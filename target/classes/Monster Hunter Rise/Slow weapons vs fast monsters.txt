[[Slow weapons vs fast monsters]]


I got a legit question. How do you main slow weapons (greatsword, hammer etc) vs fast monsters who always jump around?
I'm experimenting with weapons and immediatly said no to the heavy ones (except gunlance and cb).
Any advice/opinions?


Slow weapons benefit alot from your knowledge of monsters. Knowing when to capitalize on those openings and landing a solid hit in is the essence of playing slow weapons
    So it's the "expert mode" of the game huh? I can't see myself hammering a monsters head without memorising the patterns
        Not really, you can learn as you're fighting. And really every weapon benefits from that knowledge greatly, hammer and GS are just more focused in it
        Ehhh not really. They just really lack power if you don’t learn it. Think burst damage vs constant damage. The numbers on them will be bigger, but not as often.
            Yeah i thought so. So basically take more time to hunt mobs. And wait around for openings. Not really my thing.
                You can dance around with dual blades for 5 minutes and do constant damage or put down a trap and hit a couple of times with a gs and end the hunt right there. 

Im going to argue that the best feeling this game has to offer you is when you learn the moves of a monster you've had trouble with and stop carting altogether and start ending those hunts faster and faster.
                    Yeah i agree but just the fact that i'm so slow at walking gets frustrating. Meanwhile monsters run around or i get hit by smaller mobs while charging. Wish i could disable the smaller mobs
                        You need to learn when to sheath and unsheath your weapon. That how you get your mobility back.
                            Yeah i guess i'm too used to light weapons
                                All weapons slow you down when you unsheathe

                    Couple hundred hrs in and I'm only just starting to get "decent" with my LS counter timings.
Can 100% agree with your sentiment. When the monster and your weapon 'click', it's so satisfying.
                It depends honestly! For me I'm a hammer main through and through, and nargacuga is one of the easiest for me to hunt now. For normal MR narga I can hunt it in ehhh 3-5 minutes with hammer, depending. For a while he was my go to For afflicted farming just cause I could beat it so fast. Then I switched to seregios because he has more part breaks and I can still beat him real quick lol just depends on how well you know the monster and your bonk playstyle!
                    Narga has ONE annoying thing. Sometimes you THINK he's gonna attack but nope. Just jumping to the left for no reason at all
        Mediocre hammer one-trick here. 

Luckily the monsters are still pretty aggressive, so you don’t have to chase them as much as you might think. As you’re learning the fight, be patient. Let the monster do two or three attacks before you move in. Hammer has a surprising amount of mobility, so use it. 

While the head is pretty much always the hammer’s best hit zone, any damage is better than no damage. I’ve spent entire hunts wailing on monsters’ rear legs because that was the only safe place for me to attack until I figured out the ebb and flow of the fight. 

Honestly, Charge Breaker (I think that’s what it’s called) is a great silkbind while learning monsters. It has super armor, and you take massively reduced damage. That will let you just force your way in. And if you charge immediately after your hit, you retain the same charge level. 

Keeping Sway is the evolution of this move. You lose the attack, but trade super armor for I-frames, and you keep your charge. This makes it perfect for slipping through attacks to keep up pressure. 

These two silkbinds and Evade Window/Distance will give you a lot of grace and make you more slippery in your hunts. The hammer has a LOT of synergy throughout its entire moveset. So as you get more comfortable with what you can do, there can be this incredible flow.
            I still gotta learn the weapons. I can't really learn any of them without a 30min youtube tutorial. And to think i main cb. But yeah i'm gonna just try to get back in the game and see what i can learn. Thanks for the advice!
        Faster weapons also benefit from knowing the moveset for combos, counters, or special attacks.

With CB for example, knowing when there's going to be an opening means you can trigger your SAED/Ultra Burst at the right time.
            Axe hopper begs to differ but yeah. Often times these openings are ruined anw. Maybe i don't memorise the mobs enough? I had a hard time landing SAED before axe hopper
                Sure, the axe hopper is a safer way to land a SAED, but you also consume a wirebug to do it. Plus, you'll need to do a switch swap if it isn't presently equipped, which might cause you to miss the opening. Depends a lot on the monster and your playstyle.
                    I don't have sunbreak so no switch swaps. And i consume 1 wirebug for an saed that i can aim anywhere unlike regular saed
        A very good example is lvl 100+ gore magala. When it turns its head, its preparing for a tailslam. Either stand beneath it and charge a heavy hit or next to it on the other side and get a free hit in. Same for when it starts transforming (you can easily counter that)
You learn attack and dodge timing based on the weapon type you're using. It's not harder or easier, just a different way to play. A little less aggressive.
    Dude i saw a 2 min clip of 3 guys with barroth GS just bashing a mizitsune in the head repeatedly and keeping it stunned XD less agressive my foot. But i get what you  say. I started this game just charging in and learned the hard way that memory and attack patterns matter. Maybe i need more of that
        By "less aggressive" I mean that you can't just run in and smack it without a plan.
            But... That IS my plan! Not even joking XD sure i learn and use openings and stuff but barely ever use any items besides potions
                Nobody's talking about items. I'm saying that it's about knowing the strengths and limitations of a certain weapon type, which only comes through practice and time. Every (melee) weapon in this game has a ton of little mechanical quirks and complexities, it takes time to learn to take advantage of them.
                Ok yeah slow weapons are not very unga bunga if that's what you're looking for.
        That "2 min clip of 3 guys" was probably [this one](https://youtu.be/EJRy5Azq2ao), in which case those "guys" are Team Darkside, a rather famous group of speedrunners who abuse game mechanics to obliterate monsters.
            Yeah that's it. 4 charged attacks on the head to always stun the monster. No way you can do that solo
if you bonk them enough times they just lay down, making it much easier.

keeping sway and evade extender help to stay next to the monster. keeping sway allows you to keep the charge while you evade, you can sway thru most single hit attacks and set yourself up for a solid hit to stagger the monster.

a lot of it is using the best attack for the amount of time you have. theres not always time for a lvl 3 charge atk, but a quick 2 hit lvl 1 followed with a water strike as the monster is about to swing might fit perfectly.

you dont always have to hit the weakpoints, hammer does exhaust dmg too, a few pts in that and youve got another long opening for punishment.

and traps.

its slow af, but you can scoot around pretty good, cant go wrong with ee2 and ew3, its been the sweet spot for me.

its been my favorite weapon in rise/sunbreak, it has the most satisfying moments and the biggest "this is bullshit" moments. great weapon for all skill levels.
    I have never seen the sway skill on any equipment. Sunbreak exclusive?
        its a hammer switch skill that throws a bug out and pulls you to it.
            Oh i thought it was like armor skill
    At around HR25, basically right after beating Chameleos for the first time (without spoilers if possible), what armor would you recommend for hammer to get that evade extender and evade window skill properly?
        im not sure, i lucked out with a talisman that had both. you could try that for a bit. evade extender is all youd need to gain some range, the ew is extra for not getting hit.

later on some other armor crafting choices open up that give some more freedom, i wont spoil it more than that tho heh.
Uh hammer isn't slow, you can literally run while holding the weapon and it has a 0 wirebug counter
    I mean to hit with
        Hammer has a lot of heavy hitting opener attacks, like the blue charge upswing
Alright guys i just tried hammer and this baby is OP! THANKS for all your advice!
You need decent knowlege of the monster's patterns in order to play slow weapons effectively, or you can just spam strongarm stance lamo
Timing and positioning. Heavy weapons are harder to use and take skill. Monsters have a ton of pauses between moves, you can run in, draw attack ad wail when they are open
The monster will come to you to attack you, don’t chase it, that’s one of the most common mistakes playing slow weapon. Just stand in one place, charge your weapon and the monster will run into it
    Oh yeah my stupid palicoes keep distracting it
Hammer isn't really a slow weapon, you can still move around pretty easily and won't attack as slowly as with a gs or gunlance, while you're still not as quick as some other weapons. That's why I recommend you to start "slow weapons" with the hammer
You just predict where the Monster stands and try to position yourself more carefully... doesn't work all the time but when you hit the big numbers it's so satisfying! Also for the greatsword i  use shoulder tackle to get invincibility frames and i can dodge most to all attacks pretty easily. As a (mostly)GS main i also usually attack the tail and I think it's easier to stand in a favourable position for attacking a tail.
    Yeah i was wondering also why main hammer when you need to cut parts. Hammer can only break but gs can break and cut no?
        Hammer can stun pretty good and this gives more opportunities to hit the downed Monster. Also I would sas a good timed head bonk KO and a good timed True charge slash tail cut are equally satisfying. I love my Hammer bros 💪❤️
            Oh yeah the bonkers are... Bonkers. And watching them perform well is super satisfying but the process of learning the new weapon can be so annoying. Especially if i have to watcha 30min tutorial about all the mechanics
                i would say the hammer is one of the easier weapon's to learn. Maybe you will learn more weapons one day maybe not. I started with greatsword and later played Insect glaive back in MH4U and in world i was a hammer main and later switched to longsword in Iceborne..after that i just played with many different weapons and i had fun with every weapon in a unique way.


So just play a  weapon you like untill you want to learn another weapon and then enjoy...the most important thing is having fun
                    Yeah this is my first mh game and immediatly mained cb. Now i'm bored and looking into new weapons
                        charge blade as the first weapon? You shouldn't have a problem learning any weapon then.

I must admit that i have no idea how to play the cb and i only ever played it in 4U when i replayed the game.
                            Yeah but with cb i just main the sword and shield bit then go for the full SAED. I disregard the axe part because it's too slow. To me it's just a sword and shield with huge damage if you get the combos right
                                You're missing a TON of potential that way
                                    I played around with it and unlocked all switch skills. Axe is limited in moveset and mobility
 Power up tHe sword and shield, dance around the monster while farming charges then SAED
        Tails can sometimes be obtained from quest/target rewards too. But yes, sharp weapons allow you to cut a monster's tail. In multiplayer, hammer players can stun the monster while the blade users get easy access to the tail.

The hammer has 1 extra niche for breaking though, and that's Barroth's head. The best way to obtain a scalp is to hammer the head.
Yeah, like @MrSeaSalt said - once you get to know a monster’s three or four basic attacks and some of your heavy weapons’ main attacks, you’ll be straight. 
In Rise, the heavy weapons are so much more versatile with the wire bugs because we’re able to continue moving around while having the weapon out.
With a hammer, I’m able to continue to charge as I move around and when I see an opening, I slam it down on their heads and stun them.
    And when they do a range attack like fireball? Just dodge i guess?
        Yeah, dodging has been great - Capcom likes to do “exact reaction” actions like parrying or evading right when the hit should land. Especially in games like Street Fighter 3: Third Strike. Keeping that in mind, evading when anticipating the hit has been really helpful.
Fast monsters are that part of the game where you discover that some weapon types struggle more against certain monsters than others. You can either switch weapons for that monster, or power through it and learn their attack and movement patterns.

Hammer is actually quite decent against fast monsters, you can just hold a charge, run/weave between attacks, and punish any openings that the monster gives you. Greatsword however is a very tough weapon to master.
    Yeah i just tried the gs. You can basically tackle to keep charging but you stay immobile. You can tackle to keep charging but you HAVE to tank. Not sure i'm cool woth that
        Strongarm stance wirebug.
            Is that sunbreak exclusive? Didn't get the expansion
                It is
                    Too bad
Hammer can remain mobile while charging, so that’s less of an issue. GS requires actually being good at the game to fight the fast monsters effectively.

I play Hammer.
    I just started hammer today. The bonkening is here!
So it's the "expert mode" of the game huh? I can't see myself hammering a monsters head without memorising the patterns

        Nobody's talking about items. I'm saying that it's about knowing the strengths and limitations of a certain weapon type, which only comes through practice and time. Every (melee) weapon in this game has a ton of little mechanical quirks and complexities, it takes time to learn to take advantage of them.
        Ok yeah slow weapons are not very unga bunga if that's what you're looking for.
That "2 min clip of 3 guys" was probably [this one](https://youtu.be/EJRy5Azq2ao), in which case those "guys" are Team Darkside, a rather famous group of speedrunners who abuse game mechanics to obliterate monsters.
    Yeah that's it. 4 charged attacks on the head to always stun the monster. No way you can do that solo
its a hammer switch skill that throws a bug out and pulls you to it.
    Oh i thought it was like armor skill
im not sure, i lucked out with a talisman that had both. you could try that for a bit. evade extender is all youd need to gain some range, the ew is extra for not getting hit.

later on some other armor crafting choices open up that give some more freedom, i wont spoil it more than that tho heh.
Hammer has a lot of heavy hitting opener attacks, like the blue charge upswing
Hammer can stun pretty good and this gives more opportunities to hit the downed Monster. Also I would sas a good timed head bonk KO and a good timed True charge slash tail cut are equally satisfying. I love my Hammer bros 💪❤️
    Oh yeah the bonkers are... Bonkers. And watching them perform well is super satisfying but the process of learning the new weapon can be so annoying. Especially if i have to watcha 30min tutorial about all the mechanics
        i would say the hammer is one of the easier weapon's to learn. Maybe you will learn more weapons one day maybe not. I started with greatsword and later played Insect glaive back in MH4U and in world i was a hammer main and later switched to longsword in Iceborne..after that i just played with many different weapons and i had fun with every weapon in a unique way.


So just play a  weapon you like untill you want to learn another weapon and then enjoy...the most important thing is having fun
            Yeah this is my first mh game and immediatly mained cb. Now i'm bored and looking into new weapons
                charge blade as the first weapon? You shouldn't have a problem learning any weapon then.

I must admit that i have no idea how to play the cb and i only ever played it in 4U when i replayed the game.
                    Yeah but with cb i just main the sword and shield bit then go for the full SAED. I disregard the axe part because it's too slow. To me it's just a sword and shield with huge damage if you get the combos right
                        You're missing a TON of potential that way
                            I played around with it and unlocked all switch skills. Axe is limited in moveset and mobility
 Power up tHe sword and shield, dance around the monster while farming charges then SAED
Tails can sometimes be obtained from quest/target rewards too. But yes, sharp weapons allow you to cut a monster's tail. In multiplayer, hammer players can stun the monster while the blade users get easy access to the tail.

The hammer has 1 extra niche for breaking though, and that's Barroth's head. The best way to obtain a scalp is to hammer the head.
Yeah, dodging has been great - Capcom likes to do “exact reaction” actions like parrying or evading right when the hit should land. Especially in games like Street Fighter 3: Third Strike. Keeping that in mind, evading when anticipating the hit has been really helpful.
Strongarm stance wirebug.
    Is that sunbreak exclusive? Didn't get the expansion
        It is
            Too bad
Yeah i thought so. So basically take more time to hunt mobs. And wait around for openings. Not really my thing.
    You can dance around with dual blades for 5 minutes and do constant damage or put down a trap and hit a couple of times with a gs and end the hunt right there. 

Im going to argue that the best feeling this game has to offer you is when you learn the moves of a monster you've had trouble with and stop carting altogether and start ending those hunts faster and faster.
        Yeah i agree but just the fact that i'm so slow at walking gets frustrating. Meanwhile monsters run around or i get hit by smaller mobs while charging. Wish i could disable the smaller mobs
            You need to learn when to sheath and unsheath your weapon. That how you get your mobility back.
                Yeah i guess i'm too used to light weapons
                    All weapons slow you down when you unsheathe

        Couple hundred hrs in and I'm only just starting to get "decent" with my LS counter timings.
Can 100% agree with your sentiment. When the monster and your weapon 'click', it's so satisfying.
    It depends honestly! For me I'm a hammer main through and through, and nargacuga is one of the easiest for me to hunt now. For normal MR narga I can hunt it in ehhh 3-5 minutes with hammer, depending. For a while he was my go to For afflicted farming just cause I could beat it so fast. Then I switched to seregios because he has more part breaks and I can still beat him real quick lol just depends on how well you know the monster and your bonk playstyle!
        Narga has ONE annoying thing. Sometimes you THINK he's gonna attack but nope. Just jumping to the left for no reason at all
I still gotta learn the weapons. I can't really learn any of them without a 30min youtube tutorial. And to think i main cb. But yeah i'm gonna just try to get back in the game and see what i can learn. Thanks for the advice!
Axe hopper begs to differ but yeah. Often times these openings are ruined anw. Maybe i don't memorise the mobs enough? I had a hard time landing SAED before axe hopper
    Sure, the axe hopper is a safer way to land a SAED, but you also consume a wirebug to do it. Plus, you'll need to do a switch swap if it isn't presently equipped, which might cause you to miss the opening. Depends a lot on the monster and your playstyle.
        I don't have sunbreak so no switch swaps. And i consume 1 wirebug for an saed that i can aim anywhere unlike regular saed
But... That IS my plan! Not even joking XD sure i learn and use openings and stuff but barely ever use any items besides potions
