[[Afflicted monsters have that much hp, that they are not even fun to fight.]]


Yeah, tittle says it all.


I dont mind the hp. It's the rewards. They don't give you enough.
They're just not that fun to fight regardless. The bloodblight mechanic is dumb as shit and various weapons really struggle with the HP bloat. Trying to do damage to that Arzuros with GS (you can't strongarm TCS anything he does, and even trying to hit and run him fails because he has insta charges) just really states why certain low tier monsters were designed the way they were.

For once I'd just like an endgame with an interesting challenge rather than low effort rehashing with little thought. I'm actually at the point where I either cheese this chore with a LBG / shield HBG or just drop the game altogether.
    If you can’t beat an afflicted arzuros fast or land a tcs is because:
1. You aren’t good enough at the game
2. You don’t know your monster’s openings as tcs requires reading the monsters not just throwing it out and praying it hits
3. You might want to check your set’s dps cuz I am an average player and I can easily defeat low tier afflicted monsters in just 5 to 7 minutes.
        5-7 minutes? Yeah that’s a big cap. Post a vid or it ain’t happen.
            Right I'm feeling good about my Lil 15 min clear...although I do feel the pain since I play elemental SAED chargeblade.  

What I've found is that some of the openings are after the same moves, but you've got to  be ON it with punishing or you miss the window.  Did you overroll away?  No punish for you.  Too slow?  No punish for you.

Another thing is you can "kind" of bait out certain moves by staying at a specific distance.  E.g. stay close to medium to Goss Harag unless you want him to throw the bullshit sickle projectiles at you
        yeah 5-7 minutes hard doubt. At low tier you won't even have rarity 10 weapons
            I use Final boss hammer and that's rarity 10
        Lmao 5-7 minutes as an “average” player lmao yeah ok.
    What would be an Interesting challenge to you? Every MH so far only had HP and DMG bloat in different colours. Even MHGUs "endgame" quests where just the same old Monsters or Deviants with more HP and DMG.
        For me the endgame shouldn't really be about the challenge more than it is the grind to fun ratio.

I think they more or less had the right idea with Guiding Lands. It's just the initial execution with zone leveling was awful, and the rewards were kinda eh. And while tempered monsters were lazy and low effort, that in itself is better than the misguided attempt here. They literally speed up the monsters, changing the entire dynamic of fights in a way that feels really bizarre and out of place.
The hp sponge is stupid. It's not harder - just longer. And that doesn't make it fun. Love the expansion but afflicted is kind of lame.
Afflicted monsters are trash, I’m sorry. Main reason is because of the clusters you have to destroy to knock them over and stop the explosion. It’s just an annoying grind and you get trash rewards for it.
Yes. A lot of HP. Somewhat too muvh but not horrible. Feels like an archtempered as opposed to just tempered.
Here are the problems with Afflicted monsters:

1. Their HP is too high (10-15 minutes?)
2. They make u hit the afflicted parts for dmg making weapons with bad HZV like bow trash in solo hunts to an extent (u can work around with hitting only weakpoints but yeah now point 1 comes back)
3. They 1 shot you with most moves which not even end game monsters like Fatalis, Alatreon did unless it was a move with long animation giving you a fair chance to take action
4. Affliction always puts u < 100% health making pretty much every move one shot forcing u to pot too often discouraging you to learn the timings coz a missed counter = cart
5. All this for 2 fucking afflicted claws at the end
6. You do this from MR 20-100? seriously? (unless u r ok with spamming shitty quests for efficient MR levelups making it a chore)

The only good thing about them is some of the monsters have an extra move thats new and have faster animations making different from their regular versions
I think it sucks on the small ones as they're not supposed to be tanks. Once I fought an actual regular size monster it went by way faster as you you don't wiff as many attacks due to monster jumping around :P
    Afflicted rathian is one of the worst monsters in the game IMO.  Did you dodge the first tail flip and try to counter the second one?  HA, HAVE ANOTHER.  ENJOY HEALING THROUGH BLOOD BLIGHT AND POISON, oh wait you died from rathian run while chugging pots and taking herbal medicing(3x dash)!
It’s actually not that bad the anomaly parts when broken do more than 1600 damage a break   It more than makes up for the low damage weapons do so the hp threshold is really just double mr health if you included the anomaly breaks
    Yeah, but you have very small windows to hit them because of the low tier monsters not staying still for more than a second. And some of the clusters are in very stupid spots.
I prefer for them to have more HP so I can fight them longer. That's why I repeat quests even though I don't need the materials anymore. They are just fun to keep fighting over and over.
    I agree; endgame MH to me is just hunting for fun.
Main issue is for me having to go back for ammo all the time on afflicted.
i just fought an afflicted aknosom for 20 minutes. I was smashing it in the head, with a rarity 10 hammer, with full Dereliction blue scroll for alot of that time. Musta got like 6 knockdowns, where i went to town on its head for thousands of damage. I can only imagine how much hp the higher Tier monsters have.
I've heard this complaint a lot but how much are we talking? Normal monsters go down in sub-10min without meta sets.

I've only just beaten Malzeno since I'm taking my time and do all Quests before the Urgent so I haven't experienced the afflicted monsters yet.
    My afflicted hunts take 10-15 mins.  You can't just Unga bunga it like the monsters before.  You've gotta hit the afflicted spots for the big damage.  You've got to abuse your tools and helpers and other monsters.  

In group hunts you can spam traps and brights and stuns and such to really speed things up.
        Just finished the Afflicted Arzuros Urgent Quest a few minutes ago, took me 9:29min.

Personally, I really like the formula so far and the fact that you can use the Random Quests feature for Afflicted Monsters gets me very hyped for the continuous enjoyment of Sunbreak.

I really hope they'll also either bind Events into random standard Quests or at least give Events their own Random option since that was lacking for me in Rise.
            What do you call "random quests" ? Every quests in the game is set and not random, as far as I know... or am I missing something super important ? Or do you just speak about expeditions (which aren't quests and don't give quests rewards).
                If you use the Join Quest feature you can use the Random Quest search function which gives you whatever Quest the game finds online currently in progress. That way you don't have to decide which Quest you want to do, the game chooses for you.

Of course this only works in multiplayer, it's not a feature that solo players can use.

The feature is what allowed me to play Rise for over 600 hours despite having done basically everything after 100 or 200.

It not entailing Events was always a shame since the Events had some of the most challenging Quests.
                    Oh ok, I play solo so I didn't know, thanks for the info.
    Let's imagine they put Fatalis HP (and Fatalis damage) on Arzuros... yeah, that's kind of ridiculous.


No, I'm not joking. Afflicted Arzuros got like 50-60k HP and Fatalis has like 66k.
        Arzuros had that many? It kinda flew by for me. I just failed a couple of times because I loathe Arzuros as a monster, but when I managed not to cart too much it wasn't that long.
            My first Afflicted Arzuros took me more time than sunbreak story final boss, it was insane
                Same, lmao. In my first fight with Malzeno, I carted once and no times to Gaysmagorm and completed both fights in about 20 minutes... now granted I hate Azuros with a passion but his Aflflicated version took me 30 mins and two carts... and the carts were because I was just giving up and getting straight up bored due to how much worse the Afflicted state made the monster.
            Bruh I was so pissed that they introduced afflicted mons with fucking arzuros. He’s such a stupid monster in the same group as khezu and volvidon.
                Sorry late reply, but do people really find khezu annoying? He's one of my favorite fights
                    EXTREMELY. Spam chains roars that have zero tell so they're hard to counter, wacky af hitboxes with his stretching, looks stupid AF, his thunder attacks are cheese. Literally the worst fight in probably the entire series
                        Blangonga is a much worse fight in my opinion
                            Blangonga is also cancer but at least it dies fast. Khezu is a sponge, especially the afflicted one
                                I disagree, I find khezu to go down really fast all the time, blangonga would run around like a coked up rajang every 5 seconds making him impossible to hit
            Technically yes, that many. But you can get big number damage when the Qurio were destroyed (around 600-700 per destroyed Qurio), so it balances out to just spogier average monster.


But if you're not hitting it right, it can drag on to half an hour.
        Afflicted Azuros has 70k HP. The red dmg number you get when popping a Quorio Spot is 1% of the monsters total Health. So in a group most monsters easily have over 100k hp. Insane number but we also do much more dmg then in every other MH game.
            Wrong since mhfu the dmg went down in fu we dealt the most dmg (nuking easy white and crimson fatalys whit heroics meme build)
i think its fair game. you get good vs a certain monster sometimes you just wanna fight them for so long. also, people will find ways to get higher damage numbers when end game meta enjoyers are done.
where can i check for afflicted monsters hp ?
    mods on computer..... or kiranico.

        thank you!
Is this the Rise version for Deviant monsters of MHGU? Damn, my friends drop Rise because of lack of end game content. We enjoyed GU so much that we miss the fun of defeating all Deviants and crafting their specific armors and weapons. Damn. Good old days.
    Nope, afflicted are more like tempered monsters from World or Hypers from 4U /GenU, just with more attack spam and overall higher movement and attack speed.
use traps, cc, endemic life, stuns, other monsters, etc.... have teammates that also use hunting tools to keep the monsters chain-CCd.   


It makes the quest take like 10-15 min, even if you take 1-2min to gather stuff at the beginning. I've rarely had any Afflicted quest take longer than 10min anymore.
Ya afflicted are fine cause sets in this game are definitely way more ridiculous than World and imo they are a great for end game difficulty...
My main gripe with afflicted monsters is that they rely on stuns to kill you, before i simply got stun resist to max the only way i would die is when my monkey brain forgets to run away and i get facechecked by a rage inducing, stun inflicting explosion shoving my unfortunate fate in the way of two big red balls of fuck you. I do like the mechanics with bloodlust and the fact that i can't just rely on potion spam to win every fight. fights do take a while though...
I honestly like base monsters to have this much HP without the afflicted status. Makes them more fun to fight. With so much skills and augments a player can get so OP
Funny thing is, I had a quest for afflicted Scorned Magnamalo and Rajang. It took me 35 minutes. But I thought "Man, I got hit a lot and really sucked. Maybe I just have to train more..." So, after being almost perfect at these fights (there are only like two scorned timings i can't counter, and Rajang is so fucking easy if you use LS)..... Still 35 minutes. What the fuck? I got hit like 70 percent less, quite literally, took advantage of openings way more, and still took this long! Turns out, it's because the health of these things are just jacked as fuck
I've gotten well into anomaly quests now on Xbox and JFC, this shit is just boring as hell. 7 straight minutes of just beating the shit out of an Aknosom at level 68 just to never get hit and STILL take that long to kill the fucking thing just feels like shit. And THIS is the end game... I'm already bored at 60 hunts. About to just call it quits. There just isn't any sense of progression anymore at all with gear that seems worth the hassle of continuing to slog through this game tbh

        I disagree, I find khezu to go down really fast all the time, blangonga would run around like a coked up rajang every 5 seconds making him impossible to hit
