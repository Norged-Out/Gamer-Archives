[[TIL, some monsters are much hardereasier than previous entries.]]


Just started the game a couple days ago, only 3 carted to one monster so far, frigging HR Tobi Kadachi. I picked off Rajang NP on a random hunt he just happened to be in, but Tobi bounces around and hits like Kirin bred with Narga, and the baby did meth... I've noticed other monsters that are easier and harder than they were in World too, Anjanath, already an easy monster in World feels much easier now, Rathalos feels more in line difficulty wise with older games, being easy in world but actually threatening now. 


Wow I found rajang way more intimidating than Toni Kadachi.

But his needle/quill shots are tricky if you aren’t ready for them. Def a cool monster design

Idk if it's just me but I find Zingores in Rise annoying a difficult co pared to world. Maybe it's because I formed the tempered zinogre that drops decos
    It has a lot to do with just how much World nerfed Zinogre in general. Guy named   
Ryukishi did a video on youtube comparing the two in his "Iceborne vs. Sunbreak" thing. The first one. You can see the differences there.  
Main ones though are, he's slower in World, his tracking doesn't keep up with the increased player movement (most notable on the paw slams but this is with most monsters in world in general), and his hitboxes and hitzones are a lot more forgiving.  
World changed his big forlegs to be the weakpoints while Rise and previous games had the back legs. His full body spin hitbox is also very forgiving as you can stand much closer to him and not be hit.
Tobi Kadachi was an early game, almost damage spounge level monster in World. Surely it's not going to be that hard in Rise, ri-wait where did all my health go?
    It even has a hard knocks down, can’t wirefall attack that just few ED or risen ED has that.
For real though, i went into the tobi quest thinking, "aight, it's been awhile since I've kicked your ass, let's go" then bro proceeded to give me my first failed quest in the game
Rajang is much more manageable for me in rise compared to world
    For real though, never thought Rajang would be a monster I'd see on another hunt and be like, "Ooh, free materials!"
    Furious rajang made me quit mhw and switch to RISE.  In rise I definitely feel like I have the speed to keep up with the faster more sporadically moving monsters
I put off Barioth in rise because of the ptsd from iceborne only to completely destroy him first try a day or two later
Kushala is so hard in Rise, I had no trouble with it in World but carted so many times in Rise. 
    Because if you can headlock Kush in World it becomes a trivial fight, this needs abit of practice though. Flinch threshold on the head in Rise is 3 to 6 times higher than World, the damage increase barely reaches that but it needs caveat like GS with bomb/attack for real big SAS TCS dmg… So you pretty much gotta fight with what the monster throws out.
        Also, for all of World until IB, you could just Flashpod every time it flew for like 15 free seconds of knockdown.
A few of the monsters retained their master rank moves from Iceborne, that might make them feel harder.

Rajang is a pushover. He's barely a threat with how slow he is.
anjanath investigation in rise destroyed me
i found every monster in rise much easier, but that could just be the wirebugs. i think i only carted twice all of lr and hr. especially rajang, took me forever in world, first try in rise since we're so much more mobile.
    Rajang in Rise has a nasty trivk up its sleeve though. When he punches the ground he no longer goes on a straight line. Follows you around the prick.
        I'd like to add as well, Rajang in world never did a double laser back to back followed by a double ground slam back to back (at least for me). And this was only just High rank Rajang.   
Sunbreak Rajang moves just as much if not more than World's version. Main difference is the wind-up animations and more telegraphed stuff.
All of rise was pretty much easier than world in my opinion other than some pretty gimmicky one shot attacks
