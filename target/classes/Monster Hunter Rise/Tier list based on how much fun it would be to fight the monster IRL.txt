[[Tier list based on how much fun it would be to fight the monster IRL]]





Now try the small monster
    The smallest and easiest monsters on this list are essentially a giant bear with insanely long claws and a large raptor. The smaller monsters are lizard wolves, medium sized raptors... And in the best case scenario, flying bugs half the size of your body which can paralyze your entire body.

Possibly a bullfango or a Kelbi I guess.
        Boars are dangerous as any other large animal in the northwest. A single bullfango would be a menace to an entire neighborhood.
            True. Many people don't realize that herbivores actually are more threatening and costing more damages/injuries/death than most carnivores irl.
            I can attest to the strength of pigs. I work with wild pigs in the southeast United States. They are immensely powerful animals. All of their weight is on a compact frame and their cutters (tusks) are serious weapons. They generally won't just outright charge you, but they will defend themselves when cornered. They also wreak havoc on native species, agricultural fields, and other things.
            There's a reason that boars were one of the three animal cults for Norse berserkers alongside the bear and wolf, wild hogs are terrifying
        Kelbi is fucking immortal. You'll die of exhaustion and kelbi doesn't even have to attack.

Bullfango can easily send a hunter flying while some large monster attacks can only flinch them. They also attack from outside your field of vision 95% of the time and a single hit will shatter every bone in an average human.
        Try the shiny lizard
            even a Melynx would kick my ass üòπ
        I could definitely kick a kelbi's ass, definitely not a bulfango's lol
            Yeah? Go fight a deer right now then
        Bullfangos are the size of small horse. You aren‚Äôt fighting that.

Also deers kinda hurt, so Kelbi would too.
        I bet I could kick a jaggi's ass.
            Hunters are godlike beings,still can get outstrength by a kelbi and a jaggia,not even God can save you.
    A jaggi is still 3m long, so good luck
    They'd still mostly demolish you.
The only tier list we need
I think we could tame Kulu‚Äôs and ride them like horses
    Kweh!
    Like chocobos? üëç
        Exactly. Just scalier... waaaay more scales. 

What about the flash photographer Teet-zi? That's a mount that comes with headlights!
            Lmao, this made me chuckle...also ptsd from random flash bangs while fighting another monster.
                But you could see hunters/farmers using them as like guard animals.
    Or Wroggis, Yeeha
        It‚Äôs decided‚Ä¶ MH6 will be a monster racing game
    HOOOG RIDER!
Me personally, I think I could beat Gaismagorm's ass
    Thats the spirit
    You wouldn't happen to be a bullfango, would you?
        Well, how did you know?
            Just a hunch.
Which tierlist did you use to make this? I'm asking because this one has P. Malzeno and there's about 20 different ones and I'm not sure which one is the most updated.
    search sunbreak tierlist on google, should be the first one to pop up
I‚Äôd reckon you could take down a risen valstrax. I believe in you
Idk, I feel like I might be able to out-shimmy a kulu ya ku
Skill issue
After watching the intro to gendrome in mh4u it became clear that even the tamest monsters would body me instantly.
    We're not taking account how the Hunters are godlikes in both physical capabilities and weapon knowledge, imagine what a gendrome would do to you , knowing you are a Real Life human
Interesting would be which encounters you could survive. Cuz Kulu would probably leave you alone or even like you if you fed it or gave it pretty things.
    Trap, bomb tranq, drones. No humans required xD maybe not as good of carves tho
Espinas should be on the top. 

Just kick it once and make sure it doesn't wake up.
    And make sure to kick it lightly or else you will break your leg, that defense ain't no joke.
Weakest monster here is a literal bear
    Not just a bear it's larger than a polar bear, has bigger claws and an armored back. If Azuros were real they would be the biggest land predator on earth.
        And bro can jump 30 feet up to land on people and crush them. If you see Arzuros in an isolated area IRL, you might as well just give up bruh.
Give me any monster from this list and I will fight them with my hands tied and eyes closed. I mean I'm gonna die anyway might as well disappoint the audience while I'm at it.
    That‚Äôs not fighting, it‚Äôs called feeding. üòÇ
Tigrex in D tier is based. Fuck that guy.
I could chokeslam bishaten
I could definitely fist fight a diablos
Any one of these monsters in a real fight would cause ANY of you to immediately empty your bowels and bladder. 
Don‚Äôt let the game go to your head.
Dont worry guys i got this! *gets instantly snatched and shaken like a ragdoll*
Fan art
I feel with how much standing still it does a Kulu may be possible. Also if your fighting it in real life blades will actually be more effective.
    Ax filled with the wrath of the Bazelgeuse, capable of causing a universal cataclysm.Literally the Seething bazelguese Switch axe description
        Ok.

I feel like the biological equivalent of a bomber plane may be a little tough to take down but a oversized bird who stands still for long periods of time and has a weak spot on its neck? A skilled sword fighter with a shield should be able to face it
            Pure delusion. Kulu would be 26 feet long IRL (793cm). 

That‚Äôs like saying you could 1v1 a T-Rex with a melee weapon. 

Nobody is doing jack shit to it with a sword.
Now do the tier list but in America (with guns)
    A gun might not save you from a regular bear. So I suspect this list would be the same
        Exactly, even Australian armies once lost a war against emus, so even kulu can be very threatening.
            Australian armies? It was like 4 guys and a truck lol
    Hunters have bowguns. Basically shooting above a caliber 10x whatever gun you can have legally with chemicals we could not have and the monster usually still lives and hits you. What are you going to accomplish with a gun
        The range on bowguns is also pretty limited compared to real-world firearms (granted that is mostly for balancing purposes). On top of that, bowguns are fired from the hip, so I can't imagine the cartridge behind the round is too powerful. .308 winchester is probably more than capable of taking down at least kulu-ya-ku. Bump that up to .50 BMG and I bet there is a few more on the list that you could handle.
        Aren't the bullets from MH made with berries and teeth's and stuff like that?
Maybe real life bullets would be more effective
            Yes, but you have to remember that bones and ore in the MH universe are stronger than bones and ore IRL by an incredible amount.
    Yeah we‚Äôd still be fucked
Speak for yourself, with enough training i can probably tackle most 1‚≠êÔ∏è or 2‚≠êÔ∏è monsters mayybbbeeee. With a weapon (not a gun) and some training to get me in top shape. Yeahh i can take like a kulu ya ku easyy
    The hunters are literally Gods,have godly strength,great knowledge of weapons and still can get easily overpowered by a gendrome,you have literally no chance
        Mhmmmmmmm nahhh i think i got a chance
            I know you‚Äôre trolling, but people who think they‚Äôd have even a slight chance against any Large Monster in this series show that they‚Äôve never actually gone hunting or engaged in any sort of combat IRL. 

You would die 100% of the time to literally any Large Monster, and almost all of the Small Monsters as well. You have no chance.
            [deleted]
                Well here‚Äôs the thing. I said 1‚≠êÔ∏è or 2‚≠êÔ∏è maybbeee if im peak performance (gettt ittttt) 

I would say kulu or like izuchi isnt large or can be smaller to be taken out by a human. Especially with a sword, axe, spear (keeping it irl) absolutely.
                    Kulu, one of the smallest Large Monsters, is 26 feet long (8 meters) - it is not ‚Äúsmall‚Äù in any way. You would stand 0 chance against a prehistoric velociraptor (6 feet long), let alone a Kulu or an Izuchu. 

There is no human on earth that would survive a 1v1 fight to the death with either of these monsters.
                        Well with god all things are possible soo jot that down üòÇ
                Well if we‚Äôre talking realistically in terms of monster durability, then not 100%, even for the big ones, tho humans would be disadvantaged for sure.

Would depend on how aggressive the monster is in getting close to you and how lucky/well you can dodge any of their ranged bullshit, bc they have vulnerable weakpoints just like humans, esp the head.

Other animals are good at making prey bleed out petty easily by going for your abdomen or throat. However they often do this with their mouths (basically their heads) which humans can take advantage of by hitting their head first with a weapon (preferably one with decent reach) to end the fight.

So yeah we could probably take the more raptor sized monsters even with melee if sufficiently equipped. Having much for armor would probably not be great bc it would hinder mobility and leave you open for getting pinned but it‚Äôd be risky and a stupid thing to try anyway however just for a hat üòÇ
                    Okay, if you want to get technical, then there is a 99.99999% chance that any human will die, assuming a 1v1 fight to the death, where the human can use a melee weapon. 

Real humans would not be able to wield in-game Hammers, Great Swords, Switch Axe, Charge Blade, Gunlance, Lance, many HBG, some LBG, many Bows, etc. based purely on size and weight. 

With any IRL melee weapon, you are absolutely fucked vs. an in-game monster that can be slashed and beaten to a pulp for 10+ minutes straight without dying. You are inexcusably fucked.

Even if we remove in-game durability, you are more fucked than if you were to 1v1 a Polar Bear with a sword. You will almost certainly lose that fight as well. Period.
                        Well yeah with realistic monster durability that‚Äôs a given, if not for that we wouldn‚Äôt need huge ass weapons. So not much point in considering only partial realism.

Otherwise using a spear to poke their eye with a backup blunt swinging weapon would probably be best. A sword wouldn‚Äôt have enough reach and would require too much accuracy to get their throat/vitals I‚Äôd say - any slashing weapon really, esp if they have thick fur/skin.

Then best bet would be to try dance around it until you have a decent opportunity. If you mess up or don‚Äôt get that opportunity then you‚Äôre at high risk of losing right there. I‚Äôd say monsters aren‚Äôt too accustomed to fighting against human weapons and tactics though (ofc they can still easily overpower you).

The chance is debatable but with this said I‚Äôd (only guessing ofc) say no more than 30% chance of a human (that is capable of moving fast) winning against a monster around 2 times their size without severe injury. Prob still less than 50% of them coming out alive WITH or without severe injuries.
Is there only one version of Khezu?
    Nah there‚Äôs a red one too
I dunno man...i feel like i can beat the shit out of a Lagombi üò§ü§úüê∞
I think in real life the only practical weapons would be the ranged one and the heavy artillery like machine guns and cannons
Dont know about you but give me an ar15 and i'd happily go "Hunting" for kulu
Have you seem mhw movie? Thats real life high quality film
I think I got a shot at beating amatsu or gaimsagormü§î
I can probably take on barioth just due to the power of spite
I could fight a Arzorus granted I have a gun
If I had the right weapons and was hopped up on meth I think I could maybe fight a‚Ä¶ lagombi?
If you have honey you might have a chance with azuros but probably not fun either though.
I could kill a rock lizard
I dunno man I think I could give risen shag mag a run for his money... for at the very least half a second.
With sufficient armor I could take on 1 single vespoid
See I, personally, could fuck up a Valstrax with ease
Top tier shitpost
Kuluyaku got nothing no me.....nothing
Assuming they act exactly as they do in game in real life, I think I could comfortably survive a Rathian encounter. Fought her an ungodly amount of times
I can probably take on an aknosom considering how those legs look like twigs
Goodthing we wouldnt be the sapphire star eh? We'd be the hunters walking around the gathering hub doing collecting quests lol.
Arzuros is the closest large monster we have in real life, and prolly gonna die too üíÄ
You might be able to beat a pukei pukei if you caught it by surprise with a bat lmao. Other than that, good luck
Great jaggy should have been beatable. You beat him with LOVE... Or when it opens its mouth you throw poison in it... But we love GJ here so we dont do that
If I had my gunlance and the super human strength required to use it. I'd could atleast survive for a few minutes.
I mean, if I had to use MH weapons, yeah, definitely. But give me actual military hardware like a tank or some sort of AP rocket launcher, and I have a chance. Depending on the monster.
Can you edit it and put a kelbi in the top teir
The only monster hunter list everyone can agree with, unless you're from Florida and think you could choke hold a fucking Rajang like what they imagined in their shower.
I mean if we‚Äôre going off Monster Hunter logic you could just continuously superman dive and then kick it until it dies. I mean greatsword can kick shit why can‚Äôt we
The smallest and easiest monsters on this list are essentially a giant bear with insanely long claws and a large raptor. The smaller monsters are lizard wolves, medium sized raptors... And in the best case scenario, flying bugs half the size of your body which can paralyze your entire body.

Then best bet would be to try dance around it until you have a decent opportunity. If you mess up or don‚Äôt get that opportunity then you‚Äôre at high risk of losing right there. I‚Äôd say monsters aren‚Äôt too accustomed to fighting against human weapons and tactics though (ofc they can still easily overpower you).

The chance is debatable but with this said I‚Äôd (only guessing ofc) say no more than 30% chance of a human (that is capable of moving fast) winning against a monster around 2 times their size without severe injury. Prob still less than 50% of them coming out alive WITH or without severe injuries.
True. Many people don't realize that herbivores actually are more threatening and costing more damages/injuries/death than most carnivores irl.
I can attest to the strength of pigs. I work with wild pigs in the southeast United States. They are immensely powerful animals. All of their weight is on a compact frame and their cutters (tusks) are serious weapons. They generally won't just outright charge you, but they will defend themselves when cornered. They also wreak havoc on native species, agricultural fields, and other things.
There's a reason that boars were one of the three animal cults for Norse berserkers alongside the bear and wolf, wild hogs are terrifying
even a Melynx would kick my ass üòπ
Yeah? Go fight a deer right now then
Hunters are godlike beings,still can get outstrength by a kelbi and a jaggia,not even God can save you.
Lmao, this made me chuckle...also ptsd from random flash bangs while fighting another monster.
    But you could see hunters/farmers using them as like guard animals.
Just a hunch.
Pure delusion. Kulu would be 26 feet long IRL (793cm). 

That‚Äôs like saying you could 1v1 a T-Rex with a melee weapon. 

Nobody is doing jack shit to it with a sword.
Australian armies? It was like 4 guys and a truck lol
Yes, but you have to remember that bones and ore in the MH universe are stronger than bones and ore IRL by an incredible amount.
I know you‚Äôre trolling, but people who think they‚Äôd have even a slight chance against any Large Monster in this series show that they‚Äôve never actually gone hunting or engaged in any sort of combat IRL. 

You would die 100% of the time to literally any Large Monster, and almost all of the Small Monsters as well. You have no chance.

    Well here‚Äôs the thing. I said 1‚≠êÔ∏è or 2‚≠êÔ∏è maybbeee if im peak performance (gettt ittttt) 

I would say kulu or like izuchi isnt large or can be smaller to be taken out by a human. Especially with a sword, axe, spear (keeping it irl) absolutely.
        Kulu, one of the smallest Large Monsters, is 26 feet long (8 meters) - it is not ‚Äúsmall‚Äù in any way. You would stand 0 chance against a prehistoric velociraptor (6 feet long), let alone a Kulu or an Izuchu. 

There is no human on earth that would survive a 1v1 fight to the death with either of these monsters.
            Well with god all things are possible soo jot that down üòÇ
    Well if we‚Äôre talking realistically in terms of monster durability, then not 100%, even for the big ones, tho humans would be disadvantaged for sure.

Would depend on how aggressive the monster is in getting close to you and how lucky/well you can dodge any of their ranged bullshit, bc they have vulnerable weakpoints just like humans, esp the head.

Other animals are good at making prey bleed out petty easily by going for your abdomen or throat. However they often do this with their mouths (basically their heads) which humans can take advantage of by hitting their head first with a weapon (preferably one with decent reach) to end the fight.

So yeah we could probably take the more raptor sized monsters even with melee if sufficiently equipped. Having much for armor would probably not be great bc it would hinder mobility and leave you open for getting pinned but it‚Äôd be risky and a stupid thing to try anyway however just for a hat üòÇ
        Okay, if you want to get technical, then there is a 99.99999% chance that any human will die, assuming a 1v1 fight to the death, where the human can use a melee weapon. 

Real humans would not be able to wield in-game Hammers, Great Swords, Switch Axe, Charge Blade, Gunlance, Lance, many HBG, some LBG, many Bows, etc. based purely on size and weight. 

With any IRL melee weapon, you are absolutely fucked vs. an in-game monster that can be slashed and beaten to a pulp for 10+ minutes straight without dying. You are inexcusably fucked.

Even if we remove in-game durability, you are more fucked than if you were to 1v1 a Polar Bear with a sword. You will almost certainly lose that fight as well. Period.
