[[How is Monster Hunter Rise for a shitty gamer that just likes monsters]]


I'm hoping for some advice as I keep seeing pictures of this game and really think I'd enjoy the environments and the cool monsters, but I'm not very good at combat and I'm kinda dumb so a steep learning curve in a game isn't fun for me. I typically like to play "easy mode" on most games, even if that means grinding to level up so that I'm OP by the time I reach the boss. 

If I've played and loved Hyrule Warriors, BotW, ToTK, Witcher, and Skyrim - will I like this one? Does it also offer good exploration and cool monsters or is the gameplay mostly focused on the combat aspect? 

Thank you!

You don't wanna play Monster Hunter Rise. You want to play Monster Hunter Stories 2.
    Thanks for the suggestion! More than one person mentioned it so I'll check it out.
        Stories would be great if you just like the monsters, its got a huge roster of good monsters while letting take a more relaxed stance by nature of it being a turn based rpg as opposed it the mainline action combat
You likely won’t like it.  MH as a series is primarily about the combat.  All progression is tied to beating monsters and that takes the time, effort, and desire to want to learn the combat system (which can be punishing, especially as you approach the end of the game).  MH is basically a “boss rush” with progressively harder “bosses” and there’s no way to get around the next in line without mastering the previous one (since you don’t get stronger simply by “leveling up”).
    Thank you for that! That's exactly what I wanted to know and I think I have to put this aside for now. I do want to experience battling cool monsters so maybe when I have more time to dedicate to a game I'll try it out.
        I will add that there are certain playstyles that are comparatively easy to learn, and if you have friends or you're fine with playing with randoms (who will most likely outgear and shred lower tier monsters in a few minutes) it can still be a fun time. 

However, Monster Hunter is notorious in the sense that for the vast majority of people, it takes a few to a few dozen(!) hours to "click" with the combat. I encourage you to look at youtube guides for weapons and see if there's any you'd be interested in at all; the demo for this game is free! :)
        I can recommend monster sanctuary actually. Its on sale pretty often and it's my favourite indie game up to date. It's fairly hard for a turn based game though but the skill trees and monster skills are surprisingly deep. I would recommend you to check it put and grab it on sale!
Hmm. If you are not very good with combat, then I suggest picking up Monster Hunter Stories instead. It is a spin off game of the main series and it is turn based instead of action combat.

Monster Hunter Stories 1 will be getting a remastered for PC, switch, PS and Xbox this summer while Monster Hunter Stories 2 is now available for PC and Switch. Stories 1 is currently available for android, iOS and 3ds, however, I suggest waiting for the remastered cause the available versions won't have the japanese update which will be added for the remastered version.

Now, the game don't have easy mode cause Monster Hunter works is that they will let you start with Low Rank then High Rank and lastly, Master Rank. Low rank is like the tutorial stage where you try to pick things up as you play. Rise has the village low rank which is different for hub low rank. Village quests is easier for hub low rank quests and is the tutorial stage of the game.

Lastly, you won't be able to grind to become OP in this game. There is no levelling system and your progression is based on the armor and weapon that you can make or upgrade.
    I may have to switch to Stories as well, I haven't been able to learn action combat but still want to enjoy some parts of the franchise.
    Thanks for the suggestion! I looked at Stories a bit but thought the art in Rise was better. I might check it out anyways as I do have a Switch. Is the "low rank" part of the game long enough in Rise that I might be able to just play that and stop there? Since I just want to explore and see some monsters maybe I can just go after the easy ones and leave alone the harder ones.
        For me personally, low rank felt kinda short, even when adding the village quests to that

Then again I'm the type of person to dump hundreds of hours in a new game I enjoy.

A ton of the monsters are unlocked in high rank as well, I think over half iirc
        >Is the "low rank" part of the game long enough in Rise that I might be able to just play that and stop there?

Imo, no. Unless you feel 20 hours are enough to enjoy the game. Low rank village has 6 stars of difficulty while the hub has 3 stars, so you can do a total of 9 difficulties in low rank. The thing is, the hub just have the same monster with the village just harder and more hp. The next batch of monsters will be introduced in High Rank and Master Rank. You can spend most of your time, trying to craft all of the monster armor and weapon in low rank which could increase your enjoyment of the game.

However, the good news is that the whole game consists of two parts: Rise, which is the base game and Sunbreak, which is the expansion. The base game, Rise, consists of Low Rank and High Rank, which I think is enough for you to experience the game. If you feel that High Rank is so tough, then you can opt not to go to sunbreak because the fights will be harder since it introduces Master Rank.
            Gotcha, thanks for the info! Since it sounds like I won't get to see most of the monsters unless I'm actually good I'll wait till I actually have some time to be good.
                Np. Still, I recommend you getting MH Stories even though the art style is not the same with Rise. 

It's a way for you to enjoy the monster design. You would certainly enjoy some of the animation of the special attack, especially a certain boxing monster.
                When you finish Low Rank, you will likely have the skills and gear to take on High Rank. The difficulty spike is not huge, and if you like the monsters in Low Rank, odds are you will be hungry for more.
You get 50.minutes to complete most quests and 3 carts. Plus a buddy that can heal you. 


Is the game hard? Sort of but it is also forgiving. As you unlock more stuff you will likely opt for comfort skills over combat optimization. 


The landscapes are a lot of fun to roam.
    Is Rise generally considered easier or harder than world?
        I feel Rise is easier. It was designed for the switch. The monsters are smaller, the levels are smaller. The game is more straightforward in alot of aspects. Including eating for a hunt. The only thing that is more complicated is Palico/Palimate mechanic.


While I love World and like Rise. Rise does a way better job at lore. I still have nice things to say about Rise. There is immaturity in the fandom where some individuals feel the need to trash one game. 


My bias is though I had 500 hours on World before I played Rise though. Ultimately it comes to the individual. For the OP that likes Skyrim, World might better fit their taste. If you are enjoying it your more likely to stick with the learning curve. If people love JPRPGs then I recommend Rise because it is more their style.
            Thanks I bought Rise. Steam sale was too good to ignore.
The monsters are very great, they're the focus of the franchise, and each game in this series has a story that revolves around a specific set of monsters. But you'll need to go through the gameplay to experience it all.

This game has a grind, but Monster Hunter is about grinding materials to make equipment, not EXP. There's no levels, so you can't farm an easy monster infinitely and become strong. You need to fight a monster to make its armor and weapons, so you can fight stronger monsters and make THEIR gear. Generally, you start at Low Rank, where things are easy enough, then you progress to High Rank, where you fight the same monsters but stronger, then there's the DLC expansions which add Master Rank where everything's even stronger.
    It gets progressively harder, as you go up higher ranks AND fight against harder monster species.

There's also the weapons you use, there's 14 kinds and they have their own unique controls, combos and mechanics. Like how Long Sword is all about perfectly timing counters, or how the Bowguns are about crafting and reloading ammo while maintaining proper distance, they're all different. It's not like some other games, such as God Eater, where the controls are similar between weapons. People recommend looking up YouTube tutorial videos when learning a new weapon.

This game has a lot of learning to do, and requires a lot of practice to get better.

If it seems intimidating to you, it might actually be too much, but you should download the free demo if it's available to see for yourself.

If the complex action is too much, you can try Monster Hunter Stories, which has the same monsters and equipment, but in a turn-based monster-collecting RPG. It's a lot less intense, and you actually CAN grind levels and EXP there.
        Thanks for all the advice! You honestly make it sound so so interesting and fighting monsters is absolutely my jam, unfortunately it's time that I'm short on, which means I can't really dedicate a lot of effort or patience to this. But I might try the demo like you suggested to give myself a better idea of it.
I am a so-so Hunter. But I managed to learn enough of the mechanics to get to master rank 138, hunter rank 358. 


Find yourself a weapon that gels with you, stick with it and maybe watch a tutorial or two on YT and you will be fine. 


I had several false starts but I found my way. Went from 80 hours of gameplay to 600 in 3 months. 
It's the easiest combat of all the MH games I've played, but it is more combat-focused than like botw or anything. You have to fight monsters to advance the game, and the entertainment in playing is generally acknowledged to be the achievement of beating a monster that is particularly difficult by learning its moveset and weaknesses to take them down (if I may simply to that point). So I would definitely say the game is combat-based, but it's pretty unique from the combat in everything else I play. The monsters are cool as hell, not just in R/SB but across the whole MH universe. There are so many little or hidden parts to MH that whittling it down to just the combat aspects actually feels belittling. I mean, don't you want to slay the fuck out of a fire-breathing t-rex to make bikini armor out of its pieces? You do? Perfect, this is the game series for you!
    Haha you do make it sound very interesting and exactly the type of game I love to play. I might just have to shelve this for when I have time to dedicate to learning to play it.
Yeah this game isn't for you... The gameplay is deep and rewarding but you'll suffer a lot of you don't respect the monsters. You'll end up being frustrated and complaining about being one shot by avoidable attacks.

Have a friend like this. We keep playing but he just wants to go ungga bungga on monsters. I end up switching to a healer role just to finish the quest. He dropped mhgu since he couldn't appreciate the tools given to the player and only plays risebreak with me online to be carried. Has no desire to improve since he's being one shot constantly and just says gameplay hard... 

Don't get this game man. If you really like the monsters though, monster hunter stories gives you a pokemon flavored taste of it.
    Lol a pokemon flavored taste does sound like it might be more my thing. I'm not the type to complain a game is too hard or not try to improve, I just have to know my limits. I'm not good at certain types of games but I love exploration and monsters so thought I might be able to get by here just being passably good... but by the advice here it seems that won't be the case with this one. I'll probably just try another game entirely until I have time to dedicate to learning to play this one.
        If you want to try it though, risebreak would be your best bet. I feel it gives the players a lot of tools to handle monsters. Something that some people don't like... Makes the game too easy and boring they say. There are weapons that are easy to pick up though. And you'll only have to understand positioning and timing after.

 I think there's a demo if you are on steam. It won't reflect the deeper aspects of the game though. Armor building and qurio crafting are for those who know what they want in the game. Which skills to grab and just how many levels of it, the demo has set skills but should give you a decent idea of combat flow.
I think aside from Stories, all Monster Hunter games have a steep learning curve. They're easier if you've played other previous MH games, but even then you'll want to look up guides/ videos on optimal equipment & movesets.

If you're completely new, you need to research like you're trying to write a thesis. And then practice...

At least in my experience, Monster Hunter is a lot of work. 😂 (so fun if you can get the hang of it though 👌)
Yes! You WILL love Rise, but you have to put in 20+ hours to get it. It’s a bit complicated but totally worth it. Not hard, but the button combinations take a while to learn/master.
It’s a toss up for me. My gf played all those games you did and it took a while to learn but she was able to play mhw and then rise it just takes patience
yeah like some others said, the mainline games arent probably for you. HOWEVER the series does have a monster taming spin off known as Monster Hunter Stories! Where you get to hatch baby monsters from eggs, genetically mutate them to give them fancy new abilities, and fight along side them in battle! 

Mileage may vary based on how much you tolerate ai controlled party members
Not trying to push it on you but I'm generally absolutely rubbish at fast action combat and I've managed to get fairly far into Rise. (Amatsu got me stuck AF though someone end me I hate that thing.)

I went from absolutely not being able to with the 4U demo to playing Stories instead to somehow actually doing okay in 3U and even better in Gen despite not having practiced anything remotely fast paced combat. Village 9* in Gen U before it started getting really hard and I started carting, which probably isn't crap but I'm impressed considering.

Then Rise has been a billion times easier for me than Gen U overall lol

Point is you might be surprised but regardless I'd say wait for a sale. Especially because base game is... Lacking imo. (Seriously the bulk of it feels like it's in the paid DLC. :/)

Honestly I think you should try it, it was my first mon hun game and it's progression gives you time and you can slowly pitch away at It and you will learn your weapon mechanics and eventually get good enough to prog to end game. It's worth it for the experience i think to see and you might end up rising to the challenge and beat the game like I did. So worth imo
You remind me of my friend lol, she practically gave up on fighting the monsters and just likes to explore and take pictures with the in-game camera for the achievements. As long as she has fun.

I wouldn’t spend money on it for that reason alone though, it’s a pretty hard game if you’re not good at combat and you can only grind so much, it’s not a game where you can “overlevel” in any way. Maybe try Monster Hunter: Stories, this might be more your speed.
As someone who's not a die hard monster hunter fan (the rest of the games' controls were way to clunky for me) Rise is the only one I was able to get into. Playing through the main story and the Expansion should be doable even for a slightly unskilled gamer. (Lots of weapon types which are basically different classes. Odds are one will fit your abilities) I myself probably won't progress past that since the endgame (Anomaly Investigations) are way too punishing for my tastes. and I consider myself a highly skilled *casual* gamer. (I.e. I'm good but don't play like soulsbourne games and such. Hardest thing I've ever pulled off in a videogame is beating Sephiroth in Kingdom Hearts 2 on Proud mode.)

Try it! You might like it and even if you don't at least you'll know. Rise is actually deemed too easy for most monster hunter fans. It's definitely a good and easy starting point for getting into the series.
To be fair, Rise and World are probably the “easiest” mainline Monster Hunter games to get into for new players (especially Rise) thanks to so many blessed quality of life changes. I imagine playing the older games like Freedom Unite or 3 Ultimate would either be a miserable or very hard experience for you.

Even for Rise, this is a series you definitely need to set a lot of dedicated time for to play and learn just like if one wishes to be good at fighting games online.

The “Pokemon” spin-off like the Monster Hunter Stories games might be a better fit for you. But, if you feel like jumping into any of the main games just prepare to learn a lot.

I jumped right into the series when I was like in 6th grade just fine though so who knows? Maybe you’ll enjoy it.
It is by no means "easy", but I will say that I died less in MH Rise as a MH virgin by playing lance and sword and shield than I did playing TOTK. Not to say TOTK is some massively difficult game, but I was kinda surprised and think the difficulty is a little bit overblown online for Rise at least. I generally play easy mode on most games as well
Play the Stories series of Monster Hunter. Turn based combat and loads of monsters from the main line for you to enjoy.

Still..

If you want to try Rise if you can make it to Sunbreak you get party members who can make the game easier. If you do play Rise use the Sword and Shield you don't need to sheathe to use items or sharpen your weapon.
MH doesn't hold your hand. It will toss you from the pan into the fire and straight up tells you to get better or be stuck where you're at.
While the very end of Rise and a lot of it’s end game in the Sunbreak expansion gets very hard, the vast majority of the early, mid and even part of the endgame are very manageable by casual players. The biggest thing is, the weapons. As you may or may not know, there are 14 weapon types in the game, which means you have access to 14 different movesets and playstyles (which you can slightly customise, so there are actually even more possibilities). And each moveset is pretty complex, there are many moves and combos, and there are so much cool stuff you can do with each weapon THAT THE GAME DOESN’T TELL YOU. Some players prefer to figure out how their weapon works by playing, just winging it. That can be fun, but you can also be in the situation of finding out a life-changing move exists after hundreds of hours. And you might feel frustrated with a weapon or the game, it can feel unfair if you’re not using every advantage you can get. Otherwise, (and this is my preferred way of doing things), there are tutorials on YouTube or in articles online detailing every single thing a weapon can do. This helps knowing what’s actually going on, and makes learning the game easier. It’s generally recommended for beginners to the franchise to try out multiple weapons before committing to one, as the gameplay changes a lot and some weapons are harder to master than others (for exemple, the Greatsword is a giant broad blade bigger than your hunter that focuses on huge slow heavy hits. It looks awesome, so many beginners are drawn to it, but you move very slowly, and your hits are slow as well, so it’s very easy for monsters to get away or hit you to interrupt your moves. The real potential of the weapon requires you to anticipate the monster movements, but that’s very difficult for first time players.) it’s very probable you’re going to get frustrated with the game at some point, but there is always something you can do to make your experience go smoother. 
By the way, the game has a big time requirement, and the end game is pretty grindy, which is ok if you like the gameplay but if that’s not your thing maybe you won’t like the game
I would say you should play rise. It could be the first game that clicks as a difficult game. If you like grinding this game is full of it. Not much of an easy mode, but if you give it a chance the difficulty curve, especially in rise, is very forgiving.


Imo stories is a pretty boring monster quest joker sidegrade. I think it might be too easy/simple for your tastes.


Keep in mind I have only played the first one through. I did not make it all the way through. Obnoxiously long battle animations killed it.


Just a heads up, none of these games even scratch the surface of a witcher type story. Very very very gameplay first type game. Story barely even matters in them minus world (which is still tacked on). Not a bad thing to me, but worth noting.


Gotta be my top 3 series for me though. Scratches that progression grind itch and the menus are *chefs kiss* perfection.
    I was interested in it mainly for a chance to battle some cool monsters, I don't have to have a story if the graphics are good (and I'm not sure there is much out there that gets even close to a Witcher type story... those games are the peak of story-telling for me). But I'm going to be so bummed if I hit a wall and can't go off to battle said cool monsters :(  That said, people here have made it sound so interesting that I'm wanting to play it even more now. I think I will have to at least try it out.
It is not for you. Believe me. 

Monster Hunter is all about it’s complex and dynamic combat. I would rate it as some of the higher difficulty games out there. I enjoy a challenge, love the souls franchise etc. and Monster Hunter humbled me big time in realizing how fucking bad I suck. 

I still love it, but from your description I am very sure that you won’t.
i can’t, in good faith, recommend monster hunter in general for you based on what you’ve said. monster hunter games are primarily focused on combat. each weapon features a sizeable list of combos and for most weapons you will need to know your combos and know when to execute them in order to succeed in monster hunter. positioning and understanding the monster’s attack patterns and weaknesses is also vital, and it doesn’t sound like you’re too into getting involved in the learning curve of fighting difficult bosses. all in all, i’d recommend AC Odyssey or something along the lines of open world RPG with simple, easy and fun combat.

then again, monster hunter rise, imo, is one of the easier monster hunter games. if you want to start getting into combat focused games, maybe this could be your entry.
You are going to get one shot every session. Like me. I like it.
iirc there's a demo for rise you could use to help get a feel for the game, but based on what you've said, the stories games may be more up your alley. the main mh games focus p much solely on combat, and reward you for learning the ins-and-outs of its combat system. the jump from LR to HR can feel like a lot, speaking from experience. but as someone who doesn't usually play games like this and only started playing it bc i thought the monsters were cool, i've come to really love rise and im currently working through mhworld. if you can borrow a copy from a friend or get the demo (if it's still available) then it's worth a try if you're on the fence about it, cuz you might end up liking it!
The game is 99% combat and takes focus and concentration. Based on what you've said you'd probably be fine with the village quests, as those are easy, but that's just the tutorial of the game. A lot of people will say that rise isn't hard, but that's because they, and me included have been playing MH for such a long time we've mastered it's combat. I can totally see a first-timer, especially one not that great at combat focused games struggling with the game.
  
If it's just the monsters you're after you could consider the spin off MH stories games, but those have a wildly different artstyle and feeling, monsters are the same though.
You might enjoy playing MH World more than MH Rise. It's more immersive lots of things to explore in the environment.
If you ever want to try the « mainline » games, try grabbing Monster Hunter World on sale, like 5 dollars if you ever see a deal like that
The way you describe things you want Monster Hunter World. That's the one that's focused on environments and ecology, while MH Rise focuses on combat. That said they can be hard to get into, I wouldn't say that they are necessarily hard, but they play quite a bit different from most game since you really commit to moves. So if you spam buttons you will get hit, but in turn monsters are easily avoidable if you focus on avoiding them instead of attacking, so you can take your time with the fights.
This game has a steep learning curve but, having played the original, its far more user friendly than the older games. Lots on here probably would stick their nose up to me and my play style but I really don't find it too hard to get enjoyment with Dual Blades as my main weapon. I'm at level 6 hunts and just button mash a few combos and roll out of the way. Use mainly just potions and antidotes and have only been knocked out a handful of times. I know I've only scratched the surface on some content and hardly playing optimized but as a middle aged dad who plays a few hours a week, its honestly a relaxing game. Nothing like the stress inducing nightmare of the original. If you can live with just having fun and not trying to optimize everything, I actually recommend this game. I think the learning curve and grinding is keeping people from what is essentially just Minecraft for me. Instead of grinding to build some wacky contraption, I'm grinding to make cool boots.
Rise was my first monster hunter.  I love the game. However, over-simplifying, it’s a lot like playing the old capcom arcade street fighter games, but in 3 dimensions against giant monsters.  

While you do explore the areas, learn tricks, make cool armor and swords, it’s definitely not focused on a RPG style story like Witcher.  Teaming up with people is very enjoyable.
Monster Hunter is almost completely about combat. There's no such thing as grinding to level up. The learning curve is not steep, you can take as long as you like to get good, but ultimately the game is about you learning what moves you have, what moves the monsters have, and which buttons to press in response to the monster's moves.


Of all the Monster Hunter games, Rise is the most new-player friendly. Although the game is all about skill, you don't need very much of it to finish the main story. There is also a great variety of weapons, all with their own play style, and you can choose a weapon and build that suits you. There are some cheesy builds that aren't optimal, but are simple to play and will get you through the game.


Of the games you mentioned, I've played Witcher and Skyrim. If you've beaten those, you can probably beat the main story of Rise and Sunbreak. Imagine Witcher, except every fight is a boss fight, the combat is several times more interesting, and they've removed 90% of the exploration and story.
If you like exploration and cool monsters, World might be better for you. (Or the Stories spinoffs) Rise's mechanics skew a lot more toward the combat. You can't really grind in this game besides getting better gear (often locked behind your next fight) so there's no overleveling to do.
there are actually many ways to deal with monsters but, sooner or later, you will have to be able to combat them.

getting to know the monsters is a great part of the hunt. Once you know the monsters you're hunting, their attacks, their attack elements or effects, their weakness, the environment you'll be fighting them in, you can prepare better to make the hunt easier.

some hunters like to specialize on one weapon, I myself use multiple weapons because I find some weapons help me fight some monsters better. 

My 'main' used to be Sword and Shield, when I don't know enough about the monster, I use Sword and Shield.  It's agile, flexible, and simple to use, although it didn't deal great damage like Great Sword or Hammer. 

Currently, near end game, when in doubt, I use Lance. It's not as agile or flexible as Sword and Shield, but definitely much safer. Equipped with the right skills, I can just block  like 99% of the monsters attack without worrying too much.

There are many helpers that can help make your hunt easier: traps, flash bombs, sonic bombs, paralyzing insect, etc. 

And you can forge weapons and armor that match the monsters attacks and weaknesses.
    Thanks for the advice! If I do decide to try it out I'll use your weapons tips.
Try World instead. I think Rise is a better game ultimately, but World might be your jam. Hell you might even like Rise after trying World, which is what happened to me.
    Huh I really couldn't get into World and personally found it to be a bit harder than Gen/Gen U for me to play.
        I think World has a better ramp up for newer folks like myself. It’s annoyingly slow at times but I think that’s a good thing. It’ll also make players appreciate the experience in everything in Rise
            Fair enough

I actually somehow felt like I was hit with too much, probably in part because the world felt so big tbh

Like Rise doesn't feel near as big to me, and the action doesn't feel more. But I wasn't entirely a new player when I tried, just not very good imo lol
If anything MH World would be the better alternative for you. Fighting monsters is the meat and potatoes, but unlike MH Rise World has a lot of other stuff for you to explore.
Thanks for the suggestion! More than one person mentioned it so I'll check it out.
    Stories would be great if you just like the monsters, its got a huge roster of good monsters while letting take a more relaxed stance by nature of it being a turn based rpg as opposed it the mainline action combat
Thank you for that! That's exactly what I wanted to know and I think I have to put this aside for now. I do want to experience battling cool monsters so maybe when I have more time to dedicate to a game I'll try it out.
    I will add that there are certain playstyles that are comparatively easy to learn, and if you have friends or you're fine with playing with randoms (who will most likely outgear and shred lower tier monsters in a few minutes) it can still be a fun time. 

However, Monster Hunter is notorious in the sense that for the vast majority of people, it takes a few to a few dozen(!) hours to "click" with the combat. I encourage you to look at youtube guides for weapons and see if there's any you'd be interested in at all; the demo for this game is free! :)
    I can recommend monster sanctuary actually. Its on sale pretty often and it's my favourite indie game up to date. It's fairly hard for a turn based game though but the skill trees and monster skills are surprisingly deep. I would recommend you to check it put and grab it on sale!
I may have to switch to Stories as well, I haven't been able to learn action combat but still want to enjoy some parts of the franchise.
Thanks for the suggestion! I looked at Stories a bit but thought the art in Rise was better. I might check it out anyways as I do have a Switch. Is the "low rank" part of the game long enough in Rise that I might be able to just play that and stop there? Since I just want to explore and see some monsters maybe I can just go after the easy ones and leave alone the harder ones.
    For me personally, low rank felt kinda short, even when adding the village quests to that

Then again I'm the type of person to dump hundreds of hours in a new game I enjoy.

A ton of the monsters are unlocked in high rank as well, I think over half iirc
    >Is the "low rank" part of the game long enough in Rise that I might be able to just play that and stop there?

Imo, no. Unless you feel 20 hours are enough to enjoy the game. Low rank village has 6 stars of difficulty while the hub has 3 stars, so you can do a total of 9 difficulties in low rank. The thing is, the hub just have the same monster with the village just harder and more hp. The next batch of monsters will be introduced in High Rank and Master Rank. You can spend most of your time, trying to craft all of the monster armor and weapon in low rank which could increase your enjoyment of the game.

However, the good news is that the whole game consists of two parts: Rise, which is the base game and Sunbreak, which is the expansion. The base game, Rise, consists of Low Rank and High Rank, which I think is enough for you to experience the game. If you feel that High Rank is so tough, then you can opt not to go to sunbreak because the fights will be harder since it introduces Master Rank.
        Gotcha, thanks for the info! Since it sounds like I won't get to see most of the monsters unless I'm actually good I'll wait till I actually have some time to be good.
            Np. Still, I recommend you getting MH Stories even though the art style is not the same with Rise. 

It's a way for you to enjoy the monster design. You would certainly enjoy some of the animation of the special attack, especially a certain boxing monster.
            When you finish Low Rank, you will likely have the skills and gear to take on High Rank. The difficulty spike is not huge, and if you like the monsters in Low Rank, odds are you will be hungry for more.
Is Rise generally considered easier or harder than world?
    I feel Rise is easier. It was designed for the switch. The monsters are smaller, the levels are smaller. The game is more straightforward in alot of aspects. Including eating for a hunt. The only thing that is more complicated is Palico/Palimate mechanic.


While I love World and like Rise. Rise does a way better job at lore. I still have nice things to say about Rise. There is immaturity in the fandom where some individuals feel the need to trash one game. 


My bias is though I had 500 hours on World before I played Rise though. Ultimately it comes to the individual. For the OP that likes Skyrim, World might better fit their taste. If you are enjoying it your more likely to stick with the learning curve. If people love JPRPGs then I recommend Rise because it is more their style.
        Thanks I bought Rise. Steam sale was too good to ignore.
It gets progressively harder, as you go up higher ranks AND fight against harder monster species.

There's also the weapons you use, there's 14 kinds and they have their own unique controls, combos and mechanics. Like how Long Sword is all about perfectly timing counters, or how the Bowguns are about crafting and reloading ammo while maintaining proper distance, they're all different. It's not like some other games, such as God Eater, where the controls are similar between weapons. People recommend looking up YouTube tutorial videos when learning a new weapon.

This game has a lot of learning to do, and requires a lot of practice to get better.

If it seems intimidating to you, it might actually be too much, but you should download the free demo if it's available to see for yourself.

If the complex action is too much, you can try Monster Hunter Stories, which has the same monsters and equipment, but in a turn-based monster-collecting RPG. It's a lot less intense, and you actually CAN grind levels and EXP there.
    Thanks for all the advice! You honestly make it sound so so interesting and fighting monsters is absolutely my jam, unfortunately it's time that I'm short on, which means I can't really dedicate a lot of effort or patience to this. But I might try the demo like you suggested to give myself a better idea of it.
Haha you do make it sound very interesting and exactly the type of game I love to play. I might just have to shelve this for when I have time to dedicate to learning to play it.
Lol a pokemon flavored taste does sound like it might be more my thing. I'm not the type to complain a game is too hard or not try to improve, I just have to know my limits. I'm not good at certain types of games but I love exploration and monsters so thought I might be able to get by here just being passably good... but by the advice here it seems that won't be the case with this one. I'll probably just try another game entirely until I have time to dedicate to learning to play this one.
    If you want to try it though, risebreak would be your best bet. I feel it gives the players a lot of tools to handle monsters. Something that some people don't like... Makes the game too easy and boring they say. There are weapons that are easy to pick up though. And you'll only have to understand positioning and timing after.

 I think there's a demo if you are on steam. It won't reflect the deeper aspects of the game though. Armor building and qurio crafting are for those who know what they want in the game. Which skills to grab and just how many levels of it, the demo has set skills but should give you a decent idea of combat flow.
I was interested in it mainly for a chance to battle some cool monsters, I don't have to have a story if the graphics are good (and I'm not sure there is much out there that gets even close to a Witcher type story... those games are the peak of story-telling for me). But I'm going to be so bummed if I hit a wall and can't go off to battle said cool monsters :(  That said, people here have made it sound so interesting that I'm wanting to play it even more now. I think I will have to at least try it out.
Thanks for the advice! If I do decide to try it out I'll use your weapons tips.
Huh I really couldn't get into World and personally found it to be a bit harder than Gen/Gen U for me to play.
    I think World has a better ramp up for newer folks like myself. It’s annoyingly slow at times but I think that’s a good thing. It’ll also make players appreciate the experience in everything in Rise
        Fair enough

I actually somehow felt like I was hit with too much, probably in part because the world felt so big tbh

Like Rise doesn't feel near as big to me, and the action doesn't feel more. But I wasn't entirely a new player when I tried, just not very good imo lol
Stories would be great if you just like the monsters, its got a huge roster of good monsters while letting take a more relaxed stance by nature of it being a turn based rpg as opposed it the mainline action combat
I will add that there are certain playstyles that are comparatively easy to learn, and if you have friends or you're fine with playing with randoms (who will most likely outgear and shred lower tier monsters in a few minutes) it can still be a fun time. 

However, Monster Hunter is notorious in the sense that for the vast majority of people, it takes a few to a few dozen(!) hours to "click" with the combat. I encourage you to look at youtube guides for weapons and see if there's any you'd be interested in at all; the demo for this game is free! :)
I can recommend monster sanctuary actually. Its on sale pretty often and it's my favourite indie game up to date. It's fairly hard for a turn based game though but the skill trees and monster skills are surprisingly deep. I would recommend you to check it put and grab it on sale!
For me personally, low rank felt kinda short, even when adding the village quests to that

Then again I'm the type of person to dump hundreds of hours in a new game I enjoy.

A ton of the monsters are unlocked in high rank as well, I think over half iirc
>Is the "low rank" part of the game long enough in Rise that I might be able to just play that and stop there?

Imo, no. Unless you feel 20 hours are enough to enjoy the game. Low rank village has 6 stars of difficulty while the hub has 3 stars, so you can do a total of 9 difficulties in low rank. The thing is, the hub just have the same monster with the village just harder and more hp. The next batch of monsters will be introduced in High Rank and Master Rank. You can spend most of your time, trying to craft all of the monster armor and weapon in low rank which could increase your enjoyment of the game.

However, the good news is that the whole game consists of two parts: Rise, which is the base game and Sunbreak, which is the expansion. The base game, Rise, consists of Low Rank and High Rank, which I think is enough for you to experience the game.
