[[Keanu Reeves Says He's Never Played Cyberpunk, Despite CD Projekt Red Saying He Loved It]]





Keanu Reeves: "It moved me"

&#x200B;

"To a bigger house"
    Well, what's important is that gamers learn a valuable lesson about the nature of celebrity endorsements and sponsored content.

...

......

.........we did learn that lesson right?
        That Keanu thought it was the biggest compliment people modding the game to have sex with his character. That was the lesson I learned.
            [deleted]
                The recent interview he did with Carrie-Anne Moss he laughed about it and said it was a compliment while Carrie stated that she would hate it if it was a character based on her.

                        Yeah, I'd even say keannus feelings are probably a little more complicated than the interview suggests. He spoke sarcastically a few times in the interview and with his inflection it's pretty hard to tell the difference.
                            > with his inflection it's pretty hard to tell the difference

Gen X for the win. We don't even know when we're being sarcastic
                                You're so right. There i go doing it again! Naw I'm just "fucking around"
                                This made me spit out of coffee, no joke..

..but im on the toilet, and I'm not drinking coffee.
                                Isn’t he technically a boomer?
                                    Wikipedia defines Gen X as born '65-'80. He was born Sept '64. 

He is undeniably a Gen X icon, becoming famous during the early 90s. Hell, he was even in a rock band in the 90s.
                        I think that both their reactions (Keanu being stoked and Carrie-Anne being offput) are both completely reasonable.

                    Don't mind me.  I am definitely not over here.... umm... deleting my Mass Effect mods of Aria.

These are mods of an Aria from a different game.  Yea. You wouldn't know it.

                    "Female celebrity gets shocked horny men fantasize about her"
                    He was especially pervy in that interview.. He let his guard down more than he normally does.
                    [deleted]
                        That would be CDPR.

It's for legal reasons because it involves the physical likeness of a person, even with Keanu's apparently carefree endorsement of the practice I 1000% understand where they're coming from.
                            Yep they basically just said that we want to be able to book people without having to have them worry about them being forced into sex scenes


Reasonable really
                            Once you say it's okay for Modders to make graphic sex scenes with your celebrity endorsement lookalikes models good luck getting other celebrity endorsements
                            Especially after what happened with ~~Ellen~~ Elliot Page in that one game.
                                Ootl?
                                    Beyond: two souls. Hackers/modders managed to find the full video picture in the game files or something and added a mod so during a shower scene you could see her (at the time) nude.
                                I forgot all about the Ellen page hack. Still kind of weird that Quantic Dream rendered a nude model for her in-game. Seemed a little unnecessary
                                    It was David Cage specifically, dude is a grade A creep and I wouldn't be surprised if it came out that he was another sex pervert.
                                    BTW, his name's Elliot
                        Yeah fuck the guys telling weird stupid losers to not make mods to fuck a celebrity in their mediocre shitfest game.
                            Idk, I doubt they’re stupid if they’re making these mods. Just weird losers, not weird stupid losers loool

Double Fist Pump when he finds out it was "him" that was the most requested.
            I'm modding Keanu with big dicks and big ass
        You know what, Reeves' involvement almost certainly was the reason I bought the game, *pre-ordered* the game, I'm not usually one to do such things.

That and the Witcher studio being involved I suppose.

Now your comment made me realise that advertising does work because without Keanu I def wouldn't have been so interested and I didn't even realise that until now.

So thanks for opening my eyes, Advertising doesn't work on me was a little ego trip I used to have. Not anymore.
            Advertising works especially well on people who think they’re immune to it because those people truly believe their wants and desires are organic.
            Glad to hear it, sorry you had to learn the hard way.  I learned the hard way with No Man's Sky myself.  How susceptible I was to the hype market.

Not anymore.  No more preorders, never on launch.  Between price drops and patches, someone on r/patientgamers told me something that's stuck with me ever since: 

"When you buy a game at launch, you're pay the highest price for the worst version of the game."
                New World sends its regards.
                    Fallout 76, Battlefield 2042, Halo Infinite etc. etc. Not as bad as No Man's Sky but pretty bad. That was where I learned my lesson but I didn't even buy NMS. Just watched everyone else get upset after they wasted their money and decided I would never preorder.

Death Stranding

Hitman 3

&#x200B;

I was happy pre-ordering these games, and did not regret. Just be careful i guess when a games has a hype train going strong.
            Tbh he was a much much bigger part of the game then I thought he was going to be, he’s basically the main and best character in the game.
            I played cyberpunk for the first time a few weeks ago when I bought it on sale on a whim. It’s actually pretty fun. But it still feels kinda half finished. The sex scenes are terrible, the “shards” are way too many and annoying. Vehicle driving which is a huge part of the game is terrible.

And it’s really buggy, like random floating text, crashes, audio problems, visual glitches. And this is on a pc with a 3090. 

But it was better than I was expecting, and Keanu reeves was the best part
            When they introduced him for the first time in the game quite a lot of ppl went crazy over it... and I could not understand why. Ok, CD Red hired a well known actor but would that mean the game had good code or a well written story ?
        It made zero sense to me that people were ready to declare the game the must play game of the year just because Keanu was in it, like celebrities in games have ever made the game undeniably better
            Im pretty sure the hype for this game was huge well before all of the keanu publicity
                True, very true. That first trailer (2013 I think) was basically just a still image and people were way too excited for it.
                    I remember exactly what I thought and even how I felt when I first learned of CP2077.  I wasn't so much excited about the game itself but more about the fact that CDPR was doing it and that basically guaranteed something amazing.  For my part, I loathe this game and I refused to jump on the hate bandwagon at first but seriously, this game is categorically a pile of shit.  It's unfixable.  It's unpatcheable.  Just needs to be remade completely or abandoned.  Off topic, I know.
                        Their first mistake in a world of extreme (or supposed to be extreme) body modifications was to make it first person. Can’t see my clothes, or anything that makes my character unique.
                            but hey what about that *one* functioning mirror
                            Yeah that's why I never considered buying it even before people were upset. As soon as I saw 1st person I wasn't interested anymore
                                I still don’t understand the choice. Game would have been amazing even in its broken state with that.
                        >more about the fact that CDPR was doing it and that basically guaranteed something amazing.

What? Your talking about CDPR right? The Witcher 1 & 2 were mediocre and TW3 was a buggy broken mess at launch. CDPR was having news about crunch and lead devs leaving for years after TW3 launch and before CP2077.

Why the hell did you think that CDPR making it would mean it would be good. That's like believing that a Bioware game now means that it would be good.
                            [deleted]
                                What? Witcher 2 was huge, which is why there was a ton of hype for 3. I was watching gaming YouTube around that time so I saw it for myself
                                It sold 1.7 million copies in the first week...
                        I thoroughly enjoyed the game  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
                        I agree man. I managed to buy a ps5 this spring and I still haven’t bothered to try cyber punk on next gen. The game was just plain bad and missing lots of content that CD promised us beforehand, but quietly ignored once the focus became more the bug filled glitchy game
                From what I read it was turning out to be a great game before Keanu got onboard.  The execs had the devs change up the story and leave out parts of the game to accommodate the new main character.
                    [deleted]
                        I don't think it's really fair to say he was part of thr problem, I doubt he demanded that he be put in way more of the game. My guy hasn't even played it so I don't think he really gives a shit about video games or having a prominent role in one.

Somehow, somebody got a hold of his agent and pitched the idea, Keanu went yeah alright that might be kinda fun and they're paying me a lot, and CDPR made the decision to change everything around him.
                            I don't think these guys are saying Keanu set out to ruin the game like it's his fault. They are saying simply including him so late in the process caused the development schedule to fail.
                    I'd say it's more accurate to frame it as "It was turning out to be a great game before CDPR went public and the execs decided to recruit a celebrity name for mass appeal to appease investors while" still fitting the cyberpunk feel""

That said, I can't go wrong with Keanu Reeves.
            Willem Dafoe in Beyond Two Souls?
                He’s in that?
            The plethora of famous actors doing the voices in GTA: Vice City definitely made the game better (for me).
            For me, the reveal was exciting because I thought Keanu Reeves had that unique vibe to him that suited the sort of folk hero rocker that is Johnny Silverhand.

Otherwise, yeah it’s a case by case basis for me. Heck, in some cases, the celebrity made the game worse, like Matthew Perry in New Vegas or Mena Suvari in Kingdom Hearts.

And then you have Tim Curry in Red Alert 3 and he automatically elevates everything with the amount of ham on display.
                Matthew Perry's deliveries are pretty iconic. I'm not saying the guy was acting his heart out or anything and a lot of it rests on the strength of the writing but Benny's a memorable character and he added to that.
                While I understand your point and your example is valid, I liked Matthew Perry in New Vegas, I suspect a reasonable percentage of players do.
                Perry was spot on as a sleazy 50s gambler / mobster. And he was an actual fan of the game, as opposed to Keanu.

*'I hit what I was aiming for. Guess you had brains to spare'*
                I've heard almost nothing but positive reception about Matthew Perry as Bennie..
                There's a good chance Keanu being in the game fucked it. Scuttlebutt is the game was supposed to have a whole different story and do more with the lifepaths but a lot of stuff got binned or hurriedly repurposed to serve the Johnny Silverhand storyline.
                    My head cannon with no absolute basis in reality is that Keanu reeves would cameo as Johnny silverhand in one of their many quests and when they found out they couldn't deliver such a large scoped game they scaled it down and turned his cameo into the whole story of the game.
                    Too many fundamental features were left in a state of "that'll do" for me to really believe this. I'd say bringing Keanu on in such a large role is just another symptom of the problem.
                Whoa whoa whoa! Matt Perry was a damn good Benny! Let’s keep it in the groove, okay my man? Smooth moves, like smooth little babies.
                You take that back, perry in new vegas was pretty great!
            You could say the same of films. Some films he's done have been nigh unwatchable. Doesn't meant you can't be happy he's in it.
            It's not unreasonable to be excited about something, because your favorite actor is in it
                he is overrated as fuck, especially on reddit
            Brutal Legend. Just wouldn't be the same.
            It was the must play game because it was going to be The Witcher 3 in a futuristic setting. Keanu being in the game was just a nice little cherry on top.
            That Russian therapist definitely made until dawn better. Although he's not exactly the most famous actor out there.
                John Abruzzi shoutout.
            Play Dishonored. Mike Madsen, Brad Dourif, Susan Sarandon, to name a few. Game is fucking iconic, and voice acted marvelously.
                Oh man, and Vincent D'Onofrio in the sequel is amazing.
            > just because Keanu was in it   

nobody did that. It was all Witcher 3 hype.
        Oh hell yes. I bet pre-ordering is stopped now too.

...it has stopped, right?
        Yeah of course, pre-ordering cyberpunk dlc right now.

That's pretty much what you said right?
        Wasn't exactly an endorsement as he was literally in the game.
        > .........we did learn that lesson right?

I dunno. What do you think? 😒
        Yeah, they learned that millions of dumbfuck Gamers bought a broken ass piece of shit solely because Keanu Reeves said "You're breathtaking!"
            We bought it because of Witcher 3 - Keanu only added extra hype for it.
                What I learned is be aware of one hit wonders
        Unless it’s Henry Cavill or Tom Felton (similar taste in games)

I don’t care what they play.
            I know Cavill is a big nerd, but does Tom Felton really play games too?
                Yeah. AFAIK he plays a shit ton of RTS’s and simulation games.

Also Taran Killam plays a variety as well.
            Matthew Perry is also a gamer and a huge Fallout fan.
    I have never seen it, but by all accounts it is terrible. However, I have seen the house that it built, and it is terrific.
        Is this Michael Caines quote about the Jaws movie he's in?
            That's exactly what it is.
                And the quote before it is from Krusty the Clown.
            Yep. Jaws: The Revenge
                Ah, Jaws the revenge. Where the ghost of the shark from the first movie comes back and attacks the family of the characters from the first movie. Because what self-respecting shark wouldn't want to seek revenge for its murder by attacking the family members of the people who killed it?
                    It’s not a ghost shark. It’s just a shark. That is somehow implied to be the same shark that was blown up and electrocuted and blown up again.

In all fairness, Jaws The Revenge is only the 2nd worst Jaws film. Jaws 3D is ridiculously boring.
                        An entertaining bad movie is still an entertaining movie. A boring bad movie is just a waste of time.
                            Tarkovsky movies be like
                        Agreed but imo if you had to sit through revenge or 3D, assuming its in the theatre with the glasses, I would watch 3D.  2D there is zero reason to watch it.
                    Is this the Ebert review?
                    I guess now I'm going to have to see this. I watched the first 3 but never got around to seeing Jaws get his revenge.
        Fun fact. Both 'terrible' and 'terrific' both have the same origin and hence are supposed to have the meaning (to inspire fear/terror) but for whatever reason one evolved to mean fantastic
    Oops, I said the quiet part loud and the loud part quiet
        😂
    Oh no! I said the quiet part loud and the loud part quiet...
He said he doesn't play any video games so why would he play this one
    Some actors dont even watch the movies they're in.
        Can’t remember their name but there is/was some English actor who’s never seen a movie they were in because they get didn’t watch TV/movies at all.
            Johnny Depp and Adam Driver are example of actors that don't watch their own movies
                Doesn't Adam Driver have a phobia when it comes to watching him on screen? I remember him walking out of a NPR interview where they were going to show him a clip of one of the movies he was in.
                    What is with people trying shit like that in interviews anyway?
                        That kind of assumes they knew about his phobia though, doesn't it? IMO it's pretty normal to show clips during interviews, in fact it's pretty standard nowadays on talk shows.
                            you may be right, but I have heard before that with interviews there is usually a discussion beforehand of topics and any ground rules. I would suspect if this bothers him this much his agent is sure to mention it when setting up the interview, leading to my suspicion that the interviewer knew and was pushing a boundary, possibly to get a cool story of 'Adam Driver watches one of his movies for the first time' or some shit. Again, I am talking out my ass, but it makes sense to me anyways
                                Yeah I suppose that makes sense
                I don’t personally believe any actor who says that.
                    I don't think it's hard to believe. I still can't listen to recordings of my musical performances, decades after I stopped playing. Some people are just overly critical of their own stuff.
                    They just cringe too much at it.

Many actors, or artists, will tell you there is a deep uncomfortable feeling to see your work at full display.

They see the mistakes, the lines they did not deliver enough, the shot that took 40 takes and still could not make the cut as intended, etc, etc...
            don't get high on your own supply
            Was it Paul aberrant? He said he had never seen any of the marvel movies till he was asked to play vision.

EDIT: Bettany idk what happened there.
                You mean Paul Bettany?
                    Oh my god yeah lol sorry my auto correct must have went crazy.
                        Haha no worries
            I wish I could do that. I don’t get how people can relax while at the same time actively doing something :/
            Bill Nighy doesn't watch the stuff he's in
        Most don’t. They’re just jobs. Fans will always know the lore and references better than the cast.
        Some voice actors seem to forget the vast majority of characters they have voiced.
    People want to believe, they want famous people to like the things they like. And sometimes we forget that this guy is paid to *act* - as in, *he gets paid to pretend to do things*, and says things that are specifically worded to make people believe things that aren't true.

The man never drank a duff in his life
        Henry Cavill is like the opposite tho. Dude is a huge beautiful nerd.
            why he got to be a nerd lol
        Same people think the barmaid is into them.
            She’s not?

But but I went to a Hooter’s once…

    Keanu also said in the same interview he watched other people play it. So he could still have said he loved it. Judging by how Keanu is he probably did. Clickbait title suggests CDPR was lying about Keanu loving it.

Edit: Read the article and if it's true CDPR said Keanu played it, they weren't honest about that. It's a goddamn gossip column though.
        i forgot watching play throughs is a thing. i think it’s becoming fairly common for non gamers to do too. personally i’ve watched probably over 50 hrs of streamers playing tlou2 and might as well say i’ve played that too
            Valid strategy too if you want to play an exclusive, but don't want to get a console just to play one game.
    If I were added in a video game I'd definitely play it lol
        What if you're just not used to playing games. We take the amount of skills required to play the games granted. If you're not adept in playing games already it's hard to pickup that skill very late in someone's life.
    Gamers here want everyone to be be Henry Cavill. These are seriously busy folks people. They don't have couple hours free in a day to deal with additional anxiety
In the same interview he was also told the most request mod was for users to be able to bang his character but CDPR wouldn't let the mod go through. His response was basically: "Let them."

And then he talked about how maybe someone should use the new Unreal engine to make porn.

Watch it here:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OK80eljWrs&t=1010s
    In the same interview he says that the idea of the metaverse is interesting but it's not new and we shouldn't want it to be invented by Facebook. So based.
        And dunks on NFTs. Keanu is one of the genuinely not sociopathic celebrities. Though the Reddit circlejerk around him is a bit much.
            lol, you just blew a load with the group and the post-nut clarity set in, all in one comment.
                so far my favorite comment of all time
                That wasn't my intention but I guess I can see why it seems that way. I think Keanu is a cool dude from what we know about him. But maybe I am wrong and he is a KKK member or something.
                    This is how I feel about basically every half decent celebrity out there.
                Nut*

                I think maybe because its inevitable is why he's saying it, once that meets the apex of cost efficiency and practically being able to do it, there will be no choice for studios.
                    And at the end of the day, why would you care? If it’s gotten to that point, it’ll probably be impossible to tell the difference.
                The movie The Congress explored this possibility. Beautiful and scary af.
                People said this exact stuff about switching to digital capture from film back in the day too, and look where we are now. 

The "mainstream" and majority will slowly move over, and quality will generally be lower for a while as the kinks are worked out and technology improves (see *Rogue One* Peter Cushing and Carrie Fisher, or *The Irishman*), but even once it's the norm there will be throwbacks with real casting and classic cinephiles hiring noteworthy performers (Tarantino, Edgar Wright, Rian Johnson, Ken Brannagh) to do it "for real". We'll also probably get a lot more motion capture and "digital acting" where it still *is* them but their appearance on screen can be entirely disconnected from their own immediate physicality.
                >Id rather see real actors act, not watch cgi.

But that's the thing, what if you couldn't even tell if it's real or CGI? A lot of action scenes in big movies already use full CGI replacements, you don't even know it half the time.
                    [If you can't tell, does it matter?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaahx4hMxmw)
                        There's something oddly unsettling about seeing that woman portray a robot, particularly after she was married to Elon Musk of all people.
                Why is it scary? If its still the actor performing… like they haven’t been using globs of make up and lighting to make actors look younger since the dawn of film.

Also Keanu has already done this in the Matrix and a full CG film called A Scanner Darkly, so this opinion should come as no surprise.
                In reality we’ll probably get to a point in the next 10 years where film crews are capturing motion and spatial data instead of recording light onto celluloid, movies are effectively rendered from 3D into a flat 2D image, and the concept of “CGI actors” will be kind of quaint because everything will technically be “cgi” even if it was shot on a set with real actors.
                > d rather see real actors act, not watch cgi.

I get ya, but what if you could not tell the difference?
                When you won't be able to tell the difference, does it really matter? Obviously we're far from not being able to tell if it's a real person or not, but when we can do that...
            What you don't like r/KeanuBeingAwesome? Super weird subreddit
        Polar opposite of John Cena and other A-listers like him who won’t say a negative word about any potential future ad sponsor. Too afraid to rock the boat to stand up for what’s right.
            Maybe it has something to do that unlike you and I, they have a lot to lose. There are not in position even if they wanted to.
                They lose their job, they’re fine money wise.

You and I lose our job and we might be fucked…
            John Cena is such a wimpy baby that he wouldn’t publicly recognize Taiwan as a country. Fucking wuss told 23.57 million people that he values money over their lives and safety.
        i don't know what "so based" means but he was right.
            Originally it just meant being true to yourself or genuine ([attributed to Lil B the based god](https://youtu.be/prekbB1HOLQ)), but since then it's evolved to mean "this agrees with my personal ideological beliefs" which is why you'll usually see it referred to in a political context. Left wingers will call someone based if they say capitalism is evil, and right wingers will say "based and redpilled" if someone says something racist or misogynistic. In general they're just saying correct.

There's your dose of bizarre meme culture for today :)
            Thats what it means.
    Members Only!! Hahahahaha He’s gonna be bringing back the jackets.
        I think he meant Only Fans but Members Only is funnier.
    Sounds like he's into 3D porn
    This is genuinley the most animated I've ever seen Keanu Reeves, including his digital character in Cyberpunk - and it's when he's talking about die hard coomer shit.

Love it.
    The man is a literal legend.
    😂
    Oh man I just want to listen to Keanu talk about whatever random stuff hes interested in for hours lol.
    He seems like the kind of guy that gets how stuff works, he understands the general idea behind games, the general internet hivemind's existence, but he just doesn't care lol.
This may come as a surprise… but actors who say they love a product often have never even tried the product, much less love it.

I’m sure he “loves it” in a sense that he’s pleased with the narrative, not bc he’s played it

        I was watching a band play at some hole in the wall in Charlotte when one of the band members said "we're glad to finally be playing in this venue, we've heard a lot about it" yeah, I highly doubt that, my guy lmaoo.
        That reminds me of the south park DVDs. I forget what season it was, but they had a skit before each episode to introduce it and they always say "This is our favorite episode"
            They did that through season 1 and some of season 2 (the only ones i own on dvd). Season 2 is mainly "Makin' Bacon with Macon" , but still, every episode is their fave, i love it.
    Hell, look at how many YouTubers took Raid: Shadow Legends money and said good things about it.

People will support almost anything for money. Fuck, I would love for Raid to give me money... That's why anyone works, is for money.
        One youtuber said that Raid Shadow Legends paid him over $10k to promote their game over 5 videos. Seems like a pretty solid deal to me, pretty much pays for your entire streaming setup.
            Yup, I can't blame a person for wanting to eat or invest in themselves.
            That's pretty low honestly, I've heard 10k for one video. It depends on your viewership and tons of other factors like how many videos you put out
        Before I comment.... *\*This response is brought to you by Raid Shadow Legends and Raycon Earbuds. When I'm sitting on the toilet and don't want to reach for the shampoo bottle to read ingredients or I forgot the rest of the internet/my Nintendo Switch/Fire Tablet emulator/anything are a thing, and I want to drown out the noise of my body's defiant outcry against just-cleaned-yesterday-ceramic, I reach for my Raycon Earbuds and play Raid Shadow Legends.

I agree with you.
        Yeah I'd do the same thing but it does hurt your overall credibility. I'm not gonna entertain any recommendation if there's a financial motive behind it.
            Raid Shadow Legends got Jeff Goldblum... Throw some Jeff Goldblum money at me and I'll support Star Fox Zero.
            I mean usually it’s obvious when something is paid promo and in the case of YouTube it clearly has to be stated when something is paid promo
                The best ones are the ones who have fun with the ads. Dunkey, InternetCommentEtiquette, Internet Historian, Channel 8, etc
            When Youtube keeps fucking over content creators and constantly taking away their revenue, they gotta pay bills somehow. Nowadays the creators I watch are honest and clear that certain segments are sponsored ads. I don't mind it.
    Henry Cavill on the other hand...

\*edit\* because this is getting some traction Vin Diesel as well.  Not because he plays D&D, but [Tigon Studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tigon_Studios)...
        Dude spent the pandemic playing all three original Witchers. Even I wont go back to the first one.
            Here he is at Comic-Con actually walking through and explaining what a witcher is:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLZms_s8SEc&t=4m56s
                Lmao the writer saying she had Henry's voice in her head when writing Geralt and the interviewer straight up said "I also often have Henry's voice in my head" hahahaha. I wonder if it makes him uncomfortable? As a man, I never mind being complimented like that, but it also happens so rarely.
                    It gets old, and especially for him I can imagine it gets REALLY fucking old.
                    I also wouldn't mind it for the same reason as you (male, don't get complimented like that too often), but there is a double standard at play here.  Everybody would get very mad if somebody said the same thing to, say, Scarlett Johansson.
                        I am honestly unsure. When I hear women talking about that sort of thing, it's usually because it's *too* often (as in, incessant), very crude (hey hot stuff, wanna sex my sexy sex), or there's an imbalance of power (it's hard for a woman to defend herself against a guy). So Im wondering if Henry Cavill feel any of those things.
            I’m surprised they made a second after the 1st one.
                The 1sr one was the first game by CD Project Red and it had a lot of interesting ideas that people hadn't seen in an RPG at that point. To be sure, no one said it was perfect, or even a classic, but it was a damn good game with a mature storyline, mature gameplay elements, and a mysticism about running around slaying shit with not one, but two swords. I can totally see why they made 2 and 3. Can't wait for the next installment!
                    The original Witcher is what is often described as "Eurojank". Where the game is janky as all hell, and sometimes just garbage to play, but the ideas are so unique and no other game does something like it that it does build a community up around it. 

I think Metro 2033 is an example of a more polished Eurojank game. Stuff like wiping your gas mask off and needing to change if it got damaged, or change the air packs for it manually were unusual mechanics that were interesting. And it had a number of odd mechanics like that, on PC it uses like a dozen buttons more than most shooters because of all the weird stuff in it.
                        STALKER has that same kinda vibe. Shit is weird, has dozens of things to do, your entire keyboard is bound to some function or another.

I could never finish W1 though, I tried hard, I finished W2 like 7 or 8 times and once on the permadeath one.
                            STALKER is just pure Eurojank done perfectly, super deep universe, interesting ideas explored, quite dark and depressing, entire game is a technical marvel held together by elmers glue and ductape that you almost have to fight at times to force it not to die every hour.
                        Witcher 1 was built off of an engine that still used the D&D style rulesets that pretty much all the Bioware games prior to Dragon Age 2 had. That's why the combat was so strange compared to modern games; you weren't clicking a button to swing a sword, you were clicking a button to "cast the spell of swinging a sword".

If you can get passed the outdated graphics, wonky combat and a steep learning curve of a UI then the game itself is quite good.
                        > Where the game is janky as all hell, and sometimes just garbage to play, but the ideas are so unique and no other game does something like it that it does build a community up around it.

That sounds like Two Worlds. It had some great stuff, and some really, really bad stuff.
                    After cyberpunk I don't want another installment.
                The game was eurojank even back then but there weren't really many games like it at the time. The issues were a bit more reasonable back then than vs now so the story was really the big draw and the story was great.
                The eurojank game Dev economy always baffles me, but they managed to escape the "eurojank" title, even with the second game
                    > The eurojank game Dev economy always baffles me..

Why?  
A "genre" (for the lack of a better term) that often has high ambitions and does interesting (and often baffling) decisions because they can is nothing but a positive.  

I'm not surprised at all that they have a lot of customers. Easier to justify buying a 20-40€ game that tries new things and has an interesting idea than 60-80€ for a game that looks nice but plays it suuuper safe.
                    I can only speak for myself but as a lover of eurojank i think the attraction is that they tend to be novel and interesting, they often have weird and interesting mechanics or plots and have a strange earnestness to them as they don't seem to be trying too hard to make money or even be liked. This allows a cult following of weirdo hipsters to form around them, much like hard to listen to bands from genres only 6 people know exist.


Also it's just nice to have a game that feels European, has European sensibilities etc I know a lot of AAA games are made in Europe but they are made for the us market primarily and always seem to be either "America" styled or lacking any cultural identity whatsoever.
                After "That Sword is for monsters" they fucking better have lol

                >What’s there to hate besides the bad framerate?

I could overlook everything and was even getting a feel for the *combat system until I got to that fucking swamp.

Fuck that swamp. I hate it and no one can make me like it.



*once you realize it functions more like an isometric point and click than a more modern third person control scheme it's really not even bad, so if complaints about the combat system have put you off and you're comfortable with iso games give it a whirl sometime
                    It was, at least for me, significantly improved with the Enhanced Edition. The swamp became a lot more tolerable.
                    [deleted]
                        The backtracking, mostly.
                The combat is incredibly janky man.  I didn't hate it, but I'm also pretty forgiving of lackluster combat systems in my RPG's if the other aspects are good.  I can see why it'd be a deal breaker for others.  

It's fairly dated in other ways as well.  Not just the graphics but also like.....collecting prostitute cards and shit...
                    It’s also dated because it’s dated.  It’s from 2007.
        Could be nostalgia but The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay was one of the best games based on a film, at least at the time.
            Just watched the GVMERS video on that. The game was critically praised and in an interview the dev team said that Vin Disel really took his time to nail down the lines and nail the character
        Vin is also staring in Ark 2. He apparently loves playing ark.
            Me too.  After around 800 hours is when I leave my thumbs down review :)
        He almost got passed over for Superman because he was raiding in World of Warcraft when the call came in to offer him the role and he ignored it due to being focused on the game.  Dude absolutely has true gamer cred.

Edit: Apparently it was actually just a congratulatory call from the director, but still, cred earned.
            He was not almost passed over, it was a congratulatory call from Zack Synder telling him he got it.
                "Henry is the best candidate for this role, let's tell him. Oh but if he doesn't pick up our first call, we're picking somebody else."
                Well that story ain't gonna cut it for the Dianes who watch late night tv, MrChangg
                    >Well that story ain't gonna cut it for the Dianes 

Yes, the Dianes...not the giga chads reposting that exact story on reddit
            "You should probably pick up the phone dude."

"Ok fine give me a sec. Alright I'm back, I'm going to become Superman so I have to leave now, see you tomorrow."

"What?"
            Dude also says the only reason he’s so fit is he has to do that so he doesn’t just get fat playing video games all the time
        Or Tom Holland. He said he played spiderman on ps5 and loves the swinging. Also he considers the game version as legit as him or Miles from Into the spiderverse.
            Cavill and Holland were just on Graham Norton's show last week or so.  Norton is a UK talk/chat show and part of what is interesting about the show compared to U.S. talk shows is that the guests spend quite a bit of time on stage together so you get to see how they interact.  

Norton was asking Cavill about his experience filming s2 of The Witcher and also about his interest in WarHammer.  Norton was being a little bit of a dick about it and low-key shaming Cavill for enjoying his hobby, which I found annoying because I feel like for the most part the world has moved beyond trying to make fun of people for that sort of thing.  I typically enjoy Norton but I had to role my eyes a bit at that.

All of that being said, it was a pretty fun interview and it was nice to see Cavill be a sport about it.  I wonder if he ever gets tired of constantly being asked about things like playing WoW or WarHammer and being treated as if they're some crazy thing that he does as if millions of people don't enjoy similar hobbies.

Here's a clip for anyone who's interested in seeing a bit of the interview though.  Holland asking if he can come over to Cavill's home to play WarHammer is the best bit. 

[clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj4vCA2BCqo)
                As someone with 3 kids of different ages I can say with certainty the world has not moved on and many people still shamelessly and continously ridicule and bully people for this stuff. I would say the adult sphere has gotten a bit more tolerant and understanding of "nerd things" since I was a kid but that really depends on what circles you run in.
                    You're probably right.  I guess part of my perception comes from the fact that I do my best not to keep those types of people in my life. Obviously that's easier to do as an adult than it would have been as a child.  

Also, while I've always been into nerdy hobbies like video games, D&D, anime, etc, I'm also pretty socially competent and I don't let my hobbies define me.  I sometimes enjoy talking about them with strangers, but I also recognize when a person isn't interested and I wouldn't try to press the issue.
                Yeah, I hate how people act like nerds are these fucking unicorns.  Meanwhile Joe Manganiello, Tom Morello, The Big Show, Vince Vaughan, etc all play fucking D&D together.

Which is hilarious because they played basic D&D, which is a lot of what my buddy would run.  A lot of these guys are not much different than any of my friend group, just operating at much higher financial level.

Personally I become a bigger fan of them because, while I'm no where close to Henry Cavill, I'm a lot closer to him than I am to some sort of stereotype.

Most of my D&D group is married with children, most of my video game buddies are mostly married with children as well.

I love sharing the experiences of some of the other nerd shit I do, like recently I've really gotten back into racing, and another one of my friends is an F1 fan, he's really pumped for me to receive delivery of my new racing sim setup (shoutout to /r/simracing) so he can decide if he wants to get one as well.

Another friend recently sold all his real firearms and got back into airsoft that he does outdoors and wants me to come along.  I think it'd be great fun to do, so I'll be doing that after the winter...

A lot of people are usually into some unique cool shit that if you just take a weekend to join them you might find something you're also really into.
        That's cuz he's a real one
    Honestly a lot of actors dont even watch their own work
        People are actually like legitimately offended that the vast majority of acting roles are “just jobs” to most actors and that there’s absolutely nothing wrong or unprofessional about that, and it hurts people’s feelings to learn that they aren’t their characters or that they aren’t superfans of the properties they’re in

Parasocial relationships lol

That being said hearing actors and voice actors be massive nerds is always great though
    People here not reading the article smh

>
CD Projekt Red CEO Adam Kiciński said the actor "loves" playing Cyberpunk. He went on to admit that he hadn't completed it yet, but this definitely gave off the impression that Reeves was actively working on his own playthrough, certainly not just watching a demo.
        Yeah this is not the same thing as an actor saying they didn't play some random call of duty game they were in lol. CDPR apparently lied for press coverage or at the very least were extremely misleading.

Now is this a big deal? Not anywhere near as big a deal as all the other shit they've done, but this isn't typical at all.
        So don't trust celebrity endorsement, but also don't trust secondhand celebrity endorsements.

Honestly, the second I'd have thought I could trust. Surely a CEO can't lie about what someone else said in the promotion of a product. That's like libel or something.
    Wait. You mean when actors do the late night circuit promoting a movie that everyone can see definitely sucks they’re only doing that to sell tickets to their movie? What about when they say the working with that cast was like hanging out with family? Surely that can’t also have been a lie?

Shit man I gotta sit down. The world is a darker and more cynical place than I could have possibly imagined.
    People really overestimate how much paid actors care about a product and that it doesnt always correlate with talent/performance. Yuri Lowenthal or whatever his name was, English voice for Sasuke and a million other characters across all forms of media? As of a few years ago I think, someone asked him a question about Naruto, the show thats over 700 episodes, a dozen movies, and spanned nearly 14 years..and Yuri basically replied that he's never watched the series and doesn't really know much about Sasuke.

And there's nothing really wrong with that, it's not inherently required to put on a good performance. 

As for games, actors are kept in the dark sometimes to a astounding degree. Quinton Flynn who voices Raiden in MGS2 and numerous others, one time talked about how script reading was back in the day (15-20 years ago now). Sometimes he would literally just be reading lines in a dark room, and told nothing of the situation or character, anything. He doesnt know if hes voicing somebody young, somebody old, guy, robot, if they're angry, if they're happy, are they somber, etc. To prevent leaks they were sometimes kept in the dark

Actors are usually pretty far removed from their work
    Yeah, check out the behind the scenes video and he does absolutely seem to love it. Love it as in.. You know, being involved in making it, being *in* it, etc.
    Most of the time this isn’t true lol at least when the actor says it themselves
    Next you'll be telling me pro athletes don't drink loads of sugary drinks.
    My favorite instance of this was a tweet that gal gadot's press team did about how much she loves her Huawei phone.

Via Twitter for IPhone.
    Wait... Are you telling me LeBron James and Blake Griffin don't roll around LA and New York in Kias?
    Keanu doesn’t really seem like the guy who sits around playing video games all that much. He’s more likely to go for a joyride on his motorcycle in my mind
    This would always piss me off with superhero movies. The actors would always say, in interviews, how they grew up with the source material and we're really looking forward to doing the character some justice for fans. And then their acting, storyline, and everything else about the movie is atrocious. Ex. Ghost Rider.
    They have contractual obligations to go on press junkets to sell the product. They have to advertise it, whether it’s good, whether they like it personally.
He was probably shown the same 5 min guided area they showed to press folks. Pretty sure the last video game he played was Asteroids.
    >CD Projekt Red CEO Adam Kiciński said the actor "loves" playing Cyberpunk. He went on to admit that he hadn't completed it yet, but this definitely gave off the impression that Reeves was actively working on his own playthrough, certainly not just watching a demo.

They claimed he played it
        He probably played it for 30-60 minutes in a scripted area. the impression that he was working on his own playthrough was an intentional misleading statement to boost sales.
            Or the CEO is just lying.
                The CEO lying? Nah, couldn’t be. It’s not like there’s a track record we can look at here.
                The CEO didn’t say it, the journalist implied that the CEO implied it. It’s all implications lol
                    You KNOW the CEO claimed he did.

Just like he claimed CP2077 was ready to ship, just like he claimed they would fix the game asap.

The CEO only cares about business decisions.
                        I don’t know that because it wasn’t a quote. 

Again, it’s all implications.
        They claimed a lot of things
        Wait, so you’re saying CDPR leadership is… *gasp*… willing to lie to the public!!??
            ...shame...shame...shame...

Remember Kevin Spacey in Call of Duty? lulz
    Of course he didn't play, that game's characters were all way over 18.
        And when they asked if he'd like to go online to play with a bunch of teenage boys, he thought it was a trap.
            They only wanted to scree his mom so he wasn't interested
    That was an awesome campaign and he was a really cool villain when the game came out.. shame.
        Despite the fact that as I grew older I realised he was always a twist villain, I still loved every film and game he was in just because I liked him. Guess he was a twist villain in real life too...
            Art imitates life
    Probably because he was impressed by the way COD annually fucks the kids that play their games
I'm just waiting for the next generation upgrade before I start playing it. I bought it 10$ at Best Buy with a free steel case
    imagine them saying fk everyone and charging for the upgraded version
        I will literally never play it. Would hope they wouldn’t dare after everything.
        They aren't gonna do that.

                I would pay for an RDR2 update though…
            That's almost *exactly* what people said when others were being doubtful about CP77 and how good it would be when rushed out and especially on the older gen consoles.

"They wouldn't release a bad game" and "they wouldn't release an unfinished game" or "they *care* about gamers" and other nonsense.

Especially since they've *only* released unfinished games, W1, W2 and W3 were all rather busted on release and needed a lot of ironing to become proper good.

And now people are doing it again "they would never!".  
A lot of the old guard and the people who made the older games fantastic have left the studio.  
Let's just wait and see what they do, but don't bet on it being some altruistic deed on their part.
                Wtf are you talking about? They’ve confirmed multiple times on financial reports that it’ll be free + they’ve also tweeted about it being free every time it’s mentioned. You’re insane if you think they’ll suddenly just add a price to it for literally no reason seeing as paid DLC will be out next year.
                    Anybody who thinks they're going to pull the bait and switch on this one has finally lost the plot.

>They’ve confirmed multiple times on financial reports

This alone should end the conversation.

And yet... redditors are convinced CDPR is a cartoon villain stealing candy from babies.
    I still intend on playing it too but will be doing the same thing as you, I think they still plan on releasing DLC for it too - I’ll probably wait for the upgrade/DLC release before I jump in.
        I bought it for $10 the other day. Heard it runs good enough on ps5 and I have an itch to play an rpg but on the other hand I want to get the full experience down the line
            Had no problems with performance on series x at launch. My main issue was how shitty the gameplay was, not bugs
                I played and finished it on PS5 without any major issues.

World is dead and boring.

                This exactly. It reminds me of that episode of Rick and Morty where they are stuck in the simulation. Except in CB2077 you are Jerry with the broken subpar simulation. 

Half the enemies I could literally stand still and blow then away with clip after clip.

The balance sucks too. After trying the escape from the tower (early game moment) and being overwhelmed a few times, I just ran straight through the whole thing. Half the enemies just stood still.
    I bought like 10 of them from Best Buy way earlier in the year when they were also $10 so I could get all the Steelbooks. I then went right over to GameStop and traded them in for profit. Well, GameStop would only take one of each console version at a time so I had to do it in several trips, but I got like $20 in store credit for each game.
        [deleted]
            If that's greasy then I'm a Mcdonald's bag
        Thats a lot of work for $20. The gas it took to get to the stores probably cost more than that.
            I made $100 in store credit "profit," Best Buy was across the street from GameStop, and I never went back to GameStop when it wasn't convenient for me i.e. I went shopping nearby. I've since moved and I certainly wouldn't do it now with everything being 10-15 minutes away.
            Have you never driven a car or paid for gas before?
            [deleted]
            It's $200, $40 each trip as they took one for each console. Do it when you're going there for other things or spend a few bucks on fuel....
    I did the same. I played a little, and it's mostly fine on ps5 but I've definitely had some strange glitches
Most actors don’t play the games they are in just like they don’t watch the movies they are in. It’s work, it’s a job, and most have other hobbies. This isn’t any more surprising than Ron Pearlman stating he doesn’t play any of the fallout games of any video games. I find it pretty silly when companies say “X actor loves the game they are in”. Like, come on. Really?
    I work in the games industry and one of my past coworkers (who worked on mass effect 1-3) told me that they have never played the series, and do not want to play any game they work on.
        Very much true. I work in IT and as much as I love technology I hardly ever want to look at that stuff outside of work.
            I use excel at work. I love it so much I use it on the weekends.
                LPT -- Sounds like you have what it takes to go to the pros! Up your game by getting into [Excel as an esport](https://old.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/comments/rdm91n/top_excel_experts_will_battle_it_out_in_an/)!
                Excel is breathtaking
                Lmaoooo
            I feel the same way as an animator. When I finish a project I'm obviously proud of it but i also never want to see it again
            Yeah, it's a nasty side effect of the saying 'If you do it for love, the money comes anyway': you love doing X, you get paid doing X, you can no longer look at X outside the work.
            Also work in tech and this is usually how I feel too.

That said, I have been pushing my wife to push forward with starting a small business as I'd really like the tool I work on in real life. I've been in tech for like seven years and have never once been able to do that. Curse of b2b I guess.
        for many people, playing something you've worked on will just remind you of all the problems that are still in the game. "ah man we could've fixed that! god damn it that's the wrong texture."
            Or in worse cases, the crunch times.

Imagine an LA Noire worker finding an area that gave him PTSD
            I completely understand that too. Part of why I don’t want to be a game dev, because I’d nitpick everything and I wouldn’t enjoy it. I think that goes for anything you create from music, to art, tattooing, to videogames. I bet drake doesn’t listen to his music once he’s done with it.
                Lady Gaga once said the same sentiment, listening to her own music makes her find all kinds of problems with it.
        Im sure the main people, artists, programmers play the game over and over as they gotta make it work
            many artists in industry don’t play games at all, not just their game
        I think that's a clearer case. If you make The Last of Us, that game isn't going to be as emotionally impactful to you, is it? Because you spent three months staring at one corner of the room and have had it super, super, super spoiled for you.
    Are you trying to tell me Patrick Stewart was *not* an avid Oblivion player?
        He's more of a Morrowind guy.
        He definitely plays a female Orc with all of the sex mods
    >just like they don’t watch the movies they are in.

I'd say that this isn't true. Most actors go to the premiere of their movie and therefore do watch them. They just aren't  "fans".
        In the Friends reunion Jennifer Aniston said she hasn’t watched the later seasons, but they all have watched the earlier seasons.
        It's up to the actor. They attend the premiere, but a lot of them slip out of the movie and go drink backstage or in the green room with their peers.
        Actually a lot of actors go to the premiere, but leave as soon as the movie starts by a back door or something like that
    Pretty sure Norman Reedus/Mads Mikkelson actually played Death Stranding and thought it was awesome.
        sure they did! a promotional interview would NEVER lie about a 60 year old man loving video games!
            They're 52 and 56 respectively.
    I can't remember the actors name, but I wonder if Chandler from friends played Fallout New Vegas.
        You know he did. He actually asked to be in that game because he was a huge fan of fallout 3. He actually developed carpal tunnel from playing it so much and bought 360s and a copy of the game and gave it out to friends. Hell he went in Ellen once and gave her one.
            Haha yeah I should have figured, I forgot about the CT he got from fo3.
    > just like they don’t watch the movies they are in.

That's really not true at all.  Some wont watch a certain movie, but most absolutely will.
    Lance Reddick, the voice behind Commander Zavala plays a titan in Destiny
        Did he play horizon zero dawn though?
        “Most”. Didn’t say all.
        Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold.
        also Nathan Filion was a hunter main i think
        Wasn't he a Warlock main?
    Most actors don’t watch the movie they are in?
        "Most" might have been a bit hyperbolic. "A lot" is probably accurate though. It's pretty common.
            Just about all actors go to the premieres, what happens in those situations? These are serious questions as well because I don't know the process. I know there are actors who don't like watching themselves but haven't really heard of many that haven't seen their own movies.
                They still know the script.
                It's up to the actor. They attend the premiere, but a lot of them slip out of the movie and go drink backstage or in the green room with their peers.
    Henry cavil would like a word
More importantly from the same article:

> In a strange little side note though, he did give his permission for fans to mod the game to have sex with his model, so you win some, you lose some.

I love Keanu
He could love the setting, lore, world, etc. I love Japan, but I've never been there.
    [deleted]
        Yea there's definitely a lot wrong with the country but you knew what I meant lol
I'm sure he TRIED to play it.
Saying he loved it doesn't mean he played it.

You know how many people say they love/hate games just by watching YouTube or Twitch nowadays?
    Saying he played it means he played it, though.
I'm definitely taking Keanu's word over that of CDPR at this point.
Remember how everybody sucked off CDProjekt Red back in the day?
    5 years living living off a really good but overrated title
        I bought the game on sale 3 years ago and only played 30-60 minutes or it, sorry everyone else but i failed to see the hype
    I keep trying to tell people *no company* is *ever* your friend. No matter how "consumer-friendly" they appear outwardly, it is all a tactic for their own benefit. They view good will as a bargaining chip, *fucking currency*, not as an essential part of their business model. They will cash in that good will the first time they think it's convenient. CDPR spent it *all* on Cyberpunk 2077 and realized that no matter how much good will you generate, it will never fucking cover the deficit you generate by shitting all over your loyal fanbase.

There are developers I love, like the guys working on Valheim, but if you think I'm taking my eye off of them or saying shit like "they'll never release the game in an unfinished state and move on" you're fucking high. They seem great now, but when it comes to money, everyone's a greedy piece of shit.
    Yeah I'm glad people are seeing through their bullshit finally
Well…CD Projekt has a reputation now of not being the most honest. So not really surprising. 

That being said Keanu Reeves loving or not loving the game has no effect to me enjoying it. So it’s a bit of a moot point
    Really? I can’t really think about anything CD Projekt has lied about, especially not anything Cyberpunk related. I thought this was a smooth process from beginning to endz
    It was obvious he didn’t play it, no one could.
James Cameron also said he loved Terminator Genysis. If he even watched it who knows but it’s just marketing. 

Granted the “just marketing” is why this game was a shit show so I guess I got myself there.
    Well, he has said the first Resident Evil movie is a guilty pleasure of his
    There’s a time to be a human being and have an opinion, and there’s a time to sell cars -Steven Spielberg
    Admittedly watching a movie is probably a much easier sell to a Hollywood person than playing a game. Even if he didn't like it, there's that unspoken show business rule to always speak positively (or at least charitably) of your past coworkers.
    When Arnold was asked to do Terminator 3 he called James Cameron to get his opinion if he should take it or not and he basically said ask for as much money as he can. 

Sometimes you just take the money because why not, sure you might take a small hit to your reputation but just like Micheal Caine said when he was asked if he's watched JAWS 2:

"No. But I've seen the house it bought for my mum. It's fantastic"
Downvote me to oblivion but I absolutely hated everything about Silverhand. Love Keanu but silverhand was just so cheesy and not in a self aware amusing way. It always felt like he was acting like a 14 year old edge lord. It felt like such a waste of a perfectly good Keanu.
    Agreed.
I know it’s fun to hate on Cyberpunk but I decided to start playing it this weekend and haven’t been able to put it down. It’s so fun. The voice acting and storytelling is fantastic. I made a katana build and I am at the point now where I can slice and dice everyone up. I understand it didn’t live up to the hype and it never was going to but it’s a damn fun game right now.
    > and I am at the point now where I can slice and dice everyone up

So you're what? Level 6? lol

I found the game decentish but it's definitely not as replayable as most people make out. Hope you keep having fun with it.
        If I remember correctly theres an underwater ability and 0 missions etc with pools for said ability
    I agree!
    I'm still waiting on the next gen patch. Can't believe it is taking them this long to deliver on something even small studios have delivered in a few months time. Just shows how botched the development cycle was for the game. Probably spaghetti code everywhere and fixing one shit breaks something else. I really feel they need to move to UE5 and overhaul their development practices so they again don't botch whatever they're working on now after CB2077. Custom Engines should only be used by teams who are adept and know the shortfalls. For everyone else, just move to an industry standard like UE5 or Unity unless you want to become a slow moving mammoth.
    Even if you disregard the hype, the dishonesty, the deception or the extremely buggy launch (or how ps4 and xbone users were fucked over), it's still a terrible mess of a game in many aspects. There is a decent game hiding in there somewhere but it's overshadowed by the incredible amount of immersion breaking stuff. It fails miserably in areas where other games figured out decades ago, like traffic/police/NPC AI, water physics, car physics among many others. Especially the driving: engine sounds are excruciatingly bad and cars handle terribly. It's by far the worse I've ever seen.

They can't even figure out how to make the minimap zoom out when you're driving (so you end up missing turns) or deselect missions. It looks like they were in over their heads and said "fuck it, lets realease the game half baked". Unlike other prematurely released AAAs, CP77 is in such a state that it'll never be truly fixed.
        Why use cars when you can use the motorcycles that go nyoom?
        Sure, but people can still like the game lol

Cd projekt red are lying losers is that relly still a suprise. They lied about dam near evrything about the game
CDPR are liars. What else is new
Lmao cyberpunk was such a mess if he did play it he would’ve had some questions
I'm sure he would've enjoyed playing that hot trash.
    He was blown away…by awful it was.
I love Keanu Reeves but I hate that they spent so much money on a celebrity instead of spending it on the development. This game went from one of my most anticipated games to something I’m going to buy in 2023 sometime at a big discount. Sigh, I still watch the “Personal Responsibility” trailer from time to time.
Well aware of the lies they tell. Still incredibly happy with my refund, and never playing this train wreck.
Not surprised that cd project red lied, its kind of what they do now
Lol
Is CDPR being caught lying really news at this point? I don’t think I’ve ever witnessed a company face plant and destroy their rep so hard in one game.
Cyberpunk haters are so rabid that we're still seeing posts like this get traction. Y'all need to move on.
CD Projekt lied? Impossible, they would never do that!

/s
I mean, I think its completely within the realm of possibility that he played a demo or short segment of an early build during development, but hasn't "played" it in the sense of owning it/spending a significant amount of time with it
When is the ps5 version coming out ?
    2077
        Is that after or before GTA 6?
            After GTA 6, before Elder Scrolls 6
That’s why he loved it!
There needs to be an organization that goes after game companies that lie or screw over gamers. I know theres the better business bureau and other groups but they don't seem interested in video games
He is never played?
Y’all can hate all you want but I had a blast with cyberpunk as a hacker setting everyone on fire and planting viruses in peoples brains causing their heads to short circuit
That lie is the least of their concerns
It's only a contradiction if we take the word of the same people who claim to have finished a game called Cyberpunk and then gave us whatever that was

Most likely they set him down in a room, stuffed the controller in his hand, and let him walk around their tightly controlled streets for a bit. Had some press about it. Then greatly exaggerated it to try to sell their unfinished game
You can love a game’s story and visuals but never play it.
Adam Kiciński lying about something isn't exactly surprising these days.
Do we really believe anything CD Projekt Red says at this point?
you mean they lied to us?! I don't believe it
Oh GEE, CDPR lied up and down about CP? Ya don’t fuckin say
People need to realize that video game producers/publishers are not their friends. They don't care about earning/maintaining your friendship, only in selling you their latest product. If those goals overlap for a while then they'll happily play to their fans, but the end goal is to get your money and you shouldn't delude yourself otherwise.
He might be smarter then you think. Knowing if he answered yes I played he will get asked questions about the game. Sneaky.
CDPR has been lying a lot lately so I believe Keanu
How could he play it? The game still isn't finished?
Cd project red: *lies

Me: shocked Pikachu face
He probably was the biggest mistake of this game.
The acting is boring and could have been done by any rando from the trailer park.
Should have spent the money for more development instead of a big name to market.
I always skip the shit with him because it's just so awful.
CDPR being full of shit. As if thats new
I never believed he played.  everything is bullshit in life.
They probably didn't bother sending him a code.
Waaait...


You're telling me we were _lied_ to, about Cyberpunk?
Well, he didn't miss anything....
Apparently people are Modding Cyberpunk and having sex with his character. 

….We really are the final rung on the evolutionary ladder.
[deleted]
    Still unfinished ffs lmao 🤣
I played the PC version and 100% it. I did enjoy it. I’m waiting for PS5 upgrade now and will buy it on PS5 since the game is also supposed to get big updates around the same tjme
    It took me a moment to realize why there was so much hate for a pretty decent game. Then I saw the subreddit. On my PC I got a few bugs in the game but it rarely crashed for me.
Honestly it is a good game. Not mind blowing but fun and looks great most of the time. I cant wait for the PS5 update.
At this point, if CDPR said the sky was blue, I might challenge it. 

Who would trust anything they say after all this?
I always wanted to go back to this game and try it out, but never did. Too much time has passed with no real work put in to better the game. It seems all they did is take everyone's money and update the game from its horrible launch state. Such a shame.
I got Cyberpunk on ps5 when it was released, apart from crashing occasionally if played more than few hours and yes some obvious bugs here n there, I think it's  brilliant game, loved it and not finished yet as got into Demons Souls. Great game CP imo but I know am in the minority!
    Mine would crash every two hours pretty much on the dot. Not only that the world felt so empty. I would see one car on like every road if even. I might pick it back up eventually but it felt pretty unfinished when I played
    A complete game on purchase should NOT crash  every few hours and considered brilliant imo. 

I literally stopped playing it because it crashed so often on the PS5. 

Blows my mind that’s excused.
        It puts CDPR in even deeper shit.

There's Witcher 3, and on the other end of the scale, Cyberpunk.

So, a very good game, and not such a good game (as a whole). 

I think most of us doubt they will get back to Witcher 3 level any time soon.
    You’re not alone. I played on PC, only ran into one game breaking bug that was fixed with a restart, played the absolute shit out of the game.

Previous gen console players got boned hard and I understand the disappointment, though.
A site desperate for attention with some click bait articles from their asses. Yeah sounds good.
Hard to believe this is the same developers that made Witcher 3.
Whoever believed that Keanu played the entire game and gave honest criticism is about to get a shock when they find out how all celebrity endorsements work.
Okay? It’s marketing what are they going to say ? “Yeah the actor we paid a lot of money for didnt play the game” 
He probably enjoyed making it and he said he saw stuff and enjoyed it. Such a weird article to make
    They should probably not fucking lie lol what the fuck kind of a stupid question is that
        Saying that he liked something does not = to him playing the game. They more than likely showed him specific Silverhands scenes and he enjoyed it.
            They said he was playing his own playthrough. They lied.
            then say that instead?
    Nothing? I mean why lie? Was ANYONE holding out until they knew what Reeves thought about the game?
    >  It’s marketing what are they going to say ? “Yeah the actor we paid a lot of money for didnt play the game”

And what exactly would be wrong with that? There are a shitload of actors that promote products that they don't use themselves. There is nothing weird or strange about that. What is weird though is the fact that CDPR felt the need to lie about this. Keanu apparently doesn't even play video games. Just more lies from this company.
    [deleted]
Wait the same person who reported him saying he played it and loves it, is the same one reporting that it now wasn't true. 

Easier than a retraction I guess...
    They could only go off the information they had, which was from CDPR. What is there to retract? They reported a quote from CDPR and now they’re reporting that statement wasn’t correct. What the fuck do people want from niche news sites ? Journalists can’t win for losing. Get a grip.
As much as I like Keanu I dont understand why they added him to the game if he has no passion for it.
    He’s an actor. It’s just a job to him. Lots of other actors have been in games they have no passion for, too
    Marketing.
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KlxInHeH5Q
    He can have passion for the story and characters without playing the game.
I’m sure they showed him gameplay…. They are making it sound worst than it is
I don't believe CD Projekt Red has ever played Cyberpunk.
Wow cd project loves lying don't they.
CDPR even lied about Keanu playing the game? Jesus, what didn’t they lie about?
Well, what's important is that gamers learn a valuable lesson about the nature of celebrity endorsements and sponsored content.

...

......

.........we did learn that lesson right?
    That Keanu thought it was the biggest compliment people modding the game to have sex with his character. That was the lesson I learned.
        [deleted]
            The recent interview he did with Carrie-Anne Moss he laughed about it and said it was a compliment while Carrie stated that she would hate it if it was a character based on her.
                [deleted]
                    Yeah, I'd even say keannus feelings are probably a little more complicated than the interview suggests. He spoke sarcastically a few times in the interview and with his inflection it's pretty hard to tell the difference.
                        > with his inflection it's pretty hard to tell the difference

Gen X for the win. We don't even know when we're being sarcastic
                            You're so right. There i go doing it again! Naw I'm just "fucking around"
                            This made me spit out of coffee, no joke..

..but im on the toilet, and I'm not drinking coffee.
                            Isn’t he technically a boomer?
                                Wikipedia defines Gen X as born '65-'80. He was born Sept '64. 

He is undeniably a Gen X icon, becoming famous during the early 90s. Hell, he was even in a rock band in the 90s.
                    I think that both their reactions (Keanu being stoked and Carrie-Anne being offput) are both completely reasonable.

                [deleted]
                    That would be CDPR.

It's for legal reasons because it involves the physical likeness of a person, even with Keanu's apparently carefree endorsement of the practice I 1000% understand where they're coming from.
                        Yep they basically just said that we want to be able to book people without having to have them worry about them being forced into sex scenes


Reasonable really
                        Once you say it's okay for Modders to make graphic sex scenes with your celebrity endorsement lookalikes models good luck getting other celebrity endorsements
                        Especially after what happened with ~~Ellen~~ Elliot Page in that one game.
                            Ootl?
                                Beyond: two souls. Hackers/modders managed to find the full video picture in the game files or something and added a mod so during a shower scene you could see her (at the time) nude.
                            I forgot all about the Ellen page hack. Still kind of weird that Quantic Dream rendered a nude model for her in-game. Seemed a little unnecessary
                                It was David Cage specifically, dude is a grade A creep and I wouldn't be surprised if it came out that he was another sex pervert.
                                BTW, his name's Elliot
                    Yeah fuck the guys telling weird stupid losers to not make mods to fuck a celebrity in their mediocre shitfest game.
                        Idk, I doubt they’re stupid if they’re making these mods. Just weird losers, not weird stupid losers loool
            https://v.redd.it/2ym2wsjgjp481

Double Fist Pump when he finds out it was "him" that was the most requested.
        I'm modding Keanu with big dicks and big ass
    You know what, Reeves' involvement almost certainly was the reason I bought the game, *pre-ordered* the game, I'm not usually one to do such things.

That and the Witcher studio being involved I suppose.

Now your comment made me realise that advertising does work because without Keanu I def wouldn't have been so interested and I didn't even realise that until now.

So thanks for opening my eyes, Advertising doesn't work on me was a little ego trip I used to have. Not anymore.
        Advertising works especially well on people who think they’re immune to it because those people truly believe their wants and desires are organic.
        Glad to hear it, sorry you had to learn the hard way.  I learned the hard way with No Man's Sky myself.  How susceptible I was to the hype market.

Not anymore.  No more preorders, never on launch.  Between price drops and patches, someone on r/patientgamers told me something that's stuck with me ever since: 

"When you buy a game at launch, you're pay the highest price for the worst version of the game."
            New World sends its regards.
                Fallout 76, Battlefield 2042, Halo Infinite etc. etc. Not as bad as No Man's Sky but pretty bad. That was where I learned my lesson but I didn't even buy NMS. Just watched everyone else get upset after they wasted their money and decided I would never preorder.

I was happy pre-ordering these games, and did not regret. Just be careful i guess when a games has a hype train going strong.
        Tbh he was a much much bigger part of the game then I thought he was going to be, he’s basically the main and best character in the game.
        I played cyberpunk for the first time a few weeks ago when I bought it on sale on a whim. It’s actually pretty fun. But it still feels kinda half finished. The sex scenes are terrible, the “shards” are way too many and annoying. Vehicle driving which is a huge part of the game is terrible.

And it’s really buggy, like random floating text, crashes, audio problems, visual glitches. And this is on a pc with a 3090. 

But it was better than I was expecting, and Keanu reeves was the best part
        When they introduced him for the first time in the game quite a lot of ppl went crazy over it... and I could not understand why. Ok, CD Red hired a well known actor but would that mean the game had good code or a well written story ?
    It made zero sense to me that people were ready to declare the game the must play game of the year just because Keanu was in it, like celebrities in games have ever made the game undeniably better
        Im pretty sure the hype for this game was huge well before all of the keanu publicity
            True, very true. That first trailer (2013 I think) was basically just a still image and people were way too excited for it.
                I remember exactly what I thought and even how I felt when I first learned of CP2077.  I wasn't so much excited about the game itself but more about the fact that CDPR was doing it and that basically guaranteed something amazing.  For my part, I loathe this game and I refused to jump on the hate bandwagon at first but seriously, this game is categorically a pile of shit.  It's unfixable.  It's unpatcheable.  Just needs to be remade completely or abandoned.  Off topic, I know.
                    Their first mistake in a world of extreme (or supposed to be extreme) body modifications was to make it first person. Can’t see my clothes, or anything that makes my character unique.
                        but hey what about that *one* functioning mirror
                        Yeah that's why I never considered buying it even before people were upset. As soon as I saw 1st person I wasn't interested anymore
                            I still don’t understand the choice. Game would have been amazing even in its broken state with that.
                    >more about the fact that CDPR was doing it and that basically guaranteed something amazing.

What? Your talking about CDPR right? The Witcher 1 & 2 were mediocre and TW3 was a buggy broken mess at launch. CDPR was having news about crunch and lead devs leaving for years after TW3 launch and before CP2077.

Why the hell did you think that CDPR making it would mean it would be good. That's like believing that a Bioware game now means that it would be good.

                            What? Witcher 2 was huge, which is why there was a ton of hype for 3. I was watching gaming YouTube around that time so I saw it for myself
                            It sold 1.7 million copies in the first week...
                    I thoroughly enjoyed the game  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
                    I agree man. I managed to buy a ps5 this spring and I still haven’t bothered to try cyber punk on next gen. The game was just plain bad and missing lots of content that CD promised us beforehand, but quietly ignored once the focus became more the bug filled glitchy game
            From what I read it was turning out to be a great game before Keanu got onboard.  The execs had the devs change up the story and leave out parts of the game to accommodate the new main character.
                [deleted]
                    I don't think it's really fair to say he was part of thr problem, I doubt he demanded that he be put in way more of the game. My guy hasn't even played it so I don't think he really gives a shit about video games or having a prominent role in one.

Somehow, somebody got a hold of his agent and pitched the idea, Keanu went yeah alright that might be kinda fun and they're paying me a lot, and CDPR made the decision to change everything around him.
                        I don't think these guys are saying Keanu set out to ruin the game like it's his fault. They are saying simply including him so late in the process caused the development schedule to fail.
                I'd say it's more accurate to frame it as "It was turning out to be a great game before CDPR went public and the execs decided to recruit a celebrity name for mass appeal to appease investors while" still fitting the cyberpunk feel""

That said, I can't go wrong with Keanu Reeves.
        Willem Dafoe in Beyond Two Souls?
            He’s in that?
        The plethora of famous actors doing the voices in GTA: Vice City definitely made the game better (for me).
        For me, the reveal was exciting because I thought Keanu Reeves had that unique vibe to him that suited the sort of folk hero rocker that is Johnny Silverhand.

Otherwise, yeah it’s a case by case basis for me. Heck, in some cases, the celebrity made the game worse, like Matthew Perry in New Vegas or Mena Suvari in Kingdom Hearts.

And then you have Tim Curry in Red Alert 3 and he automatically elevates everything with the amount of ham on display.
            Matthew Perry's deliveries are pretty iconic. I'm not saying the guy was acting his heart out or anything and a lot of it rests on the strength of the writing but Benny's a memorable character and he added to that.
            While I understand your point and your example is valid, I liked Matthew Perry in New Vegas, I suspect a reasonable percentage of players do.
            Perry was spot on as a sleazy 50s gambler / mobster. And he was an actual fan of the game, as opposed to Keanu.

*'I hit what I was aiming for. Guess you had brains to spare'*
            I've heard almost nothing but positive reception about Matthew Perry as Bennie..
            There's a good chance Keanu being in the game fucked it. Scuttlebutt is the game was supposed to have a whole different story and do more with the lifepaths but a lot of stuff got binned or hurriedly repurposed to serve the Johnny Silverhand storyline.
                My head cannon with no absolute basis in reality is that Keanu reeves would cameo as Johnny silverhand in one of their many quests and when they found out they couldn't deliver such a large scoped game they scaled it down and turned his cameo into the whole story of the game.
                Too many fundamental features were left in a state of "that'll do" for me to really believe this. I'd say bringing Keanu on in such a large role is just another symptom of the problem.
            Whoa whoa whoa! Matt Perry was a damn good Benny! Let’s keep it in the groove, okay my man? Smooth moves, like smooth little babies.
            You take that back, perry in new vegas was pretty great!
        You could say the same of films. Some films he's done have been nigh unwatchable. Doesn't meant you can't be happy he's in it.
        It's not unreasonable to be excited about something, because your favorite actor is in it
            he is overrated as fuck, especially on reddit
        Brutal Legend. Just wouldn't be the same.
        It was the must play game because it was going to be The Witcher 3 in a futuristic setting. Keanu being in the game was just a nice little cherry on top.
        That Russian therapist definitely made until dawn better. Although he's not exactly the most famous actor out there.
            John Abruzzi shoutout.
        Play Dishonored. Mike Madsen, Brad Dourif, Susan Sarandon, to name a few. Game is fucking iconic, and voice acted marvelously.
            Oh man, and Vincent D'Onofrio in the sequel is amazing.
        > just because Keanu was in it   

nobody did that. It was all Witcher 3 hype.
    Oh hell yes. I bet pre-ordering is stopped now too.

...it has stopped, right?
    Yeah of course, pre-ordering cyberpunk dlc right now.

That's pretty much what you said right?
    Wasn't exactly an endorsement as he was literally in the game.
    > .........we did learn that lesson right?

I dunno. What do you think? 😒
    Yeah, they learned that millions of dumbfuck Gamers bought a broken ass piece of shit solely because Keanu Reeves said "You're breathtaking!"
        We bought it because of Witcher 3 - Keanu only added extra hype for it.
            What I learned is be aware of one hit wonders
    Unless it’s Henry Cavill or Tom Felton (similar taste in games)

I don’t care what they play.
        I know Cavill is a big nerd, but does Tom Felton really play games too?
            Yeah. AFAIK he plays a shit ton of RTS’s and simulation games.

Also Taran Killam plays a variety as well.
        Matthew Perry is also a gamer and a huge Fallout fan.
I have never seen it, but by all accounts it is terrible. However, I have seen the house that it built, and it is terrific.
    Is this Michael Caines quote about the Jaws movie he's in?
        That's exactly what it is.
            And the quote before it is from Krusty the Clown.
        Yep. Jaws: The Revenge
            Ah, Jaws the revenge. Where the ghost of the shark from the first movie comes back and attacks the family of the characters from the first movie. Because what self-respecting shark wouldn't want to seek revenge for its murder by attacking the family members of the people who killed it?
                It’s not a ghost shark. It’s just a shark. That is somehow implied to be the same shark that was blown up and electrocuted and blown up again.

In all fairness, Jaws The Revenge is only the 2nd worst Jaws film. Jaws 3D is ridiculously boring.
                    An entertaining bad movie is still an entertaining movie. A boring bad movie is just a waste of time.
                        Tarkovsky movies be like
                    Agreed but imo if you had to sit through revenge or 3D, assuming its in the theatre with the glasses, I would watch 3D.  2D there is zero reason to watch it.
                Is this the Ebert review?
                I guess now I'm going to have to see this. I watched the first 3 but never got around to seeing Jaws get his revenge.
    Fun fact. Both 'terrible' and 'terrific' both have the same origin and hence are supposed to have the meaning (to inspire fear/terror) but for whatever reason one evolved to mean fantastic
Oops, I said the quiet part loud and the loud part quiet
    😂
Oh no! I said the quiet part loud and the loud part quiet...
Some actors dont even watch the movies they're in.
    Can’t remember their name but there is/was some English actor who’s never seen a movie they were in because they get didn’t watch TV/movies at all.
        Johnny Depp and Adam Driver are example of actors that don't watch their own movies
            Doesn't Adam Driver have a phobia when it comes to watching him on screen? I remember him walking out of a NPR interview where they were going to show him a clip of one of the movies he was in.
                What is with people trying shit like that in interviews anyway?
                    That kind of assumes they knew about his phobia though, doesn't it? IMO it's pretty normal to show clips during interviews, in fact it's pretty standard nowadays on talk shows.
                        you may be right, but I have heard before that with interviews there is usually a discussion beforehand of topics and any ground rules. I would suspect if this bothers him this much his agent is sure to mention it when setting up the interview, leading to my suspicion that the interviewer knew and was pushing a boundary, possibly to get a cool story of 'Adam Driver watches one of his movies for the first time' or some shit. Again, I am talking out my ass, but it makes sense to me anyways
                            Yeah I suppose that makes sense
            I don’t personally believe any actor who says that.
                I don't think it's hard to believe. I still can't listen to recordings of my musical performances, decades after I stopped playing. Some people are just overly critical of their own stuff.
                They just cringe too much at it.

Many actors, or artists, will tell you there is a deep uncomfortable feeling to see your work at full display.

They see the mistakes, the lines they did not deliver enough, the shot that took 40 takes and still could not make the cut as intended, etc, etc...
        don't get high on your own supply
        Was it Paul aberrant? He said he had never seen any of the marvel movies till he was asked to play vision.

EDIT: Bettany idk what happened there.
            You mean Paul Bettany?
                Oh my god yeah lol sorry my auto correct must have went crazy.
                    Haha no worries
        I wish I could do that. I don’t get how people can relax while at the same time actively doing something :/
        Bill Nighy doesn't watch the stuff he's in
    Most don’t. They’re just jobs. Fans will always know the lore and references better than the cast.
    Some voice actors seem to forget the vast majority of characters they have voiced.
People want to believe, they want famous people to like the things they like. And sometimes we forget that this guy is paid to *act* - as in, *he gets paid to pretend to do things*, and says things that are specifically worded to make people believe things that aren't true.

    r/suckingKeanuOff
Keanu also said in the same interview he watched other people play it. So he could still have said he loved it. Judging by how Keanu is he probably did. Clickbait title suggests CDPR was lying about Keanu loving it.

Edit: Read the article and if it's true CDPR said Keanu played it, they weren't honest about that. It's a goddamn gossip column though.
    i forgot watching play throughs is a thing. i think it’s becoming fairly common for non gamers to do too. personally i’ve watched probably over 50 hrs of streamers playing tlou2 and might as well say i’ve played that too
        Valid strategy too if you want to play an exclusive, but don't want to get a console just to play one game.
If I were added in a video game I'd definitely play it lol
    What if you're just not used to playing games. We take the amount of skills required to play the games granted. If you're not adept in playing games already it's hard to pickup that skill very late in someone's life.
Gamers here want everyone to be be Henry Cavill. These are seriously busy folks people. They don't have couple hours free in a day to deal with additional anxiety
In the same interview he says that the idea of the metaverse is interesting but it's not new and we shouldn't want it to be invented by Facebook. So based.
    And dunks on NFTs. Keanu is one of the genuinely not sociopathic celebrities. Though the Reddit circlejerk around him is a bit much.
        lol, you just blew a load with the group and the post-nut clarity set in, all in one comment.
            so far my favorite comment of all time
            That wasn't my intention but I guess I can see why it seems that way. I think Keanu is a cool dude from what we know about him. But maybe I am wrong and he is a KKK member or something.
                This is how I feel about basically every half decent celebrity out there.

            I think maybe because its inevitable is why he's saying it, once that meets the apex of cost efficiency and practically being able to do it, there will be no choice for studios.
                And at the end of the day, why would you care? If it’s gotten to that point, it’ll probably be impossible to tell the difference.
            The movie The Congress explored this possibility. Beautiful and scary af.
            People said this exact stuff about switching to digital capture from film back in the day too, and look where we are now. 

The "mainstream" and majority will slowly move over, and quality will generally be lower for a while as the kinks are worked out and technology improves (see *Rogue One* Peter Cushing and Carrie Fisher, or *The Irishman*), but even once it's the norm there will be throwbacks with real casting and classic cinephiles hiring noteworthy performers (Tarantino, Edgar Wright, Rian Johnson, Ken Brannagh) to do it "for real". We'll also probably get a lot more motion capture and "digital acting" where it still *is* them but their appearance on screen can be entirely disconnected from their own immediate physicality.
            >Id rather see real actors act, not watch cgi.

But that's the thing, what if you couldn't even tell if it's real or CGI? A lot of action scenes in big movies already use full CGI replacements, you don't even know it half the time.
                [If you can't tell, does it matter?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaahx4hMxmw)
                    There's something oddly unsettling about seeing that woman portray a robot, particularly after she was married to Elon Musk of all people.
            Why is it scary? If its still the actor performing… like they haven’t been using globs of make up and lighting to make actors look younger since the dawn of film.

Also Keanu has already done this in the Matrix and a full CG film called A Scanner Darkly, so this opinion should come as no surprise.
            In reality we’ll probably get to a point in the next 10 years where film crews are capturing motion and spatial data instead of recording light onto celluloid, movies are effectively rendered from 3D into a flat 2D image, and the concept of “CGI actors” will be kind of quaint because everything will technically be “cgi” even if it was shot on a set with real actors.
            > d rather see real actors act, not watch cgi.

I get ya, but what if you could not tell the difference?
            When you won't be able to tell the difference, does it really matter? Obviously we're far from not being able to tell if it's a real person or not, but when we can do that...
        What you don't like r/KeanuBeingAwesome? Super weird subreddit
    Polar opposite of John Cena and other A-listers like him who won’t say a negative word about any potential future ad sponsor. Too afraid to rock the boat to stand up for what’s right.
        Maybe it has something to do that unlike you and I, they have a lot to lose. There are not in position even if they wanted to.
            They lose their job, they’re fine money wise.

You and I lose our job and we might be fucked…
        John Cena is such a wimpy baby that he wouldn’t publicly recognize Taiwan as a country. Fucking wuss told 23.57 million people that he values money over their lives and safety.
    i don't know what "so based" means but he was right.
        Originally it just meant being true to yourself or genuine ([attributed to Lil B the based god](https://youtu.be/prekbB1HOLQ)), but since then it's evolved to mean "this agrees with my personal ideological beliefs" which is why you'll usually see it referred to in a political context. Left wingers will call someone based if they say capitalism is evil, and right wingers will say "based and redpilled" if someone says something racist or misogynistic. In general they're just saying correct.

There's your dose of bizarre meme culture for today :)
        Thats what it means.
Members Only!! Hahahahaha He’s gonna be bringing back the jackets.
    I think he meant Only Fans but Members Only is funnier.
Sounds like he's into 3D porn
This is genuinley the most animated I've ever seen Keanu Reeves, including his digital character in Cyberpunk - and it's when he's talking about die hard coomer shit.

Love it.
The man is a literal legend.
😂
Oh man I just want to listen to Keanu talk about whatever random stuff hes interested in for hours lol.
He seems like the kind of guy that gets how stuff works, he understands the general idea behind games, the general internet hivemind's existence, but he just doesn't care lol.

    That reminds me of the south park DVDs. I forget what season it was, but they had a skit before each episode to introduce it and they always say "This is our favorite episode"
        They did that through season 1 and some of season 2 (the only ones i own on dvd). Season 2 is mainly "Makin' Bacon with Macon" , but still, every episode is their fave, i love it.
Hell, look at how many YouTubers took Raid: Shadow Legends money and said good things about it.

People will support almost anything for money. Fuck, I would love for Raid to give me money... That's why anyone works, is for money.
    One youtuber said that Raid Shadow Legends paid him over $10k to promote their game over 5 videos. Seems like a pretty solid deal to me, pretty much pays for your entire streaming setup.
        Yup, I can't blame a person for wanting to eat or invest in themselves.
        That's pretty low honestly, I've heard 10k for one video. It depends on your viewership and tons of other factors like how many videos you put out

    Yeah I'd do the same thing but it does hurt your overall credibility. I'm not gonna entertain any recommendation if there's a financial motive behind it.

        When Youtube keeps fucking over content creators and constantly taking away their revenue, they gotta pay bills somehow. Nowadays the creators I watch are honest and clear that certain segments are sponsored ads. I don't mind it.
Henry Cavill on the other hand...

    Dude spent the pandemic playing all three original Witchers. Even I wont go back to the first one.

            Lmao the writer saying she had Henry's voice in her head when writing Geralt and the interviewer straight up said "I also often have Henry's voice in my head" hahahaha. I wonder if it makes him uncomfortable? As a man, I never mind being complimented like that, but it also happens so rarely.
                It gets old, and especially for him I can imagine it gets REALLY fucking old.
                I also wouldn't mind it for the same reason as you (male, don't get complimented like that too often), but there is a double standard at play here.  Everybody would get very mad if somebody said the same thing to, say, Scarlett Johansson.
                    I am honestly unsure. When I hear women talking about that sort of thing, it's usually because it's *too* often (as in, incessant), very crude (hey hot stuff, wanna sex my sexy sex), or there's an imbalance of power (it's hard for a woman to defend herself against a guy). So Im wondering if Henry Cavill feel any of those things.
        I’m surprised they made a second after the 1st one.
            The 1sr one was the first game by CD Project Red and it had a lot of interesting ideas that people hadn't seen in an RPG at that point. To be sure, no one said it was perfect, or even a classic, but it was a damn good game with a mature storyline, mature gameplay elements, and a mysticism about running around slaying shit with not one, but two swords. I can totally see why they made 2 and 3. Can't wait for the next installment!
                The original Witcher is what is often described as "Eurojank". Where the game is janky as all hell, and sometimes just garbage to play, but the ideas are so unique and no other game does something like it that it does build a community up around it. 

I think Metro 2033 is an example of a more polished Eurojank game. Stuff like wiping your gas mask off and needing to change if it got damaged, or change the air packs for it manually were unusual mechanics that were interesting. And it had a number of odd mechanics like that, on PC it uses like a dozen buttons more than most shooters because of all the weird stuff in it.
                    STALKER has that same kinda vibe. Shit is weird, has dozens of things to do, your entire keyboard is bound to some function or another.

I could never finish W1 though, I tried hard, I finished W2 like 7 or 8 times and once on the permadeath one.
                        STALKER is just pure Eurojank done perfectly, super deep universe, interesting ideas explored, quite dark and depressing, entire game is a technical marvel held together by elmers glue and ductape that you almost have to fight at times to force it not to die every hour.
                    Witcher 1 was built off of an engine that still used the D&D style rulesets that pretty much all the Bioware games prior to Dragon Age 2 had. That's why the combat was so strange compared to modern games; you weren't clicking a button to swing a sword, you were clicking a button to "cast the spell of swinging a sword".

If you can get passed the outdated graphics, wonky combat and a steep learning curve of a UI then the game itself is quite good.
                    > Where the game is janky as all hell, and sometimes just garbage to play, but the ideas are so unique and no other game does something like it that it does build a community up around it.

That sounds like Two Worlds. It had some great stuff, and some really, really bad stuff.
                After cyberpunk I don't want another installment.
            The game was eurojank even back then but there weren't really many games like it at the time. The issues were a bit more reasonable back then than vs now so the story was really the big draw and the story was great.
            The eurojank game Dev economy always baffles me, but they managed to escape the "eurojank" title, even with the second game
                > The eurojank game Dev economy always baffles me..

Why?  
A "genre" (for the lack of a better term) that often has high ambitions and does interesting (and often baffling) decisions because they can is nothing but a positive.  

I'm not surprised at all that they have a lot of customers. Easier to justify buying a 20-40€ game that tries new things and has an interesting idea than 60-80€ for a game that looks nice but plays it suuuper safe.
                I can only speak for myself but as a lover of eurojank i think the attraction is that they tend to be novel and interesting, they often have weird and interesting mechanics or plots and have a strange earnestness to them as they don't seem to be trying too hard to make money or even be liked. This allows a cult following of weirdo hipsters to form around them, much like hard to listen to bands from genres only 6 people know exist.


Also it's just nice to have a game that feels European, has European sensibilities etc I know a lot of AAA games are made in Europe but they are made for the us market primarily and always seem to be either "America" styled or lacking any cultural identity whatsoever.
            After "That Sword is for monsters" they fucking better have lol

            >What’s there to hate besides the bad framerate?

I could overlook everything and was even getting a feel for the *combat system until I got to that fucking swamp.

Fuck that swamp. I hate it and no one can make me like it.



*once you realize it functions more like an isometric point and click than a more modern third person control scheme it's really not even bad, so if complaints about the combat system have put you off and you're comfortable with iso games give it a whirl sometime
                It was, at least for me, significantly improved with the Enhanced Edition. The swamp became a lot more tolerable.
                [deleted]
                    The backtracking, mostly.
            The combat is incredibly janky man.  I didn't hate it, but I'm also pretty forgiving of lackluster combat systems in my RPG's if the other aspects are good.  I can see why it'd be a deal breaker for others.  

It's fairly dated in other ways as well.  Not just the graphics but also like.....collecting prostitute cards and shit...
                It’s also dated because it’s dated.  It’s from 2007.
    Could be nostalgia but The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay was one of the best games based on a film, at least at the time.
        Just watched the GVMERS video on that. The game was critically praised and in an interview the dev team said that Vin Disel really took his time to nail down the lines and nail the character
    Vin is also staring in Ark 2. He apparently loves playing ark.
        Me too.  After around 800 hours is when I leave my thumbs down review :)
    He almost got passed over for Superman because he was raiding in World of Warcraft when the call came in to offer him the role and he ignored it due to being focused on the game.  Dude absolutely has true gamer cred.

Edit: Apparently it was actually just a congratulatory call from the director, but still, cred earned.
        He was not almost passed over, it was a congratulatory call from Zack Synder telling him he got it.
            "Henry is the best candidate for this role, let's tell him. Oh but if he doesn't pick up our first call, we're picking somebody else."
            Well that story ain't gonna cut it for the Dianes who watch late night tv, MrChangg
                >Well that story ain't gonna cut it for the Dianes 

Yes, the Dianes...not the giga chads reposting that exact story on reddit
        "You should probably pick up the phone dude."

"Ok fine give me a sec. Alright I'm back, I'm going to become Superman so I have to leave now, see you tomorrow."

"What?"
        Dude also says the only reason he’s so fit is he has to do that so he doesn’t just get fat playing video games all the time
    Or Tom Holland. He said he played spiderman on ps5 and loves the swinging. Also he considers the game version as legit as him or Miles from Into the spiderverse.
        Cavill and Holland were just on Graham Norton's show last week or so.  Norton is a UK talk/chat show and part of what is interesting about the show compared to U.S. talk shows is that the guests spend quite a bit of time on stage together so you get to see how they interact.  

Norton was asking Cavill about his experience filming s2 of The Witcher and also about his interest in WarHammer.  Norton was being a little bit of a dick about it and low-key shaming Cavill for enjoying his hobby, which I found annoying because I feel like for the most part the world has moved beyond trying to make fun of people for that sort of thing.  I typically enjoy Norton but I had to role my eyes a bit at that.

All of that being said, it was a pretty fun interview and it was nice to see Cavill be a sport about it.  I wonder if he ever gets tired of constantly being asked about things like playing WoW or WarHammer and being treated as if they're some crazy thing that he does as if millions of people don't enjoy similar hobbies.

Here's a clip for anyone who's interested in seeing a bit of the interview though.  Holland asking if he can come over to Cavill's home to play WarHammer is the best bit. 

[clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj4vCA2BCqo)
            As someone with 3 kids of different ages I can say with certainty the world has not moved on and many people still shamelessly and continously ridicule and bully people for this stuff. I would say the adult sphere has gotten a bit more tolerant and understanding of "nerd things" since I was a kid but that really depends on what circles you run in.
                You're probably right.  I guess part of my perception comes from the fact that I do my best not to keep those types of people in my life. Obviously that's easier to do as an adult than it would have been as a child.  

Also, while I've always been into nerdy hobbies like video games, D&D, anime, etc, I'm also pretty socially competent and I don't let my hobbies define me.  I sometimes enjoy talking about them with strangers, but I also recognize when a person isn't interested and I wouldn't try to press the issue.
            Yeah, I hate how people act like nerds are these fucking unicorns.  Meanwhile Joe Manganiello, Tom Morello, The Big Show, Vince Vaughan, etc all play fucking D&D together.

Which is hilarious because they played basic D&D, which is a lot of what my buddy would run.  A lot of these guys are not much different than any of my friend group, just operating at much higher financial level.

Personally I become a bigger fan of them because, while I'm no where close to Henry Cavill, I'm a lot closer to him than I am to some sort of stereotype.

Most of my D&D group is married with children, most of my video game buddies are mostly married with children as well.

I love sharing the experiences of some of the other nerd shit I do, like recently I've really gotten back into racing, and another one of my friends is an F1 fan, he's really pumped for me to receive delivery of my new racing sim setup (shoutout to /r/simracing) so he can decide if he wants to get one as well.

Another friend recently sold all his real firearms and got back into airsoft that he does outdoors and wants me to come along.  I think it'd be great fun to do, so I'll be doing that after the winter...

A lot of people are usually into some unique cool shit that if you just take a weekend to join them you might find something you're also really into.
    That's cuz he's a real one
Honestly a lot of actors dont even watch their own work
    People are actually like legitimately offended that the vast majority of acting roles are “just jobs” to most actors and that there’s absolutely nothing wrong or unprofessional about that, and it hurts people’s feelings to learn that they aren’t their characters or that they aren’t superfans of the properties they’re in

Parasocial relationships lol

That being said hearing actors and voice actors be massive nerds is always great though
People here not reading the article smh

>
CD Projekt Red CEO Adam Kiciński said the actor "loves" playing Cyberpunk. He went on to admit that he hadn't completed it yet, but this definitely gave off the impression that Reeves was actively working on his own playthrough, certainly not just watching a demo.
    Yeah this is not the same thing as an actor saying they didn't play some random call of duty game they were in lol. CDPR apparently lied for press coverage or at the very least were extremely misleading.

Now is this a big deal? Not anywhere near as big a deal as all the other shit they've done, but this isn't typical at all.
    So don't trust celebrity endorsement, but also don't trust secondhand celebrity endorsements.

Honestly, the second I'd have thought I could trust. Surely a CEO can't lie about what someone else said in the promotion of a product. That's like libel or something.
Wait. You mean when actors do the late night circuit promoting a movie that everyone can see definitely sucks they’re only doing that to sell tickets to their movie? What about when they say the working with that cast was like hanging out with family? Surely that can’t also have been a lie?

Shit man I gotta sit down. The world is a darker and more cynical place than I could have possibly imagined.
People really overestimate how much paid actors care about a product and that it doesnt always correlate with talent/performance. Yuri Lowenthal or whatever his name was, English voice for Sasuke and a million other characters across all forms of media? As of a few years ago I think, someone asked him a question about Naruto, the show thats over 700 episodes, a dozen movies, and spanned nearly 14 years..and Yuri basically replied that he's never watched the series and doesn't really know much about Sasuke.

And there's nothing really wrong with that, it's not inherently required to put on a good performance. 

As for games, actors are kept in the dark sometimes to a astounding degree. Quinton Flynn who voices Raiden in MGS2 and numerous others, one time talked about how script reading was back in the day (15-20 years ago now). Sometimes he would literally just be reading lines in a dark room, and told nothing of the situation or character, anything. He doesnt know if hes voicing somebody young, somebody old, guy, robot, if they're angry, if they're happy, are they somber, etc. To prevent leaks they were sometimes kept in the dark

Actors are usually pretty far removed from their work
Yeah, check out the behind the scenes video and he does absolutely seem to love it. Love it as in.. You know, being involved in making it, being *in* it, etc.
Most of the time this isn’t true lol at least when the actor says it themselves
Next you'll be telling me pro athletes don't drink loads of sugary drinks.
My favorite instance of this was a tweet that gal gadot's press team did about how much she loves her Huawei phone.

Via Twitter for IPhone.
Wait... Are you telling me LeBron James and Blake Griffin don't roll around LA and New York in Kias?
Keanu doesn’t really seem like the guy who sits around playing video games all that much. He’s more likely to go for a joyride on his motorcycle in my mind
This would always piss me off with superhero movies. The actors would always say, in interviews, how they grew up with the source material and we're really looking forward to doing the character some justice for fans. And then their acting, storyline, and everything else about the movie is atrocious. Ex. Ghost Rider.
They have contractual obligations to go on press junkets to sell the product. They have to advertise it, whether it’s good, whether they like it personally.
>CD Projekt Red CEO Adam Kiciński said the actor "loves" playing Cyberpunk. He went on to admit that he hadn't completed it yet, but this definitely gave off the impression that Reeves was actively working on his own playthrough, certainly not just watching a demo.

They claimed he played it
    He probably played it for 30-60 minutes in a scripted area. the impression that he was working on his own playthrough was an intentional misleading statement to boost sales.
        Or the CEO is just lying.
            The CEO lying? Nah, couldn’t be. It’s not like there’s a track record we can look at here.
            The CEO didn’t say it, the journalist implied that the CEO implied it. It’s all implications lol
                You KNOW the CEO claimed he did.

Just like he claimed CP2077 was ready to ship, just like he claimed they would fix the game asap.

The CEO only cares about business decisions.
                    I don’t know that because it wasn’t a quote. 

Again, it’s all implications.
    They claimed a lot of things
    Wait, so you’re saying CDPR leadership is… *gasp*… willing to lie to the public!!??
        ...shame...shame...shame...
    They claimed it was finished

Of course he didn't play, that game's characters were all way over 18.
    And when they asked if he'd like to go online to play with a bunch of teenage boys, he thought it was a trap.
        They only wanted to scree his mom so he wasn't interested
That was an awesome campaign and he was a really cool villain when the game came out.. shame.
    Despite the fact that as I grew older I realised he was always a twist villain, I still loved every film and game he was in just because I liked him. Guess he was a twist villain in real life too...
        Art imitates life
Probably because he was impressed by the way COD annually fucks the kids that play their games
imagine them saying fk everyone and charging for the upgraded version
    I will literally never play it. Would hope they wouldn’t dare after everything.
    They aren't gonna do that.
        Rockstar games has entered the chat.

            I would pay for an RDR2 update though…
        That's almost *exactly* what people said when others were being doubtful about CP77 and how good it would be when rushed out and especially on the older gen consoles.

"They wouldn't release a bad game" and "they wouldn't release an unfinished game" or "they *care* about gamers" and other nonsense.

Especially since they've *only* released unfinished games, W1, W2 and W3 were all rather busted on release and needed a lot of ironing to become proper good.

And now people are doing it again "they would never!".  
A lot of the old guard and the people who made the older games fantastic have left the studio.  
Let's just wait and see what they do, but don't bet on it being some altruistic deed on their part.
            Wtf are you talking about? They’ve confirmed multiple times on financial reports that it’ll be free + they’ve also tweeted about it being free every time it’s mentioned. You’re insane if you think they’ll suddenly just add a price to it for literally no reason seeing as paid DLC will be out next year.
                Anybody who thinks they're going to pull the bait and switch on this one has finally lost the plot.

>They’ve confirmed multiple times on financial reports

This alone should end the conversation.

And yet... redditors are convinced CDPR is a cartoon villain stealing candy from babies.
I still intend on playing it too but will be doing the same thing as you, I think they still plan on releasing DLC for it too - I’ll probably wait for the upgrade/DLC release before I jump in.
    I bought it for $10 the other day. Heard it runs good enough on ps5 and I have an itch to play an rpg but on the other hand I want to get the full experience down the line
        Had no problems with performance on series x at launch. My main issue was how shitty the gameplay was, not bugs
            I played and finished it on PS5 without any major issues.

World is dead and boring.

            This exactly. It reminds me of that episode of Rick and Morty where they are stuck in the simulation. Except in CB2077 you are Jerry with the broken subpar simulation. 

Half the enemies I could literally stand still and blow then away with clip after clip.

The balance sucks too. After trying the escape from the tower (early game moment) and being overwhelmed a few times, I just ran straight through the whole thing. Half the enemies just stood still.
I bought like 10 of them from Best Buy way earlier in the year when they were also $10 so I could get all the Steelbooks. I then went right over to GameStop and traded them in for profit. Well, GameStop would only take one of each console version at a time so I had to do it in several trips, but I got like $20 in store credit for each game.
    [deleted]
        If that's greasy then I'm a Mcdonald's bag
    Thats a lot of work for $20. The gas it took to get to the stores probably cost more than that.
        I made $100 in store credit "profit," Best Buy was across the street from GameStop, and I never went back to GameStop when it wasn't convenient for me i.e. I went shopping nearby. I've since moved and I certainly wouldn't do it now with everything being 10-15 minutes away.
        Have you never driven a car or paid for gas before?
        [deleted]
        It's $200, $40 each trip as they took one for each console. Do it when you're going there for other things or spend a few bucks on fuel....
I did the same. I played a little, and it's mostly fine on ps5 but I've definitely had some strange glitches
I work in the games industry and one of my past coworkers (who worked on mass effect 1-3) told me that they have never played the series, and do not want to play any game they work on.
    Very much true. I work in IT and as much as I love technology I hardly ever want to look at that stuff outside of work.
        I use excel at work. I love it so much I use it on the weekends.

        I feel the same way as an animator. When I finish a project I'm obviously proud of it but i also never want to see it again
        Yeah, it's a nasty side effect of the saying 'If you do it for love, the money comes anyway': you love doing X, you get paid doing X, you can no longer look at X outside the work.
        Also work in tech and this is usually how I feel too.

That said, I have been pushing my wife to push forward with starting a small business as I'd really like the tool I work on in real life. I've been in tech for like seven years and have never once been able to do that. Curse of b2b I guess.
    for many people, playing something you've worked on will just remind you of all the problems that are still in the game. "ah man we could've fixed that! god damn it that's the wrong texture."
        Or in worse cases, the crunch times.

Imagine an LA Noire worker finding an area that gave him PTSD
        I completely understand that too. Part of why I don’t want to be a game dev, because I’d nitpick everything and I wouldn’t enjoy it. I think that goes for anything you create from music, to art, tattooing, to videogames. I bet drake doesn’t listen to his music once he’s done with it.
            Lady Gaga once said the same sentiment, listening to her own music makes her find all kinds of problems with it.
    Im sure the main people, artists, programmers play the game over and over as they gotta make it work
        many artists in industry don’t play games at all, not just their game
    I think that's a clearer case. If you make The Last of Us, that game isn't going to be as emotionally impactful to you, is it? Because you spent three months staring at one corner of the room and have had it super, super, super spoiled for you.
Are you trying to tell me Patrick Stewart was *not* an avid Oblivion player?
    He's more of a Morrowind guy.

>just like they don’t watch the movies they are in.

I'd say that this isn't true. Most actors go to the premiere of their movie and therefore do watch them. They just aren't  "fans".
    In the Friends reunion Jennifer Aniston said she hasn’t watched the later seasons, but they all have watched the earlier seasons.
    It's up to the actor. They attend the premiere, but a lot of them slip out of the movie and go drink backstage or in the green room with their peers.
    Actually a lot of actors go to the premiere, but leave as soon as the movie starts by a back door or something like that
Pretty sure Norman Reedus/Mads Mikkelson actually played Death Stranding and thought it was awesome.
    sure they did! a promotional interview would NEVER lie about a 60 year old man loving video games!
        They're 52 and 56 respectively.
I can't remember the actors name, but I wonder if Chandler from friends played Fallout New Vegas.
    You know he did. He actually asked to be in that game because he was a huge fan of fallout 3. He actually developed carpal tunnel from playing it so much and bought 360s and a copy of the game and gave it out to friends. Hell he went in Ellen once and gave her one.
        Haha yeah I should have figured, I forgot about the CT he got from fo3.
> just like they don’t watch the movies they are in.

That's really not true at all.  Some wont watch a certain movie, but most absolutely will.
Lance Reddick, the voice behind Commander Zavala plays a titan in Destiny
    Did he play horizon zero dawn though?
    “Most”. Didn’t say all.
    Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold.
    also Nathan Filion was a hunter main i think
    Wasn't he a Warlock main?
Most actors don’t watch the movie they are in?
    "Most" might have been a bit hyperbolic. "A lot" is probably accurate though. It's pretty common.
        Just about all actors go to the premieres, what happens in those situations? These are serious questions as well because I don't know the process. I know there are actors who don't like watching themselves but haven't really heard of many that haven't seen their own movies.
            They still know the script.
            It's up to the actor. They attend the premiere, but a lot of them slip out of the movie and go drink backstage or in the green room with their peers.

    Yea there's definitely a lot wrong with the country but you knew what I meant lol
Saying he played it means he played it, though.
5 years living living off a really good but overrated title
    I bought the game on sale 3 years ago and only played 30-60 minutes or it, sorry everyone else but i failed to see the hype
I keep trying to tell people *no company* is *ever* your friend. No matter how "consumer-friendly" they appear outwardly, it is all a tactic for their own benefit. They view good will as a bargaining chip, *fucking currency*, not as an essential part of their business model. They will cash in that good will the first time they think it's convenient. CDPR spent it *all* on Cyberpunk 2077 and realized that no matter how much good will you generate, it will never fucking cover the deficit you generate by shitting all over your loyal fanbase.

There are developers I love, like the guys working on Valheim, but if you think I'm taking my eye off of them or saying shit like "they'll never release the game in an unfinished state and move on" you're fucking high. They seem great now, but when it comes to money, everyone's a greedy piece of shit.
Yeah I'm glad people are seeing through their bullshit finally
Really? I can’t really think about anything CD Projekt has lied about, especially not anything Cyberpunk related. I thought this was a smooth process from beginning to endz
It was obvious he didn’t play it, no one could.
Well, he has said the first Resident Evil movie is a guilty pleasure of his
There’s a time to be a human being and have an opinion, and there’s a time to sell cars -Steven Spielberg
Admittedly watching a movie is probably a much easier sell to a Hollywood person than playing a game. Even if he didn't like it, there's that unspoken show business rule to always speak positively (or at least charitably) of your past coworkers.
When Arnold was asked to do Terminator 3 he called James Cameron to get his opinion if he should take it or not and he basically said ask for as much money as he can. 

Sometimes you just take the money because why not, sure you might take a small hit to your reputation but just like Micheal Caine said when he was asked if he's watched JAWS 2:

"No. But I've seen the house it bought for my mum. It's fantastic"
Agreed.
> and I am at the point now where I can slice and dice everyone up

So you're what? Level 6? lol

I found the game decentish but it's definitely not as replayable as most people make out. Hope you keep having fun with it.
    If I remember correctly theres an underwater ability and 0 missions etc with pools for said ability
I agree!
I'm still waiting on the next gen patch. Can't believe it is taking them this long to deliver on something even small studios have delivered in a few months time. Just shows how botched the development cycle was for the game. Probably spaghetti code everywhere and fixing one shit breaks something else. I really feel they need to move to UE5 and overhaul their development practices so they again don't botch whatever they're working on now after CB2077. Custom Engines should only be used by teams who are adept and know the shortfalls. For everyone else, just move to an industry standard like UE5 or Unity unless you want to become a slow moving mammoth.
Even if you disregard the hype, the dishonesty, the deception or the extremely buggy launch (or how ps4 and xbone users were fucked over), it's still a terrible mess of a game in many aspects. There is a decent game hiding in there somewhere but it's overshadowed by the incredible amount of immersion breaking stuff. It fails miserably in areas where other games figured out decades ago, like traffic/police/NPC AI, water physics, car physics among many others. Especially the driving: engine sounds are excruciatingly bad and cars handle terribly. It's by far the worse I've ever seen.

They can't even figure out how to make the minimap zoom out when you're driving (so you end up missing turns) or deselect missions. It looks like they were in over their heads and said "fuck it, lets realease the game half baked". Unlike other prematurely released AAAs, CP77 is in such a state that it'll never be truly fixed.
    Why use cars when you can use the motorcycles that go nyoom?
    Sure, but people can still like the game lol

    Is that after or before GTA 6?
        After GTA 6, before Elder Scrolls 6
Still unfinished ffs lmao 🤣
It took me a moment to realize why there was so much hate for a pretty decent game. Then I saw the subreddit. On my PC I got a few bugs in the game but it rarely crashed for me.
Mine would crash every two hours pretty much on the dot. Not only that the world felt so empty. I would see one car on like every road if even. I might pick it back up eventually but it felt pretty unfinished when I played
A complete game on purchase should NOT crash  every few hours and considered brilliant imo. 

I literally stopped playing it because it crashed so often on the PS5. 

Blows my mind that’s excused.
    It puts CDPR in even deeper shit.

There's Witcher 3, and on the other end of the scale, Cyberpunk.

So, a very good game, and not such a good game (as a whole). 

I think most of us doubt they will get back to Witcher 3 level any time soon.
You’re not alone. I played on PC, only ran into one game breaking bug that was fixed with a restart, played the absolute shit out of the game.

Previous gen console players got boned hard and I understand the disappointment, though.
They should probably not fucking lie lol what the fuck kind of a stupid question is that
    Saying that he liked something does not = to him playing the game. They more than likely showed him specific Silverhands scenes and he enjoyed it.
        They said he was playing his own playthrough. They lied.
        then say that instead?
Nothing? I mean why lie? Was ANYONE holding out until they knew what Reeves thought about the game?
>  It’s marketing what are they going to say ? “Yeah the actor we paid a lot of money for didnt play the game”

And what exactly would be wrong with that? There are a shitload of actors that promote products that they don't use themselves. There is nothing weird or strange about that. What is weird though is the fact that CDPR felt the need to lie about this. Keanu apparently doesn't even play video games. Just more lies from this company.
[deleted]
They could only go off the information they had, which was from CDPR. What is there to retract? They reported a quote from CDPR and now they’re reporting that statement wasn’t correct. What the fuck do people want from niche news sites ? Journalists can’t win for losing. Get a grip.
He’s an actor. It’s just a job to him. Lots of other actors have been in games they have no passion for, too
Marketing.

He can have passion for the story and characters without playing the game.
That Keanu thought it was the biggest compliment people modding the game to have sex with his character. That was the lesson I learned.
    [deleted]
        The recent interview he did with Carrie-Anne Moss he laughed about it and said it was a compliment while Carrie stated that she would hate it if it was a character based on her.
            [deleted]
                Yeah, I'd even say keannus feelings are probably a little more complicated than the interview suggests. He spoke sarcastically a few times in the interview and with his inflection it's pretty hard to tell the difference.
                    > with his inflection it's pretty hard to tell the difference

Gen X for the win. We don't even know when we're being sarcastic
                        You're so right. There i go doing it again! Naw I'm just "fucking around"

                            Wikipedia defines Gen X as born '65-'80. He was born Sept '64. 

He is undeniably a Gen X icon, becoming famous during the early 90s. Hell, he was even in a rock band in the 90s.
                I think that both their reactions (Keanu being stoked and Carrie-Anne being offput) are both completely reasonable.

                That would be CDPR.

It's for legal reasons because it involves the physical likeness of a person, even with Keanu's apparently carefree endorsement of the practice I 1000% understand where they're coming from.
                    Yep they basically just said that we want to be able to book people without having to have them worry about them being forced into sex scenes


Reasonable really
                    Once you say it's okay for Modders to make graphic sex scenes with your celebrity endorsement lookalikes models good luck getting other celebrity endorsements
                    Especially after what happened with ~~Ellen~~ Elliot Page in that one game.
                        Ootl?
                            Beyond: two souls. Hackers/modders managed to find the full video picture in the game files or something and added a mod so during a shower scene you could see her (at the time) nude.
                        I forgot all about the Ellen page hack. Still kind of weird that Quantic Dream rendered a nude model for her in-game. Seemed a little unnecessary
                            It was David Cage specifically, dude is a grade A creep and I wouldn't be surprised if it came out that he was another sex pervert.
                            BTW, his name's Elliot
                Yeah fuck the guys telling weird stupid losers to not make mods to fuck a celebrity in their mediocre shitfest game.
                    Idk, I doubt they’re stupid if they’re making these mods. Just weird losers, not weird stupid losers loool

    I'm modding Keanu with big dicks and big ass
You know what, Reeves' involvement almost certainly was the reason I bought the game, *pre-ordered* the game, I'm not usually one to do such things.

That and the Witcher studio being involved I suppose.

Now your comment made me realise that advertising does work because without Keanu I def wouldn't have been so interested and I didn't even realise that until now.

So thanks for opening my eyes, Advertising doesn't work on me was a little ego trip I used to have. Not anymore.
    Advertising works especially well on people who think they’re immune to it because those people truly believe their wants and desires are organic.
    Glad to hear it, sorry you had to learn the hard way.  I learned the hard way with No Man's Sky myself.  How susceptible I was to the hype market.

Not anymore.  No more preorders, never on launch.  Between price drops and patches, someone on r/patientgamers told me something that's stuck with me ever since: 

"When you buy a game at launch, you're pay the highest price for the worst version of the game."
        New World sends its regards.
            Fallout 76, Battlefield 2042, Halo Infinite etc. etc. Not as bad as No Man's Sky but pretty bad. That was where I learned my lesson but I didn't even buy NMS. Just watched everyone else get upset after they wasted their money and decided I would never preorder.
        RDR2

Death Stranding

Hitman 3

&#x200B;

I was happy pre-ordering these games, and did not regret. Just be careful i guess when a games has a hype train going strong.
    Tbh he was a much much bigger part of the game then I thought he was going to be, he’s basically the main and best character in the game.
    I played cyberpunk for the first time a few weeks ago when I bought it on sale on a whim. It’s actually pretty fun. But it still feels kinda half finished. The sex scenes are terrible, the “shards” are way too many and annoying. Vehicle driving which is a huge part of the game is terrible.

And it’s really buggy, like random floating text, crashes, audio problems, visual glitches. And this is on a pc with a 3090. 

But it was better than I was expecting, and Keanu reeves was the best part
    When they introduced him for the first time in the game quite a lot of ppl went crazy over it... and I could not understand why. Ok, CD Red hired a well known actor but would that mean the game had good code or a well written story ?
It made zero sense to me that people were ready to declare the game the must play game of the year just because Keanu was in it, like celebrities in games have ever made the game undeniably better
    Im pretty sure the hype for this game was huge well before all of the keanu publicity
        True, very true. That first trailer (2013 I think) was basically just a still image and people were way too excited for it.
            I remember exactly what I thought and even how I felt when I first learned of CP2077.  I wasn't so much excited about the game itself but more about the fact that CDPR was doing it and that basically guaranteed something amazing.  For my part, I loathe this game and I refused to jump on the hate bandwagon at first but seriously, this game is categorically a pile of shit.  It's unfixable.  It's unpatcheable.  Just needs to be remade completely or abandoned.  Off topic, I know.
                Their first mistake in a world of extreme (or supposed to be extreme) body modifications was to make it first person. Can’t see my clothes, or anything that makes my character unique.
                    but hey what about that *one* functioning mirror
                    Yeah that's why I never considered buying it even before people were upset. As soon as I saw 1st person I wasn't interested anymore
                        I still don’t understand the choice. Game would have been amazing even in its broken state with that.
                >more about the fact that CDPR was doing it and that basically guaranteed something amazing.

What? Your talking about CDPR right? The Witcher 1 & 2 were mediocre and TW3 was a buggy broken mess at launch. CDPR was having news about crunch and lead devs leaving for years after TW3 launch and before CP2077.

Why the hell did you think that CDPR making it would mean it would be good. That's like believing that a Bioware game now means that it would be good.
                    [deleted]
                        What? Witcher 2 was huge, which is why there was a ton of hype for 3. I was watching gaming YouTube around that time so I saw it for myself
                        It sold 1.7 million copies in the first week...
                I thoroughly enjoyed the game  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
                I agree man. I managed to buy a ps5 this spring and I still haven’t bothered to try cyber punk on next gen. The game was just plain bad and missing lots of content that CD promised us beforehand, but quietly ignored once the focus became more the bug filled glitchy game
        From what I read it was turning out to be a great game before Keanu got onboard.  The execs had the devs change up the story and leave out parts of the game to accommodate the new main character.
            [deleted]
                I don't think it's really fair to say he was part of thr problem, I doubt he demanded that he be put in way more of the game. My guy hasn't even played it so I don't think he really gives a shit about video games or having a prominent role in one.

Somehow, somebody got a hold of his agent and pitched the idea, Keanu went yeah alright that might be kinda fun and they're paying me a lot, and CDPR made the decision to change everything around him.
                    I don't think these guys are saying Keanu set out to ruin the game like it's his fault. They are saying simply including him so late in the process caused the development schedule to fail.
            I'd say it's more accurate to frame it as "It was turning out to be a great game before CDPR went public and the execs decided to recruit a celebrity name for mass appeal to appease investors while" still fitting the cyberpunk feel""

That said, I can't go wrong with Keanu Reeves.
    Willem Dafoe in Beyond Two Souls?
        He’s in that?
    The plethora of famous actors doing the voices in GTA: Vice City definitely made the game better (for me).
    For me, the reveal was exciting because I thought Keanu Reeves had that unique vibe to him that suited the sort of folk hero rocker that is Johnny Silverhand.

Otherwise, yeah it’s a case by case basis for me. Heck, in some cases, the celebrity made the game worse, like Matthew Perry in New Vegas or Mena Suvari in Kingdom Hearts.

And then you have Tim Curry in Red Alert 3 and he automatically elevates everything with the amount of ham on display.
        Matthew Perry's deliveries are pretty iconic. I'm not saying the guy was acting his heart out or anything and a lot of it rests on the strength of the writing but Benny's a memorable character and he added to that.
        While I understand your point and your example is valid, I liked Matthew Perry in New Vegas, I suspect a reasonable percentage of players do.
        Perry was spot on as a sleazy 50s gambler / mobster. And he was an actual fan of the game, as opposed to Keanu.

*'I hit what I was aiming for. Guess you had brains to spare'*
        I've heard almost nothing but positive reception about Matthew Perry as Bennie..
        There's a good chance Keanu being in the game fucked it. Scuttlebutt is the game was supposed to have a whole different story and do more with the lifepaths but a lot of stuff got binned or hurriedly repurposed to serve the Johnny Silverhand storyline.
            My head cannon with no absolute basis in reality is that Keanu reeves would cameo as Johnny silverhand in one of their many quests and when they found out they couldn't deliver such a large scoped game they scaled it down and turned his cameo into the whole story of the game.
            Too many fundamental features were left in a state of "that'll do" for me to really believe this. I'd say bringing Keanu on in such a large role is just another symptom of the problem.
        Whoa whoa whoa! Matt Perry was a damn good Benny! Let’s keep it in the groove, okay my man? Smooth moves, like smooth little babies.
        You take that back, perry in new vegas was pretty great!
    You could say the same of films. Some films he's done have been nigh unwatchable. Doesn't meant you can't be happy he's in it.
    It's not unreasonable to be excited about something, because your favorite actor is in it
        he is overrated as fuck, especially on reddit
    Brutal Legend. Just wouldn't be the same.
    It was the must play game because it was going to be The Witcher 3 in a futuristic setting. Keanu being in the game was just a nice little cherry on top.
    That Russian therapist definitely made until dawn better. Although he's not exactly the most famous actor out there.
        John Abruzzi shoutout.
    Play Dishonored. Mike Madsen, Brad Dourif, Susan Sarandon, to name a few. Game is fucking iconic, and voice acted marvelously.
        Oh man, and Vincent D'Onofrio in the sequel is amazing.
    > just because Keanu was in it   

nobody did that. It was all Witcher 3 hype.
Oh hell yes. I bet pre-ordering is stopped now too.

...it has stopped, right?
Yeah of course, pre-ordering cyberpunk dlc right now.

That's pretty much what you said right?
Wasn't exactly an endorsement as he was literally in the game.
> .........we did learn that lesson right?

I dunno. What do you think? 😒
Yeah, they learned that millions of dumbfuck Gamers bought a broken ass piece of shit solely because Keanu Reeves said "You're breathtaking!"
    We bought it because of Witcher 3 - Keanu only added extra hype for it.
        What I learned is be aware of one hit wonders
Unless it’s Henry Cavill or Tom Felton (similar taste in games)

I don’t care what they play.
    I know Cavill is a big nerd, but does Tom Felton really play games too?
        Yeah. AFAIK he plays a shit ton of RTS’s and simulation games.

Also Taran Killam plays a variety as well.
    Matthew Perry is also a gamer and a huge Fallout fan.
Is this Michael Caines quote about the Jaws movie he's in?
    That's exactly what it is.
        And the quote before it is from Krusty the Clown.
    Yep. Jaws: The Revenge
        Ah, Jaws the revenge. Where the ghost of the shark from the first movie comes back and attacks the family of the characters from the first movie. Because what self-respecting shark wouldn't want to seek revenge for its murder by attacking the family members of the people who killed it?
            It’s not a ghost shark. It’s just a shark. That is somehow implied to be the same shark that was blown up and electrocuted and blown up again.

In all fairness, Jaws The Revenge is only the 2nd worst Jaws film. Jaws 3D is ridiculously boring.
                An entertaining bad movie is still an entertaining movie. A boring bad movie is just a waste of time.
                    Tarkovsky movies be like
                Agreed but imo if you had to sit through revenge or 3D, assuming its in the theatre with the glasses, I would watch 3D.  2D there is zero reason to watch it.
            Is this the Ebert review?
            I guess now I'm going to have to see this. I watched the first 3 but never got around to seeing Jaws get his revenge.
Fun fact. Both 'terrible' and 'terrific' both have the same origin and hence are supposed to have the meaning (to inspire fear/terror) but for whatever reason one evolved to mean fantastic
😂
Can’t remember their name but there is/was some English actor who’s never seen a movie they were in because they get didn’t watch TV/movies at all.
    Johnny Depp and Adam Driver are example of actors that don't watch their own movies
        Doesn't Adam Driver have a phobia when it comes to watching him on screen? I remember him walking out of a NPR interview where they were going to show him a clip of one of the movies he was in.
            What is with people trying shit like that in interviews anyway?
                That kind of assumes they knew about his phobia though, doesn't it? IMO it's pretty normal to show clips during interviews, in fact it's pretty standard nowadays on talk shows.
                    you may be right, but I have heard before that with interviews there is usually a discussion beforehand of topics and any ground rules. I would suspect if this bothers him this much his agent is sure to mention it when setting up the interview, leading to my suspicion that the interviewer knew and was pushing a boundary, possibly to get a cool story of 'Adam Driver watches one of his movies for the first time' or some shit. Again, I am talking out my ass, but it makes sense to me anyways
                        Yeah I suppose that makes sense
        I don’t personally believe any actor who says that.
            I don't think it's hard to believe. I still can't listen to recordings of my musical performances, decades after I stopped playing. Some people are just overly critical of their own stuff.
            They just cringe too much at it.

Many actors, or artists, will tell you there is a deep uncomfortable feeling to see your work at full display.

They see the mistakes, the lines they did not deliver enough, the shot that took 40 takes and still could not make the cut as intended, etc, etc...
    don't get high on your own supply
    Was it Paul aberrant? He said he had never seen any of the marvel movies till he was asked to play vision.

EDIT: Bettany idk what happened there.
        You mean Paul Bettany?
            Oh my god yeah lol sorry my auto correct must have went crazy.
                Haha no worries
    I wish I could do that. I don’t get how people can relax while at the same time actively doing something :/
    Bill Nighy doesn't watch the stuff he's in
Most don’t. They’re just jobs. Fans will always know the lore and references better than the cast.
Some voice actors seem to forget the vast majority of characters they have voiced.

    Valid strategy too if you want to play an exclusive, but don't want to get a console just to play one game.
What if you're just not used to playing games. We take the amount of skills required to play the games granted. If you're not adept in playing games already it's hard to pickup that skill very late in someone's life.
And dunks on NFTs. Keanu is one of the genuinely not sociopathic celebrities. Though the Reddit circlejerk around him is a bit much.
    lol, you just blew a load with the group and the post-nut clarity set in, all in one comment.
        so far my favorite comment of all time
        That wasn't my intention but I guess I can see why it seems that way. I think Keanu is a cool dude from what we know about him. But maybe I am wrong and he is a KKK member or something.
            This is how I feel about basically every half decent celebrity out there.

        I think maybe because its inevitable is why he's saying it, once that meets the apex of cost efficiency and practically being able to do it, there will be no choice for studios.
            And at the end of the day, why would you care? If it’s gotten to that point, it’ll probably be impossible to tell the difference.
        The movie The Congress explored this possibility. Beautiful and scary af.
        People said this exact stuff about switching to digital capture from film back in the day too, and look where we are now. 

The "mainstream" and majority will slowly move over, and quality will generally be lower for a while as the kinks are worked out and technology improves (see *Rogue One* Peter Cushing and Carrie Fisher, or *The Irishman*), but even once it's the norm there will be throwbacks with real casting and classic cinephiles hiring noteworthy performers (Tarantino, Edgar Wright, Rian Johnson, Ken Brannagh) to do it "for real". We'll also probably get a lot more motion capture and "digital acting" where it still *is* them but their appearance on screen can be entirely disconnected from their own immediate physicality.
        >Id rather see real actors act, not watch cgi.

But that's the thing, what if you couldn't even tell if it's real or CGI? A lot of action scenes in big movies already use full CGI replacements, you don't even know it half the time.
            [If you can't tell, does it matter?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaahx4hMxmw)
                There's something oddly unsettling about seeing that woman portray a robot, particularly after she was married to Elon Musk of all people.
        Why is it scary? If its still the actor performing… like they haven’t been using globs of make up and lighting to make actors look younger since the dawn of film.

Also Keanu has already done this in the Matrix and a full CG film called A Scanner Darkly, so this opinion should come as no surprise.
        In reality we’ll probably get to a point in the next 10 years where film crews are capturing motion and spatial data instead of recording light onto celluloid, movies are effectively rendered from 3D into a flat 2D image, and the concept of “CGI actors” will be kind of quaint because everything will technically be “cgi” even if it was shot on a set with real actors.
        > d rather see real actors act, not watch cgi.

I get ya, but what if you could not tell the difference?
        When you won't be able to tell the difference, does it really matter? Obviously we're far from not being able to tell if it's a real person or not, but when we can do that...
    What you don't like r/KeanuBeingAwesome? Super weird subreddit
Polar opposite of John Cena and other A-listers like him who won’t say a negative word about any potential future ad sponsor. Too afraid to rock the boat to stand up for what’s right.
    Maybe it has something to do that unlike you and I, they have a lot to lose. There are not in position even if they wanted to.
        They lose their job, they’re fine money wise.

You and I lose our job and we might be fucked…
    John Cena is such a wimpy baby that he wouldn’t publicly recognize Taiwan as a country. Fucking wuss told 23.57 million people that he values money over their lives and safety.
i don't know what "so based" means but he was right.
    Originally it just meant being true to yourself or genuine ([attributed to Lil B the based god](https://youtu.be/prekbB1HOLQ)), but since then it's evolved to mean "this agrees with my personal ideological beliefs" which is why you'll usually see it referred to in a political context. Left wingers will call someone based if they say capitalism is evil, and right wingers will say "based and redpilled" if someone says something racist or misogynistic. In general they're just saying correct.

There's your dose of bizarre meme culture for today :)

Always love that, band announces somthing like: "We are all so glad to be back performing in our favourite city"

And they are playing in Stoke on Trent
    Stoke on a rainy Tuesday night in February is definitely my favorite city. Not everyone can do it and those that can are special
    Birthplace of Slash tbf
        TIL that Slash was born in the potteries.
        Slash is just one of our parents
Hello St Louis!

Uh, that's Springfield, Steven.
    Goodnight sprungfeld, there will be no encore.
I was watching a band play at some hole in the wall in Charlotte when one of the band members said "we're glad to finally be playing in this venue, we've heard a lot about it" yeah, I highly doubt that, my guy lmaoo.
That reminds me of the south park DVDs. I forget what season it was, but they had a skit before each episode to introduce it and they always say "This is our favorite episode"
    They did that through season 1 and some of season 2 (the only ones i own on dvd). Season 2 is mainly "Makin' Bacon with Macon" , but still, every episode is their fave, i love it.
One youtuber said that Raid Shadow Legends paid him over $10k to promote their game over 5 videos. Seems like a pretty solid deal to me, pretty much pays for your entire streaming setup.
    Yup, I can't blame a person for wanting to eat or invest in themselves.
    That's pretty low honestly, I've heard 10k for one video. It depends on your viewership and tons of other factors like how many videos you put out
Before I comment.... *\*This response is brought to you by Raid Shadow Legends and Raycon Earbuds. When I'm sitting on the toilet and don't want to reach for the shampoo bottle to read ingredients or I forgot the rest of the internet/my Nintendo Switch/Fire Tablet emulator/anything are a thing, and I want to drown out the noise of my body's defiant outcry against just-cleaned-yesterday-ceramic, I reach for my Raycon Earbuds and play Raid Shadow Legends. Now with more mat-farms, characters, and lootboxes! Typecode: ASDFJKL; at checkout for 31% off!\** Alright, now back to the comment:

I agree with you.
Yeah I'd do the same thing but it does hurt your overall credibility. I'm not gonna entertain any recommendation if there's a financial motive behind it.
    Raid Shadow Legends got Jeff Goldblum... Throw some Jeff Goldblum money at me and I'll support Star Fox Zero.
    I mean usually it’s obvious when something is paid promo and in the case of YouTube it clearly has to be stated when something is paid promo
        The best ones are the ones who have fun with the ads. Dunkey, InternetCommentEtiquette, Internet Historian, Channel 8, etc
    When Youtube keeps fucking over content creators and constantly taking away their revenue, they gotta pay bills somehow. Nowadays the creators I watch are honest and clear that certain segments are sponsored ads. I don't mind it.
Dude spent the pandemic playing all three original Witchers. Even I wont go back to the first one.
    Here he is at Comic-Con actually walking through and explaining what a witcher is:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLZms_s8SEc&t=4m56s
        Lmao the writer saying she had Henry's voice in her head when writing Geralt and the interviewer straight up said "I also often have Henry's voice in my head" hahahaha. I wonder if it makes him uncomfortable? As a man, I never mind being complimented like that, but it also happens so rarely.
            It gets old, and especially for him I can imagine it gets REALLY fucking old.
            I also wouldn't mind it for the same reason as you (male, don't get complimented like that too often), but there is a double standard at play here.  Everybody would get very mad if somebody said the same thing to, say, Scarlett Johansson.
                I am honestly unsure. When I hear women talking about that sort of thing, it's usually because it's *too* often (as in, incessant), very crude (hey hot stuff, wanna sex my sexy sex), or there's an imbalance of power (it's hard for a woman to defend herself against a guy). So Im wondering if Henry Cavill feel any of those things.
    I’m surprised they made a second after the 1st one.
        The 1sr one was the first game by CD Project Red and it had a lot of interesting ideas that people hadn't seen in an RPG at that point. To be sure, no one said it was perfect, or even a classic, but it was a damn good game with a mature storyline, mature gameplay elements, and a mysticism about running around slaying shit with not one, but two swords. I can totally see why they made 2 and 3. Can't wait for the next installment!
            The original Witcher is what is often described as "Eurojank". Where the game is janky as all hell, and sometimes just garbage to play, but the ideas are so unique and no other game does something like it that it does build a community up around it. 

I think Metro 2033 is an example of a more polished Eurojank game. Stuff like wiping your gas mask off and needing to change if it got damaged, or change the air packs for it manually were unusual mechanics that were interesting. And it had a number of odd mechanics like that, on PC it uses like a dozen buttons more than most shooters because of all the weird stuff in it.
                STALKER has that same kinda vibe. Shit is weird, has dozens of things to do, your entire keyboard is bound to some function or another.

I could never finish W1 though, I tried hard, I finished W2 like 7 or 8 times and once on the permadeath one.
                    STALKER is just pure Eurojank done perfectly, super deep universe, interesting ideas explored, quite dark and depressing, entire game is a technical marvel held together by elmers glue and ductape that you almost have to fight at times to force it not to die every hour.
                Witcher 1 was built off of an engine that still used the D&D style rulesets that pretty much all the Bioware games prior to Dragon Age 2 had. That's why the combat was so strange compared to modern games; you weren't clicking a button to swing a sword, you were clicking a button to "cast the spell of swinging a sword".

If you can get passed the outdated graphics, wonky combat and a steep learning curve of a UI then the game itself is quite good.
                > Where the game is janky as all hell, and sometimes just garbage to play, but the ideas are so unique and no other game does something like it that it does build a community up around it.

That sounds like Two Worlds. It had some great stuff, and some really, really bad stuff.
            After cyberpunk I don't want another installment.
        The game was eurojank even back then but there weren't really many games like it at the time. The issues were a bit more reasonable back then than vs now so the story was really the big draw and the story was great.
        The eurojank game Dev economy always baffles me, but they managed to escape the "eurojank" title, even with the second game
            > The eurojank game Dev economy always baffles me..

Why?  
A "genre" (for the lack of a better term) that often has high ambitions and does interesting (and often baffling) decisions because they can is nothing but a positive.  

I'm not surprised at all that they have a lot of customers. Easier to justify buying a 20-40€ game that tries new things and has an interesting idea than 60-80€ for a game that looks nice but plays it suuuper safe.
            I can only speak for myself but as a lover of eurojank i think the attraction is that they tend to be novel and interesting, they often have weird and interesting mechanics or plots and have a strange earnestness to them as they don't seem to be trying too hard to make money or even be liked. This allows a cult following of weirdo hipsters to form around them, much like hard to listen to bands from genres only 6 people know exist.


Also it's just nice to have a game that feels European, has European sensibilities etc I know a lot of AAA games are made in Europe but they are made for the us market primarily and always seem to be either "America" styled or lacking any cultural identity whatsoever.
        After "That Sword is for monsters" they fucking better have lol

        >What’s there to hate besides the bad framerate?

I could overlook everything and was even getting a feel for the *combat system until I got to that fucking swamp.

Fuck that swamp. I hate it and no one can make me like it.



*once you realize it functions more like an isometric point and click than a more modern third person control scheme it's really not even bad, so if complaints about the combat system have put you off and you're comfortable with iso games give it a whirl sometime
            It was, at least for me, significantly improved with the Enhanced Edition. The swamp became a lot more tolerable.
            [deleted]
                The backtracking, mostly.
        The combat is incredibly janky man.  I didn't hate it, but I'm also pretty forgiving of lackluster combat systems in my RPG's if the other aspects are good.  I can see why it'd be a deal breaker for others.  

It's fairly dated in other ways as well.  Not just the graphics but also like.....collecting prostitute cards and shit...
            It’s also dated because it’s dated.  It’s from 2007.
Could be nostalgia but The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay was one of the best games based on a film, at least at the time.
    Just watched the GVMERS video on that. The game was critically praised and in an interview the dev team said that Vin Disel really took his time to nail down the lines and nail the character
Vin is also staring in Ark 2. He apparently loves playing ark.
    Me too.  After around 800 hours is when I leave my thumbs down review :)
He almost got passed over for Superman because he was raiding in World of Warcraft when the call came in to offer him the role and he ignored it due to being focused on the game.  Dude absolutely has true gamer cred.

Edit: Apparently it was actually just a congratulatory call from the director, but still, cred earned.
    He was not almost passed over, it was a congratulatory call from Zack Synder telling him he got it.
        "Henry is the best candidate for this role, let's tell him. Oh but if he doesn't pick up our first call, we're picking somebody else."
        Well that story ain't gonna cut it for the Dianes who watch late night tv, MrChangg
            >Well that story ain't gonna cut it for the Dianes 

Yes, the Dianes...not the giga chads reposting that exact story on reddit
    "You should probably pick up the phone dude."

"Ok fine give me a sec. Alright I'm back, I'm going to become Superman so I have to leave now, see you tomorrow."

"What?"
    Dude also says the only reason he’s so fit is he has to do that so he doesn’t just get fat playing video games all the time
Or Tom Holland. He said he played spiderman on ps5 and loves the swinging. Also he considers the game version as legit as him or Miles from Into the spiderverse.
    Cavill and Holland were just on Graham Norton's show last week or so.  Norton is a UK talk/chat show and part of what is interesting about the show compared to U.S. talk shows is that the guests spend quite a bit of time on stage together so you get to see how they interact.  

Norton was asking Cavill about his experience filming s2 of The Witcher and also about his interest in WarHammer.  Norton was being a little bit of a dick about it and low-key shaming Cavill for enjoying his hobby, which I found annoying because I feel like for the most part the world has moved beyond trying to make fun of people for that sort of thing.  I typically enjoy Norton but I had to role my eyes a bit at that.

All of that being said, it was a pretty fun interview and it was nice to see Cavill be a sport about it.  I wonder if he ever gets tired of constantly being asked about things like playing WoW or WarHammer and being treated as if they're some crazy thing that he does as if millions of people don't enjoy similar hobbies.

Here's a clip for anyone who's interested in seeing a bit of the interview though.  Holland asking if he can come over to Cavill's home to play WarHammer is the best bit. 

[clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj4vCA2BCqo)
        As someone with 3 kids of different ages I can say with certainty the world has not moved on and many people still shamelessly and continously ridicule and bully people for this stuff. I would say the adult sphere has gotten a bit more tolerant and understanding of "nerd things" since I was a kid but that really depends on what circles you run in.
            You're probably right.  I guess part of my perception comes from the fact that I do my best not to keep those types of people in my life. Obviously that's easier to do as an adult than it would have been as a child.  

Also, while I've always been into nerdy hobbies like video games, D&D, anime, etc, I'm also pretty socially competent and I don't let my hobbies define me.  I sometimes enjoy talking about them with strangers, but I also recognize when a person isn't interested and I wouldn't try to press the issue.
        Yeah, I hate how people act like nerds are these fucking unicorns.  Meanwhile Joe Manganiello, Tom Morello, The Big Show, Vince Vaughan, etc all play fucking D&D together.

Which is hilarious because they played basic D&D, which is a lot of what my buddy would run.  A lot of these guys are not much different than any of my friend group, just operating at much higher financial level.

Personally I become a bigger fan of them because, while I'm no where close to Henry Cavill, I'm a lot closer to him than I am to some sort of stereotype.

Most of my D&D group is married with children, most of my video game buddies are mostly married with children as well.

I love sharing the experiences of some of the other nerd shit I do, like recently I've really gotten back into racing, and another one of my friends is an F1 fan, he's really pumped for me to receive delivery of my new racing sim setup (shoutout to /r/simracing) so he can decide if he wants to get one as well.

Another friend recently sold all his real firearms and got back into airsoft that he does outdoors and wants me to come along.  I think it'd be great fun to do, so I'll be doing that after the winter...

A lot of people are usually into some unique cool shit that if you just take a weekend to join them you might find something you're also really into.
That's cuz he's a real one
People are actually like legitimately offended that the vast majority of acting roles are “just jobs” to most actors and that there’s absolutely nothing wrong or unprofessional about that, and it hurts people’s feelings to learn that they aren’t their characters or that they aren’t superfans of the properties they’re in

Parasocial relationships lol

That being said hearing actors and voice actors be massive nerds is always great though
Yeah this is not the same thing as an actor saying they didn't play some random call of duty game they were in lol. CDPR apparently lied for press coverage or at the very least were extremely misleading.

Now is this a big deal? Not anywhere near as big a deal as all the other shit they've done, but this isn't typical at all.
So don't trust celebrity endorsement, but also don't trust secondhand celebrity endorsements.

Honestly, the second I'd have thought I could trust. Surely a CEO can't lie about what someone else said in the promotion of a product. That's like libel or something.
He probably played it for 30-60 minutes in a scripted area. the impression that he was working on his own playthrough was an intentional misleading statement to boost sales.
    Or the CEO is just lying.
        The CEO lying? Nah, couldn’t be. It’s not like there’s a track record we can look at here.
        The CEO didn’t say it, the journalist implied that the CEO implied it. It’s all implications lol
            You KNOW the CEO claimed he did.

Just like he claimed CP2077 was ready to ship, just like he claimed they would fix the game asap.

The CEO only cares about business decisions.
                I don’t know that because it wasn’t a quote. 

Again, it’s all implications.
They claimed a lot of things
Wait, so you’re saying CDPR leadership is… *gasp*… willing to lie to the public!!??
    ...shame...shame...shame...
They claimed it was finished
She's INSATIABLE.
    You’re INSATIABLE
    HOOR
First person shooters are like going to work for him.
    why play FPS when you can be the FPS
And when they asked if he'd like to go online to play with a bunch of teenage boys, he thought it was a trap.
    They only wanted to scree his mom so he wasn't interested
Despite the fact that as I grew older I realised he was always a twist villain, I still loved every film and game he was in just because I liked him. Guess he was a twist villain in real life too...
    Art imitates life
I will literally never play it. Would hope they wouldn’t dare after everything.

        I would pay for an RDR2 update though…
    That's almost *exactly* what people said when others were being doubtful about CP77 and how good it would be when rushed out and especially on the older gen consoles.

"They wouldn't release a bad game" and "they wouldn't release an unfinished game" or "they *care* about gamers" and other nonsense.

Especially since they've *only* released unfinished games, W1, W2 and W3 were all rather busted on release and needed a lot of ironing to become proper good.

And now people are doing it again "they would never!".  
A lot of the old guard and the people who made the older games fantastic have left the studio.  
Let's just wait and see what they do, but don't bet on it being some altruistic deed on their part.
        Wtf are you talking about? They’ve confirmed multiple times on financial reports that it’ll be free + they’ve also tweeted about it being free every time it’s mentioned. You’re insane if you think they’ll suddenly just add a price to it for literally no reason seeing as paid DLC will be out next year.
            Anybody who thinks they're going to pull the bait and switch on this one has finally lost the plot.

>They’ve confirmed multiple times on financial reports

This alone should end the conversation.

And yet... redditors are convinced CDPR is a cartoon villain stealing candy from babies.
I bought it for $10 the other day. Heard it runs good enough on ps5 and I have an itch to play an rpg but on the other hand I want to get the full experience down the line
    Had no problems with performance on series x at launch. My main issue was how shitty the gameplay was, not bugs
        I played and finished it on PS5 without any major issues.

World is dead and boring.

        This exactly. It reminds me of that episode of Rick and Morty where they are stuck in the simulation. Except in CB2077 you are Jerry with the broken subpar simulation. 

Half the enemies I could literally stand still and blow then away with clip after clip.

The balance sucks too. After trying the escape from the tower (early game moment) and being overwhelmed a few times, I just ran straight through the whole thing. Half the enemies just stood still.

    If that's greasy then I'm a Mcdonald's bag
Thats a lot of work for $20. The gas it took to get to the stores probably cost more than that.
    I made $100 in store credit "profit," Best Buy was across the street from GameStop, and I never went back to GameStop when it wasn't convenient for me i.e. I went shopping nearby. I've since moved and I certainly wouldn't do it now with everything being 10-15 minutes away.
    Have you never driven a car or paid for gas before?
    [deleted]
    It's $200, $40 each trip as they took one for each console. Do it when you're going there for other things or spend a few bucks on fuel....
Very much true. I work in IT and as much as I love technology I hardly ever want to look at that stuff outside of work.
    I use excel at work. I love it so much I use it on the weekends.
        LPT -- Sounds like you have what it takes to go to the pros! Up your game by getting into [Excel as an esport](https://old.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/comments/rdm91n/top_excel_experts_will_battle_it_out_in_an/)!

        Lmaoooo
    I feel the same way as an animator. When I finish a project I'm obviously proud of it but i also never want to see it again
    Yeah, it's a nasty side effect of the saying 'If you do it for love, the money comes anyway': you love doing X, you get paid doing X, you can no longer look at X outside the work.
    Also work in tech and this is usually how I feel too.

That said, I have been pushing my wife to push forward with starting a small business as I'd really like the tool I work on in real life. I've been in tech for like seven years and have never once been able to do that. Curse of b2b I guess.
for many people, playing something you've worked on will just remind you of all the problems that are still in the game. "ah man we could've fixed that! god damn it that's the wrong texture."
    Or in worse cases, the crunch times.

Imagine an LA Noire worker finding an area that gave him PTSD
    I completely understand that too. Part of why I don’t want to be a game dev, because I’d nitpick everything and I wouldn’t enjoy it. I think that goes for anything you create from music, to art, tattooing, to videogames. I bet drake doesn’t listen to his music once he’s done with it.
        Lady Gaga once said the same sentiment, listening to her own music makes her find all kinds of problems with it.
Im sure the main people, artists, programmers play the game over and over as they gotta make it work
    many artists in industry don’t play games at all, not just their game
I think that's a clearer case. If you make The Last of Us, that game isn't going to be as emotionally impactful to you, is it? Because you spent three months staring at one corner of the room and have had it super, super, super spoiled for you.
He's more of a Morrowind guy.
He definitely plays a female Orc with all of the sex mods
In the Friends reunion Jennifer Aniston said she hasn’t watched the later seasons, but they all have watched the earlier seasons.
It's up to the actor. They attend the premiere, but a lot of them slip out of the movie and go drink backstage or in the green room with their peers.
Actually a lot of actors go to the premiere, but leave as soon as the movie starts by a back door or something like that
sure they did! a promotional interview would NEVER lie about a 60 year old man loving video games!
    They're 52 and 56 respectively.
You know he did. He actually asked to be in that game because he was a huge fan of fallout 3. He actually developed carpal tunnel from playing it so much and bought 360s and a copy of the game and gave it out to friends. Hell he went in Ellen once and gave her one.
    Haha yeah I should have figured, I forgot about the CT he got from fo3.
Did he play horizon zero dawn though?
“Most”. Didn’t say all.
Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold.
also Nathan Filion was a hunter main i think
Wasn't he a Warlock main?
"Most" might have been a bit hyperbolic. "A lot" is probably accurate though. It's pretty common.
    Just about all actors go to the premieres, what happens in those situations? These are serious questions as well because I don't know the process. I know there are actors who don't like watching themselves but haven't really heard of many that haven't seen their own movies.
        They still know the script.
        It's up to the actor. They attend the premiere, but a lot of them slip out of the movie and go drink backstage or in the green room with their peers.
Yea there's definitely a lot wrong with the country but you knew what I meant lol
I bought the game on sale 3 years ago and only played 30-60 minutes or it, sorry everyone else but i failed to see the hype
If I remember correctly theres an underwater ability and 0 missions etc with pools for said ability
Why use cars when you can use the motorcycles that go nyoom?
Sure, but people can still like the game lol

Is that after or before GTA 6?
    After GTA 6, before Elder Scrolls 6
It puts CDPR in even deeper shit.

There's Witcher 3, and on the other end of the scale, Cyberpunk.

So, a very good game, and not such a good game (as a whole). 

I think most of us doubt they will get back to Witcher 3 level any time soon.
Saying that he liked something does not = to him playing the game. They more than likely showed him specific Silverhands scenes and he enjoyed it.
    They said he was playing his own playthrough. They lied.
    then say that instead?

    The recent interview he did with Carrie-Anne Moss he laughed about it and said it was a compliment while Carrie stated that she would hate it if it was a character based on her.

            Yeah, I'd even say keannus feelings are probably a little more complicated than the interview suggests. He spoke sarcastically a few times in the interview and with his inflection it's pretty hard to tell the difference.
                > with his inflection it's pretty hard to tell the difference

Gen X for the win. We don't even know when we're being sarcastic
                    You're so right. There i go doing it again! Naw I'm just "fucking around"
                    This made me spit out of coffee, no joke..

                    Isn’t he technically a boomer?
                        Wikipedia defines Gen X as born '65-'80. He was born Sept '64. 

He is undeniably a Gen X icon, becoming famous during the early 90s. Hell, he was even in a rock band in the 90s.
            I think that both their reactions (Keanu being stoked and Carrie-Anne being offput) are both completely reasonable.

It's for legal reasons because it involves the physical likeness of a person, even with Keanu's apparently carefree endorsement of the practice I 1000% understand where they're coming from.
                Yep they basically just said that we want to be able to book people without having to have them worry about them being forced into sex scenes


Reasonable really
                Once you say it's okay for Modders to make graphic sex scenes with your celebrity endorsement lookalikes models good luck getting other celebrity endorsements
                Especially after what happened with ~~Ellen~~ Elliot Page in that one game.
                    Ootl?
                        Beyond: two souls. Hackers/modders managed to find the full video picture in the game files or something and added a mod so during a shower scene you could see her (at the time) nude.
                    I forgot all about the Ellen page hack. Still kind of weird that Quantic Dream rendered a nude model for her in-game. Seemed a little unnecessary
                        It was David Cage specifically, dude is a grade A creep and I wouldn't be surprised if it came out that he was another sex pervert.
                        BTW, his name's Elliot
            Yeah fuck the guys telling weird stupid losers to not make mods to fuck a celebrity in their mediocre shitfest game.
                Idk, I doubt they’re stupid if they’re making these mods. Just weird losers, not weird stupid losers loool

Advertising works especially well on people who think they’re immune to it because those people truly believe their wants and desires are organic.
Glad to hear it, sorry you had to learn the hard way.  I learned the hard way with No Man's Sky myself.  How susceptible I was to the hype market.

Not anymore.  No more preorders, never on launch.  Between price drops and patches, someone on r/patientgamers told me something that's stuck with me ever since: 

"When you buy a game at launch, you're pay the highest price for the worst version of the game."
    New World sends its regards.
        Fallout 76, Battlefield 2042, Halo Infinite etc. etc. Not as bad as No Man's Sky but pretty bad. That was where I learned my lesson but I didn't even buy NMS. Just watched everyone else get upset after they wasted their money and decided I would never preorder.

Hitman 3

&#x200B;

I was happy pre-ordering these games, and did not regret. Just be careful i guess when a games has a hype train going strong.
Tbh he was a much much bigger part of the game then I thought he was going to be, he’s basically the main and best character in the game.
I played cyberpunk for the first time a few weeks ago when I bought it on sale on a whim. It’s actually pretty fun. But it still feels kinda half finished. The sex scenes are terrible, the “shards” are way too many and annoying. Vehicle driving which is a huge part of the game is terrible.

And it’s really buggy, like random floating text, crashes, audio problems, visual glitches. And this is on a pc with a 3090. 

But it was better than I was expecting, and Keanu reeves was the best part
When they introduced him for the first time in the game quite a lot of ppl went crazy over it... and I could not understand why. Ok, CD Red hired a well known actor but would that mean the game had good code or a well written story ?
Im pretty sure the hype for this game was huge well before all of the keanu publicity
    True, very true. That first trailer (2013 I think) was basically just a still image and people were way too excited for it.
        I remember exactly what I thought and even how I felt when I first learned of CP2077.  I wasn't so much excited about the game itself but more about the fact that CDPR was doing it and that basically guaranteed something amazing.  For my part, I loathe this game and I refused to jump on the hate bandwagon at first but seriously, this game is categorically a pile of shit.  It's unfixable.  It's unpatcheable.  Just needs to be remade completely or abandoned.  Off topic, I know.
            Their first mistake in a world of extreme (or supposed to be extreme) body modifications was to make it first person. Can’t see my clothes, or anything that makes my character unique.
                but hey what about that *one* functioning mirror
                Yeah that's why I never considered buying it even before people were upset. As soon as I saw 1st person I wasn't interested anymore
                    I still don’t understand the choice. Game would have been amazing even in its broken state with that.
            >more about the fact that CDPR was doing it and that basically guaranteed something amazing.

What? Your talking about CDPR right? The Witcher 1 & 2 were mediocre and TW3 was a buggy broken mess at launch. CDPR was having news about crunch and lead devs leaving for years after TW3 launch and before CP2077.

Why the hell did you think that CDPR making it would mean it would be good. That's like believing that a Bioware game now means that it would be good.

                    What? Witcher 2 was huge, which is why there was a ton of hype for 3. I was watching gaming YouTube around that time so I saw it for myself
                    It sold 1.7 million copies in the first week...
            I thoroughly enjoyed the game  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
            I agree man. I managed to buy a ps5 this spring and I still haven’t bothered to try cyber punk on next gen. The game was just plain bad and missing lots of content that CD promised us beforehand, but quietly ignored once the focus became more the bug filled glitchy game
    From what I read it was turning out to be a great game before Keanu got onboard.  The execs had the devs change up the story and leave out parts of the game to accommodate the new main character.
        [deleted]
            I don't think it's really fair to say he was part of thr problem, I doubt he demanded that he be put in way more of the game. My guy hasn't even played it so I don't think he really gives a shit about video games or having a prominent role in one.

Somehow, somebody got a hold of his agent and pitched the idea, Keanu went yeah alright that might be kinda fun and they're paying me a lot, and CDPR made the decision to change everything around him.
                I don't think these guys are saying Keanu set out to ruin the game like it's his fault. They are saying simply including him so late in the process caused the development schedule to fail.
        I'd say it's more accurate to frame it as "It was turning out to be a great game before CDPR went public and the execs decided to recruit a celebrity name for mass appeal to appease investors while" still fitting the cyberpunk feel""

That said, I can't go wrong with Keanu Reeves.
Willem Dafoe in Beyond Two Souls?
    He’s in that?
The plethora of famous actors doing the voices in GTA: Vice City definitely made the game better (for me).
For me, the reveal was exciting because I thought Keanu Reeves had that unique vibe to him that suited the sort of folk hero rocker that is Johnny Silverhand.

Otherwise, yeah it’s a case by case basis for me. Heck, in some cases, the celebrity made the game worse, like Matthew Perry in New Vegas or Mena Suvari in Kingdom Hearts.

And then you have Tim Curry in Red Alert 3 and he automatically elevates everything with the amount of ham on display.
    Matthew Perry's deliveries are pretty iconic. I'm not saying the guy was acting his heart out or anything and a lot of it rests on the strength of the writing but Benny's a memorable character and he added to that.
    While I understand your point and your example is valid, I liked Matthew Perry in New Vegas, I suspect a reasonable percentage of players do.
    Perry was spot on as a sleazy 50s gambler / mobster. And he was an actual fan of the game, as opposed to Keanu.

*'I hit what I was aiming for. Guess you had brains to spare'*
    I've heard almost nothing but positive reception about Matthew Perry as Bennie..
    There's a good chance Keanu being in the game fucked it. Scuttlebutt is the game was supposed to have a whole different story and do more with the lifepaths but a lot of stuff got binned or hurriedly repurposed to serve the Johnny Silverhand storyline.
        My head cannon with no absolute basis in reality is that Keanu reeves would cameo as Johnny silverhand in one of their many quests and when they found out they couldn't deliver such a large scoped game they scaled it down and turned his cameo into the whole story of the game.
        Too many fundamental features were left in a state of "that'll do" for me to really believe this. I'd say bringing Keanu on in such a large role is just another symptom of the problem.
    Whoa whoa whoa! Matt Perry was a damn good Benny! Let’s keep it in the groove, okay my man? Smooth moves, like smooth little babies.
    You take that back, perry in new vegas was pretty great!
You could say the same of films. Some films he's done have been nigh unwatchable. Doesn't meant you can't be happy he's in it.
It's not unreasonable to be excited about something, because your favorite actor is in it
    he is overrated as fuck, especially on reddit
Brutal Legend. Just wouldn't be the same.
It was the must play game because it was going to be The Witcher 3 in a futuristic setting. Keanu being in the game was just a nice little cherry on top.
That Russian therapist definitely made until dawn better. Although he's not exactly the most famous actor out there.
    John Abruzzi shoutout.
Play Dishonored. Mike Madsen, Brad Dourif, Susan Sarandon, to name a few. Game is fucking iconic, and voice acted marvelously.
    Oh man, and Vincent D'Onofrio in the sequel is amazing.
> just because Keanu was in it   

nobody did that. It was all Witcher 3 hype.
We bought it because of Witcher 3 - Keanu only added extra hype for it.
    What I learned is be aware of one hit wonders
I know Cavill is a big nerd, but does Tom Felton really play games too?
    Yeah. AFAIK he plays a shit ton of RTS’s and simulation games.

Also Taran Killam plays a variety as well.
Matthew Perry is also a gamer and a huge Fallout fan.
That's exactly what it is.
    And the quote before it is from Krusty the Clown.
Yep. Jaws: The Revenge
    Ah, Jaws the revenge. Where the ghost of the shark from the first movie comes back and attacks the family of the characters from the first movie. Because what self-respecting shark wouldn't want to seek revenge for its murder by attacking the family members of the people who killed it?
        It’s not a ghost shark. It’s just a shark. That is somehow implied to be the same shark that was blown up and electrocuted and blown up again.

In all fairness, Jaws The Revenge is only the 2nd worst Jaws film. Jaws 3D is ridiculously boring.
            An entertaining bad movie is still an entertaining movie. A boring bad movie is just a waste of time.
                Tarkovsky movies be like
            Agreed but imo if you had to sit through revenge or 3D, assuming its in the theatre with the glasses, I would watch 3D.  2D there is zero reason to watch it.
        Is this the Ebert review?
        I guess now I'm going to have to see this. I watched the first 3 but never got around to seeing Jaws get his revenge.
Johnny Depp and Adam Driver are example of actors that don't watch their own movies
    Doesn't Adam Driver have a phobia when it comes to watching him on screen? I remember him walking out of a NPR interview where they were going to show him a clip of one of the movies he was in.
        What is with people trying shit like that in interviews anyway?
            That kind of assumes they knew about his phobia though, doesn't it? IMO it's pretty normal to show clips during interviews, in fact it's pretty standard nowadays on talk shows.
                you may be right, but I have heard before that with interviews there is usually a discussion beforehand of topics and any ground rules. I would suspect if this bothers him this much his agent is sure to mention it when setting up the interview, leading to my suspicion that the interviewer knew and was pushing a boundary, possibly to get a cool story of 'Adam Driver watches one of his movies for the first time' or some shit. Again, I am talking out my ass, but it makes sense to me anyways
                    Yeah I suppose that makes sense
    I don’t personally believe any actor who says that.
        I don't think it's hard to believe. I still can't listen to recordings of my musical performances, decades after I stopped playing. Some people are just overly critical of their own stuff.
        They just cringe too much at it.

Many actors, or artists, will tell you there is a deep uncomfortable feeling to see your work at full display.

They see the mistakes, the lines they did not deliver enough, the shot that took 40 takes and still could not make the cut as intended, etc, etc...
don't get high on your own supply
Was it Paul aberrant? He said he had never seen any of the marvel movies till he was asked to play vision.

EDIT: Bettany idk what happened there.
    You mean Paul Bettany?
        Oh my god yeah lol sorry my auto correct must have went crazy.
            Haha no worries
I wish I could do that. I don’t get how people can relax while at the same time actively doing something :/
Bill Nighy doesn't watch the stuff he's in
why he got to be a nerd lol
She’s not?

But but I went to a Hooter’s once…
Valid strategy too if you want to play an exclusive, but don't want to get a console just to play one game.
lol, you just blew a load with the group and the post-nut clarity set in, all in one comment.
    so far my favorite comment of all time
    That wasn't my intention but I guess I can see why it seems that way. I think Keanu is a cool dude from what we know about him. But maybe I am wrong and he is a KKK member or something.
        This is how I feel about basically every half decent celebrity out there.

    I think maybe because its inevitable is why he's saying it, once that meets the apex of cost efficiency and practically being able to do it, there will be no choice for studios.
        And at the end of the day, why would you care? If it’s gotten to that point, it’ll probably be impossible to tell the difference.
    The movie The Congress explored this possibility. Beautiful and scary af.
    People said this exact stuff about switching to digital capture from film back in the day too, and look where we are now. 

The "mainstream" and majority will slowly move over, and quality will generally be lower for a while as the kinks are worked out and technology improves (see *Rogue One* Peter Cushing and Carrie Fisher, or *The Irishman*), but even once it's the norm there will be throwbacks with real casting and classic cinephiles hiring noteworthy performers (Tarantino, Edgar Wright, Rian Johnson, Ken Brannagh) to do it "for real". We'll also probably get a lot more motion capture and "digital acting" where it still *is* them but their appearance on screen can be entirely disconnected from their own immediate physicality.
    >Id rather see real actors act, not watch cgi.

But that's the thing, what if you couldn't even tell if it's real or CGI? A lot of action scenes in big movies already use full CGI replacements, you don't even know it half the time.
        [If you can't tell, does it matter?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaahx4hMxmw)
            There's something oddly unsettling about seeing that woman portray a robot, particularly after she was married to Elon Musk of all people.
    Why is it scary? If its still the actor performing… like they haven’t been using globs of make up and lighting to make actors look younger since the dawn of film.

Also Keanu has already done this in the Matrix and a full CG film called A Scanner Darkly, so this opinion should come as no surprise.
    In reality we’ll probably get to a point in the next 10 years where film crews are capturing motion and spatial data instead of recording light onto celluloid, movies are effectively rendered from 3D into a flat 2D image, and the concept of “CGI actors” will be kind of quaint because everything will technically be “cgi” even if it was shot on a set with real actors.
    > d rather see real actors act, not watch cgi.

I get ya, but what if you could not tell the difference?
    When you won't be able to tell the difference, does it really matter? Obviously we're far from not being able to tell if it's a real person or not, but when we can do that...
What you don't like r/KeanuBeingAwesome? Super weird subreddit

John Cena is such a wimpy baby that he wouldn’t publicly recognize Taiwan as a country. Fucking wuss told 23.57 million people that he values money over their lives and safety.
Originally it just meant being true to yourself or genuine ([attributed to Lil B the based god](https://youtu.be/prekbB1HOLQ)), but since then it's evolved to mean "this agrees with my personal ideological beliefs" which is why you'll usually see it referred to in a political context. Left wingers will call someone based if they say capitalism is evil, and right wingers will say "based and redpilled" if someone says something racist or misogynistic. In general they're just saying correct.

Here he is at Comic-Con actually walking through and explaining what a witcher is:

    Lmao the writer saying she had Henry's voice in her head when writing Geralt and the interviewer straight up said "I also often have Henry's voice in my head" hahahaha. I wonder if it makes him uncomfortable? As a man, I never mind being complimented like that, but it also happens so rarely.
        It gets old, and especially for him I can imagine it gets REALLY fucking old.
        I also wouldn't mind it for the same reason as you (male, don't get complimented like that too often), but there is a double standard at play here.  Everybody would get very mad if somebody said the same thing to, say, Scarlett Johansson.
            I am honestly unsure. When I hear women talking about that sort of thing, it's usually because it's *too* often (as in, incessant), very crude (hey hot stuff, wanna sex my sexy sex), or there's an imbalance of power (it's hard for a woman to defend herself against a guy). So Im wondering if Henry Cavill feel any of those things.
I’m surprised they made a second after the 1st one.
    The 1sr one was the first game by CD Project Red and it had a lot of interesting ideas that people hadn't seen in an RPG at that point. To be sure, no one said it was perfect, or even a classic, but it was a damn good game with a mature storyline, mature gameplay elements, and a mysticism about running around slaying shit with not one, but two swords. I can totally see why they made 2 and 3. Can't wait for the next installment!
        The original Witcher is what is often described as "Eurojank". Where the game is janky as all hell, and sometimes just garbage to play, but the ideas are so unique and no other game does something like it that it does build a community up around it. 

I think Metro 2033 is an example of a more polished Eurojank game. Stuff like wiping your gas mask off and needing to change if it got damaged, or change the air packs for it manually were unusual mechanics that were interesting. And it had a number of odd mechanics like that, on PC it uses like a dozen buttons more than most shooters because of all the weird stuff in it.
            STALKER has that same kinda vibe. Shit is weird, has dozens of things to do, your entire keyboard is bound to some function or another.

I could never finish W1 though, I tried hard, I finished W2 like 7 or 8 times and once on the permadeath one.
                STALKER is just pure Eurojank done perfectly, super deep universe, interesting ideas explored, quite dark and depressing, entire game is a technical marvel held together by elmers glue and ductape that you almost have to fight at times to force it not to die every hour.
            Witcher 1 was built off of an engine that still used the D&D style rulesets that pretty much all the Bioware games prior to Dragon Age 2 had. That's why the combat was so strange compared to modern games; you weren't clicking a button to swing a sword, you were clicking a button to "cast the spell of swinging a sword".

If you can get passed the outdated graphics, wonky combat and a steep learning curve of a UI then the game itself is quite good.
            > Where the game is janky as all hell, and sometimes just garbage to play, but the ideas are so unique and no other game does something like it that it does build a community up around it.

That sounds like Two Worlds. It had some great stuff, and some really, really bad stuff.
        After cyberpunk I don't want another installment.
    The game was eurojank even back then but there weren't really many games like it at the time. The issues were a bit more reasonable back then than vs now so the story was really the big draw and the story was great.
    The eurojank game Dev economy always baffles me, but they managed to escape the "eurojank" title, even with the second game
        > The eurojank game Dev economy always baffles me..

Why?  
A "genre" (for the lack of a better term) that often has high ambitions and does interesting (and often baffling) decisions because they can is nothing but a positive.  

I'm not surprised at all that they have a lot of customers. Easier to justify buying a 20-40€ game that tries new things and has an interesting idea than 60-80€ for a game that looks nice but plays it suuuper safe.
        I can only speak for myself but as a lover of eurojank i think the attraction is that they tend to be novel and interesting, they often have weird and interesting mechanics or plots and have a strange earnestness to them as they don't seem to be trying too hard to make money or even be liked. This allows a cult following of weirdo hipsters to form around them, much like hard to listen to bands from genres only 6 people know exist.


Also it's just nice to have a game that feels European, has European sensibilities etc I know a lot of AAA games are made in Europe but they are made for the us market primarily and always seem to be either "America" styled or lacking any cultural identity whatsoever.
    After "That Sword is for monsters" they fucking better have lol

    >What’s there to hate besides the bad framerate?

I could overlook everything and was even getting a feel for the *combat system until I got to that fucking swamp.

Fuck that swamp. I hate it and no one can make me like it.



*once you realize it functions more like an isometric point and click than a more modern third person control scheme it's really not even bad, so if complaints about the combat system have put you off and you're comfortable with iso games give it a whirl sometime
        It was, at least for me, significantly improved with the Enhanced Edition. The swamp became a lot more tolerable.
        [deleted]
            The backtracking, mostly.
    The combat is incredibly janky man.  I didn't hate it, but I'm also pretty forgiving of lackluster combat systems in my RPG's if the other aspects are good.  I can see why it'd be a deal breaker for others.  

It's fairly dated in other ways as well.  Not just the graphics but also like.....collecting prostitute cards and shit...
        It’s also dated because it’s dated.  It’s from 2007.
Just watched the GVMERS video on that. The game was critically praised and in an interview the dev team said that Vin Disel really took his time to nail down the lines and nail the character
Me too.  After around 800 hours is when I leave my thumbs down review :)
He was not almost passed over, it was a congratulatory call from Zack Synder telling him he got it.

Cavill and Holland were just on Graham Norton's show last week or so.  Norton is a UK talk/chat show and part of what is interesting about the show compared to U.S. talk shows is that the guests spend quite a bit of time on stage together so you get to see how they interact.  

Norton was asking Cavill about his experience filming s2 of The Witcher and also about his interest in WarHammer.  Norton was being a little bit of a dick about it and low-key shaming Cavill for enjoying his hobby, which I found annoying because I feel like for the most part the world has moved beyond trying to make fun of people for that sort of thing.  I typically enjoy Norton but I had to role my eyes a bit at that.

All of that being said, it was a pretty fun interview and it was nice to see Cavill be a sport about it.  I wonder if he ever gets tired of constantly being asked about things like playing WoW or WarHammer and being treated as if they're some crazy thing that he does as if millions of people don't enjoy similar hobbies.

Here's a clip for anyone who's interested in seeing a bit of the interview though.  Holland asking if he can come over to Cavill's home to play WarHammer is the best bit.

    As someone with 3 kids of different ages I can say with certainty the world has not moved on and many people still shamelessly and continously ridicule and bully people for this stuff. I would say the adult sphere has gotten a bit more tolerant and understanding of "nerd things" since I was a kid but that really depends on what circles you run in.
        You're probably right.  I guess part of my perception comes from the fact that I do my best not to keep those types of people in my life. Obviously that's easier to do as an adult than it would have been as a child.  

Also, while I've always been into nerdy hobbies like video games, D&D, anime, etc, I'm also pretty socially competent and I don't let my hobbies define me.  I sometimes enjoy talking about them with strangers, but I also recognize when a person isn't interested and I wouldn't try to press the issue.
    Yeah, I hate how people act like nerds are these fucking unicorns.  Meanwhile Joe Manganiello, Tom Morello, The Big Show, Vince Vaughan, etc all play fucking D&D together.

Which is hilarious because they played basic D&D, which is a lot of what my buddy would run.  A lot of these guys are not much different than any of my friend group, just operating at much higher financial level.

Personally I become a bigger fan of them because, while I'm no where close to Henry Cavill, I'm a lot closer to him than I am to some sort of stereotype.

Most of my D&D group is married with children, most of my video game buddies are mostly married with children as well.

I love sharing the experiences of some of the other nerd shit I do, like recently I've really gotten back into racing, and another one of my friends is an F1 fan, he's really pumped for me to receive delivery of my new racing sim setup (shoutout to /r/simracing) so he can decide if he wants to get one as well.

Another friend recently sold all his real firearms and got back into airsoft that he does outdoors and wants me to come along.  I think it'd be great fun to do, so I'll be doing that after the winter...

A lot of people are usually into some unique cool shit that if you just take a weekend to join them you might find something you're also really into.
Or the CEO is just lying.
    The CEO lying? Nah, couldn’t be. It’s not like there’s a track record we can look at here.
    The CEO didn’t say it, the journalist implied that the CEO implied it. It’s all implications lol
        You KNOW the CEO claimed he did.

Just like he claimed CP2077 was ready to ship, just like he claimed they would fix the game asap.

The CEO only cares about business decisions.
            I don’t know that because it wasn’t a quote. 

Again, it’s all implications.

That's almost *exactly* what people said when others were being doubtful about CP77 and how good it would be when rushed out and especially on the older gen consoles.

"They wouldn't release a bad game" and "they wouldn't release an unfinished game" or "they *care* about gamers" and other nonsense.

Especially since they've *only* released unfinished games, W1, W2 and W3 were all rather busted on release and needed a lot of ironing to become proper good.

And now people are doing it again "they would never!".  
A lot of the old guard and the people who made the older games fantastic have left the studio.  
Let's just wait and see what they do, but don't bet on it being some altruistic deed on their part.
    Wtf are you talking about? They’ve confirmed multiple times on financial reports that it’ll be free + they’ve also tweeted about it being free every time it’s mentioned. You’re insane if you think they’ll suddenly just add a price to it for literally no reason seeing as paid DLC will be out next year.
        Anybody who thinks they're going to pull the bait and switch on this one has finally lost the plot.

This alone should end the conversation.

    This exactly. It reminds me of that episode of Rick and Morty where they are stuck in the simulation. Except in CB2077 you are Jerry with the broken subpar simulation. 

Half the enemies I could literally stand still and blow then away with clip after clip.

The balance sucks too. After trying the escape from the tower (early game moment) and being overwhelmed a few times, I just ran straight through the whole thing. Half the enemies just stood still.

I made $100 in store credit "profit," Best Buy was across the street from GameStop, and I never went back to GameStop when it wasn't convenient for me i.e. I went shopping nearby. I've since moved and I certainly wouldn't do it now with everything being 10-15 minutes away.

Yeah, it's a nasty side effect of the saying 'If you do it for love, the money comes anyway': you love doing X, you get paid doing X, you can no longer look at X outside the work.
Also work in tech and this is usually how I feel too.

That said, I have been pushing my wife to push forward with starting a small business as I'd really like the tool I work on in real life. I've been in tech for like seven years and have never once been able to do that. Curse of b2b I guess.
Or in worse cases, the crunch times.

Imagine an LA Noire worker finding an area that gave him PTSD
I completely understand that too. Part of why I don’t want to be a game dev, because I’d nitpick everything and I wouldn’t enjoy it. I think that goes for anything you create from music, to art, tattooing, to videogames. I bet drake doesn’t listen to his music once he’s done with it.
    Lady Gaga once said the same sentiment, listening to her own music makes her find all kinds of problems with it.
many artists in industry don’t play games at all, not just their game

Haha yeah I should have figured, I forgot about the CT he got from fo3.
Just about all actors go to the premieres, what happens in those situations? These are serious questions as well because I don't know the process. I know there are actors who don't like watching themselves but haven't really heard of many that haven't seen their own movies.
    They still know the script.
    It's up to the actor. They attend the premiere, but a lot of them slip out of the movie and go drink backstage or in the green room with their peers.

        Yeah, I'd even say keannus feelings are probably a little more complicated than the interview suggests. He spoke sarcastically a few times in the interview and with his inflection it's pretty hard to tell the difference.
            > with his inflection it's pretty hard to tell the difference

Gen X for the win. We don't even know when we're being sarcastic
                You're so right. There i go doing it again! Naw I'm just "fucking around"

                Isn’t he technically a boomer?
                    Wikipedia defines Gen X as born '65-'80. He was born Sept '64. 

He is undeniably a Gen X icon, becoming famous during the early 90s. Hell, he was even in a rock band in the 90s.
        I think that both their reactions (Keanu being stoked and Carrie-Anne being offput) are both completely reasonable.

It's for legal reasons because it involves the physical likeness of a person, even with Keanu's apparently carefree endorsement of the practice I 1000% understand where they're coming from.
            Yep they basically just said that we want to be able to book people without having to have them worry about them being forced into sex scenes


Reasonable really
            Once you say it's okay for Modders to make graphic sex scenes with your celebrity endorsement lookalikes models good luck getting other celebrity endorsements
            Especially after what happened with ~~Ellen~~ Elliot Page in that one game.
                Ootl?
                    Beyond: two souls. Hackers/modders managed to find the full video picture in the game files or something and added a mod so during a shower scene you could see her (at the time) nude.
                I forgot all about the Ellen page hack. Still kind of weird that Quantic Dream rendered a nude model for her in-game. Seemed a little unnecessary
                    It was David Cage specifically, dude is a grade A creep and I wouldn't be surprised if it came out that he was another sex pervert.
                    BTW, his name's Elliot
        Yeah fuck the guys telling weird stupid losers to not make mods to fuck a celebrity in their mediocre shitfest game.

Death Stranding

Hitman 3

&#x200B;

I was happy pre-ordering these games, and did not regret. Just be careful i guess when a games has a hype train going strong.
True, very true. That first trailer (2013 I think) was basically just a still image and people were way too excited for it.
    I remember exactly what I thought and even how I felt when I first learned of CP2077.  I wasn't so much excited about the game itself but more about the fact that CDPR was doing it and that basically guaranteed something amazing.  For my part, I loathe this game and I refused to jump on the hate bandwagon at first but seriously, this game is categorically a pile of shit.  It's unfixable.  It's unpatcheable.  Just needs to be remade completely or abandoned.  Off topic, I know.
        Their first mistake in a world of extreme (or supposed to be extreme) body modifications was to make it first person. Can’t see my clothes, or anything that makes my character unique.
            but hey what about that *one* functioning mirror
            Yeah that's why I never considered buying it even before people were upset. As soon as I saw 1st person I wasn't interested anymore
                I still don’t understand the choice. Game would have been amazing even in its broken state with that.
        >more about the fact that CDPR was doing it and that basically guaranteed something amazing.

What? Your talking about CDPR right? The Witcher 1 & 2 were mediocre and TW3 was a buggy broken mess at launch. CDPR was having news about crunch and lead devs leaving for years after TW3 launch and before CP2077.

Why the hell did you think that CDPR making it would mean it would be good. That's like believing that a Bioware game now means that it would be good.
            [deleted]
                What? Witcher 2 was huge, which is why there was a ton of hype for 3. I was watching gaming YouTube around that time so I saw it for myself
                It sold 1.7 million copies in the first week...
        I thoroughly enjoyed the game  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
        I agree man. I managed to buy a ps5 this spring and I still haven’t bothered to try cyber punk on next gen. The game was just plain bad and missing lots of content that CD promised us beforehand, but quietly ignored once the focus became more the bug filled glitchy game
From what I read it was turning out to be a great game before Keanu got onboard.  The execs had the devs change up the story and leave out parts of the game to accommodate the new main character.
    [deleted]
        I don't think it's really fair to say he was part of thr problem, I doubt he demanded that he be put in way more of the game. My guy hasn't even played it so I don't think he really gives a shit about video games or having a prominent role in one.

Somehow, somebody got a hold of his agent and pitched the idea, Keanu went yeah alright that might be kinda fun and they're paying me a lot, and CDPR made the decision to change everything around him.
            I don't think these guys are saying Keanu set out to ruin the game like it's his fault. They are saying simply including him so late in the process caused the development schedule to fail.
    I'd say it's more accurate to frame it as "It was turning out to be a great game before CDPR went public and the execs decided to recruit a celebrity name for mass appeal to appease investors while" still fitting the cyberpunk feel""

That said, I can't go wrong with Keanu Reeves.
He’s in that?
Matthew Perry's deliveries are pretty iconic. I'm not saying the guy was acting his heart out or anything and a lot of it rests on the strength of the writing but Benny's a memorable character and he added to that.
While I understand your point and your example is valid, I liked Matthew Perry in New Vegas, I suspect a reasonable percentage of players do.
Perry was spot on as a sleazy 50s gambler / mobster. And he was an actual fan of the game, as opposed to Keanu.

*'I hit what I was aiming for. Guess you had brains to spare'*
I've heard almost nothing but positive reception about Matthew Perry as Bennie..
There's a good chance Keanu being in the game fucked it. Scuttlebutt is the game was supposed to have a whole different story and do more with the lifepaths but a lot of stuff got binned or hurriedly repurposed to serve the Johnny Silverhand storyline.
    My head cannon with no absolute basis in reality is that Keanu reeves would cameo as Johnny silverhand in one of their many quests and when they found out they couldn't deliver such a large scoped game they scaled it down and turned his cameo into the whole story of the game.
    Too many fundamental features were left in a state of "that'll do" for me to really believe this. I'd say bringing Keanu on in such a large role is just another symptom of the problem.
Whoa whoa whoa! Matt Perry was a damn good Benny! Let’s keep it in the groove, okay my man? Smooth moves, like smooth little babies.
You take that back, perry in new vegas was pretty great!
he is overrated as fuck, especially on reddit
John Abruzzi shoutout.
Oh man, and Vincent D'Onofrio in the sequel is amazing.
What I learned is be aware of one hit wonders
Yeah. AFAIK he plays a shit ton of RTS’s and simulation games.

Also Taran Killam plays a variety as well.
And the quote before it is from Krusty the Clown.
Ah, Jaws the revenge. Where the ghost of the shark from the first movie comes back and attacks the family of the characters from the first movie. Because what self-respecting shark wouldn't want to seek revenge for its murder by attacking the family members of the people who killed it?
    It’s not a ghost shark. It’s just a shark. That is somehow implied to be the same shark that was blown up and electrocuted and blown up again.

In all fairness, Jaws The Revenge is only the 2nd worst Jaws film. Jaws 3D is ridiculously boring.
        An entertaining bad movie is still an entertaining movie. A boring bad movie is just a waste of time.
            Tarkovsky movies be like
        Agreed but imo if you had to sit through revenge or 3D, assuming its in the theatre with the glasses, I would watch 3D.  2D there is zero reason to watch it.
    Is this the Ebert review?
    I guess now I'm going to have to see this. I watched the first 3 but never got around to seeing Jaws get his revenge.
Doesn't Adam Driver have a phobia when it comes to watching him on screen? I remember him walking out of a NPR interview where they were going to show him a clip of one of the movies he was in.
    What is with people trying shit like that in interviews anyway?
        That kind of assumes they knew about his phobia though, doesn't it? IMO it's pretty normal to show clips during interviews, in fact it's pretty standard nowadays on talk shows.
            you may be right, but I have heard before that with interviews there is usually a discussion beforehand of topics and any ground rules. I would suspect if this bothers him this much his agent is sure to mention it when setting up the interview, leading to my suspicion that the interviewer knew and was pushing a boundary, possibly to get a cool story of 'Adam Driver watches one of his movies for the first time' or some shit. Again, I am talking out my ass, but it makes sense to me anyways
                Yeah I suppose that makes sense
I don’t personally believe any actor who says that.
    I don't think it's hard to believe. I still can't listen to recordings of my musical performances, decades after I stopped playing. Some people are just overly critical of their own stuff.
    They just cringe too much at it.

Many actors, or artists, will tell you there is a deep uncomfortable feeling to see your work at full display.

They see the mistakes, the lines they did not deliver enough, the shot that took 40 takes and still could not make the cut as intended, etc, etc...
You mean Paul Bettany?
    Oh my god yeah lol sorry my auto correct must have went crazy.
        Haha no worries
so far my favorite comment of all time
That wasn't my intention but I guess I can see why it seems that way. I think Keanu is a cool dude from what we know about him. But maybe I am wrong and he is a KKK member or something.
    This is how I feel about basically every half decent celebrity out there.
Nut*
I think maybe because its inevitable is why he's saying it, once that meets the apex of cost efficiency and practically being able to do it, there will be no choice for studios.
    And at the end of the day, why would you care? If it’s gotten to that point, it’ll probably be impossible to tell the difference.
The movie The Congress explored this possibility. Beautiful and scary af.
People said this exact stuff about switching to digital capture from film back in the day too, and look where we are now. 

The "mainstream" and majority will slowly move over, and quality will generally be lower for a while as the kinks are worked out and technology improves (see *Rogue One* Peter Cushing and Carrie Fisher, or *The Irishman*), but even once it's the norm there will be throwbacks with real casting and classic cinephiles hiring noteworthy performers (Tarantino, Edgar Wright, Rian Johnson, Ken Brannagh) to do it "for real". We'll also probably get a lot more motion capture and "digital acting" where it still *is* them but their appearance on screen can be entirely disconnected from their own immediate physicality.
>Id rather see real actors act, not watch cgi.

But that's the thing, what if you couldn't even tell if it's real or CGI? A lot of action scenes in big movies already use full CGI replacements, you don't even know it half the time.
    [If you can't tell, does it matter?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaahx4hMxmw)
        There's something oddly unsettling about seeing that woman portray a robot, particularly after she was married to Elon Musk of all people.
Why is it scary? If its still the actor performing… like they haven’t been using globs of make up and lighting to make actors look younger since the dawn of film.

Also Keanu has already done this in the Matrix and a full CG film called A Scanner Darkly, so this opinion should come as no surprise.
In reality we’ll probably get to a point in the next 10 years where film crews are capturing motion and spatial data instead of recording light onto celluloid, movies are effectively rendered from 3D into a flat 2D image, and the concept of “CGI actors” will be kind of quaint because everything will technically be “cgi” even if it was shot on a set with real actors.
> d rather see real actors act, not watch cgi.

I get ya, but what if you could not tell the difference?
When you won't be able to tell the difference, does it really matter? Obviously we're far from not being able to tell if it's a real person or not, but when we can do that...
They lose their job, they’re fine money wise.

Lmao the writer saying she had Henry's voice in her head when writing Geralt and the interviewer straight up said "I also often have Henry's voice in my head" hahahaha. I wonder if it makes him uncomfortable? As a man, I never mind being complimented like that, but it also happens so rarely.
    It gets old, and especially for him I can imagine it gets REALLY fucking old.
    I also wouldn't mind it for the same reason as you (male, don't get complimented like that too often), but there is a double standard at play here.  Everybody would get very mad if somebody said the same thing to, say, Scarlett Johansson.
        I am honestly unsure. When I hear women talking about that sort of thing, it's usually because it's *too* often (as in, incessant), very crude (hey hot stuff, wanna sex my sexy sex), or there's an imbalance of power (it's hard for a woman to defend herself against a guy). So Im wondering if Henry Cavill feel any of those things.
The 1sr one was the first game by CD Project Red and it had a lot of interesting ideas that people hadn't seen in an RPG at that point. To be sure, no one said it was perfect, or even a classic, but it was a damn good game with a mature storyline, mature gameplay elements, and a mysticism about running around slaying shit with not one, but two swords. I can totally see why they made 2 and 3. Can't wait for the next installment!
    The original Witcher is what is often described as "Eurojank". Where the game is janky as all hell, and sometimes just garbage to play, but the ideas are so unique and no other game does something like it that it does build a community up around it. 

I think Metro 2033 is an example of a more polished Eurojank game. Stuff like wiping your gas mask off and needing to change if it got damaged, or change the air packs for it manually were unusual mechanics that were interesting. And it had a number of odd mechanics like that, on PC it uses like a dozen buttons more than most shooters because of all the weird stuff in it.
        STALKER has that same kinda vibe. Shit is weird, has dozens of things to do, your entire keyboard is bound to some function or another.

I could never finish W1 though, I tried hard, I finished W2 like 7 or 8 times and once on the permadeath one.
            STALKER is just pure Eurojank done perfectly, super deep universe, interesting ideas explored, quite dark and depressing, entire game is a technical marvel held together by elmers glue and ductape that you almost have to fight at times to force it not to die every hour.
        Witcher 1 was built off of an engine that still used the D&D style rulesets that pretty much all the Bioware games prior to Dragon Age 2 had. That's why the combat was so strange compared to modern games; you weren't clicking a button to swing a sword, you were clicking a button to "cast the spell of swinging a sword".

If you can get passed the outdated graphics, wonky combat and a steep learning curve of a UI then the game itself is quite good.
        > Where the game is janky as all hell, and sometimes just garbage to play, but the ideas are so unique and no other game does something like it that it does build a community up around it.

That sounds like Two Worlds. It had some great stuff, and some really, really bad stuff.
    After cyberpunk I don't want another installment.
The game was eurojank even back then but there weren't really many games like it at the time. The issues were a bit more reasonable back then than vs now so the story was really the big draw and the story was great.
The eurojank game Dev economy always baffles me, but they managed to escape the "eurojank" title, even with the second game
    > The eurojank game Dev economy always baffles me..

Why?  
A "genre" (for the lack of a better term) that often has high ambitions and does interesting (and often baffling) decisions because they can is nothing but a positive.  

I'm not surprised at all that they have a lot of customers. Easier to justify buying a 20-40€ game that tries new things and has an interesting idea than 60-80€ for a game that looks nice but plays it suuuper safe.
    I can only speak for myself but as a lover of eurojank i think the attraction is that they tend to be novel and interesting, they often have weird and interesting mechanics or plots and have a strange earnestness to them as they don't seem to be trying too hard to make money or even be liked. This allows a cult following of weirdo hipsters to form around them, much like hard to listen to bands from genres only 6 people know exist.


Also it's just nice to have a game that feels European, has European sensibilities etc I know a lot of AAA games are made in Europe but they are made for the us market primarily and always seem to be either "America" styled or lacking any cultural identity whatsoever.
After "That Sword is for monsters" they fucking better have lol
>What’s there to hate besides the bad framerate?

I could overlook everything and was even getting a feel for the *combat system until I got to that fucking swamp.

Fuck that swamp. I hate it and no one can make me like it.



*once you realize it functions more like an isometric point and click than a more modern third person control scheme it's really not even bad, so if complaints about the combat system have put you off and you're comfortable with iso games give it a whirl sometime
    It was, at least for me, significantly improved with the Enhanced Edition. The swamp became a lot more tolerable.
    [deleted]
        The backtracking, mostly.
The combat is incredibly janky man.  I didn't hate it, but I'm also pretty forgiving of lackluster combat systems in my RPG's if the other aspects are good.  I can see why it'd be a deal breaker for others.  

It's fairly dated in other ways as well.  Not just the graphics but also like.....collecting prostitute cards and shit...
    It’s also dated because it’s dated.  It’s from 2007.

As someone with 3 kids of different ages I can say with certainty the world has not moved on and many people still shamelessly and continously ridicule and bully people for this stuff. I would say the adult sphere has gotten a bit more tolerant and understanding of "nerd things" since I was a kid but that really depends on what circles you run in.
    You're probably right.  I guess part of my perception comes from the fact that I do my best not to keep those types of people in my life. Obviously that's easier to do as an adult than it would have been as a child.  

Also, while I've always been into nerdy hobbies like video games, D&D, anime, etc, I'm also pretty socially competent and I don't let my hobbies define me.  I sometimes enjoy talking about them with strangers, but I also recognize when a person isn't interested and I wouldn't try to press the issue.
Yeah, I hate how people act like nerds are these fucking unicorns.  Meanwhile Joe Manganiello, Tom Morello, The Big Show, Vince Vaughan, etc all play fucking D&D together.

Which is hilarious because they played basic D&D, which is a lot of what my buddy would run.  A lot of these guys are not much different than any of my friend group, just operating at much higher financial level.

Personally I become a bigger fan of them because, while I'm no where close to Henry Cavill, I'm a lot closer to him than I am to some sort of stereotype.

Most of my D&D group is married with children, most of my video game buddies are mostly married with children as well.

I love sharing the experiences of some of the other nerd shit I do, like recently I've really gotten back into racing, and another one of my friends is an F1 fan, he's really pumped for me to receive delivery of my new racing sim setup (shoutout to /r/simracing) so he can decide if he wants to get one as well.

Another friend recently sold all his real firearms and got back into airsoft that he does outdoors and wants me to come along.  I think it'd be great fun to do, so I'll be doing that after the winter...

A lot of people are usually into some unique cool shit that if you just take a weekend to join them you might find something you're also really into.
The CEO lying? Nah, couldn’t be. It’s not like there’s a track record we can look at here.

Just like he claimed CP2077 was ready to ship, just like he claimed they would fix the game asap.

The CEO only cares about business decisions.
        I don’t know that because it wasn’t a quote. 

Again, it’s all implications.

Lady Gaga once said the same sentiment, listening to her own music makes her find all kinds of problems with it.

It's up to the actor. They attend the premiere, but a lot of them slip out of the movie and go drink backstage or in the green room with their peers.

    Yeah, I'd even say keannus feelings are probably a little more complicated than the interview suggests. He spoke sarcastically a few times in the interview and with his inflection it's pretty hard to tell the difference.
        > with his inflection it's pretty hard to tell the difference

Gen X for the win. We don't even know when we're being sarcastic
            You're so right. There i go doing it again! Naw I'm just "fucking around"
            This made me spit out of coffee, no joke..

..but im on the toilet, and I'm not drinking coffee.
            Isn’t he technically a boomer?
                Wikipedia defines Gen X as born '65-'80. He was born Sept '64. 

He is undeniably a Gen X icon, becoming famous during the early 90s. Hell, he was even in a rock band in the 90s.
    I think that both their reactions (Keanu being stoked and Carrie-Anne being offput) are both completely reasonable.

Don't mind me.  I am definitely not over here.... umm... deleting my Mass Effect mods of Aria.

These are mods of an Aria from a different game.  Yea. You wouldn't know it.

Nobody tell Carrie about rule 34

He was especially pervy in that interview.. He let his guard down more than he normally does.
[deleted]
    That would be CDPR.

It's for legal reasons because it involves the physical likeness of a person, even with Keanu's apparently carefree endorsement of the practice I 1000% understand where they're coming from.
        Yep they basically just said that we want to be able to book people without having to have them worry about them being forced into sex scenes


Reasonable really
        Once you say it's okay for Modders to make graphic sex scenes with your celebrity endorsement lookalikes models good luck getting other celebrity endorsements
        Especially after what happened with ~~Ellen~~ Elliot Page in that one game.
            Ootl?
                Beyond: two souls. Hackers/modders managed to find the full video picture in the game files or something and added a mod so during a shower scene you could see her (at the time) nude.
            I forgot all about the Ellen page hack. Still kind of weird that Quantic Dream rendered a nude model for her in-game. Seemed a little unnecessary
                It was David Cage specifically, dude is a grade A creep and I wouldn't be surprised if it came out that he was another sex pervert.
                BTW, his name's Elliot
    Yeah fuck the guys telling weird stupid losers to not make mods to fuck a celebrity in their mediocre shitfest game.
        Idk, I doubt they’re stupid if they’re making these mods. Just weird losers, not weird stupid losers loool
Fallout 76, Battlefield 2042, Halo Infinite etc. etc. Not as bad as No Man's Sky but pretty bad. That was where I learned my lesson but I didn't even buy NMS. Just watched everyone else get upset after they wasted their money and decided I would never preorder.
I remember exactly what I thought and even how I felt when I first learned of CP2077.  I wasn't so much excited about the game itself but more about the fact that CDPR was doing it and that basically guaranteed something amazing.  For my part, I loathe this game and I refused to jump on the hate bandwagon at first but seriously, this game is categorically a pile of shit.  It's unfixable.  It's unpatcheable.  Just needs to be remade completely or abandoned.  Off topic, I know.
    Their first mistake in a world of extreme (or supposed to be extreme) body modifications was to make it first person. Can’t see my clothes, or anything that makes my character unique.
        but hey what about that *one* functioning mirror
        Yeah that's why I never considered buying it even before people were upset. As soon as I saw 1st person I wasn't interested anymore
            I still don’t understand the choice. Game would have been amazing even in its broken state with that.
    >more about the fact that CDPR was doing it and that basically guaranteed something amazing.

What? Your talking about CDPR right? The Witcher 1 & 2 were mediocre and TW3 was a buggy broken mess at launch. CDPR was having news about crunch and lead devs leaving for years after TW3 launch and before CP2077.

Why the hell did you think that CDPR making it would mean it would be good. That's like believing that a Bioware game now means that it would be good.
        [deleted]
            What? Witcher 2 was huge, which is why there was a ton of hype for 3. I was watching gaming YouTube around that time so I saw it for myself
            It sold 1.7 million copies in the first week...
    I thoroughly enjoyed the game  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
    I agree man. I managed to buy a ps5 this spring and I still haven’t bothered to try cyber punk on next gen. The game was just plain bad and missing lots of content that CD promised us beforehand, but quietly ignored once the focus became more the bug filled glitchy game
[deleted]
    I don't think it's really fair to say he was part of thr problem, I doubt he demanded that he be put in way more of the game. My guy hasn't even played it so I don't think he really gives a shit about video games or having a prominent role in one.

Somehow, somebody got a hold of his agent and pitched the idea, Keanu went yeah alright that might be kinda fun and they're paying me a lot, and CDPR made the decision to change everything around him.
        I don't think these guys are saying Keanu set out to ruin the game like it's his fault. They are saying simply including him so late in the process caused the development schedule to fail.
I'd say it's more accurate to frame it as "It was turning out to be a great game before CDPR went public and the execs decided to recruit a celebrity name for mass appeal to appease investors while" still fitting the cyberpunk feel""

That said, I can't go wrong with Keanu Reeves.
My head cannon with no absolute basis in reality is that Keanu reeves would cameo as Johnny silverhand in one of their many quests and when they found out they couldn't deliver such a large scoped game they scaled it down and turned his cameo into the whole story of the game.
Too many fundamental features were left in a state of "that'll do" for me to really believe this. I'd say bringing Keanu on in such a large role is just another symptom of the problem.
It’s not a ghost shark. It’s just a shark. That is somehow implied to be the same shark that was blown up and electrocuted and blown up again.

In all fairness, Jaws The Revenge is only the 2nd worst Jaws film. Jaws 3D is ridiculously boring.
    An entertaining bad movie is still an entertaining movie. A boring bad movie is just a waste of time.
        Tarkovsky movies be like
    Agreed but imo if you had to sit through revenge or 3D, assuming its in the theatre with the glasses, I would watch 3D.  2D there is zero reason to watch it.
Is this the Ebert review?
I guess now I'm going to have to see this. I watched the first 3 but never got around to seeing Jaws get his revenge.
What is with people trying shit like that in interviews anyway?
    That kind of assumes they knew about his phobia though, doesn't it? IMO it's pretty normal to show clips during interviews, in fact it's pretty standard nowadays on talk shows.
        you may be right, but I have heard before that with interviews there is usually a discussion beforehand of topics and any ground rules. I would suspect if this bothers him this much his agent is sure to mention it when setting up the interview, leading to my suspicion that the interviewer knew and was pushing a boundary, possibly to get a cool story of 'Adam Driver watches one of his movies for the first time' or some shit. Again, I am talking out my ass, but it makes sense to me anyways
            Yeah I suppose that makes sense
I don't think it's hard to believe. I still can't listen to recordings of my musical performances, decades after I stopped playing. Some people are just overly critical of their own stuff.
They just cringe too much at it.

Many actors, or artists, will tell you there is a deep uncomfortable feeling to see your work at full display.

They see the mistakes, the lines they did not deliver enough, the shot that took 40 takes and still could not make the cut as intended, etc, etc...
Oh my god yeah lol sorry my auto correct must have went crazy.
    Haha no worries
This is how I feel about basically every half decent celebrity out there.
And at the end of the day, why would you care? If it’s gotten to that point, it’ll probably be impossible to tell the difference.

    There's something oddly unsettling about seeing that woman portray a robot, particularly after she was married to Elon Musk of all people.
DDude I'm just playing ME2 for the first time ever and just did that section yesterday!!!
It gets old, and especially for him I can imagine it gets REALLY fucking old.
I also wouldn't mind it for the same reason as you (male, don't get complimented like that too often), but there is a double standard at play here.  Everybody would get very mad if somebody said the same thing to, say, Scarlett Johansson.
    I am honestly unsure. When I hear women talking about that sort of thing, it's usually because it's *too* often (as in, incessant), very crude (hey hot stuff, wanna sex my sexy sex), or there's an imbalance of power (it's hard for a woman to defend herself against a guy). So Im wondering if Henry Cavill feel any of those things.
The original Witcher is what is often described as "Eurojank". Where the game is janky as all hell, and sometimes just garbage to play, but the ideas are so unique and no other game does something like it that it does build a community up around it. 

I think Metro 2033 is an example of a more polished Eurojank game. Stuff like wiping your gas mask off and needing to change if it got damaged, or change the air packs for it manually were unusual mechanics that were interesting. And it had a number of odd mechanics like that, on PC it uses like a dozen buttons more than most shooters because of all the weird stuff in it.
    STALKER has that same kinda vibe. Shit is weird, has dozens of things to do, your entire keyboard is bound to some function or another.

I could never finish W1 though, I tried hard, I finished W2 like 7 or 8 times and once on the permadeath one.
        STALKER is just pure Eurojank done perfectly, super deep universe, interesting ideas explored, quite dark and depressing, entire game is a technical marvel held together by elmers glue and ductape that you almost have to fight at times to force it not to die every hour.
    Witcher 1 was built off of an engine that still used the D&D style rulesets that pretty much all the Bioware games prior to Dragon Age 2 had. That's why the combat was so strange compared to modern games; you weren't clicking a button to swing a sword, you were clicking a button to "cast the spell of swinging a sword".

If you can get passed the outdated graphics, wonky combat and a steep learning curve of a UI then the game itself is quite good.
    > Where the game is janky as all hell, and sometimes just garbage to play, but the ideas are so unique and no other game does something like it that it does build a community up around it.

That sounds like Two Worlds. It had some great stuff, and some really, really bad stuff.
After cyberpunk I don't want another installment.
> The eurojank game Dev economy always baffles me..

Why?  
A "genre" (for the lack of a better term) that often has high ambitions and does interesting (and often baffling) decisions because they can is nothing but a positive.  

I'm not surprised at all that they have a lot of customers. Easier to justify buying a 20-40€ game that tries new things and has an interesting idea than 60-80€ for a game that looks nice but plays it suuuper safe.
I can only speak for myself but as a lover of eurojank i think the attraction is that they tend to be novel and interesting, they often have weird and interesting mechanics or plots and have a strange earnestness to them as they don't seem to be trying too hard to make money or even be liked. This allows a cult following of weirdo hipsters to form around them, much like hard to listen to bands from genres only 6 people know exist.


Also it's just nice to have a game that feels European, has European sensibilities etc I know a lot of AAA games are made in Europe but they are made for the us market primarily and always seem to be either "America" styled or lacking any cultural identity whatsoever.
It was, at least for me, significantly improved with the Enhanced Edition. The swamp became a lot more tolerable.

    The backtracking, mostly.
It’s also dated because it’s dated.  It’s from 2007.
>Well that story ain't gonna cut it for the Dianes 

Yes, the Dianes...not the giga chads reposting that exact story on reddit
You're probably right.  I guess part of my perception comes from the fact that I do my best not to keep those types of people in my life. Obviously that's easier to do as an adult than it would have been as a child.  

Also, while I've always been into nerdy hobbies like video games, D&D, anime, etc, I'm also pretty socially competent and I don't let my hobbies define me.  I sometimes enjoy talking about them with strangers, but I also recognize when a person isn't interested and I wouldn't try to press the issue.
You KNOW the CEO claimed he did.

Just like he claimed CP2077 was ready to ship, just like he claimed they would fix the game asap.

The CEO only cares about business decisions.
    I don’t know that because it wasn’t a quote. 

Again, it’s all implications.
Anybody who thinks they're going to pull the bait and switch on this one has finally lost the plot.

>They’ve confirmed multiple times on financial reports

This alone should end the conversation.

And yet... redditors are convinced CDPR is a cartoon villain stealing candy from babies.
