[[Cyberpunk Edgerunner. What. A. Anime]]


Goddamn. I was not expecting this but this was truly a phenomenal anime. Everything for the plot, to the characters, to the soundtrack and the mixture of action with gore was mad. I really really hope cd projekt red and trigger make another one featuring new characters and a new arc as this one will end here im guessing. But now its done I feel empty af 😭😭

    It's truely sticking around for the long run. I keep watching the last 5 or so minutes of the end and almost restarting the pain.

            I can't help myself, it's just so good! It's almost like I'm hoping it will change or something, but I know it wont.
        [deleted]
            Same, I want to know what's going on with Lucy and Falco. It would be so cool if they somehow ended up back in the game or another story somewhere down the line. 

Hell, I'm more interested in this story than the regular game to be honest. Johnny was cool, but never felt like I cared for him, I want a crew like the show or beginning of the game.
    Hallmark of a good show. Just finished it and I have that emptiness as well.

    I just finished 30 minutes ago and I am hurting rn
It gave "I really wanna stay at your house" a whole lot of baggage.
    everytime i stick it on bluetooth in the car i just get sad vibes all the time man :(
        For me it was already a bittersweet song anyway. I (male v) grew super attached to Judy in my first playthrough and when that song would be on the radio it made me think of her. Then the let down happens later in her story and the song always gave me accepting-but-crushed feelings since. 😂
        What’s the name of the song?
            i really wanna stay at your house ahahaha
        I feel you
    It's like David's entire character was based on how that song feels. It hit hard in the last ep.
    :(
    I can't stop listening to it ! 😞
    I've been seeing this stated, but don't quite grasp why the song has added weight now? Just finished the show, listened to the song and read the lyrics, but just don't understand.
        I’ve connected the song to the moon scene. For me signifies how all good things come to an end but you should still pursue your goals. Bittersweet for sure
        Did you not notice the songs use in key scenes in Edgerunners? People are now linking those scenes with the song in their mind. Big Sad.
Yeah it went crazy. Amazing show.
Just finished it. Definitely one of my favorite Trigger shows alongside Kill La Kill
    Same director too.
        no wonder it's so good
Lucy is love, Lucy is life
I'm seriously surprised theres so little discussion about the show on this sub. 

It's honestly one of the best show I've seen this year.
    I’ve seen like 4-5 posts a day since it released praising the show. I haven’t seen this positive of a reception for a Netflix produced anime on this subreddit in a while.
        Trigger studio produced*
        I’m like 4 episodes in, and there’s good reason for it, might be the first time ever that the show is better than the source material in terms of video game anime adaptations
            How the turntables huh
                yep. usually with game-adapted anime we will get the usual low quality shows which always fail the source materials but this anime is a much better experience than what the game could offer.
            Very rare that those things happen. The only other one I can recall is that the author of Fight Club the book thought that Fight Club the movie had a much stronger ending.
    there was just one post because netflix release all at once
        Yeah , that kinda kills the hype . The show " Vampire in the Garden " it's short but really good as well but since Netflix releases the whole thing in one go it never really gives the shows time to become more popular through general discussion of it in the communities.
            Stranger Things is popular and that had all the episodes released at once. More like anime community isn't the best place to discuss when we are going through a blitz of post. Also need to give people time to watch it. Not everyone likes to binge watch
                Stranger things initially premiered at a time when streaming services were just becoming dominant and "Netflix Original" still was a brand that was batting 1000. The idea of dropping a season all at once was still this novel thing and it happened in a much much less saturated market. Today, there are way more shows dropping seasons all at once (And then flipping a coin to see if they're cancelled). Unless you have already got an entrenched audience from the Before Times like Stranger things, it's harder to demand attention this way anymore.
            I think the anime community is a bit too hype oriented. How do other fandoms operate around it? Video games don't have seasons, they all come out at once. So does a lot of other stuff. But discussions still happen weeks or even months after a game's release.

I think the real problem is the anime community as a whole and this sub have gotten a bit too dependent on the seasonal cycle of weekly discussion, and can't operate outside of hype and bandwagoning. By the time people have binged all the episodes of Edgerunner, the community would have already moved on to the next shiny season. It's kinda self limiting and people often forget about the stuff they were hyping just last season.
                Well, that's what happens when there's so *much* anime and so much of it is at least good (but so little is genuinely great).
                I think the biggest reason is that the majority of the anime community just moves on. There's always a new show to talk about instead.
                > Video games don't have seasons, they all come out at once. So does a lot of other stuff. But discussions still happen weeks or even months after a game's release.

Because there's more than a few hours of content in games usually.  If there isn't, then there is at least tactics and strategies, they have replay value, or the discussion just dies.

Also, games rarely come out all at once at this point.  They are either missing features that are added later or there is DLC that probably could've just been part of the original game.
                    If anime is shorter than a video game, shouldn't that make it easier for people to discuss an anime that released all at once compared to a 50+ hour game? I don't really see the difference you're trying to point out. Months have passed and people are still finding new things in Elden Ring. Similarly, in manga communities like One Piece, Attack on Titan or Made in Abyss, people are discovering new things and discussing with the community everyday.

We don't have that in the anime community, everyone's attention span only works for 12 weeks at a time. Weekly discussions are so limiting, and if I try discussing something like Vinland Saga, people are gonna be like "are we still in 2019?"
                        > Similarly, in manga communities like One Piece, Attack on Titan or Made in Abyss, people are discovering new things and discussing with the community everyday.

That's a bad example for your case. A lot of manga discussion runs around the fact that there's an ongoing cycle (weekly, monthly,...), there's a lot more One Piece discussion when there's a One Piece chapter. On the other hand, a finished manga like Monster will get mentioned about as much as its anime, once in a blue moon. 

Even AoT which still gets more discussion is mostly fuelled by the controversial ending, memes, and the upcoming final final final season.
                            Fair point. But you're kind of dismissing the AoT discussion. Do you think r/anime is gonna talk about the controversial ending months after AoT wraps up, like the manga community did? Or do you think it'll be a 1 week controversy before everyone moves onto discussing the next season?
                                Hmm I don't think we'll see threads discussing it every week, but it's something that will sink into public awareness for sure and get brought up commonly.

I'd compare it to Wonder Egg Priority. It wasn't the most popular show, but its ending still left a strong lasting effect, that it gets brought up every once in a while. I imagine AoT will have something similar, on a much larger scale, I mean already it keeps getting brought up on r/anime by manga readers.
                Isn't it the lack of marketing for anime in the west?
                Having a pinned weekly discussion thread would go a long way. People talk about batch releases killing discussion, but I think far more of the problem is their discussion forums of choice. Or more accurately that they're not forums
                Meanwhile there's me who waits for entire cours to finish and then binges them in 3 days because I'm fuckin done with cliffhangers. I appreciate Netflix cutting out the middleman.
                I mean, it's a lot easier to discuss one thing at a time rather then 12, and there needs some time to digest and analyze everything you see.
                    I see your point. But the same applies to video games. And even now, years later, I still see discussions and YouTube videos about games that came out long ago. Elden Ring came out months ago and people are still discovering and analyzing new things.

Meanwhile the anime community has a 12 week window of analysis, and after that they're already moving onto another show. For example, a show like Attack on Titan, there's just so much going on that you can't analyze that in one season. The manga community is always finding stuff that happened many chapters ago and connecting it with newer information.

Meanwhile the anime community just stops talking about it once the season ends, very few in the community dig deeper into shows long after they've finished airing. A show like Odd Taxi for example, gets better on rewatch after you know what happens in the last episode, but by that point people aren't around to discuss it anymore because the new season along with new hype trains have started.
                > Video games don't have seasons, they all come out at once. So does a lot of other stuff. But discussions still happen weeks or even months after a game's release.

Videogames are more hype based than any medium  and they discussion tends to die fairly quickly (ofc based on its length) for single player games that do not have DLC. Let's remember that the average for beating a videogame does not reach 30%.

And they do have seasons. Some are DLC for single player experiences, like cyberpunk recent boom caused by the dlc + sale of the base game, others are actually called season (gamepass included) for the game as a service trend for multiplayer games.
                >Video games don't have seasons

I mean actually a lot of the most popular video games **do** have seasons now.
                > Video games don't have seasons, they all come out at once.

*Destiny sweating profusely*
            My theory is that the weekly release schedule vs batch release is actually the smaller issue, and the big problem with batch releases is that their release often doesn't align with the start of a new season.

Conventional wisdom would dictate that you should release your show when nothing else comes out. Anime is still strongly bound to seasons though, so fans will, unsurprisingly, look for new shows when there's actually new shows to watch.

Additionally, these shows also don't get featured in Anituber seasonal recommendations, since they're not out by the time the video is made, and too old when the new season rolls around.

ReLIFE for example was a batch release that aligned with the Summer 2016 season and didn't get overlooked.
            Vampire in the garden was okay imo
            Does the opposite for a lot of people, I for one hate watching weekly and can get a lot more hyped when I can watch something as fast or as slow as I want. Weeklies just annihilates any sense of pacing to me.
            Honestly I think Edgerunners was better served by being released in a bingeable format. I think releasing weekly would have been a huge mistake with some of the big shows on the horizon. A lot of attention is going to be on stuff like Chainsaw Man and Spy X Family S2 soon.

Plus Edgerunners was really designed to be released in that format from the start and you can tell. If you were to watch it by just one episode a week it would start really, really slow and not be a good indicator of what the rest of the show is.
                Interesting opinion to be honest ,I believe that "longer exposure = more viewership " but I honestly never considered competition from heavy hitters ( this fall season is going to be bonkers)
                    Mind you I think Cyberpunk is a unique scenario with it, because its a kind of sleeper hit. I dont think pre release anyone expected it to be as good as it is.

As a fan of not only the tabletop source material, cyberpunk 2020, and the game Cyberpunk 2077, and having watched several Trigger projects. I didnt even think it'd be this good.

So if it was drawn out over a weekly schedule over the course of 10 weeks and then had to go up against Spy x Family, Chainsaw Man, etc. I just dont think it would have grabbed the traction it currently has.
        [nah, they released 10 discussion posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/xd0lld/cyberpunk_edgerunners_episode_10_discussion/) but there is a good chance they just got lost in the shuffle.
        nah bruh saw alot of post about this show on MAL stop the cap and shut up with this weekly shit it old
    One of the top series of the season for me. Also the shortest amount of episodes I've ever needed to get so attached to the characters.

Absolute banger anime.
        Episode one, ok I’m bingeing this. It was 2am so kindda passed out and only have 2 episodes left, already dreading the end cuz I’m going to want more. 

The world, the characters, the animation, the music, this anime is one of the best I’ve seen in a very long time.
    netflix exclusive that was released all at once
    It's a video game adjacent adaptation. I hear all the time that the Dragon Quest anime is incredible, but I've never seen a single person talk about it here despite its popularity in Japan.
        that has less to do with the fact the origin is video game, and more to do with dragon quest not being that popular outside of Japan
            Well everyone outside of Japan should stop being snobs and play Dragon Quest then.
                I feel like every gamer should play at least one Dragon Quest game in thier lives, there's just something about it that hits different despite being so traditional.

Thankfully Dragon Quest 11 is on basically every platform now, with only the PS4 not having the definitive edition. 

Considering the games have changes platforms constantly, right now is arguably the easiest it has ever been to get into the series-esspecially since DQ11 is one of the best.
                [deleted]
                    I respectfully disagree. Toriyama style also works well for Dragon Quest.
                For those that like jrpgs, sure. But that genre is niche so you can not expect all kind of players to try it.
        Dragon Quest Adventure of Dai has been a favorite of mine as of late, truly the best reboot anime aside from Fruits Basket.

It's almost over, and I'm sort of sad to see it go.

Also Popp, Hyunkel, Hadlar, and of course, Dai have all become some of my favorite characters.

Popp in particular is an example of some of the best character growth I have ever seen on an anime.

It is a *crime* that more people aren't watching it, or haven't been watching it for so long when it is about to end at episode 100.
    I’m not too big on the story like everyone else seems to be I still liked it tho. For me it kinda drops after episode 6 picks up a bit and then the ending kinda just ends.
        I'm in complete agreement with you. It's so visually appealing to watch but the story is fairly messy and doesn't make a ton of sense at points. Like it was trying to be deeper in its plot than it actually really was or even needed to be which just made it super confusing to follow at times. Especially at the end where it sometimes went from Point A to Point C without exploring Point B (without getting too spoiler heavy, Feredey and Kiwi's talk about Lucy in the beginning of Episode 9 really irked me and made no sense whatsoever; makes it hard to know or follow the story they were presenting when they pull stuff out of their ass like that). Should've just kept it simple instead of going for some grand script they couldn't quite deliver on.
            What was the grand script? It was a fairly simple story.
    > I'm seriously surprised theres so little discussion about the show on this sub. 

So little? I've seen at least one post a day reach front page of the sub with hundreds of comments since the release date.
    There is.....
There were 11 megathreads the day it released.
    The subtitle Edge Runners was a mistake I think, it makes it sound like a Blade Runner parody!
Also amazing intro with Franz Ferdinand Banger
I finished it this morning... oh..my..god I was blown away. This is the type of anime that'll get you to speed home from class to watch more. The style, animation, and music was all 10/10. I think I'm gonna go home and watch it again lol.

I relate so hard to you feeling empty asf lol. It's a shame we don't get stuff like this more often. It gave me a feeling of excitement for something I haven't felt in such a long time.
    me too man me too and once again i think you are spot on with the way you have put it. really looking forward to the next one which should happen from the reception it has gotten 😄
    yep, i skipped school today for this show
    I know... So short nice and short
It really did come out of nowhere and become my favorite anime of the season. It had no right being as good as it was and I really hope we get more of it.
    To be fair, the cyberpunk universe/lore provides a lot to work with.

With how seriously CD project red takes their games' lore, I would've been surprised if the anime ended up subpar. My expectations weren't insanely high, but I wasn't expecting it to be bad either.
        I think Cyber Punk was already an established law before CDPR brought out the half arsed game same with witchery
            No, the game has all new lore, and the anime uses that. The story itself was written by CDPR.

2020 called though, they want their hater bandwagon back.
                They scammed me as well as a lot of others I've got a right to be a hater I think
                    > They scammed me

How did they scam you? I mean, you definitely waited until it released and reviews came out before buying, right? Certainly you didn't pre-pay for a product that doesn't exist solely on the faith that a company wouldn't fuck up, right?

They released a bad product, but they didn't scam you.
                    You're one of those that dreamed up a perfect GTA clone and got mad when you didn't get it? Okay.
                        Yeah that's right completely dismiss the valid reason I have to dislike the company. It was a shit show I'm glad they've not given up on it completely but when you scam your customers you reap what you sow
                            You're free to dislike the game and the company. But most people calling them scammers are complaining about promises that were never made or features that were explicitly cut before release.
                                [deleted]
                                    The game ran like shit on previous gen and deserves all the criticism, but the game itself was great on PC and next gen.

You're free to dislike the game, I don't really care about anyone's opinion tbh, what irks me is the fact that people like you keep bringing up promises that were never made, like GTA sandbox features, when the game is very obviously a story driven RPG.

You said It here, the features you "expected". Just because the game takes place in a city, doesn't mean It's meant to be a sandbox like GTA. People dreamed up a game and got mad when their fantasy didn't become reality.
                        I love Cyberpunk but this isn’t a fair assessment, they quite clearly marketed it as a perfect GTA clone; I’m not gonna say that all the backlash that CDPR got was warranted but a good chunk of it definitely was
                            No, it wasn't, at all. If you watched clickbait videos dreaming up the ultimate game, maybe. But this was always an RPG first, like the Witcher. This is what I'm talking about.

Edit: A guy commented and instantly blocked me about this. Holy shit, you people have some issues.
                                The RPG side of CP2077 is the worst aspect of it lmfao. 

You're dickriding way too much, I'm sorry your game failed and they had to spend 2 years making it decent. I'm sorry you're only getting 1 dlc before they jump ship to Witcher 4. I'm sorry you have to sit out here running defense for a company that will never care about you.
        To be faaaiiirrrr🎶
    It had every right to be as good as it was, TRIGGER has been making bangers since they formed as a company after Gainax shit the bed.
Now all they have to do is resist the urge to make a live-action adaptation.
    Instead of a remake if they make a live action show with an original story in same universe it can be interesting like first season of Altered Carbon which was great.
    A live action cyberpunk would be amazing. It'd also be really fuckin' expensive.

I'd be ok with 3DCG Cyberpunk show... get some UE5 in there, some real time rendering, with advanced mocap tech, some livecapture facial action, and they could produce something visually stunning, relatively quickly once the pipeline is setup that would definetly scratch the itch... and it'd even actually positively contribute towards CDProjekt's move into UE5 as they develop the sequel in that engine.

It doesn't have to be Arcane quality, or even Edgerunners quality - but it could still work really well with the level of animation quality found in the original Cyberpunk.
    I mean... When all this talk started of a CP show, I was hoping for a "live action". Was initially disappointed finding out it was going to be an anime. I like anime, just didn't think that would be the medium at first. 

I do agree though about making an adaptation of the anime being a bad idea.
Studio trigger and cyberpunk setting. It’s a perfect match.
Surprisingly, excellent directors make excellent media.

Anime hasn't been doing a lot for me lately.  I often feel like I've grown up and it hasn't.  *Edgerunners* allowed me to experience anime the way I did when I was a teenager again.  

"Boy meets girl" stories are a big barrier to entry for me.  Anime has a couple of different variations of this trope, such as the girl being naked-on-arrival, the girl having the body of a prepubescent child, or the girl having the mind of a prepubescent child.  Needless to say these aren't flattering trends to have to describe.  Edgerunners falls into a somewhat more benign varient, where the woman the protagonist crosses paths with is cool and distant, almost intimidating, acting as the catalyst for his growth.  It's not as icky as the others, but it still deeply fatigues me.  I want to be able to inhabit stories in roles *other* than as "catalysts," prizes, and accessories to the male main character. 

And, for a much shorter aside, I prefer what 2077 did with cyberpsychosis over what the TTRPG and Edgerunners did with the concept.  77 allows for more empathetic stories, with a less Faustian bent.

All that out of the way, I still enjoyed it immensely more than anything else I've consumed in recent memory.  Imaishi is a talented storyteller, and it was easy to overlook my reservations and immerse myself in it.

I also really hope it directs more attention to the game, which as I understand has seen significant improvements.  The situation with the investors who went nuclear on CDPR to force a premature xmas release was beyond unfortunate, and 2077 deserves better than to only be known for its shaky launch.
    What a gonk.

/S
    YES EXACTLY, the female characters in this story are very one dimensional, Lucy is a very flat character that is just akward virgin male bait and kiwi's motivations don't exist she just did what she did for money I guess???

And if they're going to have a beauty like Lucy fall for David so quickly, why give him the personality of a potato? At least write him with more charisma so it's believable. 

Otherwise it's the best anime since arcane(which is an anime fight me)
        You nailed it.

Like, I get it.  I *honestly* do; as a woman, I'm socialized to empathize with men in media.  The character archetype Lucy belongs to is a salve designed to address male insecurities about not feeling special, unique, or important.

While I'm sure it's incredibly helpful to young men to see characters like that in media, and work through (and/or languish in) that insecurity in the shared mediaspace, to me it's kinda boring.  And repetitive.  And honestly more depressing the more you think about it.  

Because the takeaway message for me and other women is kind of the opposite.  That I *am* special, but my special calling is to have some boy glom onto me like an imprinted duckling, at which point, I become solely responsible for his social development. 

I just wish filmmakers cared about my insecurities this much.  

I still liked Edgerunners a lot.  Imaishi is REALLY good at his job.  But I would have liked to like it just a little bit more.
    >  the girl having the body of a prepubescent child

RIP Becca
        I'm... actually not going to go bluehairedfeminist on Becca.  

Maybe I could, maybe I should, maybe you expect me to, maybe **not** having anything to say about Becca reflects poorly of me to all the other cool feminists, but nah.  Got nothing. 

Thought she was a short young adult.  

Maybe if it was Melissa Fahn or Christina "Vee" Valenzuela's voice and not Alex Cazares, I might have had a different reaction.  But Alex's performance really sells a sense of lived frustration with her body and how her presentation prehudices others that's festered for 20+ years.

Some adults are just short.  I'm not mad about this one. 

I'm more annoyed that she "competes" for the affection of the audience surrogate character.  I'm kind of over that trope, feel like I've gotten more than a lifetime's fill.
Spoilers, but I'd say a direct continuation isn't impossible. They could always continue it with Lucy if they wanted to, but also Adam Smasher says "you would make an interesting Construct" to David before he blows his brains out off-camera. 

If you've played Cyberpunk 2077, you'd know that Arasaka really likes to take dead people and turn them into data called a 'construct' which is like their soul digitized. That's what Johnny Silverhand becomes after Smasher shoots him and he's captured by Arasaka. So Smasher could've killed David, taken his body to Arasaka HQ, created a soul construct, and now David is locked in Arasaka's hellish soul prison. A second season could be about Lucy freeing David's construct, or David being brought back to life using the construct by either Arasaka, or someone else who might steal the construct. 

But also it might be best to just end the story of David Martinez and Lucy and follow a new crew, or even do a 2077 adaptation. The lore world is so big and interesting, they could really do just about whatever they want.
    [deleted]
        X2 don't
    Nah, he's dead. Even if Arsaka do make him a construct, he should be a part of Alt by the end of the game since Alt destroys Mikoshi and absorbs all the constructs / engrams. At the very best, you can say that David migt be alive, but is now a part of a rogue AI in cyberspace.
It definitely a wild anime kill la kill vibes. Leaves you wanting more from something with nothing left
    >Leaves you wanting more from something with nothing left 

Holy shit, this describes it perfectly!
    Is kill la kill like cowboy bebop? Like this one.. Short.. I mean
I played CP2077 and I really liked the anime overall; there were nods and references I was pleasantly surprised by. The ending fucking broke me though.
    > The ending fucking broke me though.

The back half of the series was like coming down.

Everything's "good" and "fun" and then it all starts going to shit. You want to go back, and recapture the magic but all you can do is grit your teeth and plow forward to the end.

What a wild ride.
        Yes…yes.
    I was part of the day 1 wave and decided to wait till they fixed it. Now I wanna go back to playing it again
        Yoooo same here, was caught up in some bugs in the first 24-48 hours and then told myself i'll come back in a week/month when they fix things up. 

Not sure why I haven't got back too either....
            Feel like shit that I preordered a PS4 disk version...
    The game has quite the unfortunate abbreviation.
        Can't unsee it now.
Trigger masterclass
    masterclass indeed mate, need to check out the other ones now ahahaha
    I don't mean to undermine Trigger's work but they only worked on animation and character design and got approved from CdPR. Ost, story was all from CDPR writers. Witcher 3 writer did the story for this.
        The story is by CDPR but the rest of the show (including the script) is full Trigger and if you've seen Imaishi's other work, it's very similar.
        If they worked on it, theyre part of the team. So the credit definitely goes to Trigger.  


Besides, the production team has the final call on how to translate script to animation.
        > they only worked on animation and character design and got approved from CdPR. Ost, story was all from CDPR writers.

I mean you do remind people of CDPR's involvement on the project which I appreciate, but the split of work you present here is much harsher than it is in reality.

The original story is definitely from CDPR's side, but as other people have mentioned, Trigger was involved already on the script. Simply going by the opening credits we have:

From CDPR: Mike Pondsmith credited on creation of the Cyberpunk 2077 universe, another creation credit on Rafal Jaki, while the screen story is credited on Bartosz Sztybor.

From Trigger: Both creators credited on script, Masahiko Otsuka and Yoshiki Usa, are Trigger adjacent, and Hiromi Wakabayashi who is credited for "creative support" has always been involved on the narrative side of Trigger productions.

Of course, credits can often give a fairly vague idea of what the tasks ultimately were, but [this video](https://streamable.com/goylj2) linked on this thread demonstrates that Trigger already influenced the story in such central aspects as the composition of the main cast of the story. Also, to my understanding the anime uses songs from the franchise, but the ost itself is by Akira Yamaoka (no prior association to either company) and sound director, the person who along with director decides on the usage of soundtrack, is Hiroki Urakari, who has worked previously in Trigger projects.

Of course, another paragraph could be made on CDPR creators' involvement on the visual side - and *even a longer, slightly hypocritical one* could be made on how crediting different aspects of creative works on companies rather than individuals isn't ideal in general.

Anyway, the fundamental tl;dr point was that things aren't that black and white.
        Writer for the game right? Because I don't see the author getting into something like this.
            Yes witcher 3 the wild hunt. The author only did the books
        It was visually stunning as expected tho. They know what they can do and they do it well
        I might watch this then, with the comfort of knowing aliens won't show up 2 episodes before the end.
        source?

    Saving anime but yet again
I was really surprised how good it was. I was sad to see it end.
I was brought to tears when the last song started playing. This show brought pain and pleasure in a way I just wasn't anticipating. And I loved every fucking minute. See you on the moon...
Haven’t seen a Trigger anime this good since Star Wars: Visions
    Truly one of their anime of all time.
        I lost it when David said "So you guys... are Cyberpunks"
            I got goosebumps when he said "it's edgerunnin' time!"
                Best line was when he said he was built different
                    Im glad im not the only one that that line stood out to
                    The best part is I'm pretty sure several of these lines actually did get said and non of it made me roll my eyes.
                    my friends all lost it at that line, had to pause our viewing party to laugh for a good minute
                That line was never actually said unlike the other two lines.  
The real line was "it's edgin' time"
    Trigger saving anime one show at a time https://streamable.com/goylj2
        What, they wanted to cut Rebecca?  So glad Trigger held their ground on this.
        Hey what is this from? I'm curious to watch more.
            They did a stream the day before release streaming the first 3 episodes and some discussion. Unfortunately the vod is gone now so you'll have to search if someone reuploaded it somewhere, I had a quick look and didn't find it but it's probably out there somewhere.
        [deleted]
            Reminds me how in the VN VA-11 Hall-A which also has a cyberpunk setting there's a character who's a sex worker android and she chose to stay with her younger body not getting an upgrade to appeal to that certain "market". It's weird but thinking about it of course there's be shit like this...
    I mean... Star wars visions was literally their last show before cyberpunk...
        I think that might be the joke.
            Then Woosh on me
                I don't want to whoosh on you. Only when the time.... Is right.
    They wanted their own Arcane so they made Edgerunners
        I mean, both are great
        Odd take.
Real question tho, should I watch it dub or sub? English feels more "right" to the world, but it's an  anime through and through so im not sure

Edit: Thanks for the replies, I watched half of the first episode both in dub and sub and definitely felt the dub more. I'm ESL so I watch everything with eng subs anyway, it was interesting to see the other little changes beside removing the slang between them.
    The dub is pretty high quality in my opinion, and I usually can't stand watching dubs. There is also certain slang from the game ("choom", "preem" etc.) that are subtitled, but they don't actually have that kind of lingo in Japanese, so if you listen for that kind of thing then you'll notice it. In my opinion, even if the Japanese version is the "original" version, it kinda feels like it was made for English. But the Japanese acting is great too if you just prefer it.

The real problem is that the subtitles are apparently not good; I did not check them but they are apparently full of straight-up errors, as if it were transcribed by a machine (which gets especially bad when it comes to the slang).
        Oh yeah the street lingo is def something that works better with EN since it was originally written in EN.
        I'm definitely not someone that's familiar with Japanese, but even I can say the subs are total shit in some scenes. 

Half the calls they make don't even translate properly, I don't know which call but I'm pretty sure the whole convo goes very differently from what the on-screen text (call hologram) shows. 

That said, you're pretty much going to understand it all if you're a regular anime sub watcher.
        I haven't checked but apparently the English captions for the English dub have been fixed. Also, there are seperate english subtitles that are meant for the Japanese dub, which don't have those errors.
            The separate subtitles for the Japanese dub still suck.
        Also, the dub has Giancarlo Esposito. Nuff said.
        Need to hear Giancarlo's sexy voice too!
        It's also all the different accents too. NC is incredibly diverse and that shines through much better in the dub imo.
    Dub cast is stacked, I'd watch dubbed first and sub after.
    the setting and culture dictates eng dub is the best way to watch it.
    English for sure, subs would distract from the amazing visuals and I've heard the subs have some translation issues with some of the uniquely named stuff. Plus it takes place in America so everyone speaks English anyway, there's also a lot of different accents as night city is very varied, not sure how those are in the sub.
        Rewatched in Dub recently. I haven't said this in a LONG time, but the Dub is just objectively far better than the sub for the reasons that you've already mentioned. 

And as you already said, this anime is extremely well made and it's a crime how much the subs distract you. Generally it's the ground or whatever uninteresting stuff that's there at the bottom of the screen, but edgerunners made the fucking street garbage look world class.

Like what the fuck Studio Trigger? xD

Amazing experience, still in the high from when it released.
        There are two characters that don't speak English. Which is even funnier in the Japanese dub because the subtitles just say "in japanese" despite everyone speaking japanese.
    I watched the dub version and 1 ep of sub (jp). For me the dub was better. But overall anyway you watch it it will be good. 


I disliked last ep though. But thats my personal exp.
    I watched ep 1 in both. Voice acting is great for both versions, but the sketchy subs, plus it just felt "right" to watch it in english, as an english speaker. And I usually always watch subs.
    If someone tells you they preferred the sub for this it's a plain giveaway they're trying very hard to look like they have the "correct" opinion about dubs vs subs, honestly this feels like it was written in English and there's a Japanese dub.
        Damn people can't have preferences anymore.
            Lol you miss the point
        I was shocked to see that the Japanese was the original cause until I saw that, I was under the impression of the opposite lol
        The jaoanese voice acting was fine but the subs were absolute garbage and at times made no sense at all.
            The actors themselves are great, but so were the English VAs, and English felt more natural in night city.
        Lmao, or you're a fast reader and it doesn't detract in any way to listen to the originally cast va's
            I can literally speak fluent Japanese. English is the way to go here. The English cast is objectively better, and hearing them use similarish words in Japanese to what the real script obviously is (aka cyberpunk lingo) is just bad
                That's nice, but I've heard both, and the Japanese VA is strictly better imo. David especially, his English VA is flat as fuck. Rebecca is also 1000 times better jp
    English. VA is top notch
    English dub due to the extensive slang lingo used in the anime.
    It's probably the strongest dub I've seen in years. I think it helps that it was written in english first so it feels way more natural than a lot of dubbed anime since it doesn't have to try and translate the lines from another lanuage and then rewrite that so it works within the lipflaps of the animation.

But even aside from that the subtitle track is just fucking awful, it feels like we're reading the results of something that was translated from english to japanese, then back to english by a different guy. There's also lots of errors too.
I fell in love with Lucy. I really liked her style and everything. And then that final episode, oh man.
    Becca for me, best girl unrequited love.
        Dude she did not deserve to go out like that. Like out of everyone I think she got the rawest deal. At least the main two got a period of raw bliss. Sure they were worried about each other, but they had it. Same with Maine and Dopio. Becca got sold out by her friend (which ultimately lead to all their deaths), while dealing with the grief of her brother’s death and unrequited love for a guy that she has to watch die in order to save someone else.
I thought the plot was a bit predictable and the villains where underwhelming, but the animation, directing and dialogue were pretty good, all around a pretty fun anime that didn't overstay its welcome.
    There's only one real narrative rule in the Cyberpunk handbook and it's been consistent this whole time, there are no happy endings in Night City.
    The biggest villian in this anime is the Night City itself. And its masterfully done
        The biggest villain in this anime is late stage capitalism
        Maybe if you add the context from the game, but I don't think that it was that well conveyed in the anime (specially give that it was a short story), maybe if becomes an anthology series they could flesh out that more, but as an anime only I don't see it.
            I thought it was well conveyed and I've never played the game. I got it the moment [Edgerunners spoilers]>!David's mom was processed and forgotten about like a used soda tin can!<
    Adam Smasher dying to a few quickhacks in cyberpunk 2077 made him look really silly in the show for me lol
        I still can't believe his level caps at 30 unless you're doing the "Don't fear the Reaper" route
        Despite seeing a bunch of similar comments to this he feels absolutely menacing to someone who just started the game after watching the show.
            theyve buffed him up quite abit in the newest update
        V is a pretty much a monster at the end of the game, it's kinda funny with the silent takedown V just unplug Adam smasher to death tho.
    The predictability is very much intentional. I knew it was going to happen and it crushed me to watch David gradually lose it after the time skip. Really reinforced the connection to his character.
    Yeah that's what I thought. Story wasn't bad by any means, but it was predictable and the pacing was messy at times. 

That being said the animation, soundtrack, and general atmosphere of the show were fantastic. Had a lot of fun with it and it's one of my favorite of the year.
    Honestly the only unpredictable thing is how it ends but it’s more like a “oh that’s it” for me.
This anime reminded me of akame ga kill but done right
    Lmfao my biggest pet peeve with that shit show was that the Mc wore a fucking sweater the whole time . Everyone else had like armor or assassin shit but that lamo had a Ned Flanders ass sweater.
        [deleted]
            What's the point of armor in a show where characters can cleave through iron like it's paper.
I'm just thinking about what canon V is like after seeing David with the cyberskeleton and still losing to Smasher
    With Dont fear the reaper route dude literally solo the arasaka hq and just unplug Adam smasher cables
        Don't fear the reaper route is best ending for real, the second V grabbed Johnny's hand and the silverhand theme kicks in. doom music vibes
    We don't actually know if V did though. I mean, for all we know, dying in don't fear the reaper route could be cannon
[removed]
    Its annoying that on these bring hype to a new anime post someone has to write spoiler in them
    Right? Someone buy that girl a David Martinez on the rocks and a bag of Moonchies!
Is it like its own thing or does it resemble triggers normal shows where it seems like everything is hyped up on too much caffeine with insane fast pacing and hyperness?
    It's fast-paced, but it's not *quite* the usual Trigger insanity. It actually felt a lot more like an old-school GAINAX show than a Trigger one to me, honestly.

e: Like, if you've seen the Buster OVAs (Gunbuster and Diebuster) and you thought those had alright pacing and weren't too hyperactive, you'll be good with Edgerunners.
        That’s good too hear! I haven’t watched those but I probably should as I always hear good things about them
        I've never encountered another person who's seen Diebuster in the wild.
            It's incredibly underseen and more people need to watch it.
                What's about
    It's not... not those things. If you're at all familiar with Imaishi his trademarks are all there.

It's significantly more intense in tone, though, so it's a very different experience than anything they've made before.
    CDPR did the story so Trigger's pacing of the show doesn't get applied here. They only animated it
        Scene pacing is definitely very imaishi. At the end of the day the director has a huge input on pacing and storytelling no matter the script.
            Trigger also has script writing credit, so it's difficult to say who did what and how much
    Not quite on the level of their other works, I'd say about 50% sugar level for what they usually do — which is still a lot. But it comes off more as a hyper-stylized anime more so than a Trigger-happy anime, which is saying something.
Duuuuuude, I've been an anime fan for the better part of 20 years and I never expected a Netflix anime adaption of a game IP to be so fucking good that it makes it into my top 15. 

\-This show was fucking amazing, I NEEED MOREEEEEE
    Then go and watch Arcane aswell. Masterclass above CP77
        I have, I enjoyed the soundtrack and writing but couldn't really get behind the art style as much as CP77, Trigger did a phenomenal job.
        i prefer edgerunners over arcane, though theyre both great. edgerunners soundtrack shits all over arcanes sountrack tho, having to listen to imagine dragons in pivotal scenes made me irrationally mad
            Yeah indeed.
    Play the game . Also , Dorohedoro , Komi, Baki, Castlevanias, Devilman Crybaby , Blue Period , High Score Girl. Hell even arcane that technically is an anime.... Netflix makes some good ass shows .
        Dorohedoro criminally underrated.

&#x200B;

also Baki Enjoyer = Based + chadpilled
            What is dorohoro about
                It's... hard to explain but basically it's about this guy named Kaiman, an amnesic man disfigured by Magic who tries to recover both his original face and memories about his past.

And the adventures he encounters trying to reach that point.

This link explains the plot better:

https://dorohedoro.fandom.com/wiki/Dorohedoro
        Arcane, Castlevania are not anime, japanese studios didn't produce them. They don't have entries on anime db's like mal etc.
            According you
                According to me, anime community and definition of what "Anime" is. Go check any Anime DB and see what entries they have registered, you won't find these but cyberpunk is there coz Trigger a jp studio produced it.
                    >According to me

Worthless 

>anime community and definition of what "Anime" is.

There is no consensus, stupid .

>Go check any Anime DB and see what entries they have registered,

I won't,  that shit ain't an anime authority. 

Don't reply kid , I could only care for your opinion if I were getting paid to hear it .
                        You're just a dumbass baboon with 2 braincells
                Hell even just check this place r/anime, there are no discussion threads or anything, that should tell your dumb brain something.
        >Castlevanias, Devilman Crybaby

Ooooohhh, you've got a point there. These are two of my recent favorites too. That said, Edgerunners even blows them out of the water IMO. Maybe its just a perfect storm scenario as it appeals to so many of my anime and anime adjacent interests. 

\-Ah yeah, definitely. I just bought it. It's actually going for 50% off on the PS Store atm
It’s actually good? I might have to watch it huh. (For real, no sarcasm right?)
    I’m not finished yet, but I’m really enjoying that show
        Nice. I like Arcane and that love death robot too. So I guess this can be a good sign.
            Okay now I finished the show and I just dont know what to say. In my opinion the show is really well made and definitly worth a watch. The Animation, the soundtrack and the characters are just perfect. And I really agree with OP, now I’m feeling empty
                welcome to the club homie ;(
            mate watch it, it is top class and am jealous you are getting to watch it for the first time :(
I went in with 0 expectations and man what a show. I also did English dub and it was actually really well done. Very notable VAs delivering lines exceptionally. Tried jp dub and while it's not bad It just doesn't give off the same impact that English has. Would highly recommend the show.
I am so EMO right now after finished the ending💀💀💀my poor lucy nooo😭😭😭
And dubs the way to go.  Gotta get that Giancarlo Esposito action.
    But the original has Kurosawa Tomoyo (Kumiko/Phos) as Rebecca!
        And Aoi Yuuki and Kenjiro Tsuda. Both sub and dub have amazing actors behind them.
    I was switching between the sub and dub for the first 10 min because the sub felt weird for me.

The dubbed was the way to go.
Anime of the year
    Agreed. Hell, even people who doesn't like anime are praising it. That alone is saying a lot.
        Nah, that just means cyberpunk 2077 fans are also watching.
        Pretty sure that just means cyberpunk fans are watching it.
            I'm both an anime and a cyberpunk fan. I'd say edgerunners is better than ghost in the shell 2045.
                That’s not a high bar tho.
                    Hey there's not much cyberpunk genre. I'll take what I can get. At long as it entertains me I'm happy. No need to set high bars for my entertainment.
    Competition is stiff but definitely up there
    Laughs in Chainsaw Man.
        It’s not even out yet lol
            bout to
                Has every opportunity to be shit and every opportunity to be one of the best anime in recent history, so let's wait before we keep building up expectations.
                    if mappa screw this up somehow they're basically dead so i wouldn't worry too much
                        Lol business doesn't work like that
        The stuff that makes CSM AOTY material probably won’t be adapted this year
        Laugh in Fall 2022
    It might have been anime of the year, but there are a few glaring issues with this show.  First, the subtitles were absolute shit.  Some  straight up not translated correctly at all with spelling errors to boot.  How you gonna pay millions of dollars for an anime to be produced and totally butcher the subs?  Also there are just too many great animes that have come out in 2022 that makes it hard for me to give this one anime of the year.  Demon slayer, AOT, and kaguya sama were all amazing, plus all the amazing fall animes like my hero or bleach.  It was good, but not anime of the year imo.
        Subtitles are hell and seem to be written by someone who doesn't know what's going on in the show. Major errors such as them -> she or other such errors which make you confused about who is taking about whom.  A lot of slang wasn't even subtitled properly and I'm watching English dub -> english subtitles, and it's not even internally consistent.  I was initially watching Japanese language with English subtitles but gave up because the Japanese script and English subtitles had so much divergence.  
  
For best effects, watch English language, English subs.
            I saw a rumor (so take with a grain of salt) that the official subs are just the script for the dub, which is why they don't make a whole lot of sense.
                Well...as the poster above you outlined, the dub was completely different than the subtitles portrayed. Things almost never lined up. So things would have had to change a LOT for the dub from scripting phase, more than usual.
    nah, let's no get ahead of overselves
    There's still Chainsaw man to compete against it.
        I already read the manga, it's an 8/10
            Edgerunners wasn't all that much either tbh, for me it lacked a good villain/antagonist, and the plot was a bit predictable, still pretty fun though.
            Story wise it might fall a tad short of cyberpunk but the animation they showed off for the trailer definitely should make you hold off judgement till afterwards.
                Fair enough
    Nah, Lycoris Recoil, Spy x Family and Class of the elite 2 are better.

Visually CP77:ED would be deff win and it should.
        Nah, if you said Kaguya-sama, Summertime Render or Made in Abyss, I wouldn't have flat out denied. But these aren't that great, especially COTE 2.
But hey, everyone's entitled to their own opinions.
            I'd throw Summer Time Render, MiA and maybe SxF above Cyberpunk, but not Kaguya, Lyco Reco and certainly not CotE2. 

But that's what great about anime, everybody has their own opinion and that's ay okay. Also just goes to show how absolutely stacked this year has been.
                I thought everyone loved Kaguya-sama season 3, damn that's a surprise. SxF isn't really a contender for me tbh. We still got Mob Psycho, Chainsaw Man, and Golden Kamuy (actually the only one that I think might top Cyberpunk at this point) for fall.
                    I didn't dislike Kaguya, I thought it was really good. I just preferred the other shows I mentioned. 

I've given MiA, Kaguya, SxF, STR and Cyberpunk all 9s on MAL actually.
                        I'm not knocking on the ranking going on in this thread, but I don't know if it's fair to rank the anime like that as they all have different styles, different genres. For instance Spy Family vs Cyberpunk. How is a fair comparison to be made.... It's hard. Like asking whether Aliens is a better movie than Titanic...
                            Yeah for sure, comparing apples to oranges. I just try to rank it in terms of overall enjoyment. Like "that was one of the tastiest apples or juiciest steaks" like Cyberpunk was a fantastic sci-fi, but comparing it to SxF doesn't really make sense unless you rank it by overall enjoyment in comparison with others in its genre.
                                Yes agree with you. But it ranks up up there for sure. I'd been slightly disappointed this summer anime... Until now! Holy shit this anime is good.
                    Oh, and there's also Bleach and a re-airing of the (decent) Berserk movies in an episodic format with added and polished scenes. Great time to be an anime fan.
            Genuine question what exactly are you saying is better about cyberpunk compared to those shows? I get animation and entertainment but I can’t imagine you’re talking about the story or characters.
        COTE is absolute trash lol
        I've watched spyxfamily and while it does everything right, it doesn't do anything new or exciting.
        Nah, if you said Kaguya-sama, Summertime Render or Made in Abyss, I wouldn't have flat out denied. But these aren't that great, especially COTE 2.
But hey, everyone's entitled to their own opinions.
    Anime of the goddamn *century.*
        Idk about that bud
            I was being a little hyperbolic, but honestly, now that I'm sitting down and thinking about it... there's like, only a *scattered few* things post-2000 that I'd say are better than this. FLCL, Spirited Away, Mushishi, Samurai Champloo, and Kemonozume are about it, and I would honestly go "yeah, fair" at anyone who put Edgerunners above those.

Edgerunners isn't just good, it's one of the fucking all-time GOATs.
                Again, Idk about that bud
                Watch more lmao.

Madoka Magica, Steins;Gate, Shinsekai Yori are better just off the top of my head.
                    Madoka and Shinsekai Yori are up there in the same zone too, yeah, I just forgot about them.

Steins;Gate is good, but not GOAT candidate good, I feel like.
                        I feel the exact opposite. Madoka was great, but not better than Steins Gate. And Shinsekai Yori was decent but the pacing was messy.
i am so sad about the ending honestly
finished it at one day but  at what cost...
    pain, just pain
should i play the game or the watch the anime first for a better experience?
    The show has a lot of Easter eggs from the game. It'll definitely enhance the experience, but your milage may vary since the game does take quite some time to finish. It is a RPG after all, so expect playtime to be dozens of hours.
        The show is cannon. It has been said in the reveal last week.
            Yep. CDPR also added some Edgerunners easter eggs in the game in the recent patch so it's 100% canon.
        To be fair, most of the value of the game can be had playing it for a few hours - enough to let the feeling and sights of night city soak in before you go watch it.

Then you go back and play the game and be like - Oh shit, I've seen this from the anime.
        [deleted]
            Not equally though. There's a lot of important characters/locations from the game that show up very briefly in the anime. You wouldn't remember them when playing the game if you watched the anime first, but you would notice them in the anime if you played the game first. 

Like Rogue shows up for 2 seconds in the anime, purely there as an easter egg for people who played the game.
    nah it’s a prequel and there is some easter egg
    The anime takes place before the game so you can watch it first.
    Same world, but completely separate stories. Don't need to play the game to enjoy the show.
    I think show>game>show is the way to go...if you like rpg's that is. It's probably 30ish hours to blast through the main story and maybe 90-110 hours to 100%. There's tons of good side content to find and cool things to see so it doesn't feel like a chore to do everything.
    Not really, it's a separate story but they share the same setting and some of the people in the game are in the show but it's not super relevant to the story.
    Show is canon but it does it justice. No need to play the game to understand the show.
Fucking amazing show, haven’t watched a ton of anime but easily the best one I’ve seen. 

I’ve never watched anything that respects it’s source material/universe this much.
I just started watching it yesterday and I. Was. Hooked. The graphics, the voice actors, the MUSIC.
It might be my most favorite anime of all time. I'm a long time fan of the game and this anime was everything I was hoping for and more. It's so god damn good I couldn't stop watching it and binged it all at once. I was immediately sad afterwards, not only because of that brutal ending, but also the post anime depression kicking in immediately. I'm still suffering and wanting more. I'm also relieved it's so good because now more people will try the game. It's come a long way since launch and while it's still far from perfect I'd love to see more people experience it.
    really well put as well. im left with a hole in me too right now that i dont know how to fill and other animes aren’t doing the job :( truly a one of a kind anime and i agree with you in the game too. ive really started enjoying it recently and with the references such as the calling sound and hacking noises it just makes you want to play but every time i listen to really want to stay at your house and let you down i just feel depressed man especially when she was jogging through her memories at the end 😭😭
*minor spoiler here, don't read if u haven't finished the anime yet.

The scene where David goes to back up Maine, and Maine tells him to live on, then goes out in an absolute blaze of glory, then later David does the same for Lucy to live on, so epic and beautifully written. It made me straight up cry lol.
A collaboration of eastern animation and western storytelling could only mean two things.. its either a trash or a masterpiece.. this is obviously the latter
    One of the very very few Netflix adaptations that work. This one hit it out of the park.
I was going to make a post just like this. I feel like cyberpunk is the anime I've been waiting for. It was so refreshing and unique compared to all the other anime I've seen. Everything from animation to gore, to pacing, to soundtrack was immaculate. Characters getting their just deserves, loved it. For someone who has a.d.d, 
pacing is huge to me. Lots of anime and/or movies either drag the character development too long and it gets boring, or there isn't enough development so u don't care who lives and dies. This anime had the perfect balance of drama, action, character/plot development, like I couldn't point out anything to say it'd be better if they did this... Can't wait for season 2
    >I feel like cyberpunk is the anime I've been waiting for.

That's probably because it's written by a western director. I love anime but I had the same "revelation" when arcane came out. If you are used to anime writing and the way anime portrays characters and their interactions shows like edgerunner feel very different. The mature romance in this is something you rarely ever get in anime and to me it's a big part why the ending of the show is more impactful.
        I wouldn't say mature romance in anime is all that rare, it's just that a lot of romance in anime tends to be *adolescent* romance. Anime with adult casts tend to be a bit more mature about how they handle romance. Cyberpunk Edgerunners fell on the adult cast side of the spectrum so the romance element was mature.
    absolutely mate top class this was and was not expecting this at all. im so glad others feel the same way as this in my eyes is a masterclass from the animating of trigger to cd’s writing and the references from the game also add to this phenomenal anime. i sadly personally dont think we will get a season 2 of edgerunner and i hope i am wrong but i am looking forward to whatever the next step in arc and characters for cyberpunks anime presents 😁
        I'd been watching rather disappointing anime all summer and this one was a total breath of fresh air, that left me all shook up.
An.
I can’t stop thinking about Lucy and David man…What a couple
    so damn good, honestly one if my favourite in my whole time of watching anime, just the development of their relationship too, top notch 😅
        I think one of the most commendable parts of the show is just how well Lucy and David’s relationship was based on 10 episodes.
I JUST WISH WE HAD MORE BECAUSE IM AN EMPTY SHELL AFTER THAT ENDING.
It was ok. Honestly felt like the visuals and the love of the "cyberpunk" aesthetic carries the show. The characters and plot are fairly weak. The animation was that great either. Too many scenes of just stills with talking over it.

It's worth a watch for sure. Wasn't a "WOW! AMAZING!" showing from Trigger IMO.
You guys are hyping it up too much this shit better be good
    It's not like it's life changing but it's actually really good. Great action, animation, music, story, characters all wrapped up in 10 episodes. Quite a rollercoaster ride this was. A rollercoaster of a story of how hopeless the lives of people in Night City are. In the words of Johnny Silverhand from the game:

V: "I guess meant... dunno... a happy ending for everyone involved"

Johnny: "Here, for folks like us? Wrong city. Wrong people."
        Night City has a lot of tales to share. Everyone had a dream in that city. Even the shards you read too or brought up by people you meet. The side/romance stories are great too. Edgerunners really hit that spot of “Tales from Night City” vibes.
            "Another turn for the next dreamer."
        I do hope that at some point we get some kind of media involving cyberpunk that has a genuinely happy ending. Just to see how that would look like.
            Some people in the game found a way to co-exist with the city, like Doc Viktor or Misty or River ward, laying low, taking care family, not aiming high...or some people just simply leave night city and become a nomad. Not exactly the happy ending we have in mind, but i guess it's the closest thing to it people could have in that kind of world.
                Yeah, but why not a story where someone aims high and succeeds? That could be cool too.
                    Yeah, its called going corpo, lmao
                    I'm down with that. Nothing's wrong with seeing a choom beating the odds and rise up in NC for once.
            It's kind of hard the setting does have some happy endings but they aren't *cyberpunk* in theme, people stuck in places like night city are kind of stuck..

For example:  There's the Highriders federation which is Africa+Space colonies and it's kind of a utopia, they don't havea horrid problems with poverty/corrupt megacorps, they don't have to deal with the nuclear/climate hellhole much of earth has to, and some of their tech is decades ahead.  They aren't even **Cyberpunk** they use Bioware which are genetically engineer super organs instead of metal cyberware and they don't have cyber-psychosis.  

In a way the future of space colonization and Africa is extremely optimistic and hopeful, just Night City, the Americas'  and most of EU, Asia, and the rest of the world are stuck on earth living in a sort of post apocalyptic society after the nukes/WMD's of the 2020's.
    It is good probably not as life changing as people seem to be hyping it up as I wouldn’t go into it expecting that.
    Its not, from episode 1 there is nothing to care about. Pretty colors or whatever i guess.
        Nowhere near as good as the hype in my opinion.I just can't get into this. Don't really care about the characters or plot.
    Nerd the shit is good , like pretty fucking good . It is a seinen so a lot of violence and some sex here and there just so you're aware. But overall one of the best animes out this year, if not the best one so far.
        Seinen is a demographic,and Cyberpunk's source material was never in any of manga magazines,if anything I whould call it an adult oriented animated show(hell I whouldn't even call it an anime,only it's animation was outsourced to Japan,the creators were polish and american..)
    I think it's as good as a show can be in 10 episodes. But that also means that it can't quite measure up to shows that have more time to breathe. But yeah, seriously can't remember the last time I watched something with a runtime this short that had me that invested.
        I heavily disagree with that sentiment. Ping Pong the animation is my favorite show of all time, and a big reason for that is because it does more with the plot and the character in just 11 episodes than what most shows could do with 24. 

Its all about the density of the information. Many people like to point at the pacing because its an easy thing to notice when it gets fucked up. The key to getting a lot of good content in a short time is to actually slow the pace for a while. There isn't a single second of wasted screen time in Ping Pong, but that doesn't always mean something is happening. There are many scenes where characters just stand around to absorb a moment, giving the audience a chance to so so as well. 

Cyberpunk was all gas no breaks, but it works because its designed to be that way. When things happen, they come at you fast and out of nowhere. Much like in real life, you aren't given the opportunity to prepare for what comes next. It just gets thrown at you and you have to keep moving.
            I agree that the pacing fits and is part of it, but you don't need the same pacing for the entire show. Add a few more somber and slow-paced episodes with character development in between and it would make every character death and decision more impactful and therefor create an overall better show.

Edgerunner lacks those extra episodes but for the runtime that it has it is still amazing. The vast majority of studios would have a really hard time creating a similarly touching story in that little screentime.
An*
If I learned anything about that show is to always listen to your mom. Not listening to mom caused the whole thing.
    ahahaha that seems to generally be the case no 😅
I wish it was a little more neo noir dark/slow. But that wasn’t the theme or pacing they wanted. Just the type of thing I like.

Amazing show though.
    Asking for a slow Trigger show is like asking for a dry swimming pool. I do agree though. If you're interested in a slow-burn cyberpunk themed anime, check out Ergo Proxy if you haven't seen it.
    Studio Trigger doesn't do slow. They are the hype machine after all. 

If you want a Cyberpunk themed and VERY slow story, I would recommend Texhonolyze. That's one of my favorite anime, and in many ways it acts as the exact opposite of this show.
CDPR really redeemed themselves with this one. Given how broken Cyberpunk was at launch, this anime should really spark the interest back in the franchise. If only they would've released the game and the anime at the same time, it would've killed the sales charts. Really enjoyed the show, the music, the action, the story, the character building was very well done. Studio Trigger was the correct choice, and it shows. Now that it is over, I feel bad for binging it all at once. If only this were a much more longer series like say AOT, it would've been something that would surely gain a lot more following.
    Yea for sure man really well put imo, I didn’t understand what people meant when they said the characters were flat and the development wasn’t there when what I was watching seemed to be completely different but really hoping like I said in the OP that they make a new one wether that be next year or two years down the line with new characters and a new arc in night city as there is so much potential :)
This could become a fantastic anthology series working with different studios each season. Imagine if CDPR got Wit, Production IG, or Bones (Mappa too but they need to reduce their own workload first). There’s a ton of potential with the Cyberpunk universe.
I’m quite picky with anime but I just finished it last night and was pleasantly surprised. Really don’t have any gripes outside of a couple editing/pacing decisions. I was expecting something much more generic and basic but I’m definitely going to recommend it to friends.
Since the praise is taken care off by others, and justifiably so, let me ding the show a little.

The car chase/crash scenes are bad. Very bad. The cars all stay in one piece as they tumble in a visibly unrealistic manner.

It wouldn't have caught my attention as much but since the rest of the show is top notch, the car crash scenes stand out as not being of that calibre.
    As far as I understand, its a direct reference to the buggy nature of the cars in game. But yeah, would be hard to look at if somebody didn’t know that beforehand
\*an

I haven’t been this depressed after watching an anime since Welcome to the NHK.
Well, killing adam smasher just got retroactively better in the game after  watching this show.
The ending was kind of a bummer. David promised Lucy  they can go to the moon together but that chance got ruined when David got killed off and Lucy just went to the moon alone and sad. I know it was a prequel to the game but still. I hate heartbreaking endings especially ones with the "*Doesn't get the Boy/Girl*" trope.
Bro I’m about to cry. I literally just finished watching the anime AND WHEN I TELL YALL IM SAD BRO LIKE WHY TF THEY END IT LIKE THIS?!?!?! I’m so mad he couldn’t join Lucy on the moon. Got my eyes watering fr. 10/10 anime 😔😔😔😔
Trigger needs to make more shows
    Quality over quanity
I know what you mean. The music was so awesome I've just been listening to it as my emotions are dead.
    When the anime ends at episode 10 you really feel dead inside. It's like I've already lived a life in night city and its killed me as a person.
        Man as someone who doesn’t vibe at all with tragedies or sad endings this thread really isn’t selling me on the show…
            Well then, I think the whole genre of cyberpunk isn't really your thing. Cyberpunk is essentially that humans are oppressed by corporations, governments and each other, and there is a powerful class while most others live barely above poverty.  As a main character in a cyberpunk setting you will try to rise above the mud but are almost always pushed back and lose in the end.  
  
The whole genre of cyberpunk fiction is like that.
                I dunno, Dimension W and Ergo Proxy were both amazing, dark in atmosphere while being overall fun and interesting. VA-11 HALL-A is also one of my favorite games every, and has a definitively lighthearted tone, if a little melancholic. Hell, even Alita: Battle Angel had distinct elements of optimism.
>	As a main character in a cyberpunk setting you will try to rise above the mud but are almost always pushed back and lose in the end.

This sounds like a defining element of [grimdark](https://youtu.be/PQAWBeFnkg8?t=5m25s) rather than cyberpunk. Not that that’s what Edgerunners is, but it seems like it’s got elements of it here and there from what I’ve heard.
wish is was more then 10 episodes
Heard subs were bad
    Dub is better fitting imo
They went for the akame ga kill ending i see. Smasher no diffed him bro didnt even get a punch in damn.
The show feels like an ode to 80s gore filled yet engaging cyberpunks anime. I want more anime like this not necessarily of same genre but anime with mature and gritty vibe.
I'm going to have to be the outlier here - I watched the first two episodes, and I didn't like it.

It wasn't a problem with production values, or animation - I just found it too mean-spirited for my taste.  The protagonist goes through this trauma conga with no relief or end in sight.  There may have been a time when I was younger when I went in for stories like this, but I'm not that person now (I've been through too much suffering of my own, I guess).

Nothing wrong with somebody else enjoying it, of course.
[deleted]
    glad to hear mate :)
im really glad i played the game beforehand, made the attention to detail in the guns/cars/scenery/factions/slang much better.  Honestly the story in the anime was better than the game IMO, but i think thats just because it has less time to dawdle and had to get to the point in under 4 hours.  Also this is one of the first actually very serious TRIGGER anime that very rarely has comedy, i do hope we get to see more of this style.
I haven’t felt this touched by an anime in a hot minute. So yeah it was pretty good.
Easily the best Cyberpunk anime since Stand Alone Complex.
I'm gonna have to watch it.  Admittedly had bias against it due to it being tied to the game, but I watched trailers today and damn...
    The game has been patched a lot. I went into the game with no expectations and I have been pleasantly surprised at every turn. If you come from a "zero hype" background and look at the game with fresh eyes, it's really a good game.
It’s so fucking epic
loved the setting. loved the animation. characters felt rather flat, apart from the MC, none of them really change, and in the case of the MC his 'evolution' is only explicable due to a drug that has vague and inexplicable manifestations. I enjoyed it, but there was so much more potential. I'd like to see more spin-offs/game adverts. (It did succeed in making me consider re-installing 2077....)
I'd seen some stuff on YouTube, but I didn't want to spoil myself. To be fair, the game left a bad taste in my mouth, so I hesitated to watch it. I guess I'll give it a go this weekend.
    >To be fair, the game left a bad taste in my mouth, so I hesitated to watch it.

The anime retroactively justifies the game's existence, I'd say.
    the game's production was bad. everything else is really good
    Game has been super patched now. Very very good game now. Okay, crafting still sucks but the narrative and story is muack!!!
already better than cowboy bebop
    Better than the live action cowboy Bebop for sure. But the anime? Sorry anime cowboy Bebop is still better.
    naaaah lil bro didnt just say that

&#x200B;

the show is fantastic but Akira and bebop are GOAT's
David could have been different if he made the right choice at the time.

It was frustrating to watch him going into the rabbit hole.
For Real one of the best I've seen . Great pacing , cool visuals and audio, great characters,  bad ass action scenes,  an anime not ridden of stupid cliches,  great plot,  unexpected ending . Damn I just wish those idiots on Netflix would have release the show weekly so that it would have been a better center of attention of our anime community.  Overall I hope more of these kind of stories and anime structures.
Just hook it to my veins
TRIGGER is back on that real shit
Is it CGI? Or actual anime? I might check it out
    It's ridiculous for this day and age how much 2D is in Cyberpunk: Edgerunner. You could tell Trigger had two things not many animation studios in Japan have, TIME and MONEY, both of them at the same time.

There is some 3D in the show, but where they use it the 3D fits really well. But stuff that most modern shows would opt to use 3D for, this show does with 2D art. I was so impressed with the overall production here.
        That sounds great! I'm totally cool with some 3D being used as long as it's integrated well, but I can't stand the fully 3D stuff. Doesn't feel right to me.
            This is one of the most 2D shows you will see this year, not just this season. Only some objects and some vehicles are 3D, and half of those you probably won't even notice are 3D because of how well they are placed in the scene.
        >There is some 3D in the show

This is an understatement, there's a lot of cgi, like all vehicles are cg, and some backgrounds too, [minor spoilers]>!when David fights with the exoskeleton and during the whole car chase in the end the cg is really glaring!<
            That is not even 10%, and the way they animated the vehicles unless they spin it's very hard to notice they are 3D... talk about a blatant lie. And the only backgrounds that were 3D was when a camera was moving through said background, like every time they were showing the Arasaka tower with the camera above the whole thing. Because of the way the camera moves of course you had to do those elements in 3D. But every other background that wasn't Arasaka tower, was almost always 2D, which is a rare feat today.

And if you want to call it CG  write 3DCG, as CG means Computer Generated (CGI is Computer Generated Image) and absolutely every modern anime is ALL CG, since at the end of the day all colorind and putting all the visual elements together (and so much more) is done on a computer, thus making what comes out CG.
        Honestly I didn't like the 3d vehicles in the last episode, but everything else was nova.
            They also had a bunch of guns, especially when they were in your face, in 3D, but you only noticed that by paying very close attention (and you need a trained eye for that). The 3D vehicles at the very end were indeed the most noticeable, but that was probably more to do with the whole construction of the scene and how extensive they were used, because in previous scenes despite using the same tech, the 3D was not easy to spot. I think what go to you was the animation, in previous scenes vehicles were animated differently, as if they were 2D assets, while the animation for the car chase at the end was a lot smoother, and thus made the 3DCG more obvious.

Honestly it could have just as well been a situation where for the amount of vehicles they had in those scenes, there just wasn't enough time to individually key frame animate the cars, like they had done previously.
    it is an actual anime i 100% recommend you do! i was skeptical at first but extremely glad i did in the end. lucky you are getting to watch it for the first time :(
        I'll look into it! 👍
        What platform streams it?
            Netflix and only Netflix
                Thanks!
    CGI is "actual anime".
        CGI anime is a disease
            Have you actually watched any that aren't considered bad?
                What would you recommend?
                    Houseki no Kuni and Beastars are definitely high quality CGI. I'd check one of those out.
                        Don't forget Dorohedoro
                            Framerate is a little choppy for something I would wanna use to convince someone that CGI can look good.
            Gatekeeping is a disease
Just a shame it’s based on a trash game.
    No it's not , the table top is awesome and they fixed the video game up pretty well. Right now it is pretty enjoyable
        Nah the game is still mid. It had bigger problems than bugs.
            mid=trash?
                Obviously you’ve never heard of hyperbole.
    doesnt mean it has bad characters, settings, lore, and story. the production was just a failure.
        Neither of you are right.
            what then?
        Nah take away the bugs, the game was still mid. The story was bland. That doesn’t mean it couldn’t be improved upon but it’s still unexpected taking something mid making it better.
Goddamn spectacular. Probably the best Japan-produced anime I've seen period in the last several years. This is right up there with Arcane.
The biggest compliment I can give this anime is that it actually makes me want to reinstall the game and try to finish it this time. Now that's impressive.
    I suddenly want to make a sandevistan build.
I just started it today I’m already finished definitely a great watch
It was good but I prefer kill la kill (their first anime Aka masterpiece)
I think the show was visually breathtaking, but the story was very convoluted and wonky. I'm not sure it's as grand as everyone is making it out to be as a whole. Some definite eye candy though.
Agree
Not enough episodes, they should do more standalones based off of other afterlife legends.
Freaking revolutionary anime, this is one of the best representations of what modern anime can do
It’s making me want to play the game
It actually reminds me of that one cyberpunk themed anime where the top criminals are forced and tasked to free this two kids and send them to the other end / out of the city. I don't remember the name.

Spoiler alert :


The way that anime end is quite similar to how edgerunner ended so i had this very suspecting feel that the inspiration behind the plot of edgerunner is based on this anime since that anime is out wayy before cyberpunk were released.
Genuinely my fav anime this whole year maybe it’s jus recency bias but I can’t think of anything I’d put over it
Maybe all of the budget went into the show than the game.
Game adaptations are going hard lately
Amazing 10/10.

Now I want to play for sure the videogame.
it’s so good, im on episode 8 right now and I’ve been shook
When "I REALLY WANT TO STAY AT YOUR HOUSE" starts playing during the game I'm driving not fast traveling to the objective.
it was alright

the ending would've hit harder if david barely beat adam smasher, and he and lucy ran away to hijack a ship to the moon - and he dies after reaching it
LOVED IT! Absolutely classic crime noir/cyberpunk all the way, it doesn't do anything new in these genres but goddamn it gets it perfect down to the ending!(I honestly hope that was it, an attempt to continue this would spoil it)

Highly advised if you have a hankering for sinking into a corrupt morass of sociopaths back stabbing each other for coin, with no possible escape from the nihilism.
    If they do attempt to make more, I hope it's an anthology type thing. I've seen some people suggest a series based on Trauma Team, and I feel like that could work
        Yea I'd be on board with that! Or possibly show the evolution and backstory of one of the random mooks our protagonists encountered and tangled with. The urinating Cyber-psychosis dude for instance, be weird to follow his origin story lol
            ahahaha that would be funny af. he had mil cyberware so who knows where he got it from
I wasn’t a fan of the art style or animation at all. But the phenomenal story made up for it.
Trigger just doing their thing 👌
Most badass anime I've ever seen (Keep in mind I dont really watch anime but when I do it's going to be action and gore thats why my brothers and I loved the old DBZ movies and episodes including the Naruto movies)
I really enjoyed it. It definitely set the scene and added to the robust lore of the game. After playing the game and then watching the show I felt they definitely fit in one of the same while also being unique. 

Edgerunners was a bitter sweet symphony and I enjoyed every second of it. From every gonk moment to the thought provoking imagery or story elements. The soundtrack was amazing the characters got me hooked and sunk in pretty quick. The voice actors did an amazing job. Just made each one more unique and made me invest more. 

I personally wish they did this sooner or even do this on a regular basis. Cyberpunk side stories to add to the world they are building through new patches to the game.
Now this is how the Video game should have been. Way better plot (granted the game’s script was solid as well but the mechanics and glitches made it shit)

Aside from maybe 88 Part 2 (because last two episodes was split into this year) this is definitely seen as anime of the year for me.
you just took words out of my mouth 😭😭
Same, feel broken..
“All legends die” is what I was thinking as the last two episodes played. I feel broken and shown a glimpse of reality, or induced with some feeling, that will take time to melt back and get casually overtaken by normal everyday life. I loved the journey, the people, and their dreams, that’s why I hate the ending.
Dope show
I ugly cried at the end. Then I got up and walked aimlessly across my house...and broke into tears again like someone just killed my damn dog.
I absolutely loved this series and binged it entirely this weekend. God it was amazing!
Please give me recommendations
Just finished the show, what an amazingly wild ride. This is undoubtedly Trigger's best show since Kill La Kill, as I felt their past shows have rather been lukewarm at best, like Brand New Animal which I found rather lackluster with its meh story and world building. This on the other hand, they fucking nailed it with good pacing, great action, good character development and a bitter-sweet ending in just only 10 episodes, which is an amazing feat in itself that not a lot of show could pull off. Usually I would complain about a Netflix show being short and need more episodes, but in this case Edgerunner's one strong 10 episodes package that wrapped up nicely.
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAXE8nVNnBQ&ab\_channel=Mxzmrr](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAXE8nVNnBQ&ab_channel=Mxzmrr) FAN THEORY THAT DAVID IS STILL ALIVE
Everyone in the comments: “I just finished the show, and I feel empty”

Me: **P A I N**
Eh... binged the show in one sitting and don't get me wrong, it was entertaining. But people are making it seem like this was the holy grail of animes. I thought it was just "ok." Last episode felt predictable and honestly, I'm disappointed I didn't get thrown to feelsville like the rest of y'all. 

I don't know, maybe I have poor taste.
It's truely sticking around for the long run. I keep watching the last 5 or so minutes of the end and almost restarting the pain.
    [deleted]
        I can't help myself, it's just so good! It's almost like I'm hoping it will change or something, but I know it wont.
    [deleted]
        Same, I want to know what's going on with Lucy and Falco. It would be so cool if they somehow ended up back in the game or another story somewhere down the line. 

Hell, I'm more interested in this story than the regular game to be honest. Johnny was cool, but never felt like I cared for him, I want a crew like the show or beginning of the game.
Hallmark of a good show. Just finished it and I have that emptiness as well.
[deleted]
I just finished 30 minutes ago and I am hurting rn
everytime i stick it on bluetooth in the car i just get sad vibes all the time man :(
    For me it was already a bittersweet song anyway. I (male v) grew super attached to Judy in my first playthrough and when that song would be on the radio it made me think of her. Then the let down happens later in her story and the song always gave me accepting-but-crushed feelings since. 😂
    What’s the name of the song?
        i really wanna stay at your house ahahaha
    I feel you
It's like David's entire character was based on how that song feels. It hit hard in the last ep.
:(
I can't stop listening to it ! 😞
I've been seeing this stated, but don't quite grasp why the song has added weight now? Just finished the show, listened to the song and read the lyrics, but just don't understand.
    I’ve connected the song to the moon scene. For me signifies how all good things come to an end but you should still pursue your goals. Bittersweet for sure
    Did you not notice the songs use in key scenes in Edgerunners? People are now linking those scenes with the song in their mind. Big Sad.
Same director too.
    no wonder it's so good
I’ve seen like 4-5 posts a day since it released praising the show. I haven’t seen this positive of a reception for a Netflix produced anime on this subreddit in a while.
    Trigger studio produced*
    I’m like 4 episodes in, and there’s good reason for it, might be the first time ever that the show is better than the source material in terms of video game anime adaptations
        How the turntables huh
            yep. usually with game-adapted anime we will get the usual low quality shows which always fail the source materials but this anime is a much better experience than what the game could offer.
        Very rare that those things happen. The only other one I can recall is that the author of Fight Club the book thought that Fight Club the movie had a much stronger ending.
there was just one post because netflix release all at once
    Yeah , that kinda kills the hype . The show " Vampire in the Garden " it's short but really good as well but since Netflix releases the whole thing in one go it never really gives the shows time to become more popular through general discussion of it in the communities.
        Stranger Things is popular and that had all the episodes released at once. More like anime community isn't the best place to discuss when we are going through a blitz of post. Also need to give people time to watch it. Not everyone likes to binge watch
            Stranger things initially premiered at a time when streaming services were just becoming dominant and "Netflix Original" still was a brand that was batting 1000. The idea of dropping a season all at once was still this novel thing and it happened in a much much less saturated market. Today, there are way more shows dropping seasons all at once (And then flipping a coin to see if they're cancelled). Unless you have already got an entrenched audience from the Before Times like Stranger things, it's harder to demand attention this way anymore.
        I think the anime community is a bit too hype oriented. How do other fandoms operate around it? Video games don't have seasons, they all come out at once. So does a lot of other stuff. But discussions still happen weeks or even months after a game's release.

I think the real problem is the anime community as a whole and this sub have gotten a bit too dependent on the seasonal cycle of weekly discussion, and can't operate outside of hype and bandwagoning. By the time people have binged all the episodes of Edgerunner, the community would have already moved on to the next shiny season. It's kinda self limiting and people often forget about the stuff they were hyping just last season.
            Well, that's what happens when there's so *much* anime and so much of it is at least good (but so little is genuinely great).
            I think the biggest reason is that the majority of the anime community just moves on. There's always a new show to talk about instead.
            > Video games don't have seasons, they all come out at once. So does a lot of other stuff. But discussions still happen weeks or even months after a game's release.

Because there's more than a few hours of content in games usually.  If there isn't, then there is at least tactics and strategies, they have replay value, or the discussion just dies.

Also, games rarely come out all at once at this point.  They are either missing features that are added later or there is DLC that probably could've just been part of the original game.
                If anime is shorter than a video game, shouldn't that make it easier for people to discuss an anime that released all at once compared to a 50+ hour game? I don't really see the difference you're trying to point out. Months have passed and people are still finding new things in Elden Ring. Similarly, in manga communities like One Piece, Attack on Titan or Made in Abyss, people are discovering new things and discussing with the community everyday.

We don't have that in the anime community, everyone's attention span only works for 12 weeks at a time. Weekly discussions are so limiting, and if I try discussing something like Vinland Saga, people are gonna be like "are we still in 2019?"
                    > Similarly, in manga communities like One Piece, Attack on Titan or Made in Abyss, people are discovering new things and discussing with the community everyday.

That's a bad example for your case. A lot of manga discussion runs around the fact that there's an ongoing cycle (weekly, monthly,...), there's a lot more One Piece discussion when there's a One Piece chapter. On the other hand, a finished manga like Monster will get mentioned about as much as its anime, once in a blue moon. 

Even AoT which still gets more discussion is mostly fuelled by the controversial ending, memes, and the upcoming final final final season.
                        Fair point. But you're kind of dismissing the AoT discussion. Do you think r/anime is gonna talk about the controversial ending months after AoT wraps up, like the manga community did? Or do you think it'll be a 1 week controversy before everyone moves onto discussing the next season?
                            Hmm I don't think we'll see threads discussing it every week, but it's something that will sink into public awareness for sure and get brought up commonly.

I'd compare it to Wonder Egg Priority. It wasn't the most popular show, but its ending still left a strong lasting effect, that it gets brought up every once in a while. I imagine AoT will have something similar, on a much larger scale, I mean already it keeps getting brought up on r/anime by manga readers.
            Isn't it the lack of marketing for anime in the west?
            Having a pinned weekly discussion thread would go a long way. People talk about batch releases killing discussion, but I think far more of the problem is their discussion forums of choice. Or more accurately that they're not forums
            Meanwhile there's me who waits for entire cours to finish and then binges them in 3 days because I'm fuckin done with cliffhangers. I appreciate Netflix cutting out the middleman.
            I mean, it's a lot easier to discuss one thing at a time rather then 12, and there needs some time to digest and analyze everything you see.
                I see your point. But the same applies to video games. And even now, years later, I still see discussions and YouTube videos about games that came out long ago. Elden Ring came out months ago and people are still discovering and analyzing new things.

Meanwhile the anime community has a 12 week window of analysis, and after that they're already moving onto another show. For example, a show like Attack on Titan, there's just so much going on that you can't analyze that in one season. The manga community is always finding stuff that happened many chapters ago and connecting it with newer information.

Meanwhile the anime community just stops talking about it once the season ends, very few in the community dig deeper into shows long after they've finished airing. A show like Odd Taxi for example, gets better on rewatch after you know what happens in the last episode, but by that point people aren't around to discuss it anymore because the new season along with new hype trains have started.
            > Video games don't have seasons, they all come out at once. So does a lot of other stuff. But discussions still happen weeks or even months after a game's release.

Videogames are more hype based than any medium  and they discussion tends to die fairly quickly (ofc based on its length) for single player games that do not have DLC. Let's remember that the average for beating a videogame does not reach 30%.

And they do have seasons. Some are DLC for single player experiences, like cyberpunk recent boom caused by the dlc + sale of the base game, others are actually called season (gamepass included) for the game as a service trend for multiplayer games.
            >Video games don't have seasons

I mean actually a lot of the most popular video games **do** have seasons now.
            > Video games don't have seasons, they all come out at once.

*Destiny sweating profusely*
        My theory is that the weekly release schedule vs batch release is actually the smaller issue, and the big problem with batch releases is that their release often doesn't align with the start of a new season.

Conventional wisdom would dictate that you should release your show when nothing else comes out. Anime is still strongly bound to seasons though, so fans will, unsurprisingly, look for new shows when there's actually new shows to watch.

Additionally, these shows also don't get featured in Anituber seasonal recommendations, since they're not out by the time the video is made, and too old when the new season rolls around.

ReLIFE for example was a batch release that aligned with the Summer 2016 season and didn't get overlooked.
        Vampire in the garden was okay imo
        Does the opposite for a lot of people, I for one hate watching weekly and can get a lot more hyped when I can watch something as fast or as slow as I want. Weeklies just annihilates any sense of pacing to me.
        Honestly I think Edgerunners was better served by being released in a bingeable format. I think releasing weekly would have been a huge mistake with some of the big shows on the horizon. A lot of attention is going to be on stuff like Chainsaw Man and Spy X Family S2 soon.

Plus Edgerunners was really designed to be released in that format from the start and you can tell. If you were to watch it by just one episode a week it would start really, really slow and not be a good indicator of what the rest of the show is.
            Interesting opinion to be honest ,I believe that "longer exposure = more viewership " but I honestly never considered competition from heavy hitters ( this fall season is going to be bonkers)
                Mind you I think Cyberpunk is a unique scenario with it, because its a kind of sleeper hit. I dont think pre release anyone expected it to be as good as it is.

As a fan of not only the tabletop source material, cyberpunk 2020, and the game Cyberpunk 2077, and having watched several Trigger projects. I didnt even think it'd be this good.

So if it was drawn out over a weekly schedule over the course of 10 weeks and then had to go up against Spy x Family, Chainsaw Man, etc. I just dont think it would have grabbed the traction it currently has.
    [nah, they released 10 discussion posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/xd0lld/cyberpunk_edgerunners_episode_10_discussion/) but there is a good chance they just got lost in the shuffle.
    nah bruh saw alot of post about this show on MAL stop the cap and shut up with this weekly shit it old
One of the top series of the season for me. Also the shortest amount of episodes I've ever needed to get so attached to the characters.

Absolute banger anime.
    Episode one, ok I’m bingeing this. It was 2am so kindda passed out and only have 2 episodes left, already dreading the end cuz I’m going to want more. 

The world, the characters, the animation, the music, this anime is one of the best I’ve seen in a very long time.
netflix exclusive that was released all at once
It's a video game adjacent adaptation. I hear all the time that the Dragon Quest anime is incredible, but I've never seen a single person talk about it here despite its popularity in Japan.
    that has less to do with the fact the origin is video game, and more to do with dragon quest not being that popular outside of Japan
        Well everyone outside of Japan should stop being snobs and play Dragon Quest then.
            I feel like every gamer should play at least one Dragon Quest game in thier lives, there's just something about it that hits different despite being so traditional.

Thankfully Dragon Quest 11 is on basically every platform now, with only the PS4 not having the definitive edition. 

Considering the games have changes platforms constantly, right now is arguably the easiest it has ever been to get into the series-esspecially since DQ11 is one of the best.
            [deleted]
                I respectfully disagree. Toriyama style also works well for Dragon Quest.
            For those that like jrpgs, sure. But that genre is niche so you can not expect all kind of players to try it.
    Dragon Quest Adventure of Dai has been a favorite of mine as of late, truly the best reboot anime aside from Fruits Basket.

It's almost over, and I'm sort of sad to see it go.

Also Popp, Hyunkel, Hadlar, and of course, Dai have all become some of my favorite characters.

Popp in particular is an example of some of the best character growth I have ever seen on an anime.

It is a *crime* that more people aren't watching it, or haven't been watching it for so long when it is about to end at episode 100.
I’m not too big on the story like everyone else seems to be I still liked it tho. For me it kinda drops after episode 6 picks up a bit and then the ending kinda just ends.
    I'm in complete agreement with you. It's so visually appealing to watch but the story is fairly messy and doesn't make a ton of sense at points. Like it was trying to be deeper in its plot than it actually really was or even needed to be which just made it super confusing to follow at times. Especially at the end where it sometimes went from Point A to Point C without exploring Point B (without getting too spoiler heavy, Feredey and Kiwi's talk about Lucy in the beginning of Episode 9 really irked me and made no sense whatsoever; makes it hard to know or follow the story they were presenting when they pull stuff out of their ass like that). Should've just kept it simple instead of going for some grand script they couldn't quite deliver on.
        What was the grand script? It was a fairly simple story.
> I'm seriously surprised theres so little discussion about the show on this sub. 

So little? I've seen at least one post a day reach front page of the sub with hundreds of comments since the release date.
There is.....
There were 11 megathreads the day it released.
The subtitle Edge Runners was a mistake I think, it makes it sound like a Blade Runner parody!
me too man me too and once again i think you are spot on with the way you have put it. really looking forward to the next one which should happen from the reception it has gotten 😄
yep, i skipped school today for this show
I know... So short nice and short
To be fair, the cyberpunk universe/lore provides a lot to work with.

With how seriously CD project red takes their games' lore, I would've been surprised if the anime ended up subpar. My expectations weren't insanely high, but I wasn't expecting it to be bad either.
    I think Cyber Punk was already an established law before CDPR brought out the half arsed game same with witchery
        No, the game has all new lore, and the anime uses that. The story itself was written by CDPR.

2020 called though, they want their hater bandwagon back.
            They scammed me as well as a lot of others I've got a right to be a hater I think
                > They scammed me

How did they scam you? I mean, you definitely waited until it released and reviews came out before buying, right? Certainly you didn't pre-pay for a product that doesn't exist solely on the faith that a company wouldn't fuck up, right?

They released a bad product, but they didn't scam you.
                You're one of those that dreamed up a perfect GTA clone and got mad when you didn't get it? Okay.
                    Yeah that's right completely dismiss the valid reason I have to dislike the company. It was a shit show I'm glad they've not given up on it completely but when you scam your customers you reap what you sow
                        You're free to dislike the game and the company. But most people calling them scammers are complaining about promises that were never made or features that were explicitly cut before release.
                            [deleted]
                                The game ran like shit on previous gen and deserves all the criticism, but the game itself was great on PC and next gen.

You're free to dislike the game, I don't really care about anyone's opinion tbh, what irks me is the fact that people like you keep bringing up promises that were never made, like GTA sandbox features, when the game is very obviously a story driven RPG.

You said It here, the features you "expected". Just because the game takes place in a city, doesn't mean It's meant to be a sandbox like GTA. People dreamed up a game and got mad when their fantasy didn't become reality.
                    I love Cyberpunk but this isn’t a fair assessment, they quite clearly marketed it as a perfect GTA clone; I’m not gonna say that all the backlash that CDPR got was warranted but a good chunk of it definitely was
                        No, it wasn't, at all. If you watched clickbait videos dreaming up the ultimate game, maybe. But this was always an RPG first, like the Witcher. This is what I'm talking about.

Edit: A guy commented and instantly blocked me about this. Holy shit, you people have some issues.
                            The RPG side of CP2077 is the worst aspect of it lmfao. 

You're dickriding way too much, I'm sorry your game failed and they had to spend 2 years making it decent. I'm sorry you're only getting 1 dlc before they jump ship to Witcher 4. I'm sorry you have to sit out here running defense for a company that will never care about you.
    To be faaaiiirrrr🎶
It had every right to be as good as it was, TRIGGER has been making bangers since they formed as a company after Gainax shit the bed.
Instead of a remake if they make a live action show with an original story in same universe it can be interesting like first season of Altered Carbon which was great.
A live action cyberpunk would be amazing. It'd also be really fuckin' expensive.

I'd be ok with 3DCG Cyberpunk show... get some UE5 in there, some real time rendering, with advanced mocap tech, some livecapture facial action, and they could produce something visually stunning, relatively quickly once the pipeline is setup that would definetly scratch the itch... and it'd even actually positively contribute towards CDProjekt's move into UE5 as they develop the sequel in that engine.

It doesn't have to be Arcane quality, or even Edgerunners quality - but it could still work really well with the level of animation quality found in the original Cyberpunk.
I mean... When all this talk started of a CP show, I was hoping for a "live action". Was initially disappointed finding out it was going to be an anime. I like anime, just didn't think that would be the medium at first. 

I do agree though about making an adaptation of the anime being a bad idea.
What a gonk.

/S
YES EXACTLY, the female characters in this story are very one dimensional, Lucy is a very flat character that is just akward virgin male bait and kiwi's motivations don't exist she just did what she did for money I guess???

And if they're going to have a beauty like Lucy fall for David so quickly, why give him the personality of a potato? At least write him with more charisma so it's believable. 

Otherwise it's the best anime since arcane(which is an anime fight me)
    You nailed it.

Like, I get it.  I *honestly* do; as a woman, I'm socialized to empathize with men in media.  The character archetype Lucy belongs to is a salve designed to address male insecurities about not feeling special, unique, or important.

While I'm sure it's incredibly helpful to young men to see characters like that in media, and work through (and/or languish in) that insecurity in the shared mediaspace, to me it's kinda boring.  And repetitive.  And honestly more depressing the more you think about it.  

Because the takeaway message for me and other women is kind of the opposite.  That I *am* special, but my special calling is to have some boy glom onto me like an imprinted duckling, at which point, I become solely responsible for his social development. 

I just wish filmmakers cared about my insecurities this much.  

I still liked Edgerunners a lot.  Imaishi is REALLY good at his job.  But I would have liked to like it just a little bit more.
>  the girl having the body of a prepubescent child

RIP Becca
    I'm... actually not going to go bluehairedfeminist on Becca.  

Maybe I could, maybe I should, maybe you expect me to, maybe **not** having anything to say about Becca reflects poorly of me to all the other cool feminists, but nah.  Got nothing. 

Thought she was a short young adult.  

Maybe if it was Melissa Fahn or Christina "Vee" Valenzuela's voice and not Alex Cazares, I might have had a different reaction.  But Alex's performance really sells a sense of lived frustration with her body and how her presentation prehudices others that's festered for 20+ years.

Some adults are just short.  I'm not mad about this one. 

I'm more annoyed that she "competes" for the affection of the audience surrogate character.  I'm kind of over that trope, feel like I've gotten more than a lifetime's fill.

    X2 don't
Nah, he's dead. Even if Arsaka do make him a construct, he should be a part of Alt by the end of the game since Alt destroys Mikoshi and absorbs all the constructs / engrams. At the very best, you can say that David migt be alive, but is now a part of a rogue AI in cyberspace.
>Leaves you wanting more from something with nothing left 

Holy shit, this describes it perfectly!
Is kill la kill like cowboy bebop? Like this one.. Short.. I mean
> The ending fucking broke me though.

The back half of the series was like coming down.

Everything's "good" and "fun" and then it all starts going to shit. You want to go back, and recapture the magic but all you can do is grit your teeth and plow forward to the end.

What a wild ride.
    Yes…yes.
I was part of the day 1 wave and decided to wait till they fixed it. Now I wanna go back to playing it again
    Yoooo same here, was caught up in some bugs in the first 24-48 hours and then told myself i'll come back in a week/month when they fix things up. 

Not sure why I haven't got back too either....
        Feel like shit that I preordered a PS4 disk version...
The game has quite the unfortunate abbreviation.
    Can't unsee it now.
masterclass indeed mate, need to check out the other ones now ahahaha
I don't mean to undermine Trigger's work but they only worked on animation and character design and got approved from CdPR. Ost, story was all from CDPR writers. Witcher 3 writer did the story for this.
    The story is by CDPR but the rest of the show (including the script) is full Trigger and if you've seen Imaishi's other work, it's very similar.
    If they worked on it, theyre part of the team. So the credit definitely goes to Trigger.  


Besides, the production team has the final call on how to translate script to animation.
    > they only worked on animation and character design and got approved from CdPR. Ost, story was all from CDPR writers.

I mean you do remind people of CDPR's involvement on the project which I appreciate, but the split of work you present here is much harsher than it is in reality.

The original story is definitely from CDPR's side, but as other people have mentioned, Trigger was involved already on the script. Simply going by the opening credits we have:

From CDPR: Mike Pondsmith credited on creation of the Cyberpunk 2077 universe, another creation credit on Rafal Jaki, while the screen story is credited on Bartosz Sztybor.

From Trigger: Both creators credited on script, Masahiko Otsuka and Yoshiki Usa, are Trigger adjacent, and Hiromi Wakabayashi who is credited for "creative support" has always been involved on the narrative side of Trigger productions.

Of course, credits can often give a fairly vague idea of what the tasks ultimately were, but [this video](https://streamable.com/goylj2) linked on this thread demonstrates that Trigger already influenced the story in such central aspects as the composition of the main cast of the story. Also, to my understanding the anime uses songs from the franchise, but the ost itself is by Akira Yamaoka (no prior association to either company) and sound director, the person who along with director decides on the usage of soundtrack, is Hiroki Urakari, who has worked previously in Trigger projects.

Of course, another paragraph could be made on CDPR creators' involvement on the visual side - and *even a longer, slightly hypocritical one* could be made on how crediting different aspects of creative works on companies rather than individuals isn't ideal in general.

Anyway, the fundamental tl;dr point was that things aren't that black and white.
    Writer for the game right? Because I don't see the author getting into something like this.
        Yes witcher 3 the wild hunt. The author only did the books
    It was visually stunning as expected tho. They know what they can do and they do it well
    I might watch this then, with the comfort of knowing aliens won't show up 2 episodes before the end.

Saving anime but yet again
Truly one of their anime of all time.
    I lost it when David said "So you guys... are Cyberpunks"
        I got goosebumps when he said "it's edgerunnin' time!"
            Best line was when he said he was built different
                Im glad im not the only one that that line stood out to
                The best part is I'm pretty sure several of these lines actually did get said and non of it made me roll my eyes.
                my friends all lost it at that line, had to pause our viewing party to laugh for a good minute
            That line was never actually said unlike the other two lines.  
The real line was "it's edgin' time"
Trigger saving anime one show at a time https://streamable.com/goylj2
    What, they wanted to cut Rebecca?  So glad Trigger held their ground on this.
    Hey what is this from? I'm curious to watch more.
        They did a stream the day before release streaming the first 3 episodes and some discussion. Unfortunately the vod is gone now so you'll have to search if someone reuploaded it somewhere, I had a quick look and didn't find it but it's probably out there somewhere.
    [deleted]
        Reminds me how in the VN VA-11 Hall-A which also has a cyberpunk setting there's a character who's a sex worker android and she chose to stay with her younger body not getting an upgrade to appeal to that certain "market". It's weird but thinking about it of course there's be shit like this...
I mean... Star wars visions was literally their last show before cyberpunk...
    I think that might be the joke.
        Then Woosh on me
            I don't want to whoosh on you. Only when the time.... Is right.
They wanted their own Arcane so they made Edgerunners
    I mean, both are great
    Odd take.
The dub is pretty high quality in my opinion, and I usually can't stand watching dubs. There is also certain slang from the game ("choom", "preem" etc.) that are subtitled, but they don't actually have that kind of lingo in Japanese, so if you listen for that kind of thing then you'll notice it. In my opinion, even if the Japanese version is the "original" version, it kinda feels like it was made for English. But the Japanese acting is great too if you just prefer it.

The real problem is that the subtitles are apparently not good; I did not check them but they are apparently full of straight-up errors, as if it were transcribed by a machine (which gets especially bad when it comes to the slang).
    Oh yeah the street lingo is def something that works better with EN since it was originally written in EN.
    I'm definitely not someone that's familiar with Japanese, but even I can say the subs are total shit in some scenes. 

Half the calls they make don't even translate properly, I don't know which call but I'm pretty sure the whole convo goes very differently from what the on-screen text (call hologram) shows. 

That said, you're pretty much going to understand it all if you're a regular anime sub watcher.
    I haven't checked but apparently the English captions for the English dub have been fixed. Also, there are seperate english subtitles that are meant for the Japanese dub, which don't have those errors.
        The separate subtitles for the Japanese dub still suck.
    Also, the dub has Giancarlo Esposito. Nuff said.
    Need to hear Giancarlo's sexy voice too!
    It's also all the different accents too. NC is incredibly diverse and that shines through much better in the dub imo.
Dub cast is stacked, I'd watch dubbed first and sub after.
the setting and culture dictates eng dub is the best way to watch it.
English for sure, subs would distract from the amazing visuals and I've heard the subs have some translation issues with some of the uniquely named stuff. Plus it takes place in America so everyone speaks English anyway, there's also a lot of different accents as night city is very varied, not sure how those are in the sub.
    Rewatched in Dub recently. I haven't said this in a LONG time, but the Dub is just objectively far better than the sub for the reasons that you've already mentioned. 

And as you already said, this anime is extremely well made and it's a crime how much the subs distract you. Generally it's the ground or whatever uninteresting stuff that's there at the bottom of the screen, but edgerunners made the fucking street garbage look world class.

Like what the fuck Studio Trigger? xD

Amazing experience, still in the high from when it released.
    There are two characters that don't speak English. Which is even funnier in the Japanese dub because the subtitles just say "in japanese" despite everyone speaking japanese.
I watched the dub version and 1 ep of sub (jp). For me the dub was better. But overall anyway you watch it it will be good. 


I disliked last ep though. But thats my personal exp.
I watched ep 1 in both. Voice acting is great for both versions, but the sketchy subs, plus it just felt "right" to watch it in english, as an english speaker. And I usually always watch subs.
If someone tells you they preferred the sub for this it's a plain giveaway they're trying very hard to look like they have the "correct" opinion about dubs vs subs, honestly this feels like it was written in English and there's a Japanese dub.
    Damn people can't have preferences anymore.
        Lol you miss the point
    I was shocked to see that the Japanese was the original cause until I saw that, I was under the impression of the opposite lol
    The jaoanese voice acting was fine but the subs were absolute garbage and at times made no sense at all.
        The actors themselves are great, but so were the English VAs, and English felt more natural in night city.
    Lmao, or you're a fast reader and it doesn't detract in any way to listen to the originally cast va's
        I can literally speak fluent Japanese. English is the way to go here. The English cast is objectively better, and hearing them use similarish words in Japanese to what the real script obviously is (aka cyberpunk lingo) is just bad
            That's nice, but I've heard both, and the Japanese VA is strictly better imo. David especially, his English VA is flat as fuck. Rebecca is also 1000 times better jp
English. VA is top notch
English dub due to the extensive slang lingo used in the anime.
It's probably the strongest dub I've seen in years. I think it helps that it was written in english first so it feels way more natural than a lot of dubbed anime since it doesn't have to try and translate the lines from another lanuage and then rewrite that so it works within the lipflaps of the animation.

But even aside from that the subtitle track is just fucking awful, it feels like we're reading the results of something that was translated from english to japanese, then back to english by a different guy. There's also lots of errors too.
Becca for me, best girl unrequited love.
    Dude she did not deserve to go out like that. Like out of everyone I think she got the rawest deal. At least the main two got a period of raw bliss. Sure they were worried about each other, but they had it. Same with Maine and Dopio. Becca got sold out by her friend (which ultimately lead to all their deaths), while dealing with the grief of her brother’s death and unrequited love for a guy that she has to watch die in order to save someone else.
There's only one real narrative rule in the Cyberpunk handbook and it's been consistent this whole time, there are no happy endings in Night City.
The biggest villian in this anime is the Night City itself. And its masterfully done
    The biggest villain in this anime is late stage capitalism
    Maybe if you add the context from the game, but I don't think that it was that well conveyed in the anime (specially give that it was a short story), maybe if becomes an anthology series they could flesh out that more, but as an anime only I don't see it.
        I thought it was well conveyed and I've never played the game. I got it the moment [Edgerunners spoilers]>!David's mom was processed and forgotten about like a used soda tin can!<
Adam Smasher dying to a few quickhacks in cyberpunk 2077 made him look really silly in the show for me lol
    I still can't believe his level caps at 30 unless you're doing the "Don't fear the Reaper" route
    Despite seeing a bunch of similar comments to this he feels absolutely menacing to someone who just started the game after watching the show.
        theyve buffed him up quite abit in the newest update
    V is a pretty much a monster at the end of the game, it's kinda funny with the silent takedown V just unplug Adam smasher to death tho.
The predictability is very much intentional. I knew it was going to happen and it crushed me to watch David gradually lose it after the time skip. Really reinforced the connection to his character.
Yeah that's what I thought. Story wasn't bad by any means, but it was predictable and the pacing was messy at times. 

That being said the animation, soundtrack, and general atmosphere of the show were fantastic. Had a lot of fun with it and it's one of my favorite of the year.
Honestly the only unpredictable thing is how it ends but it’s more like a “oh that’s it” for me.
Lmfao my biggest pet peeve with that shit show was that the Mc wore a fucking sweater the whole time . Everyone else had like armor or assassin shit but that lamo had a Ned Flanders ass sweater.
    [deleted]
        What's the point of armor in a show where characters can cleave through iron like it's paper.
With Dont fear the reaper route dude literally solo the arasaka hq and just unplug Adam smasher cables
    Don't fear the reaper route is best ending for real, the second V grabbed Johnny's hand and the silverhand theme kicks in. doom music vibes
We don't actually know if V did though. I mean, for all we know, dying in don't fear the reaper route could be cannon
Its annoying that on these bring hype to a new anime post someone has to write spoiler in them
Right? Someone buy that girl a David Martinez on the rocks and a bag of Moonchies!
It's fast-paced, but it's not *quite* the usual Trigger insanity. It actually felt a lot more like an old-school GAINAX show than a Trigger one to me, honestly.

e: Like, if you've seen the Buster OVAs (Gunbuster and Diebuster) and you thought those had alright pacing and weren't too hyperactive, you'll be good with Edgerunners.
    That’s good too hear! I haven’t watched those but I probably should as I always hear good things about them
    I've never encountered another person who's seen Diebuster in the wild.
        It's incredibly underseen and more people need to watch it.
            What's about
It's not... not those things. If you're at all familiar with Imaishi his trademarks are all there.

It's significantly more intense in tone, though, so it's a very different experience than anything they've made before.
CDPR did the story so Trigger's pacing of the show doesn't get applied here. They only animated it
    Scene pacing is definitely very imaishi. At the end of the day the director has a huge input on pacing and storytelling no matter the script.
        Trigger also has script writing credit, so it's difficult to say who did what and how much
Not quite on the level of their other works, I'd say about 50% sugar level for what they usually do — which is still a lot. But it comes off more as a hyper-stylized anime more so than a Trigger-happy anime, which is saying something.
Then go and watch Arcane aswell. Masterclass above CP77
    I have, I enjoyed the soundtrack and writing but couldn't really get behind the art style as much as CP77, Trigger did a phenomenal job.
    i prefer edgerunners over arcane, though theyre both great. edgerunners soundtrack shits all over arcanes sountrack tho, having to listen to imagine dragons in pivotal scenes made me irrationally mad
        Yeah indeed.
Play the game . Also , Dorohedoro , Komi, Baki, Castlevanias, Devilman Crybaby , Blue Period , High Score Girl. Hell even arcane that technically is an anime.... Netflix makes some good ass shows .
    Dorohedoro criminally underrated.

&#x200B;

also Baki Enjoyer = Based + chadpilled
        What is dorohoro about
            It's... hard to explain but basically it's about this guy named Kaiman, an amnesic man disfigured by Magic who tries to recover both his original face and memories about his past.

And the adventures he encounters trying to reach that point.

This link explains the plot better:

https://dorohedoro.fandom.com/wiki/Dorohedoro
    Arcane, Castlevania are not anime, japanese studios didn't produce them. They don't have entries on anime db's like mal etc.
        According you
            According to me, anime community and definition of what "Anime" is. Go check any Anime DB and see what entries they have registered, you won't find these but cyberpunk is there coz Trigger a jp studio produced it.
                >According to me

Worthless 

>anime community and definition of what "Anime" is.

There is no consensus, stupid .

>Go check any Anime DB and see what entries they have registered,

I won't,  that shit ain't an anime authority. 

Don't reply kid , I could only care for your opinion if I were getting paid to hear it .
                    You're just a dumbass baboon with 2 braincells
            Hell even just check this place r/anime, there are no discussion threads or anything, that should tell your dumb brain something.
    >Castlevanias, Devilman Crybaby

Ooooohhh, you've got a point there. These are two of my recent favorites too. That said, Edgerunners even blows them out of the water IMO. Maybe its just a perfect storm scenario as it appeals to so many of my anime and anime adjacent interests. 

\-Ah yeah, definitely. I just bought it. It's actually going for 50% off on the PS Store atm
I’m not finished yet, but I’m really enjoying that show
    Nice. I like Arcane and that love death robot too. So I guess this can be a good sign.
        Okay now I finished the show and I just dont know what to say. In my opinion the show is really well made and definitly worth a watch. The Animation, the soundtrack and the characters are just perfect. And I really agree with OP, now I’m feeling empty
            welcome to the club homie ;(
        mate watch it, it is top class and am jealous you are getting to watch it for the first time :(
But the original has Kurosawa Tomoyo (Kumiko/Phos) as Rebecca!
    And Aoi Yuuki and Kenjiro Tsuda. Both sub and dub have amazing actors behind them.
I was switching between the sub and dub for the first 10 min because the sub felt weird for me.

The dubbed was the way to go.
Agreed. Hell, even people who doesn't like anime are praising it. That alone is saying a lot.
    Nah, that just means cyberpunk 2077 fans are also watching.
    Pretty sure that just means cyberpunk fans are watching it.
        I'm both an anime and a cyberpunk fan. I'd say edgerunners is better than ghost in the shell 2045.
            That’s not a high bar tho.
                Hey there's not much cyberpunk genre. I'll take what I can get. At long as it entertains me I'm happy. No need to set high bars for my entertainment.
Competition is stiff but definitely up there
Laughs in Chainsaw Man.
    It’s not even out yet lol
        bout to
            Has every opportunity to be shit and every opportunity to be one of the best anime in recent history, so let's wait before we keep building up expectations.
                if mappa screw this up somehow they're basically dead so i wouldn't worry too much
                    Lol business doesn't work like that
    The stuff that makes CSM AOTY material probably won’t be adapted this year
    Laugh in Fall 2022
It might have been anime of the year, but there are a few glaring issues with this show.  First, the subtitles were absolute shit.  Some  straight up not translated correctly at all with spelling errors to boot.  How you gonna pay millions of dollars for an anime to be produced and totally butcher the subs?  Also there are just too many great animes that have come out in 2022 that makes it hard for me to give this one anime of the year.  Demon slayer, AOT, and kaguya sama were all amazing, plus all the amazing fall animes like my hero or bleach.  It was good, but not anime of the year imo.
    Subtitles are hell and seem to be written by someone who doesn't know what's going on in the show. Major errors such as them -> she or other such errors which make you confused about who is taking about whom.  A lot of slang wasn't even subtitled properly and I'm watching English dub -> english subtitles, and it's not even internally consistent.  I was initially watching Japanese language with English subtitles but gave up because the Japanese script and English subtitles had so much divergence.  
  
For best effects, watch English language, English subs.
        I saw a rumor (so take with a grain of salt) that the official subs are just the script for the dub, which is why they don't make a whole lot of sense.
            Well...as the poster above you outlined, the dub was completely different than the subtitles portrayed. Things almost never lined up. So things would have had to change a LOT for the dub from scripting phase, more than usual.
nah, let's no get ahead of overselves
There's still Chainsaw man to compete against it.
    I already read the manga, it's an 8/10
        Edgerunners wasn't all that much either tbh, for me it lacked a good villain/antagonist, and the plot was a bit predictable, still pretty fun though.
        Story wise it might fall a tad short of cyberpunk but the animation they showed off for the trailer definitely should make you hold off judgement till afterwards.
            Fair enough
Nah, Lycoris Recoil, Spy x Family and Class of the elite 2 are better.

Visually CP77:ED would be deff win and it should.
    Nah, if you said Kaguya-sama, Summertime Render or Made in Abyss, I wouldn't have flat out denied. But these aren't that great, especially COTE 2.
But hey, everyone's entitled to their own opinions.
        I'd throw Summer Time Render, MiA and maybe SxF above Cyberpunk, but not Kaguya, Lyco Reco and certainly not CotE2. 

But that's what great about anime, everybody has their own opinion and that's ay okay. Also just goes to show how absolutely stacked this year has been.
            I thought everyone loved Kaguya-sama season 3, damn that's a surprise. SxF isn't really a contender for me tbh. We still got Mob Psycho, Chainsaw Man, and Golden Kamuy (actually the only one that I think might top Cyberpunk at this point) for fall.
                I didn't dislike Kaguya, I thought it was really good. I just preferred the other shows I mentioned. 

I've given MiA, Kaguya, SxF, STR and Cyberpunk all 9s on MAL actually.
                    I'm not knocking on the ranking going on in this thread, but I don't know if it's fair to rank the anime like that as they all have different styles, different genres. For instance Spy Family vs Cyberpunk. How is a fair comparison to be made.... It's hard. Like asking whether Aliens is a better movie than Titanic...
                        Yeah for sure, comparing apples to oranges. I just try to rank it in terms of overall enjoyment. Like "that was one of the tastiest apples or juiciest steaks" like Cyberpunk was a fantastic sci-fi, but comparing it to SxF doesn't really make sense unless you rank it by overall enjoyment in comparison with others in its genre.
                            Yes agree with you. But it ranks up up there for sure. I'd been slightly disappointed this summer anime... Until now! Holy shit this anime is good.
                Oh, and there's also Bleach and a re-airing of the (decent) Berserk movies in an episodic format with added and polished scenes. Great time to be an anime fan.
        Genuine question what exactly are you saying is better about cyberpunk compared to those shows? I get animation and entertainment but I can’t imagine you’re talking about the story or characters.
    COTE is absolute trash lol
    I've watched spyxfamily and while it does everything right, it doesn't do anything new or exciting.
    Nah, if you said Kaguya-sama, Summertime Render or Made in Abyss, I wouldn't have flat out denied. But these aren't that great, especially COTE 2.
But hey, everyone's entitled to their own opinions.
Anime of the goddamn *century.*
    Idk about that bud
        I was being a little hyperbolic, but honestly, now that I'm sitting down and thinking about it... there's like, only a *scattered few* things post-2000 that I'd say are better than this. FLCL, Spirited Away, Mushishi, Samurai Champloo, and Kemonozume are about it, and I would honestly go "yeah, fair" at anyone who put Edgerunners above those.

Edgerunners isn't just good, it's one of the fucking all-time GOATs.
            Again, Idk about that bud
            Watch more lmao.

Madoka Magica, Steins;Gate, Shinsekai Yori are better just off the top of my head.
                Madoka and Shinsekai Yori are up there in the same zone too, yeah, I just forgot about them.

Steins;Gate is good, but not GOAT candidate good, I feel like.
                    I feel the exact opposite. Madoka was great, but not better than Steins Gate. And Shinsekai Yori was decent but the pacing was messy.
pain, just pain
The show has a lot of Easter eggs from the game. It'll definitely enhance the experience, but your milage may vary since the game does take quite some time to finish. It is a RPG after all, so expect playtime to be dozens of hours.
    The show is cannon. It has been said in the reveal last week.
        Yep. CDPR also added some Edgerunners easter eggs in the game in the recent patch so it's 100% canon.
    To be fair, most of the value of the game can be had playing it for a few hours - enough to let the feeling and sights of night city soak in before you go watch it.

Then you go back and play the game and be like - Oh shit, I've seen this from the anime.
    [deleted]
        Not equally though. There's a lot of important characters/locations from the game that show up very briefly in the anime. You wouldn't remember them when playing the game if you watched the anime first, but you would notice them in the anime if you played the game first. 

Like Rogue shows up for 2 seconds in the anime, purely there as an easter egg for people who played the game.
nah it’s a prequel and there is some easter egg
The anime takes place before the game so you can watch it first.
Same world, but completely separate stories. Don't need to play the game to enjoy the show.
I think show>game>show is the way to go...if you like rpg's that is. It's probably 30ish hours to blast through the main story and maybe 90-110 hours to 100%. There's tons of good side content to find and cool things to see so it doesn't feel like a chore to do everything.
Not really, it's a separate story but they share the same setting and some of the people in the game are in the show but it's not super relevant to the story.
Show is canon but it does it justice. No need to play the game to understand the show.
really well put as well. im left with a hole in me too right now that i dont know how to fill and other animes aren’t doing the job :( truly a one of a kind anime and i agree with you in the game too. ive really started enjoying it recently and with the references such as the calling sound and hacking noises it just makes you want to play but every time i listen to really want to stay at your house and let you down i just feel depressed man especially when she was jogging through her memories at the end 😭😭
One of the very very few Netflix adaptations that work. This one hit it out of the park.
>I feel like cyberpunk is the anime I've been waiting for.

That's probably because it's written by a western director. I love anime but I had the same "revelation" when arcane came out. If you are used to anime writing and the way anime portrays characters and their interactions shows like edgerunner feel very different. The mature romance in this is something you rarely ever get in anime and to me it's a big part why the ending of the show is more impactful.
    I wouldn't say mature romance in anime is all that rare, it's just that a lot of romance in anime tends to be *adolescent* romance. Anime with adult casts tend to be a bit more mature about how they handle romance. Cyberpunk Edgerunners fell on the adult cast side of the spectrum so the romance element was mature.
absolutely mate top class this was and was not expecting this at all. im so glad others feel the same way as this in my eyes is a masterclass from the animating of trigger to cd’s writing and the references from the game also add to this phenomenal anime. i sadly personally dont think we will get a season 2 of edgerunner and i hope i am wrong but i am looking forward to whatever the next step in arc and characters for cyberpunks anime presents 😁
    I'd been watching rather disappointing anime all summer and this one was a total breath of fresh air, that left me all shook up.
so damn good, honestly one if my favourite in my whole time of watching anime, just the development of their relationship too, top notch 😅
    I think one of the most commendable parts of the show is just how well Lucy and David’s relationship was based on 10 episodes.
It's not like it's life changing but it's actually really good. Great action, animation, music, story, characters all wrapped up in 10 episodes. Quite a rollercoaster ride this was. A rollercoaster of a story of how hopeless the lives of people in Night City are. In the words of Johnny Silverhand from the game:

V: "I guess meant... dunno... a happy ending for everyone involved"

Johnny: "Here, for folks like us? Wrong city. Wrong people."
    Night City has a lot of tales to share. Everyone had a dream in that city. Even the shards you read too or brought up by people you meet. The side/romance stories are great too. Edgerunners really hit that spot of “Tales from Night City” vibes.
        "Another turn for the next dreamer."
    I do hope that at some point we get some kind of media involving cyberpunk that has a genuinely happy ending. Just to see how that would look like.
        Some people in the game found a way to co-exist with the city, like Doc Viktor or Misty or River ward, laying low, taking care family, not aiming high...or some people just simply leave night city and become a nomad. Not exactly the happy ending we have in mind, but i guess it's the closest thing to it people could have in that kind of world.
            Yeah, but why not a story where someone aims high and succeeds? That could be cool too.
                Yeah, its called going corpo, lmao
                I'm down with that. Nothing's wrong with seeing a choom beating the odds and rise up in NC for once.
        It's kind of hard the setting does have some happy endings but they aren't *cyberpunk* in theme, people stuck in places like night city are kind of stuck..

For example:  There's the Highriders federation which is Africa+Space colonies and it's kind of a utopia, they don't havea horrid problems with poverty/corrupt megacorps, they don't have to deal with the nuclear/climate hellhole much of earth has to, and some of their tech is decades ahead.  They aren't even **Cyberpunk** they use Bioware which are genetically engineer super organs instead of metal cyberware and they don't have cyber-psychosis.  

In a way the future of space colonization and Africa is extremely optimistic and hopeful, just Night City, the Americas'  and most of EU, Asia, and the rest of the world are stuck on earth living in a sort of post apocalyptic society after the nukes/WMD's of the 2020's.
It is good probably not as life changing as people seem to be hyping it up as I wouldn’t go into it expecting that.
Its not, from episode 1 there is nothing to care about. Pretty colors or whatever i guess.
    Nowhere near as good as the hype in my opinion.I just can't get into this. Don't really care about the characters or plot.
Nerd the shit is good , like pretty fucking good . It is a seinen so a lot of violence and some sex here and there just so you're aware. But overall one of the best animes out this year, if not the best one so far.
    Seinen is a demographic,and Cyberpunk's source material was never in any of manga magazines,if anything I whould call it an adult oriented animated show(hell I whouldn't even call it an anime,only it's animation was outsourced to Japan,the creators were polish and american..)
I think it's as good as a show can be in 10 episodes. But that also means that it can't quite measure up to shows that have more time to breathe. But yeah, seriously can't remember the last time I watched something with a runtime this short that had me that invested.
    I heavily disagree with that sentiment. Ping Pong the animation is my favorite show of all time, and a big reason for that is because it does more with the plot and the character in just 11 episodes than what most shows could do with 24. 

Its all about the density of the information. Many people like to point at the pacing because its an easy thing to notice when it gets fucked up. The key to getting a lot of good content in a short time is to actually slow the pace for a while. There isn't a single second of wasted screen time in Ping Pong, but that doesn't always mean something is happening. There are many scenes where characters just stand around to absorb a moment, giving the audience a chance to so so as well. 

Cyberpunk was all gas no breaks, but it works because its designed to be that way. When things happen, they come at you fast and out of nowhere. Much like in real life, you aren't given the opportunity to prepare for what comes next. It just gets thrown at you and you have to keep moving.
        I agree that the pacing fits and is part of it, but you don't need the same pacing for the entire show. Add a few more somber and slow-paced episodes with character development in between and it would make every character death and decision more impactful and therefor create an overall better show.

Edgerunner lacks those extra episodes but for the runtime that it has it is still amazing. The vast majority of studios would have a really hard time creating a similarly touching story in that little screentime.
ahahaha that seems to generally be the case no 😅
Asking for a slow Trigger show is like asking for a dry swimming pool. I do agree though. If you're interested in a slow-burn cyberpunk themed anime, check out Ergo Proxy if you haven't seen it.
Studio Trigger doesn't do slow. They are the hype machine after all. 

If you want a Cyberpunk themed and VERY slow story, I would recommend Texhonolyze. That's one of my favorite anime, and in many ways it acts as the exact opposite of this show.
Yea for sure man really well put imo, I didn’t understand what people meant when they said the characters were flat and the development wasn’t there when what I was watching seemed to be completely different but really hoping like I said in the OP that they make a new one wether that be next year or two years down the line with new characters and a new arc in night city as there is so much potential :)
As far as I understand, its a direct reference to the buggy nature of the cars in game. But yeah, would be hard to look at if somebody didn’t know that beforehand
Quality over quanity
When the anime ends at episode 10 you really feel dead inside. It's like I've already lived a life in night city and its killed me as a person.
    Man as someone who doesn’t vibe at all with tragedies or sad endings this thread really isn’t selling me on the show…
        Well then, I think the whole genre of cyberpunk isn't really your thing. Cyberpunk is essentially that humans are oppressed by corporations, governments and each other, and there is a powerful class while most others live barely above poverty.  As a main character in a cyberpunk setting you will try to rise above the mud but are almost always pushed back and lose in the end.  
  
The whole genre of cyberpunk fiction is like that.
            I dunno, Dimension W and Ergo Proxy were both amazing, dark in atmosphere while being overall fun and interesting. VA-11 HALL-A is also one of my favorite games every, and has a definitively lighthearted tone, if a little melancholic. Hell, even Alita: Battle Angel had distinct elements of optimism.
>	As a main character in a cyberpunk setting you will try to rise above the mud but are almost always pushed back and lose in the end.

This sounds like a defining element of [grimdark](https://youtu.be/PQAWBeFnkg8?t=5m25s) rather than cyberpunk. Not that that’s what Edgerunners is, but it seems like it’s got elements of it here and there from what I’ve heard.
Dub is better fitting imo
glad to hear mate :)
The game has been patched a lot. I went into the game with no expectations and I have been pleasantly surprised at every turn. If you come from a "zero hype" background and look at the game with fresh eyes, it's really a good game.
>To be fair, the game left a bad taste in my mouth, so I hesitated to watch it.

The anime retroactively justifies the game's existence, I'd say.
the game's production was bad. everything else is really good
Game has been super patched now. Very very good game now. Okay, crafting still sucks but the narrative and story is muack!!!
Better than the live action cowboy Bebop for sure. But the anime? Sorry anime cowboy Bebop is still better.
naaaah lil bro didnt just say that

&#x200B;

the show is fantastic but Akira and bebop are GOAT's
It's ridiculous for this day and age how much 2D is in Cyberpunk: Edgerunner. You could tell Trigger had two things not many animation studios in Japan have, TIME and MONEY, both of them at the same time.

There is some 3D in the show, but where they use it the 3D fits really well. But stuff that most modern shows would opt to use 3D for, this show does with 2D art. I was so impressed with the overall production here.
    That sounds great! I'm totally cool with some 3D being used as long as it's integrated well, but I can't stand the fully 3D stuff. Doesn't feel right to me.
        This is one of the most 2D shows you will see this year, not just this season. Only some objects and some vehicles are 3D, and half of those you probably won't even notice are 3D because of how well they are placed in the scene.
    >There is some 3D in the show

This is an understatement, there's a lot of cgi, like all vehicles are cg, and some backgrounds too, [minor spoilers]>!when David fights with the exoskeleton and during the whole car chase in the end the cg is really glaring!<
        That is not even 10%, and the way they animated the vehicles unless they spin it's very hard to notice they are 3D... talk about a blatant lie. And the only backgrounds that were 3D was when a camera was moving through said background, like every time they were showing the Arasaka tower with the camera above the whole thing. Because of the way the camera moves of course you had to do those elements in 3D. But every other background that wasn't Arasaka tower, was almost always 2D, which is a rare feat today.

And if you want to call it CG  write 3DCG, as CG means Computer Generated (CGI is Computer Generated Image) and absolutely every modern anime is ALL CG, since at the end of the day all colorind and putting all the visual elements together (and so much more) is done on a computer, thus making what comes out CG.
    Honestly I didn't like the 3d vehicles in the last episode, but everything else was nova.
        They also had a bunch of guns, especially when they were in your face, in 3D, but you only noticed that by paying very close attention (and you need a trained eye for that). The 3D vehicles at the very end were indeed the most noticeable, but that was probably more to do with the whole construction of the scene and how extensive they were used, because in previous scenes despite using the same tech, the 3D was not easy to spot. I think what go to you was the animation, in previous scenes vehicles were animated differently, as if they were 2D assets, while the animation for the car chase at the end was a lot smoother, and thus made the 3DCG more obvious.

Honestly it could have just as well been a situation where for the amount of vehicles they had in those scenes, there just wasn't enough time to individually key frame animate the cars, like they had done previously.
it is an actual anime i 100% recommend you do! i was skeptical at first but extremely glad i did in the end. lucky you are getting to watch it for the first time :(
    I'll look into it! 👍
    What platform streams it?
        Netflix and only Netflix
            Thanks!
CGI is "actual anime".
    CGI anime is a disease
        Have you actually watched any that aren't considered bad?
            What would you recommend?
                Houseki no Kuni and Beastars are definitely high quality CGI. I'd check one of those out.
                    Don't forget Dorohedoro
                        Framerate is a little choppy for something I would wanna use to convince someone that CGI can look good.
        Gatekeeping is a disease
No it's not , the table top is awesome and they fixed the video game up pretty well. Right now it is pretty enjoyable
    Nah the game is still mid. It had bigger problems than bugs.
        mid=trash?
            Obviously you’ve never heard of hyperbole.
doesnt mean it has bad characters, settings, lore, and story. the production was just a failure.
    Neither of you are right.
        what then?
    Nah take away the bugs, the game was still mid. The story was bland. That doesn’t mean it couldn’t be improved upon but it’s still unexpected taking something mid making it better.
I suddenly want to make a sandevistan build.
If they do attempt to make more, I hope it's an anthology type thing. I've seen some people suggest a series based on Trauma Team, and I feel like that could work
    Yea I'd be on board with that! Or possibly show the evolution and backstory of one of the random mooks our protagonists encountered and tangled with. The urinating Cyber-psychosis dude for instance, be weird to follow his origin story lol
        ahahaha that would be funny af. he had mil cyberware so who knows where he got it from
[deleted]
    I can't help myself, it's just so good! It's almost like I'm hoping it will change or something, but I know it wont.
[deleted]
    Same, I want to know what's going on with Lucy and Falco. It would be so cool if they somehow ended up back in the game or another story somewhere down the line. 

Hell, I'm more interested in this story than the regular game to be honest. Johnny was cool, but never felt like I cared for him, I want a crew like the show or beginning of the game.
For me it was already a bittersweet song anyway. I (male v) grew super attached to Judy in my first playthrough and when that song would be on the radio it made me think of her. Then the let down happens later in her story and the song always gave me accepting-but-crushed feelings since. 😂
What’s the name of the song?
    i really wanna stay at your house ahahaha
I feel you
I’ve connected the song to the moon scene. For me signifies how all good things come to an end but you should still pursue your goals. Bittersweet for sure
Did you not notice the songs use in key scenes in Edgerunners? People are now linking those scenes with the song in their mind. Big Sad.
no wonder it's so good
Trigger studio produced*
I’m like 4 episodes in, and there’s good reason for it, might be the first time ever that the show is better than the source material in terms of video game anime adaptations
    How the turntables huh
        yep. usually with game-adapted anime we will get the usual low quality shows which always fail the source materials but this anime is a much better experience than what the game could offer.
    Very rare that those things happen. The only other one I can recall is that the author of Fight Club the book thought that Fight Club the movie had a much stronger ending.
Yeah , that kinda kills the hype . The show " Vampire in the Garden " it's short but really good as well but since Netflix releases the whole thing in one go it never really gives the shows time to become more popular through general discussion of it in the communities.
    Stranger Things is popular and that had all the episodes released at once. More like anime community isn't the best place to discuss when we are going through a blitz of post. Also need to give people time to watch it. Not everyone likes to binge watch
        Stranger things initially premiered at a time when streaming services were just becoming dominant and "Netflix Original" still was a brand that was batting 1000. The idea of dropping a season all at once was still this novel thing and it happened in a much much less saturated market. Today, there are way more shows dropping seasons all at once (And then flipping a coin to see if they're cancelled). Unless you have already got an entrenched audience from the Before Times like Stranger things, it's harder to demand attention this way anymore.
    I think the anime community is a bit too hype oriented. How do other fandoms operate around it? Video games don't have seasons, they all come out at once. So does a lot of other stuff. But discussions still happen weeks or even months after a game's release.

I think the real problem is the anime community as a whole and this sub have gotten a bit too dependent on the seasonal cycle of weekly discussion, and can't operate outside of hype and bandwagoning. By the time people have binged all the episodes of Edgerunner, the community would have already moved on to the next shiny season. It's kinda self limiting and people often forget about the stuff they were hyping just last season.
        Well, that's what happens when there's so *much* anime and so much of it is at least good (but so little is genuinely great).
        I think the biggest reason is that the majority of the anime community just moves on. There's always a new show to talk about instead.
        > Video games don't have seasons, they all come out at once. So does a lot of other stuff. But discussions still happen weeks or even months after a game's release.

Because there's more than a few hours of content in games usually.  If there isn't, then there is at least tactics and strategies, they have replay value, or the discussion just dies.

Also, games rarely come out all at once at this point.  They are either missing features that are added later or there is DLC that probably could've just been part of the original game.
            If anime is shorter than a video game, shouldn't that make it easier for people to discuss an anime that released all at once compared to a 50+ hour game? I don't really see the difference you're trying to point out. Months have passed and people are still finding new things in Elden Ring. Similarly, in manga communities like One Piece, Attack on Titan or Made in Abyss, people are discovering new things and discussing with the community everyday.

We don't have that in the anime community, everyone's attention span only works for 12 weeks at a time. Weekly discussions are so limiting, and if I try discussing something like Vinland Saga, people are gonna be like "are we still in 2019?"
                > Similarly, in manga communities like One Piece, Attack on Titan or Made in Abyss, people are discovering new things and discussing with the community everyday.

That's a bad example for your case. A lot of manga discussion runs around the fact that there's an ongoing cycle (weekly, monthly,...), there's a lot more One Piece discussion when there's a One Piece chapter. On the other hand, a finished manga like Monster will get mentioned about as much as its anime, once in a blue moon. 

Even AoT which still gets more discussion is mostly fuelled by the controversial ending, memes, and the upcoming final final final season.
                    Fair point. But you're kind of dismissing the AoT discussion. Do you think r/anime is gonna talk about the controversial ending months after AoT wraps up, like the manga community did? Or do you think it'll be a 1 week controversy before everyone moves onto discussing the next season?
                        Hmm I don't think we'll see threads discussing it every week, but it's something that will sink into public awareness for sure and get brought up commonly.

I'd compare it to Wonder Egg Priority. It wasn't the most popular show, but its ending still left a strong lasting effect, that it gets brought up every once in a while. I imagine AoT will have something similar, on a much larger scale, I mean already it keeps getting brought up on r/anime by manga readers.
        Isn't it the lack of marketing for anime in the west?
        Having a pinned weekly discussion thread would go a long way. People talk about batch releases killing discussion, but I think far more of the problem is their discussion forums of choice. Or more accurately that they're not forums
        Meanwhile there's me who waits for entire cours to finish and then binges them in 3 days because I'm fuckin done with cliffhangers. I appreciate Netflix cutting out the middleman.
        I mean, it's a lot easier to discuss one thing at a time rather then 12, and there needs some time to digest and analyze everything you see.
            I see your point. But the same applies to video games. And even now, years later, I still see discussions and YouTube videos about games that came out long ago. Elden Ring came out months ago and people are still discovering and analyzing new things.

Meanwhile the anime community has a 12 week window of analysis, and after that they're already moving onto another show. For example, a show like Attack on Titan, there's just so much going on that you can't analyze that in one season. The manga community is always finding stuff that happened many chapters ago and connecting it with newer information.

Meanwhile the anime community just stops talking about it once the season ends, very few in the community dig deeper into shows long after they've finished airing. A show like Odd Taxi for example, gets better on rewatch after you know what happens in the last episode, but by that point people aren't around to discuss it anymore because the new season along with new hype trains have started.
        > Video games don't have seasons, they all come out at once. So does a lot of other stuff. But discussions still happen weeks or even months after a game's release.

Videogames are more hype based than any medium  and they discussion tends to die fairly quickly (ofc based on its length) for single player games that do not have DLC. Let's remember that the average for beating a videogame does not reach 30%.

And they do have seasons. Some are DLC for single player experiences, like cyberpunk recent boom caused by the dlc + sale of the base game, others are actually called season (gamepass included) for the game as a service trend for multiplayer games.
        >Video games don't have seasons

I mean actually a lot of the most popular video games **do** have seasons now.
        > Video games don't have seasons, they all come out at once.

*Destiny sweating profusely*
    My theory is that the weekly release schedule vs batch release is actually the smaller issue, and the big problem with batch releases is that their release often doesn't align with the start of a new season.

Conventional wisdom would dictate that you should release your show when nothing else comes out. Anime is still strongly bound to seasons though, so fans will, unsurprisingly, look for new shows when there's actually new shows to watch.

Additionally, these shows also don't get featured in Anituber seasonal recommendations, since they're not out by the time the video is made, and too old when the new season rolls around.

ReLIFE for example was a batch release that aligned with the Summer 2016 season and didn't get overlooked.
    Vampire in the garden was okay imo
    Does the opposite for a lot of people, I for one hate watching weekly and can get a lot more hyped when I can watch something as fast or as slow as I want. Weeklies just annihilates any sense of pacing to me.
    Honestly I think Edgerunners was better served by being released in a bingeable format. I think releasing weekly would have been a huge mistake with some of the big shows on the horizon. A lot of attention is going to be on stuff like Chainsaw Man and Spy X Family S2 soon.

Plus Edgerunners was really designed to be released in that format from the start and you can tell. If you were to watch it by just one episode a week it would start really, really slow and not be a good indicator of what the rest of the show is.
        Interesting opinion to be honest ,I believe that "longer exposure = more viewership " but I honestly never considered competition from heavy hitters ( this fall season is going to be bonkers)
            Mind you I think Cyberpunk is a unique scenario with it, because its a kind of sleeper hit. I dont think pre release anyone expected it to be as good as it is.

As a fan of not only the tabletop source material, cyberpunk 2020, and the game Cyberpunk 2077, and having watched several Trigger projects. I didnt even think it'd be this good.

So if it was drawn out over a weekly schedule over the course of 10 weeks and then had to go up against Spy x Family, Chainsaw Man, etc. I just dont think it would have grabbed the traction it currently has.
[nah, they released 10 discussion posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/xd0lld/cyberpunk_edgerunners_episode_10_discussion/) but there is a good chance they just got lost in the shuffle.
nah bruh saw alot of post about this show on MAL stop the cap and shut up with this weekly shit it old
Episode one, ok I’m bingeing this. It was 2am so kindda passed out and only have 2 episodes left, already dreading the end cuz I’m going to want more. 

The world, the characters, the animation, the music, this anime is one of the best I’ve seen in a very long time.
that has less to do with the fact the origin is video game, and more to do with dragon quest not being that popular outside of Japan
    Well everyone outside of Japan should stop being snobs and play Dragon Quest then.
        I feel like every gamer should play at least one Dragon Quest game in thier lives, there's just something about it that hits different despite being so traditional.

Thankfully Dragon Quest 11 is on basically every platform now, with only the PS4 not having the definitive edition. 

Considering the games have changes platforms constantly, right now is arguably the easiest it has ever been to get into the series-esspecially since DQ11 is one of the best.
        [deleted]
            I respectfully disagree. Toriyama style also works well for Dragon Quest.
        For those that like jrpgs, sure. But that genre is niche so you can not expect all kind of players to try it.
Dragon Quest Adventure of Dai has been a favorite of mine as of late, truly the best reboot anime aside from Fruits Basket.

It's almost over, and I'm sort of sad to see it go.

Also Popp, Hyunkel, Hadlar, and of course, Dai have all become some of my favorite characters.

Popp in particular is an example of some of the best character growth I have ever seen on an anime.

It is a *crime* that more people aren't watching it, or haven't been watching it for so long when it is about to end at episode 100.
I'm in complete agreement with you. It's so visually appealing to watch but the story is fairly messy and doesn't make a ton of sense at points. Like it was trying to be deeper in its plot than it actually really was or even needed to be which just made it super confusing to follow at times. Especially at the end where it sometimes went from Point A to Point C without exploring Point B (without getting too spoiler heavy, Feredey and Kiwi's talk about Lucy in the beginning of Episode 9 really irked me and made no sense whatsoever; makes it hard to know or follow the story they were presenting when they pull stuff out of their ass like that). Should've just kept it simple instead of going for some grand script they couldn't quite deliver on.
    What was the grand script? It was a fairly simple story.
I think Cyber Punk was already an established law before CDPR brought out the half arsed game same with witchery
    No, the game has all new lore, and the anime uses that. The story itself was written by CDPR.

2020 called though, they want their hater bandwagon back.
        They scammed me as well as a lot of others I've got a right to be a hater I think
            > They scammed me

How did they scam you? I mean, you definitely waited until it released and reviews came out before buying, right? Certainly you didn't pre-pay for a product that doesn't exist solely on the faith that a company wouldn't fuck up, right?

They released a bad product, but they didn't scam you.
            You're one of those that dreamed up a perfect GTA clone and got mad when you didn't get it? Okay.
                Yeah that's right completely dismiss the valid reason I have to dislike the company. It was a shit show I'm glad they've not given up on it completely but when you scam your customers you reap what you sow
                    You're free to dislike the game and the company. But most people calling them scammers are complaining about promises that were never made or features that were explicitly cut before release.
                        [deleted]
                            The game ran like shit on previous gen and deserves all the criticism, but the game itself was great on PC and next gen.

You're free to dislike the game, I don't really care about anyone's opinion tbh, what irks me is the fact that people like you keep bringing up promises that were never made, like GTA sandbox features, when the game is very obviously a story driven RPG.

You said It here, the features you "expected". Just because the game takes place in a city, doesn't mean It's meant to be a sandbox like GTA. People dreamed up a game and got mad when their fantasy didn't become reality.
                I love Cyberpunk but this isn’t a fair assessment, they quite clearly marketed it as a perfect GTA clone; I’m not gonna say that all the backlash that CDPR got was warranted but a good chunk of it definitely was
                    No, it wasn't, at all. If you watched clickbait videos dreaming up the ultimate game, maybe. But this was always an RPG first, like the Witcher. This is what I'm talking about.

Edit: A guy commented and instantly blocked me about this. Holy shit, you people have some issues.
                        The RPG side of CP2077 is the worst aspect of it lmfao. 

You're dickriding way too much, I'm sorry your game failed and they had to spend 2 years making it decent. I'm sorry you're only getting 1 dlc before they jump ship to Witcher 4. I'm sorry you have to sit out here running defense for a company that will never care about you.
To be faaaiiirrrr🎶
You nailed it.

Like, I get it.  I *honestly* do; as a woman, I'm socialized to empathize with men in media.  The character archetype Lucy belongs to is a salve designed to address male insecurities about not feeling special, unique, or important.

While I'm sure it's incredibly helpful to young men to see characters like that in media, and work through (and/or languish in) that insecurity in the shared mediaspace, to me it's kinda boring.  And repetitive.  And honestly more depressing the more you think about it.  

Because the takeaway message for me and other women is kind of the opposite.  That I *am* special, but my special calling is to have some boy glom onto me like an imprinted duckling, at which point, I become solely responsible for his social development. 

I just wish filmmakers cared about my insecurities this much.  

I still liked Edgerunners a lot.  Imaishi is REALLY good at his job.  But I would have liked to like it just a little bit more.
I'm... actually not going to go bluehairedfeminist on Becca.  

Maybe I could, maybe I should, maybe you expect me to, maybe **not** having anything to say about Becca reflects poorly of me to all the other cool feminists, but nah.  Got nothing. 

Thought she was a short young adult.  

Maybe if it was Melissa Fahn or Christina "Vee" Valenzuela's voice and not Alex Cazares, I might have had a different reaction.  But Alex's performance really sells a sense of lived frustration with her body and how her presentation prehudices others that's festered for 20+ years.

Some adults are just short.  I'm not mad about this one. 

I'm more annoyed that she "competes" for the affection of the audience surrogate character.  I'm kind of over that trope, feel like I've gotten more than a lifetime's fill.
X2 don't
Yes…yes.
Yoooo same here, was caught up in some bugs in the first 24-48 hours and then told myself i'll come back in a week/month when they fix things up. 

Not sure why I haven't got back too either....
    Feel like shit that I preordered a PS4 disk version...
Can't unsee it now.
The story is by CDPR but the rest of the show (including the script) is full Trigger and if you've seen Imaishi's other work, it's very similar.
If they worked on it, theyre part of the team. So the credit definitely goes to Trigger.  


Besides, the production team has the final call on how to translate script to animation.
> they only worked on animation and character design and got approved from CdPR. Ost, story was all from CDPR writers.

I mean you do remind people of CDPR's involvement on the project which I appreciate, but the split of work you present here is much harsher than it is in reality.

The original story is definitely from CDPR's side, but as other people have mentioned, Trigger was involved already on the script. Simply going by the opening credits we have:

From CDPR: Mike Pondsmith credited on creation of the Cyberpunk 2077 universe, another creation credit on Rafal Jaki, while the screen story is credited on Bartosz Sztybor.

From Trigger: Both creators credited on script, Masahiko Otsuka and Yoshiki Usa, are Trigger adjacent, and Hiromi Wakabayashi who is credited for "creative support" has always been involved on the narrative side of Trigger productions.

Of course, credits can often give a fairly vague idea of what the tasks ultimately were, but [this video](https://streamable.com/goylj2) linked on this thread demonstrates that Trigger already influenced the story in such central aspects as the composition of the main cast of the story. Also, to my understanding the anime uses songs from the franchise, but the ost itself is by Akira Yamaoka (no prior association to either company) and sound director, the person who along with director decides on the usage of soundtrack, is Hiroki Urakari, who has worked previously in Trigger projects.

Of course, another paragraph could be made on CDPR creators' involvement on the visual side - and *even a longer, slightly hypocritical one* could be made on how crediting different aspects of creative works on companies rather than individuals isn't ideal in general.

Anyway, the fundamental tl;dr point was that things aren't that black and white.
Writer for the game right? Because I don't see the author getting into something like this.
    Yes witcher 3 the wild hunt. The author only did the books
It was visually stunning as expected tho. They know what they can do and they do it well
I might watch this then, with the comfort of knowing aliens won't show up 2 episodes before the end.
source?
    Check cdpr yt channel
I lost it when David said "So you guys... are Cyberpunks"
    I got goosebumps when he said "it's edgerunnin' time!"
        Best line was when he said he was built different
            Im glad im not the only one that that line stood out to
            The best part is I'm pretty sure several of these lines actually did get said and non of it made me roll my eyes.
            my friends all lost it at that line, had to pause our viewing party to laugh for a good minute
        That line was never actually said unlike the other two lines.  
The real line was "it's edgin' time"
What, they wanted to cut Rebecca?  So glad Trigger held their ground on this.
Hey what is this from? I'm curious to watch more.
    They did a stream the day before release streaming the first 3 episodes and some discussion. Unfortunately the vod is gone now so you'll have to search if someone reuploaded it somewhere, I had a quick look and didn't find it but it's probably out there somewhere.
[deleted]
    Reminds me how in the VN VA-11 Hall-A which also has a cyberpunk setting there's a character who's a sex worker android and she chose to stay with her younger body not getting an upgrade to appeal to that certain "market". It's weird but thinking about it of course there's be shit like this...
I think that might be the joke.
    Then Woosh on me
        I don't want to whoosh on you. Only when the time.... Is right.
I mean, both are great
Odd take.
Oh yeah the street lingo is def something that works better with EN since it was originally written in EN.
I'm definitely not someone that's familiar with Japanese, but even I can say the subs are total shit in some scenes. 

Half the calls they make don't even translate properly, I don't know which call but I'm pretty sure the whole convo goes very differently from what the on-screen text (call hologram) shows. 

That said, you're pretty much going to understand it all if you're a regular anime sub watcher.
I haven't checked but apparently the English captions for the English dub have been fixed. Also, there are seperate english subtitles that are meant for the Japanese dub, which don't have those errors.
    The separate subtitles for the Japanese dub still suck.
Also, the dub has Giancarlo Esposito. Nuff said.
Need to hear Giancarlo's sexy voice too!
It's also all the different accents too. NC is incredibly diverse and that shines through much better in the dub imo.
Rewatched in Dub recently. I haven't said this in a LONG time, but the Dub is just objectively far better than the sub for the reasons that you've already mentioned. 

And as you already said, this anime is extremely well made and it's a crime how much the subs distract you. Generally it's the ground or whatever uninteresting stuff that's there at the bottom of the screen, but edgerunners made the fucking street garbage look world class.

Like what the fuck Studio Trigger? xD

Amazing experience, still in the high from when it released.
There are two characters that don't speak English. Which is even funnier in the Japanese dub because the subtitles just say "in japanese" despite everyone speaking japanese.
Damn people can't have preferences anymore.
    Lol you miss the point
I was shocked to see that the Japanese was the original cause until I saw that, I was under the impression of the opposite lol
The jaoanese voice acting was fine but the subs were absolute garbage and at times made no sense at all.
    The actors themselves are great, but so were the English VAs, and English felt more natural in night city.
Lmao, or you're a fast reader and it doesn't detract in any way to listen to the originally cast va's
    I can literally speak fluent Japanese. English is the way to go here. The English cast is objectively better, and hearing them use similarish words in Japanese to what the real script obviously is (aka cyberpunk lingo) is just bad
        That's nice, but I've heard both, and the Japanese VA is strictly better imo. David especially, his English VA is flat as fuck. Rebecca is also 1000 times better jp
Dude she did not deserve to go out like that. Like out of everyone I think she got the rawest deal. At least the main two got a period of raw bliss. Sure they were worried about each other, but they had it. Same with Maine and Dopio. Becca got sold out by her friend (which ultimately lead to all their deaths), while dealing with the grief of her brother’s death and unrequited love for a guy that she has to watch die in order to save someone else.
The biggest villain in this anime is late stage capitalism
Maybe if you add the context from the game, but I don't think that it was that well conveyed in the anime (specially give that it was a short story), maybe if becomes an anthology series they could flesh out that more, but as an anime only I don't see it.
    I thought it was well conveyed and I've never played the game. I got it the moment [Edgerunners spoilers]>!David's mom was processed and forgotten about like a used soda tin can!<
I still can't believe his level caps at 30 unless you're doing the "Don't fear the Reaper" route
Despite seeing a bunch of similar comments to this he feels absolutely menacing to someone who just started the game after watching the show.
    theyve buffed him up quite abit in the newest update
V is a pretty much a monster at the end of the game, it's kinda funny with the silent takedown V just unplug Adam smasher to death tho.
[deleted]
    What's the point of armor in a show where characters can cleave through iron like it's paper.
Don't fear the reaper route is best ending for real, the second V grabbed Johnny's hand and the silverhand theme kicks in. doom music vibes
That’s good too hear! I haven’t watched those but I probably should as I always hear good things about them
I've never encountered another person who's seen Diebuster in the wild.
    It's incredibly underseen and more people need to watch it.
        What's about
Scene pacing is definitely very imaishi. At the end of the day the director has a huge input on pacing and storytelling no matter the script.
    Trigger also has script writing credit, so it's difficult to say who did what and how much
I have, I enjoyed the soundtrack and writing but couldn't really get behind the art style as much as CP77, Trigger did a phenomenal job.
i prefer edgerunners over arcane, though theyre both great. edgerunners soundtrack shits all over arcanes sountrack tho, having to listen to imagine dragons in pivotal scenes made me irrationally mad
    Yeah indeed.
Dorohedoro criminally underrated.

    What is dorohoro about
        It's... hard to explain but basically it's about this guy named Kaiman, an amnesic man disfigured by Magic who tries to recover both his original face and memories about his past.

And the adventures he encounters trying to reach that point.

This link explains the plot better:

Arcane, Castlevania are not anime, japanese studios didn't produce them. They don't have entries on anime db's like mal etc.
    According you
        According to me, anime community and definition of what "Anime" is. Go check any Anime DB and see what entries they have registered, you won't find these but cyberpunk is there coz Trigger a jp studio produced it.
            >According to me

Worthless 

>anime community and definition of what "Anime" is.

There is no consensus, stupid .

>Go check any Anime DB and see what entries they have registered,

I won't,  that shit ain't an anime authority. 

Don't reply kid , I could only care for your opinion if I were getting paid to hear it .
                You're just a dumbass baboon with 2 braincells
        Hell even just check this place r/anime, there are no discussion threads or anything, that should tell your dumb brain something.
>Castlevanias, Devilman Crybaby

Ooooohhh, you've got a point there. These are two of my recent favorites too. That said, Edgerunners even blows them out of the water IMO. Maybe its just a perfect storm scenario as it appeals to so many of my anime and anime adjacent interests. 

\-Ah yeah, definitely. I just bought it. It's actually going for 50% off on the PS Store atm
Nice. I like Arcane and that love death robot too. So I guess this can be a good sign.
    Okay now I finished the show and I just dont know what to say. In my opinion the show is really well made and definitly worth a watch. The Animation, the soundtrack and the characters are just perfect. And I really agree with OP, now I’m feeling empty
        welcome to the club homie ;(
    mate watch it, it is top class and am jealous you are getting to watch it for the first time :(
And Aoi Yuuki and Kenjiro Tsuda. Both sub and dub have amazing actors behind them.
Nah, that just means cyberpunk 2077 fans are also watching.
Pretty sure that just means cyberpunk fans are watching it.
    I'm both an anime and a cyberpunk fan. I'd say edgerunners is better than ghost in the shell 2045.
        That’s not a high bar tho.
            Hey there's not much cyberpunk genre. I'll take what I can get. At long as it entertains me I'm happy. No need to set high bars for my entertainment.
It’s not even out yet lol
    bout to
        Has every opportunity to be shit and every opportunity to be one of the best anime in recent history, so let's wait before we keep building up expectations.
            if mappa screw this up somehow they're basically dead so i wouldn't worry too much
                Lol business doesn't work like that
The stuff that makes CSM AOTY material probably won’t be adapted this year
Laugh in Fall 2022
Subtitles are hell and seem to be written by someone who doesn't know what's going on in the show. Major errors such as them -> she or other such errors which make you confused about who is taking about whom.  A lot of slang wasn't even subtitled properly and I'm watching English dub -> english subtitles, and it's not even internally consistent.  I was initially watching Japanese language with English subtitles but gave up because the Japanese script and English subtitles had so much divergence.  
  
For best effects, watch English language, English subs.
    I saw a rumor (so take with a grain of salt) that the official subs are just the script for the dub, which is why they don't make a whole lot of sense.
        Well...as the poster above you outlined, the dub was completely different than the subtitles portrayed. Things almost never lined up. So things would have had to change a LOT for the dub from scripting phase, more than usual.
I already read the manga, it's an 8/10
    Edgerunners wasn't all that much either tbh, for me it lacked a good villain/antagonist, and the plot was a bit predictable, still pretty fun though.
    Story wise it might fall a tad short of cyberpunk but the animation they showed off for the trailer definitely should make you hold off judgement till afterwards.
        Fair enough
Nah, if you said Kaguya-sama, Summertime Render or Made in Abyss, I wouldn't have flat out denied. But these aren't that great, especially COTE 2.
But hey, everyone's entitled to their own opinions.
    I'd throw Summer Time Render, MiA and maybe SxF above Cyberpunk, but not Kaguya, Lyco Reco and certainly not CotE2. 

But that's what great about anime, everybody has their own opinion and that's ay okay. Also just goes to show how absolutely stacked this year has been.
        I thought everyone loved Kaguya-sama season 3, damn that's a surprise. SxF isn't really a contender for me tbh. We still got Mob Psycho, Chainsaw Man, and Golden Kamuy (actually the only one that I think might top Cyberpunk at this point) for fall.
            I didn't dislike Kaguya, I thought it was really good. I just preferred the other shows I mentioned. 

I've given MiA, Kaguya, SxF, STR and Cyberpunk all 9s on MAL actually.
                I'm not knocking on the ranking going on in this thread, but I don't know if it's fair to rank the anime like that as they all have different styles, different genres. For instance Spy Family vs Cyberpunk. How is a fair comparison to be made.... It's hard. Like asking whether Aliens is a better movie than Titanic...
                    Yeah for sure, comparing apples to oranges. I just try to rank it in terms of overall enjoyment. Like "that was one of the tastiest apples or juiciest steaks" like Cyberpunk was a fantastic sci-fi, but comparing it to SxF doesn't really make sense unless you rank it by overall enjoyment in comparison with others in its genre.
                        Yes agree with you. But it ranks up up there for sure. I'd been slightly disappointed this summer anime... Until now! Holy shit this anime is good.
            Oh, and there's also Bleach and a re-airing of the (decent) Berserk movies in an episodic format with added and polished scenes. Great time to be an anime fan.
    Genuine question what exactly are you saying is better about cyberpunk compared to those shows? I get animation and entertainment but I can’t imagine you’re talking about the story or characters.
COTE is absolute trash lol
I've watched spyxfamily and while it does everything right, it doesn't do anything new or exciting.
Nah, if you said Kaguya-sama, Summertime Render or Made in Abyss, I wouldn't have flat out denied. But these aren't that great, especially COTE 2.
But hey, everyone's entitled to their own opinions.
Idk about that bud
    I was being a little hyperbolic, but honestly, now that I'm sitting down and thinking about it... there's like, only a *scattered few* things post-2000 that I'd say are better than this. FLCL, Spirited Away, Mushishi, Samurai Champloo, and Kemonozume are about it, and I would honestly go "yeah, fair" at anyone who put Edgerunners above those.

Edgerunners isn't just good, it's one of the fucking all-time GOATs.
        Again, Idk about that bud
        Watch more lmao.

Madoka Magica, Steins;Gate, Shinsekai Yori are better just off the top of my head.
            Madoka and Shinsekai Yori are up there in the same zone too, yeah, I just forgot about them.

Steins;Gate is good, but not GOAT candidate good, I feel like.
                I feel the exact opposite. Madoka was great, but not better than Steins Gate. And Shinsekai Yori was decent but the pacing was messy.
The show is cannon. It has been said in the reveal last week.
    Yep. CDPR also added some Edgerunners easter eggs in the game in the recent patch so it's 100% canon.
To be fair, most of the value of the game can be had playing it for a few hours - enough to let the feeling and sights of night city soak in before you go watch it.

Then you go back and play the game and be like - Oh shit, I've seen this from the anime.
[deleted]
    Not equally though. There's a lot of important characters/locations from the game that show up very briefly in the anime. You wouldn't remember them when playing the game if you watched the anime first, but you would notice them in the anime if you played the game first. 

Like Rogue shows up for 2 seconds in the anime, purely there as an easter egg for people who played the game.
I wouldn't say mature romance in anime is all that rare, it's just that a lot of romance in anime tends to be *adolescent* romance. Anime with adult casts tend to be a bit more mature about how they handle romance. Cyberpunk Edgerunners fell on the adult cast side of the spectrum so the romance element was mature.
I'd been watching rather disappointing anime all summer and this one was a total breath of fresh air, that left me all shook up.
I think one of the most commendable parts of the show is just how well Lucy and David’s relationship was based on 10 episodes.
Night City has a lot of tales to share. Everyone had a dream in that city. Even the shards you read too or brought up by people you meet. The side/romance stories are great too. Edgerunners really hit that spot of “Tales from Night City” vibes.
    "Another turn for the next dreamer."
I do hope that at some point we get some kind of media involving cyberpunk that has a genuinely happy ending. Just to see how that would look like.
    Some people in the game found a way to co-exist with the city, like Doc Viktor or Misty or River ward, laying low, taking care family, not aiming high...or some people just simply leave night city and become a nomad. Not exactly the happy ending we have in mind, but i guess it's the closest thing to it people could have in that kind of world.
        Yeah, but why not a story where someone aims high and succeeds? That could be cool too.
            Yeah, its called going corpo, lmao
            I'm down with that. Nothing's wrong with seeing a choom beating the odds and rise up in NC for once.
    It's kind of hard the setting does have some happy endings but they aren't *cyberpunk* in theme, people stuck in places like night city are kind of stuck..

For example:  There's the Highriders federation which is Africa+Space colonies and it's kind of a utopia, they don't havea horrid problems with poverty/corrupt megacorps, they don't have to deal with the nuclear/climate hellhole much of earth has to, and some of their tech is decades ahead.  They aren't even **Cyberpunk** they use Bioware which are genetically engineer super organs instead of metal cyberware and they don't have cyber-psychosis.  

In a way the future of space colonization and Africa is extremely optimistic and hopeful, just Night City, the Americas'  and most of EU, Asia, and the rest of the world are stuck on earth living in a sort of post apocalyptic society after the nukes/WMD's of the 2020's.
Nowhere near as good as the hype in my opinion.I just can't get into this. Don't really care about the characters or plot.
Seinen is a demographic,and Cyberpunk's source material was never in any of manga magazines,if anything I whould call it an adult oriented animated show(hell I whouldn't even call it an anime,only it's animation was outsourced to Japan,the creators were polish and american..)
I heavily disagree with that sentiment. Ping Pong the animation is my favorite show of all time, and a big reason for that is because it does more with the plot and the character in just 11 episodes than what most shows could do with 24. 

Its all about the density of the information. Many people like to point at the pacing because its an easy thing to notice when it gets fucked up. The key to getting a lot of good content in a short time is to actually slow the pace for a while. There isn't a single second of wasted screen time in Ping Pong, but that doesn't always mean something is happening. There are many scenes where characters just stand around to absorb a moment, giving the audience a chance to so so as well. 

Cyberpunk was all gas no breaks, but it works because its designed to be that way. When things happen, they come at you fast and out of nowhere. Much like in real life, you aren't given the opportunity to prepare for what comes next. It just gets thrown at you and you have to keep moving.
    I agree that the pacing fits and is part of it, but you don't need the same pacing for the entire show. Add a few more somber and slow-paced episodes with character development in between and it would make every character death and decision more impactful and therefor create an overall better show.

Edgerunner lacks those extra episodes but for the runtime that it has it is still amazing. The vast majority of studios would have a really hard time creating a similarly touching story in that little screentime.
Man as someone who doesn’t vibe at all with tragedies or sad endings this thread really isn’t selling me on the show…
    Well then, I think the whole genre of cyberpunk isn't really your thing. Cyberpunk is essentially that humans are oppressed by corporations, governments and each other, and there is a powerful class while most others live barely above poverty.  As a main character in a cyberpunk setting you will try to rise above the mud but are almost always pushed back and lose in the end.  
  
The whole genre of cyberpunk fiction is like that.
        I dunno, Dimension W and Ergo Proxy were both amazing, dark in atmosphere while being overall fun and interesting. VA-11 HALL-A is also one of my favorite games every, and has a definitively lighthearted tone, if a little melancholic. Hell, even Alita: Battle Angel had distinct elements of optimism.
>	As a main character in a cyberpunk setting you will try to rise above the mud but are almost always pushed back and lose in the end.

This sounds like a defining element of [grimdark](https://youtu.be/PQAWBeFnkg8?t=5m25s) rather than cyberpunk. Not that that’s what Edgerunners is, but it seems like it’s got elements of it here and there from what I’ve heard.
That sounds great! I'm totally cool with some 3D being used as long as it's integrated well, but I can't stand the fully 3D stuff. Doesn't feel right to me.
    This is one of the most 2D shows you will see this year, not just this season. Only some objects and some vehicles are 3D, and half of those you probably won't even notice are 3D because of how well they are placed in the scene.
>There is some 3D in the show

This is an understatement, there's a lot of cgi, like all vehicles are cg, and some backgrounds too, [minor spoilers]>!when David fights with the exoskeleton and during the whole car chase in the end the cg is really glaring!<
    That is not even 10%, and the way they animated the vehicles unless they spin it's very hard to notice they are 3D... talk about a blatant lie. And the only backgrounds that were 3D was when a camera was moving through said background, like every time they were showing the Arasaka tower with the camera above the whole thing. Because of the way the camera moves of course you had to do those elements in 3D. But every other background that wasn't Arasaka tower, was almost always 2D, which is a rare feat today.

And if you want to call it CG  write 3DCG, as CG means Computer Generated (CGI is Computer Generated Image) and absolutely every modern anime is ALL CG, since at the end of the day all colorind and putting all the visual elements together (and so much more) is done on a computer, thus making what comes out CG.
Honestly I didn't like the 3d vehicles in the last episode, but everything else was nova.
    They also had a bunch of guns, especially when they were in your face, in 3D, but you only noticed that by paying very close attention (and you need a trained eye for that). The 3D vehicles at the very end were indeed the most noticeable, but that was probably more to do with the whole construction of the scene and how extensive they were used, because in previous scenes despite using the same tech, the 3D was not easy to spot. I think what go to you was the animation, in previous scenes vehicles were animated differently, as if they were 2D assets, while the animation for the car chase at the end was a lot smoother, and thus made the 3DCG more obvious.

Honestly it could have just as well been a situation where for the amount of vehicles they had in those scenes, there just wasn't enough time to individually key frame animate the cars, like they had done previously.
I'll look into it! 👍
What platform streams it?
    Netflix and only Netflix
        Thanks!
CGI anime is a disease
    Have you actually watched any that aren't considered bad?
        What would you recommend?
            Houseki no Kuni and Beastars are definitely high quality CGI. I'd check one of those out.
                Don't forget Dorohedoro
                    Framerate is a little choppy for something I would wanna use to convince someone that CGI can look good.
    Gatekeeping is a disease
Nah the game is still mid. It had bigger problems than bugs.
    mid=trash?
        Obviously you’ve never heard of hyperbole.
Neither of you are right.
    what then?
Nah take away the bugs, the game was still mid. The story was bland. That doesn’t mean it couldn’t be improved upon but it’s still unexpected taking something mid making it better.
Yea I'd be on board with that! Or possibly show the evolution and backstory of one of the random mooks our protagonists encountered and tangled with. The urinating Cyber-psychosis dude for instance, be weird to follow his origin story lol
    ahahaha that would be funny af. he had mil cyberware so who knows where he got it from
I can't help myself, it's just so good! It's almost like I'm hoping it will change or something, but I know it wont.
Same, I want to know what's going on with Lucy and Falco. It would be so cool if they somehow ended up back in the game or another story somewhere down the line. 

Hell, I'm more interested in this story than the regular game to be honest. Johnny was cool, but never felt like I cared for him, I want a crew like the show or beginning of the game.
i really wanna stay at your house ahahaha
How the turntables huh
    yep. usually with game-adapted anime we will get the usual low quality shows which always fail the source materials but this anime is a much better experience than what the game could offer.
Very rare that those things happen. The only other one I can recall is that the author of Fight Club the book thought that Fight Club the movie had a much stronger ending.
Stranger Things is popular and that had all the episodes released at once. More like anime community isn't the best place to discuss when we are going through a blitz of post. Also need to give people time to watch it. Not everyone likes to binge watch
    Stranger things initially premiered at a time when streaming services were just becoming dominant and "Netflix Original" still was a brand that was batting 1000. The idea of dropping a season all at once was still this novel thing and it happened in a much much less saturated market. Today, there are way more shows dropping seasons all at once (And then flipping a coin to see if they're cancelled). Unless you have already got an entrenched audience from the Before Times like Stranger things, it's harder to demand attention this way anymore.
I think the anime community is a bit too hype oriented. How do other fandoms operate around it? Video games don't have seasons, they all come out at once. So does a lot of other stuff. But discussions still happen weeks or even months after a game's release.

I think the real problem is the anime community as a whole and this sub have gotten a bit too dependent on the seasonal cycle of weekly discussion, and can't operate outside of hype and bandwagoning. By the time people have binged all the episodes of Edgerunner, the community would have already moved on to the next shiny season. It's kinda self limiting and people often forget about the stuff they were hyping just last season.
    Well, that's what happens when there's so *much* anime and so much of it is at least good (but so little is genuinely great).
    I think the biggest reason is that the majority of the anime community just moves on. There's always a new show to talk about instead.
    > Video games don't have seasons, they all come out at once. So does a lot of other stuff. But discussions still happen weeks or even months after a game's release.

Because there's more than a few hours of content in games usually.  If there isn't, then there is at least tactics and strategies, they have replay value, or the discussion just dies.

Also, games rarely come out all at once at this point.  They are either missing features that are added later or there is DLC that probably could've just been part of the original game.
        If anime is shorter than a video game, shouldn't that make it easier for people to discuss an anime that released all at once compared to a 50+ hour game? I don't really see the difference you're trying to point out. Months have passed and people are still finding new things in Elden Ring. Similarly, in manga communities like One Piece, Attack on Titan or Made in Abyss, people are discovering new things and discussing with the community everyday.

We don't have that in the anime community, everyone's attention span only works for 12 weeks at a time. Weekly discussions are so limiting, and if I try discussing something like Vinland Saga, people are gonna be like "are we still in 2019?"
            > Similarly, in manga communities like One Piece, Attack on Titan or Made in Abyss, people are discovering new things and discussing with the community everyday.

That's a bad example for your case. A lot of manga discussion runs around the fact that there's an ongoing cycle (weekly, monthly,...), there's a lot more One Piece discussion when there's a One Piece chapter. On the other hand, a finished manga like Monster will get mentioned about as much as its anime, once in a blue moon. 

Even AoT which still gets more discussion is mostly fuelled by the controversial ending, memes, and the upcoming final final final season.
                Fair point. But you're kind of dismissing the AoT discussion. Do you think r/anime is gonna talk about the controversial ending months after AoT wraps up, like the manga community did? Or do you think it'll be a 1 week controversy before everyone moves onto discussing the next season?
                    Hmm I don't think we'll see threads discussing it every week, but it's something that will sink into public awareness for sure and get brought up commonly.

I'd compare it to Wonder Egg Priority. It wasn't the most popular show, but its ending still left a strong lasting effect, that it gets brought up every once in a while. I imagine AoT will have something similar, on a much larger scale, I mean already it keeps getting brought up on r/anime by manga readers.
    Isn't it the lack of marketing for anime in the west?
    Having a pinned weekly discussion thread would go a long way. People talk about batch releases killing discussion, but I think far more of the problem is their discussion forums of choice. Or more accurately that they're not forums
    Meanwhile there's me who waits for entire cours to finish and then binges them in 3 days because I'm fuckin done with cliffhangers. I appreciate Netflix cutting out the middleman.
    I mean, it's a lot easier to discuss one thing at a time rather then 12, and there needs some time to digest and analyze everything you see.
        I see your point. But the same applies to video games. And even now, years later, I still see discussions and YouTube videos about games that came out long ago. Elden Ring came out months ago and people are still discovering and analyzing new things.

Meanwhile the anime community has a 12 week window of analysis, and after that they're already moving onto another show. For example, a show like Attack on Titan, there's just so much going on that you can't analyze that in one season. The manga community is always finding stuff that happened many chapters ago and connecting it with newer information.

Meanwhile the anime community just stops talking about it once the season ends, very few in the community dig deeper into shows long after they've finished airing. A show like Odd Taxi for example, gets better on rewatch after you know what happens in the last episode, but by that point people aren't around to discuss it anymore because the new season along with new hype trains have started.
    > Video games don't have seasons, they all come out at once. So does a lot of other stuff. But discussions still happen weeks or even months after a game's release.

Videogames are more hype based than any medium  and they discussion tends to die fairly quickly (ofc based on its length) for single player games that do not have DLC. Let's remember that the average for beating a videogame does not reach 30%.

And they do have seasons. Some are DLC for single player experiences, like cyberpunk recent boom caused by the dlc + sale of the base game, others are actually called season (gamepass included) for the game as a service trend for multiplayer games.
    >Video games don't have seasons

I mean actually a lot of the most popular video games **do** have seasons now.
    > Video games don't have seasons, they all come out at once.

*Destiny sweating profusely*
My theory is that the weekly release schedule vs batch release is actually the smaller issue, and the big problem with batch releases is that their release often doesn't align with the start of a new season.

Conventional wisdom would dictate that you should release your show when nothing else comes out. Anime is still strongly bound to seasons though, so fans will, unsurprisingly, look for new shows when there's actually new shows to watch.

Additionally, these shows also don't get featured in Anituber seasonal recommendations, since they're not out by the time the video is made, and too old when the new season rolls around.

ReLIFE for example was a batch release that aligned with the Summer 2016 season and didn't get overlooked.
Vampire in the garden was okay imo
Does the opposite for a lot of people, I for one hate watching weekly and can get a lot more hyped when I can watch something as fast or as slow as I want. Weeklies just annihilates any sense of pacing to me.
Honestly I think Edgerunners was better served by being released in a bingeable format. I think releasing weekly would have been a huge mistake with some of the big shows on the horizon. A lot of attention is going to be on stuff like Chainsaw Man and Spy X Family S2 soon.

Plus Edgerunners was really designed to be released in that format from the start and you can tell. If you were to watch it by just one episode a week it would start really, really slow and not be a good indicator of what the rest of the show is.
    Interesting opinion to be honest ,I believe that "longer exposure = more viewership " but I honestly never considered competition from heavy hitters ( this fall season is going to be bonkers)
        Mind you I think Cyberpunk is a unique scenario with it, because its a kind of sleeper hit. I dont think pre release anyone expected it to be as good as it is.

As a fan of not only the tabletop source material, cyberpunk 2020, and the game Cyberpunk 2077, and having watched several Trigger projects. I didnt even think it'd be this good.

So if it was drawn out over a weekly schedule over the course of 10 weeks and then had to go up against Spy x Family, Chainsaw Man, etc. I just dont think it would have grabbed the traction it currently has.
Well everyone outside of Japan should stop being snobs and play Dragon Quest then.
    I feel like every gamer should play at least one Dragon Quest game in thier lives, there's just something about it that hits different despite being so traditional.

Thankfully Dragon Quest 11 is on basically every platform now, with only the PS4 not having the definitive edition. 

Considering the games have changes platforms constantly, right now is arguably the easiest it has ever been to get into the series-esspecially since DQ11 is one of the best.
    [deleted]
        I respectfully disagree. Toriyama style also works well for Dragon Quest.
    For those that like jrpgs, sure. But that genre is niche so you can not expect all kind of players to try it.
What was the grand script? It was a fairly simple story.
No, the game has all new lore, and the anime uses that. The story itself was written by CDPR.

2020 called though, they want their hater bandwagon back.
    They scammed me as well as a lot of others I've got a right to be a hater I think
        > They scammed me

How did they scam you? I mean, you definitely waited until it released and reviews came out before buying, right? Certainly you didn't pre-pay for a product that doesn't exist solely on the faith that a company wouldn't fuck up, right?

They released a bad product, but they didn't scam you.
        You're one of those that dreamed up a perfect GTA clone and got mad when you didn't get it? Okay.
            Yeah that's right completely dismiss the valid reason I have to dislike the company. It was a shit show I'm glad they've not given up on it completely but when you scam your customers you reap what you sow
                You're free to dislike the game and the company. But most people calling them scammers are complaining about promises that were never made or features that were explicitly cut before release.
                    [deleted]
                        The game ran like shit on previous gen and deserves all the criticism, but the game itself was great on PC and next gen.

You're free to dislike the game, I don't really care about anyone's opinion tbh, what irks me is the fact that people like you keep bringing up promises that were never made, like GTA sandbox features, when the game is very obviously a story driven RPG.

You said It here, the features you "expected". Just because the game takes place in a city, doesn't mean It's meant to be a sandbox like GTA. People dreamed up a game and got mad when their fantasy didn't become reality.
            I love Cyberpunk but this isn’t a fair assessment, they quite clearly marketed it as a perfect GTA clone; I’m not gonna say that all the backlash that CDPR got was warranted but a good chunk of it definitely was
                No, it wasn't, at all. If you watched clickbait videos dreaming up the ultimate game, maybe. But this was always an RPG first, like the Witcher. This is what I'm talking about.

Edit: A guy commented and instantly blocked me about this. Holy shit, you people have some issues.
                    The RPG side of CP2077 is the worst aspect of it lmfao. 

You're dickriding way too much, I'm sorry your game failed and they had to spend 2 years making it decent. I'm sorry you're only getting 1 dlc before they jump ship to Witcher 4. I'm sorry you have to sit out here running defense for a company that will never care about you.
Feel like shit that I preordered a PS4 disk version...
Yes witcher 3 the wild hunt. The author only did the books
Check cdpr yt channel
I got goosebumps when he said "it's edgerunnin' time!"
    Best line was when he said he was built different
        Im glad im not the only one that that line stood out to
        The best part is I'm pretty sure several of these lines actually did get said and non of it made me roll my eyes.
        my friends all lost it at that line, had to pause our viewing party to laugh for a good minute
    That line was never actually said unlike the other two lines.  
The real line was "it's edgin' time"
They did a stream the day before release streaming the first 3 episodes and some discussion. Unfortunately the vod is gone now so you'll have to search if someone reuploaded it somewhere, I had a quick look and didn't find it but it's probably out there somewhere.
Reminds me how in the VN VA-11 Hall-A which also has a cyberpunk setting there's a character who's a sex worker android and she chose to stay with her younger body not getting an upgrade to appeal to that certain "market". It's weird but thinking about it of course there's be shit like this...
Then Woosh on me
    I don't want to whoosh on you. Only when the time.... Is right.
The separate subtitles for the Japanese dub still suck.
Lol you miss the point
The actors themselves are great, but so were the English VAs, and English felt more natural in night city.
I can literally speak fluent Japanese. English is the way to go here. The English cast is objectively better, and hearing them use similarish words in Japanese to what the real script obviously is (aka cyberpunk lingo) is just bad
    That's nice, but I've heard both, and the Japanese VA is strictly better imo. David especially, his English VA is flat as fuck. Rebecca is also 1000 times better jp
I thought it was well conveyed and I've never played the game. I got it the moment [Edgerunners spoilers]>!David's mom was processed and forgotten about like a used soda tin can!<
theyve buffed him up quite abit in the newest update
What's the point of armor in a show where characters can cleave through iron like it's paper.
It's incredibly underseen and more people need to watch it.
    What's about
Trigger also has script writing credit, so it's difficult to say who did what and how much
Yeah indeed.
What is dorohoro about
    It's... hard to explain but basically it's about this guy named Kaiman, an amnesic man disfigured by Magic who tries to recover both his original face and memories about his past.

And the adventures he encounters trying to reach that point.

According you
    According to me, anime community and definition of what "Anime" is. Go check any Anime DB and see what entries they have registered, you won't find these but cyberpunk is there coz Trigger a jp studio produced it.
        >According to me

Worthless 

>anime community and definition of what "Anime" is.

There is no consensus, stupid .

>Go check any Anime DB and see what entries they have registered,

I won't,  that shit ain't an anime authority. 

Don't reply kid , I could only care for your opinion if I were getting paid to hear it .
            You're just a dumbass baboon with 2 braincells
    Hell even just check this place r/anime, there are no discussion threads or anything, that should tell your dumb brain something.
Okay now I finished the show and I just dont know what to say. In my opinion the show is really well made and definitly worth a watch. The Animation, the soundtrack and the characters are just perfect. And I really agree with OP, now I’m feeling empty
    welcome to the club homie ;(
mate watch it, it is top class and am jealous you are getting to watch it for the first time :(
I'm both an anime and a cyberpunk fan. I'd say edgerunners is better than ghost in the shell 2045.
    That’s not a high bar tho.
        Hey there's not much cyberpunk genre. I'll take what I can get. At long as it entertains me I'm happy. No need to set high bars for my entertainment.
bout to
    Has every opportunity to be shit and every opportunity to be one of the best anime in recent history, so let's wait before we keep building up expectations.
        if mappa screw this up somehow they're basically dead so i wouldn't worry too much
            Lol business doesn't work like that
I saw a rumor (so take with a grain of salt) that the official subs are just the script for the dub, which is why they don't make a whole lot of sense.
    Well...as the poster above you outlined, the dub was completely different than the subtitles portrayed. Things almost never lined up. So things would have had to change a LOT for the dub from scripting phase, more than usual.
Edgerunners wasn't all that much either tbh, for me it lacked a good villain/antagonist, and the plot was a bit predictable, still pretty fun though.
Story wise it might fall a tad short of cyberpunk but the animation they showed off for the trailer definitely should make you hold off judgement till afterwards.
    Fair enough
I'd throw Summer Time Render, MiA and maybe SxF above Cyberpunk, but not Kaguya, Lyco Reco and certainly not CotE2. 

But that's what great about anime, everybody has their own opinion and that's ay okay. Also just goes to show how absolutely stacked this year has been.
    I thought everyone loved Kaguya-sama season 3, damn that's a surprise. SxF isn't really a contender for me tbh. We still got Mob Psycho, Chainsaw Man, and Golden Kamuy (actually the only one that I think might top Cyberpunk at this point) for fall.
        I didn't dislike Kaguya, I thought it was really good. I just preferred the other shows I mentioned. 

I've given MiA, Kaguya, SxF, STR and Cyberpunk all 9s on MAL actually.
            I'm not knocking on the ranking going on in this thread, but I don't know if it's fair to rank the anime like that as they all have different styles, different genres. For instance Spy Family vs Cyberpunk. How is a fair comparison to be made.... It's hard. Like asking whether Aliens is a better movie than Titanic...
                Yeah for sure, comparing apples to oranges. I just try to rank it in terms of overall enjoyment. Like "that was one of the tastiest apples or juiciest steaks" like Cyberpunk was a fantastic sci-fi, but comparing it to SxF doesn't really make sense unless you rank it by overall enjoyment in comparison with others in its genre.
                    Yes agree with you. But it ranks up up there for sure. I'd been slightly disappointed this summer anime... Until now! Holy shit this anime is good.
        Oh, and there's also Bleach and a re-airing of the (decent) Berserk movies in an episodic format with added and polished scenes. Great time to be an anime fan.
Genuine question what exactly are you saying is better about cyberpunk compared to those shows? I get animation and entertainment but I can’t imagine you’re talking about the story or characters.
I was being a little hyperbolic, but honestly, now that I'm sitting down and thinking about it... there's like, only a *scattered few* things post-2000 that I'd say are better than this. FLCL, Spirited Away, Mushishi, Samurai Champloo, and Kemonozume are about it, and I would honestly go "yeah, fair" at anyone who put Edgerunners above those.

Edgerunners isn't just good, it's one of the fucking all-time GOATs.
    Again, Idk about that bud
    Watch more lmao.

Madoka Magica, Steins;Gate, Shinsekai Yori are better just off the top of my head.
        Madoka and Shinsekai Yori are up there in the same zone too, yeah, I just forgot about them.

Steins;Gate is good, but not GOAT candidate good, I feel like.
            I feel the exact opposite. Madoka was great, but not better than Steins Gate. And Shinsekai Yori was decent but the pacing was messy.
Yep. CDPR also added some Edgerunners easter eggs in the game in the recent patch so it's 100% canon.
Not equally though. There's a lot of important characters/locations from the game that show up very briefly in the anime. You wouldn't remember them when playing the game if you watched the anime first, but you would notice them in the anime if you played the game first. 

Like Rogue shows up for 2 seconds in the anime, purely there as an easter egg for people who played the game.
"Another turn for the next dreamer."
Some people in the game found a way to co-exist with the city, like Doc Viktor or Misty or River ward, laying low, taking care family, not aiming high...or some people just simply leave night city and become a nomad. Not exactly the happy ending we have in mind, but i guess it's the closest thing to it people could have in that kind of world.
    Yeah, but why not a story where someone aims high and succeeds? That could be cool too.
        Yeah, its called going corpo, lmao
        I'm down with that. Nothing's wrong with seeing a choom beating the odds and rise up in NC for once.
It's kind of hard the setting does have some happy endings but they aren't *cyberpunk* in theme, people stuck in places like night city are kind of stuck..

For example:  There's the Highriders federation which is Africa+Space colonies and it's kind of a utopia, they don't havea horrid problems with poverty/corrupt megacorps, they don't have to deal with the nuclear/climate hellhole much of earth has to, and some of their tech is decades ahead.  They aren't even **Cyberpunk** they use Bioware which are genetically engineer super organs instead of metal cyberware and they don't have cyber-psychosis.  

In a way the future of space colonization and Africa is extremely optimistic and hopeful, just Night City, the Americas'  and most of EU, Asia, and the rest of the world are stuck on earth living in a sort of post apocalyptic society after the nukes/WMD's of the 2020's.
I agree that the pacing fits and is part of it, but you don't need the same pacing for the entire show. Add a few more somber and slow-paced episodes with character development in between and it would make every character death and decision more impactful and therefor create an overall better show.

Edgerunner lacks those extra episodes but for the runtime that it has it is still amazing. The vast majority of studios would have a really hard time creating a similarly touching story in that little screentime.
Well then, I think the whole genre of cyberpunk isn't really your thing. Cyberpunk is essentially that humans are oppressed by corporations, governments and each other, and there is a powerful class while most others live barely above poverty.  As a main character in a cyberpunk setting you will try to rise above the mud but are almost always pushed back and lose in the end.  
  
The whole genre of cyberpunk fiction is like that.
    I dunno, Dimension W and Ergo Proxy were both amazing, dark in atmosphere while being overall fun and interesting. VA-11 HALL-A is also one of my favorite games every, and has a definitively lighthearted tone, if a little melancholic. Hell, even Alita: Battle Angel had distinct elements of optimism.
>	As a main character in a cyberpunk setting you will try to rise above the mud but are almost always pushed back and lose in the end.

This sounds like a defining element of [grimdark](https://youtu.be/PQAWBeFnkg8?t=5m25s) rather than cyberpunk. Not that that’s what Edgerunners is, but it seems like it’s got elements of it here and there from what I’ve heard.
This is one of the most 2D shows you will see this year, not just this season. Only some objects and some vehicles are 3D, and half of those you probably won't even notice are 3D because of how well they are placed in the scene.
That is not even 10%, and the way they animated the vehicles unless they spin it's very hard to notice they are 3D... talk about a blatant lie. And the only backgrounds that were 3D was when a camera was moving through said background, like every time they were showing the Arasaka tower with the camera above the whole thing. Because of the way the camera moves of course you had to do those elements in 3D. But every other background that wasn't Arasaka tower, was almost always 2D, which is a rare feat today.

And if you want to call it CG  write 3DCG, as CG means Computer Generated (CGI is Computer Generated Image) and absolutely every modern anime is ALL CG, since at the end of the day all colorind and putting all the visual elements together (and so much more) is done on a computer, thus making what comes out CG.
They also had a bunch of guns, especially when they were in your face, in 3D, but you only noticed that by paying very close attention (and you need a trained eye for that). The 3D vehicles at the very end were indeed the most noticeable, but that was probably more to do with the whole construction of the scene and how extensive they were used, because in previous scenes despite using the same tech, the 3D was not easy to spot. I think what go to you was the animation, in previous scenes vehicles were animated differently, as if they were 2D assets, while the animation for the car chase at the end was a lot smoother, and thus made the 3DCG more obvious.

Honestly it could have just as well been a situation where for the amount of vehicles they had in those scenes, there just wasn't enough time to individually key frame animate the cars, like they had done previously.
Netflix and only Netflix
    Thanks!
Have you actually watched any that aren't considered bad?
    What would you recommend?
        Houseki no Kuni and Beastars are definitely high quality CGI. I'd check one of those out.
            Don't forget Dorohedoro
                Framerate is a little choppy for something I would wanna use to convince someone that CGI can look good.
Gatekeeping is a disease
mid=trash?
    Obviously you’ve never heard of hyperbole.
what then?
ahahaha that would be funny af. he had mil cyberware so who knows where he got it from
yep. usually with game-adapted anime we will get the usual low quality shows which always fail the source materials but this anime is a much better experience than what the game could offer.
Stranger things initially premiered at a time when streaming services were just becoming dominant and "Netflix Original" still was a brand that was batting 1000. The idea of dropping a season all at once was still this novel thing and it happened in a much much less saturated market. Today, there are way more shows dropping seasons all at once (And then flipping a coin to see if they're cancelled). Unless you have already got an entrenched audience from the Before Times like Stranger things, it's harder to demand attention this way anymore.
Well, that's what happens when there's so *much* anime and so much of it is at least good (but so little is genuinely great).
I think the biggest reason is that the majority of the anime community just moves on. There's always a new show to talk about instead.
> Video games don't have seasons, they all come out at once. So does a lot of other stuff. But discussions still happen weeks or even months after a game's release.

Because there's more than a few hours of content in games usually.  If there isn't, then there is at least tactics and strategies, they have replay value, or the discussion just dies.

Also, games rarely come out all at once at this point.  They are either missing features that are added later or there is DLC that probably could've just been part of the original game.
    If anime is shorter than a video game, shouldn't that make it easier for people to discuss an anime that released all at once compared to a 50+ hour game? I don't really see the difference you're trying to point out. Months have passed and people are still finding new things in Elden Ring. Similarly, in manga communities like One Piece, Attack on Titan or Made in Abyss, people are discovering new things and discussing with the community everyday.

We don't have that in the anime community, everyone's attention span only works for 12 weeks at a time. Weekly discussions are so limiting, and if I try discussing something like Vinland Saga, people are gonna be like "are we still in 2019?"
        > Similarly, in manga communities like One Piece, Attack on Titan or Made in Abyss, people are discovering new things and discussing with the community everyday.

That's a bad example for your case. A lot of manga discussion runs around the fact that there's an ongoing cycle (weekly, monthly,...), there's a lot more One Piece discussion when there's a One Piece chapter. On the other hand, a finished manga like Monster will get mentioned about as much as its anime, once in a blue moon. 

Even AoT which still gets more discussion is mostly fuelled by the controversial ending, memes, and the upcoming final final final season.
            Fair point. But you're kind of dismissing the AoT discussion. Do you think r/anime is gonna talk about the controversial ending months after AoT wraps up, like the manga community did? Or do you think it'll be a 1 week controversy before everyone moves onto discussing the next season?
                Hmm I don't think we'll see threads discussing it every week, but it's something that will sink into public awareness for sure and get brought up commonly.

I'd compare it to Wonder Egg Priority. It wasn't the most popular show, but its ending still left a strong lasting effect, that it gets brought up every once in a while. I imagine AoT will have something similar, on a much larger scale, I mean already it keeps getting brought up on r/anime by manga readers.
Isn't it the lack of marketing for anime in the west?
Having a pinned weekly discussion thread would go a long way. People talk about batch releases killing discussion, but I think far more of the problem is their discussion forums of choice. Or more accurately that they're not forums
Meanwhile there's me who waits for entire cours to finish and then binges them in 3 days because I'm fuckin done with cliffhangers. I appreciate Netflix cutting out the middleman.
I mean, it's a lot easier to discuss one thing at a time rather then 12, and there needs some time to digest and analyze everything you see.
    I see your point. But the same applies to video games. And even now, years later, I still see discussions and YouTube videos about games that came out long ago. Elden Ring came out months ago and people are still discovering and analyzing new things.

Meanwhile the anime community has a 12 week window of analysis, and after that they're already moving onto another show. For example, a show like Attack on Titan, there's just so much going on that you can't analyze that in one season. The manga community is always finding stuff that happened many chapters ago and connecting it with newer information.

Meanwhile the anime community just stops talking about it once the season ends, very few in the community dig deeper into shows long after they've finished airing. A show like Odd Taxi for example, gets better on rewatch after you know what happens in the last episode, but by that point people aren't around to discuss it anymore because the new season along with new hype trains have started.
> Video games don't have seasons, they all come out at once. So does a lot of other stuff. But discussions still happen weeks or even months after a game's release.

Videogames are more hype based than any medium  and they discussion tends to die fairly quickly (ofc based on its length) for single player games that do not have DLC. Let's remember that the average for beating a videogame does not reach 30%.

And they do have seasons. Some are DLC for single player experiences, like cyberpunk recent boom caused by the dlc + sale of the base game, others are actually called season (gamepass included) for the game as a service trend for multiplayer games.
>Video games don't have seasons

I mean actually a lot of the most popular video games **do** have seasons now.
> Video games don't have seasons, they all come out at once.

*Destiny sweating profusely*
Interesting opinion to be honest ,I believe that "longer exposure = more viewership " but I honestly never considered competition from heavy hitters ( this fall season is going to be bonkers)
    Mind you I think Cyberpunk is a unique scenario with it, because its a kind of sleeper hit. I dont think pre release anyone expected it to be as good as it is.

As a fan of not only the tabletop source material, cyberpunk 2020, and the game Cyberpunk 2077, and having watched several Trigger projects. I didnt even think it'd be this good.

So if it was drawn out over a weekly schedule over the course of 10 weeks and then had to go up against Spy x Family, Chainsaw Man, etc. I just dont think it would have grabbed the traction it currently has.
I feel like every gamer should play at least one Dragon Quest game in thier lives, there's just something about it that hits different despite being so traditional.

Thankfully Dragon Quest 11 is on basically every platform now, with only the PS4 not having the definitive edition. 

Considering the games have changes platforms constantly, right now is arguably the easiest it has ever been to get into the series-esspecially since DQ11 is one of the best.
[deleted]
    I respectfully disagree. Toriyama style also works well for Dragon Quest.
For those that like jrpgs, sure. But that genre is niche so you can not expect all kind of players to try it.
They scammed me as well as a lot of others I've got a right to be a hater I think
    > They scammed me

How did they scam you? I mean, you definitely waited until it released and reviews came out before buying, right? Certainly you didn't pre-pay for a product that doesn't exist solely on the faith that a company wouldn't fuck up, right?

They released a bad product, but they didn't scam you.
    You're one of those that dreamed up a perfect GTA clone and got mad when you didn't get it? Okay.
        Yeah that's right completely dismiss the valid reason I have to dislike the company. It was a shit show I'm glad they've not given up on it completely but when you scam your customers you reap what you sow
            You're free to dislike the game and the company. But most people calling them scammers are complaining about promises that were never made or features that were explicitly cut before release.

Similarly, in manga communities like One Piece, Attack on Titan or Made in Abyss, people are discovering new things and discussing with the community everyday.

We don't have that in the anime community, everyone's attention span only works for 12 weeks at a time. Weekly discussions are so limiting, and if I try discussing something like Vinland Saga, people are gonna be like "are we still in 2019?"
    > Similarly, in manga communities like One Piece, Attack on Titan or Made in Abyss, people are discovering new things and discussing with the community everyday.

That's a bad example for your case. A lot of manga discussion runs around the fact that there's an ongoing cycle (weekly, monthly,...), there's a lot more One Piece discussion when there's a One Piece chapter. On the other hand, a finished manga like Monster will get mentioned about as much as its anime, once in a blue moon. 

Even AoT which still gets more discussion is mostly fuelled by the controversial ending, memes, and the upcoming final final final season.
        Fair point. But you're kind of dismissing the AoT discussion. Do you think r/anime is gonna talk about the controversial ending months after AoT wraps up, like the manga community did? Or do you think it'll be a 1 week controversy before everyone moves onto discussing the next season?
            Hmm I don't think we'll see threads discussing it every week, but it's something that will sink into public awareness for sure and get brought up commonly.

I'd compare it to Wonder Egg Priority. It wasn't the most popular show, but its ending still left a strong lasting effect, that it gets brought up every once in a while. I imagine AoT will have something similar, on a much larger scale, I mean already it keeps getting brought up on r/anime by manga readers.
I see your point. But the same applies to video games. And even now, years later, I still see discussions and YouTube videos about games that came out long ago. Elden Ring came out months ago and people are still discovering and analyzing new things.

Meanwhile the anime community has a 12 week window of analysis, and after that they're already moving onto another show. For example, a show like Attack on Titan, there's just so much going on that you can't analyze that in one season. The manga community is always finding stuff that happened many chapters ago and connecting it with newer information.

Meanwhile the anime community just stops talking about it once the season ends, very few in the community dig deeper into shows long after they've finished airing. A show like Odd Taxi for example, gets better on rewatch after you know what happens in the last episode, but by that point people aren't around to discuss it anymore because the new season along with new hype trains have started.
Mind you I think Cyberpunk is a unique scenario with it, because its a kind of sleeper hit. I dont think pre release anyone expected it to be as good as it is.

As a fan of not only the tabletop source material, cyberpunk 2020, and the game Cyberpunk 2077, and having watched several Trigger projects. I didnt even think it'd be this good.

So if it was drawn out over a weekly schedule over the course of 10 weeks and then had to go up against Spy x Family, Chainsaw Man, etc. I just dont think it would have grabbed the traction it currently has.
I respectfully disagree. Toriyama style also works well for Dragon Quest.
> They scammed me

How did they scam you? I mean, you definitely waited until it released and reviews came out before buying, right? Certainly you didn't pre-pay for a product that doesn't exist solely on the faith that a company wouldn't fuck up, right?

They released a bad product, but they didn't scam you.
You're one of those that dreamed up a perfect GTA clone and got mad when you didn't get it? Okay.
    Yeah that's right completely dismiss the valid reason I have to dislike the company. It was a shit show I'm glad they've not given up on it completely but when you scam your customers you reap what you sow
        You're free to dislike the game and the company. But most people calling them scammers are complaining about promises that were never made or features that were explicitly cut before release.

                The game ran like shit on previous gen and deserves all the criticism, but the game itself was great on PC and next gen.

You're free to dislike the game, I don't really care about anyone's opinion tbh, what irks me is the fact that people like you keep bringing up promises that were never made, like GTA sandbox features, when the game is very obviously a story driven RPG.

You said It here, the features you "expected". Just because the game takes place in a city, doesn't mean It's meant to be a sandbox like GTA. People dreamed up a game and got mad when their fantasy didn't become reality.
    I love Cyberpunk but this isn’t a fair assessment, they quite clearly marketed it as a perfect GTA clone; I’m not gonna say that all the backlash that CDPR got was warranted but a good chunk of it definitely was
        No, it wasn't, at all. If you watched clickbait videos dreaming up the ultimate game, maybe. But this was always an RPG first, like the Witcher. This is what I'm talking about.

Edit: A guy commented and instantly blocked me about this. Holy shit, you people have some issues.
            The RPG side of CP2077 is the worst aspect of it lmfao. 

You're dickriding way too much, I'm sorry your game failed and they had to spend 2 years making it decent. I'm sorry you're only getting 1 dlc before they jump ship to Witcher 4. I'm sorry you have to sit out here running defense for a company that will never care about you.
Im glad im not the only one that that line stood out to
The best part is I'm pretty sure several of these lines actually did get said and non of it made me roll my eyes.
my friends all lost it at that line, had to pause our viewing party to laugh for a good minute
>According to me

Worthless 

>anime community and definition of what "Anime" is.

There is no consensus, stupid .

>Go check any Anime DB and see what entries they have registered,

I won't,  that shit ain't an anime authority. 

Don't reply kid , I could only care for your opinion if I were getting paid to hear it .
    You're just a dumbass baboon with 2 braincells
Hey there's not much cyberpunk genre. I'll take what I can get. At long as it entertains me I'm happy. No need to set high bars for my entertainment.
if mappa screw this up somehow they're basically dead so i wouldn't worry too much
    Lol business doesn't work like that
I didn't dislike Kaguya, I thought it was really good. I just preferred the other shows I mentioned. 

I've given MiA, Kaguya, SxF, STR and Cyberpunk all 9s on MAL actually.
    I'm not knocking on the ranking going on in this thread, but I don't know if it's fair to rank the anime like that as they all have different styles, different genres. For instance Spy Family vs Cyberpunk. How is a fair comparison to be made.... It's hard. Like asking whether Aliens is a better movie than Titanic...
        Yeah for sure, comparing apples to oranges. I just try to rank it in terms of overall enjoyment. Like "that was one of the tastiest apples or juiciest steaks" like Cyberpunk was a fantastic sci-fi, but comparing it to SxF doesn't really make sense unless you rank it by overall enjoyment in comparison with others in its genre.
            Yes agree with you. But it ranks up up there for sure. I'd been slightly disappointed this summer anime... Until now! Holy shit this anime is good.
Oh, and there's also Bleach and a re-airing of the (decent) Berserk movies in an episodic format with added and polished scenes. Great time to be an anime fan.
Madoka and Shinsekai Yori are up there in the same zone too, yeah, I just forgot about them.

Steins;Gate is good, but not GOAT candidate good, I feel like.
    I feel the exact opposite. Madoka was great, but not better than Steins Gate. And Shinsekai Yori was decent but the pacing was messy.
Yeah, its called going corpo, lmao
I'm down with that. Nothing's wrong with seeing a choom beating the odds and rise up in NC for once.
Houseki no Kuni and Beastars are definitely high quality CGI. I'd check one of those out.
    Don't forget Dorohedoro
        Framerate is a little choppy for something I would wanna use to convince someone that CGI can look good.
