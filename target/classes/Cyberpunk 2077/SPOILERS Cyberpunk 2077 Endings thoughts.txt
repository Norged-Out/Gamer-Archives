[[SPOILERS Cyberpunk 2077 Endings thoughts]]


Anyone else feel like there wasn't really a happy ending? The endings left me feeling a bit empty, closest thing is the Paman one and even then still feels a bit sad. Thoughts???


For me the Panam one gives me hope, and allows me to use my imagination, that when I drop back into the game world, I succeeded in finding a way to survive.
    Thats a good way toi think about it, maybe down the line they will do a DLC following on from the ending. I doubt it but would be cool
        I think they probably will create a DLC to explore this ending. Seeing as the other endings did not really have a way to continue on without massive changes other than the ending in which Johnny Silverhand keeps the body. Since keeping Keanu Reeves on a payroll would probably leave them broke pretty fast, I don't think they'll go down that route. CDPR really spent a lot on this game, I think they'll want to keep the main character alive, despite him not being as iconic as, say, Geralt or Shepard.

Edit: Plus the Panam ending just feels more polished and more thought through as if somebody put more effort into it. Can't hide bias, whatever will later be used should logically get more attention. My gut is almost never wrong about these.
            > Plus the Panam ending just feels more polished and more thought through

Which is weird considering triggering it is kinda random in a way as a StreetKid. Johnny and Rogue are part of your path more frequently and more organically than Panam, who you only meet once and never again (unless you go out of your way to do her side quests)... 

However, Panam offers a more satisfying ending. Before tonight I was set at going the Rogue/Johnny way, but now that I know about how open and optimistic Panam’s ending are, I’ll just change route and call the Nomads. Still feel weird and unnatural, but at least I will get something somewhat satisfying out of it.
                > (unless you go out of your way to do her side quests)...

If you don't - you should not get the option of this ending, that would make no sense.
                    I mean, I get that, but my point is that in order to get a somewhat hopeful ending you have to abandon the main organic narrative and do *her* sidequest, despite the fact you barely hear/see her again after her branch in the main story.
                        All the "character-arc" sidequests are like that. For Judy, River, Panam.. hell, even the one for Johnny. Or the one for Jackie's funeral.  It is a question of friendship - if you consider that character someone worthwhile, a friend - you take time to do them. For me it was pretty organic, especially considering Panam as romance option.
                        That’s one way to view it. But you could also say that Johnny and Rogue represent the trap of Night City, they’re legends in their own right and you can become one too... but look at the cost they paid. And Jackie paid. And every street kid pays pursuing that goal. 

Choosing the Nomads IS a bit random, because it’s you breaking that cycle. Potentially for the better.
                Very late to the party, but to me I thought the most thematically appropriate ending was Johnny leading a new raid of Arisaka tower, only this time he's not doing it to destroy or to fulfill some ill-defined grab for glory, but to save V (and for my headcanon nomad V, it was also appropriate that possibly their final act would be to put their complete faith in another to save their life). And I thought that mission was awesome! Looking forward to replaying the game with Male V so I can romance Panam and get my "happy" ending, if we want to call it that.
                    I understand what you're saying but i disagree with your assetment of the game's theme. This wasnt Johnny's story, it was V's. Leaving the soul sucking corporate Night City for the road with Panam feels more like canon.
                        Depends on how you view the story - Is it a redemption arc in which V learns it's not about where you end up, but the people you love (Nomad ending)? Or is it a rags to riches story where V finally, and at a great cost, becomes the greatest merc in all of night city?
                            Yeah, it depends. The rags to riches is pushed heavily. The whole reason was to become the king of Night City. 

After it sucks you up and spits you out though, I like the redemption/nomad arc.
                                
Interesting - I tried both endings as of yesterday and I strongly feel the rags to riches ending felt better. I barely wanted to finish the nomad ending for my street kid V who wanted to be a legend. I think it purely depends on what WE want for our Vs!
                        We are in agreement, I was referring specifically to the quest itself.
                You can totally make it work for a streetkid I think, it's what I did and I just saw it as my V was sick of the city and the pain it's brought and was enjoying living the nomad life on his jobs with Panam so decided fuck it, nomad life let's go
                    Makes sense cuz in the beginning the street kid went to Atlanta hoping it was better than NC. After being burned by the city life, it’d make sense to go nomad.
                wanna give my opinion on your post to just make you feel a bit more comfortable with choosing panam... If we take references from films and series, 

altered carbon takeshi started somewhat "corpo" being in the army and ended up with a group of rebels.

oblivion, jack harper started from "corpo" but ended up rebel.

Luke skywalker, scrapper/tinkerer.

Elisium almost has that same ending feel where they gang up to take down the big shots.

some more but I dont wanna think anymore and you get  the idea. Nomads are the nearest we can get to rebels in the game (with the exception of silverhand and his chooms. that was 50 years ago)
            [deleted]
                I don't think Kerry gets ghosted? If you are in a relationship with Kerry and choose the nomad ending, Kerry shows up to the camp in a taxi shortly before you leave and breaks up with you. Now that was a gut punch for me. All those people you got killed by asking the nomads for help, and your boyfriend doesn't even leave with you.
                    Kerry has a real life and a career outside of you. River has his family. It makes sense that neither of them drop their whole everything to come on your escape, just like it makes sense for Judy to quit Night City and leave with you.

I don't see how it's a stab at the Aldecaldos that neither Kerry or River come with you; they're not the nomad's family. You are.
                        Never said it was a stab at the Aldecaldos, I said it was a gut punch to me, because I'd grown to like Kerry and his relationship with V during my playthrough, I was sad that I had to leave him behind.
                        Which is why the female V with Judy in the Panam ending is the best to me - it gets the most good people out of NC and happy.
                    I'm so pissed about this ending. It doesn't feel like the good ending everyone said it was. Your boyfriend leaves you and you get a bunch of good people killed, all so you can live 6 months more. Honestly wtf? I was somehow happy with the game despite the bugs but this has left a bad taste in my mouth I can't shake. I even felt a strong emotional/ friendship connection to Panam, but still. Ugh.

Edit: extra words
            Could as easily explore the arasaka ending though. The one where you can sign a contract. Maybe they find a way to give v a new body. Seeing as this is one of the default endings it's way more likely to be explored in the future.
                There would be no Johnny Silverhand then, which would be a bummer. The main character, V, was not really that Iconic or memorable. Johnny Silverhand compensated for that. Without Silverhand, I think the game would lose its cool factor. That's why I initially thought Arasaka ending would not be explored. Also, whether you choose Mikoshi or Earth is important. They cant possibly explore both, it's vastly different. Nomad ending only has one option and that is to leave Night City. If you give the body to Johnny, he also leaves Night City, which, in my mind, indicates that they want to explore other cities or states maybe due to the creative freedom it will provide. Night City is well-defined but other cities or states are less so.
            What about blue eyes man? That ending has too many unknowns and sometimes frightens me. I doubt V is alone to kill all the corpo owners and rich people.
        I just enjoy cruising through Night City, collecting things, doing random events that seem to infinitely pop up from time to time, I am basically living in Night City.
            Lmao tell me about it, have so much fun just roaming around, running off a laptop with a 2080 maxq atm so can't wait for my pc parts to play it at a decent frame rate, what are you rocking hardware wise?
                Love to see that people are actually enjoying the story and this game. This sub feels so toxic to be on. Feels like there is no place to be enthausiastic about this game. This game really gripped me for it's storytelling and people you meet, but so many people wanted so much different things from this game. Everyone had their idea of cyberpunk in their head before the game launched, but there is only one version of it. Without bugs and some fixing of AI perhaps this game should be ready for a lot of good story DLC. Hope to see the pan am ending expanded as she is one of the characters and stories I ended up caring for the most. Best written of the characters and side quests IMO. Was really happy to find out there was a somewhat happy ending for her.

                        Hey, I noticed you're account is kind of new, just so you know, you don't need to put a sub's URL to link to it, just r/ and the subs name works, in your case r/lowsodiumcyberpunk
    I also really loved it. Especially during credits when Misty mentioned that she did tarot and that V's got a great life ahead. This girl definitely knows more than we do... :)
        Can I just say I love Misty, like not in a romantic way, as she was with Jackie, but like a great woman who would give you a hug if you needed one in a hard time, she really is so sweet, and pure.
            Totally agree with you, she's always there to comfort and support you. Great character.
            Totally misty reminds me of Mayuri from steins gate tbh
        That part was the icing on the cake for that ending. I tried the Rogue ending before I went with Panam, because I was scared of her dying, but the ending choices for that one made me so mad I almost decided to stop playing for good. I went back and did the one with her and I'm loving the game again
 🔥
            Yeah I felt a similar way going with the rogue one, I didn't go with Panam because I felt like I didn't want to risk her life, or the nomads. I might do that my next PT because I'm mad that I also left Takemura behind, and I didn't know you could go back for him. The guy was one of my favorite characters too. 

I also don't mind sad endings, I mean I loved RDR2's, its a gem. But what i got felt like there was no resolution, and in fact my character's life worsened in quality with River.
                Little late but 100% agreed. I legit didn't know you could go back for Takemura. An optional objective didn't show up so I thought he was gone. Only found out a little bit later after looking up some of the missions online. Really made me sad since, like you said, he was one of my favorites too. If there's at least one thing CDPR did right, it's the fuckin characters. I honestly think I can say I like pretty much every single one of them.
                    the characters were nice. I think River needed more to his questlines, but hes still likeable. I didn't think I'd like everyone as much as I did, so I agree. The story line itself is good too. Only wished for some finer details in some areas, but hopefully if they do a dlc it will expand on the characters we got attached to.
                        Yeah River was my first romance of the bunch, figured I'd do separate playthroughs with the others later. He's honestly pretty cool, and I'd argue his side job quest line was both quite disturbing and also very well done. Probably one of my favorites. Panam's questline was definitely quite fun too, and the first time I got to test run the Basilisk, I got pretty hype lol. Sadly, I didn't finish up all of Judy's before I beat the game, but I'll probably just go back before the endgame sequence and wait out a day to finish. She seems pretty cool too.

That's definitely something I hope they do as well: flesh out the romance options/characters more. Gonna be a while before we get DLC though, I imagine. I'm okay with that.
                            I thought there'd be a little more to River's questlines, they were well done. I agree, but by doing two things with him he calls about missing V, which i don't think is fully justified since they barely know eachother, where as Panam and Judy do have longer sequences before the romance scenes. I do like the dynamic between the cop angle and a law breaking merc. I wish they played with that a little more. 

It would be cool to have new romances as well, given i guess some can break it off with you depending on what ending you go with. It'll be interesting how they tie everything together.
                    I did the Panam ending and on the end credit scene, Takemura San told me to go to hell. I saved him and all. Anyone got this too?
            Do sad endings make you not like the story?
                Garbage endings make me not like the story. 🤷‍♂️  Especially in games where post story dlc could be easily doable.  Fallout 3 was probably the only game that fixed their ending with dlc.
                    Sad endings aren't necessarily garbage though. The first ending I tried was the suicide one and... it's probably the worst but it was quite powerful and well made. Its message might seem quite obvious but it's one that is always good to remember: suicide is not difficult for the one committing it... it's hard for the ones left behind and that have to keep on living (which is paradoxical because V choses this end because it's the "least bloody"... except he/she didn't factor in the pain and despair).
    I really hope the Panam ending is canon. I hope when they go to Arizona it starts off in a new game, not a DLC. I, hoping that V gets a cure and can live out his life, to me Panam is such a great character and i would love to see something continued off Panam and V where V gets a cure and lives happily ever after with Panam and his Nomad friends.
        I played through all of the endings, and the one with Panam was by far the best, and the one that just feels right with the story. Going off of Mistys card readings in the credits I feel like it will work out for V.
            I played through all the endings too, i noticed that when Misty was reading the cards to you, the only good one was with Panam and every other ending besides Panam's was a bad card reading. I think Panam's ending is canon, just feels like they've done more work into her ending then another. I really hope that Panam's ending is canon.
                I feel the same. It definitely should be the canon ending considering the others were just hollow in comparison.
                    Yeah all the other endings just felt depressing, but Panam's ending actually felt good, it gave me hope about V's survival. But yeah again i really hope this ending is canon
                Panam's ending is the only one that has V taking full control of herself and her destiny. In the other endings, she hands over control to someone else, be it Johnny or Arasaka. In that way, the game's theme is for self-actualisation, as V is only rewarded for bringing herself out of the mess she's in.
                    not necessarily. [you missed an ending.](https://youtu.be/UIi-Ufnvkg0?t=144) :)

spoilers, obviously. >!this ending is insanely difficult. i came in with my overpowered build at level 44 doing 10,000+ damage per bullet with a smart SMG and had to crank the difficulty down to easy to pull it off. the enemies are bullet sponges who will 1-2 shot you depending on build and if you die during it, counts as the suicide ending and rolls credits, meaning you have to give up or redo the whole ending sequence up to that point. balls hard challenge run.!<
                She gives you a good reading on the Path of Glory ending too, at least if you do the solo mission. I still liked Panam's ending better though.
                I think all the endings suck in some way still. If you go with Panam then Johnny ends up merging with Alt.
        its also the only ending you can actually stay with Judy if you romance her. Otherwise, she'll just put an end to your relationship
        I did the don't fear the reaper ending and find it so silly that V can't leave the city after the solo raid on Mikoshi. Panam wouldn't be so busy that she has to keep blowing off your plans if Saul was still alive.
        I agree with the overall impression but is the Panam romance available to non-male characters? Can hardly be canon otherwise. I wouldn't even be certain CDPR ever says which one is canon, as a matter of fact.
            You don't need to romance her for the ending.  As female V my lovely Judy left with us.
                Ah, that's great, thanks for clearing that up.
                Really cool. As male V romancing Panam and  being friend with Judy, she sends a message and it's obvious she's on the road (outdoors, maybe by a camp fire) and says that leaving NC is the best choice.
            Can only romance Panam if your a male. The ending for Panam just feels more thought of or something like they put more time into the ending. Hope it's canon man
        I think that the panam ending is actually the Canon one. More. Like it at least because u have time left. To find a cure and I think it's the only ending that could possibly have a nice dlc for it To continue. All the other endings are just kinda sad and done for so I think the panam one is the most Canon likely.
    What I was hoping was maybe they do what happens at the end of the fallout 3 where they add a dlc where you maybe go to Arizona and someone or something can save you from death because I'm not into the whole part where I go with Alt or I do the worst ending.
        “dlc where you maybe go to Arizona and someone or something can save you from death”

That would make a good transition to the sequel.(or whatever the online game ends up being)

2078 - where are saved but lose all your abilities As your body rejects it’s self.(hurray for skill resets in sequels)

I don’t know what the plot would be but there is a lot of room for things to happen. 

Possible plot lines-
Blackwall/AI might be loose thanks to you helping Alt. 

There is seems to be a war coming but it was just mentioned in the background.
    The afterlife legend one also gives hope. Blue eyes is an unusual mysterious figure and if you read notes it tells you he’s privy to info no one you’ve encountered so far has. He also makes the point that he knows you’ll do the job because you’ll do anything to survive, then just before you follow through on the job you make sure that he understands what you expect from the deal. On top of that, it utilizes the most talked about place that you can’t get to, the luxury space station. Presumably from the inaccessible island in the bay that has rockets leave it every so often.
        mr blue eyes is maybe also tied to the organisation that brainwashed peralez
        I was very disappointed that I didnt get to play out the space walk and continue. Feel like this should have played out.
    hope is an illusion.  OK, if you need hope, then go fucking blow your brains out.
        ...wut?
            That's a Johnny Silverhand line.
                Oh 😂😂😂 I was like "well that escalated quickly."
                    I felt the confusion in your comment xD
                        I was like that went from 0-100 so fast I got whiplash 😂
                            Yeah johnny is edgy.
    from a storytelling standpoint, panam's ending is the most likely to get a dlc. like tw3 blood and wine i suppose. where they end up in a new city (arizona?) and thus start a witch hunt for the cure to v's predicament. plus if I might add, although I like male v, I feel like the script was written for female V. dialogue exchanges do feel feminine.

for the romances, I think its pretty clear the best is panam for male v and Judy for fem v. again from a story standpoint, Judy leaves night city with you. River will not (ross and the kids, responsibilities). And Kerry is....well Kerry!
    i was afraid to pick this one because i don't want my panam to get killed.
    Whilst it was the closest to a happy ending, V is still 'dead'. Soulkiller zapped V when you plug into Mikoshi. What happens after is only an engram of V is created, and then uploaded into V's body.

This basically means the original V is dead, and a copy of his/her memory and personality survives in the body for ~6 months~ with a chance at curing their body so it doesn't die.

I can't really call that a happy ending. I wish there was an ending where Soulkiller is avoided completely with Johnny still removed and for V to survive with a chance of being cured long term.
    Hope? Man..  the whole game made me falsely believe that there is hope somewhere, and every time I opened a door, the game just slammed it in my face... 
Now I think they're just naive and not hopeful... Not the creators of the chip, not the Japanese, hell.. not even Alt, probably the smartest body of information being there is could save V...
If they do find a way in a future DLC, it will probably be so unbelievable and it will make me feel so much worse :/
    Cyberpunk 2 across the boarder? One can only hope.
    true she sacrifice so much and the family for V so here is no turning back even when its only 6 month at least panam is here until the end.
    There is the throwaway line about Vic's medicine and it sounds like V has some type of lethal auto-immune disease so "maybe" it's somewhat treatable (though to what extent/how much time you could buy isn't made clear). If it was treatable though, I would think Alt would know that, but eh maybe not. Still, I would've preferred instead of it being 6 months for the base time you're allotted it being more like a few years (or at least like 18 months, come on) would've been much better imo.
        Alt didn't take a number of things into consideration, so things it says shouldnt be considered absolute, even at the end.

In fact, I think Alt has a vested interest in Johnny getting the body and her getting V's engram
I dont like the fact that you always leave or something. I wish we could go back into the world as the V who completed the ending instead if going back and losing all the stuff you went through with the people you chose
    Yea the ending was nice but I don’t like how you need to load a old version of the game to keep playing
        Agreed, it feels so much better in skyrim for example when you end the game and come back and people remember what you did and their parts in the ending. Was much more satisfying imo. This one just leaves me lost on where to go from there
            find the secret ending ;)
                Isn't secret ending the "blaze of glory" one
                    definitely not coming back as V from that ending.


just did this ending last night and felt like an asshole lol
                        Ya both Jude and panam leaves u, while the male ones actually stay in the ending (vice versa if it's the panam ending)
                            spoilers

&#x200B;

Jude and panam left me, I did the finish with arkasia - but seems they were done with me way before then, even after finishing their stories
                                Ya no one likes the arisaka ending
                            for me, i had no relationships and never finished panam/judy storyline.


they both left messages in the credits asking me to call them sometime but acted like i was too busy/famous for them now.


dunno if the credit messages change depending on relations.

                                    > because they all said something like "Ah, voice mail again

I got the ending with Panam and only Rogue said that in the credits
                                Well you are among the top dogs in blaze of glory ending, plus might be super busy bcoz of the casino lmao.
                    isnt dont fear the reaper the secret one?
                        Ya I think so, bcoz u literally walk in the front door and nobody dies
        I always hate when open world games does this. Like, I went through hell only to... never have the satisfaction of *being* in a game with my accomplishment done? This is so backward.

Horizon did this. Breath of the Wild did this. Shadow of the Tomb Raider also.

Like, just let me free roam Night City with a freed, breathing and non-dying V, FFS. As it stand I would be doing side quests and free roam knowing my character is slowly dying anyway.
            Yeah I felt the story build really well because you have a constant motivation to be cured.... But as soon as you get "cured" it's game over and you have to go back to dying again. Spending all your time while you're dying doing odd jobs for random people feels out of character for V to be doing lol
            Ff15 did the same thing and it was the worst. Though I accept the Panam ending and thought it was great, I really wish they didnt have to leave. Maybe that ending will be the true ending and we'll get some return to NC dlc, lol.
            RDR2 as well. Seriously enough with this shit.
            Completely get what you're saying but this is where the medium is at odds with its neo-noir setting. From a player satisfaction perspective, you'd always want to give players the choice of continuing to experience the world after the story is over. But the game exists primarily to tell this story, and that sense of dread and urgency are a huge part of the atmosphere.

In other words: wait for mods, or invest in a PC and then wait for mods.
            That would be cool. But for some games like Horizon, it would be basically two different maps before and after the story. So the devs would have to work twice to make it good. Probably would’ve made the game launch way later or more probably would split the team on the both maps and then they would be only half as good.
    I could not agree more. It’s so incredibly frustrating that there’s no way to explore the unfathomably huge and detailed night city as a post-ending player character, simply exploring for exploring’s sake. Definitely makes the entire game less enjoyable imo
        Yeah man agreed
    I don't know, I think limiting the direction of the ending of the story just for the sake of continuity in post-ending gameplay would be a pretty awful idea in practice.
        Nah man its been done with many games to a very successful degree, you can look at skyrim as a massively popular game that pulled it off
    It reminds of of Breath of the Wild. You do all the quests and get all your gear then finally go to fight Ganon, who has plagued the world for 100 years, then once that's done you load back into your save before you fought Ganon. 

It made me feel really empty, as if everything I just did was pointless because the Hyrule I'm playing in is still an apocalyptic nightmare. Except with Cyberpunk, it felt even worse because the ending I got was so depressing.
I did the Panam ending which was pretty much exactly how I wanted my characters story to go...started as a corpo and turned into a nomad fed up with the city and corporate bs. Was really bummed out about the whole oooo well you now have 6 months to live shit. I hope that’s resolved with dlc cause if it isn’t I would really have much motivation to go back knowing all the endings are bummers no matter what.
    I’m with you with the whole 6 months thing. I know you’re kind of told that there’s no way to fix his condition but it would be cool for a dlc to expand on it and maybe find cure to V’s problem.
        I feel like an issue that is raised though is how DLC is going to handle the different endings. I haven’t finished the game yet, mind you, but I mean it sounds like in a lot of cases >!either V or Johnny end up in cyberspace or whatever depending on the player’s choice, so not everyone is going to have a V to play as in the DLC.!< Plus, I heard there’s an ending where >!both V and Johnny decide to end their lives on their own terms, meaning that they’d have no one at all to play as.!< 

I guess I’m just curious to know if the DLC will fix the problems that come along with the endings or if it’ll be something totally different where we play as a different character or something. Or maybe as Johnny in the past.
            In Witcher 3, the bad ending wasn't considered "canon" so they just based it off of the other ones and left it a little vague.

I'm actually wondering if they have a dlc planned that is all about picking up with months left to live and finding a cure, because it seems so odd that they would force V to be in that same circumstance no matter what happens. All you can really influence is V's attitude and methods, but V's circumstance is very similar in all of the ones where they live.

That spacewalk shit was stupid though.
                I think it’d be cool if they somehow worked the ending people chose into it, for sure. Like I know it’s unrealistic, but I chose >!to let Johnny take V’s body for a reason.!< To be told that my intentional ending doesn’t actually exist would suck. I imagine if someone got Ciri killed in the Witcher it was an accident (although anything is possible.) I picked >!Johnny over V because my V cared about him, would take a bullet for him, and realized that he could have a whole life while she would only get another 6 months.!< 

If they could tweak the storyline you mentioned so that Johnny >!in V’s body!< is trying to find a way to >!get ahold of new bodies and save V from behind the black wall or whatever!< it would be ideal for me. 

Of course that doesn’t solve the issue of the >!suicide!< ending but that one seems hard to come back from.
            I get what you mean but a Johnny DLC would be cool.
                It definitely would and it would work well since it would take place pre-game. 

I’m just wondering if and how the dlc’s can expand on the main story of the game since the endings would make it difficult.
                    Yeah, unless they make a different path for each ending in a dlc, it would be a lot of effort for an expansion. Or they make one ending canon but then that would make every other ending kinda pointless. Although I would love to see a continuation of the main story but I think if anything they’ll do a new story with a different main character.
                        Making one ending canon makes sense imo. The Panam ending is the "good" ending, and the only one with any real hope. Almost all other endings leads to the death of V.

Same situation if you give Johnny your body. It's no longer V in there, it's not "us". 

So yeah, the nomads ending seems to be the only ending with the possibility to branch out.
                            Well it might be possible that V survives the space casino heist
                                space casino V gave up on a cure. They live only to become the legend that will last.

Id say that Nomad ending and Arasaka ending (version where you go back to earth) are only ones that actually puts a way to find any cure.
                                    But blue eyes is like, if u succeed, then he could provide a cure???
                            Sorry, to chime in on an old thread but man... Those endings do not leave much hope for any sort of decent DLC continuing the story.

Making one ending "canon" completely removes player agency from the endings. I don't think the endings were very strong either.
                                Yup, the endings were weak AF.  Especially if you chose to identify with Johnny.  They strip the player of all agency in the Rogue mission option, which is garbage. They give you all the agency to try and patch things up with Rogue with conversation points and decisions that lead you to a point in the mission where her and Johnny agree to start fresh together then bam! It ignores all the effort you put in up to that point and does not make use of any decision points from prior.  Hell, Mass Effect 2 and Witcher 3 allowed all these things and its strange how CDPR chose to take this weird route where they give you all this agency only to strip it away right at the end.
                        Yeah it’s a tough situation because dropping people’s endings could cause even more drama, but one canon ending or a new story in the same world would make the most sense.

Either way I’m hoping for a continuation of my ending that results in a happy ending for both V and Johnny. Unrealistic, sure, but it’s my hope lol.
                            My hope is that they go back to fix the endings for Johnny so that Rogue doesnt get fragged or at least put in some method where your conversation decisions/skills allow you to interrupt Smasher's sequence.  Huge missed opportunity there and really sours the game for me so much so that it makes replaying it in the current state unpalatable.
            You can easily do it just by telling players that the DLC is accessible if you achieved X,Y, or Z ending, and not on the other options.  It's not like anyone would be locked out, because the game saves automatically before talking to Hanako and takes you back to there if you choose to keepin playing.

So you could easily have the DLC be accessible for any of the "6 months to live" endings.
            \[spoilers for Mass Effect and Fallout\]  


 imagine it'll be like Mass Effect 3, where it was possible to have a canon ending to your mission back in Mass Effect 2, but if you play 3 it's assumed you're branching from a different point  


Or like in Fallout 3, where if you get the DLC you survive your sacrifice
    It really does feel like dlc fodder. Will they follow through, we'll see.
I find it f****** to be honest. The fact that you work so hard on surviving only to have it all for nothing. Then to make things worse you cannot continue to play once you complete the last mission.
    This right here. I've never been more disappointed by any narrative as I am now. CDPR really couldn't just add a branch which allows you to live like normal? It's almost as if they want bad reviews.
        arguably a branch where you'd be just allowed to live; a "happy end", would go against many of the things this game sets forward. The World is dystopic, there are no happy ends, just degree's of bad and at least on my part I felt sort of empty and sad so its done its job messing with my feelings. Also think that's intentional.
            While I don't disagree that Night City is a dystopia, the game is full of moments and characters that constantly reinforce the idea that there are bonds and ideals that the corporations cannot crush. Nothing about Jackie or his family is dystopian, Johnny's bond with Rogue persists after 50 years, Panam and the Aldocaldos are repeatedly depicted as a tight bond outside the corporate structure, V can choose to be merciful in several major moments, Viktor and Misty are objectively good people, and so on. There are many good endings to stories in Night City (or at least, positive endings to certain chapters), so to say to the player that no matter what they do they're fucked takes away from a large part of what the game has said over the last (in my case) 50 hours.
                Yup, they give you agency to be a good person with reinforcing mechanisms around you from Jackie/Misty to Johnny/Rogue to V/love interest.  After 90 hours of playtime where they build you up with hope to then suddenly tear it away at every option was just not good.  I identified with Johnny through my play through and even got the bond with V pretty high so towards the point of no return i went through the heart wrenching goodbyes to Panam and then played as Johnny.  Throughout the entire mission it gives you hope that, even after 50 years, shes still in love with you as you are with her.  Right at the point where your character and her decide to start fresh everything gets smashed.  At that point, none of your choices matter and every end point is just a depressing mess.  Reading about the other endings makes it all the more depressing.

This is starting to feel like those "subverting expectations" style writing courses they try to do and the story just slaps you down hard no matter what.  Makes replayability very low as there is virtually no good outcome. Like honestly, how is Mass Effect 2 still the gold standard on this stuff after so long???  The game gave you agency to bond with characters and affect their end game while so many games continue to do this all or nothing stuff.  

I should have been able to save Rogue during the final assault instead of watching her die and in the end being Johnny where everyone i know or knew is dead is just not a good way to run a story for which you want a person to assume the identity for.
                It's the thing that I got from it. Yeah the corps' greed are squeezing whatever they can from the environment and don't care if they grind everyone into dust in the process, but they haven't. With all their power and might and tech people are still people. As utterly terrifying as Night City is there is still beauty in it, people still find beauty in it that doesn't revolve around the kill or be kill mentality.

The fact that every ending is damn near kicking your feet out from under you and laughing at you for thinking that has really left a sour taste in my mouth. Got 3 of the 5 ending sequences and uninstalled. Might come back to it in a year when as much of the stuff is fixed as possible but for now think I'm done.
            there's a happy end for literally all of the people you choose to spend time with.

so....CDR is doing a have your cake and eat it too moment. Like Viktor Vektor? Heck, just be nice to him. He's happy and your friend. Like Panam? Fuck it, go shoot shit up with her. Like Judy? Be there for her. Any1 u like you can get a happy ending for. Except yourself. Oh and except Jackie. And that's supposed to teach you some deep lesson about the dark world of CyBeRpUnK. 

The thing isn't even internally consistent.
            > arguably a branch where you'd be just allowed to live; a "happy end"

Not dying is not a happy ending. A happy ending would be you make so much money that you can retire rich and young, kinda like GTAV.

I was hoping V could live to fight another day. You can tell whoever wrote the endings in no way shape or form played the game except maybe a couple hours.
            No matter what, I experienced a hard to forget story and moved by it a lot, connected with the very well made side characters and amazed by the story of the game, even if it messed with my feelings like you said.

I'm happy with endings actually, it wouldn't feel organic and realistic this much if V wouldn't have been dying no matter what. I'm on the same page with you.

Edit: As for the sequel, I hope they create a new character, maybe tying it with V in the event chain of history somehow. I really hope they don't pull an unrealistic and hard to believe trick to bring V back. Things that can't be done by Arasaka or Alt, also shouldn't be available to Mr. Blue Eyes.
            How is it dystopic when the game offers to give the body to johnny, who gets to live? In every scenario V is the only one who gets absolutely fucked, even Johnny can live if the player chooses to.
                Johnny taking over your body and leaving the city is essentially the most positive ending, V doesn’t suffer anymore and Johnny is essentially redeemed of his douchey old ways and he moves on...
            They can still do this ending... While letting you continue to play the game after  it's done... I mean it just seems like they had to shove this thing out the door.
            It’s a game, it meant to be make people happy and plus it’s not like we are asking let that be the ONLY ending, you still have many choices. 

They just tucked up the story like what TLOU2 did
        You would give it a bad review for not having a happy ending?
            Yeah i don’t understand where a lot of these people are coming from either. Not all stories have happy endings, and V is in a pretty damn rough spot to begin with. There are hints throughout the game that things in Night City rarely end well, and V’s story goes along perfectly for that
    Goes back to the original question from Dex, quiet life or blaze of glory?  We were set up for this fatalistic ending the entire time I suppose- and the theme of "night city's broken promises and dreams" was reiterated constantly.  Blaze of glory?  You're dead, maybe a legend about you but still dead.  Quiet life, you just go out peacefully.
    it's a fail on basic entry level storytelling
Honestly they were amazing. It still sucks that >!V still dies in every choice, !<though its one of the best gaming stories I've have the pleasure of playing.
    They might not if they do the secret ending. Can't find jack shit about it though but apparently they live on
    I thought v doesnt die in the panam ending
        V dies in 6 months no matter what you do for this ending.
            technically he's going to die, no reason in a DLC they couldn't find some miracle ripperdoc who can fix V or some other bullshit cure from a Corp.
                I highly doubt that DLC's will extend/explain the endings. It's most likely gonna be something like Johnny DLC or V/Jackie old days DLC.
                    I don't think they'd do that tbh. I feel like any DLC might even be a separate character at this point. Pretty stupid way to end the game IMO. The problem with multiple choice endings is a DLC continuing them would most likely invalidate some of the endings... Which is I've always hated in RPGs. 

It removes player choice.
                        Use your imagination Choom,  think about how the game ended it branches out in the end with the Major choices, but more or less the same outcome. 

DLC could start branched out as well.

Here how I would like to see it:
1. you load up the Brand new DLC
2. A prompt pops up and asks you what Ending you chose.
3.You choose and the game starts a a Short Prologue basically on whatever you chose but will braid your "Past" into more Linear Story DLC.

You know, like the Lifepath thing at the start, nomad, Streetkid , Corpo.. you started differently but ended up meeting Jackie, took Dexs Job, etc.etc. 

That's how this could work, but.. not every ending, like Jonny taking over wouldn't work for my Theory or possibly the Arasaka ending (? Havent played that one yet ,so please no spoilers)

In which case I would see that they would pull the same thing they did on the Blood and Wine DLC where only the "good" endings will be Cannon.

Also because I doubt they will get Keanu Reeves to Voice Jonny for a whole freaking DLC "Branch" probably expensive  as hell.
                            Before you meet Hanako you get a call, to save your life and continue living, by doing so you get none of the shit ass gonk endings, canon af bruh. I will direct it 100% choom, its gonna be preem.
                            >Use your imagination Choom,  think about how the game ended it branches out in the end with the Major choices, but more or less the same outcome.

So it either means that the developers have to pick an ending to be canon. Which is fucking stupid in an open ended game. Might as well not allowed for multiple endings at all in that case. Removes all player agency from the main story. Which was my point.

or

It means they have to craft some sort of DLC that incorporates all of the endings... Including the ones where Johnny takes over V's body and leaves the city. Which seems nigh impossible especially for CDprojectRed to handle correctly.

&#x200B;

I don't think they "can't" do it. I just think the endings are varied enough that they may go with Option 1. Which is super lame.
                                Well I would guess that some endings would be disabled , as I said I doubt they would get Keanu into this game again expect for maybe a couple of one liners.

So I would assume that some endings are considered .. bad endings which wouldn't progress into a Story DLC.. just like the suicide one.

But the main endings , Night City Afterlife Boss and the Nomad one could very definitely be continued which like I said would simply branch out at the beginning only to twirl into a linear story just like the beginning of the game , and if you think about it, there are only 3 endings which would make sense to continue on Nomad, Afterlife Boss, and Return from the Arasaka Space station..
            You dont know that. Its pretty clearly, and intentionally, open ended. Probably so they have something to use for sequels/dlc.
                I mean Alt that fucking AI told us so and that shit is probably the smartest thing around in the Cyberpunk universe and if you pick the Arasaka ending the smartest brains in Arasaka reached the same conclusion so I don't really see how V can be saved if the best possible candidates for saving her life were both pretty  set on her dying in 6 months.

But there is to hoping I guess.
                    That kinda ruined the game for me. I reached the point of no return tonight and upon reading about it I ended being spoiled by the whole ending. No hard feelings though, but during my playthrough I was hard focused on the main quest as I wanted to save V and save her life ASAP since this was obviously an urgency, I would then focus on the other content afterward.

Turns out that not only its a lost cause, but I'm thrown back pre point of no return after the end anyway. Which condemn me to forever be stuck with an AI slowly killing V in all my future playthrough/free roam sessions.

It sucks.
                        Yup I feel you hard, exactly how I played my V and I want to feel like all my work to cure V meant something. I wanna be in night city not as someone slowly dying so I don't feel weird doing all this side content that just feels out of place for V to be doing
                            This reminds me we’ll forever be plagged by the random OLD RELIC MALFUNCTION condition until the end of time since we never truly get rid of that.

Best design decision ever lol
                        >Turns out that not only its a lost cause, but I'm thrown back pre point of no return after the end anyway. Which condemn me to forever be stuck with an AI slowly killing V in all my future playthrough/free roam sessions.  
>  
>It sucks.

100% this. I played a game a similar way until I got to the point of no return. Then I did all the side content but like... Most of it felt super frivolous. Let me go scuba diving while this AI is frying my mind... It doesn't make sense narratively.

I was hoping, like you, for an ending that would allow me to re-enter the world and do all the side shit after finishing the main story. But it's all tied to Johnny, which was a mistake, so I understand why they did it the way the did... CDPR has a problem with story writing this way. Witcher 3 had similar problems.
                    Alt isn't the smartest thing though, she said it herself. She can't use soulkiller to its fullest capabilities after all the Arasaka changes.


Also, best candidates yet. Remember there are private networks like the voodoo boys that netwatch is trying to control. Plus, a whole unexplored world.
                    Super late to the party but I would note that Alt is very deliberately *not* depicted as omniscient or flawless (She has to wipe out the Voodoo boys to save herself from Netwatch if you trust the Netwatch agent, she says she's been trying and failing to breach Mikoshi for 50 years, she obviously screws up V's diagnosis (assuming Alt wasn't lying, which we have no reason to think she was)). 

In the Arisaka ending Hellman analogizes what has happened to V as similar to the damage inflicted by radiation poisoning, but tbh that line was reasonably comforting to me: It's the year 2077 and you're telling me no one anywhere has figured out radiation poisoning, not even to mitigate it?? 

Beyond that, the reason people like the Panam ending is that it is the only ending that is geared towards leaving the player with hop: Hope for a cure, but also (and separately) hope for an escape from the dystopia they have been living in for the last 20-60 hours. I would have lived to see more ambiguity, or just flat out more hope, from the other ostensibly legitimate and good endings.
                        How tf can adam smasher live looking like he does but V cant lol, there has to be a way.
                            Adam's basically a complete cyber body, which is sort of why the Arisaka endings don't bother me. 

Assuming that at some point they will get the risks of a fully cyber body down to a tolerable level, then getting engram'd and then stuffed in a cyberframe later on is fine.
                                One of the side missions suggests editing engrams is possible. Wouldn’t want to emerge as diet V in a new body with all negative tendencies eliminated (as defined by Arasaka).
                You die no matter what. As soon as you enter mikoshi alt uses soulkiller on you and creates an engram, a copy of you. Is a copy of you really you? What makes you you?
            Damn thats kind of disappointing. I wonder what they might do for expansions then.
                Could be another protagonists story. I like to think that V was our introduction into the CP77 universe; or it could be early / mid-game expansions + possibly new endings who knows.
                    Another protag will make all of cyberpunk feel so wasted though.. like u make ur own char, ur own choices and relationships and now u gotta make a new protag? Nah, i hope not
                        What's wrong with telling multiple stories in Night city? V became a Legend, would be interesting to hear about them and maybe run into old friends time to time while you make new ones

I really liked how Gta4 did this with it's DLC, same world different stories
                            Well for gta4 we still got a definitive ending for Niko, there are way too many loose ends for cyberpunk.

2. Im ok playing with another character for a sequel. The story for V seems unfinished and the devs possibly made it so open-ended for reason.
                    i'm betting that they will just be addtional quests in the world, so you need to load a save before the final mission anyway.
                        I feel like the story was created to make the multiplayer have respawning in the lore. I feel like the DLC will also incorporate the immortality factor after Arisaka discovers the chip works.
                            Not like the cloning vats haven't been a thing in other major cyberpunk fiction. Cyberpunk is a perfect precursor to worlds like altered carbon.
            Not necessarily, he has about 6 months to live but nothing says he can't find a cure in that time. The end credits could imply that he's dead and therefore can't answer. But on the all along the watchtower mission you can talk with cassidy and his dialogue gives me major vibes that V doesn't die, as long as you don't think he will and think that you will survive. That it's all about outlook.  
Realistically it doesn't look great for V but you never know.
                Yup got the same vibe. Got the same feeling at the end of MGS when Snake gets Fox Die and Naomi says there is no way to know when he will die and he just has to live (and he does, for quite a while). Plus there are several Kojima references in the game.
            One of the endings hints that Delamain might be able to help V. 

&#x200B;

I think the "cure" will still come in the form of some AI related bullshit. 

&#x200B;

I'll say I'm disappointed in the endgame in general. The endgame felt rushed much like the latter 1/3 of the Witcher 3 felt empty.
        He doesn't. Im guessing they're saving up this ending for a possible sequel/dlc in search of a cure.
            Yea that was my thought at first too.
        I'll just wait for mods. Then V lives. lol.
            Step 1 of grief:Denial
    I thought the story was great, but the endings were shit.
    V doesn'T die in the Arasaka contract ending no?

Or is it assumed that they will not find a body for him?
First i ended up with Hanako's offer (i was scared, that with Panam's help, she could die) .. at space station, i decided to live and get back to Panam, but story ended there. So i loaded back and decide for the Panam's help.. I think it is the best ending for V - freedom.  


There are 2 secret endings, did anyone try them?
    Did the same thing as you, jesus the Hanako ending is depressing (for a character that romances Judy and befriends Panam). You're a test rabbit in a cyberstation and by the time you return to Night City all the people you cared for are gone and you live your last 6 months in pain, misery and loneliness.

But the Panam ending is soo good, I really hope its canon and we get a DLC where they find someone who cures V. Also really hope they make another game, maybe exploring Europe or USSR as there is a lot of mentions of this.
    I was really mad at the Hanako ending. >!She says "Help me and I'll get you into Mikoshi". Fine ok. At no point does it become clear that I'm not going through with my Alt / Johnny plan of separating us inside the subnet, and that instead I'm literally choosing to murder Johnny. A full on assault of the tower wasn't the role I was playing V as, so it seemed the most in character for me to choose the other, and it ended up being completely the opposite of "in character."!<

>!What I DID like about that ending was the sort of double cross with the whole Saburo / Yorinobu thing and Hanako's true intentions. !<

&#x200B;

It's a little like when the dialogue option doesn't line up with what V actually says, or doesn't make clear the tone / intention with which V will deliver the line, so you end up pissing people off, when the option you picked actually seemed like the "nice" thing to say.
        fuuuuuuucking PREACH.

Just another incomplete game. A little hole they didn't patch.

Actually...can you do the voodoo thing at all? Guess they just ran out of time or whatever.

:/ why is every game I play like this? It always ends with a great plan (either mentioned and forgotten, or something obvious never mentioned) being completely overwritten by a bunch of shit someone 'clever' threw up? OoOoOoO NiGhT cItY sTeAlS yOuR IdEnTiTy.

nah bitch. I beat night city. And if the game had let me give Jacquito any one of the 112 medi-injector things in my pocket, we woulda beat it together.

I think you can beat life too. But nah, every fucking artist out there wants to force me to fail to teach me some life lesson they just figured out.

Been through those failures. Learned from them. Changed. But in the long run? The real lesson is: don't waste your time sticking around in failure.
    one is V takes on Arisaka solo and lives. If you fail at any point you restart at the point of no return.
        How do you get that ending?
            You need 70% you only live once. And then when you have to chose how to raid the tower you select the johnny and rouge one and sit there for a few minutes. From what I can tell to get 70% all you have to do is do all the johnny side quests and when your at where he's buried say he saved your life then say he fucked up then give him another chance.
                damn, gonna need to try that out in a second playthrough, i only got that thing to 60%
                Is this confirmed? I‘ve read varying things about supporting him throughout the game but not to the point of being a suck up.

Can‘t remember what I said at his grave. But I was stuck at 60% as well.

Actually quite looking forward to NG+ when it‘s out. Maybe together with the actual PS5 version. In that playthrough I could save Takemura as well.
                    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CubJ5M6aQGY&

Follow this. I reloaded a manual save, followed these dialogue options when visiting Johnny's grave, and didn't even complete the band side quests after. My score was at 50% and I was still able to get the secret ending option to trigger. All the enemies are level 50 in that ending, though. And it doesn't really change the ending you get post-choice.
                        "Doesn't really change the ending" meaning V still has 6 months to live?
                            Thats, right. V still only has 6 months to live... Only thing that really changes is rogue and the nomads are still alive.
                    I did it myself so I'm pretty sure it's correct unless there is another important aspect I just happened to do throughout my playthrough without realising. I was at 60% (and couldn't do the solo ending) went back a few hours re did the grave sequence with everything else the same, got to 70% and could now do the solo ending.
Warning, lots of text ahead, also, fairly specific spoilers I guess:

What bothers me the most is that the one I got/picked (Arasaka, signed contract) just ends abruptly in the what seems like the middle of the outcome with little to no indication of what happens exactly. I kind of get why they end it there, cause I guess that's where V's consciousness leaves their body, but like, what happens though ? 

You can voice a concern that they might just leave you trapped in mind-prison and Hellman says there's not double-cross so does that mean they definitely don't do that ? 

They say finding a compatible body will be harder than for their old CEO, but don't make it sound impossible or like it would take that long, but it's still really vague how long you'll stay in Mikoshi before they "incarnate" you back to life. 

Also to the above, it's mentioned a few time in game that "full chrome" exists, being essentially Ghost in the Shell style full cyborgs, couldn't they do that for V if organic body compatibility is a concern ? It probably costs a lot but they're probably already spending a lot on you anyway, and Hellman says some very rich clients have signed a similar contract to the one they offer you for free, which has to also be expensive as hell. 

It's also left unclear what the exact deal is aside "you'll be a mind in a close cyberspace for a bit, technically our property temporarily, but you'll get a new body and not be actively dying anymore". But like, are you free to go after that ? Is it just a repayment gift for helping unfuck their company ? Do they want you on hand to study you even post-new body ? Does the contract make you a employee of Arasaka ? The boss or Hanako could make you their bodyguard/enforcer or something, so you'd have to become a Corpo to live. 

Speaking of, I get Johnny being mighty pissed at V choosing Asakara, cause he's all anti-corp and hates that corp the most specifically, but he and kinda by extension the game (and Misty) seems to treat it like it's some huge traitor move and you're "betraying yourself". But it's like, no ? I've been saying I wanna live no matter what from the start, and I only really helped Arasaka against itself, if anything the corporation will hurt less people because I helped them. The only better alternative would be to destroy or significantly cripple them but let's be honest, that's not happening. Like dude you nuked their HQ and it didn't change anything, wtf do you want ? 

Side note to Misty, yes, Arasaka killed Jackie, sure, while he was stealing from them. Like apparently I'm an asshole because I helped a corpo boss kill another corpo boss who was a war-mongering jackass (and the one who was technically in charge when Jackie died btw) in exchange for them stopping me from dying horribly, just because guards from the company of that corpo boss happened to be the ones who took down your bf whose job involves endangering his life all the time ? Like if he had gotten killed by Militech mooks or gangers instead, would she be fine with it then ?

&#x200B;

As for the other endings, I guess 1st of all is the alt Asakara one where you don't sign. Which btw since they let you do that, even packing your things for you in case that would be your choice, seems a fairly strong indication to me that they are legit saving you as a gift for helping them, since you're on a space station, they could keep you there if they wanted to experiment or mind-prison you or whatever, but no, they legit let you leave. Back on topic though, I don't like it cause you still for sure die, even though the goal from that start was to not die. Which is fine, there's reasons you'd RP that, but it's not for me. 

The Panam one seems nice though, aside that I'm pretty skeptical the nomads will find a way to fix you (aside like stealing a full-chrome body or those new super-nanobots that fix nerve damage from the in-game ads), just not sure how they're supposed to help with radiation-sickness levels of DNA damage. I mean even the absurdly rich and powerful Arasaka corp just goes "yeah, your current body is fucked, gonna have to change it", but the desert mechanics are like "eh maybe we can fix this". 

Raiding Arasaka and saving yourself by force against a corp is probably the most expected ending, since trying to save yourself and fighting the power is mostly what V and their allies do all game. So it's cool, but you still for-sure die later. 

Giving your body to Johnny is bafflingly bad to me, YMMV obv but goddamn why tf would you ever do that ? 

And finally just killing yourself. Which, I mean, it's bad obviously. Clearly the designated bad ending. But the option gotta be there so that's fine. What I'd really complain about it is, after you pick the choice all dialogue is an automatic convo with Johnny on good terms. Wouldn't that be jarring AF if your V hates him all game long then acts like buddies cause you picked suicide ? He could be all "Fuck Arasaka man, no deal, let's go blow them up" and you're like "Nope, eat shit douchebag" \*bang\*

Overall I still think the ending I got is my favorite, or Panam's would be if it turns out the nomads can actually somehow save you.
    I agree with all points. I took the contact with Arasaka because I skipped the Rogue quest line and didn't really see the point in storming the HQ with the nomads. Arasaka was the only option I felt had any future besides dying in 6 months or becoming an AI. They straddled the line of making it a bad or good ending. Bleak but open ended like you said.  I was just glad to be rid of Johnny honestly. Mostly because his relationship felt forced upon you. Like you were supposed to like him in the end no matter what you wanted for V.
        [removed]
            Regardless of which ending you get, the game definitely "just ends". And all of the main characters cease to exist. I probably won't pick it back up until DLC arrives or I finally get a 3080 and just want to see the graphics.
                [removed]
                    I was surprised how much the corpo lifestyle was painted as the "wrong" choice. I guess you're technically ex-corpo, but still. Got annoying at the end having Johnny pushing against it so much. I feel like a more fleshed out background system would have the corpo choice take over Arasaka to use the tech for yourself.
                        [removed]
    Yeah I romanced Judy and her video message at the end was vague but kinda mean. She just kind of said "I'm leaving town. Fuck this City. You either become an asshole, or get taken advantage of by one. Have a nice life." Like...? I have six months to live and I'm literally coming back to Earth. Did I miss something? Did Arasaka kill her parents?

Adding this: I did the suicide ending first because I wanted V to have the final say since Johnny was such an overbearing, annoying, and malicious prick all 40 hours. Seeing him sit next to you all like "you know, this outcome is alright with me, too." I don't fucking care, that's WHY I'm doing this.
        Out of twisted curiosity I choose it too, because I wanted to see all endings and I knew it'd end the game right then and there, and the call from Judy was one of the most emotional scenes I've seen in a game.  Really hit me in the feels.
            [deleted]
                That was absolutely devastating. Really well voice acted.
                    I just "finished" the game with this ending. I did not know that this would happen, as I thought, this would be a suicide attack with both being half in half in charge.  


It broke my heart. I am not happy with this one bit....  


But then again, while I would choose the Panam ending with Judy by my side, I do not see a reason why I would risk my new found family with such an attack on Arasaka.  


Especially when I played a sneaking, hacking V, I would have liked to get an option to do this on my own terms so to speak.  


I will most likely not go back to play with this character again.   
As all the other options now seems cheesy for me.   
Gonna start a new character I guess and then go with Panam and Judy.

But this incarnation of V .. well, she killed herself.... even if I would no have wanted this to happen and it not making sense in my headcanon on how I played her :/  
Well, can´t win it all everytime, tough luck I guess.
    Don't want to be a corporate shill but in a dystopian future like cyberpunk where technology is above all else I think the ending with Hanako and signing the contract is the best, I know johnny point of view where corporations are getting out of hand but litarally it's to late to do anything, they are litarally gods not even countries can do much against them if V's goal is to be big there is only 2 option, die a legend like johnny or join the ones at the top. I know it's bleak but hey it's a dystopian setting can you really expect a happy ending. This game reminds me a lot of altered carbon, the Netflix tv show. The ending of this game is what I imagined when humanity cheated death, yes it will only be affordable to the rich first just like any technology but give it a few decades it will trickle down to the common people. This will probably expedite the process in which the earth condition gets worse due to earth quickly dwindling resources but millitech seems to have their sights on mars and other plants so maybe it is best.
        Based on other endings, arasaka falls into ruins after V's intervention, so I don't think soulkiller is the way to go about saving V.
            when you load up v's brain, arasaka is taken over by an engram of the old guy. They guy that started arasaka. He is downloaded into his son's body. And it all works out. He doesn't go to war with Militech.....etc
                He is now immortal which is probably the worst scenario out of any.

If you take the Johnny or Nomad endings, Arasaka basically falls into ruins.
    I like this one the best too, this is the only one in a sense where V continues to live.

Tho its likely the darkest one, as theres the possibility shes trapped forever. But at least on this ending, her fate isnt entirely decided. 

Arasaka corp has also made breakthroughs with the resurrection of their father. This could just be another opportunity to continue the breakthrough. 

Its grim, dark, and uncomfortable, but its definitely gonna push people away. But i think it was her best chance.
        I knew probably 10 hours into my 70 hour playthrough that the game would give me the choice of getting made into a construct.  You could see it a long time coming.  I knew that's what I wanted to do, but when I was sitting there in the space station, I thought about it and decided to return to earth.  Looking back at all the character developments and relations, I didn't think it was fair to leave it all behind and sell my soul to arasaka.  I think I made the right choice in that regard because if you play some of the other endings, you'll notice most of them make mention of Arasaka going down in some form.  IIRC they called the "secure your soul" program a "curse" in one of them.
            >you'll notice most of them make mention of Arasaka going down in some form.  IIRC they called the "secure your soul" program a "curse" in one of them

In the Panem ending there's a terminal in Arasaka tower with some emails that say "Secure Your Soul" actually wasn't working very well yet, there's a list of people it was used on and most were seriously injured/killed by it or their construct didn't come out right.  It also said the real reason for the program was for Arasaka to extract blackmail from the constructs.  Perhaps that all gets revealed to the public in the endings where you attack the tower?
    What I got upset about Arasaka is that there were factions within the company yet they didn't develop into anything. Are you saying I couldn't have helped Yorinobu or this apparent liberal grand-daughter, I just had to choose the porcelain girl?  


Knowing that Yorinobu was waging war against the other companies so they would all crumble with in fighting makes me think that destroying Arasaka is just whatever. Militech, Biotechica or another massive corporation will just take over.
        That would have been neat, more choice is always good. That said though I'd still side with Hanako, Yorinobu is starting shit with other corps and corpo wars is bad for normal people.
    Yea the in game ads about the nanobot therapy costing 700,000 a month or whatever are what I think the DLC might be about.
    >Giving your body to Johnny is bafflingly bad to me, YMMV obv but goddamn why tf would you ever do that ?

For me, it was less "giving V's body to Johnny" and more "picking the option that allows V to survive more than 6 months". In theory, it was the best option for all involved: Johnny gets a body with a full lifespan ahead of it, and V gets to live indefinitely as an AI. But since V apparently didn't contact anyone afterwards, judging from the reactions in the credits, I can only assume either something went wrong or I misinterpreted something. Especially given Misty's reaction.
    Re: giving your body to Johnny

Personally I think it's a pretty reasonable option for a lot of people. If your relationship with him was bad then I definitely agree it's a pretty terrible option, but if you had a decent or good relationship to him then I don't think it's weird at all. If you were in a hypothetical situation where you could choose between living for 6 months or a friend living out a natural life, it doesn't seem far-fetched at all that some people would want to choose the latter. From a purely utilitarian viewpoint there's no question, though of course the real world isn't a hypothetical utilitarian ideal, but the general logic is there. I'm either going to die now or die in 6 months, but my friend could go on living a full life. Doesn't seem unreasonable to sacrifice the little life you have left for someone to live out the rest of their life.
    I also thought of the same when I first got the Arasaka ending. But there's one thing that I couldn't deal with, was Saburo got reincarnated over his son. That shit was evil.

Then I tried Panam's ending which unleashed Alt to fuck up Mikoshi and thus Arasaka felt damn satisfying.
    Thing with getting soulkilled is not only, well, V dies, but it's evident from other endings that Arasaka kind of falls into ruin following the events of V's intervention.
        Not sure what you mean. Helping them get rid of Yorinobu unfucks what he was fucking up. And in the  other endings you really only fuck over Mikoshi, not the entire megacorp.

And the mind uploading is only "dying" in the sense that your body stops working. Your mind is fine. You even probably get a new body later.
Honestly wish they worked in a way were Jonny just lived in your head
    A "fusion" ending where they both shared the body or combined and became one person is what I wanted.
        What did I invest 20 points into intelligence for if not for a Delamaine-style merger of minds???
        EXACTLY. I really thought that would be an option if I did enough of Johnny's quests, but nope.
    he even keeps talking to you in the space station, i had hopes at that time that we would be able to just return to night city life with him and the synthesia and everything but nope, gotta kill the player up there in orbit and make me reload like nothing happened. i mean... what the fuck? the game felt super exiciting just moments ago, and then you slam the breaks? what story telling is this
        It could be just memories not Johnny but who knows
    That'd be nice- find a way to maintain the current state, stop it from progressing.
    I found it strange there were no "middle path" options
I was really pissed after finishing the game and getting the path to glory epilouge, it was a bitter sweet ending for me, i made Vs dream come to which was becoming a night city legend. But then i was still mad about how he wasnt able to get saved and continue living his life. No matter what ending u get to decide to get u will not return to night city open world. U will simply have to continue from ur last open world save meaning u will never get a sense/ feeling of completion. Really wished they added a ending where V gets fixed and returns to night city working as a merc
    This. This is exactly what I wanted too.
        So irritating, I refuse to play the game until they fix it in a dlc or som, or I just won’t touch the game whatsoever
    I just finished the game and am super pissed.  Making me go through all the effort to patch things up with people as Johnny and holding out hopes that you can start fresh with Rogue only to have everything come crashing down as a surprise fuck you moment is just not cool.  Reading about all these endings just makes me even more pissed because there just simply isnt any way for you to positively affect the outcome or take agency in your own ending.  Everything is just "too bad! Gotcha! You're dead!"
    What do you have to do to get a drink named after you?
I think the first big expansion will be Crystal Palace, cause it perfectly ties into one of the endings. They will probably make that ending canon.

The endings are kinda meh, since even the better ones mean your life will be over in 6 months. Also I feel really helpless as protagonist, there are so many people you could not protect in the story, while some of the worst monsters got away, that I feel as if I did not make much of an impact.

        Yes, but the game repeatedly breaks the rules for the genre and the tropes.

When you kill off a beloved character early in the game, you need to have other equally loved characters ready to take over. That worked in the first book of GoT, but here it does not work, they relied way too much on the "Oh it's Keanu" factor. And Keanu does not really do anything until the late parts of the game. 

When you have a doomed hero, then he better be able to save the people around him, cause otherwise his sacrifice is empty. Instead V loses Jackie, Evelyn Parker (who had an especially horrible fate), Rogue and probably a few more. Examples, John Hartigan or Marv in Sin City, they knew they were doomed, but made a difference.

Also the game breaks it's own code that it kept stressing: If you rather want to die in a blaze of glory, or have a long life as a nobody. When you side with Arasaka you get the worst ending possible, despite selling out.

Also it's still a game, meant for entertainment. If I wanted a sad "Everything is awful" story, I could read 1984 or similar books...
            [deleted]
                > I mean the point of the story is more about the journey than the end

V even says this multiple times through the game.
                I don't know, I still didn't finish the game but I already feel awful, I knew that it won't be a "happy game" but in my foolishness I hoped that my choice will matter a little more. 

I wonder... maybe it wouldn't hit me that hard if the 2020 was different, but with how it was, I wish that at least I could do some "happy endings" for other characters...
            Disagree the game doesn't break its own code; siding with arasaka is the only way you can live on. But by doing that you're betraying your values, your friends, ur love interests, literally everybody. All the non-arasaka endings have some sense of living a short life in a blaze of glory
                That's the strongest hint to the contract actually saving your life imo. Dialogue and lore can be argued but it makes a lot of sense thematically and narratively. 

I just disagree with the game's implications that you really betray that much.
                Nope. Cause the Arasaka ending does not mean you live on, Takamura tells you himself that the surgery did not save you and that you only have a  few months left. 

Your only choice at this point is to go back to Earth, as a half-lobotomized shadow of yourself and die in a few months.....

Or to upload a copy of yourself to Mikoshi, while your original body will die and you sign yourself and all your rights over to Arasaka. A cruel twist on the promise of "saving" your life. 

The Arasaka endings are the worst possible outcomes. Cause you neither have a blaze of glory, nor did you save your own life. 

The Arasaka ending needs a complete rewrite: they save your worthless ass and "kill" Johnny. You should be rewarded with a corner office in the Arasaka corp, as another faceless stooge bound to them. Now you got your "long life", if you wanna call that a life. It would have fit your betrayal and the desire to save yourself way better and would have been in line with the "Survival at any cost" playstyle.

They also should have allowed us to betray Arasaka in the scene in the tower and let us kill Yorinobu, his sister and Hellman, at the cost of your own life (as an option of "last second remorse"). But I can understand the reason why they did not allow that, because by the time you are in the tower you already made your decision to trust Arasaka. A terrible mistake.
                    Arisaka ending isn't the worst. It's one of the only 2 (maybe 3 if you think nomads can actually save you) endings that can potentially save V. They aren't going to keep you prisoner because they will let you leave if you want. Signing the contract is just legal shit in case they never find a way to put you back into a body. This ending can leave you "alive" at an unspecified later date. The other one being working with Mr Blue in the afterlife to do the Crystal Palace Heist because he seems to be offering V something more valuable than money (which V has a ton of at this point) meaning it could be a solution to their problem. This ending has the highest chances of a DLC because you can actually play it out.
            Hard disagree.

The cyberpunk genre is defined by melancholic endings.

Johnny literally says at one point in the panam ending "not in this town, not to people like us" when V asks for a happy ending.

That's cyberpunk.
                Nope, read what the creator had to say in an interview from Dec 2020 (also my character is not a terrorist like Johnny):

“*Cyberpunk* is political, but it’s not political in a  blue-state-red-state-conservative-liberal \[way\],” he says. “It is  basically \[that\] people deserve to be able to get a decent meal, live in  a decent place and do all that if they’re willing to work for it, and  not get screwed over by people more powerful than they are, who may not  need to even screw them over, but are doing it on principle because they  think they can do it.”

Thankfully, in the game at least, that’s where the heroes come in. “Characters in *Cyberpunk*  are heroes, and survive and do well because they are willing to fight  for family or friends, for their neighbourhoods,” Pondsmith tells us.

            >  If you rather want to die in a blaze of glory, or have a long life as a nobody.

EXACTLY THIS. I was so hyped to blow up the new Arasaka tower like Johnny did in the past, or something major that impacts the world, but it feels like your death is completely meaningless! What happened to getting ourselves remebered in The Afterlife?
It felt like the game had so much build up but just fizzled out.
            Some people even think in 1984 Orwell implies in the glossary of terms that Oceania eventually collapsed, based on his past-tense verbiage in the section on Newspeak and the fact that he fought very hard to include that glossary in the book even when it would have been more lucrative for him to remove it.
            I couldn’t fucking agree more, it’s a game so just give an option for the happy ending then everybody happy. 

Jesus it’s like TLOU2 all over again, these stupid writer/ developer centered stories need to change, make it a truly open ending game, rather than pretending to be one. 

In my opinion the story of this game is heavily underdeveloped, like every time I enter a new area a stranger would call me then suddenly we are buddies doing jobs, no introduction, no context what so ever. It almost feel like they hired different writers to write stories for each character then magically taped them together through robotic phone introductions
    If you felt hopeless then the writers did their job.  Cyberpunk dystopia is about mankind's futile fight against technological encroachment and the loss of our souls.  I think a lot of people are forgetting this.  Everyone is going to get what they want (an unchecked life in Night City as a merc) with the first DLC I would be willing to bet a million dollars on it.
        Thing is that the game was heavily promoted as allowing you to make your own decisions. Instead the player repeatedly loses control at decisive junctions in the game and is forced on a railroad experience with no way out.

Dystopia is one thing, but taking away control by the way of cutscenes or outright forbidding certain actions, is a very lame story telling vehicle.
            > taking away control

That's sort of the point of the cyberpunk genre. No one has any control over their lives. Taking control away from V and by extension us is a major theme within the genre. Even though V gets to choose who to go with his fate has already been sealed. Everything was out of his control.
                That would be ok in a book, but not in a first person open world game. If everything was out of anyone's control then people like Saburo Arasaka or Morgan Blackhand would not exist.
            “ Thing is that the game was heavily promoted as allowing you to make your own decisions. Instead the player repeatedly loses control at decisive junctions”


Getting to make decisions doesn’t mean you win. Just like in real life. Sometimes you do all the right things and still fail.
            There will never be a game like the one you are describing. Never. It's not even about technology like it was back in the day when people expected cutscene level graphics in game. There just simply isn't enough time to make a game like this where every single choice has an impact. The amount of man hours in writing alone would be insane. There are games that come close but none of them have a blank canvas MC to play as. They all have a character that has clear goals and intentions that you kind of tweak a little or go along with as you play.
            Wait so let me get this straight.

You want to be told a story, but you also want to write the story yourself with unlimited potential paths?

Might want to check your logic choom
                Unlimited paths? I would be happy if one of the 7 endings was not doom and gloom.

Learn to read choom
    I'm hoping they end up tying all the endings to the Crystal Palace in different ways, and somehow V finds a cure during the Palace events. The only thing they would technically have to de-canonize would be the let Johnny take over style branches of the endings. The other options would all be quite compatible with each other.
        What's the crystal palace?  Am I dumb or is this something from the Cy2020 tabletop game or something?
            It's an in-game private space station for the unimaginably uber-rich. In the Path of Glory ending V undertakes a job to infiltrate and steal from the Crystal Palace in exchange for an unexplained "promise" from a new character who is implied to be very powerful.
            It's a luxury resort of sorts on a space station.
    Wanted to see the Jefferson guy more- the whole brain control sidequest.  I wanted to see that quest out to completion and take out the people who were controlling the future mayor.  The call at the end kind of implies he like dies or goes crazy.
Anyone with the Panam ending figure out how to get the three legendary items in the chest next to the basilisk? Takes you to the credits and you don't get to keep them... A coat pants and boots, not sure what they are there for
    No, that pissed me off so bad.
        Right, finally a cool legendary trench coat. Too good to be true I guess
            I am curious if it is glitched, I assumed they would be the items you get rewarded, but I didn't seem to get shit after "resetting back".
                That's what I assume
                Same, I think they mean special weapons you can pick up in certain endings. I got rogues pistol and it carried over.
            I got one off placid
    It's probably for the DLC. Look at the stuff, it looks like cowboy shit that you'd wear in Arizona in a Cyberpunk universe. 

Keep that in mind and do what you will with it :)
        >Anyone with the Panam ending figure out how to get the three legendary items in the chest next to the basilisk? Takes you to the credits and you don't get to keep them... A coat pants and boots

this is actually a good theory if it happens ill come back to this
    Meanwhile, I got to keep the fucking legendary shovel I looted...
Did CDPR not learn anything from Bethesda? Anyone remember how a good amount of players were so unhappy with how Fallout 3 ended(which by the way, the ending in Cyberpunk really reminds me of), that they created a DLC just to correct that?

Maybe they had already planned that when they made Broken Steel, but sure seems to not letting the player continue to play after the main storyline is done is almost always a less popular move.

They did that with Witcher 3. Why does it feel like CDPR is just throwing away all the good relations they've developed with their fanbase in the matter of a few weeks?
    Ahaha looking at the endings for the first time I really did go "I wonder if CDPR is gonna wind up Broken Steel-ing this with DLC". Reminded me a bit of the Mass Effect 3 ending debacle, but less hopeless.
Just finished the panam choice, THIS is what a wanted, a happier ending. And Judy insinuated she wanted to marry you or something. Much better. In the Rogue Choice V was still doing the same old heists in the end, and alone. In the Panam choice V is free, from Johnny and Night City, and has a family and a lover. Hope its canon, but I have a feeling V going after the Crystal Palace is Canon.
      I hope they end up tying all the endings to the Crystal Palace in different ways, making them all canon like with life paths, no matter how you start (nomad, corpo or street kid) they end up the same.
        Maybe nomad contacts have located some rare tech or genius up there that can help.  Bam aldecados going to space.  Hell what if an ending there means they get to be space nomads.  Hopping planet to planet.
Did no one get the suicide as their ending?? Holy shit that pissed me off and just left me in pieces. I legit had to sit there and hear V pull the trigger. So frustrating. Then again reading all these other endings is just making it worse. No option to let V live? Really? I guess I was lulled into a state of comfort due to DLCs being a thing.
    The suicide ending was fucking INTENSE. The voice logs afterwards are horrifying, especially if you romanced Judy.
Cyberpunk is a subgenre of neo-noir. So, as corny and overused this Martin quote is nowadays: "if you thought this had a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention."

For all the game's faults, I felt the main story was done pretty well. Some endings are also more hopeful than others, as it was already pointed out.
Idk what happened, did I solo attack a space station and die in a blaze of glory?
    [deleted]
    Well the job was to steal the database of the casino
    The job was to steal the client data off the station not just blow it up. Up to your imagination if V got away with it or not.
    If you chose to go back to earth you have 6 Months to live you make it back to earth
    I feel confident that the blaze of glory happened. True Rocker Boy fashion
All the repetitive testing at the end in the space station made me want to through my controller. I couldn't skip quick enough. Should have just died lol.
    Think that's the point, V ends up smashing everything if you want in game.  It was 6:00 AM when I finished looking at all the endings, probably 4:00 AM when I finished the space station one.  I literally couldn't sleep quick enough.
        Dude I was playing on an all night bender when the devil tarot appears... Scared the ever loving shit out of me.
Are there ANY endings where I get to just chill with bf River for the last months? That is legit what I would do. Seems like everybody went with Judy or Panam, so I can’t get a straight (pun not intended) answer.

My V has had such a spicy past few years and deserves to kick back with someone she loves.
    Yeah, my V let Johnny take over, but decided to go back to her own body on earth. I got a scene with River since I romanced him, where he seemed concerned about V’s mental state.
        So the only people who get to enjoy their time with V are Judy and Panam?

I hate when the game designs a preferential LI
            No.

If you romance River, and then take the Panam route for ending, River joins you and the nomads out in the open road (90% sure this is the case). 

So you gotta finish the Panam story (obv not romancing her), so the Nomads helping you is a thing for ending.
                I heard that this happens with Judy but not River—which checks out with the fact that he’s prioritizing his family now

I’d love if that was the reality tho
                    That's a shame, but i can also see why he doesn't join.

To me it seems like Female V with Judy going with Nomads is the best ending for all chars involved (well not all chars, but ones you do quest with)

River has his sister and nephews to take care off
Panam has her family now, Judy on the other hand lost pretty much everything and wants to leave Night City anyway.
                        My ideal ending wouldn’t involve leaving Night City, tbf. I’d want to stay right there and spend the time with him and his family, over chasing a pipe dream in the middle of fucking nowhere.
I really hope DLC expands on the ending. I really hated all 4 of the endings I saw, and it felt kinda cheap that if you do the romance quest for Panam it opens up an entire ending but if you do the Judy romance option you get to say goodbye to her before you agree to accept the deal from Arasaka. This game has such a strong buildup and fizzled out for me in the end.
    U can take Judy with u, if u do the panama ending
    I could be wrong but I think you can bring Judy with you in the Panam ending as long as you did Panams quest but I agree with you on the endings.
        You can, but that's more of a "Hey, I'm here too!" sort of thing. By hooking up with Panam, you get an entire extra ending option. By hooking up with Judy, you get a "bye-bye now!" call to her and then you get forced to side with Arasaka or do the Johnny ending. Total missed opportunity IMO.
            Actually u can take a romanced Judy with you, in the panam ending, just make sure u do both.
            I was really looking forward to doing the Panam route UNTIL I find out that Kerry legit breaks up with Male V if you go that route. The relationship legit was the shortest out of ALL the relationships in the game.  I feel like the Nomad ending or/and the Heist ending should be considered canon since both give you a sense of hope that you may find a cure.  I forced myself to do the Rogue (heist) ending due to that being the only ending you actually get to be with your love interest (if you go for Kerry or River).  It also adds a bit of mystery to who the mysterious man with blue eyes is and what he has planned if V was to succeed in his Heist.  We will see early next year if we are lucky!
the ending where you get your soul digitalized didn't even really explain what would happen to you after
    [deleted]
        Lol I feel like im stuck there right now. I don't know what I'd do without the internet. I'm blown away by the fact being stuck in "cyber limbo" is supposed to be the bad ending. It feels like so much of science fiction is fear of what's next and new. I was really hoping for something like Ghost in the Shell's or Neuromancer's forward thinking strangeness, that Alt's solution should have been a bridge to the new, instead of just highlighting what's human. I thought Cyberpunk was about what's beyond human.
            What's more transhumanism than cheating death? I don't see why people are viewing Mikoshi as something bad.
                Copies are copies. You are dead but you created a virtual copy of yourself that thinks it is alive. A real shame to the poor child
                    This. A copy may have all the original properties but it’s still not the original. So even if he was copied to an engram and it didn’t still end with V dying after a few months, he was dead the minute he was killed by the soul killer and *copied*.
                        That's the thing though we still haven't define what consciousness really is, if it is simply the neurons firing in our brains then, a 1 to 1 copy of that is by definition your consciousness, if an engram simply scans the brain and converts it into an AI then it complicates the problem even more because we don't even know what a conscious AI look like let alone how it works.
                            Even if you would consider engram a conscious it would still be a duplicate.
                                that the whole point of my argument, since we do not know the nature of consciousness we cant say that a copy isn't you. you cannot make claims about dying if we don't know what happens to your consciousness after you die. if a teleporter deconstructs your body in the atomic level what says that the reconstructed version is still you, we do not know the nature of consciousness in our universe, until it is defined then you cannot claim otherwise. if engram V remembers how he or she became an engram then what makes her a duplicate?
                                    In my view it’s not about if the engram is the actual person or not. It’s all about instances for example you can create an instance of a new process on a computer ok now let’s go further and spawn the exact same process again it’s not the same instance. Now if we were to kill the original instance you would be left with a copy that is not the original instance but exactly the same in every regard. My point is the original instance is dead regardless of the perfect copy still running. I hope I clarified my point.
                Having played Cyberpunk, the framing.

Unless you mean conceptually, if you ask people if the human lifespan should be increased, they'll likely say no, having accepted that death is a part of "life" despite technology also being part of it.
                They call it soul killer because it's doing exactly what it's named after.

You can't just transfer what makes you "you" into the digital realm. That's not how consciousness works.

The engram would be you for all intents and purposes, and act like you would, change like you would, but when you go in you die. The copy of you is "born", and has a discrete life from that point on.

That's why some would prescribe those machines as evil. If employed en masse, they would commit genocides to create an army of engrams, all corporate property of Arasaka. "don't worry, the law will catch up and recognize engrams as people" was very disconcerting.
            [deleted]
                You don't get stuck in Mikoshi, that's not what Hellman says. Arasaka has a service for extremely rich clients who want to be immortal via body-hoping, it's called Secure Your Soul. That's what the contract is. You'll be in Mikoshi until they find a compatible body to give you. Then you'll live again. 

On the other hand joining Alt beyond the Blackwall does mean you'll be there "forever". Which is technically not really dying, since your mind will keep existing there, but you're also gone from the physical world for all intents and purposes.
                    [deleted]
                        Getting a new body because yours can't be saved is why they're offering the contract in the first place though. And I'm pretty sure the offer is free, you didn't pay for removing the biochip or the weeks of treatment either, and they don't mention a price with the contract either. 

You make an agreement that they stop you from dying in exchange for helping them retake control from the traitor son. You did your part and it seems like they're doing theirs. They let you leave no questions asked if you don't sign, makes no sense to only betray you if you sign and be cool with you if you don't.
                            [deleted]
                                I agree it's left vague af, just seems to me like the whole point of that ending is that you live in exchange for giving up the fight and all. Like in the opposite ending where you attack them, you're fighting the megacorp and become a legend, but you die. It's more narratively and thematically fitting if the ending where you surrender yourself to them actually saves your life, but at the cost of everything else. Ideals vs life.
                                    [deleted]
    We haven't really been given any in-game reason to believe the "self", "soul", "ghost", etc actually transfered. 

The person living in the body of Johny is dead. The construct we have is a copy. We were even told Arasaka kept multiple copies of himself.

This ending is just a more complicated suicide. And then a copy of you gets to have a small chance of living your life in your place. 

That's horrfying to me, possibly the worst ending along with Johny taking over your brain completely
When I played Witcher 3, I made some choices that didn't seem bad at the time, and I can argue aren't indicative of shitty parenting or whatever, but that made it impossible for me to beat the game.

See, the ending I got wasn't an \*actual\* ending, it was a Game Over. The worst Game Over I ever experienced. And since I had done so much in the world before ending the game, I would have had to sacrifice a \*shitload\* of game time to go back and actually win.

I was burned.

So this time I decided to spoil the ending so I wouldn't get burned again, only all the endings are so shitty that no matter what I do I get burned. I love CDPR. I love ice cream. But this is like a fat nugget of dog shit sitting in my ice cream.
Sadly the player character dying in the end has become standard in modern gaming. Writers are literally allergic to happy endings. I think this came from years of people complaining happy endings were too boring, so now its usually pretty dark or at most bittersweet.
    Good endings don’t need to be naively happy, but just pumping out downer endings because they’re a trend is just cynical and lazy.
The Panam ending is by far the best imo. The others just didnt feel right to me. I feel that both V and Johnny got a good ending in the Panam ending. My V became close with Johnny and made him a better person. He went with Alt without a fuss and V left with Panam, with hope in their hearts that they'll beat those 6 or so months V has left.
When I first launched the game, I stubbornly decided to play as a corporate till the bitter end... Wasnt the finest choice, with the tears in my eyes I watched my character abandoning all his friends and making a last call to Panam... The feeling of loneliness struck me so hard I did burst into tears. And I didnt like signing "becoming a property of Arasaka" stuff a lot.  
But when I replayed the events with the nomad ending, I was full of tears again, because I understood that value of those 6 months is much higher than an uncertain opportunity to live further. Was catching every moment I could get with Panam and other nomads, because they felt so alive, so true...  
That was the point of the game for me, I\`ve learned a lot as a person, if you do first corpo storyline with a developed romance, you understand what I mean.

I am a transhumanist myself, but the real expierience of losing everything for technical immortality did really question my ideals... Hope I wont be making a choice like that in my life, because it would gonna hurt a lot.
    Yeah. I got the ending and damn! Conflicts with your morals enough to make you consider your ideals? Now that's an ending!
    F* that, ethernal shitty life all the way, screw that void and disappearing from existence.
did they ever really explain why V still hears jonny? is that because of the DNA damage? i am a unsatisfied with the endings
    Probably just dreams, every time you hear him you hallucinate stepping off into space and wake up.
    Which ending does he still hear johnny in? Only done the Panam ending so far but they wre completely severed during that one
        on the space station between the trials
            [deleted]
                > a more fleshe

But if you join the "Save your Soul Program", don't you technically live on forever? With the slim possibility of being brought back in the future.
                    [deleted]
                        also don't forget... what if Arasaka never solves the body rejection issue?  Or if you get new leadership at Arasaka that believes you are too much of a loose end to revive?  Going into Mikoshi is one of the darkest potential endings imo.
I really think there should  have been atleast one ending where V lives. Making all the endings so sad and open ended is going a bit too far. Maybe V loses his body but keeps his mind or loses all his fame and money and has to stay on the run with Panama or something.  This would also make us choose if we want to live as a nobody or die as a somebody.

The endings made me not want to play it anymore.
    Same man. That was sad :/
I cried... My wife held me
    Same my first ending leaves me feeling empty
I did 2, and left my sit both times with a gut-punch feeling I mean in all best scenarios V gets a short life-span and since I went with Juddy, she leaves, leaving me feeling empty and alone. Didn't need more of that in my life.
    If u complete panam's questline you can take Judy with u and leave the city together with panam's nomads
        I completed judy and panams questlines. but i chose for the rogue ending, when Judy called V an asshole it hurt. Gonna try again with that panam one
The way I think about it, the first achievement being called the Fool already foreshadows all the endings. Actions have consequences. V thought he could get away with all the consequences of him trying to become a legend in NC and is consequently on borrowed time due to his own foolish actions. (And it’s about the same with Johnny) So what length will he go to and what more consequences will he have other people suffer to get his life back? Is he willing to forsake everything else for his life, or maybe after all of this he would realize that there is something higher than his life without which life is not worth living?

Edit: Well I just collected all tarots and Misty said clearly that V and Johnny are the fool so I was right on that one at least.
    The thing about that for me is, the game is all "oh you can't have everything, you have to die to be a legend, blaze of glory or quiet, etc", and I'm just there like "Ok but I don't care though. Dying in a blaze of glory is still dying". Being 'just' the top merc in the city is fine by me tbh. I even told both Panam and Judy that I'd probably leave with them after I get my whole dying problem. 

"Everything I want" is living and being a top merc. I'm already the top merc (with max street cred and all) before the point of no return. So if I also get to survive (legit survive, not that 6 months bs) then I do get everything I want. Suck it you punk ass tarot symbology.
        In the line of work of a merc that dichotomy isn’t false but rather wishful because between the other outcomes 99% of the time are much worse. How many times have you reloaded before getting to street cred lvl 50? On every gig you can die and get dumped in a junkyard and forgotten.
            I mean, if I stay alive through the Arasaka deal, then I'm not going out, and I'm not exactly living quiet, cause I'm a famous merc. The theme is totes bullshit.

I didn't reload that much, but it's an RPG, saving before doing anything risky or taking important choices is how most people I know plays that kind of game.
            To be fair, once I found a shotgun with 4 mod slots it was all easy from there on.  If I really tried hard not to die to dumb shit like falling off buildings or walking on land mines I'm sure I'd manage a no deaths / no saves run.  You can get something ridiculous with the double barrel shotguns or the carnage by putting 4 crafted crunch mods on it.  Shotguns are unique in that regard because they shoot multiple pellets, all of which receive the damage bonus.  Kind of broken tbh, made the smasher fight incredibly easy.  Start one shotting everything.
    Yep. There's a point at which you rendevouz with Viktor right before Hellman drives you to the Arasaka manor, and you can ask him about the boxing match he's watching. He says it's a re-run, and V asks if the loser of the match ever gets up. Viktor says no, he never does, but that's to be expected bc he picked a fight with a better opponent. 

V *is* that losing boxer who picked a fight with a bigger boxer/Arasaka and so, in most outcomes, loses/dies. Had V never gone through with the heist, he wouldn't have to get in the ring with death itself.
        I think this would have a lot more substance if not for the fact that there is an ending where V soloes the entire Arisaka tower and destabilizes the corporation such that they can openly come to power as the new king/queen/legend of Night City.
            Lol true
    What I didn't like is that was the only real direction you could go in throughout the story. Hopefully they carry the story on in the near future 👍
    So many people are missing this point!  You nailed it.  He literally has a cautionary tale living inside his head for 90% of the game and he never realizes it until the end.
        I think people are rightfully annoyed that they could see this coming from 100 miles away (most notably Jackie himself on the same trajectory dying tragically) and there's nothing they can do to avert this despite it being an interactive medium. Compounding this is the fact that V is not a pre-established character but is supposed to be a vessel for the player, yet the player gets railroaded into this one "Legend" motivation for V that they may not share.
Yea most of the endings are really sad. Really didn't help my depression ahahaha, but that I find is what makes it so damn powerful. Though I'm quietly hoping there would be a FO3 Broken Steel like possibility in the future where we can continue with a certain ending
I got the arasaka ending and was destroyed when I heard Hanako forgot about V already I was loving that girl. So I just assume that after a while they find V a body and she guards Hanako as an engram until they fall in love and take over arasaka
    I could easily imagine V becoming the next Adam Smasher. That ending feels like it was meant to be a subversion of Johnny, but it stopped short and decided on trying to make you sad for thinking you could trust Goro's plan?
        Yea bc I gave up on everyone else to gamble on the corpo ending so its really lonely bc there's only a few people you can call and hanako doesn't answer. I guess it's supposed to be a punishment for betraying everyone in a sense but I would love to see a dlc where V wakes up in a new body like in Altered Carbon, but in this, she gets the girl.
        What do you think would've happened if this was a 60 hour campaign? Do you think that could've been a turning point where V becomes adam smasher pt 2 and follows a new quest line for arasaka? On a side note, my one disappointment with the corpo life path is that you still feel like an outsider to corpos. With Meredith it isn't noticeable but when talking to maiko I think we're way out of our league and that doesn't really make much sense to me. Also I kind of wish V was japanese in that one so that she fit in with arasakas, but I realize that's a lot to wish for
I just feel so empty after completing all the endings.
I think it would be already a sad and bitter-sweet ending for me to say goodbye to Johnny and Rogue.
But this is kinda to much...
Like I get it, it's a dystopia. Yet now it just seems so pointless to do any more unfinished quests and exploring. 
I with the game at least let you live your last 6 month and still do something.
I thought that doing the endings the way they did was the best compromise between being true to a dystopian story AND allowing you to continue exploring the open world.  In this type of fiction the endings are grim on purpose.  You have to question humanity, choice, sacrifice... all very heavy subjects in this genre of fiction.  Giving you an ending where everything works out and you get to go back to work in Night City as the top dawg with Panam at your side would be the biggest slap in the face to this fiction genre ever.  

I think when the DLC begin to drop you'll probably get a new protagonist some time after V's demise that heard of his/her legends and wants to follow in those footsteps etc... and that will be the vehicle they use to give you an unchecked life in the game world.
    yeah I get your first paragraph. If they wanted to take that angle, then they shouldn't have made so dang many happy ending side stories. half the people you meet are good, capable people who act to make the world a better place. Have your cake and eat it too.
None of the endings are very satisfying and to be honest they don’t really make me want to play the game again. I get that the Panam ending is meant to be open-ended with a note of hope, but by the game’s own rules up to that point, every hope V has to turn the situation around is denied to them and every tantalizing hint of a solution gets snuffed out soon after. So it’s hard for me to think that the game intends for V to find a solution to the condition they’re suffering from.

I feel like all of it is a bit cynical and to all the people who say “it’s cyberpunk, it can’t have a good ending” and so on, honestly? Pick up some actual cyberpunk literature. The genre isn’t about nihilistic, fatalistic bs. To the contrary it’s about ordinary people, living in a futuristic, noir, morally ambiguous world, and how they deal with the shit cards they’re dealt, and not just surviving but sometimes even thriving. It’s not nihilistic, it’s just not utopian and naive.

These endings just sour the experience.
    Amen, brother. I love dark storytelling, but these endings just aren't satisfying in any way. Shit, if anything I understand Johnny's old mentality of burning the city down now. Was really hoping for an ending where we take down Arasaka, set our sights on Militech, and find a way to keep Johnny in our head but stop it from overwriting our psyche. Was it really so hard to give us an impactful ending? Why does V have to end the way he started, a loser.
        Same feelings here. If V (or Johnny) has to go out it should be with a bang that makes an impact (I was promised a burning city or at least Arasaka). Overall the endings lacked that extra oomph, the beginning and the middle of the game were much much stronger. The main story wrapped up too quickly. 

In terms of going out with a bang the space casino ending is the closest but even then without Johnny being present it feels very bittersweet (and it's just a cut scene ...for now?). You spend the entire game chasing the cure and then in the end Alt says 'no sorry actually just realized I can't help ya'. And her solution feels like an even worse Mikoshi. Another place where the loser is gonna be trapped forever but this time impossible to come back from. 

To me the relationship with Johnny was the absolute heart of the story. It really seemed like you have two main characters in the game and you get to develop them both as their fates become more and more intertwined. I'm actually surprised a lot of people seem to dislike him. I loved how rough and no bullshit (and hilarious) their interactions were. Really matched the harshness of the world. And how it could turn into a genuine friendship where both sides really developed. So I'm crushed you don't get to preserve that friendship, especially if you focus on it instead of the romantic options. 

Having to choose between one character or the other really doesn't make me want to go back because now you have this cloud hanging over you since you know what's coming.
    These endings feel rushed and poorly thought out with a definite lack of AB testing with end users to gauge reactions.   There is no way for the player, who has been told his decisions and interactions matter through over 100 hours of gameplay, to make any choices at the end other than to watch everything they worked for be flushed out to a set of binary trash choices that include all the relationships they built up to be annihilated without input.  

Case in point, why the fuck make me go through all this shit with Rogue as Johnny, where choices allow you to go down a path that demonstrates Rogue has always loved Johnny and now Johnny has learned his lessons and is a reformed man ready to reciprocate; only for her to be blown away with no recourse.  I could see if you made a set of choices that were sub optimal or demonstrated that you were still the asshole Johnny then she would bite the dust but the fact there is no way to affect any of that is poor usage of the story elements and game decision making engine. 

Tag on the weird nonsense post game credit scenes that are easily catchable from a player perspective.  There is some serious Mass Effect 3 shitfuckery going on here and it makes me not want to play the game again.  Compare that to Witcher 3 or even Mass Effect 2 and you can see how there is a serious dropping of the ball here.  The entire gameplay experience is as you say "soured" and leaves me the player with a lack of desire to go back and experience all this again.
        Mass Effect 2 was such a perfect “ensemble” game, where the amount of effort you put into caring about your team mates actually decided the ending you got, and it was super rewarding. Same goes for your decisions as Geralt in TW3 and how your parental influence on Ciri and choices with Yennefer and Triss really impacted the endings and ultimate fates of those characters as well. This is sorely lacking in CP2077, sadly. The questlines for characters like Rogue, Judy, and Panam are overall very short, and it just doesn’t feel like the relationships are earned? Similarly, the endings just feel punishing and yeah, they make the rest of the story feel futile and unsatisfying.

Sad endings can be effective when well done. John Marston’s end in RDR1 felt tragic, but fitting, for example. But this... it’s just rushed and it feels like they didn’t have enough time to wrap up the story nicely after so many re-works to put all the focus on Johnny so they’d have more Keanu, and so the endings, like the lifepaths and so many other things, feel tacked-on and badly designed.
Those endings make me don’t want finish the game. I think I won’t do the last main mission. I didn’t mean those endings are bad. It’s just... make me feel depressed.

I will just do all side quests until DLC come out.
    Honestly beat thing to do, or do the Paman ending 👍
        And I don’t think anything will change after we do the ending. For me, it’s no point to finish it.
    Side content is where the best content in the game is imo
I really enjoyed the ending where V joins Alt and Johnny takes over the body

...At least until the credits.

I really wish Johnny had the presence of mind to say goodbye to all of V's friends rather than just ghosting everyone. Plus I thought it was really weird that he just gave up on his vendetta against Arasaka. Half the reason I left him the body was because I trusted him to find ways to fuck with them and get people wanting revolution again.

Overall I liked that ending a lot though. Just would've liked it as much as the Panam ending if the credits weren't everyone trying to reach out to you in tears because they don't know what happened to you. Especially the call from (romanced) Judy, that fucking floored me. I think her phone call in this ending was even sadder than the suicide ending.
    I really liked the change of heart in johnnys personality i mean He got his revenge on smasher and He know that from the inside arasaka is doomed due to the family conflict
    One of my favorite parts of the story is Johnny Silverhand’s redemption of sorts... This ending is definitely my favorite. V gets to go out as a legend, Johnny gets another shot at life. They’ll never fade away.

But HOLY SHIT why did they have Johnny ghost all of V’s friends? Unless I’m reading into that ending wrong, it just doesn’t make much sense. The credits scenes sap all of the sweetness out of such a bittersweet ending.
Am I the only one that really appreciated V and Johnny building up a solid friendship over the course of the game, with an unfortunate but stoic ending where V understands he can’t live and let’s Johnny live on. Johnny felt changed in this ending, like a part of V went onward with him.

I liked how different it felt. At first I was brutally sad, but I found it so fulfilling to see two selfish, rather lost souls pull each other up to a point where their selfishness and personal goals were triumphed by their will to improve the lives of NC citizens.

This end has Johnny say Arasaka isn’t as powerful as they let on, and this means they can’t start another war with Militech.

I liked this ending and find it canon in my head. It carries the most meaning, it demonstrates a transcendent will I really felt uplifted by. This isn’t a story about V, about Johnny - it’s a story about innocent people getting eaten alive by the city and this ending takes a step in ending that.
    Dakota says it in the Aldecado ending: you’re a bird who was dying from freezing and you try to live in an engine to get away. You’ve been dead the whole time. 

In my mind the best ending is Don’t Fear the Reaper + giving Johnny the body as you’re recognizing that you already have died and trying to hold onto life means you’re killing Johnny. Instead, have both live on in their own way.
does anyone know if there's a way to get the grav boots you get in the final mission post ending?
**V IS ALIVE AND HERE I TRY TO EXPLAIN WHY!!!**

Many of us have hoped for different endings, although most of these show us the death of V this is not entirely probable starting with one of the favorites for the community which is Panam, this leaves us with the hope of That V finds a cure but it does not guarantee us that in those 6 months they will get it, now the second ending '' Good '' which would be to trust arasaka also opens the possibility that V lives and can resurrect in another body, but being arasaka No It would be everyone's trustworthy but perhaps if they end up helping us to return in the future, for the third party the least hopeful ending but that leaves us incognito is to become a legend by storming the space station casino that would be our '' final work '' but of the same way, after completing the robbery, we could have met someone to help us and so V lives, how can I tell that V is alive? the answer is YES, being one of those 3 endings that V comments if he is alive and will return for future expansions.
    Bruh, V dies in all of those endings. You either die and have an engram made out of you or you die and have an engram made out of you that becomes arasaka property. The only real ending where the 'original' V lives is if they decide to go back to earth to live out the rest of their life.
I went with the Panam help/Johnny keeps the body ending my first time. It didn’t seem right to go back to a body that would die when Johnny had the chance to live. That one hit me hard. Then I went back to the opposite and have V keep the body and it felt off to me. At least for how I played V. I also went back and did the suicide route and Afterlife/V route. Hated how V was acting in the Afterlife one. She just... what? Forgot where she came from? Ignores her friends? I feel like after all she went through she’d maybe just... rely on her friends who got her through and work with them to find a cure. As for the suicide route. Instant regret. The video calls after we’re ROUGH.


Also, I romanced River and I definitely felt he was brushed under the rug in all of this. He breaks up with you in the Panam ending, is fighting with you in the Afterlife ending (because that V is apparently a jerk), doesn’t even seem upset in the suicide ending... like... what was the point even?
Personally, I chose to let Johnny take over because I got too attached to him and wanted him to have a good ending.
    Really the closest thing to a good ending is "Johnny gets a second chance" I mean you can give Johnny a new lease on life or the next "happiest" ending is let V's love interest watch him essentially die from cancer over the next 6 months and pretend those would be happy times.

            Definitely, that's my biggest issue with that ending entirely. I mean hell, most of them already know about the condition to begin with, how hard is it to give them some closure.
Honestly I actually enjoy the ending, its a dystopian future so our standards of "happy ending" doesn't really apply all to well. Mikoshi (arasaka data bank of engrams or "souls") in essence is the point in which humanity transcends death, people calling the Arasaka ending the bad, denoted by the devil tarot card but I honestly think in the standards of cyberpunk universe its a big win for the main character. New technology is always limited and access to it is often reserved for the privilege few if you watched altered carbon it has potential for more than just immortality, it could be the seed that grows humanity to become a space fairing race. it is easier to transport someone in a biochip or a data bank than living bodies due to the long periods of time it takes to travel long distances in space but when a soul is in Mikoshi time becomes subjective, 5 years could feel like 5 seconds similar to how when we dream sometimes what feels like 5 minutes is actually an entire night.

I still feel that the ending is an open ended question, how long is V to stay in Mikoshi, will she play an important role in the future in a DLC or something, like Hanako might spun her back up in a new body for a job or something seeing as her engram is different in a way, or if V went with the route of going back to earth with 6 months to live in those 6 months a new medical company could have released a treatment to fix the alterations to her DNA. seems plausible enough for a DLC. 

It sucks that we cannot return to the world after we finish the quest but story wise I quite like how the endings went.
    100% agree. I'm really surprised by all the people mad that there wasn't a 'good ending.' The world in the game is fucking depressing, why would you expect a good ending? The story is fascinating, it actually made me think about it afterwards, which is the first time a game made me do. And I fully agree with you - the V staying in Mikoshi is the most likely cannon ending because there's a lot of opportunities for where it could lead afterwards. Maybe Arasakas find a reason to bring him back for something? Not ruling out the Panam ending being canon though, that would give them an option of doing the same they did for blood & wine DLC for Witcher - new location
        Yea it's true, after I chose to sign the contract honestly ngl my first impressions is wow that is underwhelming but afterwards it does make you think which is pretty rare in games, most of the time after finishing a game you pretty much get over it instantly but this game makes you think even after finishing it.
            ppl are pissed, because it left a really bitter taste afterwards even if it makes you think. Noone wants to invest 50 hours into a game to get fucked in the end
                Well it's a dystopia it's no different than watching my favourite tv show and at the end of 30 episode my favourite character gets killed off. It is supposed to be depressing, hell if they added an ending that is by our standard "happy" kinda breaks the immersion of the whole fucked up world the cyberpunk universe is. A good story is one that makes the reader think the meaning behind it themselves and not spoonfed in a silver platter. 

Not saying you are wrong, I was pissed when I found out v dies in every single situation that is why I say the arasaka ending is the best one it gives V a second chance.
                    I like the idea of it, but from the presentation it feels pretty clear the writers intended for it to be a bad ending.

It could have been a more cyberpunk ending if a transcendence ending happened more like the Ghost in the Shell movie. Like instead of just Johnny or just V, there's a synthesis. There was a lot of foreshadowing for synthesis but it just never happened.

IMO a real good, bad ending, could have been V becoming the next Adam Smasher, a full chrome corpo hitman. A complete subversion of what Johnny was fighting against. You become the oppressor.
                        The game has a theme of ideals being bigger than just living, and the Arasaka contract is presented like giving up your ideals to live. Even though you can roleplay through dialogue that this isn't what V wants. Jackie talked about wanting to be a Legend, with a drink named after him. I never did. I don't care. 

Even becoming an Arasaka enforcer in exchange for living wouldn't necessarily be that bad. Takemura was an alright dude. Smasher is an asshole but he was always like that, being a cyborg or a corpo didn't change him.
        I'm more of a the outcome sucks with a silver lining kinda guy. A series called shin megami tensei does this pretty well. The mainline games all have depressing ending but there are silver linings to them. The ending isn't completely bad, but it isn't completely good either. Not just completely bad.

In Shin megami tensei 4, the player only has one "good" ending and eventually the same things that happened in the game will happen again because it simply delayed the inevitable and humanity rebuilds itself only for the same thing to happen again at a time far later in history.

In the bad endings, you have law. Where you essentially cleanse all with free will and create a kingdom ruled by angels. Everyone is very happy, however they have no free will and are incapable of sinning. However because you were exposed to those with free will you were cleansed as well. And the cycle ends.

In the chaos ending you let demons wreak havoc on humanity. And it creates a world where everyone is free to do as they please. There is no fear of a tyrant ruling over them or ever taking power, because if that happens someone can come and dethrone them because might equals right in this world. And the cycle ends.

In the nihilism ending, you activate a perpetual reactor that releases all life in the universe from gods design. And there is no war, pain, hunger, or anything negative. This is because there is nothing at all left in the universe. The reactor created a black hole that erases everything from the universe. Ending the cycle once more. However in the manga, it's explained the protagonist grew to regret their actions and created realities in which he didn't exist to see what would happen.

All of these endings are pretty fucked, but they each have a silver lining and they tend to be pretty honest as long as you understand picking sides in SMT Is taking the selected ideology to the extreme because there's no other choice and it's the factions best chance at winning.

Give me a Cyberpunk ending and I'll give you a version that'd give you the SMT feeling. In SMT the endings give you a sense of satisfaction but with the knowledge of knowing you did some fucked up shit to get there and even then it's not a panacea to all your problems.
        Personally I'm not mad that the endings aren't happy, I'm annoyed that the one I picked (which I don't even consider bad anyway) just ends abruptly and doesn't give me details. It's left vague to seem deep probably but I'm just annoyed and disappointed.
    For me it was more about if you do sign the contract, all the people you knew and had connections with are the one that got fucked over too. A friend, a lover, a brother, w/e type of connections you made with your various NPCs like Judy, Panam, River, etc. 

For all intents and purposes, it seems like you just "disappeared". Now that is fucked. So if your character romanced someone, well guess they won't be getting any sort of happy conclusion with them.
        Sure there's that, but you 100% die if you don't sign. So the choice is either don't lose the connections you have, have them for 6 months, then die. Or lose them now, maybe get them back later, and if not, get new ones eventually.
\[Crystal Palace End\] What did V do at the Crystal Palace? It was the end I had and the only one I didn't understand well.
    he's trying to steal a data bank or something.


the weird faces it shows him making as he's floating towards the palace looked like he had no oxygen or something though.
        As I understood it he basically went on a suicide mission to go out on his own terms, just like Rogue, hence the grin.
I feel like the Panam ending is the best one. Left me feeling hopeful. Plus with fem V and Judy making it out together makes me feel good too. That being said, I've only played the panam ending, read about the others.
    Bingo. Just the prospect of hope is what makes Panam's ending the happy one. Objectively the Illusive Man knockoff in the Path of Glory ending is probably a better path to getting some kind of treatment or cure, but in that ending V has basically totally given up on life and is just seeking more and more insane jobs to cement their legendary status. The entire portrayal of corporations in the game makes me extremely skeptical of any claims that Arisaka makes about finding you a new body, particularly when it's implied in the Path of Glroy ending that the "Save your Soul" program was not as advertised anyway (Plus going by Johnny and others' reactions trusting Arisaka is clearly the bad ending) Whereas in the Panam ending V at least expresses optimism and *hope* that they may find a way out of this once they get out of Night City.
Endings were a big letdown. The game itself was absolutely fantastic, but the "you die no matter what" perspective makes me just feel empty.

Wanted to play 2nd walkthrough asap before I reached the ending but now I don't really want to, because I know it will be for naught.

&#x200B;

There is a huge thread with 300 pages in the official forums if you feel like discussing this further.
    2nd playthrough idea is what I was thinking about as well, at least for all the happier parts of the game but the endings just... not worth replaying just to have that throw into your face again that V will die. Sucks...

I went with the Nomad ending with Panam but man, even that ending is basically 'V, you are screwed no matter what, but, hey, at least your love and friends are there with ya, well, for 6 months anyway'.
[removed]
    As much as I wish that DLC/Expansion expands upon an ending to let you get some...more closure or golden ending or w/e people prefer to call it.

This is more likely, which is...unfortunate. The ending I got was bittersweet...but...more bitter then sweet. Great, Judy joined me with the Nomads...now she's stuck with them or all by herself after 6 months, way to go V!
    Thats one way they could go but again it just feels like a waste/pointless like V says at the end. Dlc wont feel impactful if we already know the outcome
    I think DLC happens after V has died and is now considered a legend in Night City personally.  My bet is on them making the Casino Heist ending canon.  We'll see if I'm right.
        Well ok but that would mean we have to start from scratch? Would be rather annoying.
            Not necessarily.  You could start at V's level that you ended in game.  There is lots of ways you could do it if you're CD Projekt Red.
Many players complain that the game does not have a good ending, in which everyone would survive and everyone would be happy. But such an ending would spoil the game, because it would deprive the player of the most important thing that people have to do in real life - the need to choose and sacrifice. Otherwise, most players would choose a comfortable, but illusory "path of least resistance" ending, after which you would sleep peacefully and you would not take anything out of the game. All the endings are beautiful and multifaceted in their own way, they are as devastating as life itself, but I want to clarify each one separately:

V accepts Arasaka's offer. **Tragic ending**. V was never able to evolve as a personality and betrayed himself for the sake of a faint hope of existence in the distant future.

V leaves Night City with Panam. **Ending with hope**. From other endings, it becomes clear that there is no cure for V. Even Alt and Arasaka - the most advanced units - cannot help. Already during a conversation with Panam, V coughs up blood, which makes us understand that he will face the same wilting as in the Arasaka clinic, slow and painful. But unlike the ending with Arasaka, he will die surrounded by people who love him.

V commits suicide. Classic **Game\_Over** ending. Nobody, of course, ends the game on it.

V gives his body to Johnny. **Canonical ending**. The only ending in the game that shows the complete revolution of the personality of both protagonists. V accomplishes a feat, sacrifices himself for the sake of a friend, and himself becomes a free spirit in the endless expanses of the network. V frees himself from illusions and gives Johnny a chance to completely change, rectify mistakes, a chance that Johnny never had. This makes Johnny go through a complete reevaluation. He is no longer interested in fighting against corporations, he leaves Night City and begins a new, real life, keeping the bright memory of his friend.

Vee becomes a Night City legend. **Tragic Ending 2**. In this ending, V essentially becomes the new Johnny Silverhand, ending up killing himself in an illusory war against corporations.
I’m stuck right now between the rogue ending , which I have a available or loading up the save I did prior to the point of no return and completing the rogue missions, I just want something to be expanded on
I just hope they are gonna make a dlc out of Panam's ending
Just finished the game.... I haven't felt this empty after finishing a game since the Witcher 3.

I chose the "sign the Arasaka contract" ending, which I personally think is not a bad choice, since ***if*** it wasn't all just a trick, gives you the ability to live forever more or less. I also never really felt angry towards Arasaka unlike Johnny.

I mean Jackie died because he got hurt after falling through a glass roof, not because of Arasaka. So not their fault. Not only that but they stole the engram in the first place, so they weren't exactly the good guys either.

And I mean wasn't V's goal from the very beginning to survive no matter what? Isn't the soul saving program exactly that? But I mean all in all, there is no truly "good" ending anyway.
Bruuuh... just finished the game and have tears in my eyes. Since the start I’ve always wanted Johnny to get a chance to live again. It was just natural to me to give him V’s body to continue his life. But boy, it made me emotional 🥺
This shit was worse than Mass Effect 3.  I went with Rogue.  Depressing as fuck all the way through.
    Yup, just finished with that line and i dont think ive been this angry since Mass Effect 3.   Literally every choice you make is bad and to watch all that effort at trying to reconnect with Rogue only to be blown away like it was nothing....its just too much.  Reading all the other endings and post credit shit makes me even more angry.  Honestly, this is Mass Effect 3 level rage inducing.
I just want a good ending ngl.

Bring it as patch or whatever idc.

I just want V to survive and delete Johnny from his/her mind. So we can play after the ending.

But that will not be happen sadly.. I think they missed a huge opportunity here.

This Reminds me of Mass Effect 3 Ending. Its an easy way to end the game for devs. And a lazy one.
The fact that there is no way to actually resolve V's condition aside from "Arasaka Contract" is so stupid.

Even more stupid is that your gender or lifepath plays absolutely no role in the making of the ending.
I'm all for dark stories, berserk is one of my favorite stories so far. But the endings of this game? Fuck. They're all so dark & depressing, you're literally better off not finishing the game. If Berserk's ending is as futile and meaningless as any of this game's multiple endings, I'm going to seriously question the entertainment media I get hyped about in the future. Lol
There was theming of accepting death sprinkled throughout the game but honestly I was disappointed. The story would be good in a book or movie but I don't like these kinds of stories for a game. I would have really preferred it if there had been a way to get a happy ending for V. I did all the side quests and sunk almost 130hrs into this game, and it felt like none of the endings are rewarding for that. 

I am just left feeling extremely unsatisfied.
Since ACT 2 I went all the way through the ending like 30 hours finding a way to make my V survive. Then finally they forced me to choose whether V dies immediately or 6 months later. All those endings made me feel what I've struggled was useless, empty. I feel like the one who made this plot was obssessed with the idea "Cyberpunk genre must be dark, grim, sad, uncomfortable which should end with death of main character", What the..

 I read some people say that it gives you a message "Death is inevitable"(aside from mikoshi ending), but in this case I think it's more correctly "Death sentense is inevitable" 

I don't want "happy ending" like V becomes immortal, destroys megacorp and saves the world. I just want endings more acceptable where my efforts during more than half of my playtime doesn't feel useless. It is RPG game and has a great main story so I am deeply attached to my V, I just hope they care player's attachment a bit more than their 'noble ideal' 

Sorry for my english.
    Agreed 100%. You would think that our progress and choices during the game would heavily impact our endings, but yet, here we are.
Reading through the comments and seeing people looking at the hopeful ending as the true cannon ending is interesting.  The Cyberpunk genre is all about surviving in the worst future outcome of humans.  Most of the time, the hero fails in the Cyberpunk genre, or they become the very thing they set out to destroy.  Cyberpunk is a genre where hope is gone, and dying is the real freedom.  (and for those who don't know; when I say Cyberpunk I don't mean this game specifically, I mean any work of fiction that has corporations running everything, modified humans, cyberspace is a place you can visit by uploading yourself to the net, and generally the world is not a place you want to live in.)
    Nah, the cyberpunk genre isn’t like that at all. I guess you never read stuff like Snow Crash, Neuromancer, or When Gravity Fails? All classics, all stories where the protagonists survive. They may not be 100% “happy” endings, but they’re not downers.
        Thank you for actually giving sources. The game could have had a satisfying ending and still be in the Cyberpunk genre. They just wanted to be cliche with dark shit and lazily end the game quickly.
Yeah, I had the ending where you became the new Afterlife legend, sucked that I had to leave Panam but at least the story ends the relationship on good terms with hope for the future... but I hated how I couldn’t continue to play as V, the guy on top of Night City.
    The game was giving you hints that this would happen the entire way.  Even Dexter Deshawn in the first act was like "Do you want to live a quiet life or go out in a Blaze of Glory?"  If V had chosen a quiet life there would be no game.  He was never going to make it out.
        That's a pretty bad false dichotomy though. Lots of people die quietly and there's no good reason you couldn't live in a blaze of glory.
            Considering blaze of glory means you die swinging, how would one live in a blaze of glory? That doesn't make sense.
                I mean like, if your life is being the top edgerunner it might not be as spectacular as soloing a private army and blowing a top secret basé but it's not exactly a quiet life either.
I chose the Panam ending. I'm currently watching the other endings on youtube, and I'll definitely choose different ones for my next playthrough, but the Panam one seemed to fit best with my Street Kid. started out on the streets, lost his good friend Jackie, and being able to live the next 6 months of his life with a woman who finally cared for him, outside of Night City, is just poetic to me.
Yeah I feel pretty empty as well, I've done all the endings and the Panam one is the best and most hopeful. I like to think she finds a cure with those six months, some kind of DNA therapy or mind transfer into a robot body? Don't know but either way I feel this big sense of loss.
I think the ending with Panam where you leave the city is the best. Especially if you’re a female V and you romance Judy. Because at that point, Judy leaves night city with you. It made me happy and filled me with hope. As someone else had commented, it does seem logical that it’s unlikely to find someone to really help V, outside of the technologically advanced night city. But I’ll say this: it’s just one city. One city that ultimately has nothing but loose ends. Arasaka may be like gods. But they’ve got no reason to further help V save his/her life. Loose ends. V choosing to expand his/her horizons, ultimately opens the door for even more possibilities. Nomads or not, there’s bound to be someone out there that can help V. So with this, I think it leads to V finding a way to survive. Not every story is meant to have a happy ending. Whether you like it or not, it is what it is. And regardless of what ending you choose. CDPR chose to let the consumer make it their own reality.
I struggled but ultimately decided I wanted to end things on my own terms as V and chose the Panam route, though I was terrified for her safety the whole way. Throughout the whole story I always interpreted that everything V did was a hail Mary. It seemed to me that the game was telling me that everything you do was to just get a chance at survival. Because of that I was sad but very okay with the 6 month to live timeline at the end. I personally felt that as the game progressed the idea of being a legend mattered less and it became more about trying live longer and be happy. I liked the idea of riding with the nomads and living out my final days happy and beside Panam. Like I said  I felt we were told that it was longshot from the start, at least this way V's life can end in peace. I felt that this ending fit what I'd imagine a happy ending from this genre would have.
I personally think that the Panam Path is actually a pretty nice ending. The 6-month thing is a real bummer. But if I recall correctly, didn't Alt use Soulkiller on V the second you plugged yourself into Mikoshi? In my mind this means that when V returned into his/her body, he did so into the (now empty) engram chip of Johnny, as his old soul had been killed(aka the personality in the brain). So even if there isn't a cure for Vs Body, Vs mind is preserved as an engram and could be revived. At least thats how i like to look at this :-)
I really feel like the Arasaka contract ending is the only one where you get to live.

If you finished "fool on the hill" quest, Misty tells you that even though the "devil" tarot seems bad, it also stands for survival.

Other than that - I like the nomad ending.

Regardless, I'll have to replay to save my homie Takemura.
yo i just finished the game and i am so sad
Honestly the whole game and especially the endings hit close to home for me. I lost my sister to a brain tumour this year and the situation with V and Johnny just reminded me of that a lot. I played with the hopes of maybe succeeding in what I couldn't do irl, saving V from his/her fate, but couldn't even really do that. It made me really sad honestly, but that's maybe because it hits close to home for me
Don’t forget you technically already died in act 1 when Dexter Deshawn shot you, and Johnny has been dead for decades. It’s all borrowed time, I don’t mind a true death at the end but I’d rather the game let you use your second chance for something more meaningful. I guess releasing all the AI’s in mikoshi and really fucking up Arasaka is sort of that

Side note, I bought the Caliburn and legit felt like I “made it” haha
unpopular opinion: i think the bad ending is the best ending as it keeps the hopeless vibe of “no surviving Night City” or “there are no happy endings for people like us” and it truly affirms that Night City is the worst place to live in as NO ONE gets a happy ending, which was the vibe that CDPR was trying to go for in my opinion.
    But that’s what pisses me off so much about the story. No matter what, all endings seem to indicate v was fucked from the moment he stepped foot in Night City. The fact that most of us who got to the end of the game and expect DLC to finish telling us how the story ends is lazy storytelling.
Did the rougue ending and let johnny take the body. To me it was a no brainer( 6 months of slowly dying of what is essentially brain cancer or vs letting your friend have a full life and a second chance).

I was full on sobbing by the epilogue and the voice calls during the credits fucking HURT. 

Looked up afterwards what i did wrong to get the bad ending, but after reading the others, to me it IS the "GOOD ending".

I feel emotionally wrecked and empty after finishing it. It wasn't a bittersweet ending, it was just straight depressing. 

Really not the motivation and headspace i need to be in right now; Not to sound dramatic, but the endings got me genuinely really fucked up.  

Wish there was an ending that wasnt bleak (no i dont think the panam one ends well either).

Overall, it was a good story, just one i could have done without at this point in my life.
It’s a shame that every ending leads to your end (death of char and/or just cannot play any longer). I was looking forward to continuing on but this right here will cause me to drop the game and move on to another and not look back. All that time and effort for what? Seems like a lot of wasted effort. Looks like it’s back to Genshin Impact...
Did the Panama ending, at the end of the game i was pumpen to replay the game. But after the ending, it felt like all i had done to to find way to cure V was for nothing. Felt empty.
With so many endings and not a singel on was "happy".  So many choices in the game, so much freedom. And the last one and biggest choice is all the same what you pick. Last time i felt like this after completing a game was Mass effect 3. Ending ruined the replay value for me.
I almost enjoyed the night city legend ending... but man the shit Judy said in it crushed my soul. The endings all really made me feel hopeless tbh I wanted at least a little bit of damn happiness. I was really hoping going into the end that there was a way to just stay merged and stop the spread so Johnny and V can both live
Honestly I went with the ending of dying on Earth (because imo living on infinitely as an AI is a fate worse than death) and all it left me with was just "that's it? really?"

&#x200B;

Maybe I just think that way though because shit moved too fast to actually care about anything in the main quest chain, I much preferred Infinite Warfare's story despite that being shorter overall because the pacing wasn't out of wack

    >the arasaka soul well

I wouldn't call that a good ending since it feels to me like they are trying to bullshit you. Compatibility issues? Didn't stop johnny to take over your body too so why is that suddenly an issue for them? Signing away all rights as well? I doubt V sees another day in his life
        Well it looks like if you aren't compatible the process changes your DNA and you will die.
        I think the arasaka soul was the probably the best outcome for him to live on. I doubt they tried to bullshit ya cause takemura (you can save him from the apartment) Really seems convincing and promises he will find another body and that when he gets another one takemura promises to take him around Japan.
    I doubt thats when V is the happiest. It seems like Nomads is the happiest, bc if you romanced someone, they come with you instead of you being alone staying at the afterlife for 6 months and dying.
    There wasn't just one story arc though. As someone that started Nomad and got the Panam ending (and I romanced her), it felt too perfect for it not to be canon ending.


But I bet rogue's ending would fit better with a streetkid. I havent played it, but I'm guessing the ''I want to be a legend'' bit will be more played out there, since in the nomad path the game focus a lot on how V's lonely and how worse it got with Jackies death. So in one he becauses a legend by planning an heist on a spacestation, while the other he finds a family. Plus, Johnny ends up together with Alt in cyberspace which in a way, is also pretty cool.


I have no idea how the corpo arc would flesh out though lol
Started with a nomad, ended as a nomad. Panams storyline was great and so was the ending. Hopefully they make a dlc exploring this ending deeper.

Also what’s the song in the credits
    Never Fade Away (Samurai Cover)
After reading everything I will not finish the story until I see some better dlc options..seems pointless to even continue in free roam... guess its back to GTA. They are getting that big expansion tomorrow anyways.
[deleted]
    I think around 6 endings tbh.
I had no relationship with Johnny yet the game assumed I would like his character. I didn't. 
I could called panam but not judy even though I did three more quests involving Judy, seems odd, just becuase I don't romance her? I feel like there was more friendship there.
The choice of being uploaded wasn't much of a choice at all. A file of your consciousness is a child of you rather than you, so you would be dead either way.
It didn't seem like the quests actually had a timer to them but becuase games like Deus ex do I did the main story a bit to fast. I would've liked if the side quests spawned faster so that I had more time to do them.
Game total was short too, but all that accumulated into the ending I got, him going back to earth, and NOT being able to play as him after, a bit lame to say the least, especially with everyone saying I had betrayed them and having these battles about what's wrong or right after I ran over like 20 people for the sake of a Dio meme.
Any way, wish I could've joined malstrom and became a crazy killer guy. Much more satisfying
I like the space station ending and am curious to see what they do with the DLC i hope it’s a DLC that shows what happens after the ending i think this one is canon , I kinda get the feeling we’ll see Mr Blue Eyes again tbh wish i could’ve spent more time with River tho he’s a cool love interest as well
i wish there was a \*merge\* ending
Yea I agree the endings are very empty I did like panams the best but it still felt empty
[removed]
    This happens as panams love interest too. She says i dont think il make it back to camp tonight, tough being the chief and it sucks they havent seen each other as much but she’ll make it up to him, then she says bye sand storm is coming. 

So i guess they r still together but she goes out for work or something since shes the chief. Mitchs msg also comes up so it makes no sense
the panam one is the only good one and even then its still not even "good" its "theres a chance but its still basically death"
Yeah, I mean I felt the same way. I wanted a way to be able to save both V and Silverhand, even if that meant they kept sharing the same body. Its not entirely the ending they wanted, to be able to both live, but they could take solace in being able to be there for one another in some way. Even if it maybe costed them their LI down the line for not being able to handle that. I enjoyed V and Johnny's relationship the most so, that was priority for me. 

Otherwise, yeah I mean i don't really know which ending I 'like' perse because they're all bleak and don't see much resolution. The way they set it up, feels like a one shot in V's story. Its hard to see what they'll do for a dlc.
I felt that way too. I picked the Panam ending for my playthrough just because it felt right, and afterward wondered how I'd missed the "good" ending, only to find out that WAS the good ending. I guess the whole thing is a "pick your poison" style finale. One way or another, you're handing massive power to someone with suggestedly nefarious motivations, and there's no way Johnny and V both get good endings. They don't even get clean deaths which I could've lived with for Johnny or even V if they accepted it.

The "6 months to live" thing in particular felt like salt in the wound for its own sake. Like was it really necessary that the MC be doomed from the start with no way to avert it?

They're all downers one way or another, even the Aldecaro route. I really didn't like it.

Kinda left me feeling like the RDR2 ending, which I guess lots of people liked but I thought was incredibly stupid and unsatisfying. I just feel kinda drained and sad.
I feel like they could have pulled off the Johnny taking V's body ending if they made more of a push to morph the two psyches.  It seems like they tried.  They hammer the point that Johnny will influence your decisions and change you, and Johnny does noticeably change by the end, but they still feel like two distinct psyches when it's all said and done.  If they could have pulled that off, they could have had Johnny carry on with V's life post ending and have it be no different, because their psyches would have already morphed into a "bad-ass V/less shitty Johnny" hybrid, with the memories and experience from both.
I only played the "secret ending" so far and it left me so sad it was gut wrenching to see V lose like that after everything. I'll try the Nomad ending since that is where he came from and Panam is there. Hope they make a DLC where he/she has a chance to fix all this. V's really grown on me.
I wasn't sure what to do in the ending, and accentually made choices that ended with >!me ending my own life and V's as well by shooting myself in the head.!< This wasn't intentional, and the text just said something about >!throwing the pill away.!< I wasn't ready for things to go this way and they really didn't make it clear that was the choice I was making.

Did anyone else end up with this ending and were unclear how they got there?
Spoilers of course but I don’t know how to censor them so forgive me:

Why does V have 6 months to live? There should plenty of ways to prolong his life in a new or altered body, especially since theres that side mission with Lizzy Wizzy where she explains how they created a fully chrome body for her on a live performance, even if it isn’t preferable couldn’t that be a solution to V’s problem after the main storyline? He already has seen how thats possible first hand
I went with the Arasaka ending because it seemed logical as I started as a Corpo. Johhny hated that though but he broke his promise of not interfering with me after I completed his "last" requests so I couldn't really give any shits about him at that point. I also chose to go back to Earth instead of soul prison so a DLC could expand on finding a "miracle" cure if they really want to continue with V as a protagonist.

I read about the rest of the endings but they are all similarly underwhelming for V if he won't give his body away but at least in the Nomad one they mention about knowing someone who can save him which is something at least.

But yeah overall I am not satisfied with the endings, they are just reskins and the lack of choice and variety is awful. Going through all that shit to just die in the end, ugh. I probably won't even replay this and will only touch it next time if there is an expansion.
Exactly my problem..all endings were so depressing
Just played through two of the ending (Thanks, CDPR for the save point) and both were unsatisfying of endings.   I get it they want to end V's life, but not providing an ending where you can live pass the 6 month just seems fucked up
I think the story works better as a tragedy. Either take the “L” and kill Vincent/Valerie and Johnny via suicide. Or give Johnny the body. Either way since V dies in this story six months after regaining their body, there is no point in trying to return in my opinion.
I love the story, it was deep, emotional no black&white trash straight out fantastic written until the end. It doesn't matter which ending people chose its well written across the board. You decisions matter and were meaningful every time. (In terms of story decisions, could be better in sidequests but yeah thats another thing..)

CDPR actually said the game is complete and so V's story. So my thoughts are whenever a dlc will be available it will build around another character and another story in NC.

But thats just my 2 cents.
ngl guys I think grim endings are just sad and lazy.

I know you peeps, love to pretend "grim ending is good because cyberpunk dystopia bla bla bla" but it's just easy and disappointing.

Overall the game is a solid 85/100, got 120 hours out of it so I got my money's worth, but gosh the ending do be kinda shit doe.

Definitely won't be buying any DLC except if it pertains to the ending. I got the Crystal palace one btw, shooting up Arasaka with my full legendary level 50 Character (Assault-Cool build) was cathartic as hell. Best sequence in this game and in all games I've played recently, period. Fuck these cunts.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Mine was a 100% walkthrough. All quests, all gigs, all NCPD stuff. Everything. I even read all the shards
The direction of the narrative was misleading imo. Youre straight up dumped with a feeling of meaningless and no satisfaction. 

A: die
B: leave city and die 
C: stay and die 
D: die whilst Johnny lives
E: become an engram whilst Saburo lives on and never know if you were tricked or not. 
 
Everything is pretty futile and only left with the feeling that you're a memory. Your impact on the city is also pretty meaningless since you only crippled Arasaka until they eventually rebuild themselves. Feels kind of rushed at the end. 

I get its a dystopian setting or that you're told you're doomed from the start, but the game felt like its supposed to be so much more and just makes me think how much of this actual ending is finished lol.
As annoyed as I am with the rewards of the endings (seriously, gorilla arms, a shotgun diagram, and a berserk mod, most of which I already had?), I am not annoyed with the ending I chose, the Solo ending. Johnny and I actually connected, and I saw him more as a partner and less as a cancer, and no ending highlights this more. Johnny's "remember; you're better than they are" and the arasaka troopers shouting in fear of the Solo V got me hyped up as all hell. Then choosing to let V return to his body, leaving him to honor johnny's memory out of guilt for a promise made in a hotel room now broken. My V would sacrifice anything to carry on the fight johnny started. He'll live out johnny's last words to the day he dies. Philosophically speaking, I'd rather be a human for 6 months than shredded data for eternity.
I wasn't very fond of the endings tbh. Mostly because it didn't feel like there was any of the endings that accomplished anything for the Johnny and V. No matter the option, V is gone. The closest thing we get is him/her being an engram, meaing a copy of a dead person just like Johnny. I don't think there should always be a happy ending of course, but there has to be some silver lining. Comparing to Red Dead Redeption 1 and 2 for example, there was always a clear goal to save your family and in the end you accomplish that even though your character doesn't make it. So it still feels bittersweet. Problem is the Cyberpunk endings just feel kinda bitter. There is no option to survive for V, but his/her death doesn't accomplish anything either because the entire goal through the story was to save yourself, which you fail at. The only ending where V's passing makes a difference to other people is the Johnny endings, but even in those even Johnny himself doesn't seems satisfied and apologizes at V's grave for failing him/her. And Johnny himself is just a copy as well, not even a real person, so letting him live in V's body with no friends or family stuck 50 years in the future doesn't seem satisfying either. IMO you shouldn't have to come to terms with BOTH V dying as well as his/her copy only having 6 months to live, both those issues at the same time just makes it too bitter for me.
I got sun ending on my first playthrough and tbh I found it to be satisfying for a lot of reasons :

-> Johnny had a redemption arc, V gave him control of his body and Johnny went out with a bang. Fixed mistakes of his past and then left with Alt to be reunited with her in the cyberspace

-> My V stayed with Kerry and honestly, sun ending is the best for Kerry romance. If you go with Nomad’s you break up with Kerry and Kerry message both in suicide and Arasaka endings are just... fucking depressing. So I think sun ending is the best one for Kerry romance

-> He became a legend in night city

-> The „Mr. Blue Eyes deal” we don’t know what happened. We don’t know mb Blue Eyes had a way to help V survive after big Heist and the casino job

-> Misty did a tarot card where she read how V had : Strength, Emperor and I think the World and she said she was happy with this result and she sees bright future ahead of V

-> Plus I think the sun ending fits corpo V a lot (reaching the top and all that).

So I think the „Sun” ending was pretty satisfying for me (even though it seemed bittersweet)

The Nomad/Star ending is good but it also comes at the price of sacrificing even more lives (comparing to sun where only Rogue dies). I think this ending suits V if he was with Panam (or Judy in case of female V).

The Arasaka ending I found to be bad, the whole thing just screams that V got used by Arasaka. He basically managed to save them a lot of trouble and even after all this Hanako completely ignores/forgets about him. It’s left pretty open (Like Sun and Star ending) but I think it’s one of the worst ones

The Temperance ending... eh, I think it isn’t terrible but like I said. I think Johnny accepted that he would die, he fulfilled his goal, he managed to defeat smasher, he met with old friends, he did what he wanted so I say let him stay with Alt and allow V to keep fighting (I think he even says that to V if you allow him to go with Alt). Cause there’s gotta be a way to save V life even with the time limit

The suicide ending naturally... I think it’s the worst one and the messages you get from others are pretty depressing
I tried not to put any spoilers in my thoughts and ideas but it still has something that you could see as spoilers.










- [ ] I have some guesses for DLC‘s but it’s probably going to be the paid ones when is going to involve AI probably a war between the corpse and the free AI‘s in control over the Internet. Also I’m hoping for corporate missions where you can actually work for the corpse or at least be contracted to do certain gigs for them. I have a feeling if they’re going to make a DLC that supposed to go after the main game in The nomad ending probably in The state that you go to you are going to have to take down a Corporation or side with another group in which you will be dealing with cloning because technically that’s the only way that the main character will be able to survive more than the time that was given. I think there will also be a small DLC where are you doing missions for Malorian either finding a lot of the guns that this person made and just putting it into your collection or they could make it bigger and you’re actually working for the guy who made Johnny’s gun and working with the CEO to make his guns not a Boutique firearms developer anymore so taking submissions to find some of his source guns and their designs and may be stealing them from other corporations or even better than that just finding the guns so he can look at them again. Because Johnny’s gun is extremely special and how it was created because it was crafted in space so there would be no impurities in the titanium build of the firearm
My best guest is the arasaka ending is canon as any other ending just leads up to you surviving and entering another body, possibly. Yourengram, just like Yoronobu who takes over his son’s body will eventually happen later down the timeline. That is my best guest but I can be wrong.
I chose the "Let Johnny take over my body" ending. In my headcanon, V leaves with Alt and in due time, as an AI, she'll find a way to come back and possibly get a new body or something. In this ending, both Johnny and V are alive in a way. One thing I didn't like is that Johnny didn't call Judy and the others to tell them what happened, where I ended up, etc. That would've been a nice touch. I would've wanted to put Judy's mind at ease that I'm still "alive" somewhere and that I might return one day.

The other "good" ending is the Panam ending, but judging by what Alt said about the autoimmune disease, the outlook doesn't look good for me in a dying body.

All in all, these two endings leave a sliver of hope in my mind, that perhaps V will return one way or another.

I don't know enough about the other endings to comment, but none of them really appeal to me.
The Endings are hopefully not final, I think it is set up in a way where they can easily make a dlc where you can find a cure or something, at least in my eyes it makes sense cause in nearly every ending you have the 6 months to live which leaves plenty of room for dlcs.
It's even sadder if you realize that protagonist dies earlier in so-called "good" ending. The game tricks player to think that protagonist is still alive when playing after re-inserting engram into it's body. But the sad truth is that he's dead from the moment Soulkiller created that engram. Alt clearly states that in one of her dialogs, but protagonist just can't (or refuses) to understand this. It's really stunning how elaborated the main story is- it's playing with your mind in the most delightful way.
Thats a good way toi think about it, maybe down the line they will do a DLC following on from the ending. I doubt it but would be cool
    I think they probably will create a DLC to explore this ending. Seeing as the other endings did not really have a way to continue on without massive changes other than the ending in which Johnny Silverhand keeps the body. Since keeping Keanu Reeves on a payroll would probably leave them broke pretty fast, I don't think they'll go down that route. CDPR really spent a lot on this game, I think they'll want to keep the main character alive, despite him not being as iconic as, say, Geralt or Shepard.

Edit: Plus the Panam ending just feels more polished and more thought through as if somebody put more effort into it. Can't hide bias, whatever will later be used should logically get more attention. My gut is almost never wrong about these.
        > Plus the Panam ending just feels more polished and more thought through

Which is weird considering triggering it is kinda random in a way as a StreetKid. Johnny and Rogue are part of your path more frequently and more organically than Panam, who you only meet once and never again (unless you go out of your way to do her side quests)... 

However, Panam offers a more satisfying ending. Before tonight I was set at going the Rogue/Johnny way, but now that I know about how open and optimistic Panam’s ending are, I’ll just change route and call the Nomads. Still feel weird and unnatural, but at least I will get something somewhat satisfying out of it.
            > (unless you go out of your way to do her side quests)...

If you don't - you should not get the option of this ending, that would make no sense.
                I mean, I get that, but my point is that in order to get a somewhat hopeful ending you have to abandon the main organic narrative and do *her* sidequest, despite the fact you barely hear/see her again after her branch in the main story.
                    All the "character-arc" sidequests are like that. For Judy, River, Panam.. hell, even the one for Johnny. Or the one for Jackie's funeral.  It is a question of friendship - if you consider that character someone worthwhile, a friend - you take time to do them. For me it was pretty organic, especially considering Panam as romance option.
                    That’s one way to view it. But you could also say that Johnny and Rogue represent the trap of Night City, they’re legends in their own right and you can become one too... but look at the cost they paid. And Jackie paid. And every street kid pays pursuing that goal. 

Choosing the Nomads IS a bit random, because it’s you breaking that cycle. Potentially for the better.
            Very late to the party, but to me I thought the most thematically appropriate ending was Johnny leading a new raid of Arisaka tower, only this time he's not doing it to destroy or to fulfill some ill-defined grab for glory, but to save V (and for my headcanon nomad V, it was also appropriate that possibly their final act would be to put their complete faith in another to save their life). And I thought that mission was awesome! Looking forward to replaying the game with Male V so I can romance Panam and get my "happy" ending, if we want to call it that.
                I understand what you're saying but i disagree with your assetment of the game's theme. This wasnt Johnny's story, it was V's. Leaving the soul sucking corporate Night City for the road with Panam feels more like canon.
                    Depends on how you view the story - Is it a redemption arc in which V learns it's not about where you end up, but the people you love (Nomad ending)? Or is it a rags to riches story where V finally, and at a great cost, becomes the greatest merc in all of night city?
                        Yeah, it depends. The rags to riches is pushed heavily. The whole reason was to become the king of Night City. 

After it sucks you up and spits you out though, I like the redemption/nomad arc.
                            
Interesting - I tried both endings as of yesterday and I strongly feel the rags to riches ending felt better. I barely wanted to finish the nomad ending for my street kid V who wanted to be a legend. I think it purely depends on what WE want for our Vs!
                    We are in agreement, I was referring specifically to the quest itself.
            You can totally make it work for a streetkid I think, it's what I did and I just saw it as my V was sick of the city and the pain it's brought and was enjoying living the nomad life on his jobs with Panam so decided fuck it, nomad life let's go
                Makes sense cuz in the beginning the street kid went to Atlanta hoping it was better than NC. After being burned by the city life, it’d make sense to go nomad.
            wanna give my opinion on your post to just make you feel a bit more comfortable with choosing panam... If we take references from films and series, 

altered carbon takeshi started somewhat "corpo" being in the army and ended up with a group of rebels.

oblivion, jack harper started from "corpo" but ended up rebel.

Luke skywalker, scrapper/tinkerer.

Elisium almost has that same ending feel where they gang up to take down the big shots.

some more but I dont wanna think anymore and you get  the idea. Nomads are the nearest we can get to rebels in the game (with the exception of silverhand and his chooms. that was 50 years ago)
        [deleted]
            I don't think Kerry gets ghosted? If you are in a relationship with Kerry and choose the nomad ending, Kerry shows up to the camp in a taxi shortly before you leave and breaks up with you. Now that was a gut punch for me. All those people you got killed by asking the nomads for help, and your boyfriend doesn't even leave with you.
                Kerry has a real life and a career outside of you. River has his family. It makes sense that neither of them drop their whole everything to come on your escape, just like it makes sense for Judy to quit Night City and leave with you.

I don't see how it's a stab at the Aldecaldos that neither Kerry or River come with you; they're not the nomad's family. You are.
                    Never said it was a stab at the Aldecaldos, I said it was a gut punch to me, because I'd grown to like Kerry and his relationship with V during my playthrough, I was sad that I had to leave him behind.
                    Which is why the female V with Judy in the Panam ending is the best to me - it gets the most good people out of NC and happy.
                I'm so pissed about this ending. It doesn't feel like the good ending everyone said it was. Your boyfriend leaves you and you get a bunch of good people killed, all so you can live 6 months more. Honestly wtf? I was somehow happy with the game despite the bugs but this has left a bad taste in my mouth I can't shake. I even felt a strong emotional/ friendship connection to Panam, but still. Ugh.

Edit: extra words
        Could as easily explore the arasaka ending though. The one where you can sign a contract. Maybe they find a way to give v a new body. Seeing as this is one of the default endings it's way more likely to be explored in the future.
            There would be no Johnny Silverhand then, which would be a bummer. The main character, V, was not really that Iconic or memorable. Johnny Silverhand compensated for that. Without Silverhand, I think the game would lose its cool factor. That's why I initially thought Arasaka ending would not be explored. Also, whether you choose Mikoshi or Earth is important. They cant possibly explore both, it's vastly different. Nomad ending only has one option and that is to leave Night City. If you give the body to Johnny, he also leaves Night City, which, in my mind, indicates that they want to explore other cities or states maybe due to the creative freedom it will provide. Night City is well-defined but other cities or states are less so.
        What about blue eyes man? That ending has too many unknowns and sometimes frightens me. I doubt V is alone to kill all the corpo owners and rich people.
    I just enjoy cruising through Night City, collecting things, doing random events that seem to infinitely pop up from time to time, I am basically living in Night City.
        Lmao tell me about it, have so much fun just roaming around, running off a laptop with a 2080 maxq atm so can't wait for my pc parts to play it at a decent frame rate, what are you rocking hardware wise?
            Love to see that people are actually enjoying the story and this game. This sub feels so toxic to be on. Feels like there is no place to be enthausiastic about this game. This game really gripped me for it's storytelling and people you meet, but so many people wanted so much different things from this game. Everyone had their idea of cyberpunk in their head before the game launched, but there is only one version of it. Without bugs and some fixing of AI perhaps this game should be ready for a lot of good story DLC. Hope to see the pan am ending expanded as she is one of the characters and stories I ended up caring for the most. Best written of the characters and side quests IMO. Was really happy to find out there was a somewhat happy ending for her.

I also really loved it. Especially during credits when Misty mentioned that she did tarot and that V's got a great life ahead. This girl definitely knows more than we do... :)
    Can I just say I love Misty, like not in a romantic way, as she was with Jackie, but like a great woman who would give you a hug if you needed one in a hard time, she really is so sweet, and pure.
        Totally agree with you, she's always there to comfort and support you. Great character.
        Totally misty reminds me of Mayuri from steins gate tbh
    That part was the icing on the cake for that ending. I tried the Rogue ending before I went with Panam, because I was scared of her dying, but the ending choices for that one made me so mad I almost decided to stop playing for good. I went back and did the one with her and I'm loving the game again
 🔥
        Yeah I felt a similar way going with the rogue one, I didn't go with Panam because I felt like I didn't want to risk her life, or the nomads. I might do that my next PT because I'm mad that I also left Takemura behind, and I didn't know you could go back for him. The guy was one of my favorite characters too. 

I also don't mind sad endings, I mean I loved RDR2's, its a gem. But what i got felt like there was no resolution, and in fact my character's life worsened in quality with River.
            Little late but 100% agreed. I legit didn't know you could go back for Takemura. An optional objective didn't show up so I thought he was gone. Only found out a little bit later after looking up some of the missions online. Really made me sad since, like you said, he was one of my favorites too. If there's at least one thing CDPR did right, it's the fuckin characters. I honestly think I can say I like pretty much every single one of them.
                the characters were nice. I think River needed more to his questlines, but hes still likeable. I didn't think I'd like everyone as much as I did, so I agree. The story line itself is good too. Only wished for some finer details in some areas, but hopefully if they do a dlc it will expand on the characters we got attached to.
                    Yeah River was my first romance of the bunch, figured I'd do separate playthroughs with the others later. He's honestly pretty cool, and I'd argue his side job quest line was both quite disturbing and also very well done. Probably one of my favorites. Panam's questline was definitely quite fun too, and the first time I got to test run the Basilisk, I got pretty hype lol. Sadly, I didn't finish up all of Judy's before I beat the game, but I'll probably just go back before the endgame sequence and wait out a day to finish. She seems pretty cool too.

That's definitely something I hope they do as well: flesh out the romance options/characters more. Gonna be a while before we get DLC though, I imagine. I'm okay with that.
                        I thought there'd be a little more to River's questlines, they were well done. I agree, but by doing two things with him he calls about missing V, which i don't think is fully justified since they barely know eachother, where as Panam and Judy do have longer sequences before the romance scenes. I do like the dynamic between the cop angle and a law breaking merc. I wish they played with that a little more. 

It would be cool to have new romances as well, given i guess some can break it off with you depending on what ending you go with. It'll be interesting how they tie everything together.
                I did the Panam ending and on the end credit scene, Takemura San told me to go to hell. I saved him and all. Anyone got this too?
        Do sad endings make you not like the story?
            Garbage endings make me not like the story. 🤷‍♂️  Especially in games where post story dlc could be easily doable.  Fallout 3 was probably the only game that fixed their ending with dlc.
                Sad endings aren't necessarily garbage though. The first ending I tried was the suicide one and... it's probably the worst but it was quite powerful and well made. Its message might seem quite obvious but it's one that is always good to remember: suicide is not difficult for the one committing it... it's hard for the ones left behind and that have to keep on living (which is paradoxical because V choses this end because it's the "least bloody"... except he/she didn't factor in the pain and despair).
I really hope the Panam ending is canon. I hope when they go to Arizona it starts off in a new game, not a DLC. I, hoping that V gets a cure and can live out his life, to me Panam is such a great character and i would love to see something continued off Panam and V where V gets a cure and lives happily ever after with Panam and his Nomad friends.
    I played through all of the endings, and the one with Panam was by far the best, and the one that just feels right with the story. Going off of Mistys card readings in the credits I feel like it will work out for V.
        I played through all the endings too, i noticed that when Misty was reading the cards to you, the only good one was with Panam and every other ending besides Panam's was a bad card reading. I think Panam's ending is canon, just feels like they've done more work into her ending then another. I really hope that Panam's ending is canon.
            I feel the same. It definitely should be the canon ending considering the others were just hollow in comparison.
                Yeah all the other endings just felt depressing, but Panam's ending actually felt good, it gave me hope about V's survival. But yeah again i really hope this ending is canon
            Panam's ending is the only one that has V taking full control of herself and her destiny. In the other endings, she hands over control to someone else, be it Johnny or Arasaka. In that way, the game's theme is for self-actualisation, as V is only rewarded for bringing herself out of the mess she's in.
                not necessarily. [you missed an ending.](https://youtu.be/UIi-Ufnvkg0?t=144) :)

spoilers, obviously. >!this ending is insanely difficult. i came in with my overpowered build at level 44 doing 10,000+ damage per bullet with a smart SMG and had to crank the difficulty down to easy to pull it off. the enemies are bullet sponges who will 1-2 shot you depending on build and if you die during it, counts as the suicide ending and rolls credits, meaning you have to give up or redo the whole ending sequence up to that point. balls hard challenge run.!<
            She gives you a good reading on the Path of Glory ending too, at least if you do the solo mission. I still liked Panam's ending better though.
            I think all the endings suck in some way still. If you go with Panam then Johnny ends up merging with Alt.
    its also the only ending you can actually stay with Judy if you romance her. Otherwise, she'll just put an end to your relationship
    I did the don't fear the reaper ending and find it so silly that V can't leave the city after the solo raid on Mikoshi. Panam wouldn't be so busy that she has to keep blowing off your plans if Saul was still alive.
    I agree with the overall impression but is the Panam romance available to non-male characters? Can hardly be canon otherwise. I wouldn't even be certain CDPR ever says which one is canon, as a matter of fact.
        You don't need to romance her for the ending.  As female V my lovely Judy left with us.
            Ah, that's great, thanks for clearing that up.
            Really cool. As male V romancing Panam and  being friend with Judy, she sends a message and it's obvious she's on the road (outdoors, maybe by a camp fire) and says that leaving NC is the best choice.
        Can only romance Panam if your a male. The ending for Panam just feels more thought of or something like they put more time into the ending. Hope it's canon man
    I think that the panam ending is actually the Canon one. More. Like it at least because u have time left. To find a cure and I think it's the only ending that could possibly have a nice dlc for it To continue. All the other endings are just kinda sad and done for so I think the panam one is the most Canon likely.
What I was hoping was maybe they do what happens at the end of the fallout 3 where they add a dlc where you maybe go to Arizona and someone or something can save you from death because I'm not into the whole part where I go with Alt or I do the worst ending.
    “dlc where you maybe go to Arizona and someone or something can save you from death”

That would make a good transition to the sequel.(or whatever the online game ends up being)

2078 - where are saved but lose all your abilities As your body rejects it’s self.(hurray for skill resets in sequels)

I don’t know what the plot would be but there is a lot of room for things to happen. 

Possible plot lines-
Blackwall/AI might be loose thanks to you helping Alt. 

There is seems to be a war coming but it was just mentioned in the background.
The afterlife legend one also gives hope. Blue eyes is an unusual mysterious figure and if you read notes it tells you he’s privy to info no one you’ve encountered so far has. He also makes the point that he knows you’ll do the job because you’ll do anything to survive, then just before you follow through on the job you make sure that he understands what you expect from the deal. On top of that, it utilizes the most talked about place that you can’t get to, the luxury space station. Presumably from the inaccessible island in the bay that has rockets leave it every so often.
    mr blue eyes is maybe also tied to the organisation that brainwashed peralez
    I was very disappointed that I didnt get to play out the space walk and continue. Feel like this should have played out.
hope is an illusion.  OK, if you need hope, then go fucking blow your brains out.
    ...wut?
        That's a Johnny Silverhand line.
            Oh 😂😂😂 I was like "well that escalated quickly."
                I felt the confusion in your comment xD
                    I was like that went from 0-100 so fast I got whiplash 😂
                        Yeah johnny is edgy.
from a storytelling standpoint, panam's ending is the most likely to get a dlc. like tw3 blood and wine i suppose. where they end up in a new city (arizona?) and thus start a witch hunt for the cure to v's predicament. plus if I might add, although I like male v, I feel like the script was written for female V. dialogue exchanges do feel feminine.

for the romances, I think its pretty clear the best is panam for male v and Judy for fem v. again from a story standpoint, Judy leaves night city with you. River will not (ross and the kids, responsibilities). And Kerry is....well Kerry!
i was afraid to pick this one because i don't want my panam to get killed.
Whilst it was the closest to a happy ending, V is still 'dead'. Soulkiller zapped V when you plug into Mikoshi. What happens after is only an engram of V is created, and then uploaded into V's body.

This basically means the original V is dead, and a copy of his/her memory and personality survives in the body for ~6 months~ with a chance at curing their body so it doesn't die.

I can't really call that a happy ending. I wish there was an ending where Soulkiller is avoided completely with Johnny still removed and for V to survive with a chance of being cured long term.
Hope? Man..  the whole game made me falsely believe that there is hope somewhere, and every time I opened a door, the game just slammed it in my face... 
Now I think they're just naive and not hopeful... Not the creators of the chip, not the Japanese, hell.. not even Alt, probably the smartest body of information being there is could save V...
If they do find a way in a future DLC, it will probably be so unbelievable and it will make me feel so much worse :/
Cyberpunk 2 across the boarder? One can only hope.
true she sacrifice so much and the family for V so here is no turning back even when its only 6 month at least panam is here until the end.
There is the throwaway line about Vic's medicine and it sounds like V has some type of lethal auto-immune disease so "maybe" it's somewhat treatable (though to what extent/how much time you could buy isn't made clear). If it was treatable though, I would think Alt would know that, but eh maybe not. Still, I would've preferred instead of it being 6 months for the base time you're allotted it being more like a few years (or at least like 18 months, come on) would've been much better imo.
    Alt didn't take a number of things into consideration, so things it says shouldnt be considered absolute, even at the end.

In fact, I think Alt has a vested interest in Johnny getting the body and her getting V's engram
Yea the ending was nice but I don’t like how you need to load a old version of the game to keep playing
    Agreed, it feels so much better in skyrim for example when you end the game and come back and people remember what you did and their parts in the ending. Was much more satisfying imo. This one just leaves me lost on where to go from there
        find the secret ending ;)
            Isn't secret ending the "blaze of glory" one
                definitely not coming back as V from that ending.


just did this ending last night and felt like an asshole lol
                    Ya both Jude and panam leaves u, while the male ones actually stay in the ending (vice versa if it's the panam ending)
                        spoilers

&#x200B;

Jude and panam left me, I did the finish with arkasia - but seems they were done with me way before then, even after finishing their stories
                            Ya no one likes the arisaka ending
                        for me, i had no relationships and never finished panam/judy storyline.


they both left messages in the credits asking me to call them sometime but acted like i was too busy/famous for them now.


dunno if the credit messages change depending on relations.
                            [deleted]
                                > because they all said something like "Ah, voice mail again

I got the ending with Panam and only Rogue said that in the credits
                            Well you are among the top dogs in blaze of glory ending, plus might be super busy bcoz of the casino lmao.
                isnt dont fear the reaper the secret one?
                    Ya I think so, bcoz u literally walk in the front door and nobody dies
    I always hate when open world games does this. Like, I went through hell only to... never have the satisfaction of *being* in a game with my accomplishment done? This is so backward.

Horizon did this. Breath of the Wild did this. Shadow of the Tomb Raider also.

Like, just let me free roam Night City with a freed, breathing and non-dying V, FFS. As it stand I would be doing side quests and free roam knowing my character is slowly dying anyway.
        Yeah I felt the story build really well because you have a constant motivation to be cured.... But as soon as you get "cured" it's game over and you have to go back to dying again. Spending all your time while you're dying doing odd jobs for random people feels out of character for V to be doing lol
        Ff15 did the same thing and it was the worst. Though I accept the Panam ending and thought it was great, I really wish they didnt have to leave. Maybe that ending will be the true ending and we'll get some return to NC dlc, lol.
        RDR2 as well. Seriously enough with this shit.
        Completely get what you're saying but this is where the medium is at odds with its neo-noir setting. From a player satisfaction perspective, you'd always want to give players the choice of continuing to experience the world after the story is over. But the game exists primarily to tell this story, and that sense of dread and urgency are a huge part of the atmosphere.

In other words: wait for mods, or invest in a PC and then wait for mods.
        That would be cool. But for some games like Horizon, it would be basically two different maps before and after the story. So the devs would have to work twice to make it good. Probably would’ve made the game launch way later or more probably would split the team on the both maps and then they would be only half as good.
I could not agree more. It’s so incredibly frustrating that there’s no way to explore the unfathomably huge and detailed night city as a post-ending player character, simply exploring for exploring’s sake. Definitely makes the entire game less enjoyable imo
    Yeah man agreed
I don't know, I think limiting the direction of the ending of the story just for the sake of continuity in post-ending gameplay would be a pretty awful idea in practice.
    Nah man its been done with many games to a very successful degree, you can look at skyrim as a massively popular game that pulled it off
It reminds of of Breath of the Wild. You do all the quests and get all your gear then finally go to fight Ganon, who has plagued the world for 100 years, then once that's done you load back into your save before you fought Ganon. 

It made me feel really empty, as if everything I just did was pointless because the Hyrule I'm playing in is still an apocalyptic nightmare. Except with Cyberpunk, it felt even worse because the ending I got was so depressing.
I’m with you with the whole 6 months thing. I know you’re kind of told that there’s no way to fix his condition but it would be cool for a dlc to expand on it and maybe find cure to V’s problem.
    I feel like an issue that is raised though is how DLC is going to handle the different endings. I haven’t finished the game yet, mind you, but I mean it sounds like in a lot of cases >!either V or Johnny end up in cyberspace or whatever depending on the player’s choice, so not everyone is going to have a V to play as in the DLC.!< Plus, I heard there’s an ending where >!both V and Johnny decide to end their lives on their own terms, meaning that they’d have no one at all to play as.!< 

I guess I’m just curious to know if the DLC will fix the problems that come along with the endings or if it’ll be something totally different where we play as a different character or something. Or maybe as Johnny in the past.
        In Witcher 3, the bad ending wasn't considered "canon" so they just based it off of the other ones and left it a little vague.

I'm actually wondering if they have a dlc planned that is all about picking up with months left to live and finding a cure, because it seems so odd that they would force V to be in that same circumstance no matter what happens. All you can really influence is V's attitude and methods, but V's circumstance is very similar in all of the ones where they live.

That spacewalk shit was stupid though.
            I think it’d be cool if they somehow worked the ending people chose into it, for sure. Like I know it’s unrealistic, but I chose >!to let Johnny take V’s body for a reason.!< To be told that my intentional ending doesn’t actually exist would suck. I imagine if someone got Ciri killed in the Witcher it was an accident (although anything is possible.) I picked >!Johnny over V because my V cared about him, would take a bullet for him, and realized that he could have a whole life while she would only get another 6 months.!< 

If they could tweak the storyline you mentioned so that Johnny >!in V’s body!< is trying to find a way to >!get ahold of new bodies and save V from behind the black wall or whatever!< it would be ideal for me. 

Of course that doesn’t solve the issue of the >!suicide!< ending but that one seems hard to come back from.
        I get what you mean but a Johnny DLC would be cool.
            It definitely would and it would work well since it would take place pre-game. 

I’m just wondering if and how the dlc’s can expand on the main story of the game since the endings would make it difficult.
                Yeah, unless they make a different path for each ending in a dlc, it would be a lot of effort for an expansion. Or they make one ending canon but then that would make every other ending kinda pointless. Although I would love to see a continuation of the main story but I think if anything they’ll do a new story with a different main character.
                    Making one ending canon makes sense imo. The Panam ending is the "good" ending, and the only one with any real hope. Almost all other endings leads to the death of V.

Same situation if you give Johnny your body. It's no longer V in there, it's not "us". 

So yeah, the nomads ending seems to be the only ending with the possibility to branch out.
                        Well it might be possible that V survives the space casino heist
                            space casino V gave up on a cure. They live only to become the legend that will last.

Id say that Nomad ending and Arasaka ending (version where you go back to earth) are only ones that actually puts a way to find any cure.
                                But blue eyes is like, if u succeed, then he could provide a cure???
                        Sorry, to chime in on an old thread but man... Those endings do not leave much hope for any sort of decent DLC continuing the story.

Making one ending "canon" completely removes player agency from the endings. I don't think the endings were very strong either.
                            Yup, the endings were weak AF.  Especially if you chose to identify with Johnny.  They strip the player of all agency in the Rogue mission option, which is garbage. They give you all the agency to try and patch things up with Rogue with conversation points and decisions that lead you to a point in the mission where her and Johnny agree to start fresh together then bam! It ignores all the effort you put in up to that point and does not make use of any decision points from prior.  Hell, Mass Effect 2 and Witcher 3 allowed all these things and its strange how CDPR chose to take this weird route where they give you all this agency only to strip it away right at the end.
                    Yeah it’s a tough situation because dropping people’s endings could cause even more drama, but one canon ending or a new story in the same world would make the most sense.

Either way I’m hoping for a continuation of my ending that results in a happy ending for both V and Johnny. Unrealistic, sure, but it’s my hope lol.
                        My hope is that they go back to fix the endings for Johnny so that Rogue doesnt get fragged or at least put in some method where your conversation decisions/skills allow you to interrupt Smasher's sequence.  Huge missed opportunity there and really sours the game for me so much so that it makes replaying it in the current state unpalatable.
        You can easily do it just by telling players that the DLC is accessible if you achieved X,Y, or Z ending, and not on the other options.  It's not like anyone would be locked out, because the game saves automatically before talking to Hanako and takes you back to there if you choose to keepin playing.

So you could easily have the DLC be accessible for any of the "6 months to live" endings.
        \[spoilers for Mass Effect and Fallout\]  


 imagine it'll be like Mass Effect 3, where it was possible to have a canon ending to your mission back in Mass Effect 2, but if you play 3 it's assumed you're branching from a different point  


Or like in Fallout 3, where if you get the DLC you survive your sacrifice
It really does feel like dlc fodder. Will they follow through, we'll see.
This right here. I've never been more disappointed by any narrative as I am now. CDPR really couldn't just add a branch which allows you to live like normal? It's almost as if they want bad reviews.
    arguably a branch where you'd be just allowed to live; a "happy end", would go against many of the things this game sets forward. The World is dystopic, there are no happy ends, just degree's of bad and at least on my part I felt sort of empty and sad so its done its job messing with my feelings. Also think that's intentional.
        While I don't disagree that Night City is a dystopia, the game is full of moments and characters that constantly reinforce the idea that there are bonds and ideals that the corporations cannot crush. Nothing about Jackie or his family is dystopian, Johnny's bond with Rogue persists after 50 years, Panam and the Aldocaldos are repeatedly depicted as a tight bond outside the corporate structure, V can choose to be merciful in several major moments, Viktor and Misty are objectively good people, and so on. There are many good endings to stories in Night City (or at least, positive endings to certain chapters), so to say to the player that no matter what they do they're fucked takes away from a large part of what the game has said over the last (in my case) 50 hours.
            Yup, they give you agency to be a good person with reinforcing mechanisms around you from Jackie/Misty to Johnny/Rogue to V/love interest.  After 90 hours of playtime where they build you up with hope to then suddenly tear it away at every option was just not good.  I identified with Johnny through my play through and even got the bond with V pretty high so towards the point of no return i went through the heart wrenching goodbyes to Panam and then played as Johnny.  Throughout the entire mission it gives you hope that, even after 50 years, shes still in love with you as you are with her.  Right at the point where your character and her decide to start fresh everything gets smashed.  At that point, none of your choices matter and every end point is just a depressing mess.  Reading about the other endings makes it all the more depressing.

This is starting to feel like those "subverting expectations" style writing courses they try to do and the story just slaps you down hard no matter what.  Makes replayability very low as there is virtually no good outcome. Like honestly, how is Mass Effect 2 still the gold standard on this stuff after so long???  The game gave you agency to bond with characters and affect their end game while so many games continue to do this all or nothing stuff.  

I should have been able to save Rogue during the final assault instead of watching her die and in the end being Johnny where everyone i know or knew is dead is just not a good way to run a story for which you want a person to assume the identity for.
            It's the thing that I got from it. Yeah the corps' greed are squeezing whatever they can from the environment and don't care if they grind everyone into dust in the process, but they haven't. With all their power and might and tech people are still people. As utterly terrifying as Night City is there is still beauty in it, people still find beauty in it that doesn't revolve around the kill or be kill mentality.

The fact that every ending is damn near kicking your feet out from under you and laughing at you for thinking that has really left a sour taste in my mouth. Got 3 of the 5 ending sequences and uninstalled. Might come back to it in a year when as much of the stuff is fixed as possible but for now think I'm done.
        there's a happy end for literally all of the people you choose to spend time with.

so....CDR is doing a have your cake and eat it too moment. Like Viktor Vektor? Heck, just be nice to him. He's happy and your friend. Like Panam? Fuck it, go shoot shit up with her. Like Judy? Be there for her. Any1 u like you can get a happy ending for. Except yourself. Oh and except Jackie. And that's supposed to teach you some deep lesson about the dark world of CyBeRpUnK. 

The thing isn't even internally consistent.
        > arguably a branch where you'd be just allowed to live; a "happy end"

Not dying is not a happy ending. A happy ending would be you make so much money that you can retire rich and young, kinda like GTAV.

I was hoping V could live to fight another day. You can tell whoever wrote the endings in no way shape or form played the game except maybe a couple hours.
        No matter what, I experienced a hard to forget story and moved by it a lot, connected with the very well made side characters and amazed by the story of the game, even if it messed with my feelings like you said.

I'm happy with endings actually, it wouldn't feel organic and realistic this much if V wouldn't have been dying no matter what. I'm on the same page with you.

Edit: As for the sequel, I hope they create a new character, maybe tying it with V in the event chain of history somehow. I really hope they don't pull an unrealistic and hard to believe trick to bring V back. Things that can't be done by Arasaka or Alt, also shouldn't be available to Mr. Blue Eyes.
        How is it dystopic when the game offers to give the body to johnny, who gets to live? In every scenario V is the only one who gets absolutely fucked, even Johnny can live if the player chooses to.
            Johnny taking over your body and leaving the city is essentially the most positive ending, V doesn’t suffer anymore and Johnny is essentially redeemed of his douchey old ways and he moves on...
        They can still do this ending... While letting you continue to play the game after  it's done... I mean it just seems like they had to shove this thing out the door.
        It’s a game, it meant to be make people happy and plus it’s not like we are asking let that be the ONLY ending, you still have many choices. 

They just tucked up the story like what TLOU2 did
    You would give it a bad review for not having a happy ending?
        Yeah i don’t understand where a lot of these people are coming from either. Not all stories have happy endings, and V is in a pretty damn rough spot to begin with. There are hints throughout the game that things in Night City rarely end well, and V’s story goes along perfectly for that
Goes back to the original question from Dex, quiet life or blaze of glory?  We were set up for this fatalistic ending the entire time I suppose- and the theme of "night city's broken promises and dreams" was reiterated constantly.  Blaze of glory?  You're dead, maybe a legend about you but still dead.  Quiet life, you just go out peacefully.
it's a fail on basic entry level storytelling
They might not if they do the secret ending. Can't find jack shit about it though but apparently they live on
I thought v doesnt die in the panam ending
    V dies in 6 months no matter what you do for this ending.
        technically he's going to die, no reason in a DLC they couldn't find some miracle ripperdoc who can fix V or some other bullshit cure from a Corp.
            I highly doubt that DLC's will extend/explain the endings. It's most likely gonna be something like Johnny DLC or V/Jackie old days DLC.
                I don't think they'd do that tbh. I feel like any DLC might even be a separate character at this point. Pretty stupid way to end the game IMO. The problem with multiple choice endings is a DLC continuing them would most likely invalidate some of the endings... Which is I've always hated in RPGs. 

It removes player choice.
                    Use your imagination Choom,  think about how the game ended it branches out in the end with the Major choices, but more or less the same outcome. 

DLC could start branched out as well.

Here how I would like to see it:
1. you load up the Brand new DLC
2. A prompt pops up and asks you what Ending you chose.
3.You choose and the game starts a a Short Prologue basically on whatever you chose but will braid your "Past" into more Linear Story DLC.

You know, like the Lifepath thing at the start, nomad, Streetkid , Corpo.. you started differently but ended up meeting Jackie, took Dexs Job, etc.etc. 

That's how this could work, but.. not every ending, like Jonny taking over wouldn't work for my Theory or possibly the Arasaka ending (? Havent played that one yet ,so please no spoilers)

In which case I would see that they would pull the same thing they did on the Blood and Wine DLC where only the "good" endings will be Cannon.

Also because I doubt they will get Keanu Reeves to Voice Jonny for a whole freaking DLC "Branch" probably expensive  as hell.
                        Before you meet Hanako you get a call, to save your life and continue living, by doing so you get none of the shit ass gonk endings, canon af bruh. I will direct it 100% choom, its gonna be preem.
                        >Use your imagination Choom,  think about how the game ended it branches out in the end with the Major choices, but more or less the same outcome.

So it either means that the developers have to pick an ending to be canon. Which is fucking stupid in an open ended game. Might as well not allowed for multiple endings at all in that case. Removes all player agency from the main story. Which was my point.

or

It means they have to craft some sort of DLC that incorporates all of the endings... Including the ones where Johnny takes over V's body and leaves the city. Which seems nigh impossible especially for CDprojectRed to handle correctly.

&#x200B;

I don't think they "can't" do it. I just think the endings are varied enough that they may go with Option 1. Which is super lame.
                            Well I would guess that some endings would be disabled , as I said I doubt they would get Keanu into this game again expect for maybe a couple of one liners.

So I would assume that some endings are considered .. bad endings which wouldn't progress into a Story DLC.. just like the suicide one.

But the main endings , Night City Afterlife Boss and the Nomad one could very definitely be continued which like I said would simply branch out at the beginning only to twirl into a linear story just like the beginning of the game , and if you think about it, there are only 3 endings which would make sense to continue on Nomad, Afterlife Boss, and Return from the Arasaka Space station..
        You dont know that. Its pretty clearly, and intentionally, open ended. Probably so they have something to use for sequels/dlc.
            I mean Alt that fucking AI told us so and that shit is probably the smartest thing around in the Cyberpunk universe and if you pick the Arasaka ending the smartest brains in Arasaka reached the same conclusion so I don't really see how V can be saved if the best possible candidates for saving her life were both pretty  set on her dying in 6 months.

But there is to hoping I guess.
                That kinda ruined the game for me. I reached the point of no return tonight and upon reading about it I ended being spoiled by the whole ending. No hard feelings though, but during my playthrough I was hard focused on the main quest as I wanted to save V and save her life ASAP since this was obviously an urgency, I would then focus on the other content afterward.

Turns out that not only its a lost cause, but I'm thrown back pre point of no return after the end anyway. Which condemn me to forever be stuck with an AI slowly killing V in all my future playthrough/free roam sessions.

It sucks.
                    Yup I feel you hard, exactly how I played my V and I want to feel like all my work to cure V meant something. I wanna be in night city not as someone slowly dying so I don't feel weird doing all this side content that just feels out of place for V to be doing
                        This reminds me we’ll forever be plagged by the random OLD RELIC MALFUNCTION condition until the end of time since we never truly get rid of that.

Best design decision ever lol

>It sucks.

100% this. I played a game a similar way until I got to the point of no return. Then I did all the side content but like... Most of it felt super frivolous. Let me go scuba diving while this AI is frying my mind... It doesn't make sense narratively.

I was hoping, like you, for an ending that would allow me to re-enter the world and do all the side shit after finishing the main story. But it's all tied to Johnny, which was a mistake, so I understand why they did it the way the did... CDPR has a problem with story writing this way. Witcher 3 had similar problems.
                Alt isn't the smartest thing though, she said it herself. She can't use soulkiller to its fullest capabilities after all the Arasaka changes.


Also, best candidates yet. Remember there are private networks like the voodoo boys that netwatch is trying to control. Plus, a whole unexplored world.
                Super late to the party but I would note that Alt is very deliberately *not* depicted as omniscient or flawless (She has to wipe out the Voodoo boys to save herself from Netwatch if you trust the Netwatch agent, she says she's been trying and failing to breach Mikoshi for 50 years, she obviously screws up V's diagnosis (assuming Alt wasn't lying, which we have no reason to think she was)). 

In the Arisaka ending Hellman analogizes what has happened to V as similar to the damage inflicted by radiation poisoning, but tbh that line was reasonably comforting to me: It's the year 2077 and you're telling me no one anywhere has figured out radiation poisoning, not even to mitigate it?? 

Beyond that, the reason people like the Panam ending is that it is the only ending that is geared towards leaving the player with hop: Hope for a cure, but also (and separately) hope for an escape from the dystopia they have been living in for the last 20-60 hours. I would have lived to see more ambiguity, or just flat out more hope, from the other ostensibly legitimate and good endings.
                    How tf can adam smasher live looking like he does but V cant lol, there has to be a way.
                        Adam's basically a complete cyber body, which is sort of why the Arisaka endings don't bother me. 

Assuming that at some point they will get the risks of a fully cyber body down to a tolerable level, then getting engram'd and then stuffed in a cyberframe later on is fine.
                            One of the side missions suggests editing engrams is possible. Wouldn’t want to emerge as diet V in a new body with all negative tendencies eliminated (as defined by Arasaka).
            You die no matter what. As soon as you enter mikoshi alt uses soulkiller on you and creates an engram, a copy of you. Is a copy of you really you? What makes you you?
        Damn thats kind of disappointing. I wonder what they might do for expansions then.
            Could be another protagonists story. I like to think that V was our introduction into the CP77 universe; or it could be early / mid-game expansions + possibly new endings who knows.
                Another protag will make all of cyberpunk feel so wasted though.. like u make ur own char, ur own choices and relationships and now u gotta make a new protag? Nah, i hope not
                    What's wrong with telling multiple stories in Night city? V became a Legend, would be interesting to hear about them and maybe run into old friends time to time while you make new ones

I really liked how Gta4 did this with it's DLC, same world different stories
                        Well for gta4 we still got a definitive ending for Niko, there are way too many loose ends for cyberpunk.

2. Im ok playing with another character for a sequel. The story for V seems unfinished and the devs possibly made it so open-ended for reason.
                i'm betting that they will just be addtional quests in the world, so you need to load a save before the final mission anyway.
                    I feel like the story was created to make the multiplayer have respawning in the lore. I feel like the DLC will also incorporate the immortality factor after Arisaka discovers the chip works.
                        Not like the cloning vats haven't been a thing in other major cyberpunk fiction. Cyberpunk is a perfect precursor to worlds like altered carbon.
        Not necessarily, he has about 6 months to live but nothing says he can't find a cure in that time. The end credits could imply that he's dead and therefore can't answer. But on the all along the watchtower mission you can talk with cassidy and his dialogue gives me major vibes that V doesn't die, as long as you don't think he will and think that you will survive. That it's all about outlook.  
Realistically it doesn't look great for V but you never know.
            Yup got the same vibe. Got the same feeling at the end of MGS when Snake gets Fox Die and Naomi says there is no way to know when he will die and he just has to live (and he does, for quite a while). Plus there are several Kojima references in the game.
        One of the endings hints that Delamain might be able to help V. 

&#x200B;

I think the "cure" will still come in the form of some AI related bullshit. 

&#x200B;

I'll say I'm disappointed in the endgame in general. The endgame felt rushed much like the latter 1/3 of the Witcher 3 felt empty.
    He doesn't. Im guessing they're saving up this ending for a possible sequel/dlc in search of a cure.
        Yea that was my thought at first too.
    I'll just wait for mods. Then V lives. lol.
        Step 1 of grief:Denial
I thought the story was great, but the endings were shit.
V doesn'T die in the Arasaka contract ending no?

Or is it assumed that they will not find a body for him?
Did the same thing as you, jesus the Hanako ending is depressing (for a character that romances Judy and befriends Panam). You're a test rabbit in a cyberstation and by the time you return to Night City all the people you cared for are gone and you live your last 6 months in pain, misery and loneliness.

But the Panam ending is soo good, I really hope its canon and we get a DLC where they find someone who cures V. Also really hope they make another game, maybe exploring Europe or USSR as there is a lot of mentions of this.
I was really mad at the Hanako ending. >!She says "Help me and I'll get you into Mikoshi". Fine ok. At no point does it become clear that I'm not going through with my Alt / Johnny plan of separating us inside the subnet, and that instead I'm literally choosing to murder Johnny. A full on assault of the tower wasn't the role I was playing V as, so it seemed the most in character for me to choose the other, and it ended up being completely the opposite of "in character."!<

>!What I DID like about that ending was the sort of double cross with the whole Saburo / Yorinobu thing and Hanako's true intentions. !<

&#x200B;

It's a little like when the dialogue option doesn't line up with what V actually says, or doesn't make clear the tone / intention with which V will deliver the line, so you end up pissing people off, when the option you picked actually seemed like the "nice" thing to say.
    fuuuuuuucking PREACH.

Just another incomplete game. A little hole they didn't patch.

Actually...can you do the voodoo thing at all? Guess they just ran out of time or whatever.

:/ why is every game I play like this? It always ends with a great plan (either mentioned and forgotten, or something obvious never mentioned) being completely overwritten by a bunch of shit someone 'clever' threw up? OoOoOoO NiGhT cItY sTeAlS yOuR IdEnTiTy.

nah bitch. I beat night city. And if the game had let me give Jacquito any one of the 112 medi-injector things in my pocket, we woulda beat it together.

I think you can beat life too. But nah, every fucking artist out there wants to force me to fail to teach me some life lesson they just figured out.

Been through those failures. Learned from them. Changed. But in the long run? The real lesson is: don't waste your time sticking around in failure.
one is V takes on Arisaka solo and lives. If you fail at any point you restart at the point of no return.
    How do you get that ending?
        You need 70% you only live once. And then when you have to chose how to raid the tower you select the johnny and rouge one and sit there for a few minutes. From what I can tell to get 70% all you have to do is do all the johnny side quests and when your at where he's buried say he saved your life then say he fucked up then give him another chance.
            damn, gonna need to try that out in a second playthrough, i only got that thing to 60%
            Is this confirmed? I‘ve read varying things about supporting him throughout the game but not to the point of being a suck up.

Can‘t remember what I said at his grave. But I was stuck at 60% as well.

Actually quite looking forward to NG+ when it‘s out. Maybe together with the actual PS5 version. In that playthrough I could save Takemura as well.
                https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CubJ5M6aQGY&

Follow this. I reloaded a manual save, followed these dialogue options when visiting Johnny's grave, and didn't even complete the band side quests after. My score was at 50% and I was still able to get the secret ending option to trigger. All the enemies are level 50 in that ending, though. And it doesn't really change the ending you get post-choice.
                    "Doesn't really change the ending" meaning V still has 6 months to live?
                        Thats, right. V still only has 6 months to live... Only thing that really changes is rogue and the nomads are still alive.
                I did it myself so I'm pretty sure it's correct unless there is another important aspect I just happened to do throughout my playthrough without realising. I was at 60% (and couldn't do the solo ending) went back a few hours re did the grave sequence with everything else the same, got to 70% and could now do the solo ending.
I agree with all points. I took the contact with Arasaka because I skipped the Rogue quest line and didn't really see the point in storming the HQ with the nomads. Arasaka was the only option I felt had any future besides dying in 6 months or becoming an AI. They straddled the line of making it a bad or good ending. Bleak but open ended like you said.  I was just glad to be rid of Johnny honestly. Mostly because his relationship felt forced upon you. Like you were supposed to like him in the end no matter what you wanted for V.
    [removed]
        Regardless of which ending you get, the game definitely "just ends". And all of the main characters cease to exist. I probably won't pick it back up until DLC arrives or I finally get a 3080 and just want to see the graphics.
            [removed]
                I was surprised how much the corpo lifestyle was painted as the "wrong" choice. I guess you're technically ex-corpo, but still. Got annoying at the end having Johnny pushing against it so much. I feel like a more fleshed out background system would have the corpo choice take over Arasaka to use the tech for yourself.
                    [removed]
Yeah I romanced Judy and her video message at the end was vague but kinda mean. She just kind of said "I'm leaving town. Fuck this City. You either become an asshole, or get taken advantage of by one. Have a nice life." Like...? I have six months to live and I'm literally coming back to Earth. Did I miss something? Did Arasaka kill her parents?

Adding this: I did the suicide ending first because I wanted V to have the final say since Johnny was such an overbearing, annoying, and malicious prick all 40 hours. Seeing him sit next to you all like "you know, this outcome is alright with me, too." I don't fucking care, that's WHY I'm doing this.
    Out of twisted curiosity I choose it too, because I wanted to see all endings and I knew it'd end the game right then and there, and the call from Judy was one of the most emotional scenes I've seen in a game.  Really hit me in the feels.
        [deleted]
            That was absolutely devastating. Really well voice acted.
                I just "finished" the game with this ending. I did not know that this would happen, as I thought, this would be a suicide attack with both being half in half in charge.  


It broke my heart. I am not happy with this one bit....  


But then again, while I would choose the Panam ending with Judy by my side, I do not see a reason why I would risk my new found family with such an attack on Arasaka.  


Especially when I played a sneaking, hacking V, I would have liked to get an option to do this on my own terms so to speak.  


I will most likely not go back to play with this character again.   
As all the other options now seems cheesy for me.   
Gonna start a new character I guess and then go with Panam and Judy.

But this incarnation of V .. well, she killed herself.... even if I would no have wanted this to happen and it not making sense in my headcanon on how I played her :/  
Well, can´t win it all everytime, tough luck I guess.
Don't want to be a corporate shill but in a dystopian future like cyberpunk where technology is above all else I think the ending with Hanako and signing the contract is the best, I know johnny point of view where corporations are getting out of hand but litarally it's to late to do anything, they are litarally gods not even countries can do much against them if V's goal is to be big there is only 2 option, die a legend like johnny or join the ones at the top. I know it's bleak but hey it's a dystopian setting can you really expect a happy ending. This game reminds me a lot of altered carbon, the Netflix tv show. The ending of this game is what I imagined when humanity cheated death, yes it will only be affordable to the rich first just like any technology but give it a few decades it will trickle down to the common people. This will probably expedite the process in which the earth condition gets worse due to earth quickly dwindling resources but millitech seems to have their sights on mars and other plants so maybe it is best.
    Based on other endings, arasaka falls into ruins after V's intervention, so I don't think soulkiller is the way to go about saving V.
        when you load up v's brain, arasaka is taken over by an engram of the old guy. They guy that started arasaka. He is downloaded into his son's body. And it all works out. He doesn't go to war with Militech.....etc
            He is now immortal which is probably the worst scenario out of any.

If you take the Johnny or Nomad endings, Arasaka basically falls into ruins.
I like this one the best too, this is the only one in a sense where V continues to live.

Tho its likely the darkest one, as theres the possibility shes trapped forever. But at least on this ending, her fate isnt entirely decided. 

Arasaka corp has also made breakthroughs with the resurrection of their father. This could just be another opportunity to continue the breakthrough. 

Its grim, dark, and uncomfortable, but its definitely gonna push people away. But i think it was her best chance.
    I knew probably 10 hours into my 70 hour playthrough that the game would give me the choice of getting made into a construct.  You could see it a long time coming.  I knew that's what I wanted to do, but when I was sitting there in the space station, I thought about it and decided to return to earth.  Looking back at all the character developments and relations, I didn't think it was fair to leave it all behind and sell my soul to arasaka.  I think I made the right choice in that regard because if you play some of the other endings, you'll notice most of them make mention of Arasaka going down in some form.  IIRC they called the "secure your soul" program a "curse" in one of them.
        >you'll notice most of them make mention of Arasaka going down in some form.  IIRC they called the "secure your soul" program a "curse" in one of them

In the Panem ending there's a terminal in Arasaka tower with some emails that say "Secure Your Soul" actually wasn't working very well yet, there's a list of people it was used on and most were seriously injured/killed by it or their construct didn't come out right.  It also said the real reason for the program was for Arasaka to extract blackmail from the constructs.  Perhaps that all gets revealed to the public in the endings where you attack the tower?
What I got upset about Arasaka is that there were factions within the company yet they didn't develop into anything. Are you saying I couldn't have helped Yorinobu or this apparent liberal grand-daughter, I just had to choose the porcelain girl?  


Knowing that Yorinobu was waging war against the other companies so they would all crumble with in fighting makes me think that destroying Arasaka is just whatever. Militech, Biotechica or another massive corporation will just take over.
    That would have been neat, more choice is always good. That said though I'd still side with Hanako, Yorinobu is starting shit with other corps and corpo wars is bad for normal people.
Yea the in game ads about the nanobot therapy costing 700,000 a month or whatever are what I think the DLC might be about.
>Giving your body to Johnny is bafflingly bad to me, YMMV obv but goddamn why tf would you ever do that ?

For me, it was less "giving V's body to Johnny" and more "picking the option that allows V to survive more than 6 months". In theory, it was the best option for all involved: Johnny gets a body with a full lifespan ahead of it, and V gets to live indefinitely as an AI. But since V apparently didn't contact anyone afterwards, judging from the reactions in the credits, I can only assume either something went wrong or I misinterpreted something. Especially given Misty's reaction.
Re: giving your body to Johnny

Personally I think it's a pretty reasonable option for a lot of people. If your relationship with him was bad then I definitely agree it's a pretty terrible option, but if you had a decent or good relationship to him then I don't think it's weird at all. If you were in a hypothetical situation where you could choose between living for 6 months or a friend living out a natural life, it doesn't seem far-fetched at all that some people would want to choose the latter. From a purely utilitarian viewpoint there's no question, though of course the real world isn't a hypothetical utilitarian ideal, but the general logic is there. I'm either going to die now or die in 6 months, but my friend could go on living a full life. Doesn't seem unreasonable to sacrifice the little life you have left for someone to live out the rest of their life.
I also thought of the same when I first got the Arasaka ending. But there's one thing that I couldn't deal with, was Saburo got reincarnated over his son. That shit was evil.

Then I tried Panam's ending which unleashed Alt to fuck up Mikoshi and thus Arasaka felt damn satisfying.
Thing with getting soulkilled is not only, well, V dies, but it's evident from other endings that Arasaka kind of falls into ruin following the events of V's intervention.
    Not sure what you mean. Helping them get rid of Yorinobu unfucks what he was fucking up. And in the  other endings you really only fuck over Mikoshi, not the entire megacorp.

And the mind uploading is only "dying" in the sense that your body stops working. Your mind is fine. You even probably get a new body later.
A "fusion" ending where they both shared the body or combined and became one person is what I wanted.
    What did I invest 20 points into intelligence for if not for a Delamaine-style merger of minds???
    EXACTLY. I really thought that would be an option if I did enough of Johnny's quests, but nope.
he even keeps talking to you in the space station, i had hopes at that time that we would be able to just return to night city life with him and the synthesia and everything but nope, gotta kill the player up there in orbit and make me reload like nothing happened. i mean... what the fuck? the game felt super exiciting just moments ago, and then you slam the breaks? what story telling is this
    It could be just memories not Johnny but who knows
That'd be nice- find a way to maintain the current state, stop it from progressing.
I found it strange there were no "middle path" options
This. This is exactly what I wanted too.
    So irritating, I refuse to play the game until they fix it in a dlc or som, or I just won’t touch the game whatsoever
I just finished the game and am super pissed.  Making me go through all the effort to patch things up with people as Johnny and holding out hopes that you can start fresh with Rogue only to have everything come crashing down as a surprise fuck you moment is just not cool.  Reading about all these endings just makes me even more pissed because there just simply isnt any way for you to positively affect the outcome or take agency in your own ending.  Everything is just "too bad! Gotcha! You're dead!"
What do you have to do to get a drink named after you?
[deleted]
    Yes, but the game repeatedly breaks the rules for the genre and the tropes.

When you kill off a beloved character early in the game, you need to have other equally loved characters ready to take over. That worked in the first book of GoT, but here it does not work, they relied way too much on the "Oh it's Keanu" factor. And Keanu does not really do anything until the late parts of the game. 

When you have a doomed hero, then he better be able to save the people around him, cause otherwise his sacrifice is empty. Instead V loses Jackie, Evelyn Parker (who had an especially horrible fate), Rogue and probably a few more. Examples, John Hartigan or Marv in Sin City, they knew they were doomed, but made a difference.

Also the game breaks it's own code that it kept stressing: If you rather want to die in a blaze of glory, or have a long life as a nobody. When you side with Arasaka you get the worst ending possible, despite selling out.

Also it's still a game, meant for entertainment. If I wanted a sad "Everything is awful" story, I could read 1984 or similar books...
        [deleted]
            > I mean the point of the story is more about the journey than the end

V even says this multiple times through the game.
            I don't know, I still didn't finish the game but I already feel awful, I knew that it won't be a "happy game" but in my foolishness I hoped that my choice will matter a little more. 

I wonder... maybe it wouldn't hit me that hard if the 2020 was different, but with how it was, I wish that at least I could do some "happy endings" for other characters...
        Disagree the game doesn't break its own code; siding with arasaka is the only way you can live on. But by doing that you're betraying your values, your friends, ur love interests, literally everybody. All the non-arasaka endings have some sense of living a short life in a blaze of glory
            That's the strongest hint to the contract actually saving your life imo. Dialogue and lore can be argued but it makes a lot of sense thematically and narratively. 

I just disagree with the game's implications that you really betray that much.
            Nope. Cause the Arasaka ending does not mean you live on, Takamura tells you himself that the surgery did not save you and that you only have a  few months left. 

Your only choice at this point is to go back to Earth, as a half-lobotomized shadow of yourself and die in a few months.....

Or to upload a copy of yourself to Mikoshi, while your original body will die and you sign yourself and all your rights over to Arasaka. A cruel twist on the promise of "saving" your life. 

The Arasaka endings are the worst possible outcomes. Cause you neither have a blaze of glory, nor did you save your own life. 

The Arasaka ending needs a complete rewrite: they save your worthless ass and "kill" Johnny. You should be rewarded with a corner office in the Arasaka corp, as another faceless stooge bound to them. Now you got your "long life", if you wanna call that a life. It would have fit your betrayal and the desire to save yourself way better and would have been in line with the "Survival at any cost" playstyle.

They also should have allowed us to betray Arasaka in the scene in the tower and let us kill Yorinobu, his sister and Hellman, at the cost of your own life (as an option of "last second remorse"). But I can understand the reason why they did not allow that, because by the time you are in the tower you already made your decision to trust Arasaka. A terrible mistake.
                Arisaka ending isn't the worst. It's one of the only 2 (maybe 3 if you think nomads can actually save you) endings that can potentially save V. They aren't going to keep you prisoner because they will let you leave if you want. Signing the contract is just legal shit in case they never find a way to put you back into a body. This ending can leave you "alive" at an unspecified later date. The other one being working with Mr Blue in the afterlife to do the Crystal Palace Heist because he seems to be offering V something more valuable than money (which V has a ton of at this point) meaning it could be a solution to their problem. This ending has the highest chances of a DLC because you can actually play it out.
        Hard disagree.

The cyberpunk genre is defined by melancholic endings.

Johnny literally says at one point in the panam ending "not in this town, not to people like us" when V asks for a happy ending.

That's cyberpunk.
            Nope, read what the creator had to say in an interview from Dec 2020 (also my character is not a terrorist like Johnny):

“*Cyberpunk* is political, but it’s not political in a  blue-state-red-state-conservative-liberal \[way\],” he says. “It is  basically \[that\] people deserve to be able to get a decent meal, live in  a decent place and do all that if they’re willing to work for it, and  not get screwed over by people more powerful than they are, who may not  need to even screw them over, but are doing it on principle because they  think they can do it.”

Thankfully, in the game at least, that’s where the heroes come in. “Characters in *Cyberpunk*  are heroes, and survive and do well because they are willing to fight  for family or friends, for their neighbourhoods,” Pondsmith tells us.

        >  If you rather want to die in a blaze of glory, or have a long life as a nobody.

EXACTLY THIS. I was so hyped to blow up the new Arasaka tower like Johnny did in the past, or something major that impacts the world, but it feels like your death is completely meaningless! What happened to getting ourselves remebered in The Afterlife?
It felt like the game had so much build up but just fizzled out.
        Some people even think in 1984 Orwell implies in the glossary of terms that Oceania eventually collapsed, based on his past-tense verbiage in the section on Newspeak and the fact that he fought very hard to include that glossary in the book even when it would have been more lucrative for him to remove it.
        I couldn’t fucking agree more, it’s a game so just give an option for the happy ending then everybody happy. 

Jesus it’s like TLOU2 all over again, these stupid writer/ developer centered stories need to change, make it a truly open ending game, rather than pretending to be one. 

In my opinion the story of this game is heavily underdeveloped, like every time I enter a new area a stranger would call me then suddenly we are buddies doing jobs, no introduction, no context what so ever. It almost feel like they hired different writers to write stories for each character then magically taped them together through robotic phone introductions
If you felt hopeless then the writers did their job.  Cyberpunk dystopia is about mankind's futile fight against technological encroachment and the loss of our souls.  I think a lot of people are forgetting this.  Everyone is going to get what they want (an unchecked life in Night City as a merc) with the first DLC I would be willing to bet a million dollars on it.
    Thing is that the game was heavily promoted as allowing you to make your own decisions. Instead the player repeatedly loses control at decisive junctions in the game and is forced on a railroad experience with no way out.

Dystopia is one thing, but taking away control by the way of cutscenes or outright forbidding certain actions, is a very lame story telling vehicle.
        > taking away control

That's sort of the point of the cyberpunk genre. No one has any control over their lives. Taking control away from V and by extension us is a major theme within the genre. Even though V gets to choose who to go with his fate has already been sealed. Everything was out of his control.
            That would be ok in a book, but not in a first person open world game. If everything was out of anyone's control then people like Saburo Arasaka or Morgan Blackhand would not exist.
        “ Thing is that the game was heavily promoted as allowing you to make your own decisions. Instead the player repeatedly loses control at decisive junctions”


Getting to make decisions doesn’t mean you win. Just like in real life. Sometimes you do all the right things and still fail.
        There will never be a game like the one you are describing. Never. It's not even about technology like it was back in the day when people expected cutscene level graphics in game. There just simply isn't enough time to make a game like this where every single choice has an impact. The amount of man hours in writing alone would be insane. There are games that come close but none of them have a blank canvas MC to play as. They all have a character that has clear goals and intentions that you kind of tweak a little or go along with as you play.
        Wait so let me get this straight.

You want to be told a story, but you also want to write the story yourself with unlimited potential paths?

Might want to check your logic choom
            Unlimited paths? I would be happy if one of the 7 endings was not doom and gloom.

I'm hoping they end up tying all the endings to the Crystal Palace in different ways, and somehow V finds a cure during the Palace events. The only thing they would technically have to de-canonize would be the let Johnny take over style branches of the endings. The other options would all be quite compatible with each other.
    What's the crystal palace?  Am I dumb or is this something from the Cy2020 tabletop game or something?
        It's an in-game private space station for the unimaginably uber-rich. In the Path of Glory ending V undertakes a job to infiltrate and steal from the Crystal Palace in exchange for an unexplained "promise" from a new character who is implied to be very powerful.
        It's a luxury resort of sorts on a space station.
Wanted to see the Jefferson guy more- the whole brain control sidequest.  I wanted to see that quest out to completion and take out the people who were controlling the future mayor.  The call at the end kind of implies he like dies or goes crazy.
No, that pissed me off so bad.
    Right, finally a cool legendary trench coat. Too good to be true I guess
        I am curious if it is glitched, I assumed they would be the items you get rewarded, but I didn't seem to get shit after "resetting back".
            That's what I assume
            Same, I think they mean special weapons you can pick up in certain endings. I got rogues pistol and it carried over.
        I got one off placid
It's probably for the DLC. Look at the stuff, it looks like cowboy shit that you'd wear in Arizona in a Cyberpunk universe. 

Keep that in mind and do what you will with it :)
    >Anyone with the Panam ending figure out how to get the three legendary items in the chest next to the basilisk? Takes you to the credits and you don't get to keep them... A coat pants and boots

this is actually a good theory if it happens ill come back to this
Meanwhile, I got to keep the fucking legendary shovel I looted...
Ahaha looking at the endings for the first time I really did go "I wonder if CDPR is gonna wind up Broken Steel-ing this with DLC". Reminded me a bit of the Mass Effect 3 ending debacle, but less hopeless.
  I hope they end up tying all the endings to the Crystal Palace in different ways, making them all canon like with life paths, no matter how you start (nomad, corpo or street kid) they end up the same.
    Maybe nomad contacts have located some rare tech or genius up there that can help.  Bam aldecados going to space.  Hell what if an ending there means they get to be space nomads.  Hopping planet to planet.
The suicide ending was fucking INTENSE. The voice logs afterwards are horrifying, especially if you romanced Judy.

Well the job was to steal the database of the casino
The job was to steal the client data off the station not just blow it up. Up to your imagination if V got away with it or not.
If you chose to go back to earth you have 6 Months to live you make it back to earth
I feel confident that the blaze of glory happened. True Rocker Boy fashion
Think that's the point, V ends up smashing everything if you want in game.  It was 6:00 AM when I finished looking at all the endings, probably 4:00 AM when I finished the space station one.  I literally couldn't sleep quick enough.
    Dude I was playing on an all night bender when the devil tarot appears... Scared the ever loving shit out of me.
Yeah, my V let Johnny take over, but decided to go back to her own body on earth. I got a scene with River since I romanced him, where he seemed concerned about V’s mental state.
    So the only people who get to enjoy their time with V are Judy and Panam?

I hate when the game designs a preferential LI
        No.

If you romance River, and then take the Panam route for ending, River joins you and the nomads out in the open road (90% sure this is the case). 

So you gotta finish the Panam story (obv not romancing her), so the Nomads helping you is a thing for ending.
            I heard that this happens with Judy but not River—which checks out with the fact that he’s prioritizing his family now

I’d love if that was the reality tho
                That's a shame, but i can also see why he doesn't join.

To me it seems like Female V with Judy going with Nomads is the best ending for all chars involved (well not all chars, but ones you do quest with)

River has his sister and nephews to take care off
Panam has her family now, Judy on the other hand lost pretty much everything and wants to leave Night City anyway.
                    My ideal ending wouldn’t involve leaving Night City, tbf. I’d want to stay right there and spend the time with him and his family, over chasing a pipe dream in the middle of fucking nowhere.
U can take Judy with u, if u do the panama ending
I could be wrong but I think you can bring Judy with you in the Panam ending as long as you did Panams quest but I agree with you on the endings.
    You can, but that's more of a "Hey, I'm here too!" sort of thing. By hooking up with Panam, you get an entire extra ending option. By hooking up with Judy, you get a "bye-bye now!" call to her and then you get forced to side with Arasaka or do the Johnny ending. Total missed opportunity IMO.
        Actually u can take a romanced Judy with you, in the panam ending, just make sure u do both.
        I was really looking forward to doing the Panam route UNTIL I find out that Kerry legit breaks up with Male V if you go that route. The relationship legit was the shortest out of ALL the relationships in the game.  I feel like the Nomad ending or/and the Heist ending should be considered canon since both give you a sense of hope that you may find a cure.  I forced myself to do the Rogue (heist) ending due to that being the only ending you actually get to be with your love interest (if you go for Kerry or River).  It also adds a bit of mystery to who the mysterious man with blue eyes is and what he has planned if V was to succeed in his Heist.  We will see early next year if we are lucky!

    Lol I feel like im stuck there right now. I don't know what I'd do without the internet. I'm blown away by the fact being stuck in "cyber limbo" is supposed to be the bad ending. It feels like so much of science fiction is fear of what's next and new. I was really hoping for something like Ghost in the Shell's or Neuromancer's forward thinking strangeness, that Alt's solution should have been a bridge to the new, instead of just highlighting what's human. I thought Cyberpunk was about what's beyond human.
        What's more transhumanism than cheating death? I don't see why people are viewing Mikoshi as something bad.
            Copies are copies. You are dead but you created a virtual copy of yourself that thinks it is alive. A real shame to the poor child
                This. A copy may have all the original properties but it’s still not the original. So even if he was copied to an engram and it didn’t still end with V dying after a few months, he was dead the minute he was killed by the soul killer and *copied*.
                    That's the thing though we still haven't define what consciousness really is, if it is simply the neurons firing in our brains then, a 1 to 1 copy of that is by definition your consciousness, if an engram simply scans the brain and converts it into an AI then it complicates the problem even more because we don't even know what a conscious AI look like let alone how it works.
                        Even if you would consider engram a conscious it would still be a duplicate.
                            that the whole point of my argument, since we do not know the nature of consciousness we cant say that a copy isn't you. you cannot make claims about dying if we don't know what happens to your consciousness after you die. if a teleporter deconstructs your body in the atomic level what says that the reconstructed version is still you, we do not know the nature of consciousness in our universe, until it is defined then you cannot claim otherwise. if engram V remembers how he or she became an engram then what makes her a duplicate?
                                In my view it’s not about if the engram is the actual person or not. It’s all about instances for example you can create an instance of a new process on a computer ok now let’s go further and spawn the exact same process again it’s not the same instance. Now if we were to kill the original instance you would be left with a copy that is not the original instance but exactly the same in every regard. My point is the original instance is dead regardless of the perfect copy still running. I hope I clarified my point.
            Having played Cyberpunk, the framing.

Unless you mean conceptually, if you ask people if the human lifespan should be increased, they'll likely say no, having accepted that death is a part of "life" despite technology also being part of it.
            They call it soul killer because it's doing exactly what it's named after.

You can't just transfer what makes you "you" into the digital realm. That's not how consciousness works.

The engram would be you for all intents and purposes, and act like you would, change like you would, but when you go in you die. The copy of you is "born", and has a discrete life from that point on.

That's why some would prescribe those machines as evil. If employed en masse, they would commit genocides to create an army of engrams, all corporate property of Arasaka. "don't worry, the law will catch up and recognize engrams as people" was very disconcerting.
        [deleted]
            You don't get stuck in Mikoshi, that's not what Hellman says. Arasaka has a service for extremely rich clients who want to be immortal via body-hoping, it's called Secure Your Soul. That's what the contract is. You'll be in Mikoshi until they find a compatible body to give you. Then you'll live again. 

On the other hand joining Alt beyond the Blackwall does mean you'll be there "forever". Which is technically not really dying, since your mind will keep existing there, but you're also gone from the physical world for all intents and purposes.
                [deleted]
                    Getting a new body because yours can't be saved is why they're offering the contract in the first place though. And I'm pretty sure the offer is free, you didn't pay for removing the biochip or the weeks of treatment either, and they don't mention a price with the contract either. 

You make an agreement that they stop you from dying in exchange for helping them retake control from the traitor son. You did your part and it seems like they're doing theirs. They let you leave no questions asked if you don't sign, makes no sense to only betray you if you sign and be cool with you if you don't.
                        [deleted]
                            I agree it's left vague af, just seems to me like the whole point of that ending is that you live in exchange for giving up the fight and all. Like in the opposite ending where you attack them, you're fighting the megacorp and become a legend, but you die. It's more narratively and thematically fitting if the ending where you surrender yourself to them actually saves your life, but at the cost of everything else. Ideals vs life.
                                [deleted]
We haven't really been given any in-game reason to believe the "self", "soul", "ghost", etc actually transfered. 

The person living in the body of Johny is dead. The construct we have is a copy. We were even told Arasaka kept multiple copies of himself.

This ending is just a more complicated suicide. And then a copy of you gets to have a small chance of living your life in your place. 

That's horrfying to me, possibly the worst ending along with Johny taking over your brain completely
Good endings don’t need to be naively happy, but just pumping out downer endings because they’re a trend is just cynical and lazy.
Yeah. I got the ending and damn! Conflicts with your morals enough to make you consider your ideals? Now that's an ending!
F* that, ethernal shitty life all the way, screw that void and disappearing from existence.
Probably just dreams, every time you hear him you hallucinate stepping off into space and wake up.
Which ending does he still hear johnny in? Only done the Panam ending so far but they wre completely severed during that one
    on the space station between the trials
        [deleted]
            > a more fleshe

But if you join the "Save your Soul Program", don't you technically live on forever? With the slim possibility of being brought back in the future.
                [deleted]
                    also don't forget... what if Arasaka never solves the body rejection issue?  Or if you get new leadership at Arasaka that believes you are too much of a loose end to revive?  Going into Mikoshi is one of the darkest potential endings imo.
Same man. That was sad :/
Same my first ending leaves me feeling empty
If u complete panam's questline you can take Judy with u and leave the city together with panam's nomads
    I completed judy and panams questlines. but i chose for the rogue ending, when Judy called V an asshole it hurt. Gonna try again with that panam one
The thing about that for me is, the game is all "oh you can't have everything, you have to die to be a legend, blaze of glory or quiet, etc", and I'm just there like "Ok but I don't care though. Dying in a blaze of glory is still dying". Being 'just' the top merc in the city is fine by me tbh. I even told both Panam and Judy that I'd probably leave with them after I get my whole dying problem. 

"Everything I want" is living and being a top merc. I'm already the top merc (with max street cred and all) before the point of no return. So if I also get to survive (legit survive, not that 6 months bs) then I do get everything I want. Suck it you punk ass tarot symbology.
    In the line of work of a merc that dichotomy isn’t false but rather wishful because between the other outcomes 99% of the time are much worse. How many times have you reloaded before getting to street cred lvl 50? On every gig you can die and get dumped in a junkyard and forgotten.
        I mean, if I stay alive through the Arasaka deal, then I'm not going out, and I'm not exactly living quiet, cause I'm a famous merc. The theme is totes bullshit.

I didn't reload that much, but it's an RPG, saving before doing anything risky or taking important choices is how most people I know plays that kind of game.
        To be fair, once I found a shotgun with 4 mod slots it was all easy from there on.  If I really tried hard not to die to dumb shit like falling off buildings or walking on land mines I'm sure I'd manage a no deaths / no saves run.  You can get something ridiculous with the double barrel shotguns or the carnage by putting 4 crafted crunch mods on it.  Shotguns are unique in that regard because they shoot multiple pellets, all of which receive the damage bonus.  Kind of broken tbh, made the smasher fight incredibly easy.  Start one shotting everything.
Yep. There's a point at which you rendevouz with Viktor right before Hellman drives you to the Arasaka manor, and you can ask him about the boxing match he's watching. He says it's a re-run, and V asks if the loser of the match ever gets up. Viktor says no, he never does, but that's to be expected bc he picked a fight with a better opponent. 

V *is* that losing boxer who picked a fight with a bigger boxer/Arasaka and so, in most outcomes, loses/dies. Had V never gone through with the heist, he wouldn't have to get in the ring with death itself.
    I think this would have a lot more substance if not for the fact that there is an ending where V soloes the entire Arisaka tower and destabilizes the corporation such that they can openly come to power as the new king/queen/legend of Night City.
        Lol true
What I didn't like is that was the only real direction you could go in throughout the story. Hopefully they carry the story on in the near future 👍
So many people are missing this point!  You nailed it.  He literally has a cautionary tale living inside his head for 90% of the game and he never realizes it until the end.
    I think people are rightfully annoyed that they could see this coming from 100 miles away (most notably Jackie himself on the same trajectory dying tragically) and there's nothing they can do to avert this despite it being an interactive medium. Compounding this is the fact that V is not a pre-established character but is supposed to be a vessel for the player, yet the player gets railroaded into this one "Legend" motivation for V that they may not share.
I could easily imagine V becoming the next Adam Smasher. That ending feels like it was meant to be a subversion of Johnny, but it stopped short and decided on trying to make you sad for thinking you could trust Goro's plan?
    Yea bc I gave up on everyone else to gamble on the corpo ending so its really lonely bc there's only a few people you can call and hanako doesn't answer. I guess it's supposed to be a punishment for betraying everyone in a sense but I would love to see a dlc where V wakes up in a new body like in Altered Carbon, but in this, she gets the girl.
    What do you think would've happened if this was a 60 hour campaign? Do you think that could've been a turning point where V becomes adam smasher pt 2 and follows a new quest line for arasaka? On a side note, my one disappointment with the corpo life path is that you still feel like an outsider to corpos. With Meredith it isn't noticeable but when talking to maiko I think we're way out of our league and that doesn't really make much sense to me. Also I kind of wish V was japanese in that one so that she fit in with arasakas, but I realize that's a lot to wish for
yeah I get your first paragraph. If they wanted to take that angle, then they shouldn't have made so dang many happy ending side stories. half the people you meet are good, capable people who act to make the world a better place. Have your cake and eat it too.
Amen, brother. I love dark storytelling, but these endings just aren't satisfying in any way. Shit, if anything I understand Johnny's old mentality of burning the city down now. Was really hoping for an ending where we take down Arasaka, set our sights on Militech, and find a way to keep Johnny in our head but stop it from overwriting our psyche. Was it really so hard to give us an impactful ending? Why does V have to end the way he started, a loser.
    Same feelings here. If V (or Johnny) has to go out it should be with a bang that makes an impact (I was promised a burning city or at least Arasaka). Overall the endings lacked that extra oomph, the beginning and the middle of the game were much much stronger. The main story wrapped up too quickly. 

In terms of going out with a bang the space casino ending is the closest but even then without Johnny being present it feels very bittersweet (and it's just a cut scene ...for now?). You spend the entire game chasing the cure and then in the end Alt says 'no sorry actually just realized I can't help ya'. And her solution feels like an even worse Mikoshi. Another place where the loser is gonna be trapped forever but this time impossible to come back from. 

To me the relationship with Johnny was the absolute heart of the story. It really seemed like you have two main characters in the game and you get to develop them both as their fates become more and more intertwined. I'm actually surprised a lot of people seem to dislike him. I loved how rough and no bullshit (and hilarious) their interactions were. Really matched the harshness of the world. And how it could turn into a genuine friendship where both sides really developed. So I'm crushed you don't get to preserve that friendship, especially if you focus on it instead of the romantic options. 

Having to choose between one character or the other really doesn't make me want to go back because now you have this cloud hanging over you since you know what's coming.
These endings feel rushed and poorly thought out with a definite lack of AB testing with end users to gauge reactions.   There is no way for the player, who has been told his decisions and interactions matter through over 100 hours of gameplay, to make any choices at the end other than to watch everything they worked for be flushed out to a set of binary trash choices that include all the relationships they built up to be annihilated without input.  

Case in point, why the fuck make me go through all this shit with Rogue as Johnny, where choices allow you to go down a path that demonstrates Rogue has always loved Johnny and now Johnny has learned his lessons and is a reformed man ready to reciprocate; only for her to be blown away with no recourse.  I could see if you made a set of choices that were sub optimal or demonstrated that you were still the asshole Johnny then she would bite the dust but the fact there is no way to affect any of that is poor usage of the story elements and game decision making engine. 

Tag on the weird nonsense post game credit scenes that are easily catchable from a player perspective.  There is some serious Mass Effect 3 shitfuckery going on here and it makes me not want to play the game again.  Compare that to Witcher 3 or even Mass Effect 2 and you can see how there is a serious dropping of the ball here.  The entire gameplay experience is as you say "soured" and leaves me the player with a lack of desire to go back and experience all this again.
    Mass Effect 2 was such a perfect “ensemble” game, where the amount of effort you put into caring about your team mates actually decided the ending you got, and it was super rewarding. Same goes for your decisions as Geralt in TW3 and how your parental influence on Ciri and choices with Yennefer and Triss really impacted the endings and ultimate fates of those characters as well. This is sorely lacking in CP2077, sadly. The questlines for characters like Rogue, Judy, and Panam are overall very short, and it just doesn’t feel like the relationships are earned? Similarly, the endings just feel punishing and yeah, they make the rest of the story feel futile and unsatisfying.

Sad endings can be effective when well done. John Marston’s end in RDR1 felt tragic, but fitting, for example. But this... it’s just rushed and it feels like they didn’t have enough time to wrap up the story nicely after so many re-works to put all the focus on Johnny so they’d have more Keanu, and so the endings, like the lifepaths and so many other things, feel tacked-on and badly designed.
Honestly beat thing to do, or do the Paman ending 👍
    And I don’t think anything will change after we do the ending. For me, it’s no point to finish it.
Side content is where the best content in the game is imo
I really liked the change of heart in johnnys personality i mean He got his revenge on smasher and He know that from the inside arasaka is doomed due to the family conflict
One of my favorite parts of the story is Johnny Silverhand’s redemption of sorts... This ending is definitely my favorite. V gets to go out as a legend, Johnny gets another shot at life. They’ll never fade away.

But HOLY SHIT why did they have Johnny ghost all of V’s friends? Unless I’m reading into that ending wrong, it just doesn’t make much sense. The credits scenes sap all of the sweetness out of such a bittersweet ending.
Dakota says it in the Aldecado ending: you’re a bird who was dying from freezing and you try to live in an engine to get away. You’ve been dead the whole time. 

In my mind the best ending is Don’t Fear the Reaper + giving Johnny the body as you’re recognizing that you already have died and trying to hold onto life means you’re killing Johnny. Instead, have both live on in their own way.
Bruh, V dies in all of those endings. You either die and have an engram made out of you or you die and have an engram made out of you that becomes arasaka property. The only real ending where the 'original' V lives is if they decide to go back to earth to live out the rest of their life.
Really the closest thing to a good ending is "Johnny gets a second chance" I mean you can give Johnny a new lease on life or the next "happiest" ending is let V's love interest watch him essentially die from cancer over the next 6 months and pretend those would be happy times.
    [deleted]
        Definitely, that's my biggest issue with that ending entirely. I mean hell, most of them already know about the condition to begin with, how hard is it to give them some closure.
100% agree. I'm really surprised by all the people mad that there wasn't a 'good ending.' The world in the game is fucking depressing, why would you expect a good ending? The story is fascinating, it actually made me think about it afterwards, which is the first time a game made me do. And I fully agree with you - the V staying in Mikoshi is the most likely cannon ending because there's a lot of opportunities for where it could lead afterwards. Maybe Arasakas find a reason to bring him back for something? Not ruling out the Panam ending being canon though, that would give them an option of doing the same they did for blood & wine DLC for Witcher - new location
    Yea it's true, after I chose to sign the contract honestly ngl my first impressions is wow that is underwhelming but afterwards it does make you think which is pretty rare in games, most of the time after finishing a game you pretty much get over it instantly but this game makes you think even after finishing it.
        ppl are pissed, because it left a really bitter taste afterwards even if it makes you think. Noone wants to invest 50 hours into a game to get fucked in the end
            Well it's a dystopia it's no different than watching my favourite tv show and at the end of 30 episode my favourite character gets killed off. It is supposed to be depressing, hell if they added an ending that is by our standard "happy" kinda breaks the immersion of the whole fucked up world the cyberpunk universe is. A good story is one that makes the reader think the meaning behind it themselves and not spoonfed in a silver platter. 

Not saying you are wrong, I was pissed when I found out v dies in every single situation that is why I say the arasaka ending is the best one it gives V a second chance.
                I like the idea of it, but from the presentation it feels pretty clear the writers intended for it to be a bad ending.

It could have been a more cyberpunk ending if a transcendence ending happened more like the Ghost in the Shell movie. Like instead of just Johnny or just V, there's a synthesis. There was a lot of foreshadowing for synthesis but it just never happened.

IMO a real good, bad ending, could have been V becoming the next Adam Smasher, a full chrome corpo hitman. A complete subversion of what Johnny was fighting against. You become the oppressor.
                    The game has a theme of ideals being bigger than just living, and the Arasaka contract is presented like giving up your ideals to live. Even though you can roleplay through dialogue that this isn't what V wants. Jackie talked about wanting to be a Legend, with a drink named after him. I never did. I don't care. 

Even becoming an Arasaka enforcer in exchange for living wouldn't necessarily be that bad. Takemura was an alright dude. Smasher is an asshole but he was always like that, being a cyborg or a corpo didn't change him.
    I'm more of a the outcome sucks with a silver lining kinda guy. A series called shin megami tensei does this pretty well. The mainline games all have depressing ending but there are silver linings to them. The ending isn't completely bad, but it isn't completely good either. Not just completely bad.

In Shin megami tensei 4, the player only has one "good" ending and eventually the same things that happened in the game will happen again because it simply delayed the inevitable and humanity rebuilds itself only for the same thing to happen again at a time far later in history.

In the bad endings, you have law. Where you essentially cleanse all with free will and create a kingdom ruled by angels. Everyone is very happy, however they have no free will and are incapable of sinning. However because you were exposed to those with free will you were cleansed as well. And the cycle ends.

In the chaos ending you let demons wreak havoc on humanity. And it creates a world where everyone is free to do as they please. There is no fear of a tyrant ruling over them or ever taking power, because if that happens someone can come and dethrone them because might equals right in this world. And the cycle ends.

In the nihilism ending, you activate a perpetual reactor that releases all life in the universe from gods design. And there is no war, pain, hunger, or anything negative. This is because there is nothing at all left in the universe. The reactor created a black hole that erases everything from the universe. Ending the cycle once more. However in the manga, it's explained the protagonist grew to regret their actions and created realities in which he didn't exist to see what would happen.

All of these endings are pretty fucked, but they each have a silver lining and they tend to be pretty honest as long as you understand picking sides in SMT Is taking the selected ideology to the extreme because there's no other choice and it's the factions best chance at winning.

Give me a Cyberpunk ending and I'll give you a version that'd give you the SMT feeling. In SMT the endings give you a sense of satisfaction but with the knowledge of knowing you did some fucked up shit to get there and even then it's not a panacea to all your problems.
    Personally I'm not mad that the endings aren't happy, I'm annoyed that the one I picked (which I don't even consider bad anyway) just ends abruptly and doesn't give me details. It's left vague to seem deep probably but I'm just annoyed and disappointed.
For me it was more about if you do sign the contract, all the people you knew and had connections with are the one that got fucked over too. A friend, a lover, a brother, w/e type of connections you made with your various NPCs like Judy, Panam, River, etc. 

For all intents and purposes, it seems like you just "disappeared". Now that is fucked. So if your character romanced someone, well guess they won't be getting any sort of happy conclusion with them.
    Sure there's that, but you 100% die if you don't sign. So the choice is either don't lose the connections you have, have them for 6 months, then die. Or lose them now, maybe get them back later, and if not, get new ones eventually.
he's trying to steal a data bank or something.


the weird faces it shows him making as he's floating towards the palace looked like he had no oxygen or something though.
    As I understood it he basically went on a suicide mission to go out on his own terms, just like Rogue, hence the grin.
Bingo. Just the prospect of hope is what makes Panam's ending the happy one. Objectively the Illusive Man knockoff in the Path of Glory ending is probably a better path to getting some kind of treatment or cure, but in that ending V has basically totally given up on life and is just seeking more and more insane jobs to cement their legendary status. The entire portrayal of corporations in the game makes me extremely skeptical of any claims that Arisaka makes about finding you a new body, particularly when it's implied in the Path of Glroy ending that the "Save your Soul" program was not as advertised anyway (Plus going by Johnny and others' reactions trusting Arisaka is clearly the bad ending) Whereas in the Panam ending V at least expresses optimism and *hope* that they may find a way out of this once they get out of Night City.
2nd playthrough idea is what I was thinking about as well, at least for all the happier parts of the game but the endings just... not worth replaying just to have that throw into your face again that V will die. Sucks...

I went with the Nomad ending with Panam but man, even that ending is basically 'V, you are screwed no matter what, but, hey, at least your love and friends are there with ya, well, for 6 months anyway'.
As much as I wish that DLC/Expansion expands upon an ending to let you get some...more closure or golden ending or w/e people prefer to call it.

This is more likely, which is...unfortunate. The ending I got was bittersweet...but...more bitter then sweet. Great, Judy joined me with the Nomads...now she's stuck with them or all by herself after 6 months, way to go V!
Thats one way they could go but again it just feels like a waste/pointless like V says at the end. Dlc wont feel impactful if we already know the outcome
I think DLC happens after V has died and is now considered a legend in Night City personally.  My bet is on them making the Casino Heist ending canon.  We'll see if I'm right.
    Well ok but that would mean we have to start from scratch? Would be rather annoying.
        Not necessarily.  You could start at V's level that you ended in game.  There is lots of ways you could do it if you're CD Projekt Red.
Yup, just finished with that line and i dont think ive been this angry since Mass Effect 3.   Literally every choice you make is bad and to watch all that effort at trying to reconnect with Rogue only to be blown away like it was nothing....its just too much.  Reading all the other endings and post credit shit makes me even more angry.  Honestly, this is Mass Effect 3 level rage inducing.
Agreed 100%. You would think that our progress and choices during the game would heavily impact our endings, but yet, here we are.
Nah, the cyberpunk genre isn’t like that at all. I guess you never read stuff like Snow Crash, Neuromancer, or When Gravity Fails? All classics, all stories where the protagonists survive. They may not be 100% “happy” endings, but they’re not downers.
    Thank you for actually giving sources. The game could have had a satisfying ending and still be in the Cyberpunk genre. They just wanted to be cliche with dark shit and lazily end the game quickly.
The game was giving you hints that this would happen the entire way.  Even Dexter Deshawn in the first act was like "Do you want to live a quiet life or go out in a Blaze of Glory?"  If V had chosen a quiet life there would be no game.  He was never going to make it out.
    That's a pretty bad false dichotomy though. Lots of people die quietly and there's no good reason you couldn't live in a blaze of glory.
        Considering blaze of glory means you die swinging, how would one live in a blaze of glory? That doesn't make sense.
            I mean like, if your life is being the top edgerunner it might not be as spectacular as soloing a private army and blowing a top secret basé but it's not exactly a quiet life either.
But that’s what pisses me off so much about the story. No matter what, all endings seem to indicate v was fucked from the moment he stepped foot in Night City. The fact that most of us who got to the end of the game and expect DLC to finish telling us how the story ends is lazy storytelling.
>the arasaka soul well

I wouldn't call that a good ending since it feels to me like they are trying to bullshit you. Compatibility issues? Didn't stop johnny to take over your body too so why is that suddenly an issue for them? Signing away all rights as well? I doubt V sees another day in his life
    Well it looks like if you aren't compatible the process changes your DNA and you will die.
    I think the arasaka soul was the probably the best outcome for him to live on. I doubt they tried to bullshit ya cause takemura (you can save him from the apartment) Really seems convincing and promises he will find another body and that when he gets another one takemura promises to take him around Japan.
I doubt thats when V is the happiest. It seems like Nomads is the happiest, bc if you romanced someone, they come with you instead of you being alone staying at the afterlife for 6 months and dying.
There wasn't just one story arc though. As someone that started Nomad and got the Panam ending (and I romanced her), it felt too perfect for it not to be canon ending.


But I bet rogue's ending would fit better with a streetkid. I havent played it, but I'm guessing the ''I want to be a legend'' bit will be more played out there, since in the nomad path the game focus a lot on how V's lonely and how worse it got with Jackies death. So in one he becauses a legend by planning an heist on a spacestation, while the other he finds a family. Plus, Johnny ends up together with Alt in cyberspace which in a way, is also pretty cool.


I have no idea how the corpo arc would flesh out though lol
Never Fade Away (Samurai Cover)
I think around 6 endings tbh.
This happens as panams love interest too. She says i dont think il make it back to camp tonight, tough being the chief and it sucks they havent seen each other as much but she’ll make it up to him, then she says bye sand storm is coming. 

So i guess they r still together but she goes out for work or something since shes the chief. Mitchs msg also comes up so it makes no sense
I think they probably will create a DLC to explore this ending. Seeing as the other endings did not really have a way to continue on without massive changes other than the ending in which Johnny Silverhand keeps the body. Since keeping Keanu Reeves on a payroll would probably leave them broke pretty fast, I don't think they'll go down that route. CDPR really spent a lot on this game, I think they'll want to keep the main character alive, despite him not being as iconic as, say, Geralt or Shepard.

Edit: Plus the Panam ending just feels more polished and more thought through as if somebody put more effort into it. Can't hide bias, whatever will later be used should logically get more attention. My gut is almost never wrong about these.
    > Plus the Panam ending just feels more polished and more thought through

Which is weird considering triggering it is kinda random in a way as a StreetKid. Johnny and Rogue are part of your path more frequently and more organically than Panam, who you only meet once and never again (unless you go out of your way to do her side quests)... 

However, Panam offers a more satisfying ending. Before tonight I was set at going the Rogue/Johnny way, but now that I know about how open and optimistic Panam’s ending are, I’ll just change route and call the Nomads. Still feel weird and unnatural, but at least I will get something somewhat satisfying out of it.
        > (unless you go out of your way to do her side quests)...

If you don't - you should not get the option of this ending, that would make no sense.
            I mean, I get that, but my point is that in order to get a somewhat hopeful ending you have to abandon the main organic narrative and do *her* sidequest, despite the fact you barely hear/see her again after her branch in the main story.
                All the "character-arc" sidequests are like that. For Judy, River, Panam.. hell, even the one for Johnny. Or the one for Jackie's funeral.  It is a question of friendship - if you consider that character someone worthwhile, a friend - you take time to do them. For me it was pretty organic, especially considering Panam as romance option.
                That’s one way to view it. But you could also say that Johnny and Rogue represent the trap of Night City, they’re legends in their own right and you can become one too... but look at the cost they paid. And Jackie paid. And every street kid pays pursuing that goal. 

Choosing the Nomads IS a bit random, because it’s you breaking that cycle. Potentially for the better.
        Very late to the party, but to me I thought the most thematically appropriate ending was Johnny leading a new raid of Arisaka tower, only this time he's not doing it to destroy or to fulfill some ill-defined grab for glory, but to save V (and for my headcanon nomad V, it was also appropriate that possibly their final act would be to put their complete faith in another to save their life). And I thought that mission was awesome! Looking forward to replaying the game with Male V so I can romance Panam and get my "happy" ending, if we want to call it that.
            I understand what you're saying but i disagree with your assetment of the game's theme. This wasnt Johnny's story, it was V's. Leaving the soul sucking corporate Night City for the road with Panam feels more like canon.
                Depends on how you view the story - Is it a redemption arc in which V learns it's not about where you end up, but the people you love (Nomad ending)? Or is it a rags to riches story where V finally, and at a great cost, becomes the greatest merc in all of night city?
                    Yeah, it depends. The rags to riches is pushed heavily. The whole reason was to become the king of Night City. 

After it sucks you up and spits you out though, I like the redemption/nomad arc.
                        
Interesting - I tried both endings as of yesterday and I strongly feel the rags to riches ending felt better. I barely wanted to finish the nomad ending for my street kid V who wanted to be a legend. I think it purely depends on what WE want for our Vs!
                We are in agreement, I was referring specifically to the quest itself.
        You can totally make it work for a streetkid I think, it's what I did and I just saw it as my V was sick of the city and the pain it's brought and was enjoying living the nomad life on his jobs with Panam so decided fuck it, nomad life let's go
            Makes sense cuz in the beginning the street kid went to Atlanta hoping it was better than NC. After being burned by the city life, it’d make sense to go nomad.
        wanna give my opinion on your post to just make you feel a bit more comfortable with choosing panam... If we take references from films and series, 

altered carbon takeshi started somewhat "corpo" being in the army and ended up with a group of rebels.

oblivion, jack harper started from "corpo" but ended up rebel.

Luke skywalker, scrapper/tinkerer.

Elisium almost has that same ending feel where they gang up to take down the big shots.

some more but I dont wanna think anymore and you get  the idea. Nomads are the nearest we can get to rebels in the game (with the exception of silverhand and his chooms. that was 50 years ago)
    [deleted]
        I don't think Kerry gets ghosted? If you are in a relationship with Kerry and choose the nomad ending, Kerry shows up to the camp in a taxi shortly before you leave and breaks up with you. Now that was a gut punch for me. All those people you got killed by asking the nomads for help, and your boyfriend doesn't even leave with you.
            Kerry has a real life and a career outside of you. River has his family. It makes sense that neither of them drop their whole everything to come on your escape, just like it makes sense for Judy to quit Night City and leave with you.

I don't see how it's a stab at the Aldecaldos that neither Kerry or River come with you; they're not the nomad's family. You are.
                Never said it was a stab at the Aldecaldos, I said it was a gut punch to me, because I'd grown to like Kerry and his relationship with V during my playthrough, I was sad that I had to leave him behind.
                Which is why the female V with Judy in the Panam ending is the best to me - it gets the most good people out of NC and happy.
            I'm so pissed about this ending. It doesn't feel like the good ending everyone said it was. Your boyfriend leaves you and you get a bunch of good people killed, all so you can live 6 months more. Honestly wtf? I was somehow happy with the game despite the bugs but this has left a bad taste in my mouth I can't shake. I even felt a strong emotional/ friendship connection to Panam, but still. Ugh.

Edit: extra words
    Could as easily explore the arasaka ending though. The one where you can sign a contract. Maybe they find a way to give v a new body. Seeing as this is one of the default endings it's way more likely to be explored in the future.
        There would be no Johnny Silverhand then, which would be a bummer. The main character, V, was not really that Iconic or memorable. Johnny Silverhand compensated for that. Without Silverhand, I think the game would lose its cool factor. That's why I initially thought Arasaka ending would not be explored. Also, whether you choose Mikoshi or Earth is important. They cant possibly explore both, it's vastly different. Nomad ending only has one option and that is to leave Night City. If you give the body to Johnny, he also leaves Night City, which, in my mind, indicates that they want to explore other cities or states maybe due to the creative freedom it will provide. Night City is well-defined but other cities or states are less so.
    What about blue eyes man? That ending has too many unknowns and sometimes frightens me. I doubt V is alone to kill all the corpo owners and rich people.
I just enjoy cruising through Night City, collecting things, doing random events that seem to infinitely pop up from time to time, I am basically living in Night City.
    Lmao tell me about it, have so much fun just roaming around, running off a laptop with a 2080 maxq atm so can't wait for my pc parts to play it at a decent frame rate, what are you rocking hardware wise?
        Love to see that people are actually enjoying the story and this game. This sub feels so toxic to be on. Feels like there is no place to be enthausiastic about this game. This game really gripped me for it's storytelling and people you meet, but so many people wanted so much different things from this game. Everyone had their idea of cyberpunk in their head before the game launched, but there is only one version of it. Without bugs and some fixing of AI perhaps this game should be ready for a lot of good story DLC. Hope to see the pan am ending expanded as she is one of the characters and stories I ended up caring for the most. Best written of the characters and side quests IMO. Was really happy to find out there was a somewhat happy ending for her.

Can I just say I love Misty, like not in a romantic way, as she was with Jackie, but like a great woman who would give you a hug if you needed one in a hard time, she really is so sweet, and pure.
    Totally agree with you, she's always there to comfort and support you. Great character.
    Totally misty reminds me of Mayuri from steins gate tbh
That part was the icing on the cake for that ending. I tried the Rogue ending before I went with Panam, because I was scared of her dying, but the ending choices for that one made me so mad I almost decided to stop playing for good. I went back and did the one with her and I'm loving the game again
 🔥
    Yeah I felt a similar way going with the rogue one, I didn't go with Panam because I felt like I didn't want to risk her life, or the nomads. I might do that my next PT because I'm mad that I also left Takemura behind, and I didn't know you could go back for him. The guy was one of my favorite characters too. 

I also don't mind sad endings, I mean I loved RDR2's, its a gem. But what i got felt like there was no resolution, and in fact my character's life worsened in quality with River.
        Little late but 100% agreed. I legit didn't know you could go back for Takemura. An optional objective didn't show up so I thought he was gone. Only found out a little bit later after looking up some of the missions online. Really made me sad since, like you said, he was one of my favorites too. If there's at least one thing CDPR did right, it's the fuckin characters. I honestly think I can say I like pretty much every single one of them.
            the characters were nice. I think River needed more to his questlines, but hes still likeable. I didn't think I'd like everyone as much as I did, so I agree. The story line itself is good too. Only wished for some finer details in some areas, but hopefully if they do a dlc it will expand on the characters we got attached to.
                Yeah River was my first romance of the bunch, figured I'd do separate playthroughs with the others later. He's honestly pretty cool, and I'd argue his side job quest line was both quite disturbing and also very well done. Probably one of my favorites. Panam's questline was definitely quite fun too, and the first time I got to test run the Basilisk, I got pretty hype lol. Sadly, I didn't finish up all of Judy's before I beat the game, but I'll probably just go back before the endgame sequence and wait out a day to finish. She seems pretty cool too.

That's definitely something I hope they do as well: flesh out the romance options/characters more. Gonna be a while before we get DLC though, I imagine. I'm okay with that.
                    I thought there'd be a little more to River's questlines, they were well done. I agree, but by doing two things with him he calls about missing V, which i don't think is fully justified since they barely know eachother, where as Panam and Judy do have longer sequences before the romance scenes. I do like the dynamic between the cop angle and a law breaking merc. I wish they played with that a little more. 

It would be cool to have new romances as well, given i guess some can break it off with you depending on what ending you go with. It'll be interesting how they tie everything together.
            I did the Panam ending and on the end credit scene, Takemura San told me to go to hell. I saved him and all. Anyone got this too?
    Do sad endings make you not like the story?
        Garbage endings make me not like the story. 🤷‍♂️  Especially in games where post story dlc could be easily doable.  Fallout 3 was probably the only game that fixed their ending with dlc.
            Sad endings aren't necessarily garbage though. The first ending I tried was the suicide one and... it's probably the worst but it was quite powerful and well made. Its message might seem quite obvious but it's one that is always good to remember: suicide is not difficult for the one committing it... it's hard for the ones left behind and that have to keep on living (which is paradoxical because V choses this end because it's the "least bloody"... except he/she didn't factor in the pain and despair).
I played through all of the endings, and the one with Panam was by far the best, and the one that just feels right with the story. Going off of Mistys card readings in the credits I feel like it will work out for V.
    I played through all the endings too, i noticed that when Misty was reading the cards to you, the only good one was with Panam and every other ending besides Panam's was a bad card reading. I think Panam's ending is canon, just feels like they've done more work into her ending then another. I really hope that Panam's ending is canon.
        I feel the same. It definitely should be the canon ending considering the others were just hollow in comparison.
            Yeah all the other endings just felt depressing, but Panam's ending actually felt good, it gave me hope about V's survival. But yeah again i really hope this ending is canon
        Panam's ending is the only one that has V taking full control of herself and her destiny. In the other endings, she hands over control to someone else, be it Johnny or Arasaka. In that way, the game's theme is for self-actualisation, as V is only rewarded for bringing herself out of the mess she's in.
            not necessarily. [you missed an ending.](https://youtu.be/UIi-Ufnvkg0?t=144) :)

spoilers, obviously. >!this ending is insanely difficult. i came in with my overpowered build at level 44 doing 10,000+ damage per bullet with a smart SMG and had to crank the difficulty down to easy to pull it off. the enemies are bullet sponges who will 1-2 shot you depending on build and if you die during it, counts as the suicide ending and rolls credits, meaning you have to give up or redo the whole ending sequence up to that point. balls hard challenge run.!<
        She gives you a good reading on the Path of Glory ending too, at least if you do the solo mission. I still liked Panam's ending better though.
        I think all the endings suck in some way still. If you go with Panam then Johnny ends up merging with Alt.
its also the only ending you can actually stay with Judy if you romance her. Otherwise, she'll just put an end to your relationship
I did the don't fear the reaper ending and find it so silly that V can't leave the city after the solo raid on Mikoshi. Panam wouldn't be so busy that she has to keep blowing off your plans if Saul was still alive.
I agree with the overall impression but is the Panam romance available to non-male characters? Can hardly be canon otherwise. I wouldn't even be certain CDPR ever says which one is canon, as a matter of fact.
    You don't need to romance her for the ending.  As female V my lovely Judy left with us.
        Ah, that's great, thanks for clearing that up.
        Really cool. As male V romancing Panam and  being friend with Judy, she sends a message and it's obvious she's on the road (outdoors, maybe by a camp fire) and says that leaving NC is the best choice.
    Can only romance Panam if your a male. The ending for Panam just feels more thought of or something like they put more time into the ending. Hope it's canon man
I think that the panam ending is actually the Canon one. More. Like it at least because u have time left. To find a cure and I think it's the only ending that could possibly have a nice dlc for it To continue. All the other endings are just kinda sad and done for so I think the panam one is the most Canon likely.
“dlc where you maybe go to Arizona and someone or something can save you from death”

That would make a good transition to the sequel.(or whatever the online game ends up being)

2078 - where are saved but lose all your abilities As your body rejects it’s self.(hurray for skill resets in sequels)

I don’t know what the plot would be but there is a lot of room for things to happen. 

Possible plot lines-
Blackwall/AI might be loose thanks to you helping Alt. 

There is seems to be a war coming but it was just mentioned in the background.
mr blue eyes is maybe also tied to the organisation that brainwashed peralez
I was very disappointed that I didnt get to play out the space walk and continue. Feel like this should have played out.
...wut?
    That's a Johnny Silverhand line.
        Oh 😂😂😂 I was like "well that escalated quickly."
            I felt the confusion in your comment xD
                I was like that went from 0-100 so fast I got whiplash 😂
                    Yeah johnny is edgy.
Alt didn't take a number of things into consideration, so things it says shouldnt be considered absolute, even at the end.

In fact, I think Alt has a vested interest in Johnny getting the body and her getting V's engram
Agreed, it feels so much better in skyrim for example when you end the game and come back and people remember what you did and their parts in the ending. Was much more satisfying imo. This one just leaves me lost on where to go from there
    find the secret ending ;)
        Isn't secret ending the "blaze of glory" one
            definitely not coming back as V from that ending.


just did this ending last night and felt like an asshole lol
                Ya both Jude and panam leaves u, while the male ones actually stay in the ending (vice versa if it's the panam ending)
                    spoilers

&#x200B;

Jude and panam left me, I did the finish with arkasia - but seems they were done with me way before then, even after finishing their stories
                        Ya no one likes the arisaka ending
                    for me, i had no relationships and never finished panam/judy storyline.


they both left messages in the credits asking me to call them sometime but acted like i was too busy/famous for them now.


dunno if the credit messages change depending on relations.

                            > because they all said something like "Ah, voice mail again

I got the ending with Panam and only Rogue said that in the credits
                        Well you are among the top dogs in blaze of glory ending, plus might be super busy bcoz of the casino lmao.
            isnt dont fear the reaper the secret one?
                Ya I think so, bcoz u literally walk in the front door and nobody dies
I always hate when open world games does this. Like, I went through hell only to... never have the satisfaction of *being* in a game with my accomplishment done? This is so backward.

Horizon did this. Breath of the Wild did this. Shadow of the Tomb Raider also.

Like, just let me free roam Night City with a freed, breathing and non-dying V, FFS. As it stand I would be doing side quests and free roam knowing my character is slowly dying anyway.
    Yeah I felt the story build really well because you have a constant motivation to be cured.... But as soon as you get "cured" it's game over and you have to go back to dying again. Spending all your time while you're dying doing odd jobs for random people feels out of character for V to be doing lol
    Ff15 did the same thing and it was the worst. Though I accept the Panam ending and thought it was great, I really wish they didnt have to leave. Maybe that ending will be the true ending and we'll get some return to NC dlc, lol.
    RDR2 as well. Seriously enough with this shit.
    Completely get what you're saying but this is where the medium is at odds with its neo-noir setting. From a player satisfaction perspective, you'd always want to give players the choice of continuing to experience the world after the story is over. But the game exists primarily to tell this story, and that sense of dread and urgency are a huge part of the atmosphere.

In other words: wait for mods, or invest in a PC and then wait for mods.
    That would be cool. But for some games like Horizon, it would be basically two different maps before and after the story. So the devs would have to work twice to make it good. Probably would’ve made the game launch way later or more probably would split the team on the both maps and then they would be only half as good.
Yeah man agreed
Nah man its been done with many games to a very successful degree, you can look at skyrim as a massively popular game that pulled it off
I feel like an issue that is raised though is how DLC is going to handle the different endings. I haven’t finished the game yet, mind you, but I mean it sounds like in a lot of cases >!either V or Johnny end up in cyberspace or whatever depending on the player’s choice, so not everyone is going to have a V to play as in the DLC.!< Plus, I heard there’s an ending where >!both V and Johnny decide to end their lives on their own terms, meaning that they’d have no one at all to play as.!< 

I guess I’m just curious to know if the DLC will fix the problems that come along with the endings or if it’ll be something totally different where we play as a different character or something. Or maybe as Johnny in the past.
    In Witcher 3, the bad ending wasn't considered "canon" so they just based it off of the other ones and left it a little vague.

I'm actually wondering if they have a dlc planned that is all about picking up with months left to live and finding a cure, because it seems so odd that they would force V to be in that same circumstance no matter what happens. All you can really influence is V's attitude and methods, but V's circumstance is very similar in all of the ones where they live.

That spacewalk shit was stupid though.
        I think it’d be cool if they somehow worked the ending people chose into it, for sure. Like I know it’s unrealistic, but I chose >!to let Johnny take V’s body for a reason.!< To be told that my intentional ending doesn’t actually exist would suck. I imagine if someone got Ciri killed in the Witcher it was an accident (although anything is possible.) I picked >!Johnny over V because my V cared about him, would take a bullet for him, and realized that he could have a whole life while she would only get another 6 months.!< 

If they could tweak the storyline you mentioned so that Johnny >!in V’s body!< is trying to find a way to >!get ahold of new bodies and save V from behind the black wall or whatever!< it would be ideal for me. 

Of course that doesn’t solve the issue of the >!suicide!< ending but that one seems hard to come back from.
    I get what you mean but a Johnny DLC would be cool.
        It definitely would and it would work well since it would take place pre-game. 

I’m just wondering if and how the dlc’s can expand on the main story of the game since the endings would make it difficult.
            Yeah, unless they make a different path for each ending in a dlc, it would be a lot of effort for an expansion. Or they make one ending canon but then that would make every other ending kinda pointless. Although I would love to see a continuation of the main story but I think if anything they’ll do a new story with a different main character.
                Making one ending canon makes sense imo. The Panam ending is the "good" ending, and the only one with any real hope. Almost all other endings leads to the death of V.

Same situation if you give Johnny your body. It's no longer V in there, it's not "us". 

So yeah, the nomads ending seems to be the only ending with the possibility to branch out.
                    Well it might be possible that V survives the space casino heist
                        space casino V gave up on a cure. They live only to become the legend that will last.

Id say that Nomad ending and Arasaka ending (version where you go back to earth) are only ones that actually puts a way to find any cure.
                            But blue eyes is like, if u succeed, then he could provide a cure???
                    Sorry, to chime in on an old thread but man... Those endings do not leave much hope for any sort of decent DLC continuing the story.

Making one ending "canon" completely removes player agency from the endings. I don't think the endings were very strong either.
                        Yup, the endings were weak AF.  Especially if you chose to identify with Johnny.  They strip the player of all agency in the Rogue mission option, which is garbage. They give you all the agency to try and patch things up with Rogue with conversation points and decisions that lead you to a point in the mission where her and Johnny agree to start fresh together then bam! It ignores all the effort you put in up to that point and does not make use of any decision points from prior.  Hell, Mass Effect 2 and Witcher 3 allowed all these things and its strange how CDPR chose to take this weird route where they give you all this agency only to strip it away right at the end.
                Yeah it’s a tough situation because dropping people’s endings could cause even more drama, but one canon ending or a new story in the same world would make the most sense.

Either way I’m hoping for a continuation of my ending that results in a happy ending for both V and Johnny. Unrealistic, sure, but it’s my hope lol.
                    My hope is that they go back to fix the endings for Johnny so that Rogue doesnt get fragged or at least put in some method where your conversation decisions/skills allow you to interrupt Smasher's sequence.  Huge missed opportunity there and really sours the game for me so much so that it makes replaying it in the current state unpalatable.
    You can easily do it just by telling players that the DLC is accessible if you achieved X,Y, or Z ending, and not on the other options.  It's not like anyone would be locked out, because the game saves automatically before talking to Hanako and takes you back to there if you choose to keepin playing.

So you could easily have the DLC be accessible for any of the "6 months to live" endings.
    \[spoilers for Mass Effect and Fallout\]  


 imagine it'll be like Mass Effect 3, where it was possible to have a canon ending to your mission back in Mass Effect 2, but if you play 3 it's assumed you're branching from a different point  


Or like in Fallout 3, where if you get the DLC you survive your sacrifice
arguably a branch where you'd be just allowed to live; a "happy end", would go against many of the things this game sets forward. The World is dystopic, there are no happy ends, just degree's of bad and at least on my part I felt sort of empty and sad so its done its job messing with my feelings. Also think that's intentional.
    While I don't disagree that Night City is a dystopia, the game is full of moments and characters that constantly reinforce the idea that there are bonds and ideals that the corporations cannot crush. Nothing about Jackie or his family is dystopian, Johnny's bond with Rogue persists after 50 years, Panam and the Aldocaldos are repeatedly depicted as a tight bond outside the corporate structure, V can choose to be merciful in several major moments, Viktor and Misty are objectively good people, and so on. There are many good endings to stories in Night City (or at least, positive endings to certain chapters), so to say to the player that no matter what they do they're fucked takes away from a large part of what the game has said over the last (in my case) 50 hours.
        Yup, they give you agency to be a good person with reinforcing mechanisms around you from Jackie/Misty to Johnny/Rogue to V/love interest.  After 90 hours of playtime where they build you up with hope to then suddenly tear it away at every option was just not good.  I identified with Johnny through my play through and even got the bond with V pretty high so towards the point of no return i went through the heart wrenching goodbyes to Panam and then played as Johnny.  Throughout the entire mission it gives you hope that, even after 50 years, shes still in love with you as you are with her.  Right at the point where your character and her decide to start fresh everything gets smashed.  At that point, none of your choices matter and every end point is just a depressing mess.  Reading about the other endings makes it all the more depressing.

This is starting to feel like those "subverting expectations" style writing courses they try to do and the story just slaps you down hard no matter what.  Makes replayability very low as there is virtually no good outcome. Like honestly, how is Mass Effect 2 still the gold standard on this stuff after so long???  The game gave you agency to bond with characters and affect their end game while so many games continue to do this all or nothing stuff.  

I should have been able to save Rogue during the final assault instead of watching her die and in the end being Johnny where everyone i know or knew is dead is just not a good way to run a story for which you want a person to assume the identity for.
        It's the thing that I got from it. Yeah the corps' greed are squeezing whatever they can from the environment and don't care if they grind everyone into dust in the process, but they haven't. With all their power and might and tech people are still people. As utterly terrifying as Night City is there is still beauty in it, people still find beauty in it that doesn't revolve around the kill or be kill mentality.

The fact that every ending is damn near kicking your feet out from under you and laughing at you for thinking that has really left a sour taste in my mouth. Got 3 of the 5 ending sequences and uninstalled. Might come back to it in a year when as much of the stuff is fixed as possible but for now think I'm done.
    there's a happy end for literally all of the people you choose to spend time with.

so....CDR is doing a have your cake and eat it too moment. Like Viktor Vektor? Heck, just be nice to him. He's happy and your friend. Like Panam? Fuck it, go shoot shit up with her. Like Judy? Be there for her. Any1 u like you can get a happy ending for. Except yourself. Oh and except Jackie. And that's supposed to teach you some deep lesson about the dark world of CyBeRpUnK. 

The thing isn't even internally consistent.
    > arguably a branch where you'd be just allowed to live; a "happy end"

Not dying is not a happy ending. A happy ending would be you make so much money that you can retire rich and young, kinda like GTAV.

I was hoping V could live to fight another day. You can tell whoever wrote the endings in no way shape or form played the game except maybe a couple hours.
    No matter what, I experienced a hard to forget story and moved by it a lot, connected with the very well made side characters and amazed by the story of the game, even if it messed with my feelings like you said.

I'm happy with endings actually, it wouldn't feel organic and realistic this much if V wouldn't have been dying no matter what. I'm on the same page with you.

Edit: As for the sequel, I hope they create a new character, maybe tying it with V in the event chain of history somehow. I really hope they don't pull an unrealistic and hard to believe trick to bring V back. Things that can't be done by Arasaka or Alt, also shouldn't be available to Mr. Blue Eyes.
    How is it dystopic when the game offers to give the body to johnny, who gets to live? In every scenario V is the only one who gets absolutely fucked, even Johnny can live if the player chooses to.
        Johnny taking over your body and leaving the city is essentially the most positive ending, V doesn’t suffer anymore and Johnny is essentially redeemed of his douchey old ways and he moves on...
    They can still do this ending... While letting you continue to play the game after  it's done... I mean it just seems like they had to shove this thing out the door.
    It’s a game, it meant to be make people happy and plus it’s not like we are asking let that be the ONLY ending, you still have many choices. 

They just tucked up the story like what TLOU2 did
You would give it a bad review for not having a happy ending?
    Yeah i don’t understand where a lot of these people are coming from either. Not all stories have happy endings, and V is in a pretty damn rough spot to begin with. There are hints throughout the game that things in Night City rarely end well, and V’s story goes along perfectly for that
V dies in 6 months no matter what you do for this ending.
    technically he's going to die, no reason in a DLC they couldn't find some miracle ripperdoc who can fix V or some other bullshit cure from a Corp.
        I highly doubt that DLC's will extend/explain the endings. It's most likely gonna be something like Johnny DLC or V/Jackie old days DLC.
            I don't think they'd do that tbh. I feel like any DLC might even be a separate character at this point. Pretty stupid way to end the game IMO. The problem with multiple choice endings is a DLC continuing them would most likely invalidate some of the endings... Which is I've always hated in RPGs. 

It removes player choice.
                Use your imagination Choom,  think about how the game ended it branches out in the end with the Major choices, but more or less the same outcome. 

DLC could start branched out as well.

Here how I would like to see it:
1. you load up the Brand new DLC
2. A prompt pops up and asks you what Ending you chose.
3.You choose and the game starts a a Short Prologue basically on whatever you chose but will braid your "Past" into more Linear Story DLC.

You know, like the Lifepath thing at the start, nomad, Streetkid , Corpo.. you started differently but ended up meeting Jackie, took Dexs Job, etc.etc. 

That's how this could work, but.. not every ending, like Jonny taking over wouldn't work for my Theory or possibly the Arasaka ending (? Havent played that one yet ,so please no spoilers)

In which case I would see that they would pull the same thing they did on the Blood and Wine DLC where only the "good" endings will be Cannon.

Also because I doubt they will get Keanu Reeves to Voice Jonny for a whole freaking DLC "Branch" probably expensive  as hell.
                    Before you meet Hanako you get a call, to save your life and continue living, by doing so you get none of the shit ass gonk endings, canon af bruh. I will direct it 100% choom, its gonna be preem.
                    >Use your imagination Choom,  think about how the game ended it branches out in the end with the Major choices, but more or less the same outcome.

So it either means that the developers have to pick an ending to be canon. Which is fucking stupid in an open ended game. Might as well not allowed for multiple endings at all in that case. Removes all player agency from the main story. Which was my point.

or

It means they have to craft some sort of DLC that incorporates all of the endings... Including the ones where Johnny takes over V's body and leaves the city. Which seems nigh impossible especially for CDprojectRed to handle correctly.

&#x200B;

I don't think they "can't" do it. I just think the endings are varied enough that they may go with Option 1. Which is super lame.
                        Well I would guess that some endings would be disabled , as I said I doubt they would get Keanu into this game again expect for maybe a couple of one liners.

So I would assume that some endings are considered .. bad endings which wouldn't progress into a Story DLC.. just like the suicide one.

But the main endings , Night City Afterlife Boss and the Nomad one could very definitely be continued which like I said would simply branch out at the beginning only to twirl into a linear story just like the beginning of the game , and if you think about it, there are only 3 endings which would make sense to continue on Nomad, Afterlife Boss, and Return from the Arasaka Space station..
    You dont know that. Its pretty clearly, and intentionally, open ended. Probably so they have something to use for sequels/dlc.
        I mean Alt that fucking AI told us so and that shit is probably the smartest thing around in the Cyberpunk universe and if you pick the Arasaka ending the smartest brains in Arasaka reached the same conclusion so I don't really see how V can be saved if the best possible candidates for saving her life were both pretty  set on her dying in 6 months.

But there is to hoping I guess.
            That kinda ruined the game for me. I reached the point of no return tonight and upon reading about it I ended being spoiled by the whole ending. No hard feelings though, but during my playthrough I was hard focused on the main quest as I wanted to save V and save her life ASAP since this was obviously an urgency, I would then focus on the other content afterward.

Turns out that not only its a lost cause, but I'm thrown back pre point of no return after the end anyway. Which condemn me to forever be stuck with an AI slowly killing V in all my future playthrough/free roam sessions.

It sucks.
                Yup I feel you hard, exactly how I played my V and I want to feel like all my work to cure V meant something. I wanna be in night city not as someone slowly dying so I don't feel weird doing all this side content that just feels out of place for V to be doing
                    This reminds me we’ll forever be plagged by the random OLD RELIC MALFUNCTION condition until the end of time since we never truly get rid of that.

Best design decision ever lol
                >Turns out that not only its a lost cause, but I'm thrown back pre point of no return after the end anyway. Which condemn me to forever be stuck with an AI slowly killing V in all my future playthrough/free roam sessions.  
>  
>It sucks.

100% this. I played a game a similar way until I got to the point of no return. Then I did all the side content but like... Most of it felt super frivolous. Let me go scuba diving while this AI is frying my mind... It doesn't make sense narratively.

I was hoping, like you, for an ending that would allow me to re-enter the world and do all the side shit after finishing the main story. But it's all tied to Johnny, which was a mistake, so I understand why they did it the way the did... CDPR has a problem with story writing this way. Witcher 3 had similar problems.
            Alt isn't the smartest thing though, she said it herself. She can't use soulkiller to its fullest capabilities after all the Arasaka changes.


Also, best candidates yet. Remember there are private networks like the voodoo boys that netwatch is trying to control. Plus, a whole unexplored world.
            Super late to the party but I would note that Alt is very deliberately *not* depicted as omniscient or flawless (She has to wipe out the Voodoo boys to save herself from Netwatch if you trust the Netwatch agent, she says she's been trying and failing to breach Mikoshi for 50 years, she obviously screws up V's diagnosis (assuming Alt wasn't lying, which we have no reason to think she was)). 

In the Arisaka ending Hellman analogizes what has happened to V as similar to the damage inflicted by radiation poisoning, but tbh that line was reasonably comforting to me: It's the year 2077 and you're telling me no one anywhere has figured out radiation poisoning, not even to mitigate it?? 

Beyond that, the reason people like the Panam ending is that it is the only ending that is geared towards leaving the player with hop: Hope for a cure, but also (and separately) hope for an escape from the dystopia they have been living in for the last 20-60 hours. I would have lived to see more ambiguity, or just flat out more hope, from the other ostensibly legitimate and good endings.
                How tf can adam smasher live looking like he does but V cant lol, there has to be a way.
                    Adam's basically a complete cyber body, which is sort of why the Arisaka endings don't bother me. 

Assuming that at some point they will get the risks of a fully cyber body down to a tolerable level, then getting engram'd and then stuffed in a cyberframe later on is fine.
                        One of the side missions suggests editing engrams is possible. Wouldn’t want to emerge as diet V in a new body with all negative tendencies eliminated (as defined by Arasaka).
        You die no matter what. As soon as you enter mikoshi alt uses soulkiller on you and creates an engram, a copy of you. Is a copy of you really you? What makes you you?
    Damn thats kind of disappointing. I wonder what they might do for expansions then.
        Could be another protagonists story. I like to think that V was our introduction into the CP77 universe; or it could be early / mid-game expansions + possibly new endings who knows.
            Another protag will make all of cyberpunk feel so wasted though.. like u make ur own char, ur own choices and relationships and now u gotta make a new protag? Nah, i hope not
                What's wrong with telling multiple stories in Night city? V became a Legend, would be interesting to hear about them and maybe run into old friends time to time while you make new ones

I really liked how Gta4 did this with it's DLC, same world different stories
                    Well for gta4 we still got a definitive ending for Niko, there are way too many loose ends for cyberpunk.

2. Im ok playing with another character for a sequel. The story for V seems unfinished and the devs possibly made it so open-ended for reason.
            i'm betting that they will just be addtional quests in the world, so you need to load a save before the final mission anyway.
                I feel like the story was created to make the multiplayer have respawning in the lore. I feel like the DLC will also incorporate the immortality factor after Arisaka discovers the chip works.
                    Not like the cloning vats haven't been a thing in other major cyberpunk fiction. Cyberpunk is a perfect precursor to worlds like altered carbon.
    Not necessarily, he has about 6 months to live but nothing says he can't find a cure in that time. The end credits could imply that he's dead and therefore can't answer. But on the all along the watchtower mission you can talk with cassidy and his dialogue gives me major vibes that V doesn't die, as long as you don't think he will and think that you will survive. That it's all about outlook.  
Realistically it doesn't look great for V but you never know.
        Yup got the same vibe. Got the same feeling at the end of MGS when Snake gets Fox Die and Naomi says there is no way to know when he will die and he just has to live (and he does, for quite a while). Plus there are several Kojima references in the game.
    One of the endings hints that Delamain might be able to help V. 

&#x200B;

I think the "cure" will still come in the form of some AI related bullshit. 

&#x200B;

I'll say I'm disappointed in the endgame in general. The endgame felt rushed much like the latter 1/3 of the Witcher 3 felt empty.
He doesn't. Im guessing they're saving up this ending for a possible sequel/dlc in search of a cure.
    Yea that was my thought at first too.
I'll just wait for mods. Then V lives. lol.
    Step 1 of grief:Denial
fuuuuuuucking PREACH.

Just another incomplete game. A little hole they didn't patch.

Actually...can you do the voodoo thing at all? Guess they just ran out of time or whatever.

:/ why is every game I play like this? It always ends with a great plan (either mentioned and forgotten, or something obvious never mentioned) being completely overwritten by a bunch of shit someone 'clever' threw up? OoOoOoO NiGhT cItY sTeAlS yOuR IdEnTiTy.

nah bitch. I beat night city. And if the game had let me give Jacquito any one of the 112 medi-injector things in my pocket, we woulda beat it together.

I think you can beat life too. But nah, every fucking artist out there wants to force me to fail to teach me some life lesson they just figured out.

Been through those failures. Learned from them. Changed. But in the long run? The real lesson is: don't waste your time sticking around in failure.
How do you get that ending?
    You need 70% you only live once. And then when you have to chose how to raid the tower you select the johnny and rouge one and sit there for a few minutes. From what I can tell to get 70% all you have to do is do all the johnny side quests and when your at where he's buried say he saved your life then say he fucked up then give him another chance.
        damn, gonna need to try that out in a second playthrough, i only got that thing to 60%
        Is this confirmed? I‘ve read varying things about supporting him throughout the game but not to the point of being a suck up.

Can‘t remember what I said at his grave. But I was stuck at 60% as well.

Actually quite looking forward to NG+ when it‘s out. Maybe together with the actual PS5 version. In that playthrough I could save Takemura as well.
            https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CubJ5M6aQGY&

Follow this. I reloaded a manual save, followed these dialogue options when visiting Johnny's grave, and didn't even complete the band side quests after. My score was at 50% and I was still able to get the secret ending option to trigger. All the enemies are level 50 in that ending, though. And it doesn't really change the ending you get post-choice.
                "Doesn't really change the ending" meaning V still has 6 months to live?
                    Thats, right. V still only has 6 months to live... Only thing that really changes is rogue and the nomads are still alive.
            I did it myself so I'm pretty sure it's correct unless there is another important aspect I just happened to do throughout my playthrough without realising. I was at 60% (and couldn't do the solo ending) went back a few hours re did the grave sequence with everything else the same, got to 70% and could now do the solo ending.
[removed]
    Regardless of which ending you get, the game definitely "just ends". And all of the main characters cease to exist. I probably won't pick it back up until DLC arrives or I finally get a 3080 and just want to see the graphics.
        [removed]
            I was surprised how much the corpo lifestyle was painted as the "wrong" choice. I guess you're technically ex-corpo, but still. Got annoying at the end having Johnny pushing against it so much. I feel like a more fleshed out background system would have the corpo choice take over Arasaka to use the tech for yourself.
                [removed]
Out of twisted curiosity I choose it too, because I wanted to see all endings and I knew it'd end the game right then and there, and the call from Judy was one of the most emotional scenes I've seen in a game.  Really hit me in the feels.
    [deleted]
        That was absolutely devastating. Really well voice acted.
            I just "finished" the game with this ending. I did not know that this would happen, as I thought, this would be a suicide attack with both being half in half in charge.  


It broke my heart. I am not happy with this one bit....  


But then again, while I would choose the Panam ending with Judy by my side, I do not see a reason why I would risk my new found family with such an attack on Arasaka.  


Especially when I played a sneaking, hacking V, I would have liked to get an option to do this on my own terms so to speak.  


I will most likely not go back to play with this character again.   
As all the other options now seems cheesy for me.   
Gonna start a new character I guess and then go with Panam and Judy.

But this incarnation of V .. well, she killed herself.... even if I would no have wanted this to happen and it not making sense in my headcanon on how I played her :/  
Well, can´t win it all everytime, tough luck I guess.
Based on other endings, arasaka falls into ruins after V's intervention, so I don't think soulkiller is the way to go about saving V.
    when you load up v's brain, arasaka is taken over by an engram of the old guy. They guy that started arasaka. He is downloaded into his son's body. And it all works out. He doesn't go to war with Militech.....etc
        He is now immortal which is probably the worst scenario out of any.

If you take the Johnny or Nomad endings, Arasaka basically falls into ruins.
I knew probably 10 hours into my 70 hour playthrough that the game would give me the choice of getting made into a construct.  You could see it a long time coming.  I knew that's what I wanted to do, but when I was sitting there in the space station, I thought about it and decided to return to earth.  Looking back at all the character developments and relations, I didn't think it was fair to leave it all behind and sell my soul to arasaka.  I think I made the right choice in that regard because if you play some of the other endings, you'll notice most of them make mention of Arasaka going down in some form.  IIRC they called the "secure your soul" program a "curse" in one of them.
    >you'll notice most of them make mention of Arasaka going down in some form.  IIRC they called the "secure your soul" program a "curse" in one of them

In the Panem ending there's a terminal in Arasaka tower with some emails that say "Secure Your Soul" actually wasn't working very well yet, there's a list of people it was used on and most were seriously injured/killed by it or their construct didn't come out right.  It also said the real reason for the program was for Arasaka to extract blackmail from the constructs.  Perhaps that all gets revealed to the public in the endings where you attack the tower?
That would have been neat, more choice is always good. That said though I'd still side with Hanako, Yorinobu is starting shit with other corps and corpo wars is bad for normal people.
Not sure what you mean. Helping them get rid of Yorinobu unfucks what he was fucking up. And in the  other endings you really only fuck over Mikoshi, not the entire megacorp.

And the mind uploading is only "dying" in the sense that your body stops working. Your mind is fine. You even probably get a new body later.
What did I invest 20 points into intelligence for if not for a Delamaine-style merger of minds???
EXACTLY. I really thought that would be an option if I did enough of Johnny's quests, but nope.
It could be just memories not Johnny but who knows
So irritating, I refuse to play the game until they fix it in a dlc or som, or I just won’t touch the game whatsoever
Yes, but the game repeatedly breaks the rules for the genre and the tropes.

When you kill off a beloved character early in the game, you need to have other equally loved characters ready to take over. That worked in the first book of GoT, but here it does not work, they relied way too much on the "Oh it's Keanu" factor. And Keanu does not really do anything until the late parts of the game. 

When you have a doomed hero, then he better be able to save the people around him, cause otherwise his sacrifice is empty. Instead V loses Jackie, Evelyn Parker (who had an especially horrible fate), Rogue and probably a few more. Examples, John Hartigan or Marv in Sin City, they knew they were doomed, but made a difference.

Also the game breaks it's own code that it kept stressing: If you rather want to die in a blaze of glory, or have a long life as a nobody. When you side with Arasaka you get the worst ending possible, despite selling out.

Also it's still a game, meant for entertainment. If I wanted a sad "Everything is awful" story, I could read 1984 or similar books...
    [deleted]
        > I mean the point of the story is more about the journey than the end

V even says this multiple times through the game.
        I don't know, I still didn't finish the game but I already feel awful, I knew that it won't be a "happy game" but in my foolishness I hoped that my choice will matter a little more. 

I wonder... maybe it wouldn't hit me that hard if the 2020 was different, but with how it was, I wish that at least I could do some "happy endings" for other characters...
    Disagree the game doesn't break its own code; siding with arasaka is the only way you can live on. But by doing that you're betraying your values, your friends, ur love interests, literally everybody. All the non-arasaka endings have some sense of living a short life in a blaze of glory
        That's the strongest hint to the contract actually saving your life imo. Dialogue and lore can be argued but it makes a lot of sense thematically and narratively. 

I just disagree with the game's implications that you really betray that much.
        Nope. Cause the Arasaka ending does not mean you live on, Takamura tells you himself that the surgery did not save you and that you only have a  few months left. 

Your only choice at this point is to go back to Earth, as a half-lobotomized shadow of yourself and die in a few months.....

Or to upload a copy of yourself to Mikoshi, while your original body will die and you sign yourself and all your rights over to Arasaka. A cruel twist on the promise of "saving" your life. 

The Arasaka endings are the worst possible outcomes. Cause you neither have a blaze of glory, nor did you save your own life. 

The Arasaka ending needs a complete rewrite: they save your worthless ass and "kill" Johnny. You should be rewarded with a corner office in the Arasaka corp, as another faceless stooge bound to them. Now you got your "long life", if you wanna call that a life. It would have fit your betrayal and the desire to save yourself way better and would have been in line with the "Survival at any cost" playstyle.

They also should have allowed us to betray Arasaka in the scene in the tower and let us kill Yorinobu, his sister and Hellman, at the cost of your own life (as an option of "last second remorse"). But I can understand the reason why they did not allow that, because by the time you are in the tower you already made your decision to trust Arasaka. A terrible mistake.
            Arisaka ending isn't the worst. It's one of the only 2 (maybe 3 if you think nomads can actually save you) endings that can potentially save V. They aren't going to keep you prisoner because they will let you leave if you want. Signing the contract is just legal shit in case they never find a way to put you back into a body. This ending can leave you "alive" at an unspecified later date. The other one being working with Mr Blue in the afterlife to do the Crystal Palace Heist because he seems to be offering V something more valuable than money (which V has a ton of at this point) meaning it could be a solution to their problem. This ending has the highest chances of a DLC because you can actually play it out.
    Hard disagree.

The cyberpunk genre is defined by melancholic endings.

Johnny literally says at one point in the panam ending "not in this town, not to people like us" when V asks for a happy ending.

That's cyberpunk.
        Nope, read what the creator had to say in an interview from Dec 2020 (also my character is not a terrorist like Johnny):

“*Cyberpunk* is political, but it’s not political in a  blue-state-red-state-conservative-liberal \[way\],” he says. “It is  basically \[that\] people deserve to be able to get a decent meal, live in  a decent place and do all that if they’re willing to work for it, and  not get screwed over by people more powerful than they are, who may not  need to even screw them over, but are doing it on principle because they  think they can do it.”

Thankfully, in the game at least, that’s where the heroes come in. “Characters in *Cyberpunk*  are heroes, and survive and do well because they are willing to fight  for family or friends, for their neighbourhoods,” Pondsmith tells us.

    >  If you rather want to die in a blaze of glory, or have a long life as a nobody.

EXACTLY THIS. I was so hyped to blow up the new Arasaka tower like Johnny did in the past, or something major that impacts the world, but it feels like your death is completely meaningless! What happened to getting ourselves remebered in The Afterlife?
It felt like the game had so much build up but just fizzled out.
    Some people even think in 1984 Orwell implies in the glossary of terms that Oceania eventually collapsed, based on his past-tense verbiage in the section on Newspeak and the fact that he fought very hard to include that glossary in the book even when it would have been more lucrative for him to remove it.
    I couldn’t fucking agree more, it’s a game so just give an option for the happy ending then everybody happy. 

Jesus it’s like TLOU2 all over again, these stupid writer/ developer centered stories need to change, make it a truly open ending game, rather than pretending to be one. 

In my opinion the story of this game is heavily underdeveloped, like every time I enter a new area a stranger would call me then suddenly we are buddies doing jobs, no introduction, no context what so ever. It almost feel like they hired different writers to write stories for each character then magically taped them together through robotic phone introductions
Thing is that the game was heavily promoted as allowing you to make your own decisions. Instead the player repeatedly loses control at decisive junctions in the game and is forced on a railroad experience with no way out.

Dystopia is one thing, but taking away control by the way of cutscenes or outright forbidding certain actions, is a very lame story telling vehicle.
    > taking away control

That's sort of the point of the cyberpunk genre. No one has any control over their lives. Taking control away from V and by extension us is a major theme within the genre. Even though V gets to choose who to go with his fate has already been sealed. Everything was out of his control.
        That would be ok in a book, but not in a first person open world game. If everything was out of anyone's control then people like Saburo Arasaka or Morgan Blackhand would not exist.
    “ Thing is that the game was heavily promoted as allowing you to make your own decisions. Instead the player repeatedly loses control at decisive junctions”


Getting to make decisions doesn’t mean you win. Just like in real life. Sometimes you do all the right things and still fail.
    There will never be a game like the one you are describing. Never. It's not even about technology like it was back in the day when people expected cutscene level graphics in game. There just simply isn't enough time to make a game like this where every single choice has an impact. The amount of man hours in writing alone would be insane. There are games that come close but none of them have a blank canvas MC to play as. They all have a character that has clear goals and intentions that you kind of tweak a little or go along with as you play.
    Wait so let me get this straight.

You want to be told a story, but you also want to write the story yourself with unlimited potential paths?

Might want to check your logic choom
        Unlimited paths? I would be happy if one of the 7 endings was not doom and gloom.

What's the crystal palace?  Am I dumb or is this something from the Cy2020 tabletop game or something?
    It's an in-game private space station for the unimaginably uber-rich. In the Path of Glory ending V undertakes a job to infiltrate and steal from the Crystal Palace in exchange for an unexplained "promise" from a new character who is implied to be very powerful.
    It's a luxury resort of sorts on a space station.
Right, finally a cool legendary trench coat. Too good to be true I guess
    I am curious if it is glitched, I assumed they would be the items you get rewarded, but I didn't seem to get shit after "resetting back".
        That's what I assume
        Same, I think they mean special weapons you can pick up in certain endings. I got rogues pistol and it carried over.
    I got one off placid
>Anyone with the Panam ending figure out how to get the three legendary items in the chest next to the basilisk? Takes you to the credits and you don't get to keep them... A coat pants and boots

this is actually a good theory if it happens ill come back to this
Maybe nomad contacts have located some rare tech or genius up there that can help.  Bam aldecados going to space.  Hell what if an ending there means they get to be space nomads.  Hopping planet to planet.
Dude I was playing on an all night bender when the devil tarot appears... Scared the ever loving shit out of me.
So the only people who get to enjoy their time with V are Judy and Panam?

I hate when the game designs a preferential LI
    No.

If you romance River, and then take the Panam route for ending, River joins you and the nomads out in the open road (90% sure this is the case). 

So you gotta finish the Panam story (obv not romancing her), so the Nomads helping you is a thing for ending.
        I heard that this happens with Judy but not River—which checks out with the fact that he’s prioritizing his family now

I’d love if that was the reality tho
            That's a shame, but i can also see why he doesn't join.

To me it seems like Female V with Judy going with Nomads is the best ending for all chars involved (well not all chars, but ones you do quest with)

River has his sister and nephews to take care off
Panam has her family now, Judy on the other hand lost pretty much everything and wants to leave Night City anyway.
                My ideal ending wouldn’t involve leaving Night City, tbf. I’d want to stay right there and spend the time with him and his family, over chasing a pipe dream in the middle of fucking nowhere.
You can, but that's more of a "Hey, I'm here too!" sort of thing. By hooking up with Panam, you get an entire extra ending option. By hooking up with Judy, you get a "bye-bye now!" call to her and then you get forced to side with Arasaka or do the Johnny ending. Total missed opportunity IMO.
    Actually u can take a romanced Judy with you, in the panam ending, just make sure u do both.
    I was really looking forward to doing the Panam route UNTIL I find out that Kerry legit breaks up with Male V if you go that route. The relationship legit was the shortest out of ALL the relationships in the game.  I feel like the Nomad ending or/and the Heist ending should be considered canon since both give you a sense of hope that you may find a cure.  I forced myself to do the Rogue (heist) ending due to that being the only ending you actually get to be with your love interest (if you go for Kerry or River).  It also adds a bit of mystery to who the mysterious man with blue eyes is and what he has planned if V was to succeed in his Heist.  We will see early next year if we are lucky!
Lol I feel like im stuck there right now. I don't know what I'd do without the internet. I'm blown away by the fact being stuck in "cyber limbo" is supposed to be the bad ending. It feels like so much of science fiction is fear of what's next and new. I was really hoping for something like Ghost in the Shell's or Neuromancer's forward thinking strangeness, that Alt's solution should have been a bridge to the new, instead of just highlighting what's human. I thought Cyberpunk was about what's beyond human.
    What's more transhumanism than cheating death? I don't see why people are viewing Mikoshi as something bad.
        Copies are copies. You are dead but you created a virtual copy of yourself that thinks it is alive. A real shame to the poor child
            This. A copy may have all the original properties but it’s still not the original. So even if he was copied to an engram and it didn’t still end with V dying after a few months, he was dead the minute he was killed by the soul killer and *copied*.
                That's the thing though we still haven't define what consciousness really is, if it is simply the neurons firing in our brains then, a 1 to 1 copy of that is by definition your consciousness, if an engram simply scans the brain and converts it into an AI then it complicates the problem even more because we don't even know what a conscious AI look like let alone how it works.
                    Even if you would consider engram a conscious it would still be a duplicate.
                        that the whole point of my argument, since we do not know the nature of consciousness we cant say that a copy isn't you. you cannot make claims about dying if we don't know what happens to your consciousness after you die. if a teleporter deconstructs your body in the atomic level what says that the reconstructed version is still you, we do not know the nature of consciousness in our universe, until it is defined then you cannot claim otherwise. if engram V remembers how he or she became an engram then what makes her a duplicate?
                            In my view it’s not about if the engram is the actual person or not. It’s all about instances for example you can create an instance of a new process on a computer ok now let’s go further and spawn the exact same process again it’s not the same instance. Now if we were to kill the original instance you would be left with a copy that is not the original instance but exactly the same in every regard. My point is the original instance is dead regardless of the perfect copy still running. I hope I clarified my point.
        Having played Cyberpunk, the framing.

Unless you mean conceptually, if you ask people if the human lifespan should be increased, they'll likely say no, having accepted that death is a part of "life" despite technology also being part of it.
        They call it soul killer because it's doing exactly what it's named after.

You can't just transfer what makes you "you" into the digital realm. That's not how consciousness works.

The engram would be you for all intents and purposes, and act like you would, change like you would, but when you go in you die. The copy of you is "born", and has a discrete life from that point on.

That's why some would prescribe those machines as evil. If employed en masse, they would commit genocides to create an army of engrams, all corporate property of Arasaka. "don't worry, the law will catch up and recognize engrams as people" was very disconcerting.

        You don't get stuck in Mikoshi, that's not what Hellman says. Arasaka has a service for extremely rich clients who want to be immortal via body-hoping, it's called Secure Your Soul. That's what the contract is. You'll be in Mikoshi until they find a compatible body to give you. Then you'll live again. 

On the other hand joining Alt beyond the Blackwall does mean you'll be there "forever". Which is technically not really dying, since your mind will keep existing there, but you're also gone from the physical world for all intents and purposes.
            [deleted]
                Getting a new body because yours can't be saved is why they're offering the contract in the first place though. And I'm pretty sure the offer is free, you didn't pay for removing the biochip or the weeks of treatment either, and they don't mention a price with the contract either. 

You make an agreement that they stop you from dying in exchange for helping them retake control from the traitor son. You did your part and it seems like they're doing theirs. They let you leave no questions asked if you don't sign, makes no sense to only betray you if you sign and be cool with you if you don't.
                    [deleted]
                        I agree it's left vague af, just seems to me like the whole point of that ending is that you live in exchange for giving up the fight and all. Like in the opposite ending where you attack them, you're fighting the megacorp and become a legend, but you die. It's more narratively and thematically fitting if the ending where you surrender yourself to them actually saves your life, but at the cost of everything else. Ideals vs life.

        > a more fleshe

But if you join the "Save your Soul Program", don't you technically live on forever? With the slim possibility of being brought back in the future.
            [deleted]
                also don't forget... what if Arasaka never solves the body rejection issue?  Or if you get new leadership at Arasaka that believes you are too much of a loose end to revive?  Going into Mikoshi is one of the darkest potential endings imo.
I completed judy and panams questlines. but i chose for the rogue ending, when Judy called V an asshole it hurt. Gonna try again with that panam one
In the line of work of a merc that dichotomy isn’t false but rather wishful because between the other outcomes 99% of the time are much worse. How many times have you reloaded before getting to street cred lvl 50? On every gig you can die and get dumped in a junkyard and forgotten.
    I mean, if I stay alive through the Arasaka deal, then I'm not going out, and I'm not exactly living quiet, cause I'm a famous merc. The theme is totes bullshit.

I didn't reload that much, but it's an RPG, saving before doing anything risky or taking important choices is how most people I know plays that kind of game.
    To be fair, once I found a shotgun with 4 mod slots it was all easy from there on.  If I really tried hard not to die to dumb shit like falling off buildings or walking on land mines I'm sure I'd manage a no deaths / no saves run.  You can get something ridiculous with the double barrel shotguns or the carnage by putting 4 crafted crunch mods on it.  Shotguns are unique in that regard because they shoot multiple pellets, all of which receive the damage bonus.  Kind of broken tbh, made the smasher fight incredibly easy.  Start one shotting everything.
I think this would have a lot more substance if not for the fact that there is an ending where V soloes the entire Arisaka tower and destabilizes the corporation such that they can openly come to power as the new king/queen/legend of Night City.
    Lol true
I think people are rightfully annoyed that they could see this coming from 100 miles away (most notably Jackie himself on the same trajectory dying tragically) and there's nothing they can do to avert this despite it being an interactive medium. Compounding this is the fact that V is not a pre-established character but is supposed to be a vessel for the player, yet the player gets railroaded into this one "Legend" motivation for V that they may not share.
Yea bc I gave up on everyone else to gamble on the corpo ending so its really lonely bc there's only a few people you can call and hanako doesn't answer. I guess it's supposed to be a punishment for betraying everyone in a sense but I would love to see a dlc where V wakes up in a new body like in Altered Carbon, but in this, she gets the girl.
What do you think would've happened if this was a 60 hour campaign? Do you think that could've been a turning point where V becomes adam smasher pt 2 and follows a new quest line for arasaka? On a side note, my one disappointment with the corpo life path is that you still feel like an outsider to corpos. With Meredith it isn't noticeable but when talking to maiko I think we're way out of our league and that doesn't really make much sense to me. Also I kind of wish V was japanese in that one so that she fit in with arasakas, but I realize that's a lot to wish for
Same feelings here. If V (or Johnny) has to go out it should be with a bang that makes an impact (I was promised a burning city or at least Arasaka). Overall the endings lacked that extra oomph, the beginning and the middle of the game were much much stronger. The main story wrapped up too quickly. 

In terms of going out with a bang the space casino ending is the closest but even then without Johnny being present it feels very bittersweet (and it's just a cut scene ...for now?). You spend the entire game chasing the cure and then in the end Alt says 'no sorry actually just realized I can't help ya'. And her solution feels like an even worse Mikoshi. Another place where the loser is gonna be trapped forever but this time impossible to come back from. 

To me the relationship with Johnny was the absolute heart of the story. It really seemed like you have two main characters in the game and you get to develop them both as their fates become more and more intertwined. I'm actually surprised a lot of people seem to dislike him. I loved how rough and no bullshit (and hilarious) their interactions were. Really matched the harshness of the world. And how it could turn into a genuine friendship where both sides really developed. So I'm crushed you don't get to preserve that friendship, especially if you focus on it instead of the romantic options. 

Having to choose between one character or the other really doesn't make me want to go back because now you have this cloud hanging over you since you know what's coming.
Mass Effect 2 was such a perfect “ensemble” game, where the amount of effort you put into caring about your team mates actually decided the ending you got, and it was super rewarding. Same goes for your decisions as Geralt in TW3 and how your parental influence on Ciri and choices with Yennefer and Triss really impacted the endings and ultimate fates of those characters as well. This is sorely lacking in CP2077, sadly. The questlines for characters like Rogue, Judy, and Panam are overall very short, and it just doesn’t feel like the relationships are earned? Similarly, the endings just feel punishing and yeah, they make the rest of the story feel futile and unsatisfying.

Sad endings can be effective when well done. John Marston’s end in RDR1 felt tragic, but fitting, for example. But this... it’s just rushed and it feels like they didn’t have enough time to wrap up the story nicely after so many re-works to put all the focus on Johnny so they’d have more Keanu, and so the endings, like the lifepaths and so many other things, feel tacked-on and badly designed.
And I don’t think anything will change after we do the ending. For me, it’s no point to finish it.
[deleted]
    Definitely, that's my biggest issue with that ending entirely. I mean hell, most of them already know about the condition to begin with, how hard is it to give them some closure.
Yea it's true, after I chose to sign the contract honestly ngl my first impressions is wow that is underwhelming but afterwards it does make you think which is pretty rare in games, most of the time after finishing a game you pretty much get over it instantly but this game makes you think even after finishing it.
    ppl are pissed, because it left a really bitter taste afterwards even if it makes you think. Noone wants to invest 50 hours into a game to get fucked in the end
        Well it's a dystopia it's no different than watching my favourite tv show and at the end of 30 episode my favourite character gets killed off. It is supposed to be depressing, hell if they added an ending that is by our standard "happy" kinda breaks the immersion of the whole fucked up world the cyberpunk universe is. A good story is one that makes the reader think the meaning behind it themselves and not spoonfed in a silver platter. 

Not saying you are wrong, I was pissed when I found out v dies in every single situation that is why I say the arasaka ending is the best one it gives V a second chance.
            I like the idea of it, but from the presentation it feels pretty clear the writers intended for it to be a bad ending.

It could have been a more cyberpunk ending if a transcendence ending happened more like the Ghost in the Shell movie. Like instead of just Johnny or just V, there's a synthesis. There was a lot of foreshadowing for synthesis but it just never happened.

IMO a real good, bad ending, could have been V becoming the next Adam Smasher, a full chrome corpo hitman. A complete subversion of what Johnny was fighting against. You become the oppressor.
                The game has a theme of ideals being bigger than just living, and the Arasaka contract is presented like giving up your ideals to live. Even though you can roleplay through dialogue that this isn't what V wants. Jackie talked about wanting to be a Legend, with a drink named after him. I never did. I don't care. 

Even becoming an Arasaka enforcer in exchange for living wouldn't necessarily be that bad. Takemura was an alright dude. Smasher is an asshole but he was always like that, being a cyborg or a corpo didn't change him.
I'm more of a the outcome sucks with a silver lining kinda guy. A series called shin megami tensei does this pretty well. The mainline games all have depressing ending but there are silver linings to them. The ending isn't completely bad, but it isn't completely good either. Not just completely bad.

In Shin megami tensei 4, the player only has one "good" ending and eventually the same things that happened in the game will happen again because it simply delayed the inevitable and humanity rebuilds itself only for the same thing to happen again at a time far later in history.

In the bad endings, you have law. Where you essentially cleanse all with free will and create a kingdom ruled by angels. Everyone is very happy, however they have no free will and are incapable of sinning. However because you were exposed to those with free will you were cleansed as well. And the cycle ends.

In the chaos ending you let demons wreak havoc on humanity. And it creates a world where everyone is free to do as they please. There is no fear of a tyrant ruling over them or ever taking power, because if that happens someone can come and dethrone them because might equals right in this world. And the cycle ends.

In the nihilism ending, you activate a perpetual reactor that releases all life in the universe from gods design. And there is no war, pain, hunger, or anything negative. This is because there is nothing at all left in the universe. The reactor created a black hole that erases everything from the universe. Ending the cycle once more. However in the manga, it's explained the protagonist grew to regret their actions and created realities in which he didn't exist to see what would happen.

All of these endings are pretty fucked, but they each have a silver lining and they tend to be pretty honest as long as you understand picking sides in SMT Is taking the selected ideology to the extreme because there's no other choice and it's the factions best chance at winning.

Give me a Cyberpunk ending and I'll give you a version that'd give you the SMT feeling. In SMT the endings give you a sense of satisfaction but with the knowledge of knowing you did some fucked up shit to get there and even then it's not a panacea to all your problems.
Personally I'm not mad that the endings aren't happy, I'm annoyed that the one I picked (which I don't even consider bad anyway) just ends abruptly and doesn't give me details. It's left vague to seem deep probably but I'm just annoyed and disappointed.
Sure there's that, but you 100% die if you don't sign. So the choice is either don't lose the connections you have, have them for 6 months, then die. Or lose them now, maybe get them back later, and if not, get new ones eventually.
As I understood it he basically went on a suicide mission to go out on his own terms, just like Rogue, hence the grin.
Well ok but that would mean we have to start from scratch? Would be rather annoying.
    Not necessarily.  You could start at V's level that you ended in game.  There is lots of ways you could do it if you're CD Projekt Red.
Thank you for actually giving sources. The game could have had a satisfying ending and still be in the Cyberpunk genre. They just wanted to be cliche with dark shit and lazily end the game quickly.
That's a pretty bad false dichotomy though. Lots of people die quietly and there's no good reason you couldn't live in a blaze of glory.
    Considering blaze of glory means you die swinging, how would one live in a blaze of glory? That doesn't make sense.
        I mean like, if your life is being the top edgerunner it might not be as spectacular as soloing a private army and blowing a top secret basé but it's not exactly a quiet life either.
Well it looks like if you aren't compatible the process changes your DNA and you will die.
I think the arasaka soul was the probably the best outcome for him to live on. I doubt they tried to bullshit ya cause takemura (you can save him from the apartment) Really seems convincing and promises he will find another body and that when he gets another one takemura promises to take him around Japan.
> Plus the Panam ending just feels more polished and more thought through

Which is weird considering triggering it is kinda random in a way as a StreetKid. Johnny and Rogue are part of your path more frequently and more organically than Panam, who you only meet once and never again (unless you go out of your way to do her side quests)... 

However, Panam offers a more satisfying ending. Before tonight I was set at going the Rogue/Johnny way, but now that I know about how open and optimistic Panam’s ending are, I’ll just change route and call the Nomads. Still feel weird and unnatural, but at least I will get something somewhat satisfying out of it.
    > (unless you go out of your way to do her side quests)...

If you don't - you should not get the option of this ending, that would make no sense.
        I mean, I get that, but my point is that in order to get a somewhat hopeful ending you have to abandon the main organic narrative and do *her* sidequest, despite the fact you barely hear/see her again after her branch in the main story.
            All the "character-arc" sidequests are like that. For Judy, River, Panam.. hell, even the one for Johnny. Or the one for Jackie's funeral.  It is a question of friendship - if you consider that character someone worthwhile, a friend - you take time to do them. For me it was pretty organic, especially considering Panam as romance option.
            That’s one way to view it. But you could also say that Johnny and Rogue represent the trap of Night City, they’re legends in their own right and you can become one too... but look at the cost they paid. And Jackie paid. And every street kid pays pursuing that goal. 

Choosing the Nomads IS a bit random, because it’s you breaking that cycle. Potentially for the better.
    Very late to the party, but to me I thought the most thematically appropriate ending was Johnny leading a new raid of Arisaka tower, only this time he's not doing it to destroy or to fulfill some ill-defined grab for glory, but to save V (and for my headcanon nomad V, it was also appropriate that possibly their final act would be to put their complete faith in another to save their life). And I thought that mission was awesome! Looking forward to replaying the game with Male V so I can romance Panam and get my "happy" ending, if we want to call it that.
        I understand what you're saying but i disagree with your assetment of the game's theme. This wasnt Johnny's story, it was V's. Leaving the soul sucking corporate Night City for the road with Panam feels more like canon.
            Depends on how you view the story - Is it a redemption arc in which V learns it's not about where you end up, but the people you love (Nomad ending)? Or is it a rags to riches story where V finally, and at a great cost, becomes the greatest merc in all of night city?
                Yeah, it depends. The rags to riches is pushed heavily. The whole reason was to become the king of Night City. 

After it sucks you up and spits you out though, I like the redemption/nomad arc.
                    
Interesting - I tried both endings as of yesterday and I strongly feel the rags to riches ending felt better. I barely wanted to finish the nomad ending for my street kid V who wanted to be a legend. I think it purely depends on what WE want for our Vs!
            We are in agreement, I was referring specifically to the quest itself.
    You can totally make it work for a streetkid I think, it's what I did and I just saw it as my V was sick of the city and the pain it's brought and was enjoying living the nomad life on his jobs with Panam so decided fuck it, nomad life let's go
        Makes sense cuz in the beginning the street kid went to Atlanta hoping it was better than NC. After being burned by the city life, it’d make sense to go nomad.
    wanna give my opinion on your post to just make you feel a bit more comfortable with choosing panam... If we take references from films and series, 

altered carbon takeshi started somewhat "corpo" being in the army and ended up with a group of rebels.

oblivion, jack harper started from "corpo" but ended up rebel.

Luke skywalker, scrapper/tinkerer.

Elisium almost has that same ending feel where they gang up to take down the big shots.

some more but I dont wanna think anymore and you get  the idea. Nomads are the nearest we can get to rebels in the game (with the exception of silverhand and his chooms. that was 50 years ago)

    I don't think Kerry gets ghosted? If you are in a relationship with Kerry and choose the nomad ending, Kerry shows up to the camp in a taxi shortly before you leave and breaks up with you. Now that was a gut punch for me. All those people you got killed by asking the nomads for help, and your boyfriend doesn't even leave with you.
        Kerry has a real life and a career outside of you. River has his family. It makes sense that neither of them drop their whole everything to come on your escape, just like it makes sense for Judy to quit Night City and leave with you.

I don't see how it's a stab at the Aldecaldos that neither Kerry or River come with you; they're not the nomad's family. You are.
            Never said it was a stab at the Aldecaldos, I said it was a gut punch to me, because I'd grown to like Kerry and his relationship with V during my playthrough, I was sad that I had to leave him behind.
            Which is why the female V with Judy in the Panam ending is the best to me - it gets the most good people out of NC and happy.
        I'm so pissed about this ending. It doesn't feel like the good ending everyone said it was. Your boyfriend leaves you and you get a bunch of good people killed, all so you can live 6 months more. Honestly wtf? I was somehow happy with the game despite the bugs but this has left a bad taste in my mouth I can't shake. I even felt a strong emotional/ friendship connection to Panam, but still. Ugh.

Edit: extra words
Could as easily explore the arasaka ending though. The one where you can sign a contract. Maybe they find a way to give v a new body. Seeing as this is one of the default endings it's way more likely to be explored in the future.
    There would be no Johnny Silverhand then, which would be a bummer. The main character, V, was not really that Iconic or memorable. Johnny Silverhand compensated for that. Without Silverhand, I think the game would lose its cool factor. That's why I initially thought Arasaka ending would not be explored. Also, whether you choose Mikoshi or Earth is important. They cant possibly explore both, it's vastly different. Nomad ending only has one option and that is to leave Night City. If you give the body to Johnny, he also leaves Night City, which, in my mind, indicates that they want to explore other cities or states maybe due to the creative freedom it will provide. Night City is well-defined but other cities or states are less so.
What about blue eyes man? That ending has too many unknowns and sometimes frightens me. I doubt V is alone to kill all the corpo owners and rich people.
Lmao tell me about it, have so much fun just roaming around, running off a laptop with a 2080 maxq atm so can't wait for my pc parts to play it at a decent frame rate, what are you rocking hardware wise?
    Love to see that people are actually enjoying the story and this game. This sub feels so toxic to be on. Feels like there is no place to be enthausiastic about this game. This game really gripped me for it's storytelling and people you meet, but so many people wanted so much different things from this game. Everyone had their idea of cyberpunk in their head before the game launched, but there is only one version of it. Without bugs and some fixing of AI perhaps this game should be ready for a lot of good story DLC. Hope to see the pan am ending expanded as she is one of the characters and stories I ended up caring for the most. Best written of the characters and side quests IMO. Was really happy to find out there was a somewhat happy ending for her.

            Hey, I noticed you're account is kind of new, just so you know, you don't need to put a sub's URL to link to it, just r/ and the subs name works, in your case r/lowsodiumcyberpunk
Totally agree with you, she's always there to comfort and support you. Great character.
Totally misty reminds me of Mayuri from steins gate tbh
Yeah I felt a similar way going with the rogue one, I didn't go with Panam because I felt like I didn't want to risk her life, or the nomads. I might do that my next PT because I'm mad that I also left Takemura behind, and I didn't know you could go back for him. The guy was one of my favorite characters too. 

I also don't mind sad endings, I mean I loved RDR2's, its a gem. But what i got felt like there was no resolution, and in fact my character's life worsened in quality with River.
    Little late but 100% agreed. I legit didn't know you could go back for Takemura. An optional objective didn't show up so I thought he was gone. Only found out a little bit later after looking up some of the missions online. Really made me sad since, like you said, he was one of my favorites too. If there's at least one thing CDPR did right, it's the fuckin characters. I honestly think I can say I like pretty much every single one of them.
        the characters were nice. I think River needed more to his questlines, but hes still likeable. I didn't think I'd like everyone as much as I did, so I agree. The story line itself is good too. Only wished for some finer details in some areas, but hopefully if they do a dlc it will expand on the characters we got attached to.
            Yeah River was my first romance of the bunch, figured I'd do separate playthroughs with the others later. He's honestly pretty cool, and I'd argue his side job quest line was both quite disturbing and also very well done. Probably one of my favorites. Panam's questline was definitely quite fun too, and the first time I got to test run the Basilisk, I got pretty hype lol. Sadly, I didn't finish up all of Judy's before I beat the game, but I'll probably just go back before the endgame sequence and wait out a day to finish. She seems pretty cool too.

That's definitely something I hope they do as well: flesh out the romance options/characters more. Gonna be a while before we get DLC though, I imagine. I'm okay with that.
                I thought there'd be a little more to River's questlines, they were well done. I agree, but by doing two things with him he calls about missing V, which i don't think is fully justified since they barely know eachother, where as Panam and Judy do have longer sequences before the romance scenes. I do like the dynamic between the cop angle and a law breaking merc. I wish they played with that a little more. 

It would be cool to have new romances as well, given i guess some can break it off with you depending on what ending you go with. It'll be interesting how they tie everything together.
        I did the Panam ending and on the end credit scene, Takemura San told me to go to hell. I saved him and all. Anyone got this too?
Do sad endings make you not like the story?
    Garbage endings make me not like the story. 🤷‍♂️  Especially in games where post story dlc could be easily doable.  Fallout 3 was probably the only game that fixed their ending with dlc.
        Sad endings aren't necessarily garbage though. The first ending I tried was the suicide one and... it's probably the worst but it was quite powerful and well made. Its message might seem quite obvious but it's one that is always good to remember: suicide is not difficult for the one committing it... it's hard for the ones left behind and that have to keep on living (which is paradoxical because V choses this end because it's the "least bloody"... except he/she didn't factor in the pain and despair).
I played through all the endings too, i noticed that when Misty was reading the cards to you, the only good one was with Panam and every other ending besides Panam's was a bad card reading. I think Panam's ending is canon, just feels like they've done more work into her ending then another. I really hope that Panam's ending is canon.
    I feel the same. It definitely should be the canon ending considering the others were just hollow in comparison.
        Yeah all the other endings just felt depressing, but Panam's ending actually felt good, it gave me hope about V's survival. But yeah again i really hope this ending is canon
    Panam's ending is the only one that has V taking full control of herself and her destiny. In the other endings, she hands over control to someone else, be it Johnny or Arasaka. In that way, the game's theme is for self-actualisation, as V is only rewarded for bringing herself out of the mess she's in.
        not necessarily. [you missed an ending.](https://youtu.be/UIi-Ufnvkg0?t=144) :)

spoilers, obviously. >!this ending is insanely difficult. i came in with my overpowered build at level 44 doing 10,000+ damage per bullet with a smart SMG and had to crank the difficulty down to easy to pull it off. the enemies are bullet sponges who will 1-2 shot you depending on build and if you die during it, counts as the suicide ending and rolls credits, meaning you have to give up or redo the whole ending sequence up to that point. balls hard challenge run.!<
    She gives you a good reading on the Path of Glory ending too, at least if you do the solo mission. I still liked Panam's ending better though.
    I think all the endings suck in some way still. If you go with Panam then Johnny ends up merging with Alt.
You don't need to romance her for the ending.  As female V my lovely Judy left with us.
    Ah, that's great, thanks for clearing that up.
    Really cool. As male V romancing Panam and  being friend with Judy, she sends a message and it's obvious she's on the road (outdoors, maybe by a camp fire) and says that leaving NC is the best choice.
Can only romance Panam if your a male. The ending for Panam just feels more thought of or something like they put more time into the ending. Hope it's canon man
That's a Johnny Silverhand line.
    Oh 😂😂😂 I was like "well that escalated quickly."
        I felt the confusion in your comment xD
            I was like that went from 0-100 so fast I got whiplash 😂
                Yeah johnny is edgy.
find the secret ending ;)
    Isn't secret ending the "blaze of glory" one
        definitely not coming back as V from that ending.


just did this ending last night and felt like an asshole lol
            Ya both Jude and panam leaves u, while the male ones actually stay in the ending (vice versa if it's the panam ending)
                spoilers

&#x200B;

Jude and panam left me, I did the finish with arkasia - but seems they were done with me way before then, even after finishing their stories
                    Ya no one likes the arisaka ending
                for me, i had no relationships and never finished panam/judy storyline.


they both left messages in the credits asking me to call them sometime but acted like i was too busy/famous for them now.


dunno if the credit messages change depending on relations.
                    [deleted]
                        > because they all said something like "Ah, voice mail again

I got the ending with Panam and only Rogue said that in the credits
                    Well you are among the top dogs in blaze of glory ending, plus might be super busy bcoz of the casino lmao.
        isnt dont fear the reaper the secret one?
            Ya I think so, bcoz u literally walk in the front door and nobody dies
Yeah I felt the story build really well because you have a constant motivation to be cured.... But as soon as you get "cured" it's game over and you have to go back to dying again. Spending all your time while you're dying doing odd jobs for random people feels out of character for V to be doing lol
Ff15 did the same thing and it was the worst. Though I accept the Panam ending and thought it was great, I really wish they didnt have to leave. Maybe that ending will be the true ending and we'll get some return to NC dlc, lol.
RDR2 as well. Seriously enough with this shit.
Completely get what you're saying but this is where the medium is at odds with its neo-noir setting. From a player satisfaction perspective, you'd always want to give players the choice of continuing to experience the world after the story is over. But the game exists primarily to tell this story, and that sense of dread and urgency are a huge part of the atmosphere.

In other words: wait for mods, or invest in a PC and then wait for mods.
That would be cool. But for some games like Horizon, it would be basically two different maps before and after the story. So the devs would have to work twice to make it good. Probably would’ve made the game launch way later or more probably would split the team on the both maps and then they would be only half as good.
In Witcher 3, the bad ending wasn't considered "canon" so they just based it off of the other ones and left it a little vague.

I'm actually wondering if they have a dlc planned that is all about picking up with months left to live and finding a cure, because it seems so odd that they would force V to be in that same circumstance no matter what happens. All you can really influence is V's attitude and methods, but V's circumstance is very similar in all of the ones where they live.

That spacewalk shit was stupid though.
    I think it’d be cool if they somehow worked the ending people chose into it, for sure. Like I know it’s unrealistic, but I chose >!to let Johnny take V’s body for a reason.!< To be told that my intentional ending doesn’t actually exist would suck. I imagine if someone got Ciri killed in the Witcher it was an accident (although anything is possible.) I picked >!Johnny over V because my V cared about him, would take a bullet for him, and realized that he could have a whole life while she would only get another 6 months.!< 

If they could tweak the storyline you mentioned so that Johnny >!in V’s body!< is trying to find a way to >!get ahold of new bodies and save V from behind the black wall or whatever!< it would be ideal for me. 

Of course that doesn’t solve the issue of the >!suicide!< ending but that one seems hard to come back from.
I get what you mean but a Johnny DLC would be cool.
    It definitely would and it would work well since it would take place pre-game. 

I’m just wondering if and how the dlc’s can expand on the main story of the game since the endings would make it difficult.
        Yeah, unless they make a different path for each ending in a dlc, it would be a lot of effort for an expansion. Or they make one ending canon but then that would make every other ending kinda pointless. Although I would love to see a continuation of the main story but I think if anything they’ll do a new story with a different main character.
            Making one ending canon makes sense imo. The Panam ending is the "good" ending, and the only one with any real hope. Almost all other endings leads to the death of V.

Same situation if you give Johnny your body. It's no longer V in there, it's not "us". 

So yeah, the nomads ending seems to be the only ending with the possibility to branch out.
                Well it might be possible that V survives the space casino heist
                    space casino V gave up on a cure. They live only to become the legend that will last.

Id say that Nomad ending and Arasaka ending (version where you go back to earth) are only ones that actually puts a way to find any cure.
                        But blue eyes is like, if u succeed, then he could provide a cure???
                Sorry, to chime in on an old thread but man... Those endings do not leave much hope for any sort of decent DLC continuing the story.

Making one ending "canon" completely removes player agency from the endings. I don't think the endings were very strong either.
                    Yup, the endings were weak AF.  Especially if you chose to identify with Johnny.  They strip the player of all agency in the Rogue mission option, which is garbage. They give you all the agency to try and patch things up with Rogue with conversation points and decisions that lead you to a point in the mission where her and Johnny agree to start fresh together then bam! It ignores all the effort you put in up to that point and does not make use of any decision points from prior.  Hell, Mass Effect 2 and Witcher 3 allowed all these things and its strange how CDPR chose to take this weird route where they give you all this agency only to strip it away right at the end.
            Yeah it’s a tough situation because dropping people’s endings could cause even more drama, but one canon ending or a new story in the same world would make the most sense.

Either way I’m hoping for a continuation of my ending that results in a happy ending for both V and Johnny. Unrealistic, sure, but it’s my hope lol.
                My hope is that they go back to fix the endings for Johnny so that Rogue doesnt get fragged or at least put in some method where your conversation decisions/skills allow you to interrupt Smasher's sequence.  Huge missed opportunity there and really sours the game for me so much so that it makes replaying it in the current state unpalatable.
You can easily do it just by telling players that the DLC is accessible if you achieved X,Y, or Z ending, and not on the other options.  It's not like anyone would be locked out, because the game saves automatically before talking to Hanako and takes you back to there if you choose to keepin playing.

So you could easily have the DLC be accessible for any of the "6 months to live" endings.
\[spoilers for Mass Effect and Fallout\]  


 imagine it'll be like Mass Effect 3, where it was possible to have a canon ending to your mission back in Mass Effect 2, but if you play 3 it's assumed you're branching from a different point  


Or like in Fallout 3, where if you get the DLC you survive your sacrifice
While I don't disagree that Night City is a dystopia, the game is full of moments and characters that constantly reinforce the idea that there are bonds and ideals that the corporations cannot crush. Nothing about Jackie or his family is dystopian, Johnny's bond with Rogue persists after 50 years, Panam and the Aldocaldos are repeatedly depicted as a tight bond outside the corporate structure, V can choose to be merciful in several major moments, Viktor and Misty are objectively good people, and so on. There are many good endings to stories in Night City (or at least, positive endings to certain chapters), so to say to the player that no matter what they do they're fucked takes away from a large part of what the game has said over the last (in my case) 50 hours.
    Yup, they give you agency to be a good person with reinforcing mechanisms around you from Jackie/Misty to Johnny/Rogue to V/love interest.  After 90 hours of playtime where they build you up with hope to then suddenly tear it away at every option was just not good.  I identified with Johnny through my play through and even got the bond with V pretty high so towards the point of no return i went through the heart wrenching goodbyes to Panam and then played as Johnny.  Throughout the entire mission it gives you hope that, even after 50 years, shes still in love with you as you are with her.  Right at the point where your character and her decide to start fresh everything gets smashed.  At that point, none of your choices matter and every end point is just a depressing mess.  Reading about the other endings makes it all the more depressing.

This is starting to feel like those "subverting expectations" style writing courses they try to do and the story just slaps you down hard no matter what.  Makes replayability very low as there is virtually no good outcome. Like honestly, how is Mass Effect 2 still the gold standard on this stuff after so long???  The game gave you agency to bond with characters and affect their end game while so many games continue to do this all or nothing stuff.  

I should have been able to save Rogue during the final assault instead of watching her die and in the end being Johnny where everyone i know or knew is dead is just not a good way to run a story for which you want a person to assume the identity for.
    It's the thing that I got from it. Yeah the corps' greed are squeezing whatever they can from the environment and don't care if they grind everyone into dust in the process, but they haven't. With all their power and might and tech people are still people. As utterly terrifying as Night City is there is still beauty in it, people still find beauty in it that doesn't revolve around the kill or be kill mentality.

The fact that every ending is damn near kicking your feet out from under you and laughing at you for thinking that has really left a sour taste in my mouth. Got 3 of the 5 ending sequences and uninstalled. Might come back to it in a year when as much of the stuff is fixed as possible but for now think I'm done.
there's a happy end for literally all of the people you choose to spend time with.

so....CDR is doing a have your cake and eat it too moment. Like Viktor Vektor? Heck, just be nice to him. He's happy and your friend. Like Panam? Fuck it, go shoot shit up with her. Like Judy? Be there for her. Any1 u like you can get a happy ending for. Except yourself. Oh and except Jackie. And that's supposed to teach you some deep lesson about the dark world of CyBeRpUnK. 

The thing isn't even internally consistent.
> arguably a branch where you'd be just allowed to live; a "happy end"

Not dying is not a happy ending. A happy ending would be you make so much money that you can retire rich and young, kinda like GTAV.

I was hoping V could live to fight another day. You can tell whoever wrote the endings in no way shape or form played the game except maybe a couple hours.
No matter what, I experienced a hard to forget story and moved by it a lot, connected with the very well made side characters and amazed by the story of the game, even if it messed with my feelings like you said.

I'm happy with endings actually, it wouldn't feel organic and realistic this much if V wouldn't have been dying no matter what. I'm on the same page with you.

Edit: As for the sequel, I hope they create a new character, maybe tying it with V in the event chain of history somehow. I really hope they don't pull an unrealistic and hard to believe trick to bring V back. Things that can't be done by Arasaka or Alt, also shouldn't be available to Mr. Blue Eyes.
How is it dystopic when the game offers to give the body to johnny, who gets to live? In every scenario V is the only one who gets absolutely fucked, even Johnny can live if the player chooses to.
    Johnny taking over your body and leaving the city is essentially the most positive ending, V doesn’t suffer anymore and Johnny is essentially redeemed of his douchey old ways and he moves on...
They can still do this ending... While letting you continue to play the game after  it's done... I mean it just seems like they had to shove this thing out the door.
It’s a game, it meant to be make people happy and plus it’s not like we are asking let that be the ONLY ending, you still have many choices. 

They just tucked up the story like what TLOU2 did
Yeah i don’t understand where a lot of these people are coming from either. Not all stories have happy endings, and V is in a pretty damn rough spot to begin with. There are hints throughout the game that things in Night City rarely end well, and V’s story goes along perfectly for that
technically he's going to die, no reason in a DLC they couldn't find some miracle ripperdoc who can fix V or some other bullshit cure from a Corp.
    I highly doubt that DLC's will extend/explain the endings. It's most likely gonna be something like Johnny DLC or V/Jackie old days DLC.
        I don't think they'd do that tbh. I feel like any DLC might even be a separate character at this point. Pretty stupid way to end the game IMO. The problem with multiple choice endings is a DLC continuing them would most likely invalidate some of the endings... Which is I've always hated in RPGs. 

It removes player choice.
            Use your imagination Choom,  think about how the game ended it branches out in the end with the Major choices, but more or less the same outcome. 

DLC could start branched out as well.

Here how I would like to see it:
1. you load up the Brand new DLC
2. A prompt pops up and asks you what Ending you chose.
3.You choose and the game starts a a Short Prologue basically on whatever you chose but will braid your "Past" into more Linear Story DLC.

You know, like the Lifepath thing at the start, nomad, Streetkid , Corpo.. you started differently but ended up meeting Jackie, took Dexs Job, etc.etc. 

That's how this could work, but.. not every ending, like Jonny taking over wouldn't work for my Theory or possibly the Arasaka ending (? Havent played that one yet ,so please no spoilers)

In which case I would see that they would pull the same thing they did on the Blood and Wine DLC where only the "good" endings will be Cannon.

Also because I doubt they will get Keanu Reeves to Voice Jonny for a whole freaking DLC "Branch" probably expensive  as hell.
                Before you meet Hanako you get a call, to save your life and continue living, by doing so you get none of the shit ass gonk endings, canon af bruh. I will direct it 100% choom, its gonna be preem.
                >Use your imagination Choom,  think about how the game ended it branches out in the end with the Major choices, but more or less the same outcome.

So it either means that the developers have to pick an ending to be canon. Which is fucking stupid in an open ended game. Might as well not allowed for multiple endings at all in that case. Removes all player agency from the main story. Which was my point.

or

It means they have to craft some sort of DLC that incorporates all of the endings... Including the ones where Johnny takes over V's body and leaves the city. Which seems nigh impossible especially for CDprojectRed to handle correctly.

&#x200B;

I don't think they "can't" do it. I just think the endings are varied enough that they may go with Option 1. Which is super lame.
                    Well I would guess that some endings would be disabled , as I said I doubt they would get Keanu into this game again expect for maybe a couple of one liners.

So I would assume that some endings are considered .. bad endings which wouldn't progress into a Story DLC.. just like the suicide one.

But the main endings , Night City Afterlife Boss and the Nomad one could very definitely be continued which like I said would simply branch out at the beginning only to twirl into a linear story just like the beginning of the game , and if you think about it, there are only 3 endings which would make sense to continue on Nomad, Afterlife Boss, and Return from the Arasaka Space station..
You dont know that. Its pretty clearly, and intentionally, open ended. Probably so they have something to use for sequels/dlc.
    I mean Alt that fucking AI told us so and that shit is probably the smartest thing around in the Cyberpunk universe and if you pick the Arasaka ending the smartest brains in Arasaka reached the same conclusion so I don't really see how V can be saved if the best possible candidates for saving her life were both pretty  set on her dying in 6 months.

But there is to hoping I guess.
        That kinda ruined the game for me. I reached the point of no return tonight and upon reading about it I ended being spoiled by the whole ending. No hard feelings though, but during my playthrough I was hard focused on the main quest as I wanted to save V and save her life ASAP since this was obviously an urgency, I would then focus on the other content afterward.

Turns out that not only its a lost cause, but I'm thrown back pre point of no return after the end anyway. Which condemn me to forever be stuck with an AI slowly killing V in all my future playthrough/free roam sessions.

It sucks.
            Yup I feel you hard, exactly how I played my V and I want to feel like all my work to cure V meant something. I wanna be in night city not as someone slowly dying so I don't feel weird doing all this side content that just feels out of place for V to be doing
                This reminds me we’ll forever be plagged by the random OLD RELIC MALFUNCTION condition until the end of time since we never truly get rid of that.

Best design decision ever lol
            >Turns out that not only its a lost cause, but I'm thrown back pre point of no return after the end anyway. Which condemn me to forever be stuck with an AI slowly killing V in all my future playthrough/free roam sessions.  
>  
>It sucks.

100% this. I played a game a similar way until I got to the point of no return. Then I did all the side content but like... Most of it felt super frivolous. Let me go scuba diving while this AI is frying my mind... It doesn't make sense narratively.

I was hoping, like you, for an ending that would allow me to re-enter the world and do all the side shit after finishing the main story. But it's all tied to Johnny, which was a mistake, so I understand why they did it the way the did... CDPR has a problem with story writing this way. Witcher 3 had similar problems.
        Alt isn't the smartest thing though, she said it herself. She can't use soulkiller to its fullest capabilities after all the Arasaka changes.


Also, best candidates yet. Remember there are private networks like the voodoo boys that netwatch is trying to control. Plus, a whole unexplored world.
        Super late to the party but I would note that Alt is very deliberately *not* depicted as omniscient or flawless (She has to wipe out the Voodoo boys to save herself from Netwatch if you trust the Netwatch agent, she says she's been trying and failing to breach Mikoshi for 50 years, she obviously screws up V's diagnosis (assuming Alt wasn't lying, which we have no reason to think she was)). 

In the Arisaka ending Hellman analogizes what has happened to V as similar to the damage inflicted by radiation poisoning, but tbh that line was reasonably comforting to me: It's the year 2077 and you're telling me no one anywhere has figured out radiation poisoning, not even to mitigate it?? 

Beyond that, the reason people like the Panam ending is that it is the only ending that is geared towards leaving the player with hop: Hope for a cure, but also (and separately) hope for an escape from the dystopia they have been living in for the last 20-60 hours. I would have lived to see more ambiguity, or just flat out more hope, from the other ostensibly legitimate and good endings.
            How tf can adam smasher live looking like he does but V cant lol, there has to be a way.
                Adam's basically a complete cyber body, which is sort of why the Arisaka endings don't bother me. 

Assuming that at some point they will get the risks of a fully cyber body down to a tolerable level, then getting engram'd and then stuffed in a cyberframe later on is fine.
                    One of the side missions suggests editing engrams is possible. Wouldn’t want to emerge as diet V in a new body with all negative tendencies eliminated (as defined by Arasaka).
    You die no matter what. As soon as you enter mikoshi alt uses soulkiller on you and creates an engram, a copy of you. Is a copy of you really you? What makes you you?
Damn thats kind of disappointing. I wonder what they might do for expansions then.
    Could be another protagonists story. I like to think that V was our introduction into the CP77 universe; or it could be early / mid-game expansions + possibly new endings who knows.
        Another protag will make all of cyberpunk feel so wasted though.. like u make ur own char, ur own choices and relationships and now u gotta make a new protag? Nah, i hope not
            What's wrong with telling multiple stories in Night city? V became a Legend, would be interesting to hear about them and maybe run into old friends time to time while you make new ones

I really liked how Gta4 did this with it's DLC, same world different stories
                Well for gta4 we still got a definitive ending for Niko, there are way too many loose ends for cyberpunk.

2. Im ok playing with another character for a sequel. The story for V seems unfinished and the devs possibly made it so open-ended for reason.
        i'm betting that they will just be addtional quests in the world, so you need to load a save before the final mission anyway.
            I feel like the story was created to make the multiplayer have respawning in the lore. I feel like the DLC will also incorporate the immortality factor after Arisaka discovers the chip works.
                Not like the cloning vats haven't been a thing in other major cyberpunk fiction. Cyberpunk is a perfect precursor to worlds like altered carbon.
Not necessarily, he has about 6 months to live but nothing says he can't find a cure in that time. The end credits could imply that he's dead and therefore can't answer. But on the all along the watchtower mission you can talk with cassidy and his dialogue gives me major vibes that V doesn't die, as long as you don't think he will and think that you will survive. That it's all about outlook.  
Realistically it doesn't look great for V but you never know.
    Yup got the same vibe. Got the same feeling at the end of MGS when Snake gets Fox Die and Naomi says there is no way to know when he will die and he just has to live (and he does, for quite a while). Plus there are several Kojima references in the game.
One of the endings hints that Delamain might be able to help V. 

&#x200B;

I think the "cure" will still come in the form of some AI related bullshit. 

&#x200B;

I'll say I'm disappointed in the endgame in general. The endgame felt rushed much like the latter 1/3 of the Witcher 3 felt empty.
Yea that was my thought at first too.
Step 1 of grief:Denial
You need 70% you only live once. And then when you have to chose how to raid the tower you select the johnny and rouge one and sit there for a few minutes. From what I can tell to get 70% all you have to do is do all the johnny side quests and when your at where he's buried say he saved your life then say he fucked up then give him another chance.
    damn, gonna need to try that out in a second playthrough, i only got that thing to 60%
    Is this confirmed? I‘ve read varying things about supporting him throughout the game but not to the point of being a suck up.

Can‘t remember what I said at his grave. But I was stuck at 60% as well.

Actually quite looking forward to NG+ when it‘s out. Maybe together with the actual PS5 version. In that playthrough I could save Takemura as well.
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CubJ5M6aQGY&

Follow this. I reloaded a manual save, followed these dialogue options when visiting Johnny's grave, and didn't even complete the band side quests after. My score was at 50% and I was still able to get the secret ending option to trigger. All the enemies are level 50 in that ending, though. And it doesn't really change the ending you get post-choice.
            "Doesn't really change the ending" meaning V still has 6 months to live?
                Thats, right. V still only has 6 months to live... Only thing that really changes is rogue and the nomads are still alive.
        I did it myself so I'm pretty sure it's correct unless there is another important aspect I just happened to do throughout my playthrough without realising. I was at 60% (and couldn't do the solo ending) went back a few hours re did the grave sequence with everything else the same, got to 70% and could now do the solo ending.
Regardless of which ending you get, the game definitely "just ends". And all of the main characters cease to exist. I probably won't pick it back up until DLC arrives or I finally get a 3080 and just want to see the graphics.
    [removed]
        I was surprised how much the corpo lifestyle was painted as the "wrong" choice. I guess you're technically ex-corpo, but still. Got annoying at the end having Johnny pushing against it so much. I feel like a more fleshed out background system would have the corpo choice take over Arasaka to use the tech for yourself.
            [removed]

    That was absolutely devastating. Really well voice acted.
        I just "finished" the game with this ending. I did not know that this would happen, as I thought, this would be a suicide attack with both being half in half in charge.  


It broke my heart. I am not happy with this one bit....  


But then again, while I would choose the Panam ending with Judy by my side, I do not see a reason why I would risk my new found family with such an attack on Arasaka.  


Especially when I played a sneaking, hacking V, I would have liked to get an option to do this on my own terms so to speak.  


I will most likely not go back to play with this character again.   
As all the other options now seems cheesy for me.   
Gonna start a new character I guess and then go with Panam and Judy.

But this incarnation of V .. well, she killed herself.... even if I would no have wanted this to happen and it not making sense in my headcanon on how I played her :/  
Well, can´t win it all everytime, tough luck I guess.
when you load up v's brain, arasaka is taken over by an engram of the old guy. They guy that started arasaka. He is downloaded into his son's body. And it all works out. He doesn't go to war with Militech.....etc
    He is now immortal which is probably the worst scenario out of any.

If you take the Johnny or Nomad endings, Arasaka basically falls into ruins.
>you'll notice most of them make mention of Arasaka going down in some form.  IIRC they called the "secure your soul" program a "curse" in one of them

In the Panem ending there's a terminal in Arasaka tower with some emails that say "Secure Your Soul" actually wasn't working very well yet, there's a list of people it was used on and most were seriously injured/killed by it or their construct didn't come out right.  It also said the real reason for the program was for Arasaka to extract blackmail from the constructs.  Perhaps that all gets revealed to the public in the endings where you attack the tower?
[deleted]
    > I mean the point of the story is more about the journey than the end

V even says this multiple times through the game.
    I don't know, I still didn't finish the game but I already feel awful, I knew that it won't be a "happy game" but in my foolishness I hoped that my choice will matter a little more. 

I wonder... maybe it wouldn't hit me that hard if the 2020 was different, but with how it was, I wish that at least I could do some "happy endings" for other characters...
Disagree the game doesn't break its own code; siding with arasaka is the only way you can live on. But by doing that you're betraying your values, your friends, ur love interests, literally everybody. All the non-arasaka endings have some sense of living a short life in a blaze of glory
    That's the strongest hint to the contract actually saving your life imo. Dialogue and lore can be argued but it makes a lot of sense thematically and narratively. 

I just disagree with the game's implications that you really betray that much.
    Nope. Cause the Arasaka ending does not mean you live on, Takamura tells you himself that the surgery did not save you and that you only have a  few months left. 

Your only choice at this point is to go back to Earth, as a half-lobotomized shadow of yourself and die in a few months.....

Or to upload a copy of yourself to Mikoshi, while your original body will die and you sign yourself and all your rights over to Arasaka. A cruel twist on the promise of "saving" your life. 

The Arasaka endings are the worst possible outcomes. Cause you neither have a blaze of glory, nor did you save your own life. 

The Arasaka ending needs a complete rewrite: they save your worthless ass and "kill" Johnny. You should be rewarded with a corner office in the Arasaka corp, as another faceless stooge bound to them. Now you got your "long life", if you wanna call that a life. It would have fit your betrayal and the desire to save yourself way better and would have been in line with the "Survival at any cost" playstyle.

They also should have allowed us to betray Arasaka in the scene in the tower and let us kill Yorinobu, his sister and Hellman, at the cost of your own life (as an option of "last second remorse"). But I can understand the reason why they did not allow that, because by the time you are in the tower you already made your decision to trust Arasaka. A terrible mistake.
        Arisaka ending isn't the worst. It's one of the only 2 (maybe 3 if you think nomads can actually save you) endings that can potentially save V. They aren't going to keep you prisoner because they will let you leave if you want. Signing the contract is just legal shit in case they never find a way to put you back into a body. This ending can leave you "alive" at an unspecified later date. The other one being working with Mr Blue in the afterlife to do the Crystal Palace Heist because he seems to be offering V something more valuable than money (which V has a ton of at this point) meaning it could be a solution to their problem. This ending has the highest chances of a DLC because you can actually play it out.
Hard disagree.

The cyberpunk genre is defined by melancholic endings.

Johnny literally says at one point in the panam ending "not in this town, not to people like us" when V asks for a happy ending.

That's cyberpunk.
    Nope, read what the creator had to say in an interview from Dec 2020 (also my character is not a terrorist like Johnny):

“*Cyberpunk* is political, but it’s not political in a  blue-state-red-state-conservative-liberal \[way\],” he says. “It is  basically \[that\] people deserve to be able to get a decent meal, live in  a decent place and do all that if they’re willing to work for it, and  not get screwed over by people more powerful than they are, who may not  need to even screw them over, but are doing it on principle because they  think they can do it.”

Thankfully, in the game at least, that’s where the heroes come in. “Characters in *Cyberpunk*  are heroes, and survive and do well because they are willing to fight  for family or friends, for their neighbourhoods,” Pondsmith tells us.

>  If you rather want to die in a blaze of glory, or have a long life as a nobody.

EXACTLY THIS. I was so hyped to blow up the new Arasaka tower like Johnny did in the past, or something major that impacts the world, but it feels like your death is completely meaningless! What happened to getting ourselves remebered in The Afterlife?
It felt like the game had so much build up but just fizzled out.
Some people even think in 1984 Orwell implies in the glossary of terms that Oceania eventually collapsed, based on his past-tense verbiage in the section on Newspeak and the fact that he fought very hard to include that glossary in the book even when it would have been more lucrative for him to remove it.
I couldn’t fucking agree more, it’s a game so just give an option for the happy ending then everybody happy. 

Jesus it’s like TLOU2 all over again, these stupid writer/ developer centered stories need to change, make it a truly open ending game, rather than pretending to be one. 

In my opinion the story of this game is heavily underdeveloped, like every time I enter a new area a stranger would call me then suddenly we are buddies doing jobs, no introduction, no context what so ever. It almost feel like they hired different writers to write stories for each character then magically taped them together through robotic phone introductions
> taking away control

That's sort of the point of the cyberpunk genre. No one has any control over their lives. Taking control away from V and by extension us is a major theme within the genre. Even though V gets to choose who to go with his fate has already been sealed. Everything was out of his control.
    That would be ok in a book, but not in a first person open world game. If everything was out of anyone's control then people like Saburo Arasaka or Morgan Blackhand would not exist.
“ Thing is that the game was heavily promoted as allowing you to make your own decisions. Instead the player repeatedly loses control at decisive junctions”


Getting to make decisions doesn’t mean you win. Just like in real life. Sometimes you do all the right things and still fail.
There will never be a game like the one you are describing. Never. It's not even about technology like it was back in the day when people expected cutscene level graphics in game. There just simply isn't enough time to make a game like this where every single choice has an impact. The amount of man hours in writing alone would be insane. There are games that come close but none of them have a blank canvas MC to play as. They all have a character that has clear goals and intentions that you kind of tweak a little or go along with as you play.
Wait so let me get this straight.

You want to be told a story, but you also want to write the story yourself with unlimited potential paths?

Might want to check your logic choom
    Unlimited paths? I would be happy if one of the 7 endings was not doom and gloom.

Learn to read choom
It's an in-game private space station for the unimaginably uber-rich. In the Path of Glory ending V undertakes a job to infiltrate and steal from the Crystal Palace in exchange for an unexplained "promise" from a new character who is implied to be very powerful.
It's a luxury resort of sorts on a space station.
I am curious if it is glitched, I assumed they would be the items you get rewarded, but I didn't seem to get shit after "resetting back".
    That's what I assume
    Same, I think they mean special weapons you can pick up in certain endings. I got rogues pistol and it carried over.
I got one off placid
No.

If you romance River, and then take the Panam route for ending, River joins you and the nomads out in the open road (90% sure this is the case). 

So you gotta finish the Panam story (obv not romancing her), so the Nomads helping you is a thing for ending.
    I heard that this happens with Judy but not River—which checks out with the fact that he’s prioritizing his family now

I’d love if that was the reality tho
        That's a shame, but i can also see why he doesn't join.

To me it seems like Female V with Judy going with Nomads is the best ending for all chars involved (well not all chars, but ones you do quest with)

River has his sister and nephews to take care off
Panam has her family now, Judy on the other hand lost pretty much everything and wants to leave Night City anyway.
            My ideal ending wouldn’t involve leaving Night City, tbf. I’d want to stay right there and spend the time with him and his family, over chasing a pipe dream in the middle of fucking nowhere.
Actually u can take a romanced Judy with you, in the panam ending, just make sure u do both.
I was really looking forward to doing the Panam route UNTIL I find out that Kerry legit breaks up with Male V if you go that route. The relationship legit was the shortest out of ALL the relationships in the game.  I feel like the Nomad ending or/and the Heist ending should be considered canon since both give you a sense of hope that you may find a cure.  I forced myself to do the Rogue (heist) ending due to that being the only ending you actually get to be with your love interest (if you go for Kerry or River).  It also adds a bit of mystery to who the mysterious man with blue eyes is and what he has planned if V was to succeed in his Heist.  We will see early next year if we are lucky!
What's more transhumanism than cheating death? I don't see why people are viewing Mikoshi as something bad.
    Copies are copies. You are dead but you created a virtual copy of yourself that thinks it is alive. A real shame to the poor child
        This. A copy may have all the original properties but it’s still not the original. So even if he was copied to an engram and it didn’t still end with V dying after a few months, he was dead the minute he was killed by the soul killer and *copied*.
            That's the thing though we still haven't define what consciousness really is, if it is simply the neurons firing in our brains then, a 1 to 1 copy of that is by definition your consciousness, if an engram simply scans the brain and converts it into an AI then it complicates the problem even more because we don't even know what a conscious AI look like let alone how it works.
                Even if you would consider engram a conscious it would still be a duplicate.
                    that the whole point of my argument, since we do not know the nature of consciousness we cant say that a copy isn't you. you cannot make claims about dying if we don't know what happens to your consciousness after you die. if a teleporter deconstructs your body in the atomic level what says that the reconstructed version is still you, we do not know the nature of consciousness in our universe, until it is defined then you cannot claim otherwise. if engram V remembers how he or she became an engram then what makes her a duplicate?
                        In my view it’s not about if the engram is the actual person or not. It’s all about instances for example you can create an instance of a new process on a computer ok now let’s go further and spawn the exact same process again it’s not the same instance. Now if we were to kill the original instance you would be left with a copy that is not the original instance but exactly the same in every regard. My point is the original instance is dead regardless of the perfect copy still running. I hope I clarified my point.
    Having played Cyberpunk, the framing.

Unless you mean conceptually, if you ask people if the human lifespan should be increased, they'll likely say no, having accepted that death is a part of "life" despite technology also being part of it.
    They call it soul killer because it's doing exactly what it's named after.

You can't just transfer what makes you "you" into the digital realm. That's not how consciousness works.

The engram would be you for all intents and purposes, and act like you would, change like you would, but when you go in you die. The copy of you is "born", and has a discrete life from that point on.

That's why some would prescribe those machines as evil. If employed en masse, they would commit genocides to create an army of engrams, all corporate property of Arasaka. "don't worry, the law will catch up and recognize engrams as people" was very disconcerting.

    You don't get stuck in Mikoshi, that's not what Hellman says. Arasaka has a service for extremely rich clients who want to be immortal via body-hoping, it's called Secure Your Soul. That's what the contract is. You'll be in Mikoshi until they find a compatible body to give you. Then you'll live again. 

On the other hand joining Alt beyond the Blackwall does mean you'll be there "forever". Which is technically not really dying, since your mind will keep existing there, but you're also gone from the physical world for all intents and purposes.
        [deleted]
            Getting a new body because yours can't be saved is why they're offering the contract in the first place though. And I'm pretty sure the offer is free, you didn't pay for removing the biochip or the weeks of treatment either, and they don't mention a price with the contract either. 

You make an agreement that they stop you from dying in exchange for helping them retake control from the traitor son. You did your part and it seems like they're doing theirs. They let you leave no questions asked if you don't sign, makes no sense to only betray you if you sign and be cool with you if you don't.
                [deleted]
                    I agree it's left vague af, just seems to me like the whole point of that ending is that you live in exchange for giving up the fight and all. Like in the opposite ending where you attack them, you're fighting the megacorp and become a legend, but you die. It's more narratively and thematically fitting if the ending where you surrender yourself to them actually saves your life, but at the cost of everything else. Ideals vs life.
                        [deleted]

    > a more fleshe

But if you join the "Save your Soul Program", don't you technically live on forever? With the slim possibility of being brought back in the future.
        [deleted]
            also don't forget... what if Arasaka never solves the body rejection issue?  Or if you get new leadership at Arasaka that believes you are too much of a loose end to revive?  Going into Mikoshi is one of the darkest potential endings imo.
I mean, if I stay alive through the Arasaka deal, then I'm not going out, and I'm not exactly living quiet, cause I'm a famous merc. The theme is totes bullshit.

I didn't reload that much, but it's an RPG, saving before doing anything risky or taking important choices is how most people I know plays that kind of game.
To be fair, once I found a shotgun with 4 mod slots it was all easy from there on.  If I really tried hard not to die to dumb shit like falling off buildings or walking on land mines I'm sure I'd manage a no deaths / no saves run.  You can get something ridiculous with the double barrel shotguns or the carnage by putting 4 crafted crunch mods on it.  Shotguns are unique in that regard because they shoot multiple pellets, all of which receive the damage bonus.  Kind of broken tbh, made the smasher fight incredibly easy.  Start one shotting everything.
Lol true
Definitely, that's my biggest issue with that ending entirely. I mean hell, most of them already know about the condition to begin with, how hard is it to give them some closure.
ppl are pissed, because it left a really bitter taste afterwards even if it makes you think. Noone wants to invest 50 hours into a game to get fucked in the end
    Well it's a dystopia it's no different than watching my favourite tv show and at the end of 30 episode my favourite character gets killed off. It is supposed to be depressing, hell if they added an ending that is by our standard "happy" kinda breaks the immersion of the whole fucked up world the cyberpunk universe is. A good story is one that makes the reader think the meaning behind it themselves and not spoonfed in a silver platter. 

Not saying you are wrong, I was pissed when I found out v dies in every single situation that is why I say the arasaka ending is the best one it gives V a second chance.
        I like the idea of it, but from the presentation it feels pretty clear the writers intended for it to be a bad ending.

It could have been a more cyberpunk ending if a transcendence ending happened more like the Ghost in the Shell movie. Like instead of just Johnny or just V, there's a synthesis. There was a lot of foreshadowing for synthesis but it just never happened.

IMO a real good, bad ending, could have been V becoming the next Adam Smasher, a full chrome corpo hitman. A complete subversion of what Johnny was fighting against. You become the oppressor.
            The game has a theme of ideals being bigger than just living, and the Arasaka contract is presented like giving up your ideals to live. Even though you can roleplay through dialogue that this isn't what V wants. Jackie talked about wanting to be a Legend, with a drink named after him. I never did. I don't care. 

Even becoming an Arasaka enforcer in exchange for living wouldn't necessarily be that bad. Takemura was an alright dude. Smasher is an asshole but he was always like that, being a cyborg or a corpo didn't change him.
Not necessarily.  You could start at V's level that you ended in game.  There is lots of ways you could do it if you're CD Projekt Red.
Considering blaze of glory means you die swinging, how would one live in a blaze of glory? That doesn't make sense.
    I mean like, if your life is being the top edgerunner it might not be as spectacular as soloing a private army and blowing a top secret basé but it's not exactly a quiet life either.
> (unless you go out of your way to do her side quests)...

If you don't - you should not get the option of this ending, that would make no sense.
    I mean, I get that, but my point is that in order to get a somewhat hopeful ending you have to abandon the main organic narrative and do *her* sidequest, despite the fact you barely hear/see her again after her branch in the main story.
        All the "character-arc" sidequests are like that. For Judy, River, Panam.. hell, even the one for Johnny. Or the one for Jackie's funeral.  It is a question of friendship - if you consider that character someone worthwhile, a friend - you take time to do them. For me it was pretty organic, especially considering Panam as romance option.
        That’s one way to view it. But you could also say that Johnny and Rogue represent the trap of Night City, they’re legends in their own right and you can become one too... but look at the cost they paid. And Jackie paid. And every street kid pays pursuing that goal. 

Choosing the Nomads IS a bit random, because it’s you breaking that cycle. Potentially for the better.
Very late to the party, but to me I thought the most thematically appropriate ending was Johnny leading a new raid of Arisaka tower, only this time he's not doing it to destroy or to fulfill some ill-defined grab for glory, but to save V (and for my headcanon nomad V, it was also appropriate that possibly their final act would be to put their complete faith in another to save their life). And I thought that mission was awesome! Looking forward to replaying the game with Male V so I can romance Panam and get my "happy" ending, if we want to call it that.
    I understand what you're saying but i disagree with your assetment of the game's theme. This wasnt Johnny's story, it was V's. Leaving the soul sucking corporate Night City for the road with Panam feels more like canon.
        Depends on how you view the story - Is it a redemption arc in which V learns it's not about where you end up, but the people you love (Nomad ending)? Or is it a rags to riches story where V finally, and at a great cost, becomes the greatest merc in all of night city?
            Yeah, it depends. The rags to riches is pushed heavily. The whole reason was to become the king of Night City. 

After it sucks you up and spits you out though, I like the redemption/nomad arc.
                
Interesting - I tried both endings as of yesterday and I strongly feel the rags to riches ending felt better. I barely wanted to finish the nomad ending for my street kid V who wanted to be a legend. I think it purely depends on what WE want for our Vs!
        We are in agreement, I was referring specifically to the quest itself.
You can totally make it work for a streetkid I think, it's what I did and I just saw it as my V was sick of the city and the pain it's brought and was enjoying living the nomad life on his jobs with Panam so decided fuck it, nomad life let's go
    Makes sense cuz in the beginning the street kid went to Atlanta hoping it was better than NC. After being burned by the city life, it’d make sense to go nomad.
wanna give my opinion on your post to just make you feel a bit more comfortable with choosing panam... If we take references from films and series, 

altered carbon takeshi started somewhat "corpo" being in the army and ended up with a group of rebels.

oblivion, jack harper started from "corpo" but ended up rebel.

Luke skywalker, scrapper/tinkerer.

Elisium almost has that same ending feel where they gang up to take down the big shots.

some more but I dont wanna think anymore and you get  the idea. Nomads are the nearest we can get to rebels in the game (with the exception of silverhand and his chooms. that was 50 years ago)
I don't think Kerry gets ghosted? If you are in a relationship with Kerry and choose the nomad ending, Kerry shows up to the camp in a taxi shortly before you leave and breaks up with you. Now that was a gut punch for me. All those people you got killed by asking the nomads for help, and your boyfriend doesn't even leave with you.
    Kerry has a real life and a career outside of you. River has his family. It makes sense that neither of them drop their whole everything to come on your escape, just like it makes sense for Judy to quit Night City and leave with you.

I don't see how it's a stab at the Aldecaldos that neither Kerry or River come with you; they're not the nomad's family. You are.
        Never said it was a stab at the Aldecaldos, I said it was a gut punch to me, because I'd grown to like Kerry and his relationship with V during my playthrough, I was sad that I had to leave him behind.
        Which is why the female V with Judy in the Panam ending is the best to me - it gets the most good people out of NC and happy.
    I'm so pissed about this ending. It doesn't feel like the good ending everyone said it was. Your boyfriend leaves you and you get a bunch of good people killed, all so you can live 6 months more. Honestly wtf? I was somehow happy with the game despite the bugs but this has left a bad taste in my mouth I can't shake. I even felt a strong emotional/ friendship connection to Panam, but still. Ugh.

Edit: extra words
There would be no Johnny Silverhand then, which would be a bummer. The main character, V, was not really that Iconic or memorable. Johnny Silverhand compensated for that. Without Silverhand, I think the game would lose its cool factor. That's why I initially thought Arasaka ending would not be explored. Also, whether you choose Mikoshi or Earth is important. They cant possibly explore both, it's vastly different. Nomad ending only has one option and that is to leave Night City. If you give the body to Johnny, he also leaves Night City, which, in my mind, indicates that they want to explore other cities or states maybe due to the creative freedom it will provide. Night City is well-defined but other cities or states are less so.
Love to see that people are actually enjoying the story and this game. This sub feels so toxic to be on. Feels like there is no place to be enthausiastic about this game. This game really gripped me for it's storytelling and people you meet, but so many people wanted so much different things from this game. Everyone had their idea of cyberpunk in their head before the game launched, but there is only one version of it. Without bugs and some fixing of AI perhaps this game should be ready for a lot of good story DLC. Hope to see the pan am ending expanded as she is one of the characters and stories I ended up caring for the most. Best written of the characters and side quests IMO. Was really happy to find out there was a somewhat happy ending for her.

        Hey, I noticed you're account is kind of new, just so you know, you don't need to put a sub's URL to link to it, just r/ and the subs name works, in your case r/lowsodiumcyberpunk
Little late but 100% agreed. I legit didn't know you could go back for Takemura. An optional objective didn't show up so I thought he was gone. Only found out a little bit later after looking up some of the missions online. Really made me sad since, like you said, he was one of my favorites too. If there's at least one thing CDPR did right, it's the fuckin characters. I honestly think I can say I like pretty much every single one of them.
    the characters were nice. I think River needed more to his questlines, but hes still likeable. I didn't think I'd like everyone as much as I did, so I agree. The story line itself is good too. Only wished for some finer details in some areas, but hopefully if they do a dlc it will expand on the characters we got attached to.
        Yeah River was my first romance of the bunch, figured I'd do separate playthroughs with the others later. He's honestly pretty cool, and I'd argue his side job quest line was both quite disturbing and also very well done. Probably one of my favorites. Panam's questline was definitely quite fun too, and the first time I got to test run the Basilisk, I got pretty hype lol. Sadly, I didn't finish up all of Judy's before I beat the game, but I'll probably just go back before the endgame sequence and wait out a day to finish. She seems pretty cool too.

That's definitely something I hope they do as well: flesh out the romance options/characters more. Gonna be a while before we get DLC though, I imagine. I'm okay with that.
            I thought there'd be a little more to River's questlines, they were well done. I agree, but by doing two things with him he calls about missing V, which i don't think is fully justified since they barely know eachother, where as Panam and Judy do have longer sequences before the romance scenes. I do like the dynamic between the cop angle and a law breaking merc. I wish they played with that a little more. 

It would be cool to have new romances as well, given i guess some can break it off with you depending on what ending you go with. It'll be interesting how they tie everything together.
    I did the Panam ending and on the end credit scene, Takemura San told me to go to hell. I saved him and all. Anyone got this too?
Garbage endings make me not like the story. 🤷‍♂️  Especially in games where post story dlc could be easily doable.  Fallout 3 was probably the only game that fixed their ending with dlc.
    Sad endings aren't necessarily garbage though. The first ending I tried was the suicide one and... it's probably the worst but it was quite powerful and well made. Its message might seem quite obvious but it's one that is always good to remember: suicide is not difficult for the one committing it... it's hard for the ones left behind and that have to keep on living (which is paradoxical because V choses this end because it's the "least bloody"... except he/she didn't factor in the pain and despair).
I feel the same. It definitely should be the canon ending considering the others were just hollow in comparison.
    Yeah all the other endings just felt depressing, but Panam's ending actually felt good, it gave me hope about V's survival. But yeah again i really hope this ending is canon
Panam's ending is the only one that has V taking full control of herself and her destiny. In the other endings, she hands over control to someone else, be it Johnny or Arasaka. In that way, the game's theme is for self-actualisation, as V is only rewarded for bringing herself out of the mess she's in.
    not necessarily. [you missed an ending.](https://youtu.be/UIi-Ufnvkg0?t=144) :)

spoilers, obviously. >!this ending is insanely difficult. i came in with my overpowered build at level 44 doing 10,000+ damage per bullet with a smart SMG and had to crank the difficulty down to easy to pull it off. the enemies are bullet sponges who will 1-2 shot you depending on build and if you die during it, counts as the suicide ending and rolls credits, meaning you have to give up or redo the whole ending sequence up to that point. balls hard challenge run.!<
She gives you a good reading on the Path of Glory ending too, at least if you do the solo mission. I still liked Panam's ending better though.
I think all the endings suck in some way still. If you go with Panam then Johnny ends up merging with Alt.
Ah, that's great, thanks for clearing that up.
Really cool. As male V romancing Panam and  being friend with Judy, she sends a message and it's obvious she's on the road (outdoors, maybe by a camp fire) and says that leaving NC is the best choice.
Oh 😂😂😂 I was like "well that escalated quickly."
    I felt the confusion in your comment xD
        I was like that went from 0-100 so fast I got whiplash 😂
            Yeah johnny is edgy.
Isn't secret ending the "blaze of glory" one
    definitely not coming back as V from that ending.


just did this ending last night and felt like an asshole lol
        Ya both Jude and panam leaves u, while the male ones actually stay in the ending (vice versa if it's the panam ending)
            spoilers

&#x200B;

Jude and panam left me, I did the finish with arkasia - but seems they were done with me way before then, even after finishing their stories
                Ya no one likes the arisaka ending
            for me, i had no relationships and never finished panam/judy storyline.


they both left messages in the credits asking me to call them sometime but acted like i was too busy/famous for them now.


dunno if the credit messages change depending on relations.
                [deleted]
                    > because they all said something like "Ah, voice mail again

I got the ending with Panam and only Rogue said that in the credits
                Well you are among the top dogs in blaze of glory ending, plus might be super busy bcoz of the casino lmao.
    isnt dont fear the reaper the secret one?
        Ya I think so, bcoz u literally walk in the front door and nobody dies
I think it’d be cool if they somehow worked the ending people chose into it, for sure. Like I know it’s unrealistic, but I chose >!to let Johnny take V’s body for a reason.!< To be told that my intentional ending doesn’t actually exist would suck. I imagine if someone got Ciri killed in the Witcher it was an accident (although anything is possible.) I picked >!Johnny over V because my V cared about him, would take a bullet for him, and realized that he could have a whole life while she would only get another 6 months.!< 

If they could tweak the storyline you mentioned so that Johnny >!in V’s body!< is trying to find a way to >!get ahold of new bodies and save V from behind the black wall or whatever!< it would be ideal for me. 

Of course that doesn’t solve the issue of the >!suicide!< ending but that one seems hard to come back from.
It definitely would and it would work well since it would take place pre-game. 

I’m just wondering if and how the dlc’s can expand on the main story of the game since the endings would make it difficult.
    Yeah, unless they make a different path for each ending in a dlc, it would be a lot of effort for an expansion. Or they make one ending canon but then that would make every other ending kinda pointless. Although I would love to see a continuation of the main story but I think if anything they’ll do a new story with a different main character.
        Making one ending canon makes sense imo. The Panam ending is the "good" ending, and the only one with any real hope. Almost all other endings leads to the death of V.

Same situation if you give Johnny your body. It's no longer V in there, it's not "us". 

So yeah, the nomads ending seems to be the only ending with the possibility to branch out.
            Well it might be possible that V survives the space casino heist
                space casino V gave up on a cure. They live only to become the legend that will last.

Id say that Nomad ending and Arasaka ending (version where you go back to earth) are only ones that actually puts a way to find any cure.
                    But blue eyes is like, if u succeed, then he could provide a cure???
            Sorry, to chime in on an old thread but man... Those endings do not leave much hope for any sort of decent DLC continuing the story.

Making one ending "canon" completely removes player agency from the endings. I don't think the endings were very strong either.
                Yup, the endings were weak AF.  Especially if you chose to identify with Johnny.  They strip the player of all agency in the Rogue mission option, which is garbage. They give you all the agency to try and patch things up with Rogue with conversation points and decisions that lead you to a point in the mission where her and Johnny agree to start fresh together then bam! It ignores all the effort you put in up to that point and does not make use of any decision points from prior.  Hell, Mass Effect 2 and Witcher 3 allowed all these things and its strange how CDPR chose to take this weird route where they give you all this agency only to strip it away right at the end.
        Yeah it’s a tough situation because dropping people’s endings could cause even more drama, but one canon ending or a new story in the same world would make the most sense.

Either way I’m hoping for a continuation of my ending that results in a happy ending for both V and Johnny. Unrealistic, sure, but it’s my hope lol.
            My hope is that they go back to fix the endings for Johnny so that Rogue doesnt get fragged or at least put in some method where your conversation decisions/skills allow you to interrupt Smasher's sequence.  Huge missed opportunity there and really sours the game for me so much so that it makes replaying it in the current state unpalatable.
Yup, they give you agency to be a good person with reinforcing mechanisms around you from Jackie/Misty to Johnny/Rogue to V/love interest.  After 90 hours of playtime where they build you up with hope to then suddenly tear it away at every option was just not good.  I identified with Johnny through my play through and even got the bond with V pretty high so towards the point of no return i went through the heart wrenching goodbyes to Panam and then played as Johnny.  Throughout the entire mission it gives you hope that, even after 50 years, shes still in love with you as you are with her.  Right at the point where your character and her decide to start fresh everything gets smashed.  At that point, none of your choices matter and every end point is just a depressing mess.  Reading about the other endings makes it all the more depressing.

This is starting to feel like those "subverting expectations" style writing courses they try to do and the story just slaps you down hard no matter what.  Makes replayability very low as there is virtually no good outcome. Like honestly, how is Mass Effect 2 still the gold standard on this stuff after so long???  The game gave you agency to bond with characters and affect their end game while so many games continue to do this all or nothing stuff.  

I should have been able to save Rogue during the final assault instead of watching her die and in the end being Johnny where everyone i know or knew is dead is just not a good way to run a story for which you want a person to assume the identity for.
It's the thing that I got from it. Yeah the corps' greed are squeezing whatever they can from the environment and don't care if they grind everyone into dust in the process, but they haven't. With all their power and might and tech people are still people. As utterly terrifying as Night City is there is still beauty in it, people still find beauty in it that doesn't revolve around the kill or be kill mentality.

The fact that every ending is damn near kicking your feet out from under you and laughing at you for thinking that has really left a sour taste in my mouth. Got 3 of the 5 ending sequences and uninstalled. Might come back to it in a year when as much of the stuff is fixed as possible but for now think I'm done.
Johnny taking over your body and leaving the city is essentially the most positive ending, V doesn’t suffer anymore and Johnny is essentially redeemed of his douchey old ways and he moves on...
I highly doubt that DLC's will extend/explain the endings. It's most likely gonna be something like Johnny DLC or V/Jackie old days DLC.
    I don't think they'd do that tbh. I feel like any DLC might even be a separate character at this point. Pretty stupid way to end the game IMO. The problem with multiple choice endings is a DLC continuing them would most likely invalidate some of the endings... Which is I've always hated in RPGs. 

It removes player choice.
        Use your imagination Choom,  think about how the game ended it branches out in the end with the Major choices, but more or less the same outcome. 

DLC could start branched out as well.

Here how I would like to see it:
1. you load up the Brand new DLC
2. A prompt pops up and asks you what Ending you chose.
3.You choose and the game starts a a Short Prologue basically on whatever you chose but will braid your "Past" into more Linear Story DLC.

You know, like the Lifepath thing at the start, nomad, Streetkid , Corpo.. you started differently but ended up meeting Jackie, took Dexs Job, etc.etc. 

That's how this could work, but.. not every ending, like Jonny taking over wouldn't work for my Theory or possibly the Arasaka ending (? Havent played that one yet ,so please no spoilers)

In which case I would see that they would pull the same thing they did on the Blood and Wine DLC where only the "good" endings will be Cannon.

Also because I doubt they will get Keanu Reeves to Voice Jonny for a whole freaking DLC "Branch" probably expensive  as hell.
            Before you meet Hanako you get a call, to save your life and continue living, by doing so you get none of the shit ass gonk endings, canon af bruh. I will direct it 100% choom, its gonna be preem.
            >Use your imagination Choom,  think about how the game ended it branches out in the end with the Major choices, but more or less the same outcome.

So it either means that the developers have to pick an ending to be canon. Which is fucking stupid in an open ended game. Might as well not allowed for multiple endings at all in that case. Removes all player agency from the main story. Which was my point.

or

It means they have to craft some sort of DLC that incorporates all of the endings... Including the ones where Johnny takes over V's body and leaves the city. Which seems nigh impossible especially for CDprojectRed to handle correctly.

&#x200B;

I don't think they "can't" do it. I just think the endings are varied enough that they may go with Option 1. Which is super lame.
                Well I would guess that some endings would be disabled , as I said I doubt they would get Keanu into this game again expect for maybe a couple of one liners.

So I would assume that some endings are considered .. bad endings which wouldn't progress into a Story DLC.. just like the suicide one.

But the main endings , Night City Afterlife Boss and the Nomad one could very definitely be continued which like I said would simply branch out at the beginning only to twirl into a linear story just like the beginning of the game , and if you think about it, there are only 3 endings which would make sense to continue on Nomad, Afterlife Boss, and Return from the Arasaka Space station..
I mean Alt that fucking AI told us so and that shit is probably the smartest thing around in the Cyberpunk universe and if you pick the Arasaka ending the smartest brains in Arasaka reached the same conclusion so I don't really see how V can be saved if the best possible candidates for saving her life were both pretty  set on her dying in 6 months.

But there is to hoping I guess.
    That kinda ruined the game for me. I reached the point of no return tonight and upon reading about it I ended being spoiled by the whole ending. No hard feelings though, but during my playthrough I was hard focused on the main quest as I wanted to save V and save her life ASAP since this was obviously an urgency, I would then focus on the other content afterward.

Turns out that not only its a lost cause, but I'm thrown back pre point of no return after the end anyway. Which condemn me to forever be stuck with an AI slowly killing V in all my future playthrough/free roam sessions.

It sucks.
        Yup I feel you hard, exactly how I played my V and I want to feel like all my work to cure V meant something. I wanna be in night city not as someone slowly dying so I don't feel weird doing all this side content that just feels out of place for V to be doing
            This reminds me we’ll forever be plagged by the random OLD RELIC MALFUNCTION condition until the end of time since we never truly get rid of that.

Best design decision ever lol
        >Turns out that not only its a lost cause, but I'm thrown back pre point of no return after the end anyway. Which condemn me to forever be stuck with an AI slowly killing V in all my future playthrough/free roam sessions.  
>  
>It sucks.

100% this. I played a game a similar way until I got to the point of no return. Then I did all the side content but like... Most of it felt super frivolous. Let me go scuba diving while this AI is frying my mind... It doesn't make sense narratively.

I was hoping, like you, for an ending that would allow me to re-enter the world and do all the side shit after finishing the main story. But it's all tied to Johnny, which was a mistake, so I understand why they did it the way the did... CDPR has a problem with story writing this way. Witcher 3 had similar problems.
    Alt isn't the smartest thing though, she said it herself. She can't use soulkiller to its fullest capabilities after all the Arasaka changes.


Also, best candidates yet. Remember there are private networks like the voodoo boys that netwatch is trying to control. Plus, a whole unexplored world.
    Super late to the party but I would note that Alt is very deliberately *not* depicted as omniscient or flawless (She has to wipe out the Voodoo boys to save herself from Netwatch if you trust the Netwatch agent, she says she's been trying and failing to breach Mikoshi for 50 years, she obviously screws up V's diagnosis (assuming Alt wasn't lying, which we have no reason to think she was)). 

In the Arisaka ending Hellman analogizes what has happened to V as similar to the damage inflicted by radiation poisoning, but tbh that line was reasonably comforting to me: It's the year 2077 and you're telling me no one anywhere has figured out radiation poisoning, not even to mitigate it?? 

Beyond that, the reason people like the Panam ending is that it is the only ending that is geared towards leaving the player with hop: Hope for a cure, but also (and separately) hope for an escape from the dystopia they have been living in for the last 20-60 hours. I would have lived to see more ambiguity, or just flat out more hope, from the other ostensibly legitimate and good endings.
        How tf can adam smasher live looking like he does but V cant lol, there has to be a way.
            Adam's basically a complete cyber body, which is sort of why the Arisaka endings don't bother me. 

Assuming that at some point they will get the risks of a fully cyber body down to a tolerable level, then getting engram'd and then stuffed in a cyberframe later on is fine.
                One of the side missions suggests editing engrams is possible. Wouldn’t want to emerge as diet V in a new body with all negative tendencies eliminated (as defined by Arasaka).
You die no matter what. As soon as you enter mikoshi alt uses soulkiller on you and creates an engram, a copy of you. Is a copy of you really you? What makes you you?
Could be another protagonists story. I like to think that V was our introduction into the CP77 universe; or it could be early / mid-game expansions + possibly new endings who knows.
    Another protag will make all of cyberpunk feel so wasted though.. like u make ur own char, ur own choices and relationships and now u gotta make a new protag? Nah, i hope not
        What's wrong with telling multiple stories in Night city? V became a Legend, would be interesting to hear about them and maybe run into old friends time to time while you make new ones

I really liked how Gta4 did this with it's DLC, same world different stories
            Well for gta4 we still got a definitive ending for Niko, there are way too many loose ends for cyberpunk.

2. Im ok playing with another character for a sequel. The story for V seems unfinished and the devs possibly made it so open-ended for reason.
    i'm betting that they will just be addtional quests in the world, so you need to load a save before the final mission anyway.
        I feel like the story was created to make the multiplayer have respawning in the lore. I feel like the DLC will also incorporate the immortality factor after Arisaka discovers the chip works.
            Not like the cloning vats haven't been a thing in other major cyberpunk fiction. Cyberpunk is a perfect precursor to worlds like altered carbon.
Yup got the same vibe. Got the same feeling at the end of MGS when Snake gets Fox Die and Naomi says there is no way to know when he will die and he just has to live (and he does, for quite a while). Plus there are several Kojima references in the game.
damn, gonna need to try that out in a second playthrough, i only got that thing to 60%
Is this confirmed? I‘ve read varying things about supporting him throughout the game but not to the point of being a suck up.

Can‘t remember what I said at his grave. But I was stuck at 60% as well.

Actually quite looking forward to NG+ when it‘s out. Maybe together with the actual PS5 version. In that playthrough I could save Takemura as well.
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CubJ5M6aQGY&

Follow this. I reloaded a manual save, followed these dialogue options when visiting Johnny's grave, and didn't even complete the band side quests after. My score was at 50% and I was still able to get the secret ending option to trigger. All the enemies are level 50 in that ending, though. And it doesn't really change the ending you get post-choice.
        "Doesn't really change the ending" meaning V still has 6 months to live?
            Thats, right. V still only has 6 months to live... Only thing that really changes is rogue and the nomads are still alive.
    I did it myself so I'm pretty sure it's correct unless there is another important aspect I just happened to do throughout my playthrough without realising. I was at 60% (and couldn't do the solo ending) went back a few hours re did the grave sequence with everything else the same, got to 70% and could now do the solo ending.
[removed]
    I was surprised how much the corpo lifestyle was painted as the "wrong" choice. I guess you're technically ex-corpo, but still. Got annoying at the end having Johnny pushing against it so much. I feel like a more fleshed out background system would have the corpo choice take over Arasaka to use the tech for yourself.
        [removed]
That was absolutely devastating. Really well voice acted.
    I just "finished" the game with this ending. I did not know that this would happen, as I thought, this would be a suicide attack with both being half in half in charge.  


It broke my heart. I am not happy with this one bit....  


But then again, while I would choose the Panam ending with Judy by my side, I do not see a reason why I would risk my new found family with such an attack on Arasaka.  


Especially when I played a sneaking, hacking V, I would have liked to get an option to do this on my own terms so to speak.  


I will most likely not go back to play with this character again.   
As all the other options now seems cheesy for me.   
Gonna start a new character I guess and then go with Panam and Judy.

But this incarnation of V .. well, she killed herself.... even if I would no have wanted this to happen and it not making sense in my headcanon on how I played her :/  
Well, can´t win it all everytime, tough luck I guess.
He is now immortal which is probably the worst scenario out of any.

If you take the Johnny or Nomad endings, Arasaka basically falls into ruins.
> I mean the point of the story is more about the journey than the end

V even says this multiple times through the game.
I don't know, I still didn't finish the game but I already feel awful, I knew that it won't be a "happy game" but in my foolishness I hoped that my choice will matter a little more. 

I wonder... maybe it wouldn't hit me that hard if the 2020 was different, but with how it was, I wish that at least I could do some "happy endings" for other characters...
That's the strongest hint to the contract actually saving your life imo. Dialogue and lore can be argued but it makes a lot of sense thematically and narratively. 

I just disagree with the game's implications that you really betray that much.
Nope. Cause the Arasaka ending does not mean you live on, Takamura tells you himself that the surgery did not save you and that you only have a  few months left. 

Your only choice at this point is to go back to Earth, as a half-lobotomized shadow of yourself and die in a few months.....

Or to upload a copy of yourself to Mikoshi, while your original body will die and you sign yourself and all your rights over to Arasaka. A cruel twist on the promise of "saving" your life. 

The Arasaka endings are the worst possible outcomes. Cause you neither have a blaze of glory, nor did you save your own life. 

The Arasaka ending needs a complete rewrite: they save your worthless ass and "kill" Johnny. You should be rewarded with a corner office in the Arasaka corp, as another faceless stooge bound to them. Now you got your "long life", if you wanna call that a life. It would have fit your betrayal and the desire to save yourself way better and would have been in line with the "Survival at any cost" playstyle.

They also should have allowed us to betray Arasaka in the scene in the tower and let us kill Yorinobu, his sister and Hellman, at the cost of your own life (as an option of "last second remorse"). But I can understand the reason why they did not allow that, because by the time you are in the tower you already made your decision to trust Arasaka. A terrible mistake.
    Arisaka ending isn't the worst. It's one of the only 2 (maybe 3 if you think nomads can actually save you) endings that can potentially save V. They aren't going to keep you prisoner because they will let you leave if you want. Signing the contract is just legal shit in case they never find a way to put you back into a body. This ending can leave you "alive" at an unspecified later date. The other one being working with Mr Blue in the afterlife to do the Crystal Palace Heist because he seems to be offering V something more valuable than money (which V has a ton of at this point) meaning it could be a solution to their problem. This ending has the highest chances of a DLC because you can actually play it out.
Nope, read what the creator had to say in an interview from Dec 2020 (also my character is not a terrorist like Johnny):

“*Cyberpunk* is political, but it’s not political in a  blue-state-red-state-conservative-liberal \[way\],” he says. “It is  basically \[that\] people deserve to be able to get a decent meal, live in  a decent place and do all that if they’re willing to work for it, and  not get screwed over by people more powerful than they are, who may not  need to even screw them over, but are doing it on principle because they  think they can do it.”

Thankfully, in the game at least, that’s where the heroes come in. “Characters in *Cyberpunk*  are heroes, and survive and do well because they are willing to fight  for family or friends, for their neighbourhoods,” Pondsmith tells us.

That would be ok in a book, but not in a first person open world game. If everything was out of anyone's control then people like Saburo Arasaka or Morgan Blackhand would not exist.
Unlimited paths? I would be happy if one of the 7 endings was not doom and gloom.

That's what I assume
Same, I think they mean special weapons you can pick up in certain endings. I got rogues pistol and it carried over.
I heard that this happens with Judy but not River—which checks out with the fact that he’s prioritizing his family now

I’d love if that was the reality tho
    That's a shame, but i can also see why he doesn't join.

To me it seems like Female V with Judy going with Nomads is the best ending for all chars involved (well not all chars, but ones you do quest with)

River has his sister and nephews to take care off
Panam has her family now, Judy on the other hand lost pretty much everything and wants to leave Night City anyway.
        My ideal ending wouldn’t involve leaving Night City, tbf. I’d want to stay right there and spend the time with him and his family, over chasing a pipe dream in the middle of fucking nowhere.
Copies are copies. You are dead but you created a virtual copy of yourself that thinks it is alive. A real shame to the poor child
    This. A copy may have all the original properties but it’s still not the original. So even if he was copied to an engram and it didn’t still end with V dying after a few months, he was dead the minute he was killed by the soul killer and *copied*.
        That's the thing though we still haven't define what consciousness really is, if it is simply the neurons firing in our brains then, a 1 to 1 copy of that is by definition your consciousness, if an engram simply scans the brain and converts it into an AI then it complicates the problem even more because we don't even know what a conscious AI look like let alone how it works.
            Even if you would consider engram a conscious it would still be a duplicate.
                that the whole point of my argument, since we do not know the nature of consciousness we cant say that a copy isn't you. you cannot make claims about dying if we don't know what happens to your consciousness after you die. if a teleporter deconstructs your body in the atomic level what says that the reconstructed version is still you, we do not know the nature of consciousness in our universe, until it is defined then you cannot claim otherwise. if engram V remembers how he or she became an engram then what makes her a duplicate?
                    In my view it’s not about if the engram is the actual person or not. It’s all about instances for example you can create an instance of a new process on a computer ok now let’s go further and spawn the exact same process again it’s not the same instance. Now if we were to kill the original instance you would be left with a copy that is not the original instance but exactly the same in every regard. My point is the original instance is dead regardless of the perfect copy still running. I hope I clarified my point.
Having played Cyberpunk, the framing.

Unless you mean conceptually, if you ask people if the human lifespan should be increased, they'll likely say no, having accepted that death is a part of "life" despite technology also being part of it.
They call it soul killer because it's doing exactly what it's named after.

You can't just transfer what makes you "you" into the digital realm. That's not how consciousness works.

The engram would be you for all intents and purposes, and act like you would, change like you would, but when you go in you die. The copy of you is "born", and has a discrete life from that point on.

That's why some would prescribe those machines as evil. If employed en masse, they would commit genocides to create an army of engrams, all corporate property of Arasaka. "don't worry, the law will catch up and recognize engrams as people" was very disconcerting.
You don't get stuck in Mikoshi, that's not what Hellman says. Arasaka has a service for extremely rich clients who want to be immortal via body-hoping, it's called Secure Your Soul. That's what the contract is. You'll be in Mikoshi until they find a compatible body to give you. Then you'll live again. 

On the other hand joining Alt beyond the Blackwall does mean you'll be there "forever". Which is technically not really dying, since your mind will keep existing there, but you're also gone from the physical world for all intents and purposes.

        Getting a new body because yours can't be saved is why they're offering the contract in the first place though. And I'm pretty sure the offer is free, you didn't pay for removing the biochip or the weeks of treatment either, and they don't mention a price with the contract either. 

You make an agreement that they stop you from dying in exchange for helping them retake control from the traitor son. You did your part and it seems like they're doing theirs. They let you leave no questions asked if you don't sign, makes no sense to only betray you if you sign and be cool with you if you don't.

                I agree it's left vague af, just seems to me like the whole point of that ending is that you live in exchange for giving up the fight and all. Like in the opposite ending where you attack them, you're fighting the megacorp and become a legend, but you die. It's more narratively and thematically fitting if the ending where you surrender yourself to them actually saves your life, but at the cost of everything else. Ideals vs life.
                    [deleted]
> a more fleshe

But if you join the "Save your Soul Program", don't you technically live on forever? With the slim possibility of being brought back in the future.
    [deleted]
        also don't forget... what if Arasaka never solves the body rejection issue?  Or if you get new leadership at Arasaka that believes you are too much of a loose end to revive?  Going into Mikoshi is one of the darkest potential endings imo.
Well it's a dystopia it's no different than watching my favourite tv show and at the end of 30 episode my favourite character gets killed off. It is supposed to be depressing, hell if they added an ending that is by our standard "happy" kinda breaks the immersion of the whole fucked up world the cyberpunk universe is. A good story is one that makes the reader think the meaning behind it themselves and not spoonfed in a silver platter. 

Not saying you are wrong, I was pissed when I found out v dies in every single situation that is why I say the arasaka ending is the best one it gives V a second chance.
    I like the idea of it, but from the presentation it feels pretty clear the writers intended for it to be a bad ending.

It could have been a more cyberpunk ending if a transcendence ending happened more like the Ghost in the Shell movie. Like instead of just Johnny or just V, there's a synthesis. There was a lot of foreshadowing for synthesis but it just never happened.

IMO a real good, bad ending, could have been V becoming the next Adam Smasher, a full chrome corpo hitman. A complete subversion of what Johnny was fighting against. You become the oppressor.
        The game has a theme of ideals being bigger than just living, and the Arasaka contract is presented like giving up your ideals to live. Even though you can roleplay through dialogue that this isn't what V wants. Jackie talked about wanting to be a Legend, with a drink named after him. I never did. I don't care. 

Even becoming an Arasaka enforcer in exchange for living wouldn't necessarily be that bad. Takemura was an alright dude. Smasher is an asshole but he was always like that, being a cyborg or a corpo didn't change him.
I mean like, if your life is being the top edgerunner it might not be as spectacular as soloing a private army and blowing a top secret basé but it's not exactly a quiet life either.
I mean, I get that, but my point is that in order to get a somewhat hopeful ending you have to abandon the main organic narrative and do *her* sidequest, despite the fact you barely hear/see her again after her branch in the main story.
    All the "character-arc" sidequests are like that. For Judy, River, Panam.. hell, even the one for Johnny. Or the one for Jackie's funeral.  It is a question of friendship - if you consider that character someone worthwhile, a friend - you take time to do them. For me it was pretty organic, especially considering Panam as romance option.
    That’s one way to view it. But you could also say that Johnny and Rogue represent the trap of Night City, they’re legends in their own right and you can become one too... but look at the cost they paid. And Jackie paid. And every street kid pays pursuing that goal. 

Choosing the Nomads IS a bit random, because it’s you breaking that cycle. Potentially for the better.
I understand what you're saying but i disagree with your assetment of the game's theme. This wasnt Johnny's story, it was V's. Leaving the soul sucking corporate Night City for the road with Panam feels more like canon.
    Depends on how you view the story - Is it a redemption arc in which V learns it's not about where you end up, but the people you love (Nomad ending)? Or is it a rags to riches story where V finally, and at a great cost, becomes the greatest merc in all of night city?
        Yeah, it depends. The rags to riches is pushed heavily. The whole reason was to become the king of Night City. 

After it sucks you up and spits you out though, I like the redemption/nomad arc.
            
Interesting - I tried both endings as of yesterday and I strongly feel the rags to riches ending felt better. I barely wanted to finish the nomad ending for my street kid V who wanted to be a legend. I think it purely depends on what WE want for our Vs!
    We are in agreement, I was referring specifically to the quest itself.
Makes sense cuz in the beginning the street kid went to Atlanta hoping it was better than NC. After being burned by the city life, it’d make sense to go nomad.
Kerry has a real life and a career outside of you. River has his family. It makes sense that neither of them drop their whole everything to come on your escape, just like it makes sense for Judy to quit Night City and leave with you.

I don't see how it's a stab at the Aldecaldos that neither Kerry or River come with you; they're not the nomad's family. You are.
    Never said it was a stab at the Aldecaldos, I said it was a gut punch to me, because I'd grown to like Kerry and his relationship with V during my playthrough, I was sad that I had to leave him behind.
    Which is why the female V with Judy in the Panam ending is the best to me - it gets the most good people out of NC and happy.
I'm so pissed about this ending. It doesn't feel like the good ending everyone said it was. Your boyfriend leaves you and you get a bunch of good people killed, all so you can live 6 months more. Honestly wtf? I was somehow happy with the game despite the bugs but this has left a bad taste in my mouth I can't shake. I even felt a strong emotional/ friendship connection to Panam, but still. Ugh.

Edit: extra words
\>This sub feels so toxic to be on. Feels like there is no place to be enthausiastic about this game.

    Hey, I noticed you're account is kind of new, just so you know, you don't need to put a sub's URL to link to it, just r/ and the subs name works, in your case r/lowsodiumcyberpunk
the characters were nice. I think River needed more to his questlines, but hes still likeable. I didn't think I'd like everyone as much as I did, so I agree. The story line itself is good too. Only wished for some finer details in some areas, but hopefully if they do a dlc it will expand on the characters we got attached to.
    Yeah River was my first romance of the bunch, figured I'd do separate playthroughs with the others later. He's honestly pretty cool, and I'd argue his side job quest line was both quite disturbing and also very well done. Probably one of my favorites. Panam's questline was definitely quite fun too, and the first time I got to test run the Basilisk, I got pretty hype lol. Sadly, I didn't finish up all of Judy's before I beat the game, but I'll probably just go back before the endgame sequence and wait out a day to finish. She seems pretty cool too.

That's definitely something I hope they do as well: flesh out the romance options/characters more. Gonna be a while before we get DLC though, I imagine. I'm okay with that.
        I thought there'd be a little more to River's questlines, they were well done. I agree, but by doing two things with him he calls about missing V, which i don't think is fully justified since they barely know eachother, where as Panam and Judy do have longer sequences before the romance scenes. I do like the dynamic between the cop angle and a law breaking merc. I wish they played with that a little more. 

It would be cool to have new romances as well, given i guess some can break it off with you depending on what ending you go with. It'll be interesting how they tie everything together.
I did the Panam ending and on the end credit scene, Takemura San told me to go to hell. I saved him and all. Anyone got this too?
Sad endings aren't necessarily garbage though. The first ending I tried was the suicide one and... it's probably the worst but it was quite powerful and well made. Its message might seem quite obvious but it's one that is always good to remember: suicide is not difficult for the one committing it... it's hard for the ones left behind and that have to keep on living (which is paradoxical because V choses this end because it's the "least bloody"... except he/she didn't factor in the pain and despair).
Yeah all the other endings just felt depressing, but Panam's ending actually felt good, it gave me hope about V's survival. But yeah again i really hope this ending is canon
not necessarily. [you missed an ending.](https://youtu.be/UIi-Ufnvkg0?t=144) :)

spoilers, obviously. >!this ending is insanely difficult. i came in with my overpowered build at level 44 doing 10,000+ damage per bullet with a smart SMG and had to crank the difficulty down to easy to pull it off. the enemies are bullet sponges who will 1-2 shot you depending on build and if you die during it, counts as the suicide ending and rolls credits, meaning you have to give up or redo the whole ending sequence up to that point. balls hard challenge run.!<
I felt the confusion in your comment xD
    I was like that went from 0-100 so fast I got whiplash 😂
        Yeah johnny is edgy.
definitely not coming back as V from that ending.


just did this ending last night and felt like an asshole lol
    Ya both Jude and panam leaves u, while the male ones actually stay in the ending (vice versa if it's the panam ending)
        spoilers

&#x200B;

Jude and panam left me, I did the finish with arkasia - but seems they were done with me way before then, even after finishing their stories
            Ya no one likes the arisaka ending
        for me, i had no relationships and never finished panam/judy storyline.


they both left messages in the credits asking me to call them sometime but acted like i was too busy/famous for them now.


dunno if the credit messages change depending on relations.
            [deleted]
                > because they all said something like "Ah, voice mail again

I got the ending with Panam and only Rogue said that in the credits
            Well you are among the top dogs in blaze of glory ending, plus might be super busy bcoz of the casino lmao.
isnt dont fear the reaper the secret one?
    Ya I think so, bcoz u literally walk in the front door and nobody dies
Yeah, unless they make a different path for each ending in a dlc, it would be a lot of effort for an expansion. Or they make one ending canon but then that would make every other ending kinda pointless. Although I would love to see a continuation of the main story but I think if anything they’ll do a new story with a different main character.
    Making one ending canon makes sense imo. The Panam ending is the "good" ending, and the only one with any real hope. Almost all other endings leads to the death of V.

Same situation if you give Johnny your body. It's no longer V in there, it's not "us". 

So yeah, the nomads ending seems to be the only ending with the possibility to branch out.
        Well it might be possible that V survives the space casino heist
            space casino V gave up on a cure. They live only to become the legend that will last.

Id say that Nomad ending and Arasaka ending (version where you go back to earth) are only ones that actually puts a way to find any cure.
                But blue eyes is like, if u succeed, then he could provide a cure???
        Sorry, to chime in on an old thread but man... Those endings do not leave much hope for any sort of decent DLC continuing the story.

Making one ending "canon" completely removes player agency from the endings. I don't think the endings were very strong either.
            Yup, the endings were weak AF.  Especially if you chose to identify with Johnny.  They strip the player of all agency in the Rogue mission option, which is garbage. They give you all the agency to try and patch things up with Rogue with conversation points and decisions that lead you to a point in the mission where her and Johnny agree to start fresh together then bam! It ignores all the effort you put in up to that point and does not make use of any decision points from prior.  Hell, Mass Effect 2 and Witcher 3 allowed all these things and its strange how CDPR chose to take this weird route where they give you all this agency only to strip it away right at the end.
    Yeah it’s a tough situation because dropping people’s endings could cause even more drama, but one canon ending or a new story in the same world would make the most sense.

Either way I’m hoping for a continuation of my ending that results in a happy ending for both V and Johnny. Unrealistic, sure, but it’s my hope lol.
        My hope is that they go back to fix the endings for Johnny so that Rogue doesnt get fragged or at least put in some method where your conversation decisions/skills allow you to interrupt Smasher's sequence.  Huge missed opportunity there and really sours the game for me so much so that it makes replaying it in the current state unpalatable.
I don't think they'd do that tbh. I feel like any DLC might even be a separate character at this point. Pretty stupid way to end the game IMO. The problem with multiple choice endings is a DLC continuing them would most likely invalidate some of the endings... Which is I've always hated in RPGs. 

It removes player choice.
    Use your imagination Choom,  think about how the game ended it branches out in the end with the Major choices, but more or less the same outcome. 

DLC could start branched out as well.

Here how I would like to see it:
1. you load up the Brand new DLC
2. A prompt pops up and asks you what Ending you chose.
3.You choose and the game starts a a Short Prologue basically on whatever you chose but will braid your "Past" into more Linear Story DLC.

You know, like the Lifepath thing at the start, nomad, Streetkid , Corpo.. you started differently but ended up meeting Jackie, took Dexs Job, etc.etc. 

That's how this could work, but.. not every ending, like Jonny taking over wouldn't work for my Theory or possibly the Arasaka ending (? Havent played that one yet ,so please no spoilers)

In which case I would see that they would pull the same thing they did on the Blood and Wine DLC where only the "good" endings will be Cannon.

Also because I doubt they will get Keanu Reeves to Voice Jonny for a whole freaking DLC "Branch" probably expensive  as hell.
        Before you meet Hanako you get a call, to save your life and continue living, by doing so you get none of the shit ass gonk endings, canon af bruh. I will direct it 100% choom, its gonna be preem.
        >Use your imagination Choom,  think about how the game ended it branches out in the end with the Major choices, but more or less the same outcome.

So it either means that the developers have to pick an ending to be canon. Which is fucking stupid in an open ended game. Might as well not allowed for multiple endings at all in that case. Removes all player agency from the main story. Which was my point.

or

It means they have to craft some sort of DLC that incorporates all of the endings... Including the ones where Johnny takes over V's body and leaves the city. Which seems nigh impossible especially for CDprojectRed to handle correctly.

&#x200B;

I don't think they "can't" do it. I just think the endings are varied enough that they may go with Option 1. Which is super lame.
            Well I would guess that some endings would be disabled , as I said I doubt they would get Keanu into this game again expect for maybe a couple of one liners.

So I would assume that some endings are considered .. bad endings which wouldn't progress into a Story DLC.. just like the suicide one.

But the main endings , Night City Afterlife Boss and the Nomad one could very definitely be continued which like I said would simply branch out at the beginning only to twirl into a linear story just like the beginning of the game , and if you think about it, there are only 3 endings which would make sense to continue on Nomad, Afterlife Boss, and Return from the Arasaka Space station..
That kinda ruined the game for me. I reached the point of no return tonight and upon reading about it I ended being spoiled by the whole ending. No hard feelings though, but during my playthrough I was hard focused on the main quest as I wanted to save V and save her life ASAP since this was obviously an urgency, I would then focus on the other content afterward.

Turns out that not only its a lost cause, but I'm thrown back pre point of no return after the end anyway. Which condemn me to forever be stuck with an AI slowly killing V in all my future playthrough/free roam sessions.

It sucks.
    Yup I feel you hard, exactly how I played my V and I want to feel like all my work to cure V meant something. I wanna be in night city not as someone slowly dying so I don't feel weird doing all this side content that just feels out of place for V to be doing
        This reminds me we’ll forever be plagged by the random OLD RELIC MALFUNCTION condition until the end of time since we never truly get rid of that.

Best design decision ever lol
    >Turns out that not only its a lost cause, but I'm thrown back pre point of no return after the end anyway. Which condemn me to forever be stuck with an AI slowly killing V in all my future playthrough/free roam sessions.  
>  
>It sucks.

100% this. I played a game a similar way until I got to the point of no return. Then I did all the side content but like... Most of it felt super frivolous. Let me go scuba diving while this AI is frying my mind... It doesn't make sense narratively.

I was hoping, like you, for an ending that would allow me to re-enter the world and do all the side shit after finishing the main story. But it's all tied to Johnny, which was a mistake, so I understand why they did it the way the did... CDPR has a problem with story writing this way. Witcher 3 had similar problems.
Alt isn't the smartest thing though, she said it herself. She can't use soulkiller to its fullest capabilities after all the Arasaka changes.


Also, best candidates yet. Remember there are private networks like the voodoo boys that netwatch is trying to control. Plus, a whole unexplored world.
Super late to the party but I would note that Alt is very deliberately *not* depicted as omniscient or flawless (She has to wipe out the Voodoo boys to save herself from Netwatch if you trust the Netwatch agent, she says she's been trying and failing to breach Mikoshi for 50 years, she obviously screws up V's diagnosis (assuming Alt wasn't lying, which we have no reason to think she was)). 

In the Arisaka ending Hellman analogizes what has happened to V as similar to the damage inflicted by radiation poisoning, but tbh that line was reasonably comforting to me: It's the year 2077 and you're telling me no one anywhere has figured out radiation poisoning, not even to mitigate it?? 

Beyond that, the reason people like the Panam ending is that it is the only ending that is geared towards leaving the player with hop: Hope for a cure, but also (and separately) hope for an escape from the dystopia they have been living in for the last 20-60 hours. I would have lived to see more ambiguity, or just flat out more hope, from the other ostensibly legitimate and good endings.
    How tf can adam smasher live looking like he does but V cant lol, there has to be a way.
        Adam's basically a complete cyber body, which is sort of why the Arisaka endings don't bother me. 

Assuming that at some point they will get the risks of a fully cyber body down to a tolerable level, then getting engram'd and then stuffed in a cyberframe later on is fine.
            One of the side missions suggests editing engrams is possible. Wouldn’t want to emerge as diet V in a new body with all negative tendencies eliminated (as defined by Arasaka).
Another protag will make all of cyberpunk feel so wasted though.. like u make ur own char, ur own choices and relationships and now u gotta make a new protag? Nah, i hope not
    What's wrong with telling multiple stories in Night city? V became a Legend, would be interesting to hear about them and maybe run into old friends time to time while you make new ones

I really liked how Gta4 did this with it's DLC, same world different stories
        Well for gta4 we still got a definitive ending for Niko, there are way too many loose ends for cyberpunk.

2. Im ok playing with another character for a sequel. The story for V seems unfinished and the devs possibly made it so open-ended for reason.
i'm betting that they will just be addtional quests in the world, so you need to load a save before the final mission anyway.
    I feel like the story was created to make the multiplayer have respawning in the lore. I feel like the DLC will also incorporate the immortality factor after Arisaka discovers the chip works.
        Not like the cloning vats haven't been a thing in other major cyberpunk fiction. Cyberpunk is a perfect precursor to worlds like altered carbon.

Follow this. I reloaded a manual save, followed these dialogue options when visiting Johnny's grave, and didn't even complete the band side quests after. My score was at 50% and I was still able to get the secret ending option to trigger. All the enemies are level 50 in that ending, though. And it doesn't really change the ending you get post-choice.
    "Doesn't really change the ending" meaning V still has 6 months to live?
        Thats, right. V still only has 6 months to live... Only thing that really changes is rogue and the nomads are still alive.
I did it myself so I'm pretty sure it's correct unless there is another important aspect I just happened to do throughout my playthrough without realising. I was at 60% (and couldn't do the solo ending) went back a few hours re did the grave sequence with everything else the same, got to 70% and could now do the solo ending.
I was surprised how much the corpo lifestyle was painted as the "wrong" choice. I guess you're technically ex-corpo, but still. Got annoying at the end having Johnny pushing against it so much. I feel like a more fleshed out background system would have the corpo choice take over Arasaka to use the tech for yourself.

I just "finished" the game with this ending. I did not know that this would happen, as I thought, this would be a suicide attack with both being half in half in charge.  


It broke my heart. I am not happy with this one bit....  


But then again, while I would choose the Panam ending with Judy by my side, I do not see a reason why I would risk my new found family with such an attack on Arasaka.  


Especially when I played a sneaking, hacking V, I would have liked to get an option to do this on my own terms so to speak.  


I will most likely not go back to play with this character again.   
As all the other options now seems cheesy for me.   
Gonna start a new character I guess and then go with Panam and Judy.

But this incarnation of V .. well, she killed herself.... even if I would no have wanted this to happen and it not making sense in my headcanon on how I played her :/  
Well, can´t win it all everytime, tough luck I guess.
Arisaka ending isn't the worst. It's one of the only 2 (maybe 3 if you think nomads can actually save you) endings that can potentially save V. They aren't going to keep you prisoner because they will let you leave if you want. Signing the contract is just legal shit in case they never find a way to put you back into a body. This ending can leave you "alive" at an unspecified later date. The other one being working with Mr Blue in the afterlife to do the Crystal Palace Heist because he seems to be offering V something more valuable than money (which V has a ton of at this point) meaning it could be a solution to their problem. This ending has the highest chances of a DLC because you can actually play it out.
That's a shame, but i can also see why he doesn't join.

To me it seems like Female V with Judy going with Nomads is the best ending for all chars involved (well not all chars, but ones you do quest with)

River has his sister and nephews to take care off
Panam has her family now, Judy on the other hand lost pretty much everything and wants to leave Night City anyway.
    My ideal ending wouldn’t involve leaving Night City, tbf. I’d want to stay right there and spend the time with him and his family, over chasing a pipe dream in the middle of fucking nowhere.
This. A copy may have all the original properties but it’s still not the original. So even if he was copied to an engram and it didn’t still end with V dying after a few months, he was dead the minute he was killed by the soul killer and *copied*.
    That's the thing though we still haven't define what consciousness really is, if it is simply the neurons firing in our brains then, a 1 to 1 copy of that is by definition your consciousness, if an engram simply scans the brain and converts it into an AI then it complicates the problem even more because we don't even know what a conscious AI look like let alone how it works.
        Even if you would consider engram a conscious it would still be a duplicate.
            that the whole point of my argument, since we do not know the nature of consciousness we cant say that a copy isn't you. you cannot make claims about dying if we don't know what happens to your consciousness after you die. if a teleporter deconstructs your body in the atomic level what says that the reconstructed version is still you, we do not know the nature of consciousness in our universe, until it is defined then you cannot claim otherwise. if engram V remembers how he or she became an engram then what makes her a duplicate?
                In my view it’s not about if the engram is the actual person or not. It’s all about instances for example you can create an instance of a new process on a computer ok now let’s go further and spawn the exact same process again it’s not the same instance. Now if we were to kill the original instance you would be left with a copy that is not the original instance but exactly the same in every regard. My point is the original instance is dead regardless of the perfect copy still running. I hope I clarified my point.

    Getting a new body because yours can't be saved is why they're offering the contract in the first place though. And I'm pretty sure the offer is free, you didn't pay for removing the biochip or the weeks of treatment either, and they don't mention a price with the contract either. 

You make an agreement that they stop you from dying in exchange for helping them retake control from the traitor son. You did your part and it seems like they're doing theirs. They let you leave no questions asked if you don't sign, makes no sense to only betray you if you sign and be cool with you if you don't.

            I agree it's left vague af, just seems to me like the whole point of that ending is that you live in exchange for giving up the fight and all. Like in the opposite ending where you attack them, you're fighting the megacorp and become a legend, but you die. It's more narratively and thematically fitting if the ending where you surrender yourself to them actually saves your life, but at the cost of everything else. Ideals vs life.

    also don't forget... what if Arasaka never solves the body rejection issue?  Or if you get new leadership at Arasaka that believes you are too much of a loose end to revive?  Going into Mikoshi is one of the darkest potential endings imo.
I like the idea of it, but from the presentation it feels pretty clear the writers intended for it to be a bad ending.

It could have been a more cyberpunk ending if a transcendence ending happened more like the Ghost in the Shell movie. Like instead of just Johnny or just V, there's a synthesis. There was a lot of foreshadowing for synthesis but it just never happened.

IMO a real good, bad ending, could have been V becoming the next Adam Smasher, a full chrome corpo hitman. A complete subversion of what Johnny was fighting against. You become the oppressor.
    The game has a theme of ideals being bigger than just living, and the Arasaka contract is presented like giving up your ideals to live. Even though you can roleplay through dialogue that this isn't what V wants. Jackie talked about wanting to be a Legend, with a drink named after him. I never did. I don't care. 

Even becoming an Arasaka enforcer in exchange for living wouldn't necessarily be that bad. Takemura was an alright dude. Smasher is an asshole but he was always like that, being a cyborg or a corpo didn't change him.
All the "character-arc" sidequests are like that. For Judy, River, Panam.. hell, even the one for Johnny. Or the one for Jackie's funeral.  It is a question of friendship - if you consider that character someone worthwhile, a friend - you take time to do them. For me it was pretty organic, especially considering Panam as romance option.
That’s one way to view it. But you could also say that Johnny and Rogue represent the trap of Night City, they’re legends in their own right and you can become one too... but look at the cost they paid. And Jackie paid. And every street kid pays pursuing that goal. 

Choosing the Nomads IS a bit random, because it’s you breaking that cycle. Potentially for the better.
Depends on how you view the story - Is it a redemption arc in which V learns it's not about where you end up, but the people you love (Nomad ending)? Or is it a rags to riches story where V finally, and at a great cost, becomes the greatest merc in all of night city?
    Yeah, it depends. The rags to riches is pushed heavily. The whole reason was to become the king of Night City. 

After it sucks you up and spits you out though, I like the redemption/nomad arc.
        
Interesting - I tried both endings as of yesterday and I strongly feel the rags to riches ending felt better. I barely wanted to finish the nomad ending for my street kid V who wanted to be a legend. I think it purely depends on what WE want for our Vs!
We are in agreement, I was referring specifically to the quest itself.
Never said it was a stab at the Aldecaldos, I said it was a gut punch to me, because I'd grown to like Kerry and his relationship with V during my playthrough, I was sad that I had to leave him behind.
Which is why the female V with Judy in the Panam ending is the best to me - it gets the most good people out of NC and happy.
Hey, I noticed you're account is kind of new, just so you know, you don't need to put a sub's URL to link to it, just r/ and the subs name works, in your case r/lowsodiumcyberpunk
Yeah River was my first romance of the bunch, figured I'd do separate playthroughs with the others later. He's honestly pretty cool, and I'd argue his side job quest line was both quite disturbing and also very well done. Probably one of my favorites. Panam's questline was definitely quite fun too, and the first time I got to test run the Basilisk, I got pretty hype lol. Sadly, I didn't finish up all of Judy's before I beat the game, but I'll probably just go back before the endgame sequence and wait out a day to finish. She seems pretty cool too.

That's definitely something I hope they do as well: flesh out the romance options/characters more. Gonna be a while before we get DLC though, I imagine. I'm okay with that.
    I thought there'd be a little more to River's questlines, they were well done. I agree, but by doing two things with him he calls about missing V, which i don't think is fully justified since they barely know eachother, where as Panam and Judy do have longer sequences before the romance scenes. I do like the dynamic between the cop angle and a law breaking merc. I wish they played with that a little more. 

It would be cool to have new romances as well, given i guess some can break it off with you depending on what ending you go with. It'll be interesting how they tie everything together.
I was like that went from 0-100 so fast I got whiplash 😂
    Yeah johnny is edgy.
Ya both Jude and panam leaves u, while the male ones actually stay in the ending (vice versa if it's the panam ending)
    spoilers

&#x200B;

Jude and panam left me, I did the finish with arkasia - but seems they were done with me way before then, even after finishing their stories
        Ya no one likes the arisaka ending
    for me, i had no relationships and never finished panam/judy storyline.


they both left messages in the credits asking me to call them sometime but acted like i was too busy/famous for them now.


dunno if the credit messages change depending on relations.
        [deleted]
            > because they all said something like "Ah, voice mail again

I got the ending with Panam and only Rogue said that in the credits
        Well you are among the top dogs in blaze of glory ending, plus might be super busy bcoz of the casino lmao.
Ya I think so, bcoz u literally walk in the front door and nobody dies
Making one ending canon makes sense imo. The Panam ending is the "good" ending, and the only one with any real hope. Almost all other endings leads to the death of V.

Same situation if you give Johnny your body. It's no longer V in there, it's not "us". 

So yeah, the nomads ending seems to be the only ending with the possibility to branch out.
    Well it might be possible that V survives the space casino heist
        space casino V gave up on a cure. They live only to become the legend that will last.

Id say that Nomad ending and Arasaka ending (version where you go back to earth) are only ones that actually puts a way to find any cure.
            But blue eyes is like, if u succeed, then he could provide a cure???
    Sorry, to chime in on an old thread but man... Those endings do not leave much hope for any sort of decent DLC continuing the story.

Making one ending "canon" completely removes player agency from the endings. I don't think the endings were very strong either.
        Yup, the endings were weak AF.  Especially if you chose to identify with Johnny.  They strip the player of all agency in the Rogue mission option, which is garbage. They give you all the agency to try and patch things up with Rogue with conversation points and decisions that lead you to a point in the mission where her and Johnny agree to start fresh together then bam! It ignores all the effort you put in up to that point and does not make use of any decision points from prior.  Hell, Mass Effect 2 and Witcher 3 allowed all these things and its strange how CDPR chose to take this weird route where they give you all this agency only to strip it away right at the end.
Yeah it’s a tough situation because dropping people’s endings could cause even more drama, but one canon ending or a new story in the same world would make the most sense.

Either way I’m hoping for a continuation of my ending that results in a happy ending for both V and Johnny. Unrealistic, sure, but it’s my hope lol.
    My hope is that they go back to fix the endings for Johnny so that Rogue doesnt get fragged or at least put in some method where your conversation decisions/skills allow you to interrupt Smasher's sequence.  Huge missed opportunity there and really sours the game for me so much so that it makes replaying it in the current state unpalatable.
Use your imagination Choom,  think about how the game ended it branches out in the end with the Major choices, but more or less the same outcome. 

DLC could start branched out as well.

Here how I would like to see it:
1. you load up the Brand new DLC
2. A prompt pops up and asks you what Ending you chose.
3.You choose and the game starts a a Short Prologue basically on whatever you chose but will braid your "Past" into more Linear Story DLC.

You know, like the Lifepath thing at the start, nomad, Streetkid , Corpo.. you started differently but ended up meeting Jackie, took Dexs Job, etc.etc. 

That's how this could work, but.. not every ending, like Jonny taking over wouldn't work for my Theory or possibly the Arasaka ending (? Havent played that one yet ,so please no spoilers)

In which case I would see that they would pull the same thing they did on the Blood and Wine DLC where only the "good" endings will be Cannon.

Also because I doubt they will get Keanu Reeves to Voice Jonny for a whole freaking DLC "Branch" probably expensive  as hell.
    Before you meet Hanako you get a call, to save your life and continue living, by doing so you get none of the shit ass gonk endings, canon af bruh. I will direct it 100% choom, its gonna be preem.
    >Use your imagination Choom,  think about how the game ended it branches out in the end with the Major choices, but more or less the same outcome.

So it either means that the developers have to pick an ending to be canon. Which is fucking stupid in an open ended game. Might as well not allowed for multiple endings at all in that case. Removes all player agency from the main story. Which was my point.

or

It means they have to craft some sort of DLC that incorporates all of the endings... Including the ones where Johnny takes over V's body and leaves the city. Which seems nigh impossible especially for CDprojectRed to handle correctly.

&#x200B;

I don't think they "can't" do it. I just think the endings are varied enough that they may go with Option 1. Which is super lame.
        Well I would guess that some endings would be disabled , as I said I doubt they would get Keanu into this game again expect for maybe a couple of one liners.

So I would assume that some endings are considered .. bad endings which wouldn't progress into a Story DLC.. just like the suicide one.

But the main endings , Night City Afterlife Boss and the Nomad one could very definitely be continued which like I said would simply branch out at the beginning only to twirl into a linear story just like the beginning of the game , and if you think about it, there are only 3 endings which would make sense to continue on Nomad, Afterlife Boss, and Return from the Arasaka Space station..
Yup I feel you hard, exactly how I played my V and I want to feel like all my work to cure V meant something. I wanna be in night city not as someone slowly dying so I don't feel weird doing all this side content that just feels out of place for V to be doing
    This reminds me we’ll forever be plagged by the random OLD RELIC MALFUNCTION condition until the end of time since we never truly get rid of that.

Best design decision ever lol
>Turns out that not only its a lost cause, but I'm thrown back pre point of no return after the end anyway. Which condemn me to forever be stuck with an AI slowly killing V in all my future playthrough/free roam sessions.  
>  
>It sucks.

100% this. I played a game a similar way until I got to the point of no return. Then I did all the side content but like... Most of it felt super frivolous. Let me go scuba diving while this AI is frying my mind... It doesn't make sense narratively.

I was hoping, like you, for an ending that would allow me to re-enter the world and do all the side shit after finishing the main story. But it's all tied to Johnny, which was a mistake, so I understand why they did it the way the did... CDPR has a problem with story writing this way. Witcher 3 had similar problems.
How tf can adam smasher live looking like he does but V cant lol, there has to be a way.
    Adam's basically a complete cyber body, which is sort of why the Arisaka endings don't bother me. 

Assuming that at some point they will get the risks of a fully cyber body down to a tolerable level, then getting engram'd and then stuffed in a cyberframe later on is fine.
        One of the side missions suggests editing engrams is possible. Wouldn’t want to emerge as diet V in a new body with all negative tendencies eliminated (as defined by Arasaka).
What's wrong with telling multiple stories in Night city? V became a Legend, would be interesting to hear about them and maybe run into old friends time to time while you make new ones

I really liked how Gta4 did this with it's DLC, same world different stories
    Well for gta4 we still got a definitive ending for Niko, there are way too many loose ends for cyberpunk.

2. Im ok playing with another character for a sequel. The story for V seems unfinished and the devs possibly made it so open-ended for reason.
I feel like the story was created to make the multiplayer have respawning in the lore. I feel like the DLC will also incorporate the immortality factor after Arisaka discovers the chip works.
    Not like the cloning vats haven't been a thing in other major cyberpunk fiction. Cyberpunk is a perfect precursor to worlds like altered carbon.
"Doesn't really change the ending" meaning V still has 6 months to live?
    Thats, right. V still only has 6 months to live... Only thing that really changes is rogue and the nomads are still alive.
[removed]
My ideal ending wouldn’t involve leaving Night City, tbf. I’d want to stay right there and spend the time with him and his family, over chasing a pipe dream in the middle of fucking nowhere.
That's the thing though we still haven't define what consciousness really is, if it is simply the neurons firing in our brains then, a 1 to 1 copy of that is by definition your consciousness, if an engram simply scans the brain and converts it into an AI then it complicates the problem even more because we don't even know what a conscious AI look like let alone how it works.
    Even if you would consider engram a conscious it would still be a duplicate.
        that the whole point of my argument, since we do not know the nature of consciousness we cant say that a copy isn't you. you cannot make claims about dying if we don't know what happens to your consciousness after you die. if a teleporter deconstructs your body in the atomic level what says that the reconstructed version is still you, we do not know the nature of consciousness in our universe, until it is defined then you cannot claim otherwise. if engram V remembers how he or she became an engram then what makes her a duplicate?
            In my view it’s not about if the engram is the actual person or not. It’s all about instances for example you can create an instance of a new process on a computer ok now let’s go further and spawn the exact same process again it’s not the same instance. Now if we were to kill the original instance you would be left with a copy that is not the original instance but exactly the same in every regard. My point is the original instance is dead regardless of the perfect copy still running. I hope I clarified my point.
Getting a new body because yours can't be saved is why they're offering the contract in the first place though. And I'm pretty sure the offer is free, you didn't pay for removing the biochip or the weeks of treatment either, and they don't mention a price with the contract either. 

You make an agreement that they stop you from dying in exchange for helping them retake control from the traitor son. You did your part and it seems like they're doing theirs. They let you leave no questions asked if you don't sign, makes no sense to only betray you if you sign and be cool with you if you don't.
    [deleted]
        I agree it's left vague af, just seems to me like the whole point of that ending is that you live in exchange for giving up the fight and all. Like in the opposite ending where you attack them, you're fighting the megacorp and become a legend, but you die. It's more narratively and thematically fitting if the ending where you surrender yourself to them actually saves your life, but at the cost of everything else. Ideals vs life.
            [deleted]
also don't forget... what if Arasaka never solves the body rejection issue?  Or if you get new leadership at Arasaka that believes you are too much of a loose end to revive?  Going into Mikoshi is one of the darkest potential endings imo.
The game has a theme of ideals being bigger than just living, and the Arasaka contract is presented like giving up your ideals to live. Even though you can roleplay through dialogue that this isn't what V wants. Jackie talked about wanting to be a Legend, with a drink named after him. I never did. I don't care.
