[[My one criticism about Cyberpunk endings. (All of then. Major Spoilers)]]


They all have to have that "nothing ever works out for thr best in night city flare"

Especially with the DLC endings this becomes far more painfully obvious. Here is some examples.


Let's say you side with So Mi and therefore end up having no choice but to kill Reed. Ok no problem spent the whole game using non-lethal weapons. Buy you're forcing me to use a magic gun that showed up in my hand?
Ok no problem I'm a max cool pistol I can just shoot his gun out of his hand or do a hand leg combo to put him down. Nope not an option.

Ok no problem I'm an elite level netrunner let me just system shock him. Nope not an option.


Let's say you side with Reed. Ok now I'll do the normal secret ending save all my friends and send Johnny into the net. I got 6 months to live. But hey NUSA owes me a favor why not see if they can help with this problem? Probably have better results than if I'd had gone straight to them...

Speaking of which the tower ending. You're telling me with all this technology NUSA can't just keep my partner (Panam) up to date with an occasional voice message? She knew were I was going so that should be good enough for her based on her character to stick around or at least leave a land line to reach her.



My point being is it's obvious when the developers are trying really hard to make endings bitter sweet or just outright bad when you have countless solutions in your hands to improve them considerably.


>Speaking of which the tower ending. You're telling me with all this technology NUSA can't just keep my partner (Panam) up to date with an occasional voice message?

On the one hand, I can acknowledge that it's unfair to ask someone to put their life on hold for two years while you're in a coma. On the other hand I think that every one of the love interests in the game would have probably waited for you. Judy and Panam especially. Both of those women would have raised hell until the FIA took them directly to you and then plopped down until you woke up. Hell, I honestly wouldn't have been surprised if the Aldecaldos set up camp in your room.
    The aldecaldos would have kidnapped you and your PCP and taken them on the road in their little hospital truck.
        I now have the mental image of a comatose V being the camp mascot.
    Panam and Judy wouldn't wait for V, that's something that The Sun ending makes very clear. Panam still prioritizes Aldecaldos (who by the time of The Tower ending left Night City, as it's mentioned by one of the characters), so when she has to choose between waiting for V in NC or leaving NC with her Family, she picks the last option. Judy also desperately wants to escape NC, so she ends up breaking things up with V and leaving on her own. The only ones who wait for V are River and Kerry, which is why in The Tower ending they had to ruin River's life and send Kerry to the orbit to have a reason for them to not meet with V. I think it's fairly consistent with that ending.
        Well not really. In the Tower ending, she sends V a text telling her if he says to stay then she will and leave the family. Whether or not that was bait to get him to respond, I’m unsure.

Secondly, in the Sun ending or (Don’t Fear) the Reaper, there’s dialogue you can choose where you tell Panam to wait for you while you do one last job and she agrees. 

That doesn’t mean she’d wait for you forever, or in OPs case, without any contact, which is fine. I think the real problem is that the Aldecaldos basically shun you away instead of hearing you out. It’s cool if you moved on, I get it. But to tell me to stay away when I had no agency in the matter is unfair. Especially after everything we did for our “family”.
    >think that every one of the love interests in the game would have probably waited for you

I think after a while you have to assume they are dead right? It's NC, everyone dies. For your own sanity I think you would just have to let go.

I personally like the theory, someone else's that Panam is dead. She might forgive you, she might come stalk you and kill you, but I can't see her ghosting you.
        >I think after a while you have to assume they are dead right? It's NC, everyone dies. For your own sanity I think you would just have to let go.

Of course, but I'd also imagine that a real friend wouldn't have given you a cold shoulder after seeing you come back from the dead. Hell there are even two good examples of how a real friend would go about it in this very ending!
            I had not thought about Judy's response from Male V because I have barely played Male V, I was thinking her response was "stay away V because I will definitely fuck up my entire life if you come here because I can't help myself".

Again, I like the Panam is dead theory. When you kill herself she hopes you rot in hell...no way she wouldn't answer your call just to tell you to go fuck yourself. Honestly, she would probably grab the nearest ride, burn all the way through the night to get to you, walk straight up to you, punch you tell you that and then collapse in an emotional heap.
                Yeah, I felt the same way. If she's not dead, something major must have happened during those two years that changed her, and if it was something bad it's not unreasonable to blame V in addition to whatever the trauma was. I know that from V's perspective it might not seem like a big deal, but simply making the choice to trust the NUSA over the Aldecaldos to help is kind of a betrayal to the nomad way of life already even if V didn't know how long they'd be gone, especially after the whole song and dance V did with helping them not fall in with Biotechnica.

A lot of people on these subs just act like Panam's life just froze during those two years and they can't imagine that anything major might have happened. Like she's just being bitchy for no reason simply because V was gone for two years.
                    I remember seeing that Panam texted several times to tell you that they got into some deep shit and they need your help (idk if she does this for male V), i assume that if she did not die during those events they lost a good chunk of the clan, and that's why they left NC. Still, it's very out of character for her to not only ghost you, but to send someone else to deliver a message for her. As soon as your name popped in the holo she wouldve picked up, even if only to tell you to fuck off herself. As prideful as she may be, she would be justified in hearing your voice for the first time in two years of no contact and just let you have it, and she would be aware of this.
        It makes sense too with how reckless she is.  Without V there to kill everyone who poses a threat to her, it was only a matter of time when she does something that gets her killed
    Judy was in such a period of transition that her leaving for another city made sense to me. It was sad (well, bittersweet. She's married now), but her close friend and former partner just killed herself, she was betrayed by another former partner, and you just up'd and disappeared. It's fair to think that V is a bit of a rebound for Judy and even that wasn't the soft landing she was hoping for.

Also she's a computer person who doesn't exist so I can't believe I gave this so much thought and analysis omfg I need to stand up and walk around
        Her and Evelyn were partners? Didn't know that.
            No, they weren't. But she was her best friend
    If anything, this ending just makes them look bad. It's not unrealistic for people to move on and forget after a two whole years, but it also cheapens the bond V builds with those characters - especially considering that they know about V's situation. Dex takes a two year vacation and he's still hot shit, but when V does even their supposed friends forget about them... Yeah, fine friend you people are. 

This detail makes the tower ending even more unintentionally optimistic depending on the player's outlook - since those friends can forget about you so easily even after all the crazy stuff you've been through together, maybe cutting them loose is a good thing? Especially this Panam lady, I did all sorts of things to help her out without seeing an eddie, and she won't even talk to me now? Clearly she was just using me! This might sound ridiculous for some people, but only because they have the meta knowledge about her helping out in one of the base game endings.
        Dex isn't all that hot, except in Jackie's starstruck eyes. I mean if you consider how multiple characters warn you about Dex and/or disrespect him (Victor, Evelyn, maelstrom come to mind), how his exclusive Afterlife meeting spot is a dingy, messy backroom... I think Dex ain't hot shit anymore and this is just that One Last Gig that'll set him up for life. And it would have, had Takemura been disabled immediately.
    Yea Judy and Panam's reactions to that 2 years skip is very out of character.

Both questlines show you how much of a "fuck it we ball for family" people they are that it's unthinkable they turned out that way. Unless some fuckwad took our ID and told them all to fuck off or something idk.
    Why would the FIA treat them as anything more than a nuisance that needs to be dealt with. If they continued harassing them and trying to come into contact with someone who has an insane amount of dirt on them, demanding they be released or allow them to speak to you, what do you think they’re gonna do? 

I’m not trying to be mean and I hope I’m not coming off that way, but why would the FIA give a fuck about or feel any kind of obligation to V?
        Why would you think you're coming across as mean? You brought up a very valid point. It's best to keep V isolated from their friends and the FIA has the means to make people way more dangerous than a Mox braind dance savant and a nomad disappear. It's just fun to imagine those two raising hell in a hospital until someone just gives up.

As far as why the FIA might care or feel any obligation, I would hope that I might still have a little sway after saving the president, killing Hansen and bringing So Mi back. I know that getting cured was supposed to be my payment, but I would hope that I still have some brownie points left over. Long shot, but it doesn't hurt to dream.
            I just get passionate sometimes and forget myself is all lol. 

Imo, V’s influence on Myers is about as far as Myers could throw them, that being not very far. She’ll act cordial and congratulate you for returning her “property,” but she does not feel any obligation towards V. Just a cold hearted, calculating politician looking out for her own self-interest.
                I'm convinced that the reason we can't use cyberware is because Myers personally saw us destroy that Spider Tank thing and doesn't want to deal with anyone who can do that almost single handedly. But hey, Reed offered us an office job, so there's that.
                    I’ve seen that take floating around. Personally, I think the relic genuinely damaged V’s nerve endings beyond repair. I feel like it makes enough sense to genuinely be true.
    Most people in their 20s I’ve know  start getting ants in their pants about a regular long distance relationship after a month. If someone doesn’t talk to them for a year they might as well be dead. Add on top of that your only contact being a super shady secret agent who is just like “no updates” about your dying lover, if you even get that much.

At a certain point, probably a few months in, you’d just assume they’re going to die, they’re just plain gone, or had died. Look at what you know: they were dying, maybe you know they’re in a coma, and the last you heard from them they’re going to Europe with a bunch of secret agents. No one stays in a coma that long and lives, and so either V is dead or doing spy shit. You move on. 2 years is an eternity when your longest relationship was barely that long, and you’ve only been an adult for 10 years at most.

It probably starts small too. You think “gotta keep busy till V comes back.” Then “V wouldn’t mind if I lived while they recovered.” Then “wow I’m actually happy and haven’t worried about V for like two whole weeks” and then “V is gone, I need to live.”

A year after you go through all that V calls you. You see their id on the holo and take a deep breath thinking you’re finally going to get the news that they kicked it. Then you find out they didn’t. You feel betrayed, even though it doesn’t make sense. You’re happy, how dare they come crashing back into your life and make them feel guilty for moving on.
    Especially if Saul found out. There’s no way he would t come check up on V at least once or twice
    V hasn’t known either of them for particularly long, so I’m not sure they’d wait for 2 years for a person they only knew for a month-ish.
        I suppose I really just wish that we could have at least told them what was happening. At least that way it doesn't seem like I just went ghost.
    That's the thing the nusa doesn't actually give a fuck about you hence why they didn't bother updating anyone 

That's the meaning you got what you wanted the NUSA Got what they wanted and they cut you loose immediately
    A ragtag band of tarmac rats against what is basically the CIA on steroids? Yeah, good luck with that.
        >Yeah, good luck with that.

Someone go into my Stash and grab Skippy. He'll take care of this real easy.
            #BAD USER!
I think the issue is that in the video game format we as players expect there to be a “win” option. These are games, after all, and games are things you can win, right? If all of the endings to Cyberpunk involve you losing in some capacity, then the player is being cheated.

Except, that’s if we still understand games as merely toys. Something that belongs to YOU and should gratify YOU. Most games are meant to be power fantasies in this way. Part of what we find so entertaining about games is the satisfaction of winning. 

However, we’re reaching the point where games are trying to be more mature and complex. What makes games so powerful as an art form is that they allow the creator and player to have a conversation. Most games try to say “yes” to the player as much as possible. “Yes, you can climb that mountain.” “Yes, you can drive that car.” “Yes, you can kill that hooker.” But, I think what’s also interesting is the way games can create meaning by saying “no.” Saying “yes” constantly means the experience is not embedded with meaning or intention. It’s just a toy for me to play with. 

Where Cyberpunk becomes special is that they’re actively trying to make you understand this world with the line “live a quiet life or go out in a blaze of glory”(Paraphrasing). The world of Cyberpunk is a world in decay. Nothing gets better and everyone is in constant pain because of late stage capitalism. At the end of the day, really, Cyberpunk is a huge critique of unfettered capitalism. It also draws from the noir genre in that it’s trying to make you understand how powerless the average person really is. So, you’re not meant to like any option in the end. That’s the “no” you’re getting from the developer, and it’s an interesting one because *that’s what it means to live in this world*. No, you cannot live happily ever after, because there is no happily ever after in this world.
    This is the closest response I've seen to how I see it.

A lot of criticism of Cyberpunk, whether it's in 2020 or now, came from gamers who get their idea of what a video game is from GTA5 or FNV: if you can imagine it, then you can do it.  

But good stories can rarely be told without limits (in FNV, the endings where the player trolls the story (Caesar's Legion ending) and the one where they ditch the narrative to minimax (Yes Man ending) are objectively the worst endings from a storytelling perspective).

If the player could do anything, that would include never going back to Dex after the heist, never getting killed, and never needing the Relic to bring them back.  Obviously, the story can't allow you to do that because that would invalidate the whole plot - you can have choices, but you can't do literally *anything* if you expect the developers to have a meaningful story.  (Rockstar navigates this by letting the player be a murder hobo in the main map, but forcing them to follow a script for the missions.)

I think where OP gets upset is the expectation of a "golden endings" where if you make all the "right" choices, everyone lives happily ever after.  The fact that it's a game can make a player feel like they've failed if they DON'T get the golden ending, and I think that's what causes the disconnect in a person who generally understands that stories have to have some constants to be viable narratives.
    I think the substance of OP's post wasn't necessarily that he disliked there being no good ending, but that the game makes a lot of concessions that don't really make any logical sense in order to create those bad endings, like how the many options you as the player have to nonlethally dispatch enemies are forcibly disabled when you fight Reed because he *has* to die at your hands, otherwise the ending isn't sad enough.

I agree with you on pretty much all fronts, but the endings do lose a bit of the impact they're supposed to have when the player can so easily go "but V could have just done this and it would have been fine" and actually be right. Really, it's just ludonarrative dissonance in action because there's no way the devs could have written the story in such a way that accounts for all the options they give the player in gameplay, but I do think the execution for some of them definitely could have been better.
    But it is a game and a role playing game at that. I get what your saying but for me it doesn't work for a game. If there is no "win" ending then why even play? If all endings consist of losing then I've wasted time. Imagine buying an NFL game with a career mode but no matter how good you do your never drafted after college because that's the reality for most people. It's only considered mature because we mistake low grade Nihilism for reality and it's a less complex story because the ending is predetermined as bad regardless of what you do. Yes, its noir but theres a reason noir is not that popular.
        Why watch empire strikes back? The characters dont win so why bother? Why watch logan? Everyone we know dies so why bother? Why play dark souls when the positive endings are about you dying anyways? 

Because its not about winning. 

Its about losing yourself to these worlds and stories. So what if the rebels lose in empire? You see luke grow with the force. You get so much more growth with the usual characters. Then they have so much more to fight for in the next one. 

So what if everyone dies in logan? Its the best goodbye to a character/actor and series we could ask for. You get everyones last hurrah and then its done and you know they made a difference for good or bad. 

So what if you sacrifice yourself at the end of dark souls? Its all about the challenge and exploration. Its about the journey and fight to get to the end. 

Just because your character doesnt get a mansion and live on with 2.5 kids and a partner doesnt mean it was for nothing. 

You got to see the world of cyberpunk through the eyes of someone at the end of their life.. In the time they had remaining they made friendships, had lovers, fought bastards, lost to schemers beyond their scope, and in the end how did people feel when they left? 

Thats what mattered. No one won. Everyone lost something. But how did everyone feel about the merc that shared a fraction of their life? Did they ruin their lives? Did they leave as friends who hope it all turns out well? Did the merc win their hearts only to commit suicide and rip it to shreds? Thats the stuff you played for. To see how this one person and their actions affected the lives around them before the end. 


So what if they dont get to live in the end?
            Empire? You mean where only Yoda dies and everybody else regroups at the end to win in the future?  Logan, never saw it. Never said I wanted a mansion either. But a movie is only 90 to 120 minutes of passive entertainment. It's not dozens of hours of playing.  How does it matter if I had friends when the moral is they'll just lose too because no one wins. Nothing you do ultimately matters if everyone loses in the world. Your character might as well die in a blaze of glory in Act 1. Your talking about movies and I'm saying what works for film might not work for a game. When I found out what the endings were I lost a lot of interest in the main story. I stopped seeing V as my avatar.
        >If there is no “win” ending then why even play?

Why even continue to be alive if you’re going to return to the empty black nothingness all the same in 60 years? Why make friends if they will all move on and forget you eventually? Why cook a delicious meal if it’s just going to become stool once it moves through your body? The answer is you do it because the experience is enjoyable. The fact that after spending 100+ hours with this character you feel a great deal of frustration at seeing them not get a happy ending is a testament to how engaging the experience was. The worst thing a work of art can do is make you feel nothing. 

>Imagine buying an NFL game with a career mode but no matter how good you do you’re never drafted after college because that’s the reality for most people.

Unironically, that sounds like an amazing game. Feels a bit like “Papers Please” where the point is to demonstrate the futility of being a moral person under authoritarianism. A game where the fantasy of being a pro athlete is just out of reach until the reality of that industry dashes those dreams would be a great piece of art. In the end, you played college ball for free and leave the university system with no education, no job prospects, and no money. You become a high school gym coach who wonders what could’ve been and that’s the end. I don’t think EVERY game should be like that. Obviously the game where you DO get to be the pro athlete is more fun, but the game where you are shown a harsh reality through game mechanics raises questions and draws attention to inequities that often get overlooked. Both should exist and if either one isn’t your cup of tea, hey, it’s your right not to play.

>it’s only considered mature because we mistake lowgrade nihilism for reality

I’ll give it to you that cyberpunk 2077 is very nihilsitic, as nihilistic ideas are a key element of noir and cyberpunk as a genre. However, I could point to several games with “mature” stories that are very anti-nihilism.

Undertale, for one, has a very good story about the power of hope and empathy that it conveys with very thoughtful mechanics. It also has a “good” ending which you can only achieve by ignoring any power fantasy impulses and just trying to understand the monsters you’re fighting. It’s childish in style but is extremely mature in subject matter. 

It’s not that I think bleakness makes the story of CP2077 intriguing, it’s that I think the story is intriguing AND it is bleak. If it weren’t bleak it wouldn’t be CP2077 and all of the plot elements throughout wouldn’t make any sense if there were an ending where you get cured, bang your fave NPC, and ride off into the sunset with Johnny still by your side. 

>it’s a less complex story because the ending is predetermined as bad regardless of what you do

I think I actually draw issue with interpreting these endings as “bad”. V, as a character, is just a stand-in for you. Their desires, goals, dreams, hopes, etc. are whatever you decide them to be. If your V is a homicidal maniac who just wants to kill as many people as possible before dying, then the ending where you pull off a space heist probably isn’t even a bad ending. 

The reason these endings get called “bad” is that you can’t get everything you want, and in a power fantasy we want EVERYTHING. The game makes it obvious that your choice is between a quiet life or a blaze of glory. If you think sacrificing your cyborg powers and futuristic gang is worth staying alive, then the Tower ending is likely not a “bad” ending by any means. It’s presenting you with a choice between two things you want and I think players looking for a power fantasy aren’t actually interested in having to choose or having to make a difficult choice. What’s interesting about choice is that it reveals something about yourself. If you have to choose between which of your children to save, you start doing the arithmetic of which kid you love more real fuckin fast.

Again, I think power fantasy games can be more fun and should exist (big ‘choice’ moments would not fit in a game like Doom Eternal, where the point is you are the embodiment of rage) but games that actively subvert power fantasies are more interesting to me in a narrative sense. Both should exist. Cyberpunk 2077 just happens to be the latter. 

>there’s a reason noir is not that popular

…are you serious? 

Go look up any “Top 10 films of all time” list and see how many include a noir film or a film with heavy noir influences.

Hell, have yah heard of fuckin *Batman*? His whole schtick is that he’s a noir detective with sci-fi/fantasy elements sprinkled in. 

Bladerunner? Literally just noir with robots. 

“Not that popular” my ass. Noir is plenty popular, you just don’t like it and it’s your right to not like it.
            I live and eat because I have to. It's not that I don't get everything I want, I don't get anything I want.

For what its worth I think noir films are fine. But games are not film. And no noir is not popular. The fact some noir film is on a list proves nothing. If noir was popular they'd be a lot more of them. How many noir films have come out in the last 10 years? 20 years? How many were succesful? Bat Man is psuedo noir. Its super hero fantasy with noir dressing but how many Bat Man films end with him losing and the villain winning.
                >I live and eat because I have to

No you don’t. Try it! You can stop living and eating at ANY time! You’ll die but you CAN do it. You simply choose not to. 

>how many Batman films end with him losing and the villain winning

The Dark Knight

“You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain” IS “live a quiet life or die in a blaze of glory”

Joker is proven wrong but Harvey Dent is corrupted and Batman has to go into hiding. 

The Batman

The corruption of Gotham is made clear by the riddler. All of Gotham’s heroes are gone except for Batman. This whole movie is drenched in noir tropes it’s so obvious.

These are two of the biggest and most successful batman films

And the comics are just FULL of “Batman wins but loses the spiritual battle” stories.
    > No, you cannot live happily ever after

Except there are tons of people in night city who seem very happy with their lives that you interact with throughout the game. All of the fixers seem pretty happy, you can even hear Mr. Hands talking on the phone with his spouse and being sweet. Considering all the feats that V canonically pulls off, shouldn't they be capable of achieving something like that?

Honestly I think CDPR basically functioned with the idea that depressing ending = good writing. After drafting up 4 different flavors of depression, they realized if they added a genuinely bitter**sweet** ending (I think all the endings are really just bitter with barely any sweet) then everyone would pick that.

My main problem is the entire point and goal of the game is to remove the chip and live the rest of your life. The only ending where that actually happens is the >!PL ending, where literally everyone close to you just stops caring about you and you can't use cyberware!<. It isn't like Johnny's death, who hated Arasaka and died dropping a nuke in their building. He died but at least accomplished something while doing it (even if Arasaka as a company survived). You need to get the chip out and don't ever really accomplish that in a satisfying way. Imagine if in Skyrim there are multiple endings and every one of them has you lose to Alduin and resign yourself to the fact that the world will be destroyed in 6 months.
Regarding the Tower ending, Reed makes it clear in his message that he wants for V to keep it hush hush, mostly because the technology that they are using to cure V was part of one of the secret military projects involving breaching the Blackwall and the entire expansion was about them trying to keep this secret from leaking out. From that point of view, it makes sense they don't inform any people close to V about it, while V themselves are obligated to not share too many details (and to be fair, they didn't expect that it will last that long). And it's not like V tells them everything right before storming Mikoshi either (outside of Panam, for obvious reasons).    

The scene with Reed would lose entire impact if you could just zap him or knock him down unconscious just like that. It's designed specifically to make it into an impactful choice rather then player having a cake and eating it.
I mean I don’t mind most stuff with the endings except the shoot Reed thing if I’m playing a way that gives other options. Realistically speaking, that situation at least should have allowed multiple ways of taking him out instead of plopping a pistol in your inventory.

I can live with just about everything, but idk that felt like the most annoying thing to do. If I want to kill Reed, let me do it with my favorite gun at least. Even then, it kinda takes away from the immersion of my V usually always just pops Quickhacks or uses throwing Knives or a Sandy or something idk. Thats just a moment of gameplay I think should have afforded more than one solution to how you kill or incapacitate him. 

Looking at this comment, I realize this is maybe too excessive, but idk I just wanted to ramble out my thoughts on that.
i'd argue they're deliberately left open ended, with at the very least one, maybe two of the endings being openly hopeful. The 2077 community just likes to spew this "no happy endings in cyberpunk" rhetoric despite it not being quite the truth. Plenty of happy endings in the genre, they're just more "light at the end of the tunnel" rather than "sunshine and rainbows". They're often bittersweet endings too rather than openly sweet.

I will say that there does seem to be a theme of no happy endings in night city specifically, and imo its no coincidence that the two most hopeful endings, sun and star, see V escaping NC for either the badlands or for the heist of a lifetime. Theres plenty of thematic messages in this game that do emphasise how bleak and hopeless the setting is, but theres plenty of hopeful and positive messages too. Johnny's last words to the player in the 3 major base game endings are "never stop fighting" for a reason. 

I will agree that the PL ending is kinda doodoo though, more from a writing standpoint than anything else though. I actually agree with the "victory but at what cost" message, i just think it was implemented poorly. It took away a lot of player agency to make it work, forced a very specific version of V as a character despite roleplay decisions, and forced two different tones, bitter and then hopeful. All the other endings seem like natural progressions of your actions as V, whereas i feel like theres too many moving parts in the new ending to force two different opposing tones like that.
>Speaking of which the tower ending. You're telling me with all this technology NUSA can't just keep my partner (Panam) up to date with an occasional voice message?

Why would NUSA care about your partner ? As far as they're concerned, the whole operation and surgery is meant to be done on the hush hush without anyone knowing about it, Reed tells you explicitely to be as vague as possible.

And personally, I find that CDPR did a great job in writing the characters and the love interests with making them having their own life and their own thing to do outside of what the player character does and not be bound by your choices. Did you disappear for 2 years without trace ? They moved on from you with their own life and so should you.
    its pretty easy to say that your having an operation without talking about all the tech involved
The new ending sucks in my view. There is literally no reason to play or do anything for Judy, Panam, Kerry or River… or even Johnny or anything for that matter once PL opens up to you. Because basically that ending has all of them shit on you and ruin every relationship in the game. So there is zero reason to care about any of them. I understand bittersweet endings. I understand that you can’t always have a happy ending. Honestly, I think it would have been nice to have at least one “good/happy” ending out of all of them. But while I don’t agree with not having at least one available, at least the base game ones treated your time with respect and made sense. The new one basically shits on the player and says everything you did was for nothing, outside of PL. Just my viewpoint, but while I loved the expansion, the new base ending is terrible.
"Shoot the gun out of Reed's hands"? "Hand leg combo"? I'm sorry but that'd be an incredibly lame and corny outcome, especially because Reed wouldn't stop coming after you. That's the whole point. He has devoted his life and soul to the FIA, killing him is the only option to secure So Mi's future, which is why the game forces you to whip out a pistol (also for dramatic effect instead of having a boss fight or something).

>let me just system shock him

Pretty sure hacks like that take time to upload. Soon as Reed sees you hacking, he's shooting.

>But hey NUSA owes me a favor why not see if they can help with this problem?

Well if you sent Johnny into the net and all of that, then it's too late for the NUSA to use the neural matrix. Also, the only way you could possibly get this ending is if you turned down their offer to use the cure on you, and I think they even financially compensate you. So what, you go crawling back to them and expect the NUSA to feel like they owe you, AND for them to not have used the neural matrix for some other purpose already? This seems more like you're the one trying to force a desired ending, which can also be said for the rest of your post.

>NUSA can't just keep my partner (Panam) up to date with an occasional voice message?

So you want/expect the NUSA to rifle through your things and personal life to figure out who is close to you and who needs to be sent voice messages? Not only would that be concerning, but it's pretty naive to think the NUSA cares about you that much. They fulfilled their end of the bargain in curing you (and have also defanged you essentially). They have no reason to do anything else.

>She knew were I was going so that should be good enough for her based on her character to stick around

We have no idea what happened to Panam, she could be dead for all we know. But it's pretty reasonable for her to think you died or that you abandoned her when you said you would be gone for a few weeks tops. Also, unpopular opinion: it's not terribly out of character that Panam doesn't pick up the call. She probably was angry with you for "ditching her" in her eyes, but she has had 2 years to develop as a person and move on. She probably just wants to keep you in the past. The fact that Mitch knows you called probably means she ranted to Mitch about it anyways, so clearly she had some things to say.
while the point of the genre is that things don’t work out in NC/this world in the long term at least, forcing that into every *possible* outcome seems a little forced. this is still supposed to be a *world*, albeit a grim one, and sometimes people do succeed (the corps wouldn’t be doing so well otherwise!)

so while i’m against any unambiguously Good Ending for V, i do also think it’s possible for someone as dangerously powerful as them, with the right support, to get an outcome that legitimately saves them in the way they wanted. it would just have to come at a cost to the world, making the status quo a little more grim etc
    >while the point of the genre is that things don’t work out in NC/this world in the long term at least, forcing that into every possible outcome seems a little forced.

Many people say that "it's cyberpunk, it's NC, it's the only way it's supposed to be! GRIMDAAARK", but the tone is irrelevant if the story doesn't make sense. Which is the problem with PL.
        i think PL’s story makes sense, but the tower ending doesn’t quite as much. if you went tower all the way, you’ve proven yourself to be a useful NUSA asset, so it doesn’t make much logistical sense sense to (as i believe happened) separately nuke your cyberware capacity and keep you frail afterwards.

it *does* make sense to do that if you betrayed So Mi at the very end, because you’ve already proven that you’re somewhat opposed to the NUS in some sense, and you’ve also proven that you’ll betray people the moment you catch onto their shit (whether or not you the player think it’s justified)

tl;dr the story’s fine but it’s weird that they nuke your cyberware capacity after the treatment if you’ve proven yourself loyal, and it feels like CDPR felt obligated to make the ending suck by at least some metrics Because It’s Grimdark
            >  so it doesn’t make much logistical sense sense to (as i believe happened) separately nuke your cyberware capacity and keep you frail afterwards.

Why not? If the NUSA views V as a potential threat, then nuking their cyberware capacity and keeping them frail makes plenty of sense. Further, if whatever they did is reversable, then it makes even more sense. If they view V as an asset, then it's as simpl as, "Hey V, we found a way to fix you, but only if you have to promise to do 'X' for us first."

>the story’s fine but it’s weird that they nuke your cyberware capacity after the treatment if you’ve proven yourself loyal, 

It's a major component of the PL storyline that all of these people are extremely paranoid. It doesn't matter how loyal you are (or appear to be), at the highest levels of NUSA politics, nobody trusts anybody and everyone expects to be backstabbed at any time. 

Just look at Reed. He's as loyal to the NUSA as it gets, but that still didn't stop Meyers from screwing him over when it benefited her. Why wouldn't the same be true of V?
            >i think PL’s story makes sense, but the tower ending doesn’t quite as much.

Yes, I should've written "the problem with PL's ending". I have a lot of issues with PL's overall narrative, but I wouldn't say it doesn't make sense - outside of the ending, that is.
            That's only an issue if you buy into the "NUSA nuked you on purpose" theory, which imo doesn't really have legs / clear setup - whereas the relic damage being basically impossible to fix is hammered home every time any professional takes a look at it.
                Arasaka can fix it no problem.

Even Alt can fix although it comes with a short life span but game does suggest you could be healed further.

Which is another weird loop hole why not use the alt fixes you ending than go to NUSA with the rogue AI to hammer out the details?


It doesn't add up.

Also that theory has a lot going for it. With the addition of this damage you take? Does show up in any of the normal endings so it kind if has to be something the NUSA has done
                    None of them can fix it properly, I'm not quite sure where you're getting that. 

- Arasaka: probably the worst "fix", they manage to take out Johnny but your brain is still irreparably damaged by the relic & your body doesn't work properly anymore (Rubic's cube, weird visions) you can go engram or live out the remainder of your days. 

- Alt: can separate you and Johnny with no side effects but can't fix the relic brain damage; if V wants to keep the body that brain damage will kill them because the brain is already rewired to Johnny

- Nusa: can also remove Johnny and apparently can do *something* that neither Arasaka or Alt can, namely rewire the brain - you live but get long-term nerve damage from that. 

NUSA imo does clearly better than the other 2, Alt lacks the ability to physically edit the body, Arasaka lacks an AI for whatever magic that does but it's hinted constantly throughout the game that your brain is essentially fucked and that the brain is the last frontier medicine doesn't have control over (yet). Also a big part of the theory usually seems to rest on a "V is so strong Nusa wants to keep them down" but as far as the main quest is concerned V really ain't all that - they're a good Merc but every main quest interaction with others in the game (Rogue, Reed..) have an assessment ranging from "V's solid mid level, V is good" but no-one in the main quest is running around thinking V is some once in a lifetime mega legend.

The whole "use Nusa after the aldecaldos ending" isn't really a loophole as much as imo just another avenue that the open-endedness of it *could* lead to (same as to Mr blue eyes, or Arasaka or Militech, Biontech whatever). 

Meta reason imo: Narratively all the endings are supposed to be different, so there's no "here's the same ending but we plug X on top" in any of them - same for why you don't get a 5 min fix from Nusa and then an Aldecaldos ride into the sunset. Personally I like that but to each their own.
So your criticism is that it is too faithful to the source material.
    I think the criticism is rather that despite what role the player plays there is no positive ending. Many players don't want exclusively good endings, they rather want the chance to achieve a good outcome in a roleplaying game. For some, the "wrong city, wrong people" trope works; but many players want to prove that the house doesn't always win.
        > there is no positive ending. 

I disagree. The Sun and the Star endings are both clearly positive endings.

> but many players want to prove that the house doesn't always win.

Which, again, is a criticism that the game is too faithful to the source material
        > many players want to prove that the house doesn't always win

But it does.
    Except the narrative put forward in V’s arc put them leaps and bounds beyond what any adventure or sourcebook character was capable of in terms of ambition and ability. It was hopeful, essentially a power fantasy in-game and narratively implemented people into V’s life to show them that life was worth living for. It’s more like, “oh yeah, this is sweet right? Sike! You forgot this was a Cyberpunk media. Let’s toss aside the progress that has superseded what any Edgerunner/Solo has done since the universe’s inception. Oops! you’re dead and/or you lose nearly everyone you cared about. The end.”

Source material never really covered a merc that was single-handedly shifting political scales and diminishing gangs by force in Night City.
        >Source material never really covered a merc that was single-handedly shifting political scales and diminishing gangs by force in Night City.

... Morgan Blackhand
            Three time gaps. Morgan was a shadow agent and operated as such, mainly under Militech. V was arguably out there fucking up the lives of megacorps and the NUSA  in broad daylight. I did account Blackhand when I posted this though so I do agree with you, hence why I said “never REALLY covered”. I can argue what V accomplished within a year makes Blackhand’s career on record almost grunt-like in comparison, but that’s just opinion. The stars (and plot armor) just aligned for V for better and for worse. For the better case, I hope CDPR and Pondsmith are making headway on releasing another sourcebook for more insight on things, including a general overview on the NC Legend that is V.
                I mean, Blackhand made his name as a solo first, but yes, the fact that V does so much so quick is an anomaly in the world.

Though then again, David does a comparable amount in that time, only thing V did better than him was beat smasher (unless you do Tower ending)
                    Very true which is a grim contrast considering David was basically manipulated down that path.  The wear and tear was the only thing that kept him from doing anything critically damaging to Arasaka.

You’re right though, I don’t think I’m giving Blackhand enough credit here but it’s just due to my views of the inconsistent recall of events between the game and the sourcebooks (Firestorm Shockwave is one of my favorites being about the 2023 Raid) that are supposed to represent Blackhand’s legend.

Mainly just wanted to prove my point on how CDPR handled V’s arc delicately to give hope beyond any Cyberpunk genre story I’ve read in my lifetime, just to sweep it out under the rug from us because “the machine wins lol”. V was clearly a cut above the rest and from a lore standpoint, had the resources and acquired sources of intel to save their own lives without even chasing after Mikoshi (Nomads and StormTech relationship is a deep, forgotten plot point until after the fact).

But in all respect we have to factor that Johnny was slowly taking the wheel and V’s personality resisting only posed more threat of harm. He wanted Mikoshi and it was partly because of his personality construct and that he genuinely believed it would save V. I theorized that relic malfunctions are an uncontrolled invasive maneuver by the Relic to combat the personality conflicts between V and Johnny at critical junctions (the main questline) so quite literally, all paths lead to Mikoshi unfortunately.
    Yes, and is a valid criticism, because the devs are getting out their way to make the end or part of that miserable
        >because the devs are getting out their way to make the end or part of that miserable

I disagree. If you betray Songbird in order to help out a clearly evil organization like the NUSA/Meyers, then a miserable ending is a completely logical and expected outcome.
            "logical outcome" is a long scratch, it's appear that you is take on caunt the instant karma form the situation
                >it's appear that you is take on caunt the instant karma form the situation

First, this sentence doesn't make sense. I don't understand what you're trying to say. 

Second, how is it in any way a "long scratch?" Throughout the main storyline of PL, the player is shown REPEATEDLY that 1) the NUSA/Meyers are evil, and 2) the NUSA/Meyers is willing you fuck over even their most loyal minions (Reed and Alex) when the NUSA/Meyers no longer has a use for them. It's perfectly logical and expected that the NUSA/Meyers would do the same to V.
                    Reading that sentence had me laughing out loud
        Yeah that’s kind of the point of the whole genre
I'm gonna start this with: V is a merc in Night City, and Night City is not something to aspire to, I think as said by Mike Pondsmith. 

It's really what you take out of the endings.  They all have tradeoffs. It's up to the player to make the choice that fits them most. I have endings I'm perfectly satisfied with that make me happy, even if they're not obviously the best choice or whatever - they work for me because I see hope in them and that's a net positive.

I've done the Tower ending...once, I think - out of like 5 playthroughs of PL lol (*but i cleansed myself by reloading firestarter and going for killing moon - just wanted to experience it). It is a rough ending for me and one I'm obviously not keen to do again 😂. But - it completely works for some because they got what they wanted; a new life, and a new start for V. I didn't once think it didn't make sense though, for what I had to do to get that ending I was like "well, I deserve this" lol, because you don't get that ending without cost, you get that ending by exchanging someone's autonomy and life so you can get yours back in some form.
I pretty much like everything in this game, everything but endings. I think most of them are drama for the sake of drama. They're trying to convey a particular thought about living on your knees vs dying free, but somewhat overdo it so it doesn't look poetic, more like forced.

 I fix some endings with headcanons, but some are beyond fixing (like the suicide ending with Vik giving you a gun then being upset you used it lol)
I mean the setting is a dystopia.. happy endings *should* be pretty damned rare.
    But if the options are presented and obvious but you just can't take them. That's were I have a problem with it.

Or if it kind of breaks a character in order to achieve it. Like there is no reason Reed couldn't be convinced to
Let her go. He clearly has a big problem with Myers at thay point and he clearly knows she's 100% in the wrong as it was her actions that created this entire scenario and now she's "tieing up lose ends"
        He has a big problem with myers and knows she’s in the wrong, and yet he still submits to her when she orders him to and is willing to kill V to return So Mi to her abuser. It’s his most defining characteristic, loyal to a fault. If Reed wanted to let So Mi go, he wouldn’t have been in that shuttle.
        He has a big problem with Myers, but at the end of the day he falls totally in line with everything she says and is committed to recovering Songbird - whether for his own reasons or for hers - so no, I don't feel like it was out of character that he couldn't be convinced to let her go.
The only thing I will say about NUSA is i think you are overestimating the debt they are willing to pay to a person. They don't care about you. You were a tool, and if you coincidentally can be helped in the process, they will. But to thing the government will remember they owe you a favor is putting a lot of faith in the faithless. Can they contact panam? Sure. Takes 5 minutes. But they don't have to, so they won't. 
I agree that it is kinda over the top to prevent you from sparing reed. Magical revolver and all. I think it would have been cool if you tried to hack him and the blackwall got him, leaving you in a position of not knowing if your hacks will just terminate someone anymore. Could even be carried through the rest of the game with a small percentage of the blackwall hack being used each time you quickhack. Or if you knocked him out, mr. Blue eyes made the body disappear before you walked back out the rocket, maybe leaving a shared that just stated "We will take care of him. " which would be another "did i do wrong by not killing him" with not knowing what actually happened to reed.
I will argue though, that if you solo the tower, the ending is not bittersweet. If V can take on Arasaka on their home turf while they are gearing up to go to war, the space station doesn't stand a chance at stopping them when they are cut off from any support or reinforcement. And since MBS set up song to be saved, I have little doubt he can do the same for V. The only bittersweet is if you romance Judy, but still, V knew from the jump Judy wanted out of night city. And she's still looking forward to those post cards.
    > They don't care about you. 

This. And it should be EXTREMELY obvious to the player after seeing what the NUSA does to Reed and Alex.
        At least Alex is smart enough to get out if/when she gets the chance.
        Doesn't Alex say they promise u one thing and then nail ur pp to the wall?
I get where you’re coming from, but to me, this is quintessential to cyberpunk as a genre. No one gets a completely happy ending. I know this goes against all video game logic. In video games, you become incrementally more powerful until you take on all obstacles and save the day. In cyberpunk, sometimes just surviving is a victory in and of itself. Sometimes it’s not even about surviving, it’s about starting true to yourself and what you believe in. I love that none of the ending are the “good” one. Throughout the story we see people with their backs against the wall, forced to compromise to survive, or risk their lives to stay true to their values. I don’t want V to be an exception.
Yeah, shoehorned sad together with the implications the expansion has on he base game's narrative are among the things I hate about PL the most.
A happy ending? For folks like us? Wrong city, wrong people.

> You're telling me with all this technology NUSA can't just keep my partner (Panam) up to date with an occasional voice message?

JFC, when will people stop parroting this gonk take? Even leaving OpSec aside, FIA doesn't *know* about Panam. V never got a chance to tell them or setup *anything* for their absence because they were ambushed with the anesthetic on the AV.
I like it

Everything in the game is temporary

A perfectly happy ending for v implies that the world just bends to v in order to make the player happy

But cyberpunk is a consistently shit world, and the successful will die shitty deaths. The more mediocre normal people have a chance to have happy long lives at the cost of not being legends (and being under the thumb of these larger entities that might accidentally kill them)

V chose to be a legend. That’s the life they choose and the outcomes reflect that

If they were more normal then they’d have the happy life you want for them. We just wouldn’t care to play it

That’s what I think anyway
Correct me if I’m wrong, but “there are no happy endings in Night City” is a driving plot point in the entire game.  Everyone that gets a “good” ending, leaves, even down to the gigs I can think of off the top of my head.
>Let's say you side with So Mi and therefore end up having no choice but to kill Reed.

There was an option to not kill Reed before they changed the plot of the expansion. You could basically convince him to let you and So Mi go because So Mi saved his life after that train ambush in 2070. Song also had a cure for V, you'd get it and she'd go to the moon. As you can see none of this made it to the current version of Phantom Liberty.
Perhaps they forced us to kill Reed for the dramatic effect.

>Speaking of which the tower ending.

For some it might not be that bad. But once you look below the surface then you'll see that it's a pretty grim conclusion. The tower card says a lot about this ending. Connect that with giving Myers' a mindless WMD and you've got yourself a disaster, ready to happen at any moment.

>You're telling me with all this technology NUSA can't just keep my partner (Panam)

It's speculated that Panam might be dead. But I think CDPR wrote the ending like this on purpose so it's more of a gut punch. Most players wouldn't mind losing all their chrome, if everything else was fine. So they had to add something in order to make the ending feel sadder.

That was the one I had the issue with. I understand it's dystopian, and that having a sunshine and rainbows ending isn't necessarily in the spirit of the world. It just felt so shoehorned in like the devs were balancing a gameplay mechanic because it felt too OP without any real reason to within the narrative. We don't want a "good" ending most people will pick isn't really a compelling reason to me. You come back with no powers, literally a shell of your former self, Johnny's gone, you still lost 2 years. This wasn't some perfect ending.

All the other downsides in the main game endings felt fair enough to me within the context of the story, but the PL one? Not so much.
    Yeah this is my problem it feels unnatural like it's forced. The characters are not lining up with their own archs. You have obvious options you can't take as well just doesn't feel good
The issue I think is people are looking for a good ending that leaves you in NC. There isn’t one. There is never a good ending in Nc. The only good end, the only happy way out is to leave and trust your friends and loved ones to help you get care elsewhere. 
Night City is not meant for happy endings.
There are lots of times the plot is a bit "rigged" to very poor outcomes but it is, there's no point getting mad over it.
    Why do I have to be mad about? I'm just saying it's not a good way to go about it when it feels so forced.
        I'm not saying you have to be mad about it.

It's just I tend to get a bit salty when the game forces you on a bad path when there are clearly better ways to handle certain situations and when these things happens it's better not to think too hard on it and just enjoy what is there.
This is the tone of the story lol. V is a tragic hero doomed to die and trying to accomplish as much as possible before he does. Every single quest line looking into solutions for the chip comes up empty. Having a happy survival ending would destroy the impact of the game. You either die a night city legend or take the new ending and become a nobody in a world you barely recognize.
It appears your criticism has to do with one of the primary mainstays of the genre: there no unequivocal good ending, there's always a caveat or cost.
This will forever be one of my favorite games but this is, by far, the biggest fault of the story and gets worse with Phantom Liberty. It feels like the game has to bend so far in order to make every ending bittersweet. My personal head-canon is that Panam’s friend in Arizona DOES cure V. I have no evidence and it’s purely philosophical simply because the world established that there’s no happy endings in Night City. V leaving Night City and letting go of the same dream that killed Jackie, T-Bug and even David means that he’s found a new dream and something else to live for.
    > My personal head-canon is that Panam’s friend in Arizona DOES cure V.

Riiight. Surely Panam has some friend sitting somewhere in the desert who can do what neither Arasaka nor FIA / NUSA could.
        Well the friends she mentioned are implied to be StormTech, a nomad owned company specialised in bioengineering and cybernetics so yeah that's the ending implication,
            If you believe Stormtech knows more about bioengineering and cybernetics than Arasaka, I've got a bridge to sell you.
There are no happy endings in Night City. That's the entire point. V is not the main character, Blackhand is not the main character, Smasher, Yorinobu, David, Saburo, none are the main character. Night City is, and the city ALWAYS wins.
    I get that grim dark for the sake of being grim dark.

It's like in Warhammer 40k I read that the way they refuse ship they need to refill the reactor with these highly radioactive rods so they send a guy in hopped up on endless drugs and it's basically a human sacrifice. They do this because AI is banned....

I'm sorry you need AI to move an object from a to b?

We've been doing that with automated but dumb machines for like at least 50 years.



It doesn't make sense. Grim dark is great but if it's not grounded in some amount of realism it's just a joke.
        > Grim dark is great but if it's not grounded in some amount of realism it's just a joke.

Yeah, I totally dig all the realism in that game about chroming up your body, hacking people, and basically stopping time with a machine bolted onto your spine.
            TBF there is a difference between the rules of the world being established, and a logical  narrative solution that gets ignored.

For example its established yet unrealistic that Jedis have psychic powers and shit, but thats the world they live in so its established lore. But it doesn't make sense that the emperor somehow returns. Now you can say its not the most illogical thing in that universe compared to reality, but one is established world building and the other is dumb even considering the narrative.
                Sure, I get that actually being consistent with your world rules is more important than realism in fiction. I wasn't the one throwing around that term ;)
And now we get to what I think of as the role playing vs story cohesiveness paradox. The more open ended a game is, the harder it will be to build a tight, emotional story around it because with the more choice you give the player, the more choices you need to build around. This means more cutscenes, more dialogue, thousands of man hours to do. Compare any Bethesda game to say Mass Effect. Mass Effect has you play a designated character with designated goal and basically only a good/bad morality system to play with, yet people praise its storytelling all the time. Bethesda gives you far more choice, but because of this, the story suffers. You can’t anticipate every single way every player will play. This is why games like Witcher and Cyberpunk have such great stories though. They restrict choices, yes, but the story works better for it. Disco Elysium and Baldur’s Gate 3 are probably the best for giving you a great story while also making all your role playing meaningful, but those are both unicorn games. Most RPGs go either the Bethesda/Obsidian route of unlimited choice or the BioWare/CDPR route of giving you a pre-designed character and letting you roleplay within that character. Both have their merits and drawbacks, but understand the type of role playing you’re looking for has basically never been done before so it’s not really fair to hold that against the developer.
"Guess I meant, I dunno... a happier ending... for everyone involved."



"Here, for folks like us? Wrong city, wrong people."
Don't criticise the endings, especially those of the expansion, this group doesn't like it. /S
Reed asked you if you want to join NUSA at least twice. V said no. Even afterwards V lives without implants but lives normal life what is the issue here? V had 10+ cars at few million eddies. Sounds like good retirement. 

It doesn't make any sense why would anyone pick SoMi ending she's plays you from the start maybe simp generation can't see that.
In Night City the city always wins
Idk what you want man, there are no 100% good endings because there are no 100% good choices. Something is always lost in order to gain something else. 

Also a small note about not having a choice in killing Reed. 1. It makes for a better story 2. If you leave him alive, he’s just going to keep coming after you or So Mi 3. There was no other way for Reed’s story to end, he’s loyal to the NUS to an absurd degree, and if it wasn’t us, it would’ve been someone else, all in the name of the NUS in reed’s mind.
My issue is when games that are all about choices ultimately throw that all away to have nothing but “bad” endings like this and Mass Effect. Like yeah, I love that a lot of these endings are bittersweet. If I want my character to have a bittersweet ending, I’ll go down that path. But I wish you could also have the  choice for a good ending, if that’s what you wanted for your V and that’s how you wanted the narrative to play out.
It’s a genre thing, cyberpunk is a bit of a noir and one of the elements of noir is that the universe is ambivalent and cruel.  That nothing you do really matters and it all ends terribly.  The whole “forget it Jake, it’s Chinatown.”
It's been a while since I've played the expansion but doesn't Reed tell you that you can't elaborate on where you're going for the surgery so you have to be vague? I don't really think the NUS would contact other people if this was the case?
thing is...game is unrealistic for allowing V to do things right in the first place

in reality, V would probably need to take out countless civilians to have his way in the end.
Cyberpunk as a sub-genre doesn’t tell happy stories, it doesn’t tell stories where you win. Most of the time, characters end up dead, or at least stuck right back in the system they fight so hard to get out of.

*Cyberpunk2077* exemplifies this, so goddamn well. There’s no “good ending.” Yeah, I guess leaving the city with Panam is a good ending, but you’ll still probably end up dead. There’s no ending where V really permanently survives as the merc/badass we play as because he just ain’t supposed to.
The thing to me isn't so much about the fact that V is strong but story ignores it, it's more so that even if I were to suspend my disbelief, it would still be insane how things come together on a CONSTANT basis, IN THE WORST WAY imaginable, SOMEHOW.

Like the game's so consistent in how bad things turn out to be, and how often that happens, that its fucking comical. It's like a thing of; if you overuse something it loses its meaning, and they seemed to have forgotten about that? And beyond that its just so predictable to literally know what's going to happen every single time with every single thing related to the main story. that's probably one of my biggest qualms with this game
See there's saying that they all have that element of doom and gloom but that is kinda the whole point of the genre I'm afraid.
I still maintain that the unaliving ending is the best ending.

You're dead already. Johnny's been dead a long time. All your enemies lose. None of your friends have to die. They're not endangered by your actions.

Yes your friends will be Sad. Angry. But they're alive. 

Bad message to send. But one that resonated with me. That said I'm hardly the poster child for good mental health.

The only correct ending is the secret ending
    Agreed
By the end of the game V is stupidly overpowered, she can walk into Arasaka tower and kill everyone in her path including Smasher. But Reed can still one shot you if you get too close.
All the endings combined and seeing that there is no hope in basically any of them, I think te best ending is not to take the hypospray from Goro during the car chase.

Nothing matters in the end so why bother 😉

I just got the "6 months to live" ending in my last playthrough and I really wish you could just continue from there instead of going back to Meet Honako at the Embers.
This is one of those things I love/hate about CDPR.  From the Witcher games to CP2077, the idea is that you're just a regular person in the grand scheme of things.  In the Wticher, you'll never be able to touch the church nor the countries because they're too powerful. You can kill some individuals from those establishments but never actually bring it down.  It's not like JRPGs where you change the whole world and have the power to bring down entire establishments at a whim.  

It grounds the games a lot more but in some ways, I find it very pessimistic and defeatist in relation to big entities.  In reality, there's many instances in history where a small nobody changed the world on a grand scale eg: WW1 being triggered by the assassination of Ferdinand, slow decline of the US from the assassination of Kennedy.  These large entities are **not** untouchable but are often portrayed as such in CDPR games.  I'll grant them that because it'll probably be a nightmare to create a scenario for every little thing but there's hope that some AI tools can be used in the future to make NPCs and corporations behave in ways that allows more freedom (who doesn't wanna just walk into Arasaka or Militech building and wipe everyone out?).
I loved killing myself.  No I'm not gonna let some crackhead terrorist take over my brain, no I don't feel like causing a revolution.  I'm gonna get laid, win a boxing championship, get absolutely nuked on every drug in night city, then chill and blow my brains out.  It's like my real life, except I'm not getting laid or winning championships
It's even worse after you've seen all endings because some endings provide insight into what really happens in the others, what your other choices really entail, even if they are mutually exclusive. The only "good" ending is the one where both V and the other guy learn from the journey, get to keep the memories and... Leave the frak away.
There doesn't have to be a strict good ending. Honestly, it does kinda fuck with the overall messaging of the game, being "If you go in too deep, there's only so many ways to float back up." If V had chosen to never get involved, they could have had a normal, boring life in a horrific dystopia where no one gets a happy ending, but at least he could have fallen in love, lived a full life, and at the very least, not have had to create a mountain of corpses to live only a few months more.

But, they went too deep. Instead of living unremarkably, they gave the illegal scene of night city their best shot, became a legend, and pushed all the friends they made along the way either into an early grave, or into more danger than they could have imagined. All for a few paltry months in a dying body that can't ever recover, or forever stuck with the NUSA as a drone, or abandoning their body altogether to become a part of one massive AI collective beyond the blackwall.
Man, it never occurred to me that V (logically) could hit up the NUSA after the don't fear the reaper ending. I can't imagine any reason it wouldn't work. The doctors talk about "the construct," like some junk data they are just cutting out.
The aldecaldos would have kidnapped you and your PCP and taken them on the road in their little hospital truck.
    I now have the mental image of a comatose V being the camp mascot.
Panam and Judy wouldn't wait for V, that's something that The Sun ending makes very clear. Panam still prioritizes Aldecaldos (who by the time of The Tower ending left Night City, as it's mentioned by one of the characters), so when she has to choose between waiting for V in NC or leaving NC with her Family, she picks the last option. Judy also desperately wants to escape NC, so she ends up breaking things up with V and leaving on her own. The only ones who wait for V are River and Kerry, which is why in The Tower ending they had to ruin River's life and send Kerry to the orbit to have a reason for them to not meet with V. I think it's fairly consistent with that ending.
    Well not really. In the Tower ending, she sends V a text telling her if he says to stay then she will and leave the family. Whether or not that was bait to get him to respond, I’m unsure.

Secondly, in the Sun ending or (Don’t Fear) the Reaper, there’s dialogue you can choose where you tell Panam to wait for you while you do one last job and she agrees. 

That doesn’t mean she’d wait for you forever, or in OPs case, without any contact, which is fine. I think the real problem is that the Aldecaldos basically shun you away instead of hearing you out. It’s cool if you moved on, I get it. But to tell me to stay away when I had no agency in the matter is unfair. Especially after everything we did for our “family”.
>think that every one of the love interests in the game would have probably waited for you

I think after a while you have to assume they are dead right? It's NC, everyone dies. For your own sanity I think you would just have to let go.

I personally like the theory, someone else's that Panam is dead. She might forgive you, she might come stalk you and kill you, but I can't see her ghosting you.
    >I think after a while you have to assume they are dead right? It's NC, everyone dies. For your own sanity I think you would just have to let go.

Of course, but I'd also imagine that a real friend wouldn't have given you a cold shoulder after seeing you come back from the dead. Hell there are even two good examples of how a real friend would go about it in this very ending!
        I had not thought about Judy's response from Male V because I have barely played Male V, I was thinking her response was "stay away V because I will definitely fuck up my entire life if you come here because I can't help myself".

Again, I like the Panam is dead theory. When you kill herself she hopes you rot in hell...no way she wouldn't answer your call just to tell you to go fuck yourself. Honestly, she would probably grab the nearest ride, burn all the way through the night to get to you, walk straight up to you, punch you tell you that and then collapse in an emotional heap.
            Yeah, I felt the same way. If she's not dead, something major must have happened during those two years that changed her, and if it was something bad it's not unreasonable to blame V in addition to whatever the trauma was. I know that from V's perspective it might not seem like a big deal, but simply making the choice to trust the NUSA over the Aldecaldos to help is kind of a betrayal to the nomad way of life already even if V didn't know how long they'd be gone, especially after the whole song and dance V did with helping them not fall in with Biotechnica.

A lot of people on these subs just act like Panam's life just froze during those two years and they can't imagine that anything major might have happened. Like she's just being bitchy for no reason simply because V was gone for two years.
                I remember seeing that Panam texted several times to tell you that they got into some deep shit and they need your help (idk if she does this for male V), i assume that if she did not die during those events they lost a good chunk of the clan, and that's why they left NC. Still, it's very out of character for her to not only ghost you, but to send someone else to deliver a message for her. As soon as your name popped in the holo she wouldve picked up, even if only to tell you to fuck off herself. As prideful as she may be, she would be justified in hearing your voice for the first time in two years of no contact and just let you have it, and she would be aware of this.
    It makes sense too with how reckless she is.  Without V there to kill everyone who poses a threat to her, it was only a matter of time when she does something that gets her killed
Judy was in such a period of transition that her leaving for another city made sense to me. It was sad (well, bittersweet. She's married now), but her close friend and former partner just killed herself, she was betrayed by another former partner, and you just up'd and disappeared. It's fair to think that V is a bit of a rebound for Judy and even that wasn't the soft landing she was hoping for.

Also she's a computer person who doesn't exist so I can't believe I gave this so much thought and analysis omfg I need to stand up and walk around
    Her and Evelyn were partners? Didn't know that.
        No, they weren't. But she was her best friend
If anything, this ending just makes them look bad. It's not unrealistic for people to move on and forget after a two whole years, but it also cheapens the bond V builds with those characters - especially considering that they know about V's situation. Dex takes a two year vacation and he's still hot shit, but when V does even their supposed friends forget about them... Yeah, fine friend you people are. 

This detail makes the tower ending even more unintentionally optimistic depending on the player's outlook - since those friends can forget about you so easily even after all the crazy stuff you've been through together, maybe cutting them loose is a good thing? Especially this Panam lady, I did all sorts of things to help her out without seeing an eddie, and she won't even talk to me now? Clearly she was just using me! This might sound ridiculous for some people, but only because they have the meta knowledge about her helping out in one of the base game endings.
    Dex isn't all that hot, except in Jackie's starstruck eyes. I mean if you consider how multiple characters warn you about Dex and/or disrespect him (Victor, Evelyn, maelstrom come to mind), how his exclusive Afterlife meeting spot is a dingy, messy backroom... I think Dex ain't hot shit anymore and this is just that One Last Gig that'll set him up for life. And it would have, had Takemura been disabled immediately.
Yea Judy and Panam's reactions to that 2 years skip is very out of character.

Both questlines show you how much of a "fuck it we ball for family" people they are that it's unthinkable they turned out that way. Unless some fuckwad took our ID and told them all to fuck off or something idk.
Why would the FIA treat them as anything more than a nuisance that needs to be dealt with. If they continued harassing them and trying to come into contact with someone who has an insane amount of dirt on them, demanding they be released or allow them to speak to you, what do you think they’re gonna do? 

I’m not trying to be mean and I hope I’m not coming off that way, but why would the FIA give a fuck about or feel any kind of obligation to V?
    Why would you think you're coming across as mean? You brought up a very valid point. It's best to keep V isolated from their friends and the FIA has the means to make people way more dangerous than a Mox braind dance savant and a nomad disappear. It's just fun to imagine those two raising hell in a hospital until someone just gives up.

As far as why the FIA might care or feel any obligation, I would hope that I might still have a little sway after saving the president, killing Hansen and bringing So Mi back. I know that getting cured was supposed to be my payment, but I would hope that I still have some brownie points left over. Long shot, but it doesn't hurt to dream.
        I just get passionate sometimes and forget myself is all lol. 

Imo, V’s influence on Myers is about as far as Myers could throw them, that being not very far. She’ll act cordial and congratulate you for returning her “property,” but she does not feel any obligation towards V. Just a cold hearted, calculating politician looking out for her own self-interest.
            I'm convinced that the reason we can't use cyberware is because Myers personally saw us destroy that Spider Tank thing and doesn't want to deal with anyone who can do that almost single handedly. But hey, Reed offered us an office job, so there's that.
                I’ve seen that take floating around. Personally, I think the relic genuinely damaged V’s nerve endings beyond repair. I feel like it makes enough sense to genuinely be true.
Most people in their 20s I’ve know  start getting ants in their pants about a regular long distance relationship after a month. If someone doesn’t talk to them for a year they might as well be dead. Add on top of that your only contact being a super shady secret agent who is just like “no updates” about your dying lover, if you even get that much.

At a certain point, probably a few months in, you’d just assume they’re going to die, they’re just plain gone, or had died. Look at what you know: they were dying, maybe you know they’re in a coma, and the last you heard from them they’re going to Europe with a bunch of secret agents. No one stays in a coma that long and lives, and so either V is dead or doing spy shit. You move on. 2 years is an eternity when your longest relationship was barely that long, and you’ve only been an adult for 10 years at most.

It probably starts small too. You think “gotta keep busy till V comes back.” Then “V wouldn’t mind if I lived while they recovered.” Then “wow I’m actually happy and haven’t worried about V for like two whole weeks” and then “V is gone, I need to live.”

A year after you go through all that V calls you. You see their id on the holo and take a deep breath thinking you’re finally going to get the news that they kicked it. Then you find out they didn’t. You feel betrayed, even though it doesn’t make sense. You’re happy, how dare they come crashing back into your life and make them feel guilty for moving on.
Especially if Saul found out. There’s no way he would t come check up on V at least once or twice
V hasn’t known either of them for particularly long, so I’m not sure they’d wait for 2 years for a person they only knew for a month-ish.
    I suppose I really just wish that we could have at least told them what was happening. At least that way it doesn't seem like I just went ghost.
That's the thing the nusa doesn't actually give a fuck about you hence why they didn't bother updating anyone 

That's the meaning you got what you wanted the NUSA Got what they wanted and they cut you loose immediately
A ragtag band of tarmac rats against what is basically the CIA on steroids? Yeah, good luck with that.

        #BAD USER!
This is the closest response I've seen to how I see it.

A lot of criticism of Cyberpunk, whether it's in 2020 or now, came from gamers who get their idea of what a video game is from GTA5 or FNV: if you can imagine it, then you can do it.  

But good stories can rarely be told without limits (in FNV, the endings where the player trolls the story (Caesar's Legion ending) and the one where they ditch the narrative to minimax (Yes Man ending) are objectively the worst endings from a storytelling perspective).

If the player could do anything, that would include never going back to Dex after the heist, never getting killed, and never needing the Relic to bring them back.  Obviously, the story can't allow you to do that because that would invalidate the whole plot - you can have choices, but you can't do literally *anything* if you expect the developers to have a meaningful story.  (Rockstar navigates this by letting the player be a murder hobo in the main map, but forcing them to follow a script for the missions.)

I think where OP gets upset is the expectation of a "golden endings" where if you make all the "right" choices, everyone lives happily ever after.  The fact that it's a game can make a player feel like they've failed if they DON'T get the golden ending, and I think that's what causes the disconnect in a person who generally understands that stories have to have some constants to be viable narratives.
I think the substance of OP's post wasn't necessarily that he disliked there being no good ending, but that the game makes a lot of concessions that don't really make any logical sense in order to create those bad endings, like how the many options you as the player have to nonlethally dispatch enemies are forcibly disabled when you fight Reed because he *has* to die at your hands, otherwise the ending isn't sad enough.

I agree with you on pretty much all fronts, but the endings do lose a bit of the impact they're supposed to have when the player can so easily go "but V could have just done this and it would have been fine" and actually be right. Really, it's just ludonarrative dissonance in action because there's no way the devs could have written the story in such a way that accounts for all the options they give the player in gameplay, but I do think the execution for some of them definitely could have been better.
But it is a game and a role playing game at that. I get what your saying but for me it doesn't work for a game. If there is no "win" ending then why even play? If all endings consist of losing then I've wasted time. Imagine buying an NFL game with a career mode but no matter how good you do your never drafted after college because that's the reality for most people. It's only considered mature because we mistake low grade Nihilism for reality and it's a less complex story because the ending is predetermined as bad regardless of what you do. Yes, its noir but theres a reason noir is not that popular.
    Why watch empire strikes back? The characters dont win so why bother? Why watch logan? Everyone we know dies so why bother? Why play dark souls when the positive endings are about you dying anyways? 

Because its not about winning. 

Its about losing yourself to these worlds and stories. So what if the rebels lose in empire? You see luke grow with the force. You get so much more growth with the usual characters. Then they have so much more to fight for in the next one. 

So what if everyone dies in logan? Its the best goodbye to a character/actor and series we could ask for. You get everyones last hurrah and then its done and you know they made a difference for good or bad. 

So what if you sacrifice yourself at the end of dark souls? Its all about the challenge and exploration. Its about the journey and fight to get to the end. 

Just because your character doesnt get a mansion and live on with 2.5 kids and a partner doesnt mean it was for nothing. 

You got to see the world of cyberpunk through the eyes of someone at the end of their life.. In the time they had remaining they made friendships, had lovers, fought bastards, lost to schemers beyond their scope, and in the end how did people feel when they left? 

Thats what mattered. No one won. Everyone lost something. But how did everyone feel about the merc that shared a fraction of their life? Did they ruin their lives? Did they leave as friends who hope it all turns out well? Did the merc win their hearts only to commit suicide and rip it to shreds? Thats the stuff you played for. To see how this one person and their actions affected the lives around them before the end. 


So what if they dont get to live in the end?
        Empire? You mean where only Yoda dies and everybody else regroups at the end to win in the future?  Logan, never saw it. Never said I wanted a mansion either. But a movie is only 90 to 120 minutes of passive entertainment. It's not dozens of hours of playing.  How does it matter if I had friends when the moral is they'll just lose too because no one wins. Nothing you do ultimately matters if everyone loses in the world. Your character might as well die in a blaze of glory in Act 1. Your talking about movies and I'm saying what works for film might not work for a game. When I found out what the endings were I lost a lot of interest in the main story. I stopped seeing V as my avatar.
    >If there is no “win” ending then why even play?

Why even continue to be alive if you’re going to return to the empty black nothingness all the same in 60 years? Why make friends if they will all move on and forget you eventually? Why cook a delicious meal if it’s just going to become stool once it moves through your body? The answer is you do it because the experience is enjoyable. The fact that after spending 100+ hours with this character you feel a great deal of frustration at seeing them not get a happy ending is a testament to how engaging the experience was. The worst thing a work of art can do is make you feel nothing. 

>Imagine buying an NFL game with a career mode but no matter how good you do you’re never drafted after college because that’s the reality for most people.

Unironically, that sounds like an amazing game. Feels a bit like “Papers Please” where the point is to demonstrate the futility of being a moral person under authoritarianism. A game where the fantasy of being a pro athlete is just out of reach until the reality of that industry dashes those dreams would be a great piece of art. In the end, you played college ball for free and leave the university system with no education, no job prospects, and no money. You become a high school gym coach who wonders what could’ve been and that’s the end. I don’t think EVERY game should be like that. Obviously the game where you DO get to be the pro athlete is more fun, but the game where you are shown a harsh reality through game mechanics raises questions and draws attention to inequities that often get overlooked. Both should exist and if either one isn’t your cup of tea, hey, it’s your right not to play.

>it’s only considered mature because we mistake lowgrade nihilism for reality

I’ll give it to you that cyberpunk 2077 is very nihilsitic, as nihilistic ideas are a key element of noir and cyberpunk as a genre. However, I could point to several games with “mature” stories that are very anti-nihilism.

Undertale, for one, has a very good story about the power of hope and empathy that it conveys with very thoughtful mechanics. It also has a “good” ending which you can only achieve by ignoring any power fantasy impulses and just trying to understand the monsters you’re fighting. It’s childish in style but is extremely mature in subject matter. 

It’s not that I think bleakness makes the story of CP2077 intriguing, it’s that I think the story is intriguing AND it is bleak. If it weren’t bleak it wouldn’t be CP2077 and all of the plot elements throughout wouldn’t make any sense if there were an ending where you get cured, bang your fave NPC, and ride off into the sunset with Johnny still by your side. 

>it’s a less complex story because the ending is predetermined as bad regardless of what you do

I think I actually draw issue with interpreting these endings as “bad”. V, as a character, is just a stand-in for you. Their desires, goals, dreams, hopes, etc. are whatever you decide them to be. If your V is a homicidal maniac who just wants to kill as many people as possible before dying, then the ending where you pull off a space heist probably isn’t even a bad ending. 

The reason these endings get called “bad” is that you can’t get everything you want, and in a power fantasy we want EVERYTHING. The game makes it obvious that your choice is between a quiet life or a blaze of glory. If you think sacrificing your cyborg powers and futuristic gang is worth staying alive, then the Tower ending is likely not a “bad” ending by any means. It’s presenting you with a choice between two things you want and I think players looking for a power fantasy aren’t actually interested in having to choose or having to make a difficult choice. What’s interesting about choice is that it reveals something about yourself. If you have to choose between which of your children to save, you start doing the arithmetic of which kid you love more real fuckin fast.

Again, I think power fantasy games can be more fun and should exist (big ‘choice’ moments would not fit in a game like Doom Eternal, where the point is you are the embodiment of rage) but games that actively subvert power fantasies are more interesting to me in a narrative sense. Both should exist. Cyberpunk 2077 just happens to be the latter. 

>there’s a reason noir is not that popular

…are you serious? 

Go look up any “Top 10 films of all time” list and see how many include a noir film or a film with heavy noir influences.

Hell, have yah heard of fuckin *Batman*? His whole schtick is that he’s a noir detective with sci-fi/fantasy elements sprinkled in. 

Bladerunner? Literally just noir with robots. 

“Not that popular” my ass. Noir is plenty popular, you just don’t like it and it’s your right to not like it.
        I live and eat because I have to. It's not that I don't get everything I want, I don't get anything I want.

For what its worth I think noir films are fine. But games are not film. And no noir is not popular. The fact some noir film is on a list proves nothing. If noir was popular they'd be a lot more of them. How many noir films have come out in the last 10 years? 20 years? How many were succesful? Bat Man is psuedo noir. Its super hero fantasy with noir dressing but how many Bat Man films end with him losing and the villain winning.
            >I live and eat because I have to

No you don’t. Try it! You can stop living and eating at ANY time! You’ll die but you CAN do it. You simply choose not to. 

>how many Batman films end with him losing and the villain winning

The Dark Knight

“You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain” IS “live a quiet life or die in a blaze of glory”

Joker is proven wrong but Harvey Dent is corrupted and Batman has to go into hiding. 

The Batman

The corruption of Gotham is made clear by the riddler. All of Gotham’s heroes are gone except for Batman. This whole movie is drenched in noir tropes it’s so obvious.

These are two of the biggest and most successful batman films

And the comics are just FULL of “Batman wins but loses the spiritual battle” stories.
> No, you cannot live happily ever after

Except there are tons of people in night city who seem very happy with their lives that you interact with throughout the game. All of the fixers seem pretty happy, you can even hear Mr. Hands talking on the phone with his spouse and being sweet. Considering all the feats that V canonically pulls off, shouldn't they be capable of achieving something like that?

Honestly I think CDPR basically functioned with the idea that depressing ending = good writing. After drafting up 4 different flavors of depression, they realized if they added a genuinely bitter**sweet** ending (I think all the endings are really just bitter with barely any sweet) then everyone would pick that.

My main problem is the entire point and goal of the game is to remove the chip and live the rest of your life. The only ending where that actually happens is the >!PL ending, where literally everyone close to you just stops caring about you and you can't use cyberware!<. It isn't like Johnny's death, who hated Arasaka and died dropping a nuke in their building. He died but at least accomplished something while doing it (even if Arasaka as a company survived). You need to get the chip out and don't ever really accomplish that in a satisfying way. Imagine if in Skyrim there are multiple endings and every one of them has you lose to Alduin and resign yourself to the fact that the world will be destroyed in 6 months.
its pretty easy to say that your having an operation without talking about all the tech involved
>while the point of the genre is that things don’t work out in NC/this world in the long term at least, forcing that into every possible outcome seems a little forced.

Many people say that "it's cyberpunk, it's NC, it's the only way it's supposed to be! GRIMDAAARK", but the tone is irrelevant if the story doesn't make sense. Which is the problem with PL.
    i think PL’s story makes sense, but the tower ending doesn’t quite as much. if you went tower all the way, you’ve proven yourself to be a useful NUSA asset, so it doesn’t make much logistical sense sense to (as i believe happened) separately nuke your cyberware capacity and keep you frail afterwards.

it *does* make sense to do that if you betrayed So Mi at the very end, because you’ve already proven that you’re somewhat opposed to the NUS in some sense, and you’ve also proven that you’ll betray people the moment you catch onto their shit (whether or not you the player think it’s justified)

tl;dr the story’s fine but it’s weird that they nuke your cyberware capacity after the treatment if you’ve proven yourself loyal, and it feels like CDPR felt obligated to make the ending suck by at least some metrics Because It’s Grimdark
        >  so it doesn’t make much logistical sense sense to (as i believe happened) separately nuke your cyberware capacity and keep you frail afterwards.

Why not? If the NUSA views V as a potential threat, then nuking their cyberware capacity and keeping them frail makes plenty of sense. Further, if whatever they did is reversable, then it makes even more sense. If they view V as an asset, then it's as simpl as, "Hey V, we found a way to fix you, but only if you have to promise to do 'X' for us first."

>the story’s fine but it’s weird that they nuke your cyberware capacity after the treatment if you’ve proven yourself loyal, 

It's a major component of the PL storyline that all of these people are extremely paranoid. It doesn't matter how loyal you are (or appear to be), at the highest levels of NUSA politics, nobody trusts anybody and everyone expects to be backstabbed at any time. 

Just look at Reed. He's as loyal to the NUSA as it gets, but that still didn't stop Meyers from screwing him over when it benefited her. Why wouldn't the same be true of V?
        >i think PL’s story makes sense, but the tower ending doesn’t quite as much.

Yes, I should've written "the problem with PL's ending". I have a lot of issues with PL's overall narrative, but I wouldn't say it doesn't make sense - outside of the ending, that is.
        That's only an issue if you buy into the "NUSA nuked you on purpose" theory, which imo doesn't really have legs / clear setup - whereas the relic damage being basically impossible to fix is hammered home every time any professional takes a look at it.
            Arasaka can fix it no problem.

Even Alt can fix although it comes with a short life span but game does suggest you could be healed further.

Which is another weird loop hole why not use the alt fixes you ending than go to NUSA with the rogue AI to hammer out the details?


It doesn't add up.

Also that theory has a lot going for it. With the addition of this damage you take? Does show up in any of the normal endings so it kind if has to be something the NUSA has done
                None of them can fix it properly, I'm not quite sure where you're getting that. 

- Arasaka: probably the worst "fix", they manage to take out Johnny but your brain is still irreparably damaged by the relic & your body doesn't work properly anymore (Rubic's cube, weird visions) you can go engram or live out the remainder of your days. 

- Alt: can separate you and Johnny with no side effects but can't fix the relic brain damage; if V wants to keep the body that brain damage will kill them because the brain is already rewired to Johnny

- Nusa: can also remove Johnny and apparently can do *something* that neither Arasaka or Alt can, namely rewire the brain - you live but get long-term nerve damage from that. 

NUSA imo does clearly better than the other 2, Alt lacks the ability to physically edit the body, Arasaka lacks an AI for whatever magic that does but it's hinted constantly throughout the game that your brain is essentially fucked and that the brain is the last frontier medicine doesn't have control over (yet). Also a big part of the theory usually seems to rest on a "V is so strong Nusa wants to keep them down" but as far as the main quest is concerned V really ain't all that - they're a good Merc but every main quest interaction with others in the game (Rogue, Reed..) have an assessment ranging from "V's solid mid level, V is good" but no-one in the main quest is running around thinking V is some once in a lifetime mega legend.

The whole "use Nusa after the aldecaldos ending" isn't really a loophole as much as imo just another avenue that the open-endedness of it *could* lead to (same as to Mr blue eyes, or Arasaka or Militech, Biontech whatever). 

Meta reason imo: Narratively all the endings are supposed to be different, so there's no "here's the same ending but we plug X on top" in any of them - same for why you don't get a 5 min fix from Nusa and then an Aldecaldos ride into the sunset. Personally I like that but to each their own.
I think the criticism is rather that despite what role the player plays there is no positive ending. Many players don't want exclusively good endings, they rather want the chance to achieve a good outcome in a roleplaying game. For some, the "wrong city, wrong people" trope works; but many players want to prove that the house doesn't always win.
    > there is no positive ending. 

I disagree. The Sun and the Star endings are both clearly positive endings.

> but many players want to prove that the house doesn't always win.

Which, again, is a criticism that the game is too faithful to the source material
    > many players want to prove that the house doesn't always win

But it does.
Except the narrative put forward in V’s arc put them leaps and bounds beyond what any adventure or sourcebook character was capable of in terms of ambition and ability. It was hopeful, essentially a power fantasy in-game and narratively implemented people into V’s life to show them that life was worth living for. It’s more like, “oh yeah, this is sweet right? Sike! You forgot this was a Cyberpunk media. Let’s toss aside the progress that has superseded what any Edgerunner/Solo has done since the universe’s inception. Oops! you’re dead and/or you lose nearly everyone you cared about. The end.”

Source material never really covered a merc that was single-handedly shifting political scales and diminishing gangs by force in Night City.
    >Source material never really covered a merc that was single-handedly shifting political scales and diminishing gangs by force in Night City.

... Morgan Blackhand
        Three time gaps. Morgan was a shadow agent and operated as such, mainly under Militech. V was arguably out there fucking up the lives of megacorps and the NUSA  in broad daylight. I did account Blackhand when I posted this though so I do agree with you, hence why I said “never REALLY covered”. I can argue what V accomplished within a year makes Blackhand’s career on record almost grunt-like in comparison, but that’s just opinion. The stars (and plot armor) just aligned for V for better and for worse. For the better case, I hope CDPR and Pondsmith are making headway on releasing another sourcebook for more insight on things, including a general overview on the NC Legend that is V.
            I mean, Blackhand made his name as a solo first, but yes, the fact that V does so much so quick is an anomaly in the world.

Though then again, David does a comparable amount in that time, only thing V did better than him was beat smasher (unless you do Tower ending)
                Very true which is a grim contrast considering David was basically manipulated down that path.  The wear and tear was the only thing that kept him from doing anything critically damaging to Arasaka.

You’re right though, I don’t think I’m giving Blackhand enough credit here but it’s just due to my views of the inconsistent recall of events between the game and the sourcebooks (Firestorm Shockwave is one of my favorites being about the 2023 Raid) that are supposed to represent Blackhand’s legend.

Mainly just wanted to prove my point on how CDPR handled V’s arc delicately to give hope beyond any Cyberpunk genre story I’ve read in my lifetime, just to sweep it out under the rug from us because “the machine wins lol”. V was clearly a cut above the rest and from a lore standpoint, had the resources and acquired sources of intel to save their own lives without even chasing after Mikoshi (Nomads and StormTech relationship is a deep, forgotten plot point until after the fact).

But in all respect we have to factor that Johnny was slowly taking the wheel and V’s personality resisting only posed more threat of harm. He wanted Mikoshi and it was partly because of his personality construct and that he genuinely believed it would save V. I theorized that relic malfunctions are an uncontrolled invasive maneuver by the Relic to combat the personality conflicts between V and Johnny at critical junctions (the main questline) so quite literally, all paths lead to Mikoshi unfortunately.
Yes, and is a valid criticism, because the devs are getting out their way to make the end or part of that miserable
    >because the devs are getting out their way to make the end or part of that miserable

I disagree. If you betray Songbird in order to help out a clearly evil organization like the NUSA/Meyers, then a miserable ending is a completely logical and expected outcome.
        "logical outcome" is a long scratch, it's appear that you is take on caunt the instant karma form the situation
            >it's appear that you is take on caunt the instant karma form the situation

First, this sentence doesn't make sense. I don't understand what you're trying to say. 

Second, how is it in any way a "long scratch?" Throughout the main storyline of PL, the player is shown REPEATEDLY that 1) the NUSA/Meyers are evil, and 2) the NUSA/Meyers is willing you fuck over even their most loyal minions (Reed and Alex) when the NUSA/Meyers no longer has a use for them. It's perfectly logical and expected that the NUSA/Meyers would do the same to V.
                Reading that sentence had me laughing out loud
    Yeah that’s kind of the point of the whole genre
But if the options are presented and obvious but you just can't take them. That's were I have a problem with it.

Or if it kind of breaks a character in order to achieve it. Like there is no reason Reed couldn't be convinced to
Let her go. He clearly has a big problem with Myers at thay point and he clearly knows she's 100% in the wrong as it was her actions that created this entire scenario and now she's "tieing up lose ends"
    He has a big problem with myers and knows she’s in the wrong, and yet he still submits to her when she orders him to and is willing to kill V to return So Mi to her abuser. It’s his most defining characteristic, loyal to a fault. If Reed wanted to let So Mi go, he wouldn’t have been in that shuttle.
    He has a big problem with Myers, but at the end of the day he falls totally in line with everything she says and is committed to recovering Songbird - whether for his own reasons or for hers - so no, I don't feel like it was out of character that he couldn't be convinced to let her go.
> They don't care about you. 

This. And it should be EXTREMELY obvious to the player after seeing what the NUSA does to Reed and Alex.
    At least Alex is smart enough to get out if/when she gets the chance.
    Doesn't Alex say they promise u one thing and then nail ur pp to the wall?
>It's speculated that Panam might be dead. But I think CDPR wrote the ending like this on purpose so it's more of a gut punch. Most players wouldn't mind losing all their chrome, if everything else was fine. So they had to add something in order to make the ending feel sadder.

That was the one I had the issue with. I understand it's dystopian, and that having a sunshine and rainbows ending isn't necessarily in the spirit of the world. It just felt so shoehorned in like the devs were balancing a gameplay mechanic because it felt too OP without any real reason to within the narrative. We don't want a "good" ending most people will pick isn't really a compelling reason to me. You come back with no powers, literally a shell of your former self, Johnny's gone, you still lost 2 years. This wasn't some perfect ending.

All the other downsides in the main game endings felt fair enough to me within the context of the story, but the PL one? Not so much.
Yeah this is my problem it feels unnatural like it's forced. The characters are not lining up with their own archs. You have obvious options you can't take as well just doesn't feel good
Why do I have to be mad about? I'm just saying it's not a good way to go about it when it feels so forced.
    I'm not saying you have to be mad about it.

It's just I tend to get a bit salty when the game forces you on a bad path when there are clearly better ways to handle certain situations and when these things happens it's better not to think too hard on it and just enjoy what is there.
> My personal head-canon is that Panam’s friend in Arizona DOES cure V.

Riiight. Surely Panam has some friend sitting somewhere in the desert who can do what neither Arasaka nor FIA / NUSA could.
    Well the friends she mentioned are implied to be StormTech, a nomad owned company specialised in bioengineering and cybernetics so yeah that's the ending implication,
        If you believe Stormtech knows more about bioengineering and cybernetics than Arasaka, I've got a bridge to sell you.
I get that grim dark for the sake of being grim dark.

It's like in Warhammer 40k I read that the way they refuse ship they need to refill the reactor with these highly radioactive rods so they send a guy in hopped up on endless drugs and it's basically a human sacrifice. They do this because AI is banned....

I'm sorry you need AI to move an object from a to b?

We've been doing that with automated but dumb machines for like at least 50 years.



It doesn't make sense. Grim dark is great but if it's not grounded in some amount of realism it's just a joke.
    > Grim dark is great but if it's not grounded in some amount of realism it's just a joke.

Yeah, I totally dig all the realism in that game about chroming up your body, hacking people, and basically stopping time with a machine bolted onto your spine.
        TBF there is a difference between the rules of the world being established, and a logical  narrative solution that gets ignored.

For example its established yet unrealistic that Jedis have psychic powers and shit, but thats the world they live in so its established lore. But it doesn't make sense that the emperor somehow returns. Now you can say its not the most illogical thing in that universe compared to reality, but one is established world building and the other is dumb even considering the narrative.
            Sure, I get that actually being consistent with your world rules is more important than realism in fiction. I wasn't the one throwing around that term ;)

*cue Linkin Park*
I now have the mental image of a comatose V being the camp mascot.
Well not really. In the Tower ending, she sends V a text telling her if he says to stay then she will and leave the family. Whether or not that was bait to get him to respond, I’m unsure.

Secondly, in the Sun ending or (Don’t Fear) the Reaper, there’s dialogue you can choose where you tell Panam to wait for you while you do one last job and she agrees. 

That doesn’t mean she’d wait for you forever, or in OPs case, without any contact, which is fine. I think the real problem is that the Aldecaldos basically shun you away instead of hearing you out. It’s cool if you moved on, I get it. But to tell me to stay away when I had no agency in the matter is unfair. Especially after everything we did for our “family”.
>I think after a while you have to assume they are dead right? It's NC, everyone dies. For your own sanity I think you would just have to let go.

Of course, but I'd also imagine that a real friend wouldn't have given you a cold shoulder after seeing you come back from the dead. Hell there are even two good examples of how a real friend would go about it in this very ending!
    I had not thought about Judy's response from Male V because I have barely played Male V, I was thinking her response was "stay away V because I will definitely fuck up my entire life if you come here because I can't help myself".

Again, I like the Panam is dead theory. When you kill herself she hopes you rot in hell...no way she wouldn't answer your call just to tell you to go fuck yourself. Honestly, she would probably grab the nearest ride, burn all the way through the night to get to you, walk straight up to you, punch you tell you that and then collapse in an emotional heap.
        Yeah, I felt the same way. If she's not dead, something major must have happened during those two years that changed her, and if it was something bad it's not unreasonable to blame V in addition to whatever the trauma was. I know that from V's perspective it might not seem like a big deal, but simply making the choice to trust the NUSA over the Aldecaldos to help is kind of a betrayal to the nomad way of life already even if V didn't know how long they'd be gone, especially after the whole song and dance V did with helping them not fall in with Biotechnica.

A lot of people on these subs just act like Panam's life just froze during those two years and they can't imagine that anything major might have happened. Like she's just being bitchy for no reason simply because V was gone for two years.
            I remember seeing that Panam texted several times to tell you that they got into some deep shit and they need your help (idk if she does this for male V), i assume that if she did not die during those events they lost a good chunk of the clan, and that's why they left NC. Still, it's very out of character for her to not only ghost you, but to send someone else to deliver a message for her. As soon as your name popped in the holo she wouldve picked up, even if only to tell you to fuck off herself. As prideful as she may be, she would be justified in hearing your voice for the first time in two years of no contact and just let you have it, and she would be aware of this.
It makes sense too with how reckless she is.  Without V there to kill everyone who poses a threat to her, it was only a matter of time when she does something that gets her killed
Her and Evelyn were partners? Didn't know that.
    No, they weren't. But she was her best friend
Dex isn't all that hot, except in Jackie's starstruck eyes. I mean if you consider how multiple characters warn you about Dex and/or disrespect him (Victor, Evelyn, maelstrom come to mind), how his exclusive Afterlife meeting spot is a dingy, messy backroom... I think Dex ain't hot shit anymore and this is just that One Last Gig that'll set him up for life. And it would have, had Takemura been disabled immediately.
Why would you think you're coming across as mean? You brought up a very valid point. It's best to keep V isolated from their friends and the FIA has the means to make people way more dangerous than a Mox braind dance savant and a nomad disappear. It's just fun to imagine those two raising hell in a hospital until someone just gives up.

As far as why the FIA might care or feel any obligation, I would hope that I might still have a little sway after saving the president, killing Hansen and bringing So Mi back. I know that getting cured was supposed to be my payment, but I would hope that I still have some brownie points left over. Long shot, but it doesn't hurt to dream.
    I just get passionate sometimes and forget myself is all lol. 

Imo, V’s influence on Myers is about as far as Myers could throw them, that being not very far. She’ll act cordial and congratulate you for returning her “property,” but she does not feel any obligation towards V. Just a cold hearted, calculating politician looking out for her own self-interest.
        I'm convinced that the reason we can't use cyberware is because Myers personally saw us destroy that Spider Tank thing and doesn't want to deal with anyone who can do that almost single handedly. But hey, Reed offered us an office job, so there's that.
            I’ve seen that take floating around. Personally, I think the relic genuinely damaged V’s nerve endings beyond repair. I feel like it makes enough sense to genuinely be true.
I suppose I really just wish that we could have at least told them what was happening. At least that way it doesn't seem like I just went ghost.
>Yeah, good luck with that.

Someone go into my Stash and grab Skippy. He'll take care of this real easy.
    #BAD USER!
Why watch empire strikes back? The characters dont win so why bother? Why watch logan? Everyone we know dies so why bother? Why play dark souls when the positive endings are about you dying anyways? 

Because its not about winning. 

Its about losing yourself to these worlds and stories. So what if the rebels lose in empire? You see luke grow with the force. You get so much more growth with the usual characters. Then they have so much more to fight for in the next one. 

So what if everyone dies in logan? Its the best goodbye to a character/actor and series we could ask for. You get everyones last hurrah and then its done and you know they made a difference for good or bad. 

So what if you sacrifice yourself at the end of dark souls? Its all about the challenge and exploration. Its about the journey and fight to get to the end. 

Just because your character doesnt get a mansion and live on with 2.5 kids and a partner doesnt mean it was for nothing. 

You got to see the world of cyberpunk through the eyes of someone at the end of their life.. In the time they had remaining they made friendships, had lovers, fought bastards, lost to schemers beyond their scope, and in the end how did people feel when they left? 

Thats what mattered. No one won. Everyone lost something. But how did everyone feel about the merc that shared a fraction of their life? Did they ruin their lives? Did they leave as friends who hope it all turns out well? Did the merc win their hearts only to commit suicide and rip it to shreds? Thats the stuff you played for. To see how this one person and their actions affected the lives around them before the end. 


So what if they dont get to live in the end?
    Empire? You mean where only Yoda dies and everybody else regroups at the end to win in the future?  Logan, never saw it. Never said I wanted a mansion either. But a movie is only 90 to 120 minutes of passive entertainment. It's not dozens of hours of playing.  How does it matter if I had friends when the moral is they'll just lose too because no one wins. Nothing you do ultimately matters if everyone loses in the world. Your character might as well die in a blaze of glory in Act 1. Your talking about movies and I'm saying what works for film might not work for a game. When I found out what the endings were I lost a lot of interest in the main story. I stopped seeing V as my avatar.
>If there is no “win” ending then why even play?

Why even continue to be alive if you’re going to return to the empty black nothingness all the same in 60 years? Why make friends if they will all move on and forget you eventually? Why cook a delicious meal if it’s just going to become stool once it moves through your body? The answer is you do it because the experience is enjoyable. The fact that after spending 100+ hours with this character you feel a great deal of frustration at seeing them not get a happy ending is a testament to how engaging the experience was. The worst thing a work of art can do is make you feel nothing. 

>Imagine buying an NFL game with a career mode but no matter how good you do you’re never drafted after college because that’s the reality for most people.

Unironically, that sounds like an amazing game. Feels a bit like “Papers Please” where the point is to demonstrate the futility of being a moral person under authoritarianism. A game where the fantasy of being a pro athlete is just out of reach until the reality of that industry dashes those dreams would be a great piece of art. In the end, you played college ball for free and leave the university system with no education, no job prospects, and no money. You become a high school gym coach who wonders what could’ve been and that’s the end. I don’t think EVERY game should be like that. Obviously the game where you DO get to be the pro athlete is more fun, but the game where you are shown a harsh reality through game mechanics raises questions and draws attention to inequities that often get overlooked. Both should exist and if either one isn’t your cup of tea, hey, it’s your right not to play.

>it’s only considered mature because we mistake lowgrade nihilism for reality

I’ll give it to you that cyberpunk 2077 is very nihilsitic, as nihilistic ideas are a key element of noir and cyberpunk as a genre. However, I could point to several games with “mature” stories that are very anti-nihilism.

Undertale, for one, has a very good story about the power of hope and empathy that it conveys with very thoughtful mechanics. It also has a “good” ending which you can only achieve by ignoring any power fantasy impulses and just trying to understand the monsters you’re fighting. It’s childish in style but is extremely mature in subject matter. 

It’s not that I think bleakness makes the story of CP2077 intriguing, it’s that I think the story is intriguing AND it is bleak. If it weren’t bleak it wouldn’t be CP2077 and all of the plot elements throughout wouldn’t make any sense if there were an ending where you get cured, bang your fave NPC, and ride off into the sunset with Johnny still by your side. 

>it’s a less complex story because the ending is predetermined as bad regardless of what you do

I think I actually draw issue with interpreting these endings as “bad”. V, as a character, is just a stand-in for you. Their desires, goals, dreams, hopes, etc. are whatever you decide them to be. If your V is a homicidal maniac who just wants to kill as many people as possible before dying, then the ending where you pull off a space heist probably isn’t even a bad ending. 

The reason these endings get called “bad” is that you can’t get everything you want, and in a power fantasy we want EVERYTHING. The game makes it obvious that your choice is between a quiet life or a blaze of glory. If you think sacrificing your cyborg powers and futuristic gang is worth staying alive, then the Tower ending is likely not a “bad” ending by any means. It’s presenting you with a choice between two things you want and I think players looking for a power fantasy aren’t actually interested in having to choose or having to make a difficult choice. What’s interesting about choice is that it reveals something about yourself. If you have to choose between which of your children to save, you start doing the arithmetic of which kid you love more real fuckin fast.

Again, I think power fantasy games can be more fun and should exist (big ‘choice’ moments would not fit in a game like Doom Eternal, where the point is you are the embodiment of rage) but games that actively subvert power fantasies are more interesting to me in a narrative sense. Both should exist. Cyberpunk 2077 just happens to be the latter. 

>there’s a reason noir is not that popular

…are you serious? 

Go look up any “Top 10 films of all time” list and see how many include a noir film or a film with heavy noir influences.

Hell, have yah heard of fuckin *Batman*? His whole schtick is that he’s a noir detective with sci-fi/fantasy elements sprinkled in. 

Bladerunner? Literally just noir with robots. 

“Not that popular” my ass. Noir is plenty popular, you just don’t like it and it’s your right to not like it.
    I live and eat because I have to. It's not that I don't get everything I want, I don't get anything I want.

For what its worth I think noir films are fine. But games are not film. And no noir is not popular. The fact some noir film is on a list proves nothing. If noir was popular they'd be a lot more of them. How many noir films have come out in the last 10 years? 20 years? How many were succesful? Bat Man is psuedo noir. Its super hero fantasy with noir dressing but how many Bat Man films end with him losing and the villain winning.
        >I live and eat because I have to

No you don’t. Try it! You can stop living and eating at ANY time! You’ll die but you CAN do it. You simply choose not to. 

>how many Batman films end with him losing and the villain winning

The Dark Knight

“You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain” IS “live a quiet life or die in a blaze of glory”

Joker is proven wrong but Harvey Dent is corrupted and Batman has to go into hiding. 

The Batman

The corruption of Gotham is made clear by the riddler. All of Gotham’s heroes are gone except for Batman. This whole movie is drenched in noir tropes it’s so obvious.

These are two of the biggest and most successful batman films

And the comics are just FULL of “Batman wins but loses the spiritual battle” stories.
i think PL’s story makes sense, but the tower ending doesn’t quite as much. if you went tower all the way, you’ve proven yourself to be a useful NUSA asset, so it doesn’t make much logistical sense sense to (as i believe happened) separately nuke your cyberware capacity and keep you frail afterwards.

it *does* make sense to do that if you betrayed So Mi at the very end, because you’ve already proven that you’re somewhat opposed to the NUS in some sense, and you’ve also proven that you’ll betray people the moment you catch onto their shit (whether or not you the player think it’s justified)

tl;dr the story’s fine but it’s weird that they nuke your cyberware capacity after the treatment if you’ve proven yourself loyal, and it feels like CDPR felt obligated to make the ending suck by at least some metrics Because It’s Grimdark
    >  so it doesn’t make much logistical sense sense to (as i believe happened) separately nuke your cyberware capacity and keep you frail afterwards.

Why not? If the NUSA views V as a potential threat, then nuking their cyberware capacity and keeping them frail makes plenty of sense. Further, if whatever they did is reversable, then it makes even more sense. If they view V as an asset, then it's as simpl as, "Hey V, we found a way to fix you, but only if you have to promise to do 'X' for us first."

>the story’s fine but it’s weird that they nuke your cyberware capacity after the treatment if you’ve proven yourself loyal, 

It's a major component of the PL storyline that all of these people are extremely paranoid. It doesn't matter how loyal you are (or appear to be), at the highest levels of NUSA politics, nobody trusts anybody and everyone expects to be backstabbed at any time. 

Just look at Reed. He's as loyal to the NUSA as it gets, but that still didn't stop Meyers from screwing him over when it benefited her. Why wouldn't the same be true of V?
    >i think PL’s story makes sense, but the tower ending doesn’t quite as much.

Yes, I should've written "the problem with PL's ending". I have a lot of issues with PL's overall narrative, but I wouldn't say it doesn't make sense - outside of the ending, that is.
    That's only an issue if you buy into the "NUSA nuked you on purpose" theory, which imo doesn't really have legs / clear setup - whereas the relic damage being basically impossible to fix is hammered home every time any professional takes a look at it.
        Arasaka can fix it no problem.

Even Alt can fix although it comes with a short life span but game does suggest you could be healed further.

Which is another weird loop hole why not use the alt fixes you ending than go to NUSA with the rogue AI to hammer out the details?


It doesn't add up.

Also that theory has a lot going for it. With the addition of this damage you take? Does show up in any of the normal endings so it kind if has to be something the NUSA has done
            None of them can fix it properly, I'm not quite sure where you're getting that. 

- Arasaka: probably the worst "fix", they manage to take out Johnny but your brain is still irreparably damaged by the relic & your body doesn't work properly anymore (Rubic's cube, weird visions) you can go engram or live out the remainder of your days. 

- Alt: can separate you and Johnny with no side effects but can't fix the relic brain damage; if V wants to keep the body that brain damage will kill them because the brain is already rewired to Johnny

- Nusa: can also remove Johnny and apparently can do *something* that neither Arasaka or Alt can, namely rewire the brain - you live but get long-term nerve damage from that. 

NUSA imo does clearly better than the other 2, Alt lacks the ability to physically edit the body, Arasaka lacks an AI for whatever magic that does but it's hinted constantly throughout the game that your brain is essentially fucked and that the brain is the last frontier medicine doesn't have control over (yet). Also a big part of the theory usually seems to rest on a "V is so strong Nusa wants to keep them down" but as far as the main quest is concerned V really ain't all that - they're a good Merc but every main quest interaction with others in the game (Rogue, Reed..) have an assessment ranging from "V's solid mid level, V is good" but no-one in the main quest is running around thinking V is some once in a lifetime mega legend.

The whole "use Nusa after the aldecaldos ending" isn't really a loophole as much as imo just another avenue that the open-endedness of it *could* lead to (same as to Mr blue eyes, or Arasaka or Militech, Biontech whatever). 

Meta reason imo: Narratively all the endings are supposed to be different, so there's no "here's the same ending but we plug X on top" in any of them - same for why you don't get a 5 min fix from Nusa and then an Aldecaldos ride into the sunset. Personally I like that but to each their own.
> there is no positive ending. 

I disagree. The Sun and the Star endings are both clearly positive endings.

> but many players want to prove that the house doesn't always win.

Which, again, is a criticism that the game is too faithful to the source material
> many players want to prove that the house doesn't always win

But it does.
>Source material never really covered a merc that was single-handedly shifting political scales and diminishing gangs by force in Night City.

... Morgan Blackhand
    Three time gaps. Morgan was a shadow agent and operated as such, mainly under Militech. V was arguably out there fucking up the lives of megacorps and the NUSA  in broad daylight. I did account Blackhand when I posted this though so I do agree with you, hence why I said “never REALLY covered”. I can argue what V accomplished within a year makes Blackhand’s career on record almost grunt-like in comparison, but that’s just opinion. The stars (and plot armor) just aligned for V for better and for worse. For the better case, I hope CDPR and Pondsmith are making headway on releasing another sourcebook for more insight on things, including a general overview on the NC Legend that is V.
        I mean, Blackhand made his name as a solo first, but yes, the fact that V does so much so quick is an anomaly in the world.

Though then again, David does a comparable amount in that time, only thing V did better than him was beat smasher (unless you do Tower ending)
            Very true which is a grim contrast considering David was basically manipulated down that path.  The wear and tear was the only thing that kept him from doing anything critically damaging to Arasaka.

You’re right though, I don’t think I’m giving Blackhand enough credit here but it’s just due to my views of the inconsistent recall of events between the game and the sourcebooks (Firestorm Shockwave is one of my favorites being about the 2023 Raid) that are supposed to represent Blackhand’s legend.

Mainly just wanted to prove my point on how CDPR handled V’s arc delicately to give hope beyond any Cyberpunk genre story I’ve read in my lifetime, just to sweep it out under the rug from us because “the machine wins lol”. V was clearly a cut above the rest and from a lore standpoint, had the resources and acquired sources of intel to save their own lives without even chasing after Mikoshi (Nomads and StormTech relationship is a deep, forgotten plot point until after the fact).

But in all respect we have to factor that Johnny was slowly taking the wheel and V’s personality resisting only posed more threat of harm. He wanted Mikoshi and it was partly because of his personality construct and that he genuinely believed it would save V. I theorized that relic malfunctions are an uncontrolled invasive maneuver by the Relic to combat the personality conflicts between V and Johnny at critical junctions (the main questline) so quite literally, all paths lead to Mikoshi unfortunately.
>because the devs are getting out their way to make the end or part of that miserable

I disagree. If you betray Songbird in order to help out a clearly evil organization like the NUSA/Meyers, then a miserable ending is a completely logical and expected outcome.
    "logical outcome" is a long scratch, it's appear that you is take on caunt the instant karma form the situation
        >it's appear that you is take on caunt the instant karma form the situation

First, this sentence doesn't make sense. I don't understand what you're trying to say. 

Second, how is it in any way a "long scratch?" Throughout the main storyline of PL, the player is shown REPEATEDLY that 1) the NUSA/Meyers are evil, and 2) the NUSA/Meyers is willing you fuck over even their most loyal minions (Reed and Alex) when the NUSA/Meyers no longer has a use for them. It's perfectly logical and expected that the NUSA/Meyers would do the same to V.
            Reading that sentence had me laughing out loud
Yeah that’s kind of the point of the whole genre
He has a big problem with myers and knows she’s in the wrong, and yet he still submits to her when she orders him to and is willing to kill V to return So Mi to her abuser. It’s his most defining characteristic, loyal to a fault. If Reed wanted to let So Mi go, he wouldn’t have been in that shuttle.
He has a big problem with Myers, but at the end of the day he falls totally in line with everything she says and is committed to recovering Songbird - whether for his own reasons or for hers - so no, I don't feel like it was out of character that he couldn't be convinced to let her go.
At least Alex is smart enough to get out if/when she gets the chance.
Doesn't Alex say they promise u one thing and then nail ur pp to the wall?
I'm not saying you have to be mad about it.

It's just I tend to get a bit salty when the game forces you on a bad path when there are clearly better ways to handle certain situations and when these things happens it's better not to think too hard on it and just enjoy what is there.
Well the friends she mentioned are implied to be StormTech, a nomad owned company specialised in bioengineering and cybernetics so yeah that's the ending implication,
    If you believe Stormtech knows more about bioengineering and cybernetics than Arasaka, I've got a bridge to sell you.
> Grim dark is great but if it's not grounded in some amount of realism it's just a joke.

Yeah, I totally dig all the realism in that game about chroming up your body, hacking people, and basically stopping time with a machine bolted onto your spine.
    TBF there is a difference between the rules of the world being established, and a logical  narrative solution that gets ignored.

For example its established yet unrealistic that Jedis have psychic powers and shit, but thats the world they live in so its established lore. But it doesn't make sense that the emperor somehow returns. Now you can say its not the most illogical thing in that universe compared to reality, but one is established world building and the other is dumb even considering the narrative.
        Sure, I get that actually being consistent with your world rules is more important than realism in fiction. I wasn't the one throwing around that term ;)

I had not thought about Judy's response from Male V because I have barely played Male V, I was thinking her response was "stay away V because I will definitely fuck up my entire life if you come here because I can't help myself".

Again, I like the Panam is dead theory. When you kill herself she hopes you rot in hell...no way she wouldn't answer your call just to tell you to go fuck yourself. Honestly, she would probably grab the nearest ride, burn all the way through the night to get to you, walk straight up to you, punch you tell you that and then collapse in an emotional heap.
    Yeah, I felt the same way. If she's not dead, something major must have happened during those two years that changed her, and if it was something bad it's not unreasonable to blame V in addition to whatever the trauma was. I know that from V's perspective it might not seem like a big deal, but simply making the choice to trust the NUSA over the Aldecaldos to help is kind of a betrayal to the nomad way of life already even if V didn't know how long they'd be gone, especially after the whole song and dance V did with helping them not fall in with Biotechnica.

A lot of people on these subs just act like Panam's life just froze during those two years and they can't imagine that anything major might have happened. Like she's just being bitchy for no reason simply because V was gone for two years.
        I remember seeing that Panam texted several times to tell you that they got into some deep shit and they need your help (idk if she does this for male V), i assume that if she did not die during those events they lost a good chunk of the clan, and that's why they left NC. Still, it's very out of character for her to not only ghost you, but to send someone else to deliver a message for her. As soon as your name popped in the holo she wouldve picked up, even if only to tell you to fuck off herself. As prideful as she may be, she would be justified in hearing your voice for the first time in two years of no contact and just let you have it, and she would be aware of this.
No, they weren't. But she was her best friend
I just get passionate sometimes and forget myself is all lol. 

Imo, V’s influence on Myers is about as far as Myers could throw them, that being not very far. She’ll act cordial and congratulate you for returning her “property,” but she does not feel any obligation towards V. Just a cold hearted, calculating politician looking out for her own self-interest.
    I'm convinced that the reason we can't use cyberware is because Myers personally saw us destroy that Spider Tank thing and doesn't want to deal with anyone who can do that almost single handedly. But hey, Reed offered us an office job, so there's that.
        I’ve seen that take floating around. Personally, I think the relic genuinely damaged V’s nerve endings beyond repair. I feel like it makes enough sense to genuinely be true.
#BAD USER!
Empire? You mean where only Yoda dies and everybody else regroups at the end to win in the future?  Logan, never saw it. Never said I wanted a mansion either. But a movie is only 90 to 120 minutes of passive entertainment. It's not dozens of hours of playing.  How does it matter if I had friends when the moral is they'll just lose too because no one wins. Nothing you do ultimately matters if everyone loses in the world. Your character might as well die in a blaze of glory in Act 1. Your talking about movies and I'm saying what works for film might not work for a game. When I found out what the endings were I lost a lot of interest in the main story. I stopped seeing V as my avatar.
I live and eat because I have to. It's not that I don't get everything I want, I don't get anything I want.

For what its worth I think noir films are fine. But games are not film. And no noir is not popular. The fact some noir film is on a list proves nothing. If noir was popular they'd be a lot more of them. How many noir films have come out in the last 10 years? 20 years? How many were succesful? Bat Man is psuedo noir. Its super hero fantasy with noir dressing but how many Bat Man films end with him losing and the villain winning.
    >I live and eat because I have to

No you don’t. Try it! You can stop living and eating at ANY time! You’ll die but you CAN do it. You simply choose not to. 

>how many Batman films end with him losing and the villain winning

The Dark Knight

“You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain” IS “live a quiet life or die in a blaze of glory”

Joker is proven wrong but Harvey Dent is corrupted and Batman has to go into hiding. 

The Batman

The corruption of Gotham is made clear by the riddler. All of Gotham’s heroes are gone except for Batman. This whole movie is drenched in noir tropes it’s so obvious.

These are two of the biggest and most successful batman films

And the comics are just FULL of “Batman wins but loses the spiritual battle” stories.
>  so it doesn’t make much logistical sense sense to (as i believe happened) separately nuke your cyberware capacity and keep you frail afterwards.

Why not? If the NUSA views V as a potential threat, then nuking their cyberware capacity and keeping them frail makes plenty of sense. Further, if whatever they did is reversable, then it makes even more sense. If they view V as an asset, then it's as simpl as, "Hey V, we found a way to fix you, but only if you have to promise to do 'X' for us first."

>the story’s fine but it’s weird that they nuke your cyberware capacity after the treatment if you’ve proven yourself loyal, 

It's a major component of the PL storyline that all of these people are extremely paranoid. It doesn't matter how loyal you are (or appear to be), at the highest levels of NUSA politics, nobody trusts anybody and everyone expects to be backstabbed at any time. 

Just look at Reed. He's as loyal to the NUSA as it gets, but that still didn't stop Meyers from screwing him over when it benefited her. Why wouldn't the same be true of V?
>i think PL’s story makes sense, but the tower ending doesn’t quite as much.

Yes, I should've written "the problem with PL's ending". I have a lot of issues with PL's overall narrative, but I wouldn't say it doesn't make sense - outside of the ending, that is.
That's only an issue if you buy into the "NUSA nuked you on purpose" theory, which imo doesn't really have legs / clear setup - whereas the relic damage being basically impossible to fix is hammered home every time any professional takes a look at it.
    Arasaka can fix it no problem.

Even Alt can fix although it comes with a short life span but game does suggest you could be healed further.

Which is another weird loop hole why not use the alt fixes you ending than go to NUSA with the rogue AI to hammer out the details?


It doesn't add up.

Also that theory has a lot going for it. With the addition of this damage you take? Does show up in any of the normal endings so it kind if has to be something the NUSA has done
        None of them can fix it properly, I'm not quite sure where you're getting that. 

- Arasaka: probably the worst "fix", they manage to take out Johnny but your brain is still irreparably damaged by the relic & your body doesn't work properly anymore (Rubic's cube, weird visions) you can go engram or live out the remainder of your days. 

- Alt: can separate you and Johnny with no side effects but can't fix the relic brain damage; if V wants to keep the body that brain damage will kill them because the brain is already rewired to Johnny

- Nusa: can also remove Johnny and apparently can do *something* that neither Arasaka or Alt can, namely rewire the brain - you live but get long-term nerve damage from that. 

NUSA imo does clearly better than the other 2, Alt lacks the ability to physically edit the body, Arasaka lacks an AI for whatever magic that does but it's hinted constantly throughout the game that your brain is essentially fucked and that the brain is the last frontier medicine doesn't have control over (yet). Also a big part of the theory usually seems to rest on a "V is so strong Nusa wants to keep them down" but as far as the main quest is concerned V really ain't all that - they're a good Merc but every main quest interaction with others in the game (Rogue, Reed..) have an assessment ranging from "V's solid mid level, V is good" but no-one in the main quest is running around thinking V is some once in a lifetime mega legend.

The whole "use Nusa after the aldecaldos ending" isn't really a loophole as much as imo just another avenue that the open-endedness of it *could* lead to (same as to Mr blue eyes, or Arasaka or Militech, Biontech whatever). 

Meta reason imo: Narratively all the endings are supposed to be different, so there's no "here's the same ending but we plug X on top" in any of them - same for why you don't get a 5 min fix from Nusa and then an Aldecaldos ride into the sunset. Personally I like that but to each their own.
Three time gaps. Morgan was a shadow agent and operated as such, mainly under Militech. V was arguably out there fucking up the lives of megacorps and the NUSA  in broad daylight. I did account Blackhand when I posted this though so I do agree with you, hence why I said “never REALLY covered”. I can argue what V accomplished within a year makes Blackhand’s career on record almost grunt-like in comparison, but that’s just opinion. The stars (and plot armor) just aligned for V for better and for worse. For the better case, I hope CDPR and Pondsmith are making headway on releasing another sourcebook for more insight on things, including a general overview on the NC Legend that is V.
