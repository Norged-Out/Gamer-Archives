[[Battlefield 1 Cosplay]]





If it was me, I'd probably miss him and keep on sprinting straight forward.
    So it would be an accurate cosplay then. 

I can't count how many times I kinda just slid off their hitbox.
        I too, have missed the target many times.
            I miss the toilet as well
                don't joke about that (a customer hover diarrhead the other day.)
                    Sometimes it's hard to hit the toilet. Like the other day my aim was a little off and I accidentally shit in the sink.
                    Even worse, they work at a Home Depot and the toilet wasn't even hooked up to any plumbing!
                        That would be terrible. I'm at a gas station, only attendenant when I'm on shift and we don't have proper cleaning stuff for something on that magnitude. I just slapped a sign on the door and walked away.
                            I worked as a cleaner in a supermarket a few years ago. In the STAFF toilet, i found someone had shit on the lid of the toilet seat, then lifted it into the open position, smushing that turd into the wall behind it. People are animals
                        I've actually seen this happen on three separate occasions. None were at home depot though. 

Some people legitimately have never thought about why toilets work and where waste goes. They just think any toilet anywhere is functional.
                            Ever watched the movie Idiocracy?
                I miss my dog
                Can't miss it if you don't have it.

Use a shitbucket.

        Accurate cosplay and a reenactment of my sex life.

        > I kinda just slid off their hitbox

Battlefield's netcode has only gotten shitter since 4.
            Battlefield 1 has one of the best netcode of any game, look up battleNonsense's video on it.
                Never had any problems with Bf1 gameplay. Game and shooting feels absolutely fantastic. Especially when you use that 1shot sniper. Henry? If i remember correctly. Never played Bf 5 tho.
                    It's terrible, don't bother. It's three years later and I'm still having a blast on BF1.
                    Martini Henry rifle
                In the arid wasteland of Battlefield V good netcode is naught but a distant memory.
                    Don't worry, you can toggle on a netgraph that will conviniently tell you how shit hit registration is in real time. 

I don't go a day without seeing things like 600 hits client side and 450 hits server side.
                    Do people play that
                        It'll live until v5.2 breaks everything again.
                        We try. 

Pacific update is impressive, but then they do stupid shit like remove or combine playlists and change TTK **again** after huge backlash just a year ago.
        Missing is considered accurate. This boggles the mind.

r/nocontext
        Do a couple 360s trying to loop back around and get him before the animation stops, only for him to realize what's happening around him, and headshot you
        Meanwhile everyone else can charge a mile away, then when they pass you by the do a 180 instantly and stab you instantly. 

I charge within 10 feet on a prone target, and still end up running past him to say hello.
        Was expecting him to just whip out a shovel and start bashing him
        ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
        Yeah you just bump shoulders instead of bayoneting them
    only to get shot in the back, by the same guy you were so certain to kill.  
I now only use it to rush away from a shitty situation!
    Or lag at the right moment to miss. He realizes it and shoots me
    Straight into the corner of a building, and continue running for 30 seconds.

    Is he tea bagging?
    That's battlefield 5, and instead of just missing. I run into the guy like 5 times and still somehow dont bayonet them
    i'd have been killed by a dropped grenade as i was teabagging
    Don’t...don’t give me ptsd like that...
    Shit *Stab stab stab shoot DEAD*

FUCK. Not again.
    The same happens to me in MW with the riot shield
Rip bayonet

Thanks for letting me know i achieved comedy
            It was the emoji's.
                Why does Reddit have such a hard on against emojis? I think they're hilarious given the right context.
                    Because they are used in Instagram a lot and Instagram steals memes which is in most casee not true but redditors must follow the oath of hating “normies”.

    It reminds me the last time I laughed. 

Ohh the summer of 1999 when I wasn’t born yet.
        When someone reminds you that people born in 2000 are almost 20...
            Buddy people born on 9/11 are 18 now.

Oughtn't be allowed, time.
                I'm also 18 now, it's my birthday today.
                    Happy Birthday get the hell off my lawn

(I'm 31)
                        This one, FBI
                            I mean, to be fair, the entire point of the conversation was that they were 18…
                                So...not today FBI, they're legal
                        Yup, I finally got Pokémon Black. I'm not done with my childhood until I've finished that game.
                            How adorable. I was 22 when Pokémon Black was released.
                    Happy irl cake day
                        Thanks!
                    Happy Birthday kiddo. Get crazy but within limits.
                        Thanks, I shall do so!
                    Huh, legal now.

                        Thank you!
                    Let me get a crack at that freshly 18 ass. I mean Happy Birthday.
                        Hahahaha, thanks!
                    No, sorry, we have all agreed to stop time as of last night because it is bullshit.  No birthday for you.
                        Guess I'll have to stay young forever ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
                    Spend the time on yourself. Remember the people you love and love you. Be introspective about where you have been and where you are going. Most of all relax. Only advice I got for someone's birthday.
                        Thank you, that sounds like good advice!
                    Happy birthday!
                        Thanks!

What in the contractional fuck...
                    Y'all'd've been surprised at my skills.
                        The southern twang is just a rolling contraction; periods optional.
                Buddy, are you sitting there tryna tell me that a fella born 18 years ago is 18 years old?  I know I ain't hearin you right.
                I was born two months after 9/11
                    I was born less than a week before. I can technically say I was a young kid when it happened. Don't remember any of it, but I was there.
                Kids who were born after 9/11 are in the sandbox.
                Do not go gentle into that good night
                My time is coming, i'll be 18 in a few days....
            Reminds me of how [this relevant xkcd](https://xkcd.com/891/) was released nearly a decade ago.
                Wow the movie chart itself from 2011 makes me feel old because I remember seeing it
                    So do I, And I think that It's really cool that you can apply the chart to the chart itself.
                Darn, i'm not on there, was younger than 16 in 2011...need an updated version
                When i read home alone came out 20 years ago.. Shit, that hit hard, and im not even over 30.
                    You realize that chart is almost 10 yea tr s old right? Home alone came out almost 30 years ago now
                        It said 2011, so i assumed it wasnt above 2x
                    Home alone came out in 1990
                    remember that I applied the chart to the chart, so it's nearly more than 30 years ago now.
                    For me it's Finding Nemo. That was 2003?!
            Dude I bought cigs recently and failed the date check when I gave a date of 1987.  I was like oh maybe you put in 1997 instead that would make sense.

No 1997 is still old enough idk what happened.

'Yea, but like didnt they just increase the age limit to 21?'

Yes they did.  1997 should still be old enough.  Idk what happened.

*does some quick math*  'omfg I am fucking ancient...  When did this happen?'
                Holy crap, even '97 + 21 years was a year ago...
            so true. a recent ep of family guy ref ever band  i like.... ...... it was meant to be  a old timer joke to.....
                What did it for me was realizing that Ready Player One (the book, not the movie) was so popular because all the people my age are hitting their mid-life crisis.
                    Lol ...  I even before that
            Hey! Aktchually, still 9 months and a day away...so, hope you don't forget 😏😏
            Those kids will never get the cool shoe shine though.
        OK zoomer
            Zoomin’ through time for shit and giggles.
                Minus the giggles, with extra shit.
                    Sounds like a party to me
                Baby... Einstein?
            It’s Zooma for you

                1995
                    Oh oof, thought I was a millennial, guess I'm a zoomer.

Thanks!
                        The most accepted range for millenials actually is 1996 :)
                            I was 97, so I'd still miss that cut off, haha.
                        Yeah a lot of people are confused about it. The oldest millennials are in their 40s
                            There are economic factors as well as social buying habits that dictate generations, the years are just a window.
        Shit, kids born in 2000 are already old enough to have crippling depression? Man, I feel old.
        1999 BIZARRE SUMMER!
            DUH DUH NUH DUH NUH DA DA DUH NUH NUH 
*groove intensifies*
        Was it a bizarre summer
            He was born in a crazy noisy bizarre town
        What a bizarre time...
            *Bloody Stream plays*
                Wrong one but you got the spirit.

            What the fuck?
        Wholly shit thats the year I graduated high school lol.
            My Girlfriend's younger sisters, were both born the year after I graduated from High School ...

One is pregnant, the other is getting married.
                So one of them is single huh?
                    Dating two guys, last I heard ...

Can you say awkward, lol
                        Like, polyamorous?

*Noice*
                            Exactly like that, or so I heard.
                        So she's pregnant dating two guys? Or she's getting married dating two guys?
                            Pregnant, while dating two guys ...

The other one, is marrying her high school sweetheart.
                What cult? /s
                    I'm a decade older than she is, and she's a decade older than her sisters, who she helped to raise ...

So, everyone's at a fairly normal age, the combination is just squicky.
        VROOOOOOMMMMM
        Font forget the tank hoppers
        The fact that someone born in the year 2000 is now a legal adult makes me feel like Matt Damon getting old.

I'm still young! I'm still with it! YOLO swag swag! That's how we do it!
        Quit making me feel old. Gol' darn young-uns. By 1999, I was seven years old! SEVEN!
    There's something with seeing other laugh just as much as you did that is unexplicably really nice
    That's the best part of the gif tbh

        Looks rather like GenCon. Though, tbf it could be any of a number of cons.
        Looks to some sort of convention.  Could be [animecon](https://animecons.com/), or pretty much any other convention.  I know of one called [Conneticon](http://connecticon.org/) that people like to cosplay and do things like this all the time.
    Makes me think it wasn't staged and just something that happened. Or at least the teabagging wasn't part of the plan.
    He looks like a jolly monk.
    If this is actual BF1, I probably would miss the guy in prone position, and charge into the guy kneeling somehow, lol.
    That James cordon laugh
I love that the guy obviously shot and missed before going for that melee kill
    And then he shot again, and he missed

            Tried to put it back in the freezer, but it fell
                Passed out in the snow. Dreamed I was firing at something. I missed. Woke up. Had another popsicle. Fired again. I hit something, but it wasn’t what I was aiming for, so I guess I missed.
                    I passed out again
                        I woke up with a popsicle stick in my mouth.
                            Fired again, missed, had another popsicle
            So he took a nap.. Then he woke up! And he missed

In real life.
            In real life it was more likely to get stuck. Then you need to put your foot on their chest while trying to pull it out, and hope someone didnt stab you in the process.
                Is the enemy soldier alive or dead, while you're attempting to do this ...

Wait, nevermind, I'd rather not know, either option is too horrible.

And if it was BF3/4 cosplay he'd be surrounded by C4 with 4 guys standing behind him lol.
    I remember c4 ing tanks and elevators. It was hilarious. Anyone remember when we could launch vehicles in BF4 using friendly c4. Good old days...
        Got kicked off a server (but not banned) one day for doing that to random blue berries on dirt bikes lol.
Really wanted another to come along and fucking nail the guy that stabbed him
Lol t bagging from behind like real noob.
More like a crossover of a WW1 German Soldier and a WW2 British Soldier
    Pretty much just straight up WW2 for both, really.
        I think you are confused by the German steel helmet, but they were issued in the second half of WW1 as well.
            And the jackboots as opposed to wraps. I suppose by the end of the war some stormtroopers would have been looking like this, but it's definitely not how they went in. Seems much more typical of the second war, but I guess this may be technically correct.
                The stormtroopers mostly used wraps yeah, but he could be regular infantry. The germans had the [M1866 marschstiefel](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kampfstiefel_(Deutschland)#/media/Datei:Stiefel_1914.png) (marching boot).

[Here's a pic of a trench raider in body armor and with the boots](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/73/5c/dc/735cdcf4a896e8b9d474080e15c8fc90.jpg)

[This recolored picture is also kind of interesting](https://www.flickr.com/photos/79439981@N08/48264074291)
                    Reddit apps being odd and won't load search, but are you subbed to any good wwi/otherwise photo type subs that you could recommend?
        German had a trench club and some other ww1 looking gear
        The German soldier is very clearly WW1
        For the german it was a ww1 helmet. With the boots seems to be an original ww1 storm trooper.
Repost.
I didn't know SAS was around during the great war. With WW2 machine guns, as well.
    He has a maroon beret and a Dennison smock so he is more likely supposed to be a paratrooper than SAS.
        You're right, but the denison smock is the kicker. The SAS switched to a red beret for deployment in France.
        Ah yes the ww1 paratrooper
    SAS famously wear sand coloured berets.

Ever since I saw millions of those dead pool cosplay shenanigans these types of cosplay clips always make feel cringe

Found the guy who quarter squats.
I recognize that carpet. Anaheim Convention Center?
    lol damn I was convinced this was the Denver Convention Center. Maybe they have very similar carpets.
    I was gonna say Melbourne convention Centre. It's the same carpet, or close to it.
        I was at PAX Melbourne last month and I was also convinced this was Melbourne convention centre
            Yeah. With the hallway and the pillars.
    The doors, lighting, etc.  I was looking for this comment.  This is definitely Anaheim.
I would probably just trip
>BF1
>Bren gun
the camera guy so wasnt ready for the tbag at the end
the knife got bent rip
Where's the breakdancing blimp?
The man actually jabbed him hard enough that the knife bent.
This made my great grandfather very confused
What a classic! Always finishing your kills with a tee-bag. Brings me back.

Oh hey I know the German guy. Thomas Yip, he’s a cool guy and has some great re-enacting impressions and cosplays.

Why do you have do do it in a public place like boi
    maybe it's a cosplay convention
This happened to me yesterday
    Did you enjoy it?
        I’ll admit I got salty because he Tbagged me
this is an accurate representation of me in battlefield 1
The lady walking by looks so confused.

Then she couldn't care less.
LMAO this is hilarious and so realistic. Gosh I can’t believe how funny that was. Lol
Lmao the teabagging at the end rofl
If this was bf5 then the British soldier would have a clown costume on
Do you see the way he looks around to make sure he is safe from other enemy players, then does the bunny hopping?
    That's teabagging
        The fact that some gamers today don't even know what t-bagging is makes me sad.
    Upvote for making it wholesome!
Yeah basically that's the whole  game
Looks like anaheim convention center
James Cordan laughing
That game is where I learned about the term teabag. So good.
Anaheim convention center?
That guy went all out on getting the whole kit! Those tornister packs aren't cheap.
Perfect
Hey isn’t that the Anaheim Convention Center?
A-HA!

Forgive the buzzwords but Battlefield 1 is the most immersive gritty war experience I've gotten from any game. Still active servers on PC
He didn’t get sniped mid tea-bag, unrealistic
Man I love a bren, it's my grail gun.
General Repost!  Reporting for teabagging duty!
Damn in gonna miss this game so many memories :(
It’s not battlefield unless another guy comes up behind the teabagger and melees him, then that guy pretends to be blown up by a dynamite.
That's some good replica of the Madsen
I’d do literally just that playing BF1. Melee fuck up enemy campers, it’s so satisfying with the bayonet.
What convention let's you carry gun props that realistic? And no orange tip?
He actually stabbed him and didnt run circles around him until being shot? 0/10 not accurate
Actual footage from The Great War
Mgo had major tea bagging as well
u/vredditdownloader
It needs a medic crawling by his downed mate, not reviving him.
The realism is unmatched
Was this at gameon?
Most realistic cosplay. Period
Is this the type of an event where dudes in costumes walk around with a hard on?
Accuracy 101
They arrested a guy at the comicon I was at last. Was carrying a real gun, cops were everywhere. They weren’t letting anyone bring in fake guns or anything. How common is it at comicons to be able to have your prop guns, or not?

I’m boutta do some “ no russian” cosplay wish me luck!
F
Crazy what the past looks like when they add some color. I think this was my grandfather from the Great War
That bent bayonet though
I would have use The 1000 years of suffering
The person walking by thought it was real for a split second lol
I remember when this wasnt 7 pixels
That T-bag got me laughing
Why is that in an airport
i just realized the guy dressed like a German is black. Very accurate for BF1.
This is a buddy of mine from high school. Glad to see his post make it onto Reddit😂
Don't conventions normally require orange tips?
    (Adjusts trousers)

Oh, on the guns?!
Game sucks
Ah yes, the tea bagging.
The good o'L T-bag
Support player, bipod deployed in the middle of nowhere, looking away from the fight? 

That’s not just a Battlefield One cosplay, that’s a pretty accurate general Battlefield cosplay.
More bf5 bc the man on the floor has a bren gun and a paratrooper beret
And then he should do the slowed down moving away bit that inevitably follows
Why does the guy laying down looks like Maestro from Rainbow Six Siege?
omg 😂😂😂
Iconic.
I read borderlands and was very confused at first.
I’m not a cosplayer but I thought made some rule about realistic looking weapons not be allowed?
Tea. Earl Grey. Hot.
Bf1>Bf5
best cosplay ever
Yeees. Cosplay.
Good video, but classic repost
I love how they took the time to colorize all of the old clips from world war 1

It's gives us such a different perspective, bringing a real humanity to the horror of war
That’s me in school
I like how everyone involved played along. This was great
If I saw these guys at a convention I would think there was going to be a shooting.
*salvation army remix intensifies*
The video quality gets worse every repost, but I love this too much not to upvote.
Why is the fact that his bayonet got bent the funniest part for me?
Yea but...EA. Sorry! I just don't think it's a good idea to glorify a company that markets their games like virtual casinos for children :/ mabye next time do a cosplay of a game from a morally forward company (like the Witcher 3 ;)
Funniest part is the person walking in the background.  They didn't even react to any of it, lol......
This is too accurate
Beautiful... just beautiful
Every online game
Tea bag lol
This cosplay means absolutley nothing if he isn't screaming like his dick is on fire.
u/vredditdownloader
Insult to injury
What is this for? That's at the Anaheim Convention Center, but not sure what event that is
#FÜR UNSERE KAISER!!!!!
This is the greatest cosplay of All Time
German soldier's Instagram is @alex.read626 . He does some funny shit
Oh no 360° no scope? What is this amateur hour?
Was this youmacon?
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78mgAaKdBRo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78mgAaKdBRo)
Pretty accurate if you ask me.
A bit surprised they let them in with those props, they're pretty realistic looking and no orange end piece on the barrel.
That's so accurate
He really tried to stab him with that knife... Look how bent it is afterwards. lol
Aaah the good old mushroom stamp. <3
How rude
Epic
Seen this so many times on Reddit... and I will upvote it every time! It's so perfect.
Dip,Dip, Potato chip!
Missing the other folks rushing in for melee
Kill does count until you tea bag
Are there friars in battlefield?
So True haha 😭
Aww man, I feel really bad for our kiwi Seige, Battlefield and so on cosplayers. All military style cosplays  and realistic style guns are banned from our conventions since the Christchurch shootings . Even the Star Wars 501st can't carry guns anymore :(    Although there has been an upsurge of people crafting large foam bananas in place of weapons.
Typical life of a troller
The teabag at the end had me screaming
I would bust out laughing if i saw this at a con
British soldier in the trenches of Somme.

"Someday this will be funny"
I always suspected they got rid of the long wasted cam in gta because they knew everyone online would just get teabagged constantly
The guys reaction to the tea-bagging made this whole thing.
People who “cosplay” historical soldiers are just playing dress up as soldiers. It has nothing to do with cosplaying as a favorite character, but to wear their reproduced german helmets.
    “Im just really into authentic reenactment”  okay nazi
so accurate
I would’ve just sniped him with a hunter shotgun
Did anyone else expect a third guy to come and take out the second guy?
    Was hoping for it TBH.  Evidently that teabagging hit too close to home.
He'll write the guy a heartfelt note saying he was just trying to not get shot in the head.
It’s hurts how true that is
More games need to implement tea bagging again.
Tee Baging is Still A Thing in EveryGame So...
The guy laughing was the best part of this gif
    The aesthetics of this video made me so anxious
Can't imagine that guy actually dressing as a German soldier without getting his ass kicked by a bunch of psychopaths.
I thought he was gonna shove it up his arse
He's gonna need a new bayonet
God I just cringed so hard
Would love to see a Halo version of this.
Buddy’s bayonet broke
Im just sad he fucked up his knife
Tactical crouching at its finest.
He bent his bayonet.
So it would be an accurate cosplay then. 

I can't count how many times I kinda just slid off their hitbox.
    I too, have missed the target many times.
        I miss the toilet as well
            don't joke about that (a customer hover diarrhead the other day.)
                Sometimes it's hard to hit the toilet. Like the other day my aim was a little off and I accidentally shit in the sink.
                Even worse, they work at a Home Depot and the toilet wasn't even hooked up to any plumbing!
                    That would be terrible. I'm at a gas station, only attendenant when I'm on shift and we don't have proper cleaning stuff for something on that magnitude. I just slapped a sign on the door and walked away.
                        I worked as a cleaner in a supermarket a few years ago. In the STAFF toilet, i found someone had shit on the lid of the toilet seat, then lifted it into the open position, smushing that turd into the wall behind it. People are animals
                    I've actually seen this happen on three separate occasions. None were at home depot though. 

Some people legitimately have never thought about why toilets work and where waste goes. They just think any toilet anywhere is functional.
                        Ever watched the movie Idiocracy?
            I miss my dog
            Can't miss it if you don't have it.

    > I kinda just slid off their hitbox

Battlefield's netcode has only gotten shitter since 4.
        Battlefield 1 has one of the best netcode of any game, look up battleNonsense's video on it.
            Never had any problems with Bf1 gameplay. Game and shooting feels absolutely fantastic. Especially when you use that 1shot sniper. Henry? If i remember correctly. Never played Bf 5 tho.
                It's terrible, don't bother. It's three years later and I'm still having a blast on BF1.
                Martini Henry rifle
            In the arid wasteland of Battlefield V good netcode is naught but a distant memory.
                Don't worry, you can toggle on a netgraph that will conviniently tell you how shit hit registration is in real time. 

I don't go a day without seeing things like 600 hits client side and 450 hits server side.
                Do people play that
                    It'll live until v5.2 breaks everything again.
                    We try. 

Pacific update is impressive, but then they do stupid shit like remove or combine playlists and change TTK **again** after huge backlash just a year ago.
    Missing is considered accurate. This boggles the mind.
    > I can’t count how many times I kinda just slid off their hit box

r/nocontext
    Do a couple 360s trying to loop back around and get him before the animation stops, only for him to realize what's happening around him, and headshot you
    Meanwhile everyone else can charge a mile away, then when they pass you by the do a 180 instantly and stab you instantly. 

I charge within 10 feet on a prone target, and still end up running past him to say hello.
    Was expecting him to just whip out a shovel and start bashing him
    ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
    Yeah you just bump shoulders instead of bayoneting them
only to get shot in the back, by the same guy you were so certain to kill.  
I now only use it to rush away from a shitty situation!
Or lag at the right moment to miss. He realizes it and shoots me
Straight into the corner of a building, and continue running for 30 seconds.

Is he tea bagging?
That's battlefield 5, and instead of just missing. I run into the guy like 5 times and still somehow dont bayonet them
i'd have been killed by a dropped grenade as i was teabagging
Don’t...don’t give me ptsd like that...
Shit *Stab stab stab shoot DEAD*

FUCK. Not again.
The same happens to me in MW with the riot shield
And that poor guy lying there holy shit that's dedication imagine dying for cosplay

            Why does Reddit have such a hard on against emojis? I think they're hilarious given the right context.
                Because they are used in Instagram a lot and Instagram steals memes which is in most casee not true but redditors must follow the oath of hating “normies”.

What in the contractional fuck...
                Y'all'd've been surprised at my skills.

            Buddy, are you sitting there tryna tell me that a fella born 18 years ago is 18 years old?  I know I ain't hearin you right.
            I was born two months after 9/11
                I was born less than a week before. I can technically say I was a young kid when it happened. Don't remember any of it, but I was there.
            Kids who were born after 9/11 are in the sandbox.
            Do not go gentle into that good night
            My time is coming, i'll be 18 in a few days....
        Reminds me of how [this relevant xkcd](https://xkcd.com/891/) was released nearly a decade ago.
            Wow the movie chart itself from 2011 makes me feel old because I remember seeing it
                So do I, And I think that It's really cool that you can apply the chart to the chart itself.
            Darn, i'm not on there, was younger than 16 in 2011...need an updated version
            When i read home alone came out 20 years ago.. Shit, that hit hard, and im not even over 30.
                You realize that chart is almost 10 yea tr s old right? Home alone came out almost 30 years ago now
                    It said 2011, so i assumed it wasnt above 2x
                Home alone came out in 1990
                remember that I applied the chart to the chart, so it's nearly more than 30 years ago now.
                For me it's Finding Nemo. That was 2003?!
        Dude I bought cigs recently and failed the date check when I gave a date of 1987.  I was like oh maybe you put in 1997 instead that would make sense.

No 1997 is still old enough idk what happened.

'Yea, but like didnt they just increase the age limit to 21?'

Yes they did.  1997 should still be old enough.  Idk what happened.

*does some quick math*  'omfg I am fucking ancient...  When did this happen?'
            Holy crap, even '97 + 21 years was a year ago...
        so true. a recent ep of family guy ref ever band  i like.... ...... it was meant to be  a old timer joke to.....
            What did it for me was realizing that Ready Player One (the book, not the movie) was so popular because all the people my age are hitting their mid-life crisis.

                    The most accepted range for millenials actually is 1996 :)
                        I was 97, so I'd still miss that cut off, haha.
                    Yeah a lot of people are confused about it. The oldest millennials are in their 40s
                        There are economic factors as well as social buying habits that dictate generations, the years are just a window.
    Shit, kids born in 2000 are already old enough to have crippling depression? Man, I feel old.

        What the fuck?
    Wholly shit thats the year I graduated high school lol.
        My Girlfriend's younger sisters, were both born the year after I graduated from High School ...

One is pregnant, the other is getting married.
            So one of them is single huh?
                Dating two guys, last I heard ...

Can you say awkward, lol
                    Like, polyamorous?

*Noice*
                        Exactly like that, or so I heard.
                    So she's pregnant dating two guys? Or she's getting married dating two guys?
                        Pregnant, while dating two guys ...

The other one, is marrying her high school sweetheart.
            What cult? /s
                I'm a decade older than she is, and she's a decade older than her sisters, who she helped to raise ...

So, everyone's at a fairly normal age, the combination is just squicky.
    VROOOOOOMMMMM
    Font forget the tank hoppers
    The fact that someone born in the year 2000 is now a legal adult makes me feel like Matt Damon getting old.

I'm still young! I'm still with it! YOLO swag swag! That's how we do it!
    Quit making me feel old. Gol' darn young-uns. By 1999, I was seven years old! SEVEN!
There's something with seeing other laugh just as much as you did that is unexplicably really nice
That's the best part of the gif tbh

    Looks rather like GenCon. Though, tbf it could be any of a number of cons.
    Looks to some sort of convention.  Could be [animecon](https://animecons.com/), or pretty much any other convention.  I know of one called [Conneticon](http://connecticon.org/) that people like to cosplay and do things like this all the time.
Makes me think it wasn't staged and just something that happened. Or at least the teabagging wasn't part of the plan.
He looks like a jolly monk.
If this is actual BF1, I probably would miss the guy in prone position, and charge into the guy kneeling somehow, lol.
That James cordon laugh
And then he shot again, and he missed

        Tried to put it back in the freezer, but it fell
            Passed out in the snow. Dreamed I was firing at something. I missed. Woke up. Had another popsicle. Fired again. I hit something, but it wasn’t what I was aiming for, so I guess I missed.
                I passed out again
                    I woke up with a popsicle stick in my mouth.
                        Fired again, missed, had another popsicle
        So he took a nap.. Then he woke up! And he missed

            Is the enemy soldier alive or dead, while you're attempting to do this ...

I remember c4 ing tanks and elevators. It was hilarious. Anyone remember when we could launch vehicles in BF4 using friendly c4. Good old days...
    Got kicked off a server (but not banned) one day for doing that to random blue berries on dirt bikes lol.
Pretty much just straight up WW2 for both, really.
    I think you are confused by the German steel helmet, but they were issued in the second half of WW1 as well.
        And the jackboots as opposed to wraps. I suppose by the end of the war some stormtroopers would have been looking like this, but it's definitely not how they went in. Seems much more typical of the second war, but I guess this may be technically correct.
            The stormtroopers mostly used wraps yeah, but he could be regular infantry. The germans had the [M1866 marschstiefel](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kampfstiefel_(Deutschland)#/media/Datei:Stiefel_1914.png) (marching boot).

[Here's a pic of a trench raider in body armor and with the boots](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/73/5c/dc/735cdcf4a896e8b9d474080e15c8fc90.jpg)

[This recolored picture is also kind of interesting](https://www.flickr.com/photos/79439981@N08/48264074291)
                Reddit apps being odd and won't load search, but are you subbed to any good wwi/otherwise photo type subs that you could recommend?
    German had a trench club and some other ww1 looking gear
    The German soldier is very clearly WW1
    For the german it was a ww1 helmet. With the boots seems to be an original ww1 storm trooper.
He has a maroon beret and a Dennison smock so he is more likely supposed to be a paratrooper than SAS.
    You're right, but the denison smock is the kicker. The SAS switched to a red beret for deployment in France.
    Ah yes the ww1 paratrooper
SAS famously wear sand coloured berets.
lol damn I was convinced this was the Denver Convention Center. Maybe they have very similar carpets.
I was gonna say Melbourne convention Centre. It's the same carpet, or close to it.
    I was at PAX Melbourne last month and I was also convinced this was Melbourne convention centre
        Yeah. With the hallway and the pillars.
The doors, lighting, etc.  I was looking for this comment.  This is definitely Anaheim.
They're like "why didn't we do that?"
maybe it's a cosplay convention
Did you enjoy it?
    I’ll admit I got salty because he Tbagged me
That's teabagging
    The fact that some gamers today don't even know what t-bagging is makes me sad.
Upvote for making it wholesome!
(Adjusts trousers)

Oh, on the guns?!
“Im just really into authentic reenactment”  okay nazi
Was hoping for it TBH.  Evidently that teabagging hit too close to home.
The aesthetics of this video made me so anxious
I too, have missed the target many times.
    I miss the toilet as well
        don't joke about that (a customer hover diarrhead the other day.)
            Sometimes it's hard to hit the toilet. Like the other day my aim was a little off and I accidentally shit in the sink.
            Even worse, they work at a Home Depot and the toilet wasn't even hooked up to any plumbing!
                That would be terrible. I'm at a gas station, only attendenant when I'm on shift and we don't have proper cleaning stuff for something on that magnitude. I just slapped a sign on the door and walked away.
                    I worked as a cleaner in a supermarket a few years ago. In the STAFF toilet, i found someone had shit on the lid of the toilet seat, then lifted it into the open position, smushing that turd into the wall behind it. People are animals
                I've actually seen this happen on three separate occasions. None were at home depot though. 

Some people legitimately have never thought about why toilets work and where waste goes. They just think any toilet anywhere is functional.
                    Ever watched the movie Idiocracy?
        I miss my dog
        Can't miss it if you don't have it.

> I kinda just slid off their hitbox

Battlefield's netcode has only gotten shitter since 4.
    Battlefield 1 has one of the best netcode of any game, look up battleNonsense's video on it.
        Never had any problems with Bf1 gameplay. Game and shooting feels absolutely fantastic. Especially when you use that 1shot sniper. Henry? If i remember correctly. Never played Bf 5 tho.
            It's terrible, don't bother. It's three years later and I'm still having a blast on BF1.
            Martini Henry rifle
        In the arid wasteland of Battlefield V good netcode is naught but a distant memory.
            Don't worry, you can toggle on a netgraph that will conviniently tell you how shit hit registration is in real time. 

I don't go a day without seeing things like 600 hits client side and 450 hits server side.
            Do people play that
                It'll live until v5.2 breaks everything again.
                We try. 

Pacific update is impressive, but then they do stupid shit like remove or combine playlists and change TTK **again** after huge backlash just a year ago.
Missing is considered accurate. This boggles the mind.
> I can’t count how many times I kinda just slid off their hit box

r/nocontext
Do a couple 360s trying to loop back around and get him before the animation stops, only for him to realize what's happening around him, and headshot you
Meanwhile everyone else can charge a mile away, then when they pass you by the do a 180 instantly and stab you instantly. 

I charge within 10 feet on a prone target, and still end up running past him to say hello.
Was expecting him to just whip out a shovel and start bashing him
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Yeah you just bump shoulders instead of bayoneting them

                    I mean, to be fair, the entire point of the conversation was that they were 18…
                        So...not today FBI, they're legal
                Yup, I finally got Pokémon Black. I'm not done with my childhood until I've finished that game.

        Buddy, are you sitting there tryna tell me that a fella born 18 years ago is 18 years old?  I know I ain't hearin you right.
        I was born two months after 9/11
            I was born less than a week before. I can technically say I was a young kid when it happened. Don't remember any of it, but I was there.
        Kids who were born after 9/11 are in the sandbox.
        Do not go gentle into that good night
        My time is coming, i'll be 18 in a few days....
    Reminds me of how [this relevant xkcd](https://xkcd.com/891/) was released nearly a decade ago.
        Wow the movie chart itself from 2011 makes me feel old because I remember seeing it
            So do I, And I think that It's really cool that you can apply the chart to the chart itself.
        Darn, i'm not on there, was younger than 16 in 2011...need an updated version
        When i read home alone came out 20 years ago.. Shit, that hit hard, and im not even over 30.
            You realize that chart is almost 10 yea tr s old right? Home alone came out almost 30 years ago now
                It said 2011, so i assumed it wasnt above 2x
            Home alone came out in 1990
            remember that I applied the chart to the chart, so it's nearly more than 30 years ago now.
            For me it's Finding Nemo. That was 2003?!
    Dude I bought cigs recently and failed the date check when I gave a date of 1987.  I was like oh maybe you put in 1997 instead that would make sense.

No 1997 is still old enough idk what happened.

'Yea, but like didnt they just increase the age limit to 21?'

Yes they did.  1997 should still be old enough.  Idk what happened.

*does some quick math*  'omfg I am fucking ancient...  When did this happen?'
        Holy crap, even '97 + 21 years was a year ago...
    so true. a recent ep of family guy ref ever band  i like.... ...... it was meant to be  a old timer joke to.....
        What did it for me was realizing that Ready Player One (the book, not the movie) was so popular because all the people my age are hitting their mid-life crisis.

                The most accepted range for millenials actually is 1996 :)
                    I was 97, so I'd still miss that cut off, haha.
                Yeah a lot of people are confused about it. The oldest millennials are in their 40s
                    There are economic factors as well as social buying habits that dictate generations, the years are just a window.

Looks rather like GenCon. Though, tbf it could be any of a number of cons.
Looks to some sort of convention.  Could be [animecon](https://animecons.com/), or pretty much any other convention.  I know of one called [Conneticon](http://connecticon.org/) that people like to cosplay and do things like this all the time.

That would be, um, embarrassing ...

In real life.
    In real life it was more likely to get stuck. Then you need to put your foot on their chest while trying to pull it out, and hope someone didnt stab you in the process.
        Is the enemy soldier alive or dead, while you're attempting to do this ...

Wait, nevermind, I'd rather not know, either option is too horrible.
            Halfway between both
Oof
Got kicked off a server (but not banned) one day for doing that to random blue berries on dirt bikes lol.
I think you are confused by the German steel helmet, but they were issued in the second half of WW1 as well.
    And the jackboots as opposed to wraps. I suppose by the end of the war some stormtroopers would have been looking like this, but it's definitely not how they went in. Seems much more typical of the second war, but I guess this may be technically correct.
        The stormtroopers mostly used wraps yeah, but he could be regular infantry. The germans had the [M1866 marschstiefel](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kampfstiefel_(Deutschland)#/media/Datei:Stiefel_1914.png) (marching boot).

            Reddit apps being odd and won't load search, but are you subbed to any good wwi/otherwise photo type subs that you could recommend?
German had a trench club and some other ww1 looking gear
The German soldier is very clearly WW1
For the german it was a ww1 helmet. With the boots seems to be an original ww1 storm trooper.
You're right, but the denison smock is the kicker. The SAS switched to a red beret for deployment in France.
Ah yes the ww1 paratrooper
I was at PAX Melbourne last month and I was also convinced this was Melbourne convention centre
    Yeah. With the hallway and the pillars.
I’ll admit I got salty because he Tbagged me
The fact that some gamers today don't even know what t-bagging is makes me sad.
I miss the toilet as well
    don't joke about that (a customer hover diarrhead the other day.)
        Sometimes it's hard to hit the toilet. Like the other day my aim was a little off and I accidentally shit in the sink.
        Even worse, they work at a Home Depot and the toilet wasn't even hooked up to any plumbing!
            That would be terrible. I'm at a gas station, only attendenant when I'm on shift and we don't have proper cleaning stuff for something on that magnitude. I just slapped a sign on the door and walked away.
                I worked as a cleaner in a supermarket a few years ago. In the STAFF toilet, i found someone had shit on the lid of the toilet seat, then lifted it into the open position, smushing that turd into the wall behind it. People are animals
            I've actually seen this happen on three separate occasions. None were at home depot though. 

Some people legitimately have never thought about why toilets work and where waste goes. They just think any toilet anywhere is functional.
                Ever watched the movie Idiocracy?

Battlefield 1 has one of the best netcode of any game, look up battleNonsense's video on it.
    Never had any problems with Bf1 gameplay. Game and shooting feels absolutely fantastic. Especially when you use that 1shot sniper. Henry? If i remember correctly. Never played Bf 5 tho.
        It's terrible, don't bother. It's three years later and I'm still having a blast on BF1.

    In the arid wasteland of Battlefield V good netcode is naught but a distant memory.
        Don't worry, you can toggle on a netgraph that will conviniently tell you how shit hit registration is in real time. 

I don't go a day without seeing things like 600 hits client side and 450 hits server side.
        Do people play that
            It'll live until v5.2 breaks everything again.
            We try. 

Pacific update is impressive, but then they do stupid shit like remove or combine playlists and change TTK **again** after huge backlash just a year ago.
It was the emoji's.
    Why does Reddit have such a hard on against emojis? I think they're hilarious given the right context.

            Yup, I finally got Pokémon Black. I'm not done with my childhood until I've finished that game.
                How adorable. I was 22 when Pokémon Black was released.
        Happy irl cake day

        No, sorry, we have all agreed to stop time as of last night because it is bullshit.  No birthday for you.
            Guess I'll have to stay young forever ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
        Spend the time on yourself. Remember the people you love and love you. Be introspective about where you have been and where you are going. Most of all relax. Only advice I got for someone's birthday.

    Buddy, are you sitting there tryna tell me that a fella born 18 years ago is 18 years old?  I know I ain't hearin you right.
    I was born two months after 9/11
        I was born less than a week before. I can technically say I was a young kid when it happened. Don't remember any of it, but I was there.
    Kids who were born after 9/11 are in the sandbox.
    Do not go gentle into that good night
    My time is coming, i'll be 18 in a few days....
Reminds me of how [this relevant xkcd](https://xkcd.com/891/) was released nearly a decade ago.
    Wow the movie chart itself from 2011 makes me feel old because I remember seeing it
        So do I, And I think that It's really cool that you can apply the chart to the chart itself.
    Darn, i'm not on there, was younger than 16 in 2011...need an updated version
    When i read home alone came out 20 years ago.. Shit, that hit hard, and im not even over 30.
        You realize that chart is almost 10 yea tr s old right? Home alone came out almost 30 years ago now
            It said 2011, so i assumed it wasnt above 2x
        Home alone came out in 1990
        remember that I applied the chart to the chart, so it's nearly more than 30 years ago now.
        For me it's Finding Nemo. That was 2003?!
Dude I bought cigs recently and failed the date check when I gave a date of 1987.  I was like oh maybe you put in 1997 instead that would make sense.

No 1997 is still old enough idk what happened.

'Yea, but like didnt they just increase the age limit to 21?'

Yes they did.  1997 should still be old enough.  Idk what happened.

*does some quick math*  'omfg I am fucking ancient...  When did this happen?'
    Holy crap, even '97 + 21 years was a year ago...
so true. a recent ep of family guy ref ever band  i like.... ...... it was meant to be  a old timer joke to.....
    What did it for me was realizing that Ready Player One (the book, not the movie) was so popular because all the people my age are hitting their mid-life crisis.
        Lol ...  I even before that
Hey! Aktchually, still 9 months and a day away...so, hope you don't forget 😏😏

Thanks!
            The most accepted range for millenials actually is 1996 :)
                I was 97, so I'd still miss that cut off, haha.
            Yeah a lot of people are confused about it. The oldest millennials are in their 40s
                There are economic factors as well as social buying habits that dictate generations, the years are just a window.

My Girlfriend's younger sisters, were both born the year after I graduated from High School ...

One is pregnant, the other is getting married.
    So one of them is single huh?
        Dating two guys, last I heard ...

Can you say awkward, lol
            Like, polyamorous?

*Noice*
                Exactly like that, or so I heard.
            So she's pregnant dating two guys? Or she's getting married dating two guys?
                Pregnant, while dating two guys ...

The other one, is marrying her high school sweetheart.
    What cult? /s
        I'm a decade older than she is, and she's a decade older than her sisters, who she helped to raise ...

So, everyone's at a fairly normal age, the combination is just squicky.
Tried to put it back in the freezer, but it fell
    Passed out in the snow. Dreamed I was firing at something. I missed. Woke up. Had another popsicle. Fired again. I hit something, but it wasn’t what I was aiming for, so I guess I missed.
        I passed out again
            I woke up with a popsicle stick in my mouth.
                Fired again, missed, had another popsicle
So he took a nap.. Then he woke up! And he missed

Apparently Fenton's owner did an interview about it afterwards.
Is the enemy soldier alive or dead, while you're attempting to do this ...

Wait, nevermind, I'd rather not know, either option is too horrible.

The stormtroopers mostly used wraps yeah, but he could be regular infantry. The germans had the [M1866 marschstiefel](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kampfstiefel_(Deutschland)#/media/Datei:Stiefel_1914.png) (marching boot).

Sometimes it's hard to hit the toilet. Like the other day my aim was a little off and I accidentally shit in the sink.
Even worse, they work at a Home Depot and the toilet wasn't even hooked up to any plumbing!
    That would be terrible. I'm at a gas station, only attendenant when I'm on shift and we don't have proper cleaning stuff for something on that magnitude. I just slapped a sign on the door and walked away.
        I worked as a cleaner in a supermarket a few years ago. In the STAFF toilet, i found someone had shit on the lid of the toilet seat, then lifted it into the open position, smushing that turd into the wall behind it. People are animals
    I've actually seen this happen on three separate occasions. None were at home depot though. 

Some people legitimately have never thought about why toilets work and where waste goes. They just think any toilet anywhere is functional.
        Ever watched the movie Idiocracy?
It's terrible, don't bother. It's three years later and I'm still having a blast on BF1.

Don't worry, you can toggle on a netgraph that will conviniently tell you how shit hit registration is in real time. 

I don't go a day without seeing things like 600 hits client side and 450 hits server side.
Do people play that
    It'll live until v5.2 breaks everything again.

Pacific update is impressive, but then they do stupid shit like remove or combine playlists and change TTK **again** after huge backlash just a year ago.
Because they are used in Instagram a lot and Instagram steals memes which is in most casee not true but redditors must follow the oath of hating “normies”.

    This one, FBI
        I mean, to be fair, the entire point of the conversation was that they were 18…
            So...not today FBI, they're legal
    Yup, I finally got Pokémon Black. I'm not done with my childhood until I've finished that game.
        How adorable. I was 22 when Pokémon Black was released.
Happy irl cake day
    Thanks!
Happy Birthday kiddo. Get crazy but within limits.
    Thanks, I shall do so!
Huh, legal now.

    Thanks!
Happy day of unbecoming!
    Thank you!
Let me get a crack at that freshly 18 ass. I mean Happy Birthday.
    Hahahaha, thanks!
No, sorry, we have all agreed to stop time as of last night because it is bullshit.  No birthday for you.
    Guess I'll have to stay young forever ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
Spend the time on yourself. Remember the people you love and love you. Be introspective about where you have been and where you are going. Most of all relax. Only advice I got for someone's birthday.
    Thank you, that sounds like good advice!
Happy birthday!
    Thanks!
Y'all'd've been surprised at my skills.

I was born less than a week before. I can technically say I was a young kid when it happened. Don't remember any of it, but I was there.
So do I, And I think that It's really cool that you can apply the chart to the chart itself.
You realize that chart is almost 10 yea tr s old right? Home alone came out almost 30 years ago now
    It said 2011, so i assumed it wasnt above 2x
Home alone came out in 1990
remember that I applied the chart to the chart, so it's nearly more than 30 years ago now.
For me it's Finding Nemo. That was 2003?!
Lol ...  I even before that
Sounds like a party to me
It’s just an Aussie sayin’ it.

Oh oof, thought I was a millennial, guess I'm a zoomer.

Thanks!
    The most accepted range for millenials actually is 1996 :)
        I was 97, so I'd still miss that cut off, haha.
    Yeah a lot of people are confused about it. The oldest millennials are in their 40s
        There are economic factors as well as social buying habits that dictate generations, the years are just a window.
Dating two guys, last I heard ...

Can you say awkward, lol
    Like, polyamorous?

*Noice*
        Exactly like that, or so I heard.
    So she's pregnant dating two guys? Or she's getting married dating two guys?
        Pregnant, while dating two guys ...

The other one, is marrying her high school sweetheart.
I'm a decade older than she is, and she's a decade older than her sisters, who she helped to raise ...

So, everyone's at a fairly normal age, the combination is just squicky.

    I woke up with a popsicle stick in my mouth.
