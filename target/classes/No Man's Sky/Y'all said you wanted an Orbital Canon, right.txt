[[Y'all said you wanted an Orbital Canon, right]]





I've never seen a dad joke with so much effort put into it. Bravo.
You are welcome to visit, but be warned: it sits above an awfully shitty planet. Wear a jacket.

Oh my. This is one of those rare posts that made me literally laugh out loud. Kudos to you my friend.
When the meme started I began thinking about how you'd go about doing something like this, but I just couldn't...  picture it.
Please tell me you’re a dad. Couse that is the best dad joke ever! 😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣
    We do not have kids. But I refuse to let that stop me.

That's not a canon, its off brand
    Kanon
    Not canon to the story like GT in DragonBall!
Nice one, dad!
That's a Nikkon you amateur /s
Now THAT'S an orbital Cannon I can get behind!

Now we can do some serious photo missions!
I hate that I sat here going “that’s not a cannon that’s a camera” before it clicked in my mind
    Same, but it took me seeing your comment to realise as well! Got one up on me at least.
    Me too… me too
This is a great pun
This is the best post ive seen on this sub for a while now, haha, bravo
That’s a Nikon, mate.
Bwah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! This had me cackling like a crazy person in my office. Thank you

The sheer dedication, hats off my man hats off.
Finally i can analyse smol animals.
 Ah yes, Photon Canon
    Nice, dude. Nice.
*slow claps*
How do you all make shit that's this big? It blows my tiny little monkey brain
That’s great a build. And clever though to do something like this. A good way to answer everyone wish in the game
Yo dawg, heard you like photos. Here's a photo of a photographic device that photographs photos.
    How the photo of the worlds first camera was taken?
        With the world's second camera?
Such a cheesy fucking pun that just wrecked my shit and has me dying. And a cool build to go with it?! Laughed way too hard at this lol. Good on you and take your upvote you saucy interloper!
    no offense but this is the most reddit comment ive ever seen
        I’m high AF right now. I’m sure I’ll read this later and cringe.
I snorted so hard it hurt. 😁
Today I learned you can build in the sky 🤯
NASA spending all that money & we coulda just done this
Nah dude i said nikon. But this is ok. Good job ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|upvote)
Smile! You're about to be nuked!
    You mean photo bombed
I love well executed puns.
You are the hero we need
    … but not the one this subreddit deserves
        Indeed
Dad joke deployed
So where did all this random out of the blue hype for orbital cannons come from?
    PvP sweats looking for instant gratification /s
Is funny because now Death Star is Rebel EOS
Haha that's awesome 😂

I can't even imagine the patience and time that took to make (all for a bit of cheeky wordplay, no less!), but my brain still wants me to say "Ooh, do a Polaroid (Solaroid?) next please!"

    Dammit, you beat me to it!
Looks like we still don’t have an orbital canon, this is an orbital Sony IMO
This is the only acceptable one.
Points for smart-assery aside, that is very impressive
No gonna lie, you had me in the first half.
nice camera
I'm out of the loop, why are people all of a sudden yelling about orbital cannons?
    To revive the Empire
        To destroy Alderaan
All these comments of people obviously not knowing what a Canon is make me feel old :(
    I'm not old. You're old
Finally, someone listened. Thank you.
Orbital Canon Rebel Base...

...I canon believe he did this, I think he's snapped...

...my photography friend loves this, I cant shutter up about it...
Oh my GOD 

Just take it. /r/AngryUpvote
Id rather have an orbital nikannon.
That’s a decepticon. You can’t fool me.
Say cheese!

Pretty sure that’s a Decepticon.

I guess naming my base planet Alderaan wasn't a good idea
    No, no it was not

That is a great orbital Canon! 📷
What’s it capable of shooting?
    Anything within its visual range.
Nice! Can it do selfies from orbit?
Spy game just ranked up haha. Ridiculously amazing ahaha. I'll take one thanks.
You have my respect fellow traveler. That's amazing.😁👍
I said cannon not nikon
The smartassery and audacity to mock us and our cannons!!!


10/10 very well played and built
That made me exhale quiet loud. 

Thank you for this, nice one
I love this and hate it in equal measure
Shut up I love you
I can get behind this Canon.
You son of a…
Dude. This is awesome. Please post or link some interior pics.
    Glyphs in the photo. You can visit.

There's nothing inside. I do have a viewing platform close by, though, which is where the teleporter at the station will take you.
        I will visit soon. Saw the glyphs earlier. Just wondered what was inside. Would be a such a cool home base, especially with a landing pad "hidden" behind that rear screen and a takeoff vector going through the lens. 

Great concept 👌
Brilliant!!!
Listen here you little ...
Mag-fucking-nificent! Take a bow.
LMFAO!!!
this is the funniest thing I've seen all week
Took me a second to get this but well played

As a photographer, who uses a canon, you know, I’ll be visiting here! This is amazing! 📸💞
Need longer telescopic lens so I can blast a 10K light-year galaxy into smithereens

I see what you did there..
Now you can see the interloper in the next system picking their nose... Score..
This is trolling of the highest order.
Excellent work.

    What do you think the lens zoom range is on this bad boy?
Excellent now I can shoot planets!
    Touché!
Great now I gotta spend hours making one, thanks alot.
this fucking guy....
Bravo
Looks like my Canon. The thing is, I do not see the round mode select knob. Must be a nasty Nikon!

*shots fired*
    My dad is also a Canon man.

He says that he likes the cameras, but they really lock you into their ecosystem with the lenses.
        All camera makers do that. I had a bad experience with Nikon once back years ago. Too much green in the captured images. They probably fixed it by now, but I never got past all that wasted money. Canon has been good to me.
Forever best Dad Joke
This is excellent and very well done!
A thing of beauty
    I know
        will never fade away
            What you did to meeee,
There is an actual Canon mirrorless camera plonked into an [orbiting satellite](https://www.dpreview.com/news/4114182590/explore-earth-from-the-canon-ce-sat-1-satellite-and-its-onboard-canon-5d-mark-iii).
You good sir, are a legend
Be careful where you pee.
This is beautiful.
Haha, alright, that's great.
Hahahahahahaaaa niiiice!
Could be used as orbital flash bang
You are a legend 👍🍺🍺🍺🍺🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
🤣🤣🤣🤣👏👏👏👏
Fuck 4K, we're catching you in 4Trillion
How did you get a floating base?
    Look up low orbit base on yt
That did make me chuckle :) good one, and nice work!
I sprayed Dr. Pepper out my nose the instant I saw this! Oh dear Euclid that hurt but I was still laughing.
Looks more like an orbital Nikon to me
    I was thinking more like a Sony Mirrorless lol
Thats not an orbital cannon. Thats an orbital Kodak.
    I was looking at an EOS 70D as I was making it.

But it *looks* like a Kodak because I was working with the tools I was given. :/
    It's actually a Canon.
Best pun ever🤣
Looks more like Orbital Zenit
    Yes. In my defense, I had limited tools to work with and no patience for a Blender session.
Bro Hello Games should add this as a joke ngl
Nice.
No, I wanted an Orbital Nikon.
    I did too, but the pun is no good.
Is this a Freighter or a base, and if the latter how did you position it so up high??
    There are a few videos out there that will show you techniques for building in low orbit. It's a bit trickier now with the new autosave system (most methods relied on using both auto and manual save points as a safety net, and that doesn't work so well anymore) but it's still doable.
A Rebel space station!
Shame. Shame on you. Shame on your companion.
We can build in space now ?
    No. But there are tricks to build in the air. Some are basically glitches...

But for simpletons like me... you can start building upwards until you reach the building height limit. When you reach the 'invisible ceiling', place a new base computer, and keep going up.
Rinse and repeat.
Once your head is high in the clouds. Start deleting the lower pieces... either one by one, or delete the entire base computer. Voila, you have a flying base.
        Thx
Aha holy shit this is awesome
Beautiful.

Not like that!
That's just legendary
Well I can tell you the [serial number](https://youtu.be/0bUzTZLaX7Q)

    Canon cannon
That is outstanding. Take a pic of a far off star system..... Then blast it to smithereens 🌟😂
Yeah, but more like orbital Sony...
If Canon made the James Webb telescope
Say cheeeeeeese!

...

Aw, you blinked.
    Where did they go!!!
This is a kick ass space station right there!!!!
Lol, well done! I'm in the minority that actually wants orbital Nikons, but that's just a personal preference.
    Nah, Polaroid or minolta all the way XD
caught in 962k
Looks like my old t70.
    It actually has decals that say "70" on the left grip, but they didn't come through in the screenshot.
    With the 200mm zoom lens.
I see what you did there.....
This is amazing
Goddamn this is hilarious!!! Congrats, OP. You win the internet for today.
And yet somehow it's only got a Micro 4/3rds sensor.
I hate you so much.

\*upvotes*
    I hate myself, too. Just a little. But sacrifices must be made for the cause.
I like what ya did there 😂
Heck yeah!
Touché, traveller.
I think the only thing that could make this better is if the flash actually shit some highlander at the surface if the planet
    You can stop the puns. We get the picture...
Haha that's funny.
Shouldn't it be facing the planet?
LordNikon lives there.
    What? Your mom buy you a 'puter for Christmas?
There is no f*cking way...
What's the focal length and aperture of that lense
    I bet it rivals the Hubble.
Omg
Next a duplicate of Olympus Mons???

Or a Sony Pony......

Lol this is great! Thanks for sharing!
9000 hours of build time to make a pun.

This is the best gaming community. Grah.
Took me a bit to get the picture.
How the F you build a base that high?
    [deleted]
        Can you land on it?
            [deleted]
                Or you can do it on a low atmosphere planet.  If your jetpack is upgraded enough, you can fly upwards basically forever by doing it in little bursts.
    Normally by smoking weed
        *Nip nip buds
Looks like a Nikon to me
Do this one next!

Does that count as a r/technicallythetruth?
Anyway that camera looks sick.
Love it
It looks like a Nokia to me i want my money back.

Also i'm kinda surprised it took this long for someone to do a camera build so nice one.
    I have been sitting on this pun for a couple of weeks now, just sure someone would beat me to it. So I guess what we learned here is that I have less dignity than they do.
        hahaha its nms i think our dignity left when it came to naming planets childish and dumb names or building big dicks, i'm guilty of that one.

My base felt lonely ok.
    .... You mean Nikon?
        Oh bollocks you're right.
    oh god, not the unbreakable phone. Anything but THAT.
        Unfortunately their cameras could break which sucked for me given i spent £500 on it.
Not this one. I want the newer models that can shoot planets from far away.
This would be more appropriate. This game doesn't have anything that needs orbital artillery. Ground artillery is pointless.
    But what if me and the guys wanted to hold the line? We have entrenching tools but no artillery!
        What line? The idea of holding territory in NMS is pointless.
            Well the joke flew over your head like an exotic. It's a WH40K joke.
Wait there’s space station building now? Damn.
    Always has been
😂😂😂
Cannon. Not camera!
    All that time building and I left out an "n".
    It is a spy camera. Don’t ask whose window it is pointed at.
        UHHHHHHH
            “Ah, yes, the three breasted and beautiful sea ladies of New Bouncia!”
                *brrast flies off* *boing*
                    Huh. Maybe I should’ve warned him they are also giants that are cannibalistic of men (and even women) from outside species. Maybe, just maybe I should have given some kind of warning.
Looks like a T70.
Bwhahahaha...good job!
That is fine work.
10/10 no notes
Normally dad jokes fall flat for me. This one is out of this world!

Very good! lol!
Wait how did you build in space like that
    It's not really in space, just high off the ground :)
        Oh ok
    There are a few videos on YouTube that show you how to get a base computer up there. It's trickier now with the new continual autosave (most techniques used a combination of auto and manual saves as a safety net), but it can still be done if you are careful.
    I make a platform with terrain manipulator create mode and erase it when I'm done!
I see this as the Ultimate Weapon in Space Balls 2: The Search for more Money!
Who is the photographer, the one who photographs? Or the one who photographs the photographer? 

Jokes aside, imagine rolling up on THAT in outer space
Brilliant. I hope this is the only orbital cannon we get. It'd be super cool to be exploring and run into this thing.
exactly what we wanted!
This is acceptable
🤘
Oh wow that is funny because you're vessel look like an actual canon dslr camera haha what a coimcidence. Ok now you have a great day bye keep making funny pitcures

That's no moon
I love this LMAO also awesome work I know that's not easy
This is awesome thank you
I see what you did there. Haha
Holy shit we can build in space now??
    [deleted]
        Oh dang
    Always could, just build towards the heavens and delete what's attached to the ground. Stacking & deleting prefabs
        That sounds awful. Awesome though
            Lol it's quicker than it might seem... Took me about 20-30 minutes the first time I tried and I reached about 200aus above the planet, which is definitely high enough to look like it's in orbit, or at least floating in the sky...

Oh dude, is that a Kodak Class? 😜
Amazing how far this game has come from its disastrous launch full of lies and empty promises that permanently turned off 90% of players from ever playing it again. Kudos to this community for keeping this dead-on-arrival game alive!
    What a fucked up compliment lol
        Hey at least the NMS playerbase is cool enough to take comments like this in stride and keep the thread(s) going.

Compare with that... other big-name game that came out a few years ago, where comments like this get you burned from the surface of the sub- even with the... limited improvement-based efforts.
            ever heard of a game called overwatch 2
        Wait I thought this was r/cyberpunk2077
    I bought it knowing i was going to wait for 2 years before playing
I'm a Nikon man, myself, but I'd give that shutter a click.
Wait did I miss something? I haven't played in a while we're orbital cannons added recently?
    No, it's been the feature request du jour for the memes.
    no, it’s just what the sub wants, and op is playing a joke on it
    It’s a wild thing, a group wants it so bad. So it’s being meme’d
        Lololol

You can take so many photographs with that thing
It’s beautiful.

That's just too funny 🤣 Good job

BTW I upvoted and it's not showing

Welp, A for effort!
I wAnT aN oRbItAl CaNon uueeemmm, them they make it and someone explodes your home planet and you lose everything there, yeah big smart idea, they wouldn't get rage messages everyday naah trust, ppl blowing up planets with good resourcers cause they're petty wouldn't happen at all either...stupidest idea ever
    Tbf there's a large difference between an orbital friendship cannon and the freaking Death Star.

It'd be fun to call in a strike on a sentinel outpost, ngl.

However, I feel the game is better off without them.
        Yeah an op af orbital laser with a huuuuge CD would be great, but ppl want to blow up planets lol and that is the worst idea
            Yup, although I'd like to find those detonated planets in a state less than whole.
Looks like a camera with a long lense

i love this😂just curious though op, is this getting massed downvoted? i see no upvotes on it
    It's cuz people seriously think it's ruining the game LMFAO "let the devs decide features 🥴"
        ah i see. i wasn’t sure it reddit was glitching or not. honestly i don’t understand why the community is getting so heated with the feature, i don’t ever see it being implemented so they’re stressing over nothing imo
            Because much like r/Overlord people around here take things super seriously sometimes.  I can't understand why people take it so God damn seriously.
looks like  camera
    Precisely.

        Make sense
No. Only one person said that.
Orbital Canon? More like orbital camera, amirite?!

    Yes, a Canon, a brand of camera
    Yes. Like a Canon
We said canon not camera
    Canon is a company that makes cameras, the weapon type is spelled cannon
    Spelling is important.
    Let me introduce you to the concept of a ‘dad joke’. It’s related to ‘sarcasm’ and ‘irony’ (and that’s not something to do with iron). Also known as ‘pun’ or ‘play on words’ 😂
        I thought I was playing along
            Probably. But i’m a sarcastic bastard
    No we said Q Anon not cannon
        I ment to say that, darn auto correct
That's a photo camera dude
    That's a camera from the company with the name cannon. 
Pretty genius in my eyes🤣
        Canon*, ftfy
            I will learn the name properly when they learn my name back🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
That is very cool :)
Wait, what are you tryin to take a photo on the pic...?
I'm new... How did you manage this? Mods?
    There are a couple of videos on how to do it, though it's gotten trickier with continual autosave.
    You can get bases up real high by moving your base computer, the higher you go the higher you can build
        i tried this and i could only get so high. I couldnt get into space.
            I think it also involves building more base terminals
                Looks more like the: jump from frigate and place minotaur base in noclip mode
Need.
Amazing :)
Wow, nice work.
Drol very very drol . I salute you
You should work with that one Redditor that makes the animated displays (somehow with beatbyte machines?) to get that back display to use a simple animation. That would be amazing.
    Oh, man, that would be cool. I dunno if I have it in me, but...
genius
…How? Lmao
    G l i t c h e s
Just wow!
Took me a second to get it I’m curious how you got it into orbit
That’s not a gun
🤣🤣🤣 love it
Did you just build up and delete the stuff under it? I had thought about this but never ended up trying it.
    While you can do that, you end up with the base computer on the ground and the base 1000u in the air which is inconvenient. What you do is start that way, and then establish a second base computer once you get more than 1000u above the first. There are videos that step you through it.
        I'll have to check that out. This is actually sick.
sorry if i'm intireley missing the joke, but that looks like a camera? sorry, i reallly dont get it. can someone explain please? i wanna laugh too:(
    Canon is a brand of camera.
        Oh of course, how'd i forget? 😅😂

    I don’t know about you guys but I’m going there after work. I want a picture on top of that. If I ever have children I’ll definitely show it to them as a learning aid 🤣🤣🤣🤣
        These are the kinds of parenting skills society is sorely lacking.
Kanon
Not canon to the story like GT in DragonBall!
Same, but it took me seeing your comment to realise as well! Got one up on me at least.
Me too… me too
My work here is finished.
Nice, dude. Nice.
How the photo of the worlds first camera was taken?
    With the world's second camera?
no offense but this is the most reddit comment ive ever seen
    I’m high AF right now. I’m sure I’ll read this later and cringe.
You mean photo bombed
… but not the one this subreddit deserves
    Indeed
PvP sweats looking for instant gratification /s
Dammit, you beat me to it!
To revive the Empire
    To destroy Alderaan
I'm not old. You're old
Not one but 3!
No, no it was not
Anything within its visual range.
Glyphs in the photo. You can visit.

There's nothing inside. I do have a viewing platform close by, though, which is where the teleporter at the station will take you.
    I will visit soon. Saw the glyphs earlier. Just wondered what was inside. Would be a such a cool home base, especially with a landing pad "hidden" behind that rear screen and a takeoff vector going through the lens. 

Great concept 👌
What do you think the lens zoom range is on this bad boy?
Touché!
My dad is also a Canon man.

He says that he likes the cameras, but they really lock you into their ecosystem with the lenses.
    All camera makers do that. I had a bad experience with Nikon once back years ago. Too much green in the captured images. They probably fixed it by now, but I never got past all that wasted money. Canon has been good to me.
I know
    will never fade away
        What you did to meeee,
Look up low orbit base on yt
I was thinking more like a Sony Mirrorless lol
I was looking at an EOS 70D as I was making it.

But it *looks* like a Kodak because I was working with the tools I was given. :/
It's actually a Canon.
Yes. In my defense, I had limited tools to work with and no patience for a Blender session.
I did too, but the pun is no good.
There are a few videos out there that will show you techniques for building in low orbit. It's a bit trickier now with the new autosave system (most methods relied on using both auto and manual save points as a safety net, and that doesn't work so well anymore) but it's still doable.
No. But there are tricks to build in the air. Some are basically glitches...

But for simpletons like me... you can start building upwards until you reach the building height limit. When you reach the 'invisible ceiling', place a new base computer, and keep going up.
Rinse and repeat.
Once your head is high in the clouds. Start deleting the lower pieces... either one by one, or delete the entire base computer. Voila, you have a flying base.
    Thx
Canon cannon
Where did they go!!!
Nah, Polaroid or minolta all the way XD
It actually has decals that say "70" on the left grip, but they didn't come through in the screenshot.
With the 200mm zoom lens.
I hate myself, too. Just a little. But sacrifices must be made for the cause.
You can stop the puns. We get the picture...
What? Your mom buy you a 'puter for Christmas?
I bet it rivals the Hubble.
[deleted]
    Can you land on it?
        [deleted]
            Or you can do it on a low atmosphere planet.  If your jetpack is upgraded enough, you can fly upwards basically forever by doing it in little bursts.
Normally by smoking weed
    *Nip nip buds
I have been sitting on this pun for a couple of weeks now, just sure someone would beat me to it. So I guess what we learned here is that I have less dignity than they do.
    hahaha its nms i think our dignity left when it came to naming planets childish and dumb names or building big dicks, i'm guilty of that one.

My base felt lonely ok.
.... You mean Nikon?
    Oh bollocks you're right.
oh god, not the unbreakable phone. Anything but THAT.
    Unfortunately their cameras could break which sucked for me given i spent £500 on it.
But what if me and the guys wanted to hold the line? We have entrenching tools but no artillery!
    What line? The idea of holding territory in NMS is pointless.
        Well the joke flew over your head like an exotic. It's a WH40K joke.
Always has been
All that time building and I left out an "n".
It is a spy camera. Don’t ask whose window it is pointed at.
    UHHHHHHH
        “Ah, yes, the three breasted and beautiful sea ladies of New Bouncia!”
            *brrast flies off* *boing*
                Huh. Maybe I should’ve warned him they are also giants that are cannibalistic of men (and even women) from outside species. Maybe, just maybe I should have given some kind of warning.
It's not really in space, just high off the ground :)
    Oh ok
There are a few videos on YouTube that show you how to get a base computer up there. It's trickier now with the new continual autosave (most techniques used a combination of auto and manual saves as a safety net), but it can still be done if you are careful.
I make a platform with terrain manipulator create mode and erase it when I'm done!
[deleted]
    Oh dang
Always could, just build towards the heavens and delete what's attached to the ground. Stacking & deleting prefabs
    That sounds awful. Awesome though
        Lol it's quicker than it might seem... Took me about 20-30 minutes the first time I tried and I reached about 200aus above the planet, which is definitely high enough to look like it's in orbit, or at least floating in the sky...
[Spaaaccce](https://nmsspot.com/2020/07/05/tiny-home-base-vi-floating-high-above-a-crowned-moon/)
What a fucked up compliment lol
    Hey at least the NMS playerbase is cool enough to take comments like this in stride and keep the thread(s) going.

Compare with that... other big-name game that came out a few years ago, where comments like this get you burned from the surface of the sub- even with the... limited improvement-based efforts.
        ever heard of a game called overwatch 2
    Wait I thought this was r/cyberpunk2077
I bought it knowing i was going to wait for 2 years before playing
No, it's been the feature request du jour for the memes.
no, it’s just what the sub wants, and op is playing a joke on it
It’s a wild thing, a group wants it so bad. So it’s being meme’d
    Lololol
Tbf there's a large difference between an orbital friendship cannon and the freaking Death Star.

It'd be fun to call in a strike on a sentinel outpost, ngl.

However, I feel the game is better off without them.
    Yeah an op af orbital laser with a huuuuge CD would be great, but ppl want to blow up planets lol and that is the worst idea
        Yup, although I'd like to find those detonated planets in a state less than whole.
/r/woooosh
    U used that wrong
        r/confidentlyincorrect
        Doible whoosh
It's cuz people seriously think it's ruining the game LMFAO "let the devs decide features 🥴"
    ah i see. i wasn’t sure it reddit was glitching or not. honestly i don’t understand why the community is getting so heated with the feature, i don’t ever see it being implemented so they’re stressing over nothing imo
        Because much like r/Overlord people around here take things super seriously sometimes.  I can't understand why people take it so God damn seriously.
Precisely.
    A Cannon Camera in Orbit, hahahaha
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_A-1
The pun is that Canon is a brand of camera
r/woosh is waiting for you my friend
    Double woosh. It was you who didn't get the joke lol. It's a Star Wars reference for God's sake.
        Fuck
Not sure if it's a wooosh. But OP means to pun Canon cameras here.
    Make sense

Canon brand
    Ooooh
        I second that
[removed]
    I'd be ok with that, I would absolutely LOVE a mining freighter for your fleet so you can call it down to mine deposits. I find the terrain gun too tedious
Camera, made by Canon
r/whoosh ? 

It's a *Canon* as the brand?
    Looks like a camera, I know what it is,
Was all this really necessary? You can't just HaHa and move on like someone with a level head?
Yes, a Canon, a brand of camera
Yes. Like a Canon
Canon is a company that makes cameras, the weapon type is spelled cannon
Spelling is important.
Let me introduce you to the concept of a ‘dad joke’. It’s related to ‘sarcasm’ and ‘irony’ (and that’s not something to do with iron). Also known as ‘pun’ or ‘play on words’ 😂
    I thought I was playing along
        Probably. But i’m a sarcastic bastard
No we said Q Anon not cannon
    I ment to say that, darn auto correct
That's a camera from the company with the name cannon. 
Pretty genius in my eyes🤣
    Canon*, ftfy
        I will learn the name properly when they learn my name back🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
There are a couple of videos on how to do it, though it's gotten trickier with continual autosave.
You can get bases up real high by moving your base computer, the higher you go the higher you can build
    i tried this and i could only get so high. I couldnt get into space.
        I think it also involves building more base terminals
            Looks more like the: jump from frigate and place minotaur base in noclip mode
Oh, man, that would be cool. I dunno if I have it in me, but...
G l i t c h e s
While you can do that, you end up with the base computer on the ground and the base 1000u in the air which is inconvenient. What you do is start that way, and then establish a second base computer once you get more than 1000u above the first. There are videos that step you through it.
    I'll have to check that out. This is actually sick.
Canon is a brand of camera.
    Oh of course, how'd i forget? 😅😂
Get out!
Jesus christ 🤦🏻‍♂️🤣
Number One. Ready the Canon. I have Borg optics to blind.
I shutter to think of the devastation this Canon could cause.
Don't let it stop the dad jokes .

I dont
The world needs to watch out when/if you reach your full potential.
