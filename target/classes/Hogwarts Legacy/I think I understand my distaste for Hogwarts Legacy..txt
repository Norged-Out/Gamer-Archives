[[I think I understand my distaste for Hogwarts Legacy.]]


I think I finally figured out why I struggle to enjoy this game so much. 

And I enjoy many aspects of it. I loved the open world and exploring the castle and Hogsmeade. I loved flying, the puzzles, the story (at first), and I LOVED the vivariums. I spent hours just playing and watching the animals play. 

Now, I enjoy puzzles and open world, but the story is what gets me. I‚Äôm a story gamer: Skyrim, Mass Effect, Final Fantasy, etc. But this game has a VERY linear storyline. And after wondering if it was the story that I had issues with, I realized something. It‚Äôs not the story I really have an issue with.

There are no consequences!!! I can treat Natty, Poppy, Sebastian, Amir, Professor Fig, basically anyone I meet as horribly as I can. They‚Äôll still support me and be my best friend. There are no consequences for curfew, skipping classes, let alone the Unforgivable Curses. 

And I think that‚Äôs the main issue of the game.

I agree, this game really needed a morality system
    Like in fable. 

That's my fav game and I see so many similarities between the 2 but it'd be nice if it really dove into the morality meter
        It would have been so cool! Imagine the different play throughs I'd love to replay it
        I never understood fable's attempt at morality. I can be as mean as I want and make a boatload of money over charging tenants, and as a result I get cool horns? I did all the bad stuff in every playthrough and it largely made the game easier. Yeah some people didn't like me, but by being bad I became op so fast that it didn't matter.
            Realizing that apparently im really weird. Lol

I struggle to be bad in the games. I kept trying to get 100% in fable but could never swing it. 

Yes it's easier I agree as I assume it'll be in HP learning the curses but it's such a role play mode for me to be that bad so I find it interesting.
                You're the type of person who actually pays the prostitutes in GTA lol ü§£. All love though. Whatever playstyle works for you
    Yep, with certain talents gated by morality.
Eg you can petrify low health enemies without stealth if good, but only get the chain avada if youre truly evil.

        I never said specific rewards should be given based on your choices, just the way people see and treat you

I don't think a character should *have* to be evil to use dark magic, what if they're just a mischievous Weasley type? I just think the way NPCs treat you and your options for dialog should be changed based on how many good or bad decisions you've made

I wouldn't want to see it affect actual gameplay or abilities, just give the players the ability to role play their characters.
    Isn't it confirmed there was going to be one but they didn't have time to implement it?
Have you played Red Dead Redemption 2? I wish there was a morality system similar to that game.
    The issue is that Arthur is a grown man in a situation where it makes sense for his character to swing either way.

In this game you‚Äôre a student and the main story needs access to hogwarts.¬†
        How would implementing a morality system effect that? It would give the dialogue options and choices made by the character have consequences.
            Because the consequences would be breaking the gameplay.

What are you gonna do with unforgivable curses?

Azkhaban? Get expelled from school? Neither would work.

It would also break the main storyline. The whole point is to go through a series of tests to ensure that the wielder of this ancient magic is strong enough and selfless enough to not use it for evil - how are you gonna convince anyone to keep helping and aiding a student who throws unforgivable curses left and right?
                I think you‚Äôre pointing out an additional flaw of the game on top of morality. They could‚Äôve had morality and they shouldn‚Äôt have had the unforgivables. As a gamer I loved it but for the story it was BONKERS decision.
                    They should block unforgivables in front of other student or professors. Like they did with the spells used to create object outside the room of requirement.

You can only use them when with sebastian or against dark art wizards, ashwinders and so on when no one else is around. 
It feels so wrong going around saving magical creatures with Poppy and then use the killing curse against doggos or spiders.
                        My headcannon for this is that the unforgivable curses are illegal to use against WIZARDS. not creatures.

Killing spiders with AK is perfectly legal (fake Moody did it in a class with no repercussions).
                            Poachers are creatures, mumbling quietly
                    I think the unforgivables are a weird concept. Murder is murder no matter what spell you use. It's like banning knives just because they can be used to harm others. Avada could've been used as an euthanasia tool, because there's no pain involved
                        Are you forgetting the part that with unforgivables you really REALLY have to want/mean it? Aka you can't just nilly willy cast Crucio or AK. You literally have to be evil or blinded by a certain emotion to be able to cast them
                            I also think AK was a forbidden curse because it was the curse needed to make a Horcrux. Like you can‚Äôt just stun someone and they fall of their broom and then you can make a horcrux, you have to use Avada Kedavra in order to make a horcrux and that‚Äôs why I think it was a forbidden curse too.
                        Classic Slytherin
                    I loved it too, and it was probably a higher priority and a big selling point to include for the gameplay, which probably meant scrapping any morality mechanics or just not implementing them at all. 

I dont know what I wouldve prefered to be honest. Morality mechanics over unforgivables?
                        I think morality would have been better, but then the unforgivables falls directly into that as pure evil so they should stay.

It's the consequences that would be hard to add for it, like having aurors and dementors randomly attack you to make the game more difficult when you're evil . Are teachers then mad at you, do they stop helping ? Do NPCs get involved? Shops stop serving you?   

Any good mechanics that I can think of just break the whole idea of having a linear story line.  The story needs to be more dynamic and change with your alignment to even make it work... which would  be difficult to achieve well. They didn't even bother to add quidditch, giving up half way through, so I think this would be asking too much of them.
                        Coding an entire morality system vs adding curses is Apple and oranges, the two probably didn‚Äôt affect those decisions during dev
                it dosent totally make sense for the story but my little idea just something i think is cool would be yeah you do go to askaban and while your there you befriend another prisoner or something and learn expecto patronum and get to escape
                    u do realise their wands get taken off the witch/wizard when theyre put in azkaban?üíÄ
                I don't think being a student necessarily prevents a morality system, especially considering morality is such a big theme in the book series. Random (or scripted) events, like someone bullying someone in a hallway could provide a way for MC to intervene and gain honour or even house points, and choosing to encourage the bullies will make you loose honour or house points. Getting caught while sneaking around after curfew, messing up a classroom by casting spells on the intractable book stacks, antagonising students and teachers, or picking the mean dialogue option causes you to loose honour and house points. 

Using the unforgivable curses should have aurors or dementors come looking for you in the Highlands. It can be a situation where the ministry knows someone has used them (through the trace or something?) but doesn't really know who. If you get caught without disguise in the Highlands, then game over. Moreover, there can be other consequences, e.g. if you use too much unforgivable you won't be able to cast a patronus, so you need to somehow learn occlumency to avoid confrontation with dementors. Or maybe the ministry is searching for you even if you don't use AK because of your ancient magic ability, but the amount of aurors and dementors spawning will increase based on your use of those spells. I think this is doable in a sequel.
            Immagine for a second that all the ‚Äúbad choices‚Äù introduce you to a third party (I don‚Äôt know dark wizzards that likely Sebastian want to defeat the concept of pain and death) and as a result Professor Fig will fight you to stop you from using the ancient magic for the wrong reason. That would change everything.
Even if there‚Äôs an Azkaban prison they have to capture you first which means some aurors will try to chase you around the map‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know but there was so much potential for a morality system in this game.
            [deleted]
                That‚Äôs why I said choices as well.
                    What are the consequences of the choices if the consequences isn‚Äôt expelled from hogwarts and that‚Äôs the end of the game¬†¬†

¬†Edit: I can‚Äôt reply to the below so I‚Äôll leave it here.¬†

¬†What are you needed for in which you can‚Äôt be expelled? Nobody knows hat you‚Äôre doing besides Fig and Natty, Poppy, and Sebastian if you tell them. If you do tell them but you want to be an asshole, you‚Äôre not needed for anything they have going on, because they‚Äôre not part of the main story and there‚Äôs no reason you need to be involved at all. Their storyline can simlly end and that‚Äôs that. Which isn‚Äôt an actual consequence.¬†

You already do have to fight everything yourself. So that‚Äôs not a consequence my anything because you already do.

Like, none of what you said works for the game at all
                        I mean, that‚Äôs a pretty unimaginative view. You could not be expelled because they know they need you, but everyone dislikes you and stops working with you. And you have to fight everything by yourself, certain storylines dry up, etc., maybe you make a side deal with the dark ones for some extra cash.
        Was Tom Riddle a grown man when he was casting unforgivables and making horcruxes?
            Yes‚Ä¶¬† ¬†In hogwarts Tom Riddle couldn‚Äôt do much of anything because of dumbledore.¬†The most he was doing was the chamber of secrets which he blamed on hagrid. (Now that I think about it, I forgot how moaning mertle died. I think it was the basalisk but I could be wrong and it was Voldemort who did it)

¬†He found out about the Horcruxes later in life and then made them.¬†
                It was the basilisk. She was crying in the toilet, heard something and open the door to the basilisk.
                Created the diary in his 5th year at Hogwarts
                    Detail; he used the death of Moaning Myrtle to make the diary in his 5th year. He killed his father a year later to make the ring Horcrux, so that‚Äôs two murders/Horcruxes before he‚Äôs even left school
                    I don‚Äôt remember the books ever giving dates as to when they were created. The only one was Harry
                        The portion of his soul within the diary that comes out is a child, and I think he kills his father during the events in the Pensieve in HBP, Dumbledore mentions that he was underage. The date of the murder is given as 1943, when he would have been 16 and still at school. That was also confirmed to be his second Horcrux
    Unpopular opinion: RDR2's honor mechanic fell flat on its face. I shot everyone in Valentine after trying to help a prostitute dispose of a corpse, but a few days of doing chores around camp and Arthur's back to being the goodest of boys.
Yes, I think that's a real shame too.

A morale system was even in the works, but the devs had to release the game a year in advance and had to cut a lot or unfortunately didn't get a lot of things done, including the morale system.

The game sped up - especially towards the end.
    Ah that makes sense.
    Too focused on making the open world too big. I almost hating open worlds nowadays
        I noticed that too, when I started playing. They expanded the world too much, and didn't have enough content to fill it. Hence the 50 different collecta-thons.

It's not why I quit after 8 hours, but it didn't help the game.
That was my problem with the game as well. You felt less like a student and more like a amateur Auror.
    Hogwarts: Jump Street
        Amazing üòÇüòÇ
    This! I don‚Äôt quite understand how a 15 year old is able to go toe-to-toe with fully adult/fully trained witches and wizards.¬†

In the Harry Potter books it‚Äôs understood that Harry ‚Äúlucks out‚Äù to a certain extent AND he usually gets help during his major fights.¬†

Also don‚Äôt quite understand how the MC of Hogwarts legacy is allowed to leave the castle at all hours of the day and night and never seems to do any schoolwork. Idk.¬†
        This is so annoying,  crossed wands duels felt more challenging than the grown ups who most of them didn't had prot√©g√© mastery and knew like 2 or 3 spells while the students could use several and were constantly protegoed
        Not only a 15 year old, a 15 year old in his/her 1st year of magical education. The ancient magic the mc controls must be more powerful than most wizards are able to defend against
Unfortunately there is no depth to the story. It starts off well enough but falls flat quickly. 

The trials do net test the morality of our character. 

Ancient magic is just a bigf to our spells and doesn't do anything else of substance.

The villains where one dimensional at best. 



I truly wish that the main storyline was of a quality skin to Sebastian's side quest.
    Sebastian‚Äôs story 100% should have been the main storyline.¬†
        It mirrors Isidora's story so well that I have to believe they were planning on tying the 2 storylines together, but dropped it for some reason. Imagine if it was mandatory to see through his quest for power to the very end before having that conversation about what to do with the repository. Knowing the protagonist has Sebastian's fate fresh in their mind while going into that discussion would add so much more depth to their choice.
            I definitely think they planned on this, as they set it up with Isidora‚Äôs painting and Seb watching the memory of her taking pain with MC. I was 100% expecting it to tie in but it didn‚Äôt.
Exploring was terrible in my opinion. The castle looked fantastic, but it was like walking through a hogwarts museum. After a few hours it lost its appeal without interactivity

The open world was terrible. Way too big, repetive burrows, nothing rewarding about exploring.. the Forrest was so underwhelming. Most importantly it felt like any other open world set in some historical setting. It really lost the Harry Potter identity

The best thing in this game was the combat.. even if it did get easy, it stayed fun throughout the game
    Spot on comment here. The castle is just a museum with a bunch of references to the books, and yes the open world is too big and too empty and the forest is lacking. I wish it was more focused on classes and a story that affected the school and the other students more.
It needed better, more developed companions from each House, too! Looking at my favorite RPGs - Baldur's Gate 3, Greedfall, Mass Effect - and even ones I've enjoyed like Outer Worlds - there are great companions with their own backstories, banter, and large questlines. Sebastian and Ominis, and to a lesser extent Poppy and Natty, are the only real companions, and they aren't developed, you can't put them in a big party and have them banter, there's no consequences to your actions with them. This game needed the opportunity to assemble your own Golden Trio, ideally with at least 1-2 companions from each House. That would have opened the game up to a billion different playthroughs.

Instead, I have less than 15 hours in, and I keep feeling like I love the castle and the clothing but am unimpressed by the rest of it. I'd rather have an RPG that was The Sims - Hogwarts, being an average student. Or something with more character development for the people around us. I really wanted to love this, but I can't get into it despite knowing the lore and loving the ability to wander the world. 

Meanwhile, despite knowing nothing about Forgotten Realms, I'm 80+ hours into BG3 and planning my next 2-3 games, because I want to explore different outcomes and possibilities, along with different paths for my companions. Hogwarts Legacy is AAA and doesn't feel like it has the replayability with branching paths/choices mattering - not just of a GotY AAA title like BG3, but even a straight-up AA title like Greedfall.
My main issue is that the storyline is linear. Even without a morality system, it could have different choices resulting in different actions. The only choice is your house which is a different mission. 

I wish you could choose to ignore the Guardians. Maybe take an advanced class. Be caught by the librarian in the Restricted section and banned from the library. Make friends with a student and show a hidden area and each student gives you a different area. 

No matter what you do, the story is always the same.
    I totally agree with you, in fact there was a point when I told Sebastian's uncle that I agreed with him and condemned Sebastian, only for him to answer exactly the same way as if I'd said the opposite and we ended up fighting anyways. It almost felt like a bug with how illogical it was! There were a couple more instances like this one in the game where my answers didn't matter at all.
I couldn‚Äôt agree more. I enjoy the game but the no consequence thing makes it fall a little flat at times
Why was it released early? I‚Äôm really enjoying it but I would like a morality system when playing the rest of the houses to mix it up, the missions and puzzles are abit samey and the story is properly the most boring bit of the game
    It was already being developed for like 5 years, I think the investors just had enough and told them to shove it out the door. It really shows in the second half of the game.
        Just to show that just because someone has money doesn‚Äôt mean they are smart. 

A fully polished gem would‚Äôve been significantly better than the current release.
            Would 6 years instead of 5 years development (+20% development costs) have resulted in more than 20% more sales though? I dislike their decision as well, but financially speaking I understand it. Although you also have to wonder how this impacts the sales of a sequel (how many disappointed fans won't be buying a sequel because of this?)
                It‚Äôs HP it‚Äôll sell
                    Yeah, probably
                Oh they'll buy it
            It's the best selling game of 2023
                Which it would‚Äôve been the best selling game of 2024 if they had fully polished it.
                It sold on the HP name, not its gameplay.

BG3 sold some on the D&D or BG name(me, I was gonna buy it regardless just because of the first two), but then it sold more when people started praising the writing, characters, gameplay, choices, and options.

Hogwarts Legacy got no praise for the actual content of the game.
This is probably the biggest issue this game has in regard to replayability. I played the game on release and it took me probably about 30 hours to get through the main story and I haven‚Äôt felt the slightest urge to pick it up again. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a bad game or anything, but after the first 10 hours of play time where you‚Äôre going to classes and exploring the castle the rest of the game is hollow.

In other popular RPGs like this you can try to play the game in a different way each and every playthrough and it can still feel fresh - like being a Heavy Armor archer user in the Elder Scrolls but your next playthrough you can be a stealthy assassin and the game totally allows for that, but most importantly because the choices you make in the game directly affect certain outcomes. Playing the game a different way gives you a hugely different experience. 

The roleplay elements and the immersion is completely lost here because nothing you do in the game affects anything. I can constantly choose the ‚Äúevil‚Äù or ‚Äúbad‚Äù response in the dialogue options but that doesn‚Äôt change how anyone interacts with you or as you said freely spam the killing curse on whoever and there isn‚Äôt any repercussions. Once you get out of Hogwarts and the areas around Hogsmeade the world just feels so mundane and empty. It looks pretty, but it‚Äôs all the same caves and dungeons with loot that nobody cares about with too many monotone and repetitive tasks.
    You only have one set of tools in this game and they made it so that all of them are required at some point.

There is no possible variety.
I remember while playing the game, I had the sudden realization that I might be more evil than the goblins I'm fighting.
I‚Äôm the opposite. I don‚Äôt want to worry about consequences with every game( I also don‚Äôt ever choose to be abusive or mean to NPCs either, so there is that). I just want to play the game and have fun. 

I feel like there are so many games where consequences for actions are a part of the system of storytelling and that‚Äôs great, but I was grateful for Legacy didn‚Äôt. There needs to be space for both types of games. 

I loved Legacy for the fact that it was just a relaxing, magical good time. It was exactly what I wanted and why I got the platinum for it. I think a lot of it is that in many ways I tell stories for a living and sometimes when I sit down to play a game I just want someone to tell me a story for a change. I want to relax and enjoy the ride. Not with every game, but some games.  I would hate if Legacy changed that aspect as I would love to depend on it for being a consistent series where I can just relax. When I want consequences I can play BG3 or Disco Elysium where it is centered around those ideas and does a really good job at it.
    Very much agree. I liked the linearity of the story coupled with the gorgeous exploration, puzzles, atmosphere, action, and adventure. ¬†

It‚Äôs of course fun to think about some large scale RPG interwoven multi path story with morality but I think that often comes with a cost. ¬†It‚Äôs cumbersome even when done well.
    Without consequences to choices, either penalty or benefit, did you even make a choice?

Don't fall for 'illusion of choice' game design.
        I think this is a good point. There is nothing wrong with stories with no choices, but if that's the case then they should go for that instead of making the players "choose" options that don't have much of an impact. There were admittedly some choices that had some impacts, like the Ominis and Sea questline, but in most cases where you got an option you didn't make a difference to anything.
See, I loved it. I tried RD2 and was lost on ‚Äúnow what do I do?‚Äù I liked being told ‚Äúhere is the next step‚Äù.
It was an attempt at letting you do whatever you want while keeping the world super stale and ‚Äúhappy‚Äù when in reality the world of HP in the books is actually a very very dark one in many aspects. 

I‚Äôve seen this happen to too many of my fav IPs as they continue to be the ‚Äúalways a happy ending‚Äù type game even though the 2023 GOTY was one in which you could end the game at very many points by making the wrong choice
    Yeah, this game appeals to the ones that watched the first movie or two and that's it.
I would genuinely delete my near-100% character, remake her, and likely make completely different choices the second time around if they introduce a karmic system in the future
Mentions "skyrim" as a "story gamer".
Plot and impact matters about as much in HL as it does in rim.

But both would be better with actual consequence.
    It matters more in Skyrim. You at least had the option to be Imperial or Stormcloak, even if they ended up in the same place.

This game forces you do everything, by gating story behind collectathon bullshit.
        Does it though?
I played a "complete only the main quest" run and do you know what level you need to be to complete the final quest?
22.
Know what level I was at the point having achievely avoided most challenges? Only collecting every spell (aside for unforgiveables).

21, and I reached 22 almost immediately afterwards.

The game does not force you to do the side stuff, or the merlin trials, or the ancient magic upgrade puzzles. Not for the main story.
            I logged 8.1 hours into the game, then uninstalled.

No Man's Sky had deeper content at launch than this game does now.
                Lol, hello hyperbole
Could not agree more it‚Äôs my only major issue like I want CONSEQUENCES for my ACTIONS
    Besides ‚ÄúI cant believe she didn‚Äôt tell me the answer when I showed it to her!‚Äù Because honestly I felt better about my decision every time a student got upset lol
YES! And not being able to interact with objects or people around Hogwarts removes the immersive experience they tried to create. The entire game just feels so‚Ä¶. lonely.
I enjoyed it without worrying about each dialogue choice, looking up guides, and save scumming. Was just a nice trip into a world I could only dream of as a kid.   

We are beyond blessed with so many different avenues to consume favorite IPs through games, movies, shows, etc. I just enjoy the ride instead of critiquing everything.
It doesn't even need a morality system, just literally anything. Have characters not want to interact (including quest givers) until you bribe them with money or specific items if you piss them off too much. Literally just that. 
Or increase the number of dark wizards around if you curse more. 

The bare minimum of additional gameplay hurdles based on doing things the player EXPECTS to be punished for. That's all we're asking for.

Shit, just have the fast travel statues say mean things, with the same frequency of how often she talked before the first major patch. That'll get me to be terrified to break rules in a heartbeat.
    Oooh! I like the idea of increasing the dark wizards per curse.
Yeh this game is good. It scratched an itch for me. The problem is, it COULD have been so much better. So many missed opportunities.
Meh, for me the no consequences is not a bug it's a feature. If they do implement a morality system, they better have an on/off switch in the settings. That eay everyone can play how they want ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
    It makes it feel like a game from yesteryear, where you can go in people's houses, break their stuff and dig in their trash with no consequences. I rather liked it.
        It's funny you say that, because of a lot of those games had consequences for doing shit like that. Even Zelda had the chicken army consequence of hitting chickens too many times.
There are consequences. I burned ferdinands painting, not realizing that poppy would give me shit about it every time I saw her. She doesnt say, "hey rescuing the snidget s was really fun" or "remember when that dragon nearly killed us twice?". No, all she says to me is that I had no right to burn his frame. And it hurts, because she is supposed to be the MC's girlfriend, and now she wont even share a butrer beer with me
We all kinda agree Bully but Hogwarts is our ideal HL2‚Ä¶ So it‚Äôs safe to say you‚Äôre not alone!!
I‚Äôm not sure what consequence you would want from Fig, Natty, Sebastian, and Poppy considering they‚Äôre important to the main quest. And I‚Äôm using important loosely.¬†¬†

¬†As for skipping classes, you don‚Äôt actually have classes to skip. So that doesn‚Äôt work. Not even in persona do you have a whole class schedule, and it would feel redundant to have a cutscene in class every single time. I guess for this you mean something like having a time limit to complete the assignments and then you have to go to class the very next day, and if you skip, then you simply cannot learn the spells and there‚Äôs no way to learn them.

As for curfew, I wish the prefects matters more if you‚Äôre sneaking around in the castle after curfew, but other than that, I don‚Äôt care to do everything in the morning, because that would get annoying real fast. I again, in persona the fact that you couldn‚Äôt go out at night was annoying.¬†

When it comes to a morality system, that one is interesting and I can‚Äôt really see it implemented in this game because you‚Äôre a student at hogwarts. There‚Äôs not really a situation I can see where the player isn‚Äôt immediately expelled and the game ends.

I do wish there was other RPG elements in the game, but I‚Äôm not that upset that there‚Äôs not a morality system¬†
I totally agree. I also would like consequences in terms of dying. After playing elden Ring where death is very punishing it's kinda lame where you can literally just retry the fight over and over with no cost
I'm just in the beginning (hour of 40) what I find hard to enjoy is also the enormous amount of NPC. The NPCs combined with no morality consequences, results in no-compassion with the world around you. It's just the storyline with many many many possibilities, but without any attachment to the impressive world. Therefore the game feels a bit "flat", it misses depth.
*Spoiler* I got to the room where you meet everyone in the pictures. Did the first trial. Screwed off and did a bunch of side quests. Game froze and I guess for some reason hadn't auto saved. Reload save, I'm at the entrance of the place where all the guys are in the pictures. Haven't touched the game since. Using vague language to not spoil too much.
I hated that and the whole 'predestined special character' trope. It's not anything established in lore, it's not even believable within the lore. It was just thrown in there for no reason other than they couldn't find any other way of adding certain mechanics in. 
Also, I hated the little copy/paste dungeons. 

Not to say I hated the game, because I really enjoyed it for the most part.
Although I did find it a bit funny that I was spamming Crucio and Imperio in the goblin fight in Feldcroft, and no one batted an eyelash. Meanwhile, when Sebastian used Imperio to save his sister's life, he got banished. I would be in some very deep crap if there was actually a morality system.
Dude I noticed exactly the same thing! I was bummed out because I tried to be nice to Lenora Everleigh thinking ‚Äúoh hey maybe a romance option‚Äù but nope! No lasting effect and no future story.
Yeah. We thought it was gonna  end a  epic RPG, but it's really a for the fans action adventure.
I get the criticism but...you mention Skyrim. Are there really any consequences there? You're not just allowed to join a syndicate, extort the weak, and become an edgy assassin who basically worships Satan...you're *expected* to. And there's no ramifications for this. At all.

Not that I'm defending HL here. I do wish there was more of a morality system beyond simply being a douchebag.
    In Skyrim, pissing off any guild got you banned until you paid a penalty in gold.

What happens in this game when you run around using Dark Arts in front of teachers or breaking into their personal rooms? Nothing beyond a comment or two. That's not a consequence; that is a pointed lack of consequence.
I enjoyed the game. Didn‚Äôt end up finishing it. My 6th grade daughter enjoyed flying around and casting spells for a while.
I was playing happily until I realized that I don‚Äôt have the energy to get enough field guides to 100% the game. 

If the field guides weren‚Äôt an issue, I‚Äôd have done it by now. Though I still wish I‚Äôd have the energy for all the quests and exploration tasks
Is it a main issue of the game or is it a main issue of yours
    I‚Äôll readily admit that this is my own opinion and my own issue.
I'm not sure how this would play into the game.  Unless they made alternate paths. 

That being said.. maybe if they made a sequel where they opened up the wizarding world ... they could then do this?
Mine are the way to realistic and amount of freaking spiders everywhere. Freaking spidercave.
It‚Äôs not really the non-consequence driven story, because for example Skyrim also doesn‚Äôt really have that if you look at it and I have put well over 2000 hours in that game. It‚Äôs just the content for me, also in the form of content was lacking. The world is there, ready to be filled but it‚Äôs missing the content to fill it up to the point where u can turn on the game and be like: I still have so much to do! I noticed it yesterday on my maxed out character, when looking at the broom selection screen, there are a handful of brooms to choose from but the menu shows at least a double open slots as if to say ‚Äúthere are more to be collected‚Äù. The game just left me with an unfinished feeling even though I completed everything. Still liked it tho but I have trouble getting a character passed lvl20 now
Yeah, the game seems unfinished. It could have been great, but they really only made one linear storyline with no choices and called it a day. 

I liked the atmosphere of the game, the graphics and the gameplay to some extent, but the story is eh. It's linear, as you mention, but also none of the characters are interesting. Even Sebastian is incredibly basic as far as character building goes, and he's the only character where they even tried. There was recently a question here about who your favorite character was, and I realized that none of the characters have any personality to speak of. The game feels flat.
If Hogwarts Legacy and Red Dead Redemption 2 had a lovechild, it would be a fantastic game.

But I'd suggest a new one, where you're an adult.

Maybe a staff member at Hogwarts, an auror or a civilian living around Hogwarts.

With a new story (no goblins, they're lame villains), that gets you involved at Hogwarts somehow.
There are two bigger issues IMO.

Vanilla rewards. Completing Herodia's challenge rooms is the reward itself. Opening the treasure chests.. Meh.
Better kit simply increases one of your stats, that scales with the game anyway. Having beat the Quagmire troll while level 7, it really doesn't matter. It just takes longer.

Secondly,  the waiting...
...
Come back in a minute and a half for that potion.
This quest/item needs it to be night or day...
Why?
Was this meant to be fun or onerous? 

This game is gorgeous, and I find the plot engaging. I'm not coming back tho'. Perhaps someone will mod in some proper open world content.
Yeah they tried to add getting caught while sneaking around. But it's literally only in two small areas during missions and if you get caught.... Nothing happens.

They don't let you attack NPCs, you can steal from everyone, use unforgivables on enemies and respond to dialog in any way it doesn't matter.   Only one time I spoke to someone "rudely" and they refused to sell to me after.  I'm not sure if that was part of the story or because of what was said. 

Animals don't even get mad being levitated and dropped multiple tiles and shoved into a bag. I'm sure a hippogryph wouldn't stand for that.
That I agree on. Considering files in games show there was supposed to be a morality system as well as companions.. they cut a lot and I think people would‚Äôve waited a bit more to have them in the game. I think they simply removed them. Either they needed some polishing before the release and they weren‚Äôt ready or they wasn‚Äôt sure these features would be like by players. Considering the reviews it‚Äôs safe to assume most players would want the implemented so I guess they might add them in the new few months with the updates they talked about or they might be implemented in the following game.

I love the game but morality system, companions and school life would make the game even better. They kinda forgot people love Hogwarts more than anything else, so they should let people feel Hogwarts. I liked the night mini-game where yiu had to ring get caught, they should‚Äôve kept it. Another thing they could do is add interactions like eat in the great hall or sleep in bed (they could make you choose how many hours or skip the night altogether). Why not have X lessons to follow before learning a new spell? I expected lessons to be like a core feature to be honest, I don‚Äôt expect a school simulation game but school should be a big aspect of the game. I would‚Äôve loved to play games with other students like chess and gobstones. And definitely I expected house points to be a thing. That was disappointing lol

I understand the game was especially for happy potter fans, not player, so I understand the approach and I‚Äôm curious to see what‚Äôs in place for the future. I do hope the‚Äôll be some significant changes between houses tho, apart THAT quest alone. It makes it more interesting.
This game would be so much better if every dialogue had the option to cast Crucio
I'm just realizing this.  I bought the game on sale during Christmas and I'm about halfway through my first playthrough. 

I doubt I'll do another one.  

I like it, but I purposely have been a goody two shoes this time through and I was going to play a 2nd time through as a Slytherin and just be an asshole to everyone and use the unforgivables etc. 

Now that I've realized it doesn't matter I'm pissed that I told Sebastian not to teach me the curses.  I googled it and I know I can have him reach them to me before the last mission with him but still.  

I was so excited to see how my actions changed the story line and I'm really disappointed they didn't.  


I love everything else about the game but I'm about to just finish through the quests and finish the game out and put it aside for a long time probably considering nothing will change the next time I play.  

I think Skyrim  and Fallout 3/New Vegas forever ruined any game like this for me that doesn't have multiple paths.
I think the only consequence I‚Äôve seen so far is that I wouldn‚Äôt give Rococo the Niffler back and now the woman won‚Äôt sell to me. Worth it!
I actually didn‚Äôt mind the story. Especially Sebastian‚Äôs, easily the highlight of the game. Wish that was extended more. I think the biggest issue for me was exploring the various treasure caves. Nothing kills joy quite like excitedly finding a cave, working out the puzzle, making it to the end and then finding a worthless scarf. After a few, my desire to explore was 0 because it just wasn‚Äôt worth it. Same thing with the lack of enemy variety. You can only beat up on so many ashwinders and goblins before it just gets boring
See the problem with games like that is it's easy to mess up by doing something bad because it's against the developers mindset
The lack of curfew is disappointing. Particularly after that great Demiguise intro quest. Sneaking around the castle at night with consequences for getting caught would have been a ton of fun.
I like the morality concept but I like unforgivable curses as well. They should have kept both and put you down a different quest path more suitable for a murderous wizard and possibly even went as far as to offer a different ending to the more chaotic evil wizard. If you get caught using an unforgivable, game over and you go to prison, then restart at your last save. The replay value would have been 100x better with the morality.
Agreed. Casting the Unforgivable Curses should‚Äôve had real consequences, aside from professors just saying not to do it in front of them. I want to play as a good Slytherin who never even learns the curses and tries to keep Sebastian from becoming a dark wizard, but there‚Äôs no choices in regards to what he ultimately does (if you know you know). I still like the game a lot though, I‚Äôm about to start my third playthrough as a Gryffindor. My first was Ravenclaw and then (slightly evil) Slytherin.
What felt wierd to me was constantly breaking into peoples houses and stealing their gold‚Ä¶ it was a really odd feature.. especially as there is other way to make/find coins ü§£ essentially we we‚Äôre burglars but its okay because we‚Äôre witches and wizards ü§î
I feel ya I love the game but felt like most of the dialogue could have been a bit more mature like at least make it movie level mature. Also rookwood felt like a push over to me.
I actually just started up a new game this morning and the beginning cracks me up.  We start in London, get in a carriage where during the attack we are teleported to the Scottish Highlands, then teleported back to London for Gringotts, to be teleported to Hogwarts which I believe was back in Scotland.  

Am I wrong about this?
The story has truly subpar writing too
Lol what I said.  

Basically people expected this game be a cross between skyrim and Bully, but we got instead Middle Earth's version of the Wizarding world. But why would we expect different if it is a WB game.

Edit: We need an RPG of it with multiple choices.
Adding a morality meter definitely would have made people want to replay more than they will otherwise. It would've added a fun rp aspect for people who are into that as well.¬†
A lot of people want morality, and I think its be cool to have that as well as impactful decisions in general. I personally think itd be cool If there was more moral gray area. Less good choices gets you the good ending/bad decisions gives you a bad ending. If done right, players can debate on which outcome they prefer and think is better.¬†¬†


¬†And I think mass effect kinda touches this nicely. While renegade is typically the more evil option, there are times where it leads to a more beneficial outcome like the outcome of Legion's loyalty quest in ME2.¬†
Yeah it takes away from the ‚ÄúHogwarts student‚Äù experience. I guess I thought that‚Äôs what the game would focus on more, although I‚Äôm definitely not opposed to rescuing animals and slaughtering every poacher I can find‚Ä¶ LMAO
My issue is that I went into the last level and got all the way to the final boss and just could not do enough damage at all to him because I wasn‚Äôt the proper level. 

Destiny style looter game design has destroyed so many of these types of games. I mostly enjoyed it, but my god, do I hate having to do side quests in order to play story missions. Really ruins the pace of the campaigns.
I love this game to death. Hell, I have nearly 300 hours in it! But it's certainly given me a clear view of where the game fails. Story cutscenes are maybe a minute long most of the time. 
The scene where you visit Anne with Sebastian in Feldcroft. Seb and his uncle burst into an argument after maybe 2 lines of dialogue. Our character isn't even involved in this scene. The pacing is awful and I've noticed that throughout the story. It's like the writers wanted to hit story beats but never actually build up to it. It just happens.
There's no character building. 
There's no personality. 

MC is also far too nice by default. I wanted to finally play as a dark wizard and choose all the mean dialogue options but it always felt out of character because outside of dialogue options, MC is just so nice. The game doesn't adapt to how you play it. 
I chose the "evil" ending but it felt so unearned and random. I cast the imperious curse on Ominis. I enabled Sebastian's descent into the dark arts. I justified his actions to him... but now I'm besties with Poppy Sweeting and talking about how evil and cruel the poachers despite being complicit in the murder of Sebastian's uncle.
I've got 300 hours in this game and I simply don't care about the characters. I don't have a favourite character because they're so bland but have so much potential.
I really hope the sequel expands on giving us characters to care about and I'm only so critical because I want the sequel to be so much better. It can be done. I do think the game was forced out into the world in the end after countless leaks and such.
They've laid down the foundation for something brilliant and I hope they can really focus on making the sequel a brilliant experience.
The fact that the uNfOrGiVaBlEs exist in a game with no kind of karma/reputation/consequences system at all really just relegates the choice of not using them to a moralistic RP one where you intentionally choose not to use some of the most powerful spells in the game just because you decided not to, and for absolutely no other reason.

Also, the game lays bare that Avada Kedavera is a far less horrible way to go than basically any other way you can kill someone with magic.

So the experience overall just doesn't feel like I think most people would have expected.

It could have had a wanted system like GTA, where low level indiscretions could result in a teacher running up, and throwing AK at a classmate would result in aurors appearing from every direction.

It could have had a morality system like KOTOR, where your character physically changes from use of the Dark Side.

But it also could have had quidditch, but didn't because the broom flight sucked and they just wanted to shovel the game out the door to get the earnings in the right cell on a spreadsheet, so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I see a lot of complaints about the unforgivable curses but if you look at the Harry Potter storyline in general you find out that the unforgivable curses weren't outlawed until the time of Voldemort so during the time that Hogwarts Legacy takes place there were no laws against the unforgivable curses hence the reason they didn't put it in game it was only outlawed during Voldemort's time because of their outlandish misuse of it against the Muggles but I do wish there would have been more story as it seemed like the story was kind of short
It‚Äôs not just that the story is weak, it‚Äôs that it‚Äôs not in the style of Rowling. The HP narratives are all Nancy Drew, sleuth like stories with a shocking twist at the end. This one? Everything just‚Ä¶.happened? There‚Äôs was no wonder. No big reveal. No character that was unmasked. There‚Äôs intrigue for sure. But the intrigue is just resolved.
Yeah now that i think about it the story would of felt so much better and engaging but still a amazing game
My first playthrough, I got to the final climactic battle, having avoided using any Unforgivable curses anywhere in front of anyone. However, at one point a Troll nearly squashed me and, through pure muscle memory, I Crucio'd the troll. In front of the entire school, all of the students, all of the faculty, everyone.   


It was never mentioned at any point by anyone.   


This is the best Hogwarts game that has ever been released, and it's not even close, but there are some major issues with it. Things were cut from this game and it is extremely obvious.
Like in fable. 

That's my fav game and I see so many similarities between the 2 but it'd be nice if it really dove into the morality meter
    It would have been so cool! Imagine the different play throughs I'd love to replay it
    I never understood fable's attempt at morality. I can be as mean as I want and make a boatload of money over charging tenants, and as a result I get cool horns? I did all the bad stuff in every playthrough and it largely made the game easier. Yeah some people didn't like me, but by being bad I became op so fast that it didn't matter.
        Realizing that apparently im really weird. Lol

I struggle to be bad in the games. I kept trying to get 100% in fable but could never swing it. 

Yes it's easier I agree as I assume it'll be in HP learning the curses but it's such a role play mode for me to be that bad so I find it interesting.
            You're the type of person who actually pays the prostitutes in GTA lol ü§£. All love though. Whatever playstyle works for you
Yep, with certain talents gated by morality.
Eg you can petrify low health enemies without stealth if good, but only get the chain avada if youre truly evil.
[deleted]
    I never said specific rewards should be given based on your choices, just the way people see and treat you

I don't think a character should *have* to be evil to use dark magic, what if they're just a mischievous Weasley type? I just think the way NPCs treat you and your options for dialog should be changed based on how many good or bad decisions you've made

I wouldn't want to see it affect actual gameplay or abilities, just give the players the ability to role play their characters.
Isn't it confirmed there was going to be one but they didn't have time to implement it?
The issue is that Arthur is a grown man in a situation where it makes sense for his character to swing either way.

In this game you‚Äôre a student and the main story needs access to hogwarts.¬†
    How would implementing a morality system effect that? It would give the dialogue options and choices made by the character have consequences.
        Because the consequences would be breaking the gameplay.

What are you gonna do with unforgivable curses?

Azkhaban? Get expelled from school? Neither would work.

It would also break the main storyline. The whole point is to go through a series of tests to ensure that the wielder of this ancient magic is strong enough and selfless enough to not use it for evil - how are you gonna convince anyone to keep helping and aiding a student who throws unforgivable curses left and right?
            I think you‚Äôre pointing out an additional flaw of the game on top of morality. They could‚Äôve had morality and they shouldn‚Äôt have had the unforgivables. As a gamer I loved it but for the story it was BONKERS decision.
                They should block unforgivables in front of other student or professors. Like they did with the spells used to create object outside the room of requirement.

You can only use them when with sebastian or against dark art wizards, ashwinders and so on when no one else is around. 
It feels so wrong going around saving magical creatures with Poppy and then use the killing curse against doggos or spiders.
                    My headcannon for this is that the unforgivable curses are illegal to use against WIZARDS. not creatures.

Killing spiders with AK is perfectly legal (fake Moody did it in a class with no repercussions).
                        Poachers are creatures, mumbling quietly
                I think the unforgivables are a weird concept. Murder is murder no matter what spell you use. It's like banning knives just because they can be used to harm others. Avada could've been used as an euthanasia tool, because there's no pain involved
                    Are you forgetting the part that with unforgivables you really REALLY have to want/mean it? Aka you can't just nilly willy cast Crucio or AK. You literally have to be evil or blinded by a certain emotion to be able to cast them
                        I also think AK was a forbidden curse because it was the curse needed to make a Horcrux. Like you can‚Äôt just stun someone and they fall of their broom and then you can make a horcrux, you have to use Avada Kedavra in order to make a horcrux and that‚Äôs why I think it was a forbidden curse too.
                    Classic Slytherin
                I loved it too, and it was probably a higher priority and a big selling point to include for the gameplay, which probably meant scrapping any morality mechanics or just not implementing them at all. 

I dont know what I wouldve prefered to be honest. Morality mechanics over unforgivables?
                    I think morality would have been better, but then the unforgivables falls directly into that as pure evil so they should stay.

It's the consequences that would be hard to add for it, like having aurors and dementors randomly attack you to make the game more difficult when you're evil . Are teachers then mad at you, do they stop helping ? Do NPCs get involved? Shops stop serving you?   

Any good mechanics that I can think of just break the whole idea of having a linear story line.  The story needs to be more dynamic and change with your alignment to even make it work... which would  be difficult to achieve well. They didn't even bother to add quidditch, giving up half way through, so I think this would be asking too much of them.
                    Coding an entire morality system vs adding curses is Apple and oranges, the two probably didn‚Äôt affect those decisions during dev
            it dosent totally make sense for the story but my little idea just something i think is cool would be yeah you do go to askaban and while your there you befriend another prisoner or something and learn expecto patronum and get to escape
                u do realise their wands get taken off the witch/wizard when theyre put in azkaban?üíÄ
            I don't think being a student necessarily prevents a morality system, especially considering morality is such a big theme in the book series. Random (or scripted) events, like someone bullying someone in a hallway could provide a way for MC to intervene and gain honour or even house points, and choosing to encourage the bullies will make you loose honour or house points. Getting caught while sneaking around after curfew, messing up a classroom by casting spells on the intractable book stacks, antagonising students and teachers, or picking the mean dialogue option causes you to loose honour and house points. 

Using the unforgivable curses should have aurors or dementors come looking for you in the Highlands. It can be a situation where the ministry knows someone has used them (through the trace or something?) but doesn't really know who. If you get caught without disguise in the Highlands, then game over. Moreover, there can be other consequences, e.g. if you use too much unforgivable you won't be able to cast a patronus, so you need to somehow learn occlumency to avoid confrontation with dementors. Or maybe the ministry is searching for you even if you don't use AK because of your ancient magic ability, but the amount of aurors and dementors spawning will increase based on your use of those spells. I think this is doable in a sequel.
        Immagine for a second that all the ‚Äúbad choices‚Äù introduce you to a third party (I don‚Äôt know dark wizzards that likely Sebastian want to defeat the concept of pain and death) and as a result Professor Fig will fight you to stop you from using the ancient magic for the wrong reason. That would change everything.
Even if there‚Äôs an Azkaban prison they have to capture you first which means some aurors will try to chase you around the map‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know but there was so much potential for a morality system in this game.
        [deleted]
            That‚Äôs why I said choices as well.
                What are the consequences of the choices if the consequences isn‚Äôt expelled from hogwarts and that‚Äôs the end of the game¬†¬†

¬†Edit: I can‚Äôt reply to the below so I‚Äôll leave it here.¬†

¬†What are you needed for in which you can‚Äôt be expelled? Nobody knows hat you‚Äôre doing besides Fig and Natty, Poppy, and Sebastian if you tell them. If you do tell them but you want to be an asshole, you‚Äôre not needed for anything they have going on, because they‚Äôre not part of the main story and there‚Äôs no reason you need to be involved at all. Their storyline can simlly end and that‚Äôs that. Which isn‚Äôt an actual consequence.¬†

You already do have to fight everything yourself. So that‚Äôs not a consequence my anything because you already do.

Like, none of what you said works for the game at all
                    I mean, that‚Äôs a pretty unimaginative view. You could not be expelled because they know they need you, but everyone dislikes you and stops working with you. And you have to fight everything by yourself, certain storylines dry up, etc., maybe you make a side deal with the dark ones for some extra cash.
    Was Tom Riddle a grown man when he was casting unforgivables and making horcruxes?
        Yes‚Ä¶¬† ¬†In hogwarts Tom Riddle couldn‚Äôt do much of anything because of dumbledore.¬†The most he was doing was the chamber of secrets which he blamed on hagrid. (Now that I think about it, I forgot how moaning mertle died. I think it was the basalisk but I could be wrong and it was Voldemort who did it)

¬†He found out about the Horcruxes later in life and then made them.¬†
            It was the basilisk. She was crying in the toilet, heard something and open the door to the basilisk.
            Created the diary in his 5th year at Hogwarts
                Detail; he used the death of Moaning Myrtle to make the diary in his 5th year. He killed his father a year later to make the ring Horcrux, so that‚Äôs two murders/Horcruxes before he‚Äôs even left school
                I don‚Äôt remember the books ever giving dates as to when they were created. The only one was Harry
                    The portion of his soul within the diary that comes out is a child, and I think he kills his father during the events in the Pensieve in HBP, Dumbledore mentions that he was underage. The date of the murder is given as 1943, when he would have been 16 and still at school. That was also confirmed to be his second Horcrux
Unpopular opinion: RDR2's honor mechanic fell flat on its face. I shot everyone in Valentine after trying to help a prostitute dispose of a corpse, but a few days of doing chores around camp and Arthur's back to being the goodest of boys.
Ah that makes sense.
Too focused on making the open world too big. I almost hating open worlds nowadays
    I noticed that too, when I started playing. They expanded the world too much, and didn't have enough content to fill it. Hence the 50 different collecta-thons.

It's not why I quit after 8 hours, but it didn't help the game.
Hogwarts: Jump Street
    Amazing üòÇüòÇ
This! I don‚Äôt quite understand how a 15 year old is able to go toe-to-toe with fully adult/fully trained witches and wizards.¬†

In the Harry Potter books it‚Äôs understood that Harry ‚Äúlucks out‚Äù to a certain extent AND he usually gets help during his major fights.¬†

Also don‚Äôt quite understand how the MC of Hogwarts legacy is allowed to leave the castle at all hours of the day and night and never seems to do any schoolwork. Idk.¬†
    This is so annoying,  crossed wands duels felt more challenging than the grown ups who most of them didn't had prot√©g√© mastery and knew like 2 or 3 spells while the students could use several and were constantly protegoed
    Not only a 15 year old, a 15 year old in his/her 1st year of magical education. The ancient magic the mc controls must be more powerful than most wizards are able to defend against
Sebastian‚Äôs story 100% should have been the main storyline.¬†
    It mirrors Isidora's story so well that I have to believe they were planning on tying the 2 storylines together, but dropped it for some reason. Imagine if it was mandatory to see through his quest for power to the very end before having that conversation about what to do with the repository. Knowing the protagonist has Sebastian's fate fresh in their mind while going into that discussion would add so much more depth to their choice.
        I definitely think they planned on this, as they set it up with Isidora‚Äôs painting and Seb watching the memory of her taking pain with MC. I was 100% expecting it to tie in but it didn‚Äôt.
Spot on comment here. The castle is just a museum with a bunch of references to the books, and yes the open world is too big and too empty and the forest is lacking. I wish it was more focused on classes and a story that affected the school and the other students more.
I totally agree with you, in fact there was a point when I told Sebastian's uncle that I agreed with him and condemned Sebastian, only for him to answer exactly the same way as if I'd said the opposite and we ended up fighting anyways. It almost felt like a bug with how illogical it was! There were a couple more instances like this one in the game where my answers didn't matter at all.
It was already being developed for like 5 years, I think the investors just had enough and told them to shove it out the door. It really shows in the second half of the game.
    Just to show that just because someone has money doesn‚Äôt mean they are smart. 

A fully polished gem would‚Äôve been significantly better than the current release.
        Would 6 years instead of 5 years development (+20% development costs) have resulted in more than 20% more sales though? I dislike their decision as well, but financially speaking I understand it. Although you also have to wonder how this impacts the sales of a sequel (how many disappointed fans won't be buying a sequel because of this?)
            It‚Äôs HP it‚Äôll sell
                Yeah, probably
            Oh they'll buy it
        It's the best selling game of 2023
            Which it would‚Äôve been the best selling game of 2024 if they had fully polished it.
            It sold on the HP name, not its gameplay.

BG3 sold some on the D&D or BG name(me, I was gonna buy it regardless just because of the first two), but then it sold more when people started praising the writing, characters, gameplay, choices, and options.

Hogwarts Legacy got no praise for the actual content of the game.
You only have one set of tools in this game and they made it so that all of them are required at some point.

There is no possible variety.
Very much agree. I liked the linearity of the story coupled with the gorgeous exploration, puzzles, atmosphere, action, and adventure. ¬†

It‚Äôs of course fun to think about some large scale RPG interwoven multi path story with morality but I think that often comes with a cost. ¬†It‚Äôs cumbersome even when done well.
Without consequences to choices, either penalty or benefit, did you even make a choice?

Don't fall for 'illusion of choice' game design.
    I think this is a good point. There is nothing wrong with stories with no choices, but if that's the case then they should go for that instead of making the players "choose" options that don't have much of an impact. There were admittedly some choices that had some impacts, like the Ominis and Sea questline, but in most cases where you got an option you didn't make a difference to anything.
Yeah, this game appeals to the ones that watched the first movie or two and that's it.
It matters more in Skyrim. You at least had the option to be Imperial or Stormcloak, even if they ended up in the same place.

This game forces you do everything, by gating story behind collectathon bullshit.
    Does it though?
I played a "complete only the main quest" run and do you know what level you need to be to complete the final quest?
22.
Know what level I was at the point having achievely avoided most challenges? Only collecting every spell (aside for unforgiveables).

21, and I reached 22 almost immediately afterwards.

The game does not force you to do the side stuff, or the merlin trials, or the ancient magic upgrade puzzles. Not for the main story.
        I logged 8.1 hours into the game, then uninstalled.

No Man's Sky had deeper content at launch than this game does now.
            Lol, hello hyperbole
Besides ‚ÄúI cant believe she didn‚Äôt tell me the answer when I showed it to her!‚Äù Because honestly I felt better about my decision every time a student got upset lol
Oooh! I like the idea of increasing the dark wizards per curse.
It makes it feel like a game from yesteryear, where you can go in people's houses, break their stuff and dig in their trash with no consequences. I rather liked it.
    It's funny you say that, because of a lot of those games had consequences for doing shit like that. Even Zelda had the chicken army consequence of hitting chickens too many times.
In Skyrim, pissing off any guild got you banned until you paid a penalty in gold.

What happens in this game when you run around using Dark Arts in front of teachers or breaking into their personal rooms? Nothing beyond a comment or two. That's not a consequence; that is a pointed lack of consequence.
I‚Äôll readily admit that this is my own opinion and my own issue.
It would have been so cool! Imagine the different play throughs I'd love to replay it
I never understood fable's attempt at morality. I can be as mean as I want and make a boatload of money over charging tenants, and as a result I get cool horns? I did all the bad stuff in every playthrough and it largely made the game easier. Yeah some people didn't like me, but by being bad I became op so fast that it didn't matter.
    Realizing that apparently im really weird. Lol

I struggle to be bad in the games. I kept trying to get 100% in fable but could never swing it. 

Yes it's easier I agree as I assume it'll be in HP learning the curses but it's such a role play mode for me to be that bad so I find it interesting.
        You're the type of person who actually pays the prostitutes in GTA lol ü§£. All love though. Whatever playstyle works for you
I never said specific rewards should be given based on your choices, just the way people see and treat you

I don't think a character should *have* to be evil to use dark magic, what if they're just a mischievous Weasley type? I just think the way NPCs treat you and your options for dialog should be changed based on how many good or bad decisions you've made

I wouldn't want to see it affect actual gameplay or abilities, just give the players the ability to role play their characters.
How would implementing a morality system effect that? It would give the dialogue options and choices made by the character have consequences.
    Because the consequences would be breaking the gameplay.

What are you gonna do with unforgivable curses?

Azkhaban? Get expelled from school? Neither would work.

It would also break the main storyline. The whole point is to go through a series of tests to ensure that the wielder of this ancient magic is strong enough and selfless enough to not use it for evil - how are you gonna convince anyone to keep helping and aiding a student who throws unforgivable curses left and right?
        I think you‚Äôre pointing out an additional flaw of the game on top of morality. They could‚Äôve had morality and they shouldn‚Äôt have had the unforgivables. As a gamer I loved it but for the story it was BONKERS decision.
            They should block unforgivables in front of other student or professors. Like they did with the spells used to create object outside the room of requirement.

You can only use them when with sebastian or against dark art wizards, ashwinders and so on when no one else is around. 
It feels so wrong going around saving magical creatures with Poppy and then use the killing curse against doggos or spiders.
                My headcannon for this is that the unforgivable curses are illegal to use against WIZARDS. not creatures.

Killing spiders with AK is perfectly legal (fake Moody did it in a class with no repercussions).
                    Poachers are creatures, mumbling quietly
            I think the unforgivables are a weird concept. Murder is murder no matter what spell you use. It's like banning knives just because they can be used to harm others. Avada could've been used as an euthanasia tool, because there's no pain involved
                Are you forgetting the part that with unforgivables you really REALLY have to want/mean it? Aka you can't just nilly willy cast Crucio or AK. You literally have to be evil or blinded by a certain emotion to be able to cast them
                    I also think AK was a forbidden curse because it was the curse needed to make a Horcrux. Like you can‚Äôt just stun someone and they fall of their broom and then you can make a horcrux, you have to use Avada Kedavra in order to make a horcrux and that‚Äôs why I think it was a forbidden curse too.
                Classic Slytherin
            I loved it too, and it was probably a higher priority and a big selling point to include for the gameplay, which probably meant scrapping any morality mechanics or just not implementing them at all. 

I dont know what I wouldve prefered to be honest. Morality mechanics over unforgivables?
                I think morality would have been better, but then the unforgivables falls directly into that as pure evil so they should stay.

It's the consequences that would be hard to add for it, like having aurors and dementors randomly attack you to make the game more difficult when you're evil . Are teachers then mad at you, do they stop helping ? Do NPCs get involved? Shops stop serving you?   

Any good mechanics that I can think of just break the whole idea of having a linear story line.  The story needs to be more dynamic and change with your alignment to even make it work... which would  be difficult to achieve well. They didn't even bother to add quidditch, giving up half way through, so I think this would be asking too much of them.
                Coding an entire morality system vs adding curses is Apple and oranges, the two probably didn‚Äôt affect those decisions during dev
        it dosent totally make sense for the story but my little idea just something i think is cool would be yeah you do go to askaban and while your there you befriend another prisoner or something and learn expecto patronum and get to escape
            u do realise their wands get taken off the witch/wizard when theyre put in azkaban?üíÄ
        I don't think being a student necessarily prevents a morality system, especially considering morality is such a big theme in the book series. Random (or scripted) events, like someone bullying someone in a hallway could provide a way for MC to intervene and gain honour or even house points, and choosing to encourage the bullies will make you loose honour or house points. Getting caught while sneaking around after curfew, messing up a classroom by casting spells on the intractable book stacks, antagonising students and teachers, or picking the mean dialogue option causes you to loose honour and house points. 

Using the unforgivable curses should have aurors or dementors come looking for you in the Highlands. It can be a situation where the ministry knows someone has used them (through the trace or something?) but doesn't really know who. If you get caught without disguise in the Highlands, then game over. Moreover, there can be other consequences, e.g. if you use too much unforgivable you won't be able to cast a patronus, so you need to somehow learn occlumency to avoid confrontation with dementors. Or maybe the ministry is searching for you even if you don't use AK because of your ancient magic ability, but the amount of aurors and dementors spawning will increase based on your use of those spells. I think this is doable in a sequel.
    Immagine for a second that all the ‚Äúbad choices‚Äù introduce you to a third party (I don‚Äôt know dark wizzards that likely Sebastian want to defeat the concept of pain and death) and as a result Professor Fig will fight you to stop you from using the ancient magic for the wrong reason. That would change everything.
Even if there‚Äôs an Azkaban prison they have to capture you first which means some aurors will try to chase you around the map‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know but there was so much potential for a morality system in this game.
    [deleted]
        That‚Äôs why I said choices as well.
            What are the consequences of the choices if the consequences isn‚Äôt expelled from hogwarts and that‚Äôs the end of the game¬†¬†

¬†Edit: I can‚Äôt reply to the below so I‚Äôll leave it here.¬†

¬†What are you needed for in which you can‚Äôt be expelled? Nobody knows hat you‚Äôre doing besides Fig and Natty, Poppy, and Sebastian if you tell them. If you do tell them but you want to be an asshole, you‚Äôre not needed for anything they have going on, because they‚Äôre not part of the main story and there‚Äôs no reason you need to be involved at all. Their storyline can simlly end and that‚Äôs that. Which isn‚Äôt an actual consequence.¬†

You already do have to fight everything yourself. So that‚Äôs not a consequence my anything because you already do.

Like, none of what you said works for the game at all
                I mean, that‚Äôs a pretty unimaginative view. You could not be expelled because they know they need you, but everyone dislikes you and stops working with you. And you have to fight everything by yourself, certain storylines dry up, etc., maybe you make a side deal with the dark ones for some extra cash.
Was Tom Riddle a grown man when he was casting unforgivables and making horcruxes?
    Yes‚Ä¶¬† ¬†In hogwarts Tom Riddle couldn‚Äôt do much of anything because of dumbledore.¬†The most he was doing was the chamber of secrets which he blamed on hagrid. (Now that I think about it, I forgot how moaning mertle died. I think it was the basalisk but I could be wrong and it was Voldemort who did it)

¬†He found out about the Horcruxes later in life and then made them.¬†
        It was the basilisk. She was crying in the toilet, heard something and open the door to the basilisk.
        Created the diary in his 5th year at Hogwarts
            Detail; he used the death of Moaning Myrtle to make the diary in his 5th year. He killed his father a year later to make the ring Horcrux, so that‚Äôs two murders/Horcruxes before he‚Äôs even left school
            I don‚Äôt remember the books ever giving dates as to when they were created. The only one was Harry
                The portion of his soul within the diary that comes out is a child, and I think he kills his father during the events in the Pensieve in HBP, Dumbledore mentions that he was underage. The date of the murder is given as 1943, when he would have been 16 and still at school. That was also confirmed to be his second Horcrux
I noticed that too, when I started playing. They expanded the world too much, and didn't have enough content to fill it. Hence the 50 different collecta-thons.

It's not why I quit after 8 hours, but it didn't help the game.
Amazing üòÇüòÇ
This is so annoying,  crossed wands duels felt more challenging than the grown ups who most of them didn't had prot√©g√© mastery and knew like 2 or 3 spells while the students could use several and were constantly protegoed
Not only a 15 year old, a 15 year old in his/her 1st year of magical education. The ancient magic the mc controls must be more powerful than most wizards are able to defend against
It mirrors Isidora's story so well that I have to believe they were planning on tying the 2 storylines together, but dropped it for some reason. Imagine if it was mandatory to see through his quest for power to the very end before having that conversation about what to do with the repository. Knowing the protagonist has Sebastian's fate fresh in their mind while going into that discussion would add so much more depth to their choice.
    I definitely think they planned on this, as they set it up with Isidora‚Äôs painting and Seb watching the memory of her taking pain with MC. I was 100% expecting it to tie in but it didn‚Äôt.
Just to show that just because someone has money doesn‚Äôt mean they are smart. 

A fully polished gem would‚Äôve been significantly better than the current release.
    Would 6 years instead of 5 years development (+20% development costs) have resulted in more than 20% more sales though? I dislike their decision as well, but financially speaking I understand it. Although you also have to wonder how this impacts the sales of a sequel (how many disappointed fans won't be buying a sequel because of this?)
        It‚Äôs HP it‚Äôll sell
            Yeah, probably
        Oh they'll buy it
    It's the best selling game of 2023
        Which it would‚Äôve been the best selling game of 2024 if they had fully polished it.
        It sold on the HP name, not its gameplay.

BG3 sold some on the D&D or BG name(me, I was gonna buy it regardless just because of the first two), but then it sold more when people started praising the writing, characters, gameplay, choices, and options.

Hogwarts Legacy got no praise for the actual content of the game.

    Detail; he used the death of Moaning Myrtle to make the diary in his 5th year. He killed his father a year later to make the ring Horcrux, so that‚Äôs two murders/Horcruxes before he‚Äôs even left school
    I don‚Äôt remember the books ever giving dates as to when they were created. The only one was Harry
        The portion of his soul within the diary that comes out is a child, and I think he kills his father during the events in the Pensieve in HBP, Dumbledore mentions that he was underage. The date of the murder is given as 1943, when he would have been 16 and still at school. That was also confirmed to be his second Horcrux
It‚Äôs HP it‚Äôll sell
    Yeah, probably
Oh they'll buy it
Which it would‚Äôve been the best selling game of 2024 if they had fully polished it.
It sold on the HP name, not its gameplay.

BG3 sold some on the D&D or BG name(me, I was gonna buy it regardless just because of the first two), but then it sold more when people started praising the writing, characters, gameplay, choices, and options.

Hogwarts Legacy got no praise for the actual content of the game.
Lol, hello hyperbole
They should block unforgivables in front of other student or professors. Like they did with the spells used to create object outside the room of requirement.

You can only use them when with sebastian or against dark art wizards, ashwinders and so on when no one else is around. 
It feels so wrong going around saving magical creatures with Poppy and then use the killing curse against doggos or spiders.
    My headcannon for this is that the unforgivable curses are illegal to use against WIZARDS. not creatures.

Killing spiders with AK is perfectly legal (fake Moody did it in a class with no repercussions).
        Poachers are creatures, mumbling quietly
I think the unforgivables are a weird concept. Murder is murder no matter what spell you use. It's like banning knives just because they can be used to harm others. Avada could've been used as an euthanasia tool, because there's no pain involved
    Are you forgetting the part that with unforgivables you really REALLY have to want/mean it? Aka you can't just nilly willy cast Crucio or AK. You literally have to be evil or blinded by a certain emotion to be able to cast them
        I also think AK was a forbidden curse because it was the curse needed to make a Horcrux. Like you can‚Äôt just stun someone and they fall of their broom and then you can make a horcrux, you have to use Avada Kedavra in order to make a horcrux and that‚Äôs why I think it was a forbidden curse too.
    Classic Slytherin
I loved it too, and it was probably a higher priority and a big selling point to include for the gameplay, which probably meant scrapping any morality mechanics or just not implementing them at all. 

I dont know what I wouldve prefered to be honest. Morality mechanics over unforgivables?
    I think morality would have been better, but then the unforgivables falls directly into that as pure evil so they should stay.

It's the consequences that would be hard to add for it, like having aurors and dementors randomly attack you to make the game more difficult when you're evil . Are teachers then mad at you, do they stop helping ? Do NPCs get involved? Shops stop serving you?   

Any good mechanics that I can think of just break the whole idea of having a linear story line.  The story needs to be more dynamic and change with your alignment to even make it work... which would  be difficult to achieve well. They didn't even bother to add quidditch, giving up half way through, so I think this would be asking too much of them.
    Coding an entire morality system vs adding curses is Apple and oranges, the two probably didn‚Äôt affect those decisions during dev
u do realise their wands get taken off the witch/wizard when theyre put in azkaban?üíÄ
What are the consequences of the choices if the consequences isn‚Äôt expelled from hogwarts and that‚Äôs the end of the game¬†¬†

¬†Edit: I can‚Äôt reply to the below so I‚Äôll leave it here.¬†

¬†What are you needed for in which you can‚Äôt be expelled? Nobody knows hat you‚Äôre doing besides Fig and Natty, Poppy, and Sebastian if you tell them. If you do tell them but you want to be an asshole, you‚Äôre not needed for anything they have going on, because they‚Äôre not part of the main story and there‚Äôs no reason you need to be involved at all. Their storyline can simlly end and that‚Äôs that. Which isn‚Äôt an actual consequence.¬†

You already do have to fight everything yourself. So that‚Äôs not a consequence my anything because you already do.

Like, none of what you said works for the game at all
    I mean, that‚Äôs a pretty unimaginative view. You could not be expelled because they know they need you, but everyone dislikes you and stops working with you. And you have to fight everything by yourself, certain storylines dry up, etc., maybe you make a side deal with the dark ones for some extra cash.
