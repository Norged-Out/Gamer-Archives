[[Almost a year later, what did you think of Hogwarts Legacy]]


I was gifted the game over Christmas so just started playing. I’m about 15 hours in and roughly halfway through the campaign. I love the setting and world but it feels like such a generic Ubisoft style open world game.

Repetitive quests, arbitrary level-gating main quests where you’re forced to do “side” content. Combat is fun but simple. I can see why it sold well because it has reverence for the IP and is generic yet competent enough to please a broad spectrum of players.

I’ll see it through to the end as it’s not very challenging but it basically feels like a decent 20 hour game stretched out into an ok 30 hours that outstays it’s welcome. 

What did you think?


I picked it up on sale about a month ago and just finished it over the holidays. For the first half of the game it was genuinely amazing, it felt so surreal to finally have a Harry Potter game that's truly open world and where you can go anywhere and find almost anything you can think of from the books or movies. Even in terms of gameplay I enjoyed the first half a lot, when you had lots of classes to attend and exploring around Hogwarts, Hogsmeade and the Forbidden Forest was exciting. Learning new spells and how to brew potions, grow plants for ingredients and breed beasts was great.

Then in the second half things started to feel pretty repetitive. Hardly any of the quests were in Hogwarts but in the more extreme edges of the map that just felt like a chore to get to. And after travelling back and forth from the room of requirement to Hogsmeade and other nearby locations, the traversal started to get stale so I started fast travelling almost all the time. And all the main story quests felt like they either involved clearing out cave of spiders or a mine full of goblins. The combat is also decent, however it is a bit easy once you get the hang of it, and even when turning the difficulty up to hard I was disappointed to find that it basically just made all of the enemies bullet (or spell) sponges, which really doesn't make the game any harder when you can carry up to 25 health potions, it just makes the combat more of a grind than anything.

The main story was okay, not terrible but nothing amazing. I enjoyed Sebastian and Poppy's questlines the most I think. I think the best part was the feeling of discovery and being a student in the first half of the game. If they had aimed for a shorter and smaller but more meaningful experience I think it would have avoided the repetitiveness and bloaty feeling of the second half.
    Yeah this about sums it up for me. Fantastic job with the art design / world though.
        Likewise with me. I haven't really dived into the Ubisoft formula much so it was pretty fresh but I did feel that stale aimless repetitive feeling towards the later half.

If they do a #2 sequel and really flesh things out, they could have quite the engaging full game.
    I totally agree with you about the first half of the game versus the second half.

The southern part of the game map felt very uninteresting, and I wanted to spend as little time there as possible. That whole area of the map felt obligatory for completing the field guide, but I was otherwise not excited about being there.

Regarding the difficulty, I noticed that once you hit max XP and you're able to cap out on your defense and offense (450 I think?), you become really powerful even at the higher difficulty settings, especially with certain builds like the Chomping Cabbage build. Those cabbages can tear through even the toughest ogres without a sweat. But I don't mind, and in fact I prefer games that reward me with ridiculous power at the very end. But reaching that maximum basically requires 100%'ing the game, and at that point there really isn't anything else to do. There's not much replayability within a single character slot.
        That same person feels  very excited about being there.. spending the Hogwarts..money for very expensive rooms on the holidays!!...... seems like everyone has their thoughts crossed!!..🤷🏾‍♀️ ask ya self why
    Nailed it. There's a strong foundation to build on there though....I think if they could flesh out the school part by making it a bit Persona like, then they'd have a real winner
        i think most games should stay away from "making it a bit persona like". it's hard to pull off, and if you don't pull it off, you end up with countless hours of boring dialogue. e.g. midnight suns

    > Harry Potter game that's truly open world and where you can go anywhere and find almost anything you can think of from the books or movies

Dude!! Play the games based on the movies, most of them feature an open world Hogwarts to explore. Not to the degree of this game, but they still do. Chamber of Secrets and Prisoner of Azkaban were my favourites.

The first three games are based more on the books than the movies too. They feature characters and scenes that didn't make it into the movies plus the art style is way more book like on top of it.
        PoA was the one I had that I just kept playing over and over non stop from start to finish and getting everything to 100%.
Flying Buckbeak felt just as amazing as in the movie, and when you encounter the Dementors during the mission for fairy wings during the snow storm? I still remember all that. Good times.
        Oddly the game boy colour games both had completely open Hogwarts to wanser around in despite being the most technically limited console.
        Haha those are actually the only 2 Harry Potter games I had as a kid. Chamber of Secrets on GBA and Prisoner of Azkaban on PC. I don't remember Chamber of secrets being open world, but that's probably because it was the gameboy version. Prisoner of Azkaban was pretty awesome though.
    This was 100% my experience. Exploring Hogwarts, Hogsmeade, seeing the Wizardi g world come to life in all its amazing detail.. assisting classes, going on andventures… it seemed like a dream made reality.

But when the honeymoon phase falls off all you are left with is a repetitive combat system , repetitive button mashing fights, uninspired world design outside of Hogsmeade and the Castle, repetitive sidequests that reward you with loot that is ultimately not worth upgrading or crafting because of how easy it is to just get a better drop. It was honestly a real chore to finish this game. Still, it wasn’t a BAD game. Solid 7/10 experience, probably an 8 if you are a massive Potterhead.

I still feel this was a great first title… and can hope they massively improve the sidequesting and core gameplay loop for the inevitable sequel.
    Agree with this. Tbh, Hogwarts is the first game I’ve played that felt truly next gen to me. Having that huge castle with so many things happening at once, and being able to near-seamlessly transition to an open world? Along with some of the best animations I’ve seen in a game. I just wish the map was smaller/more interesting and there was more enemy variety.
    > Then in the second half things started to feel pretty repetitive.

Sums up the book series accurately as well.
Once the Harry Potter high falls off … it fell off for me. 


That’s it , hope their next game they take a harder look at some of the mechanics for the open world. 


Tenth cave in a row that’s a straight path to a chest with redundant gear.
    >Tenth cave in a row that’s a straight path to a chest with redundant gear.

random loot was the worst part for me. it made it pointless to explore or do side stuff. random loot has it's place, but when I solve a puzzle, or find a secret, I expect to get something 'good'.
        Oh I spent an hour getting to a box with nothing in it except garb even Dobby wouldn't wear
            [deleted]
                Yeah the itemization was really dull, it was neat that it changed your appearance but the stats themself felt so uninteresting and boring. I would sometimes be wearing something I had found 10 new armor sets ago because nothing new was a big enough difference to consider using instead.
            Tbh this kinda reminds me of Morrowind loot where you'd kill some mini boss and he just drops an empty bottle and a chitin dagger (shittiest weapon in the game)
                [removed]
                    Yeah, Skyrim is the actual offender here with constant random leveled loot making the already gamey "master chest at the end of every dungeon" more underwhelming.
        Hogwarts school uniforms on everyone meanwhile we got the idiot MC running around in a tutu, bowl of fruit in their head wearing stripper boots shooting aveda kedvra down the hall from the principals office.
            That was pretty much the only good thing about the loot tbh. The stuff you could get was so hideous it was clearly deliberate. I only played because my wife is a big Harry Potter fan and it drove her nuts to watch me in serious cutscenes wearing a Hannibal Lector mask and jester outfit.
                [removed]
                    Or maybe people had more fun being silly. Crazy that you went straight to discrediting them
                        This game has a lot of weird fans who don't want to hear anything that sounds like criticism.
                            It's the people that don't play a lot of videogames. Not to be an elitist but most of the people that praised this game were people whose first open world game was Hogwarts Legacy, they had no frame of reference
                    Why the fuck would I want to do that? The random ass gear is the best part of the game.
            There was an update very early on that let you wear any item and turn the appearance to something else. So you could wear anything and look like a normal hogwarts student.
                super annoying to change the transmog for every new item though.
                    There's a mod that auto swaps for you depending on location
                        ah shit, where were you 2 weeks ago? :)
                            yeah that and skipping the lockpick game are must haves
                That wasn't an update IIRC, just a feature no one paid attention to at the start.
            This is my favorite part of the game so far, tbh
        Even most games are semi-random. So like if you beat a boss they make sure you're drawing from a limited list of better drops so you don't get like, a bunch of common boots or something.
        I have a weird feeling and can't decide if random loot is better than set loot.

For example for me Elden ring had no replayability because it wasn't fun to do yet again a dungeon that I've done, to get the loot I already got with my first character.
I mean, it makes it easier for you to go for another kind of build but that's it.

Even in elden ring, after a while, I was bored of doing the dungeons, and I searched on the internet whhat are the drops and got the ones I cared about. So I guess in a way it makes it better because otherwise I couldn't be bothered to do every dungeon till I got the drop I wanted.

But for this game, I didn't really cared about the gear that much in a sense of "need to make a certain build". It was whatever I get if it has higher stats I'm equipping it. So I didn't mind the randomness.
            Elden Ring will probably be one of their best games to play with a randomizer, but i'm typically fine in general with replaying the games after a bit of time.

I'm looking forward to starting my 2nd playthrough once the DLC gets an actual release date.
                > Elden Ring will probably be one of their best games to play with a randomizer

My friend and I are currently on probably our 4th [randomizer](https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/428) + [seamless co-op](https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/510) run of Elden Ring. It's a blast. Most runs eventually have some funny or outrageous scenarios with enemy/boss placement.

For those reading this that are unfamiliar with Souls games randomizers: You can adjust the degree of "randomization" in several ways with the tool. Item and enemy placement are independently controlled, there's a pool of "important locations" that important items can be restricted to (and you can control which locations are considered important), or they can be sent to any random spot. There's sliders for "how random" enemies and items are. And several other tweaks and options.

Also, you can also somewhat get around the loot randomization if you decide you really want a particular item but don't know where it is. There is an option that allows you to purchase item location hints from Kale at the Church of Elle (the vendor in the church closest to the beginning of the game). Also, the randomizer has a `spoiler_logs` folder that can either provide general hints for where an item is, or it will give an exact location, without having to spend runes on hints in-game. So, if it wasn't placed too deep into late game areas while you're still in early game, you can probably go get an item to fit your build if you want.

It's a fun way to replay the game, especially with a friend using the seamless co-op mod.
            I feel like set loot adds more to the replayability. With set loot I'll know "alright so I need this armor and this sword, they are here and here so I need to figure out the best way to get there" and make a different build quickly to make the experience different. With random loot it's just annoying having to micromanage my inventory every ~10 minutes just to make sure I'm not using something worse.
            There's a difference between a randomized loot table and completely random stats. 
Randomized loot is almost always bad in my opinion. It just becomes a game of repetitive garbage collection and basically a gacha game.

I'd argue that Elden Ring probably isn't the best comparison because of the huge build variety. Loot might as well be random if you're not really planning to look anything up. Most of what you pick up isn't going to fit your build. But you'd never want the stat scaling on those items to be completely randomized where you might never get the roll you need on a certain weapon. That's just disappointing and makes you suffer through painful areas that exist only to completely waste your time.

Games need to find better ways to add replay value than having people fishing for randomized loot to pad their game time.
                For me it really depends on the game or the type of game I guess. 

I don't mind some RNG when it comes to items. For example, I loved playing a game like Destiny 2 or a MMORPG where doing a raid, wouldn't mean you'd get the item you want. (Not talking about shitty currency to craft gear, but actual gear piece).

It makes it exciting for me to play the raid over and over again to get that good, unique piece of loot and if the game is fun, the better.

I wouldn't like if that piece of gear would be a guarantee drop or if it has random stats and I need to get the same piece of gear for 1000x times till I get the stats I want.

I'm in a really weird position when it comes to these things.
            That's how I felt for replays of Elden Ring, it makes it a lot weaker for replays strictly. However that first experience with the game is so magical, finding unique loot everywhere and rewarding (even though you won't use most weaps or spells as they don't match your build). The weapons having their own moveset adds to the value on its own imo
I would take the unique set loot everywhere like Elden Ring did for an amazing first experience (100+ for me) rather than better replayability for the alternative
    > That’s it , hope their next game they take a harder look at some of the mechanics for the open world.

95 Merlin Trials in the game. The first ten were novel and unique, then you slowly realize that all the following trials are just rehashes of the first few. Tying inventory space, which is an important game mechanic, to completing Merlin Trials is just one of the long list of annoyances that drove me to uninstall the game.
        Also locking the Alohomora spell behind a stupid long quest line killed all my interest in exploring the open world in the beginning when every second door or chest is locked...
            Unlock Alohomora to get demiguises which is used to level up Alohomora which is used to get more demiguises which is used to level up Alohomora one more time which is used to find useless shit.
        you "only" need like 50 to max out the slots I think. I looked at the map and saw only a few remaining, thought I'd go for the achievement. Little did I know that you need to "discover" them first, which I found out way too late, I was missing like ~35.
        Finding out about the Merlin trials was my glass shattering moment. Literally like the Toy Story 2 “I don’t wanna play with you anymore” scene, I just lost all desire to pick the game back up.
        Yeah felt the same about the Arkham Knight riddler trophies and why I've stopped playing it. Developers should really stop with these repetitive things in games, especially when it's tied to something important.
        If only another particular game released this year had even that amount of variety.
    > Once the Harry Potter high falls off … it fell off for me.

I think about this sometimes with licensed games I like. I adore the Ghostbusters game Terminal Reality made but during my last replay I wondered if someone wasn't a huge Ghostbusters dork like I am, would they be able to get *anything* out of it? It's a good game, but is it good enough to really grab hold of someone who doesn't care that the original cast is in that game, or that the painting of Vigo is in the firehouse?

When the whole shitshow about this game started brewing someone who didn't play games asked me if I was going to get it and I said no, purely because I'm not into Harry Potter at all. No idea if I'd be able to get past that so I just didn't bother.
        Not a lot of licensed games that stand out even without the license. GoldenEye, obviously. The Arkham games and the new Spider-Man games (although it's hard to imagine someone not liking those characters and liking the gameplay). Maybe the two towers and rotk games? Maybe some of the Star wars games?
            These are good choices. Similarily I think the Mordor games would have worked on their own merit with the Nemesis system etc. It was kind of shoehorned into LotR lore anyway
                I'm not a LotR fan (liked the books, movies were fine), and I thought the first game was fun. The second game ended up being more of a slog, and I hated everything about Shelob turning into a sexy woman.
                    The second one irritates me to no end because I'm quite certain that the only reason it was a slog is because WB was flagrant trying to push those orc lootboxes so the grind was padded out to absurd degrees.

Once the game fell off the radar a little bit they went back, removed the store, and reduced the grind by a whopping 30%.

How much praise would that game be getting if they had just made it fun to begin with instead of deliberately hamstringing it to push MTX?

I'd love for someone who was bored of the game to go back and re-evaluate it without all the empty calories but "hey will you go play this game you already think is incredibly boring for me?" isn't exactly a compelling sales pitch.
                        I played post-lootbox and it was still grindy....but I also checked out of the story pretty quickly and just wanted to get my 100%. Whatever balance the first game had found didn't carry long into the second.
            There are tons of good licensed games in various niches even if you ignore specific franchise appeal, what people think if is always in the AAA sphere. Dragonball, Alien, TMNT, Scott Pilgrim, various Star Trek games, Riddick
            I think Republic Commando would fit, you don't have to be a fan of Star Wars to like that game. Solid shooter, squad based gameplay, good level design, etc. 

"Get some bacta Delta!"
                Republic Commando and KOTOR are the ones that could stand without the licence. Mass Effect essentially is just more modern KOTOR without the licence.

I'm a relatively good judge; I don't like Star Wars that much.
                    KOTOR kinda ruined star wars for me; no other star wars media (outside of the books and comics) hits the heights of KOTOR 1 and 2 to me. They feel like they actually flesh out the star wars universe, and makes all the shows and movies a little bittersweet from not using some of the themes and in universe things that KOTOR established.
                        I agree totally. The films feel flat compared to how richly the setting can be opened up in an RPG. Beyond the corporate meddling and the simply formulaic storytelling (present across the series tbh), the films simply don't have enough time to get into it - and are restricted by making it kid-friendly.

There's such an opportunity for a modern KoTOR, especially after the success of BG3. I just don't want EA to have anything to do with it beyond handing it off to a talented studio.
                    I'm surprised to hear that Kotor lands. That feels like you have to like Star Wars to like it, to me
                        KOTOR benefits from being, well, set in the Old Republic. The barrier to entry is just “liking sci-fi” and then the only concepts you really need to know about from Star Wars are lightsabers and Force powers, everything else is pretty self contained.
                            I think it could be a barrier if you've literally seen 0 star wars. But even just a movie or two and you've gotten enough of an intro for KOTOR.

And I mean... It's gotta be a majority of western audiences that have seen a (single) star wars movie... right?
                        Nah, honestly Star Wars benefits from being a fairly generic setting.

So it was actually rare that you needed to be a fan of the series, to like any of the games. Since most were their own thing separate from the movies.

Most of the games could've been a new IP. These games like KOTOR or Rougue Squadron just happen to have Star Wars themes/skins.
            Arkham and Spider-Man games are totally reliant on the franchise though. It's fun BECAUSE you play those superheroes. And they're frankly very similar to Hogwarts Legacy in being a "generic open world" by the way (they have better stories though)
                I would disagree. I think removing the franchise the games would still be fun. If Spidey had a zip line instead of web, it would still be fun to zoot around the city and I don't think I've seen any Batman media where he just hangs around on gargoyles.
                    I mean if you remove the franchise you remove the whole gadgets, combat system as it is, the traversal system for both games, the story, the enemies type, the environments... (all of this come from the franchise) and you're left with the template of an open world game, exactly like with Hogwarts Legacy. 

I don't see how that's different. Games are carried by their setting all the time (it can be a franchise but also just something like Ghost of Tsushima carried by the medieval Japan setting executed very well or Horizon by the robot dinosaurs to fight)
                        I mean you are removing gameplay in those examples. There is no reason why you can't keep the elements that are from the franchise.

There was a game, whose name escapes me now, developed a few years ago that was made by someone who worked on the Spider-Man 2 movie tie in game. It was basically about web slinging but with no Spider-man, they just used a grapple gadget to create the same effect. The Arkham game could easily be reskinned as a Ninja game. Tonnes of games give the players gadgets to use, so it is not uniquely Batman.
            The Scott pilgrim videogame is a really solid side-scrolling beat 'em up, which was made for the movie.
                I am just playing it wrong or is that game really difficult? I've put a bunch of time into it and I still can't get passed the second level?
                    If you have a second controller you can do some cheats to give yourself a bunch of money and get a bunch of upgrades in the first level. 

(link for the cheat: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDxTcptNT9Q)

But yeah the game is kinda difficult at first, unless you get a bunch of upgrades.
                        Ah, okay. Thanks. I was really surprised I was making little to no progress and I felt I couldn't use other characters because they weren't leveled. Good to know I'm not mad and grinding is part of the game.
        The only IP game that holds up regardless of fandom is Shrek Superslam, because it's mechanically just so fucking awesome and a ton of fun.
    Same here. First 20-ish hours were brilliant from riding that high, but once it falls off and the rest of the game really sets in, it gets old quick. 

I don’t think it was bad, but it was definitely way too big and too much bloat. Just Hogwarts and Hogsmeade would have been a sufficient enough map, but the game being as huge as it is was definitely a detriment to me

EDIT: also a lot of the gameplay systems were basically pointless. Gear? Pointless. Even the neat breeding minigame in the Room of Requirement was completely pointless, and the novelty wore off after a bit. It was definitely a game that I have to assume suffered from massive scope creep and would have really benefitted from being smaller and more focused. And the story being another “THE CHOSEN ONE” was a bit of an eye roll 

I would have loved a metroidvania style set solely in Hogwarts and the grounds. You could unlock new sections of the castle when you learn new spells, things like that. Combat encounters might have been a little difficult to justify, but maybe you could just say that the students like to duel. Or maybe there’s certain sections of the castle that are prone to monsters. In any case, I think that would have been a much better game.
        Yeah they definitely should have scaled it back a lot. Keep Hogwarts, Hogsmeade, the Forbidden Forest, and a little bit of the area around Hogwarts and Hogsmeade (Upper and Lower Hogsfield).
            Or even keep everything up until that lower portion of the map with the coastline that doesn't open up until like past halfway through the game. The rest of the world was pretty awesome to explore or just fly around in, and that initial area of the map localized within the first half of the game felt like a great size. The moment the bottom part of the map was when the burnout started to creep in for me. That was a little overwhelming and pretty unnecessary even for the story.
                Agreed. What was even down there? Plus with a map that big I had zero desire to fly there. I’d literally fast travel to the nearest marker and then fly.
            That was my assumption. No reason they couldn't just add places as they go with more content, themes/biomes or whatever, etc.
            I loved the size. It was nice seeing the grounds around and flying, as that’s the world that Hogwarts exists in and it’s amazing to explore. It feels odd in this day to be artificially kept to the castle. 

That said they just needed better mechanics, story, and things to fill said world with.
        What you’re describing (the game you wanted) sounds more like the Lego Harry Potter games actually.
        Reminds me the early days of the PS3 generation, the open world games had to be bigger and bigger, this sequel has 3x the size if compared to the original, blablabla even to this day some games repeats that concept, which is dumb, if I'm not mistaken it was leaked that GTA 6 map will be 2x bigger than Red Dead 2. Size just for the sake of it, bloat without meaningful content
            >if I'm not mistaken it was leaked that GTA 6 map will be 2x bigger than Red Dead 2. 

I'm fine with that, it's fun to explore the map with a car, go several minutes at top speed on highways, etc. Just hope they make a balanced map instead of a map like 5's that has one big city and fuck all in the rest of it.
                It depends if the traversal is fun or not. I honestly had a big smile on my face when they announced Spider-Man 2 would be way bigger, the game will feature a extra island, etc.. because I love to move around in that game, never used quick travel. As for GTA, I am not a big fan of the moon physiques, so the leak kinda disappointed me a little bit. Red Dead 2 works because the horse riding feels relaxing, also the realistic physiques can lead to some goofy situations. GTA is all over the place, you touch a little obstacle and the car catapults in the air... I know a lot of people love this, but I am not a big fan tbh
            The thing with GTA is that the gameplay usually helps or goes nicely with the increased size of the map. Especially as those games go for the more outlandish approach to open-world gameplay design. Whereas RDR2 went down the ultra-realism route of "look how painful & difficult it was to live in those times!" which whilst interesting to play...becomes a slog when you only have short periods of time to play.
                That’s fair but I will die on the hill that rdr2 is a top game of all time.
                > which whilst interesting to play...becomes a slog when you only have short periods of time to play.

Never felt that way to me. I could've played forever.
                > which whilst interesting to play...becomes a slog when you only have short periods of time to play.

Honestly RDR2 might be the slowest game, that doesn't feel like a slog at all. I could have played that game for another 200 hours if there was something to do. Very very relaxing game.

But tbh, Rockstar's approach of any of these "realism" things is always fake as fuck. You never needed to worry about eating, warm, or anything like that. They're honestly like genuine role playing mechanics, easy to ignore, but if you wish to play grizzled country cowboy, you can.
                I am in the minority, I prefer the "realistic" gameplay of Red Dead if compared to the moon physiques of GTA. In the end, it all depends if the traversal is fun, if the map is filled with interesting stuff, etc.. for example, I did not liked how Rocksteady announced Arkham Knight will have 3x the size of Arkham City, they will include the batmobile as the novelty, etc.. in the end, Arkham Knight has a boring map and the excess of batmobile can be annoying, the bloated size did not helped that game imo (and Arkham Origins suffers even more on this regard). 

And I am excited to play Horizon 2 on PC... but I hope this game will be just slightly bigger than the original, the traversal in Horizon can feel like a slog sometimes, the devs have to exercise some parsimony, sometimes less is more... Tears of the Kingdom is another example, the "depths" are just so fucking boring! First time you enter the "depths", it's amazing, scary, etc.. but when you go there for the 10th time... or even worse, if you are actually trying to unlock every "light tree" to reveal the whole map, it's a goddamn slog, way worse than Red Dead 2 or any other open world game I've played tbh
        I agree. It’s still fun and charming but after 25 hours i shelved it.
        Agreed, I'm getting bored of these quantity over quality open world games. Give me a few dense, well-crafted areas over a big ass map that I'll just end up flying over.
    > Tenth cave in a row that’s a straight path to a chest with redundant gear.

Honestly, I'm just tired of games filling themselves up with rng loot and vendor-trash. One of the things I really appreciated about Jedi Survivor was that all the chests were either cosmetics, or tokens to unlock cosmetics. So you didn't feel compelled to get them if you were buzzing through the story, but also you knew that whatever you were getting was unique and new. 

Some games, it's fine for, but anything following a Ubisoft Formula Open World doesn't at all.
        Jedi Survivor really impressed me with that - I was really disappointed with that aspect of JFO (though I loved it overall) so it was nice to see Respawn take the criticism to heart and greatly improve the variety of cosmetics and stuff. 

I think a Hogwarts 2 should make regular chests cosmetic gear only and then have set loot "artifact" pieces of gear in bespoke, handcrafted dungeons. Make those pieces have specific quests or legends associated with them, like maybe you hear about an ancient wizard that lost his magical locket in a cave. Then you KNOW when you seek it out or happen across it during exploration that it's going to give you a really unique buff or ability and not just "+10% chomping cabbage damage" or whatever.
    Absolutely agreed.

The game should have been HUGELY trimmed down. Ditch 95% of the world and just keep hogwarts, hogsmeade, forbidden forest and maybe the train station and like 1 village and focus all your efforts in to those elements. Ditch all the padding regarding the open world and just focus on the exploration and magic of hogwarts and the harry potter IP itself. Shorten the game like 33-50% and multiply the social aspect of going to school and interacting with your classmates by 5 times (hello persona has been around for decades you can take inspiration or just copy).

Still, it definitely isnt a terrible game. Just in the 6-8 range depending on what you prefer in your open world ventures.
        > multiply the social aspect of going to school and interacting with your classmates by 5 times (hello persona has been around for decades you can take inspiration or just copy).

Bully too, while Bully wasn't in depth in terms of classmate interaction.

You literally had to go to school in that game, you had to be at your first class by a certain time or you were truant. You could fail classes.

I was a little disappointed seeing such a fleshed out Hogwarts interior, only for it, to not really be used.
    This was my feeling as well, and that high fell off pretty quickly after I stopped exploring Hogwarts and started venturing into the broader open world.

The open world, many of the side quests, and the combat are just very generic.

I could absolutely see how if a reviewer basically explored Hogwarts and then speed rushed through the main quest and ignored most of the content outside of the castle, they might come away with a positive impression after 12-15 hours of gameplay.
        Lore wise it felt kind of hamfisted too. The books and movies seem like Hogwarts is well hidden and isolated from pretty much everywhere but Hogsmeade, yet in this game its surrounded for miles by bustling wizarding villages and hamlets. 

Maybe the time difference in setting would explain it but it still doesn't seem right
            I don’t think it really contradicts much, the villages shown in the game are all quite small. It seems reasonable to me that there would be other wizards living out away from muggle civilization.
            On the whole country, the area we explore is still very small, it's the outskirts of Hogwarts which are without Muggles so it makes sense wizards are installed there (though why they aren't all at Hogsmeade is kind of weird, it's not like it's so huge you can't find room anymore...)
        Agree except the combat, I don't feel like it was very generic. Sure it had the Arkham button counter system but you could mix and match your spells to good effect, making some creative combos, and the enemies even had weak points like pulling the frog's tongue out with a specific spell etc. It was probably one of the best parts of the game. 

The only thing is the loot system and enemy variety betrayed it, in a sequel with actual meaningful gear traits you could have much more build flexibility and way cooler spell augments that would give even more variety on top of more enemies to fight.
    >hope their next game they take a harder look at some of the mechanics for the open world

WB wants to make all their games live service, or at least their highest performing franchises. Hogwarts Legacy could potentially be a victim, next game might be microtransaction hell if it happens
    This is the exact take I had. They really did do an amazing job nailing the Harry Potter aesthetic, especially the castle itself. But the game itself is really just very basic open world fetch quest shit. The combat has potential, but as it is, it’s just a color matching simulator, and the actual unique use of most of the spells doesn’t really matter, as long as you pop them shields. The areas outside the castle and hogsmeade were pretty bland overall. The story was semi enjoyable and a few of the other parts of the game, like the room of requirement were actually fairly charming, but the moment I beat the main story, I turned it off and never thought about it again. It just had no holding power at all
You have to like Harry Potter or else it's a generic Ubisoft game. Hogwarts Castle and Hogsmeade are 8/10 at minimum, easily the best rendition ever and I spent close to 20 hours just running around exploring. Flying on a broom around the towers of the castle is literally a childhood dream come true. Everything else is 5/10-ish generic Ubisoft open world collect-a-thon.

Honorable mention to the combat for being decently well thought out and fun (imo). For anyone playing the game I recommend turning off the minimap and quest markers entirely; it enhances the feeling of discovery a lot.
    Honestly if the map was limited to Hogwarts and Hogsmeade I think it would be a better game for me personally. Not everything has to be this huge open world, especially when it’s filled with a bunch of nothing.
        Yeah the thing is that the game outstayed its welcome and I have a dozen memories of amazing moments in hogwarts and hogsmeade and remember like nothing about the rest of the game. Because of everything else, the combat which started amazing gets stale.

I feel like it was padded as an afterthought to give you more to do with the broom and flying beasts, but it’s unnecessary. If they lost most of that stuff, and instead added quidditch and let you floo powder to diagon alley, it would be an almost perfect game.
    I don't think you really need to be a Harry Potter fan to enjoy stuff like exploring Hogwarts/Hogsmeade and flying around on a broom.

That's all still part of the gameplay and doesn't really have anything to do with the Ubisoft formula.
        The only Harry Potter stuff I've interacted with was watching Deathly Hallows 2 with some friends in a theater, but I still thoroughly enjoyed Hogwarts Legacy.
    What do people even mean by generic Ubisoft game these days? Because I agree the game feels very generic but it's nothing like a Ubisoft game. I think this term has just become the new lazy criticism of any mediocre open world game.
        Ubisoft kinda made that template for gameplay though. 

This game is a toolbox of rpg mechanics. 
-talent tree
-crafting 
-collecting
-gear with rarity and upgrades
-challenges
-exploring rewards
-fetch quests
-leveling
-cosmetics
-good and evil story choices

Ubisoft gets called out a lot because they’ve been using this toolbox approach for a long time. The criticism is that they should focus more on quality and not quantity, instead of doing a presenting a toll box of rpg mechanics under a licensed IP. They didn’t create something new and innovative. 

 I still love it though! It scratches all the mental ticks for rpg players.
            [deleted]
                I don't know how the last three or so years have led from the Ubisoft Formula meaning "climbing towers, clearing outposts, unlocking chunks of the map, collect 100 doodads, etc." and has become "anything that is an open world action RPG."
            Ubisoft just has two series that follow it which is the same as other publishers regularly doing those games. 

I mean people are clamoring for Horizon, Spider-Man or Ghost of Tsushima for example (all from the same publisher). They're following that exact same formula. The Witcher 3 or Cyberpunk are praised as masterpieces, they're doing that too. Skyrim did it too. Even GTA is kind of that (no gear but the Ubisoft open world thing is from even before AC got gear). 

There are more games following that formula not done by Ubisoft than by them. It's basically the open world template/genre, I'm not sure what people want. Even stuff like Elden Ring or Breath of the Wild just have a variation of it.
            You just described le 9/10 Reddit favorite Spider-Man 2
                I mean yes but Spider-Man 2 isn't bloated to hell. Its like 20-30 hours to do litteraly everything, MAX.
        This. Ubisoft formula is a thing because it works. It is up to the individual game whether or not they pull it off well and make each reptitive experience still feel engaging and unique.
            How do people still not get this?

Ubisoft has been selling games and making bank for 15 years using this formula. And dozens of other studios used it well and made bank too.

Its like complaining about too many sitcoms in TV. Like, what?
                Remember folks, it's only a "Ubisoft-style game" if you don't like it!

That's why *Ghost of Tsushima* and *Horizon: Forbidden West* get a pass.
                    
Both of those games are frequently called Ubisoft games.

GoT ruined AC for me, because it's just AC without most of the Ubisoft game design garbage that infests their open world games.
                        Not going to lie but I got sick of GoTs foxes fairly quick.
                    Not to mention that the first Ubisoft-style game was Witcher 3 lol
                        It was AC1...
                It's the Reddit echo chamber vs the rest of the world, criticizing the Ubisoft formula is fair but one has to realize that 90% of people don't give a shit
                    Meh. Both Elden Ring and Breath of the Wild to a certain extent steered away from the traditional Ubisoft open world formula and people love those games all the more for it.
                        That has nothing to do with what I said. Ubisoft formula games consistently sell well because most gamers don't dislike the formula, even though you'd think most people do based on Reddit.
                            They don't sell as well as Elden Ring, BOTW, RDR2, GTA though.

It has a lot to do with what you said. The Ubisoft design formula isn't the biggest problem, but the phoned in lazy approach to these games does not generate the sales that the high quality open world games do.

They still sell well, but even Ubi doesn't report the actual sales data of mainline AC anymore. They now do revenue.
                                >They don't sell as well as Elden Ring, BOTW, RDR2, GTA though.

You're just moving the goalposts here. The formula is successful, that's my point, and saying it's not as successful as some of the best selling open world games doesn't change that.
                    >criticizing the Ubisoft formula is fair but one has to realize that 90% of people don't give a shit

So? Why is there a contingency of people on this website who think "This thing made a lot of money so you can't criticize it! You're just a stinky Redditor!" is some major own?
                        >This thing made a lot of money so you can't criticize it!

I literally said, and I quote, "criticizing the Ubisoft formula is fair", in my comment.

If you can't read maybe don't go on forums?
                            And yet you immediately follow that sentence uo with, to paraphrase 'lol who gives a shit'.
                                That's not a paraphrase, that's a strawman.

I said 90% of people don't care, because we were talking about how much criticism the formula gets on Reddit yet how successful it seems to be.

Once again, if you can't read then don't go on forums.
                                    You're expanding on what you said, not quoting yourself. It'd be useful for you to actually know what a paraphrase in this scenario is, huh?

Oh the irony of chastising someone for not reading while flat out having to concede you did not articulate yourself well enough the first go-around.
                Also its not like Ubisoft did suddenly bring this concept up and now everyone uses it. 


This formula has been going for decades and just gets more and more expended. 


Even in games like Gothic 1 and 2 you can find plenty of game play elements that are associated with today's "generic Ubisoft Title".


Basically all open world games have always lived and worked with the same patterns for like 25 years now.
                A lot of reddit commenters are insecure children who don't feel like they should like what's popular. Everything has to be counter to the culture in order to feel special and unique.
                The "Ubisoft formula" is basically the open world game design lol. Literally every open world game follow that formula with more or less variation on it (yes even Elden Ring or Breath of the Wild do)
                    Nah that's GTA3 or even Mario 64 design.

Many open world games don't have any Ubisoft design philosophy in them.

Ubisoft design is specifically the defeat the copy/paste base > climb the tower gameplay loop they made in AC and Far Cry. That's what people mean.

BOTW and Elden Ring of course both do this. But plenty do not.
        I actually just beat the game recently and I thought to myself, would I recommend this to someone who is not a Harry Potter fan? And I said no. The game itself is pretty mediocre but serviceable enough if you like the wizarding world.

But to answer your question about generic ubisoft game, to me this is basically open world filled with cookie cutter map marker objectives. So they made a huge map, but filled it with boring content like merlin trials, raid/poacher camps, broom balloons, butterfly chests, ancient magic thing, and whatever else was on there. I like the content in the game to be unique enough so that I never feel like its repetitive. Most games just go overboard and do this like any assassins creed and far cry. Even popular games like witcher 3 and spiderman. The one game I think did it pretty great was ghost of tsushima, it didn't feel like it over stayed its welcome and that is a bit ironic since its basically the assassins creed game ubisoft wished it could make.
        This game is so much fucking better than an ubisoft game. Those games are immediately boring and repetitive, 100% filler. Hogwarts was outstanding and breathtaking for like the first 20 hours, and then was padded with some open world stuff. But I can’t even play the crap Ubisoft puts out, from the start.
    Even if you are a Harry Potter fan... the games story is horrible. The writing and dialogue delivery really is quite poor and laughable at times. Once that initial charm wears off you're left with a pretty average experience.
    Honestly I think the LEGO Harry Potter games did a better job at capturing the vibe of Hogwarts better than this game did. You get more magic in either LEGO game than you do in HL at any rate.
    I’ve never read a single word of the books or seen one second of the movies and I loved the game.  lol

I actually just finished replaying it. 

I loved it just as much the second time. 

But I also love Ubisoft games so I guess it’s just my type of game.
Really liked the beginning but once they open up the second big map, it just became this chore that I didn't want to fuck with anymore.
    Yeah, I would say I loved it for about 20 hours but never picked it up again. 

The next game needs to focus so much more on content inside of Hogwarts. The castle itself might be the most beautiful video game area I've ever experienced. The lighting was insane on the PS5 and the interiors felt so real. Some of my fondest gaming memories of the last year was turning off all HUD elements and walking around the castle at night memorizing its layout. 

But the game needed to focus more on the fact that you're a student. There should have been people stopping you from walking around freely at night. It shouldn't have been so easy to access every part of the castle without having to slowly unlock new areas. The game starts you in your room, but that room never matters later. What house your in plays no part at all, which felt really weird. I was hoping thered be at least some reason to return to your commons. They spent so much energy making them completely gorgeous, but with nothing to do in them.
        Before launch, I thought (hoped?) the game might adopt some more Persona-esque mechanics. Not necessarily the dating sim/friendship stuff, but moreso the daily schedule and gradual unlocking of the player space.

I get why a studio would deliberately NOT want to restrict the player from *Hogwarts*.  Content gating for such a mass-appeal IP seems risky, but given a lot of Potter-heads are also readers who have the patience for story buildup, I think the devs could have exercised a bit of restraint in that regard.

Now that Hogwarts Legacy is the way that it is, the cat’s probably out of the bag on giving another Hogwarts game that structure.
            That would have been great if they went the persona route. It would have made more sense imo
        My biggest issue came when I noticed how much time I was spending in menus vs. in the game itself. Once I unlocked enough fast travel points the game loop became:  
1. Open quest log  
2. Select find on map and fast travel
3. Walk 2 minutes and do the same 4 spells  
  
I sort of want to try playing again but severely limit how much I fast travel.
        Potions felt so lacking.  Like there wasnt this interaction to make them more potent or anything.  Just toss some shit into a magical crockpot
        Yeah, it would have been cool with a Bully-esque game design. Make it feel more Hogwarts oriented with exploration on your free time.
    They didn’t realize that fans would’ve rather had things to do in Hogwarts itself than more open world. The Harry Potter fantasy is being a student in Hogwarts
I really wish they would have just ditched the open world and kept it to Hogwarts/Hogsmeade. 

&#x200B;

Also I suppose this is hard to avoid, but the game was fairly ridiculous in terms of some of the stuff it asks you to do versus the thought of a student doing it. "Challenge: Burn an enemy alive while torturing it with Crucio!" and stuff like that
    "Challenge: Brutally kill thousands of death eaters across the scottish highlands"
    I mean after I got them, I felt there wasnt much point in not using the dark arts.

They did succeed by making a boss fight end once I hit him with an AK.
        Whoa you found the AK? I only got the shotgun, any tips?
            Automat Kalashnikova! 🪄
                In Soviet Russia Dark Arts use you.
            If you didnt have to use the AK, today was a good day.
    Yeah I think a linear game with focused stories and subplots would make this game a lot more enjoyable.
    Yeah ditch the open world and any of the 'features' involved with it imo (such as all the meaningless collectathon shit). Focus on the school and hogsmeade, add a bunch more student life and opportunities for role-play. Make it a 'choices matter' game with incentive to replay as a different house. That would be my perfect HP game.
    To be fair it's kind of a limitation of the franchise. 

A student is not supposed to do any violent thing. When Harry and co did combat, it was to defend themselves from dark wizards attacking them and even then, they were never killing. 

But it would be kind of weird to have a video game with barely any combat.
        Generally I agree, but I'm kind of on the other side with this game. I've had a few (admittedly short) play sessions where I was just exploring the castle, talking to people, and doing side jobs, and it was pretty much fine.

If they really leaned into the immersive sim side of magic it could be really good. There are some parts of Baldur's Gate 3 where just figuring out all the interactions you can do is fun by itself. That's the real thing that drew people to the Harry Potter universe, there's barely any fighting in the first few books/movies.
            I did think a lot of what could a Harry Potter CRPG in the vein of BG3 be when playing it (the posh accent of the MC and him mentioning a Bag of Holding so many times did contribute to it lol). It could certainly be interesting and probably not that limiting for the general audience when you see how big BG3 is (it does need that AAA presentation but easy to justify for the HP license).

But on an action adventure game, I think bypassing combat or severely limiting it would be hard. They certainly could have reduced the copy paste content just increasing the duration for more combat though.
        They could have brough boss fights of magical means within the Hogwarts castle. And removing the entire HP of an enemy don't necessarily need to be a death. If they wanted, they could have surely made an appropriate game specifically for a student life. Problem is simply with the creativity of the developers of this game. All they have done is conduct basic study of other open world RPG games (only basic study, not thorough) and have implemented those mechanics pertaining to HP world.
Like others have said, once the nostalgia glasses came off, it was an incredibly mediocre game. 

I really wished they had gone the school sim / persona-esque route, rather than generic open world. You hardly feel like a student, but rather an undercover auror stationed at hogwarts, who never goes to class and occasionally pops into hogwarts.

what they could have done is go the more persona route, where you actually have days and classes you attend, classmates you actually have a connection with, tests to prepare for, all while balancing the actual story. Its quintessential harry potter. I think a lot of people may have thought thats what the game was going to be. 

but instead its so generic that it obviously felt like it was desgined by committee to be as approachable as possible to reach the widest audience as possible to make as much money as possible. which it did. so what do i know
    That seems to be the general consensus and I also agree. The Hogwarts part is amazing but the open world completely dilutes the experience in the later parts of the game. It would have been much better and more interesting if they would have shrunk down the gameworld considerably to just Hogwarts and make an open castle wizard school simulator out of it.

That being said I still really liked my time with the game, it was well made. But I hope they use the assets they've made for this game to create a smaller school sim game that only focuses on all the nooks and crannies of Hogwarts and tells a more down to earth story vs the end of the world shenanigans of Hogwarts legacy.
    A Bully style HP game is something I need
    Totally agree. I really would have enjoyed a years long school life sim at Hogwarts. Game doesn't need to be open world like GTA.
Some of the core Harry Potter elements are just amazing. The castle in particular of course: the scale, the scope, the secrets, the liveliness. Hogsmeade as well is excellent. The number of spells is great. 

Some parts were simply under-developed and *could have* been incredible: classes, Houses (and common rooms), relationships. 

And then a lot was mediocre - the breadth of an empty-ish open world, repetitive dungeons and quests, some tedious side content etc.

I'd love to see them build on the bones with a more "Hogwarts simulator" direction
Once you leave Hogwarts, the game's quality declines drastically. The castle itself is incredibly well realized, the world outside is far more generic and far less memorable, just one long checklist of locations, sidequests, and collectibles. Basically your average Ubisoft open world. I wish the game had been designed as a tighter, more focused experienced centered solely on Hogwarts itself. Something more akin to Bully, like with an actual class schedule and such. I liked the combat though.
    I remember the arguments for and against it being a 'school simulator' before release. Turns out Hogwarts was the only real positive of the game and it would have been far better off as such.
        100%, would have been far more compelling to keep the gameplay more contained and the story smaller scale instead of making you out to be some proto-Harry Potter savior of the wizarding world.
It coasted on nostalgia. The actual mechanics of the game felt really dated, like an action RPG from 2010. Which isn't *bad* unto itself, but in our current time with all the options available, the game's limits really start to stick out.

Take off the licensed IP veneer and it's a completely forgettable game that comes late to the genre without offering anything really new or interesting. If you're someone for whom the IP doesn't resonate or you've left it behind for other reasons, then Hogwarts Legacy is... just some game.
    This kind of criticism is pretty dumb. For example, take Ghost of Tsushima away from japan and samurais and its a completely generic ubisoft open world game. You cant just strip away the setting and style from the game...
        isn't the combat in that game more unique than the combat in any Ubisoft game ever, though?
            It's more refined and generally better, but I don't see how it's unique outside of the duels (which is admittedly cool)
        It's a refined Ubisoft game with excellent combat without the setting.
            rock paper scissors match stance to enemy type and hit the same few buttons is excellent combat? lol. a lot of style with hardly any depth. also the stealth is far worse than assassin's creed games.
    right but it wasn’t made for randos, it was made for people who enjoy the universe. people have bizarre expectations for games, you aren’t getting sekiro in a harry potter universe lol

it’s a childrens series so the game is not going to be overly complex. they did a phenomenal job for an inexperienced studio and it sold extremely well. if the sequel is the exact same, then bring out the pitchforks but there are practical considerations they had to take that led to the game being what it was - a fine, forgettable experience
        Who the hell wants Sekiro, people wanted mechanics that even the first Harry Potter games had.

Or mechanics from Persona or Bully. Other kids games.
        Mario and Zelda are kids games and there’s almost always have compelling and often novel game play. Just cause something isn’t “for gamers” doesn’t mean it has to be bland.
    > Take off the licensed IP veneer and it's a completely forgettable game that comes late to the genre without offering anything really new or interesting

You could say the same about like 95% of games especially in the AAA open world genre. The setting is a big part of people enjoyment of a game. 

Spider-Man is enjoyable because it's Spider-Man. Take it off and you got a generic open world game like we got dozens every year for 15 years easily.
    >  If you're someone for whom the IP doesn't resonate or you've left it behind for other reasons, then Hogwarts Legacy is... just some game.

but it was made for fans, and it succeeded tremendously on that, why judge it on something it wasnt aiming for
        Because people who aren't Harry Potter fans want to know if It's a good game on It's own merits, or just a good Harry Potter fanservice game.

I get people want to defend it, but as someone who has cursory interest in the game, but am only familiar with Harry Potter from blurry memories watching the films as a kid, posts like the ones I'm seeing in this thread are helpful.

It probably succeeds at giving Harry Potter fans what they want, but if once divorced from It's IP it can't hold up to scrutiny, then a non-fan like me wouldn't want to play it.
        nothing says low quality like "it was made for the fans"
            now thats just dumb af
                "it was made for the fans" tells me there's nothing going on in it aside from the parts where you recognize a thing and start clapping like a seal.
I consider it an otherwise rather generic open world formula, but imo uplifted by an impressive attention to detail, and an amazing amount of care for the world it portrays.

The sheer amount of detail that went into bringing Hogwarts to life deserves all the possible praise. Hogwarts itself is a magical labyrinth of hallways, rooms and staircases, with things going on every step along the way. I often found myself just observing whatever's happening in some random hallway. It can't be overstated how well done it is. After 11hrs I thought I had a good grip on it but got utterly lost in an entirely new area. Seriously: It is INSANE. And on top of that there's the plethora of locked doors everywhere you gradually get to open....

The countryside and the Hamlets are designed beautifully. Probably THE most beautiful game I've played to date. And the world is designed very naturally/realistically too. It is a joy to explore throughout the game. First time I was riding a broom I was smiling from ear to ear.

Not just the detail in regards to the source material, but the general flow and pacing do elevate it above the genre competition for me. It is just put well together. Despite that, it IS getting exhausting at one point, as open world games tend to do. Imo, they could've cut 50% of the countryside and focus more on Hogwarts and the Forbidden Forest.

The combat is better than I thought it would be. Think of Arkham combat, only ranged. But the spell combination effects, the blocking/parrying of enemy spells, breaking enemies protection based on colour, are done so well it never got boring. You're constantly on the lookout for opportunities to exploit specific weaknesses. Like giant frogs' tongues hanging out to hoist them up with levioso, or stopping an Animagi right as they're about to transform.

I do wish there were more differences between the houses. Unlike the books/movies you spend your time and quests with an NPC pool consisting of students from all houses. And aside from your common room or one single main quest, there's no real differences at all. Even narratively. I'm not saying everyone in Slytherin should be a dick, but the total absence of such, and everyone being super likeable is a bit disappointing. Only character who even mentions pure-bloods is of course totally against the notion himself.

YOU however, can be a real asshole in this game. Solving a puzzle for a Hufflepuff student, I simply refused to tell her the solution, saying if she were supposed to know the answer, she would've had solved it herself. Retrieving a student's gobstones that were stolen by bullies, I simply kept them for myself, saying it'll teach her a valuable lesson. My journey through Hogwarts left students walking the hallways, muttering to themselves how they should've never trusted me. Every sidequest gives you the option to either just be an asshole, or at least demand a little extra money for your troubles.

The equipment system is something I'm torn on. You can transmog everything from the get-go. Its nice but also means that once you're set on your look, everything you find is just numbers. Pushing me to use ugly gear if I want high numbers is something I usually hate, but here, I missed it.

The story is your typical video game story with all the typical twists and turns. Its quite forgettable tbh. This game lives entirely off its world and side-content. The NPCs are nothing special but its nice seeing that a lie you told several conversations(and hours) back in a dialogue choice, is mentioned again even just casually. A student showing up as an opponent at the Duel minigame, when meeting her for real for the first time, actually mentions that you've met at the Duels before. It clicks together.

The only thing I hate in this game, is the navigational map. Can't turn it, the zooming and display of icons is all weird so you never know where something really is. Even the player cursor is not 100% accurate, showing me standing besides a road in the woods when I'm actually on said road.

Two things I've seen people criticize are classes and house points. I think both are managed well actually. Classes are simply places you go to to learn spells. They're short and work well to not keep the player from adventuring. If you expect Persona-esque classes you'll be disappointed. House Points are mentioned by teachers but there's no real tracking system in place. I do think a system would be either too restrictive(can do things only once, as to not cheese) or outright broken in favor of the player anyway. So keeping it story relevant without actual influence was a good choice.

PC performance is surprisingly good. After hearing this game is very demanding, I was positively surprised by getting 60FPS flat with a R5 5600X/Radeon 6700/16GB on a mix between high/ultra with Ray Tracing off. Despite the game's benchmark putting everything on medium.

I'm not a Harry Potter fan. But if the books and movies count as "comfort media" for people that they love to get comfy on the couch to, then this is the perfect game to accompany that. I'm tired of the open world formula but I did love engaging in this magical little world for the 60 or so hours it took me to get through.
Critical 7/10, fan biased 9/10.

Exploring the world and interacting with everything was more than enough to carry through when gameplay wise it got a bit samey.

Great foundations for a sequel.
Overall, I'd say it firmly falls at a solid 7/10 for me. About as good of an introduction to a new game series as you can hope for from a game dev who had 0 experience in the genre this game is built around.

Everything about it *mostly* captured the magic of the HP IP but fell very short in too many areas to ignore. The gameplay was fun enough but became repetitive *wayyyyy* too quickly. Once you're done exploring Hogwarts there really isn't much left around the world to do. There's a few side quests and creatures to find but again, its just more repeats of things you already did before.

The characters, however, I found to be excellent. The writing for the narrative, while fairly simple and obvious, was fine for a first entry. Dialogue was fun to listen to while you ran around rooms/hallways. And Hogwarts, itself, was visually quite appealing and easy to navigate. However, again as mentioned above, it felt like a lot of the "secrets of Hogwarts" were the same brand of car just painted a different color while telling you "well no, its *different*".

Where I felt glaring flaws, aside from repetitive quests, was a feeling of... blandness in the gameplay. The spells you get are cool and can combo chain into fun combat stuff but again there was so many other spells they could've added or came up with to enhance the combat.

The gear progression was as barebones as you could get. I was really hoping for more in this area despite some cool cosmetic options. Spell augments, accessing new abilities with specific unique items, etc. would've made the game feel more deep in exploration and combat.

Enemies were *very* boring. I did not enjoy fighting nameless wizard and nameless goblin 1000 times. So many different things could've been splashed across enemy variety to spice things up but you can feel some restraints possibly put on them in this area.

Overall, I did enjoy my time with the game. I also see a very solid foundation for a sequel entry to expand on everything they laid the groundwork for. It has a lot of flaws so its just a matter if they can execute on the better concepts/gameplay they've built here in new, more depthly ways. Or will it just be more of the same "wide ocean, shallow depth" knowing it'll sell regardless?

I would definitely be willing to buy another entry in this game in hopes of them improving on it with the experience they now have. I do not regret buying this one and supporting their first endeavour. I hope we see more from this dev studio with HP.
It’s aggressively mediocre. Not outright terrible (though that stupid storyline doesn’t exactly leave me with any positive feelings on its own) but it does nothing impressive and there’s too many games that were out when it released that were better than it in every way, and especially a year later it’s completely dwarfed by most other major releases of 2023.
Its one of the very best games to just tune out and get lost in, Hogwarts and the surrounding country is just **that** beautiful. And I love, love, love the room of requirement.

That’s just my personal taste though. I agree with much of the criticisms.

What I will defend unto my death, however, is the **soundtrack**. I think it’s one of the single best soundtracks of any video game and on par with the movie score. If I want to be transported into the Harry Potter world, I will randomly listen to [**Mysteries of the cosmos**](https://youtu.be/PNSmf8u0e2A?si=Z16zHyno1OOVP2rL)

It’s my second favorite game of 2023 after Alan Wake 2
    I really wish they'd have gone more into the school stuff and less into the generic open world nonsense. Like cut it down to just the castle, forest, and hogsmeade. Drop the blandest chosen one main story. Remove room of requirements.
        I really wanted to move through the years, not start as a 5th year they somehow missed
            It honest never made much sense as to why they even picked the 5th year. Your first classes are you learning.... first year spells.
                And you only use transfiguration and potions in the RoR
    Yep, this is why I liked it. I've had a rough year mental health wise and I kinda just lost myself in the countryside getting to 100%. Was it mediocre? Probably yeah. Did I enjoy it? I loved it.
    People are really underselling how amazing Hogwarts Castle itself is. I can't think of a single other location in a video game that feels as much like an actual location.

Every other game has knee-high roadblocks, weird geometry with rooms being in impossible locations, building layouts that make no fucking sense, or fake doors that can't be opened and don't really exist. This doesn't really happen in Hogwarts, and it feels incredible.
    >Its one of the very best games to just tune out and get lost in, Hogwarts and the surrounding country is just **that** beautiful.

I agree. I understand the criticisms, but the charm and beauty of the game for a long time Harry Potter fan more than makes up for them. I didn't go in expecting 100+ hours of content, I just wanted a cozy game to return to Hogwarts and that's what we got.
    I can just zone out and grind Merlin trials and collecibles it’s kind of relaxing lol.  I could see where it’s a repetitive grind to people tho
    I agree with all your points. I understand why people don’t want the open world, but it’s also beautiful and detailed and great to just kind of fly around and zone out it. I feel like it’s gonna be a game that I just come back to every once in a while to walk around the castle, walk to Hogsmeade, do a lap around the map, and put down.
        I feel like I will treat it as that kind of game if only it isn't taking up 100gb of my disk space lol
As a licensed game? I would say its pretty good. The developers did a great job designing hogwarts and making people want to discover its secrets. I think they also did a great job of using the source material without being confined by it. Unlike Star Wars for example, which every game has to relate to the Star Wars main movies. 

I think my only complaint is how the school system was used. I get that they wanted to allow players a sense of freedom, as opposed to something like Persona. But, you really just do classes to get some skills and that’s about it. The cast was pretty forgettable outside of sebastian as well. 

Aside from that I think the developers have something good on their hands. Hopefully WB takes a step back and realizes they can do this with a wealth of IP’s instead of trying to force a live service.
    Which Star Wars movie was KOTOR based on? I'd like to see it.
        Id like to see which movie Tie Fighter was based on.
Up there with Mafia 3 as a textbook example of how to not make an open world game. The core gameplay was fun but you had to grind through so many mundane activities to actually do the main missions. 

The pacing and quest design were awful in places, including missions which were just go here and talk to X. 

And the story, truly awful outside of Sebastian. Lots of characters with no edge.
I am repeating a lot of what others are saying, but the initial like ten hours were amazing. Seeing a world I enjoyed so much as a child realized and interactive was amazing.

However, I also think making it open world hurt it because there’s not much to do that’s interesting in it. I wonder if the story was more the focus it would have been better. I never finished it and I don’t think I’ll go back.
As many other have said the game is extremely front loaded. The amount of love and care put into Hogwarts itself (and Hogsmeade) is mesmerizing for any HP fan. The game also is mechanically very sound - the combat is fairly simplistic, but it does feel pretty good, the audiovisual feedback is great. Flying your broom is also satisfying and scratches that HP itch perfectly. The flying itself is solid. 

I do wonder if the game was originally meant to be more restrictive and smaller scale - there's a couple of story missions where you have to actually sneak around at night due to curfew - but outside of those like, 2 missions you can literally just be outside without any limitations. 

I definitely think the game would've been more to my liking if it was a tighter, more structured experience. I guess something more similiar to Bully or Persona. Having a giant open world and doing random quests for random characters, taking out bandit camps, etc is not terrible or anything, but once you start spending more time outside hogwarts than inside, well, it rapidly starts losing the initial magic that made the game feel unique from its contemporaries. The game has several elements where it feels like it would finally introduce some friction - some actual decision making, consequences to your actions - but turns out, no, nothing. The forbidden spells are another big thing after the lack of curfew or any sort of timekeeping. Running around the school casting Avada kedavra with no consequence is a bit.... ridiculous. 

For example, I thought the Persona structure could've worked quite well here  where during the day you attend classes and do some light questing and preparation for the night when you sneak out into the dungeons to take on monsters, an enemy faction or whatever. Instead of making a giant open world, just make smaller areas like Hogsmeade and focus on making cool, detailed dungeons. 

I also think the game's reward system is really poor - you earn/find random gear pieces faaar too often. And with how the gear pieces are basically all just boring stat increases, outside of the fashion aspects, they quickly start feeling incredibly dull. 

Overall, I still liked the game as a HP fan but it really does feel like a bit of a missed opportunity. But with how successful it was, I'm sure we'll get several other entries in this franchise, so who knows, the potential is definitely there, and the developers have proven their talent and ability.
I’m not a HP fan but the game world was highly immersive (obviously excluding the copy-paste open world filler nonsense). I was impressed with all of the unique tidbits of inanimate magical objects all having their own lore and character to them. Their inclusion made the world feel lively.

Story was decent but ultimately forgettable. I know there is politcal back and forth surrounding the game but no one actually cares about that conversation. 

Just looking at the game itself, it was a solid piece of media for an established IP. Not saying it was a top 10 game but having something like a big IP have a good game does a little bit to help make the case for 2023 being the best year of gaming ever
On one hand I completely forgot the game released in 2023 and on the other it was by far the most disappointing game this year that reviewers sold on me(especially ACG, his comment that the open world is on the level of RDR2 is still crazy nearly a year later).
    He actually said something about it approaching RDR2, not that it actually matches it. That being said, I kind of agree. Just walking around the open world is extremely compelling, even if there is nothing to find. Which is also a problem that RDR2 has, by the way.
Terrible UX and underbaked everywhere from content to story. I think the only things they kinda got right were the aesthetic and the combat. And genuinely,  the lego games and PS2 games were better representations of hogwarts and the secrets you could uncover. I think they should have scaled the game back and focused more on the school itself and maybe made it a little more slice of life with some level of dungeon crawling from the school exploration. Unfortunately, they focus tested it and as a result it's probably my biggest disappointment of 2023

Edit: I wanna add this onto the UX, what were they thinking with the map? Number one: why the 5 second animation everytime you load it? It wastes time and you can't skip it. Number two: why make it 3D and only show the outside of the castle? The devs know the castle is a labrynth, right? They even had the opportunity to go aesthetic and give us a marauders map paper map to give us a good top level view so we could figure it out. Really bizarre they didn't think to make the whole thing actually legible when a big part of the game is the bigass castle with a lot of interior level design
    > Terrible UX

Mouse cursors on analog sticks are truly awful
Completely forgot I bought this game. I got swamped with work and mental health issues over the year and it just wasn't the game for me at the time.


I reckon I'll get back into it and finish it this year because I was having fun with it for time I played.
I started it a week ago and am liking it a lot 9/10.  Will get platinum.  Yes it has some basic open world filler but I don’t mind.  Story and world is cool.
too much bullcrap to collect, some of which gets introduced only in like the middle of the game(?) so you need to go back. it's like a game for non-gamer Potter fans they want to play this and nothing but this. no meaningful choices.
I'll preface this by saying that I don't like Harry Potter at all. I thought the game was pretty cool tbh. Its way too bloated and repetitive but I've put in about 20 hours and enjoyed it. I still go back and chip away every few months
I play a open-world action-RPG every few years, and this was the first one I played since AC:Odyssey. I think it was a solid 8.5/10. The combat was good, the setting was beautiful, the story was engaging, it just got a little repetitive in the last third or so.
I really liked it. It was a very cozy 30-40 hour adventure. The game was beautiful looking and you can tell that a lot of love went into Hogwarts and the town with all the shops. The combat was good, but it wasn't perfect. I mostly enjoyed collecting the clothes and all the things to decorate your room etc.
Enjoyed my time with it. The open world was pretty bland but flying on a broom made it fun enough. I'm not even a big HP fan.
Only one fella in our friend group got it. Some other friends still really didn't care for Rowling and judged him a bit so he really made a thing about how much he loved it. 

But the hilarious thing is that our friend will also bang on over and over and over about how much they don't like Ubisoft style open world games. I asked him about Hogwarts like a month later and he changed the subject. Then  at the end of the year he had the neck to pretend he had beaten it so I checked his time on it and it was like 7 hours total. 

I suppose what I'm getting at here is that the culture war bullshit around this game became interminably tedious no matter how people engaged with it. This dude could have just admitted the game had a good start but gets formulaic quickly but instead he has to turn Legacy into some sort of libertarian cultural icon just so he doesn't have to admit that the Rowling haters ""got one"" on him.

Eh. It was okay. Nothing innovative, but it was pretty to look around the castle and was finally a decent not terrible game based on a franchise with immense nostalgia power. They just need to not design their open world games based on what Ubisoft does. But after I finished it, that was it. Kinda forgot it came out earlier this year.
It was exactly what I wanted. A decent Harry Potter game. However, I'm hoping they actually put time into the sequel and have numerous branching paths so every house isn't the same.
After the charm of exploring the castle and some of the outskirts wore off, it quickly became one of the most boring & generic games I’ve ever played. I made it up to the quest you get the broom and literally just stopped playing because I couldn’t take it anymore.
Very generic and uninteresting story. A lot of half baked mechanics. Classes were pointless. There is no need for the open world. Make it similar to God of Wars map, semi-open world, with more unique puzzles and exploration, rather than 100 generic ones. And why did I get better loot from a random chest I found on a street rather than a chest found by solving a more complex puzzle? I would now rate it a 6/10.
Idk what these people are talking about. I think the Harry Potter movies are good. But I’m not a mega fan. I adored this game though. The world was full of personality. The combat was unique. It can get repetitive but once you change from your go to spells it freshens it up. The room of requirement and it’s outdoor area is way more robust than the bare minimum. You have to make your own fun though. Which is why everyone seems to have fallen off of it in the later half. You don’t have to use all the spells or get into the more robust elements of the room of requirement but doing these things keep the game fresh. I loved it.
As someone who couldn’t care less about the HP world it’s one of the most overrated games of all time. It’s a perfectly mid game with extremely shallow systems
Extremely generic sandbox/open world game. Only the Harry Potter reskin is interesting if you are a fan... if you are not a fan, really, there's no reason to waste time with this game, there's so many great sand boxes out there from multiple generations. I still love the genre, I am upgrading my PC to play Horizon 2 and Tsushima eventually, but this Harry Potter game is a hard pass for me
    My experience with Horizon 2 is that it's great, it's huge, it has a lot to do...but it's *so* big with *so* much to do that just playing the game almost starts to feel grindy, even if nothing you're doing is particularly grindy on its own.  Kinda a weird feeling to have.
        Not really a unusual experience, sandboxes can get repetitive with time, it becomes a routine instead of just playing the game for fun. I heard the story of Horizon 2 is significantly worse if compared to the original, I take that with a grain of salt because a lot of people got upset with the supposed "woke" content, so who knows if the story is actually bad or it's just the outcry from social media bubbles... but I love the original so much, it made me upgrade the PC (little by little, I am a cheapskate, so I only bought refurbished or promotional stuff)... it's ironic really, a Sony game convincing a PC player to upgrade, you would never imagine such thing back in 2017ish. I actually played Tsushima on a friend's PS4, the game looks like Assassins Creed with a budget, but the japanese voice acting alone and the combat convinced me, I am sure Sony will release a PC port this year, there's so much money to be made
I found it enjoyable, I thought the combat system was really fun. Main story was fine with some solid stand out moments (third trail springs to mind), final boss was a nice set piece. I think the game shines with some of its character writing, I really liked Poppy & Sebastienside quests. Definitely worth your time if you're a fan of harry potter. You can tell the Devs had a lot of love for the HP franchise
It was as good as you could expect from a new studio, and some of the visuals were really neat. The combat was fun and stayed fun all the way through to the end, and without that I don't think it would've held me. 

I think it was a really good foundation for further games in the universe.
It's a really good game, but it falls a bit too much into open world tropes.  Lots of fetch quests and combat quests.  I had to pick between leaving it installed and finishing it or uninstalling for Baldur's Gate III, and I uninstalled.  Maybe I'll go back one day!  Lots to like about it.

All the people claiming it to be the best game of the year though were a riot.
I loved the game! I played it for a month and a half without putting it down and 100%/platinum-ed it. Its more than I could have hoped for and im glad it was made.

Its not an incredibly genre breaking or innovative but its rather a chill rpg-lite where the combat is satisfying and forces you to use the different skills and their mechanics in fun ways. All the moment to moment gameplay (traversal, puzzles, flying, combat, quests, vivarium) is satisfying and most importantly fun.

Obviously there are some things which could be improved upon, but it was really magical to explore hogwarts, finish puzzles and explore the rest of the world. I think the world was a bit too big, they could have spent that dev time on some other aspects of the world and there are one or two other criticisms i agree with and came to conclusion on my own but i think this game is a great stepping stone to a better more fleshed out sequel.

TLDR 8.5/10, most importantly had lots of fun with the game and platinumed it
Unsurprisingly, it was yet another formulaic open world snoozefest, but in a Harry Potter setting.

Take the HP out of it, nobody would care about the game at all.
The HP setting really protects it from its overall mediocrity tbh. Very very repetitive but I loved the combat overall. The story was also pretty meh outside of the Sallow side quest. Learning the unforgivable curses was awesome. As soon as I was done with the story I uninstalled. Got a solid 35 hours out of it and didn’t regret my purchase.
Glad to see this thread!

Overall I was very pleased with the game and it exceeded my expectations. A lot of the hype leading up to the release was well-deserved and I'm glad there weren't really many disappointments along the way. It wasn't ever GotY material, but I think it's worth experiencing even for people who aren't huge into Harry Potter. It's a fun game of wizardry, potions, and spells all taking place in a charming settings.

Everything around Hogwarts and Hogsmeade was spectacularly designed. Everything from the Great Hall to the classical music in the tower (Defense Against the Dark Arts?) was very fun to explore and take in. It really gave me a cozy feeling that I absolutely adore in games. I often found myself just walking around taking in the visuals and atmosphere; though after a while I noticed most of the NPCs were very static and had no interactions apart from the quest-specific ones. They would also just randomly pop-in depending on the time of day whereas I was hoping that each NPC would have some sort of scheduling that involved them moving between their classes, dorm room, great hall, etc. But for the most part they all just kinda appeared and stood still.

The whole southern half of the map, basically everything past the long cave, felt much less Harry Pottery to me and I started to get a little bored with the game once my adventure took me there. By that point, especially, I had discovered all the main mechanics of the game so I felt there wasn't really anything new to experience, and I just didn't really care for the aesthetic in that whole area of the game world. I much preferred exploring all the corridors and rooms in Hogwarts.
  
Combat was very well done, and I was genuinely surprised at the amount of depth in setting up and executing different spell combos. I can't say I ever got bored with the spellcasting and combat, and I enjoyed raiding the different enemy camps to hone in my dodging and parrying. Clearing a camp with zero damage taken was always possible and it was really fun to end a fight at full health with piles of ashes around me.
  
The XP system being tied to the guide felt good at first but eventually felt very grindy as I had to start hunting down well-hidden pages and other discoverables that were a bit of a pain. I also felt like there were a few too many Merlin Trials; even though there were 4 or 5 different minigames, it still felt very repetitive. However, completing the field guide did make me feeling like a straight A+ student, despite me getting very close to burn-out (thinking back to my undergrad days, +1 for realism!)

It's not a ubisoft game, are you sure this is the game you have?
I just recently finished the game a moth ago, and it was really fun. I loved how live action it looked, and a lot of the quests were really fun. I loved meeting the characters and meeting creatures. When I went to Walmart to see how much the game was, (because i think when the game came out on Nintendo switch it was almost $80) and it was $40! so i was like i have to get it now. I'm now starting a new story on the game and I'm like obsessed with the game.
I've recently started listening to the books and gotten back in the spirit. So I bought the game this last weekend and only been able to put a couple of hours in so far but I am thoroughly impressed. I love you have free reign of the castle. I'm a huge sandbox style game fan so this caters to all I like to do the map does look huge so that's a Plus that I'm not confined to the school grounds. Last time I played a Harry Potter game was Harry Potter and the Chamber of secrets on the ps2.
I'm completely disappointed by the makers of this game. They created such a great setting with great graphics and world. But they trully messed up the gameplay, main story and all the side stories of the game. All the critics who have praised this game obviously haven't played this game for more than 10 hours. Because for the earlier part the game delivers extremely good feelings. Problem starts later on when the game becomes rather generic and boring. The developers surely didn't have a single person in their team who had ever played a good Open world RPG game. They just checked the basics of other games and implemented the mechanics they thought would be good. Sadly, many things in this game don't work. Halfway into the game everything loses it's importance. Money becomes useless. Chests becomes useless. All the rewards becomes useless. In simple words, no reward is rewarding at all.   The fighting felt good early on, but later on you feel that the combos are not really good and u just master how to switch between all the abilities at different opponents very fast, not caring which one do what. I played the game on hard difficulty, and rarely I faced any challenge. Even the last boss fight felt rather easy on the Hard difficulty. The only potion felt useful was the health potion. Rest of all the potions and plants felt useless. Due to Rivelio most of the puzzles became rather simple. If they had kept rivelio solely associated for the drops/chests, rather than every clickable mechanism, the same puzzles could have become rather good. They also messed up big time with not keeping the game's focus on the Hogwarts but the world around it.

One more thing. Lots of people thing that picking different houses will give different gameplay. There is extremely negligible difference. The separate quests we are given for choosing different houses have a play time of somewhat like 5 minutes. I first played half game with Slytherine and did that house associated quest. Later I played Hufflepuff, for people praising the Azkeban questline. But the difference there was absolutely disappointing. No matter which house we choose all the side quests and character interactions are exactly same, and in same order.

For the first half of the game I will say it's 8/10. Second half is like 3/10. So I would rate the game mere 5.5/10. 6/10 if I'm feeling a bit generous here.
The setting is nice, everything else is trash.

But it's okay, I expected trash, never got hyped like everybody else
It's a great game, probably one of the best licensed games of all time, which is a lot to say since golden era of Disney games for SNES and Genesis. Maybe the Riddick game is still better?

Besides that, it's a decent game, almost bug free when it was released, and zero micro transactions. The gameplay loop is decent and it give a lot of respect to the Harry Potter brand.

That being said, it fell behind quickly as even better games got released that year. Also, as you said, it has this Ubisoft formula that is just plain boring. 

Still, it's the most bought game of 2023 and if is not just because the brand (otherwise games like Avengers would have had a similar success). Its success relies mostly on the quality of the game. Let's recognize that.

Because this game had some unjustified backlash that affected how the media portrayed this game, affected content creators who just wanted to share a good time with it, and probably affected the studio too, who felt forced to change the game in order to improve the PR of the game against this Social Justice audience that tried to boycott the game. Truly something that should be analized later. It affected the game later as despite of its popularity and good reviews, had little attention from the media during the period of game awards.
Pretty much as soon as you’re out of the tutorial the quality falls off a cliff. I see a lot of people call it mediocre but to me this game was pretty bad and i had to force myself to finish it because my friend wanted to talk about it.
It would’ve been nothing without the Harry Potter IP. Mechanically it’s even more shallow than the Ubisoft games.
As a non-Harry Potter fan, it was a mediocre third person shooter with meaningless combo mechanics and open world exploration baked in. Running around Hogwarts in the opening 10 hours was super fun and there was a lot to discover. Once the world opens up though, interacting with it is sooooo boring and the sense of discovery completely disappears. That's if you decide to interact at all instead of just flying over everything.

Ultimately, it sets itself up decently for a sequel, but they'll have to re-vamp a lot of the game from the ground up to pique my interest.

That being said, my non-gamer, Harry Potter degenerate wife loved the game and put 50 hours into it. Your mileage may vary haha.
30 mins in I was like, this is it?  This is what people are raving about?  It was a gorgeous world with no substance

I played for a while more just to make sure of course not sure what my playtime was but less than 2h so I could return it
At its heart, it’s a worse open world Assassin’s Creed with a giant IP doing the heavy lifting.

Needed better game direction but took the safe, by the numbers, option.
it's pretty funny how vehemently people defended this game at first thinking it should be GOTY and then looking back everyone is like oh it really was just an average to below average game in many ways lmao. fuck JK Rowling
A solid 6, maybe 7 out of 10 at best. Average, B-tier, whatever you want to call it. First half was great. Second half not so much. Story felt rushed near the end. Being a student is one thing but it also felt the story was limited due to that. Hogwarts was beautiful. It was amazing to explore it. The world and combat is repetitive, but it was still a really cool environment to explore. Hogsmeade was really neat. The music was really good. 

If anything, it's a good enough first game to start with and given the sales, hopefully its grounds for another game down the road. Can't say how a sequel should be improved upon, but I'd be excited if they did announce it. At the same time though, doing another game as a Hogwarts student can only do so much. Maybe if they had an actual endgame where you progress through the years and graduate into a working adult, that would be neat.
Beautiful world filled with horrible/repetitive Ubisoft Formula tasks and an absolutely boring but graphically beautiful combat system. Wound up avoiding combat as much as I could and then eventually getting bored before I beat it.

That said, I hope another one gets made and they improve on the weak points.
Started out kinda good then turned to shit right after the 2 hour mark. My biggest gaming regret of 2023
Very disappointing and clearly unfinished. What the hell was the point of breeding creatures?
Just finished it yesterday.

It's so streamlined, any fun was sucked out of it. It felt very much like a soulless Ubisoft game. I was like level 20 when I unlocked the skill tree, so I could basically fill out everything that mattered. Gear "system" is an absolute joke. 

"Puzzles" (if you can call it that) have 1 solution and 1 solution only. 
At that point they become busywork. A statue you need to cast levio on that is highlighted in your REVLIO crap? Oh what should I do? They should have been more like Zelda's puzzle and allow you to be creative.

The control scheme was also a mess imo. Scrolling through your spell pages was super clunky.

The only redeeming factor was that some aspects about the game tackled some very adult topics and running through Hogwarts was cool for a few hours.

I wish it would focus more on being a student and have a life-sim element that includes visiting classes, learning and unlocking new spells, increasing your stats through school activities etc.
Once the novelty of actually exploring an open-world Hogwarts wears off, it's a painfully average game. There's nothing I can really complain about, but nothing I can really go "Wow! This is amazing!"

It follows typical game design and lacks its own real identity.
Good high budget game, amazing level design and graphics, good campaign story and scenes, tons of puzzles and stuff to do, okay-ish combats, but it overstated its welcome for the open-world collectible side content at the end which was too much repetitive.

It's just sad that its popularity was arbitrarily boosted by a pretty much unrelated conservative led hate social media campaign.
I enjoy the game.

The main story quests are fine, what I hate is the assignments.

The people’s quests (Natty, Sebastian, Poppy) are also good, but they seem to pop up at random time, are they time locked?

I like that you can choose ending, what could make it better is you can already show your evil side during the game, so rather than become a dark wizard as ending you can become on during game play.

The broom is hard to control so the broom time trails are BS, especially the last one.

Oh and the Lv34 requirement to complete the game was BS too!!!!!

Good game I would say, just not a 10/10 masterpiece, but easily 7+ for me.
I enjoyed it quite a bit but I'm also a big Harry Potter fan.  Exploring Hogwarts and Hogsmeade was absolutely incredible.  But like most people are saying, outside of that it's mostly just a typical Ubisoft open world game with some HP flavor.

In a sequel I hope they focus more on student life.  Classes, interactions with students, the house cup, and honestly just spending more time within the castle.  Leaving the grounds and exploring the outside world is fun but it felt like you spent 95% of your time not actually in Hogwarts.  It feels like you're only really a student for the first bit of the game.  

And the map was too big.  I feel like at the very least that whole section south of coastal cavern was completely unnecessary.
I liked it! It was a 7/10 but that's still fun. The kinda game I woulda killed for back in the early 2010's before JKR went mad.
Setting, world and visuals are fantastic but as you say, they are carrying a very 6/10 game. As a lapsed HP fan I really enjoyed it but it was a very mid game and to anyone not into the franchise it was pretty poor.
Feels insane to go about mass murdering evil wizards as a school pupil. Either create an action game where we're already a grownup auror, or lean into actual "school life".

And why would anyone care if you kill someone using a fireball or a forbidden curse? It's like outlawing knife murders, but saying gun murders are just fine.
I liked it a lot. Wasn’t a master piece or anything, but was a solid open world game and nailed the feeling of Hogwarts. Had fun with the combat too, again nothing, great, but was more fun than I expected. Just need a bit stronger story, especially for side quests and more varied open world quests/activities. Sold a ton, so hopefully they can improve upon it in a sequel.
The game gives one of the best first impressions in recent memory. You start by soaring through the sky in a flying carriage, but then get shot down by a freakin' dragon or something. Then, during the tutorial, you have to solve an ancient mystery that soon takes you on a wild ride through a goblin vault. By the end of the tutorial, you learn that you have a special kind of magic that almost no one else in history has ever possessed.

Wonderful start!

You spend the early part of the game exploring Hogwarts, which is beautifully designed. Many sections of the school are loaded with interesting details and personality. It's clear that the school was built with a great deal of care and attention to detail.

However, the game loses its luster by the time you leave Hogwarts. The outside world is boring as shit. The hamlets are all samey, and so are the outdoor puzzles, fights, and other challenges. 

Hogwarts Legacy has a very strong opener, but after about 10 hours it gets boring.
My wife loved it as a Harry Potter fan and practically 100%'d it.

I am not so into HP so it didn't really resonate with me, though it was very pretty and fun to explore. 

I think if there was more lifesim class type stuff, like Persona type shit, I might have stuck with it longer. Also the broom felt slow.
I never finished it.  It was boring, with terrible quest design.  Sure it was cool to be in Hogwarts for all of maybe 3-5 hours, but once that novelty wore off all the cracks began to show.  The ridiculous busywork you had to do to unlock spells was a complete waste of a player's time.  The sidequests were no different than the worst of any Far Cry or Assassin's Creed drivel.  Also, did anyone notice that the Weasley character and Slytherin character who were both friends of the main character used the same character model?  I mean come on.
It was pretty fun, until I tried to complete the second broom challenge.  I spent many days on it, always barely missing the target time by 0.1 seconds.  I would have given up earlier, but I was so close to beating it that I thought it could be done if I played just a _little_ bit better.  Just cut one more corner, take one more line a little more tightly...that's all I needed to do, I thought.

And so I kept trying.  I tried so many times, those godawful flying controls actually started to feel slightly _intuitive_!  But even as I got better at the controls, my broom would still sometimes go haywire, as if the sensitivity were being jacked up to 100 for a spilt second before returning to normal.  I even tried switching controllers a few times, but my broom would still randomly decide to nosedive from time to time.  Was it just my imagination?  Was I just inventing excuses?  That had to be it.  Nobody would intentionally design a flying game that deliberately sabotaged your controls at random, would they?

On day 4, I took a break and decided to do a main story quest.  Immediately after I completed that quest, I got a notification from the broom seller...letting me know a new broom upgrade was ready.

...

...

I haven't played the game since.
Solid 6/10 or 7/10. 

Average predictable story

Interesting world design

The exploration was cool 

Issue was the traversal got boring and the combat was just average. 

Game was just fine. Finished it and haven’t thought about it since.
It was a super front loaded game. Hogwarts was amazing and I loved exploring it. Flying around the countryside was also really fun at first. However once you had your fill of that, everything else was just okay and the game didn’t have much else to offer.
I couldn't finish it. The game looked great, but once I dug in, it felt like I was playing a game that has been made a thousand times. The feeling was similar with that of Horizon: forbidden West, didn't finish that either. They aren't terrible games, but something about them just doesn't appeal to me anymore.
They *still* haven't fixed a game-breaking bug that halts progression of the main story: [https://hogwartslegacy.bugs.wbgames.com/bug/HL-851](https://hogwartslegacy.bugs.wbgames.com/bug/hl-851)
People dont consider that this is **Avalanche's first ever AAA and open world game**. Considering that, its a great first entry. Can't expect it to have all the features we want or 50 hours of content like games from seasoned AAA open world devs. Of course for the sequel I will have higher expectations, but I'm very happy with this first effort. 

The Hogwarts castle and surroudingly are amazingly recreated with great care and detail. Combat is pretty fun if u combine spells in proper ways. The creatures are wonderful, flying on them and breeding them. And the music is great as expected after the movies. Decent enough story and there were some memorable characters. Its a solid 8-8.5/10 game for me.
According to Steam’s end of year metrics, Hogwarts Legacy was my longest played game this year. It was pretty fun and and I loved the setting and gameplay of it. As opposed to BG3 which I couldn’t stand more than 2 hours of without dying of boredom.
I think Hogwarts Legacy, along with Starfield, presents an object lesson in the Pre-launch hype->Early-launch honeymoon->Cold shower objective analysis cycle of game launches.

There is no worthwhile, perhaps even *possible* criticism of a majorly hyped title within the first couple weeks...and then after a month everyone sheepishly agrees about the obvious, glaring flaws that were evident a couple hours into the experience.
    I don't think we've reached Starfield's "cold shower objective analysis" yet, we're in a weird reverse-honeymoon period where people refuse to admit the game has redeeming qualities.
Repetitive af. 

Hire some fanfic writers and they'll write better sidequests and worldbuilding I swear.
It's very good overall with some pretty big open world issues. You can just feel the amount of care and love that the devs put into the world, characters, and details.

I think it's a must play for fans of Harry Potter, and everybody else can likely skip this one unless they have the urge to explore a magic school, which this one is very good.
It's 20% game and 80% filler lmao


Go 100% the game and tell me how you feel after 100 merlin trials, which are all the fucking same
My expectations were too high, I thought the story would be.. more. I was honestly hoping for a bioware style game with choices and stuff. The main story was so lame and nonsensical :(

The combat was super fun, though. I get the complaints about low enemy variety but it's not that bad. Turn the difficulty to hard and it was an amazing time.
Love HP, from everything we had seen it looked generic as hell and lazy in design across the board. played it briefly at a friends and confirmed my opinions.

Hogwarts is cool to explore but that’s about it. 

Rather then making a special game they made  mass appeal game. And the hour I played was enough to know I’d be too bored to finish it.
Tried it and lost interest half-way through. Wasn't that great of a game tbh forgot a fair bit of it even.
As a game its fine, as a pc port its terrible.

Audio from 1 ear, shite cpu workloads like in hogsmease, stutters. Atleast not in top 5 worst ports this year.
It's an alrighty first step. It need way more gameplay and interaction with the students.

The main story is awful, I hated the light donjon thing, it looked nothing like that potter content.

Also, I'm still mad about how bad the house choice by the hat is.

I believe it was a crazy popular game because it a lot of people who generally don't play game wanted to play it. There is bigger market than usual. But it was too generic and didn't simulate the school  life enough.

Hopefully the next one is better.
Front-loaded with a lot of nostalgia and wonder in its presentation but not much substance to the game itself and doesn't go anywhere interesting.
I played it for a week and then haven't touched it since. Like you said it's just open world game: another one, but with a shiny layer of paint.
Honestly I haven't played it partially out of fear that I'd be targeted for doing so, but also because I kinda went off of Harry Potter video games after playing  Chamber of Secrets two decades ago.

What soured my opinion of CoS specifically was that it was a poorly made stealth game thinly disguised as a Zelda clone. That becomes apparent from the moment you step into Diagon Alley. Most of the game involves you sneaking past perfects and teachers to progress and your success with this is largely what determines whether you win the House Cup for Gryffindor and get the good ending.

And by poorly made, I mean it. I spent hours stuck on the Magical Menagerie because I tried to play that part like a stealth section. Turns out you couldn't actually sneak past the shopkeeper because all his animals would alert him. The only way to progress is to literally leg it to the back room, grab Ginny's scales, get caught on leaving the room and then be able to finally get on with the story.

As for whether I'll buy Hogwarts Legacy now? I dunno. 50% off isn't enticing enough to play what is by all accounts a generic Ubisoft style sandbox game.
6/10 Enjoyable enough to get to the end of the story, but not really beyond that. Slow walking around the castle in the early to mid game was really the highlight for me. Everything else was just boring regular RPG. Really missed some more intricate school mechanics. The fact that your 'lessons' quickly devolve from actual classes to just finding and talking to a teacher kinda highlights the divergence from Hogwarts being presented as a school for me. Which is a shame.

At the end I was thinking about how forgettable the game is, and it is very true because I really could not remember anything of the story now until I looked it up.
To be honest - I didn't like it. Not like "I hate it", but ... It did not hook me up. I will try to give it another go when I have more free time. But I was expecting more from the game...
I still havent finished it. The performance was so utterly shit and stuttery it was unplayable.  
Not sure if patches have helped because i lost interest.
I got bored almost immediately when the plot left Hogwarts. There was a point where I had to go to some dungeon or cave and zombies first appear and I was like “what the hell is this?”.
I got bored and never finished it. I found the gameplay pretty dull, and the overall tone was way too twee for my taste.
When you start, it's magical. It feels amazing to explore what the school and town had to offer. But the longer you play, the more obvious the charade of it all is.

Every NPC is at the exact same spot doing the exact same thing through out every season, with changes made only during night/day cycles. They're there to fill in the empty space, but when they made everything felt alive the first time, it starts to feel more and more fake.

The quests as well felt very boring. The side quest regarding the Slytherin character was interesting, but other than that, I found the rest underwhelming. The main quest itself was decent, but not exactly impressive. Everything felt too convenient with how it ended up for your character, but the way it progressed felt like it was dragged a bit too much.

As for exploration, whilst Hogwarts itself had impressive areas, as did Hogsmede, it feels like a nicer looking but still boring open world. A lot of empty that you ignore, with pockets of events that happen at the same locations, made clear by the map. It was very plain despite looking pretty, and was honestly just empty, filled with chores more than anything. I also do not see the need for a broom and mount; one would have sufficed, and it added nothing for me.

Speaking of the map, it sucks. The line to follow is very useful when you highlight a quest marker, if not mandatory when you're not used to the layout. This is specifically for when within Hogwarts. It felt more complicated than it had to be.

Then we come to the combat, which as with everything else in this game felt good at the start, only to get very repetitive and boring by the end. It also makes no attempt to punish you for using the Cursed Spells at any point. I can literally execute people with the Killing Curse in front of my professor in a mandatory escort quest, and they don't blink an eye.

Unfortunately, the layouts for where combat takes place is also very boring. The sheer amount of things you can go out and kill is also quite insane, and it's always in a similar area. It's so weird how you're a new student, and yet you can commit genocide on the entire forest with relative ease, but yet they repopulate themselves the moment you look away. Gets tiring, you know?

Then you have annoying moments where you're told to get to a high point, but you have to do some stupid puzzle and climbing. I have a magic broom; let me fly up there. Or when in cutscenes with your character looking up, wondering how to get there. It's so stupid.

----

so the **tldr**: Magical and fun at the start, but it gets boring and annoying a few hours in, then by the end, it's similar to the pain of slogging through a typical Ubisoft game.

They honestly should have made a shorter, or at least smaller experience. They had the right ingredients and baked it decently enough, but for far too long for too large a cake.
20 dollar game posing as 60 dollar game. That being said, it was the best HP thematic game out there, but, the bar is low...
Meh - my reaction to this game in general is the kind of apathy you get when there's a cat asleep on your chest, and you need to be somewhere, but you don't want to disturb the cat

In a nutshell

Too many copy-pasted open-green fields 

Random loot systems made it difficult to *give a shit* about what I was grinding for

Not enough time in the school (which would be like selling Shadows of Mordor but you spend all the game in the Shire...) 

Combat was... ... ... certainly a thing

The most interesting part of the game was the various controversies it spawned - and even that had it's limits when it reached the point that it was just the various sides of the internet discourse monkey cages throwing feces at each other

Oh!

And the fact that it won the SteamDeckiest of SteamDeck games award - which is one of the few awards the company won this cycle, which is hilarious xD
The most mediocre game of the year. Once I realized most of the open world is just bandit camps I lost all hope. How am I supposed to take this seriously when a student is taking down adult criminals. I just wanted the regular student experience at Hogwarts, instead I got another chosen one story.
One of the biggest dissapointments of that year for me. I came in wanting to like it, and the first few hours of exploring Hogwarts and Hogsmeade was fun enough. But it became pretty quickly apparent that all of your interactions with those places are very surface level. Combat was fun enough but nothing to shake a stick at. The writing for the main quest was incredibly bland, I really tried to find some charcter or quest that would leave an actual impression but for the life of me I couldn't find it. When the story started sending you out of the castle more I just started playing Like a Dragon Ishin instead.

Honestly I find Rowling incredibly distatsteful but I kind of resent the people who made a big fuss about the game. Seems like it led to a lot of outlets putting there biggest Harry Potter fan on the review with the more potentially critical voices not reviewing it all just to avoid the mess. Or maybe I'm just stick in the mud idk, I just have no idea where those 9/10 reviews were coming from.
It starts out incredible. Exploring Hogwarts itself is fantastic to begin with. Finding all the little easter eggs is great for a fan of the books and movies. I like all the students and teachers (and I wish they all had more screentime. We could have used a couple of bully characters too. Everyone's too nice). Flying around on a broom is kind of fun. Sebastian's questline was easily the best part of the game for me.

Unfortunately, it gets boring *very* quickly. I didn't care for the gameplay at all. Having most spells boil down to three different types just discouraged the player from experimenting with different ones, even if specific spell combinations did do increased damage to specific enemy types. It was a mistake to have every unlockable be something cosmetic, like a new pair of glasses or a hat, rather than something that changes the gameplay. There are 95 Merlin Trials but only 9 different types and they're all environmental puzzles. Fortunately, the Room of Requirement and magical creatures ingredients aren't all that necessary but having them on a timer is mobile game design. Not being able to cast spells on other Hogwarts students makes the castle feel emptier. I also think it's nuts that we had a Hogwarts game without Quidditch in it. I know the rules don't make sense but they could have forced the player into the role of a Seeker if it would make it easier.

Also, this is more of a nitpick, but your avatar is the most bland, personality-less character I've ever played as. I know that some games with created characters don't want to make their personality too defined because they want the player to put themselves in the role but it just means I didn't care about them in the slightest. There's one section of the game where they take Polyjuice Potion and pretend to be the headmaster, then start cracking jokes and acting like a fool. But the problem is that the main character wasn't established as a Fred and George type of prankster, so it feels odd for them to suddenly act that way.

I didn't finish it. I don't remember exactly how far I got but I think I reached the final season. I just got given a side quest to capture a phoenix. Before it came out, I remember people wanting "Bully but set in Hogwarts". After playing the game, they *really* should have gone with that idea. Attending classes and interacting with other students was the most fun part of both games (and I actually think Bully gets worse once you explore outside the school too). Hogwarts Legacy should have beefed up the Hogwarts part of the game and got rid of most of the open world. The Hogwarts grounds, Hogsmeade and the Forbidden Forest would have been enough and they could expand each one a bit.
If it was called something generic like "School For Gifted Wizards" instead of being Harry Potter themed, the game would have died a death.

The initial back drop and "ooooo" is the ONLY pull the game has, and the actual game portion of the game is both bland and shallow.
It's a solid 7.5/10 with a great story and supporting characters that gets progressively weaker until it ends before overstaying its welcome.

As many have mentioned, the open world is what ultimately drags it down and feels tacked on to stretch the gameplay.
Got it for Christmas, played for about 3 hours before returning. Cool visuals and atmosphere if you're a Potterhead, but incredibly bland and boring gameplay.
As a regular gamer who played tons of open world games, I think it’s a 6/10. The theming is definitely novel and the art is great, the story is okay, but the open world mechanics are very run of the mill and bland, with a very weak progression system. It’s a very great first attempt for the studio though and I’m very happy that they did so well.

I lent my steamdeck to my cousin who’s not used to playing open world games but is a huge Harry Potter fan, and she’s just completely blown away and loves the game. At least a 9/10 for her. 

So it really depends on what kind of gamer you are, and if this is your first open world game and love Harry Potter, you’re gonna have a great time.
it fell off for me until i realized that canonically, the magic book that the ministry of magic gave me was actively telling me to cut off toad’s tongues and use crucio. 

that recontextualized the story enough for me to start finding the whole game’s story hilariously bad enough to start enjoying it again.
I loved playing the game but I’ll likely never pick it up again. I got the platinum trophy which doesn’t leave much content left uncovered.
I enjoyed it but I will mirror the sentiment that the open world got stale when you come across the 100th cave thats just a single room with a chest that gives you a piece of green quality clothing.

The visuals and atmosphere and everything about the castle itself were amazing. Nothing wrong with having an open world, but I feel like it didnt need to be as big. Remove the entire southern coastal section of the map. Have the game world just be the valley that Hogwarts is in;  the castle and its grounds, Hogsmeade, the forest etc. I'd rather have a smaller open world if it meant there was more stuff to do in the castle itself etc.
If you’re a Harry Potter fan it’s a joy exploring the castle and hogsmeade to lesser degree. The mechanics are a little underwhelming and only feel more so the longer you play.  When the game really opens up you realize the rest of the map is uninteresting and unrewarding. Then you’ve got a standard checklist type open world which just feels like a chore. I think they have good bones here so a sequel could be really good but they need it to become more focused and make progression feel more worthwhile.
It has been a top gaming experience for me and an absolute blast/pure fun, planning on replaying it in a month or two
The main quest gate is what made me put it down for a while. Going to Herbology class doesn’t really feel important when I’m tracking a world ending threat. It felt like I had to do actual homework. 

I’ll finish it eventually, but the way the laid out quests really fucked with the flow and pacing of the game.
I guess I'm OK with the generic Ubisoft open world gameplay loop because I spent 90 hours in it. I'm not a big Harry Potter fan. I watched and enjoyed the movies when they came out but never read the books. I had a pretty good time with the game. I thought some of the puzzle elements were a little too simple was my biggest complaint. Some of the combat arenas actually took me a couple tries to beat which was surprising to me.
It was fine. A bit shallower than I was expecting. Once I realized that being a dark wizard and a light wizard were pretty much exactly the same story, I stopped playing it.
This game should not have been open world

Maybe open around the castle and hogsheads, but the game outside of those two areas is kinda ass
Playing it right now and here are a few things I'm not a crazy fan of:

* the camera is awful. Sometimes it doesn't flip to the next enemy when locked on and it could great benefit from being just a little more zoomed out
* the character doesn't shut up sometimes. "All this loot here and Jackdaw didn't see it!".  It's like whiny Atreus.
* no wonder why they didn't include quidditch. Sure, it would be hard to make an equitable real time game without using mini games and they made flying feel like I'm driving a 1995 Buick LeSabre
Loved it. It got a little repetitive towards the end and the endgame basically devolved into “The chosen one must save the day” trope but I had a blast. The first game I stayed up till almost three in the morning playing on launch night in a long time. The castle was freakin amazing as well as the grounds around the school and Hogsmeade. It also has one of my favorite unexpected creepy missions that came from out of nowhere in gaming history. I’d say more but this horror element mission legit comes from out of nowhere and is creepy as hell. Very dark for something Harry Potter world related.
It was an average Ubisoft game carried by the Harry Potter IP.

Solid game but people made it seem like it was the most amazing thing when it came out.
I liked it a lot. I felt so much joy playing the game. The story wasn’t incredible or anything but flying around the world, the sound design, the magic. It just was awesome.
Pros: The castle feels fully realized, some interesting supporting characters amongst the students, broom flying feels amazing, incredible look and feel in capturing Hogwarts, the mission where you get your own Hogsmeade shop

Cons: Ludicrous main story that ends nonsensically, weak worldbuilding, lack of camaraderie amongst the main cast, fails to embody the school fantasy (classes are non-existent/an afterthought), magical creatures are poorly integrated, integration of unforgivable curses is poor
100% amazing experience I felt like a 12 year old again just walking around doing literally every single thing on the map. Amazing game, need a sequel ASAP.
I think the majority of the people already forgot about it, huge potential but it just turned out to be really repetitive after a while
I was so impressed and excited when I first got the game, they really nailed Hogwarts and the feel of the HP universe, but after 20 hours or so, you realize the world is fairly empty. The main character is so boring and kind of sounds like Harry, which really annoys me. Like, if you're not making it about Harry, then please, get a voice actor who sounds different... 

Also, the fact that there are not consequences for using Avada or any of the dark spells is so mind boggling. The whole theme of HP is good vs evil and the consequences and benefits for choosing either side. I did hear that they had a system in place, but it didn't make it in the game, but imo it's a massive flaw.

The game was a great starting point though, I really hope they build on it and focus on story, character and consequences for the next game. 

7/10 for me (haven't even finished it yet, got bored.)
I'm not the best person to ask, but I'll comment anyway.

When the game first came out, I could barely get more than 4 FPS on low settings at 540p even though my PC meets the minimum system requirements. So, I don't think very highly of something so unoptimized and I refuse to upgrade my PC last year just to play one game.

I do plan on upgrading my computer this year (I genuinely need to soon, if not now,) so I'll try to play it again when I'm done upgrading. Hopefully, I'll have more fun.
I thought they did an amazing job with the open world, the way they modeled out Hogwarts in its entirety was incredible. I thought they did a great job making the combat exciting. The overarching story was only ok, but all of the characters were super bland. There was nothing interesting about any of the teachers or other students. I never felt a connection to anyone. I sometimes even had trouble telling them apart. Things like the magical creature collecting was way more trouble than it was worth. You had to get through like 3 loading screens to get to where they are, and since you cant have them all in one place it was just annoying and inconvenient to visit them all. I mentioned how good the way they modeled out Hogwarts was, but it was almost completely wasted because you didn't have a lot to do there storywise except for the room of requirement and whatever class you needed to go to. 

Overall I liked it more than I disliked it, but felt like it was a lot of wasted potential.
Really enjoyed it. As others have said, it’s very very good at being Harry Potter high, but does suffer from bloat and less than inspiring quests. That being said there are definitely a few good side characters to interact with and plenty of exploration. 
Worst part about the game is if you finish the main quest the game doesn’t actually end unless you are a high enough level (not sure if that was changed after launch). That really ticked me off and I wasn’t really bothered to grind levels after spending about 25/30hrs on it. Overall though very enjoyable.
It's alright, I would kill for a Persona-esque game based in Hogwarts with emphasis on the school life and RPG progression.
The game is fun but I hope the sequel fleshes things out more, it’s very generic once you get past the fact you’re casting spells instead of swinging a sword.
Excellent representation of Hogwarts but as a game, I only found it ok. I currently dropped it as I felt already burnt out by it after 25 hours. I wish it had daily routines like in Persona where you had to go to class throughout the year and build friendships with some NPCs.

I’ll probably pick it back up after a few months. Ive been enjoying Cyberpunk right now
No idea why they didn’t go for the Persona route and have you attend classes and make friends. Would have been a much more “Harry Potter/Hogwarts” style unique experience than “here’s an open world 3rd person shooter but it’s magic”.
I got it second hand a little while back because I was curious.

The combat system was genuinely fun but the open world and optional tasks were extremely bland and un-interesting. The game's core story was really generic and boring, and it also did very little with the cast of characters for side quests. The Slytherin boy (forget his name) get's a full storyline but the other side characters are basically nothing.

If you're a big harry potter fan, they do a lot with hogwarts itself that will feel really cool and nostalgic, but after a bit you've done everything there is to do in hogwarts and there is A LOT of generic countryside questing to do.

The game is OKAY, but I think if it hadn't been tied into the harry potter brand it would not have sold much at all.
I wish it was way more persona than it was, I like the rp of going to hogwarts and doing school stuff way more than leaving the school every day to fight goblins in the woods and all the ancient wizard stuff.

If 90% of the drama was inter-house beef with the other kids and classes with it maybe peaking in the Christmas season with a showdown with some big bad I’d be way more stoked but the way all the stories panned out I was checked out by the mid way point
I really enjoyed exploring Hogwarts and Hogsmeade. I just wish i didnt have to Revelio every single step.
I hated the level cap, that max level didnt come until every damn little thing was finished.

The Merlin trials way overstayed their welcome.

I also disliked that after a certain point, no more xp was gained from defeating enemies.

It was a good game, with way too much Ubisoft-itis in the open world, and a flowed leveling system.
Its a good starting point to build off of,it was a fine 7.5/10 game.They just need to tighten up the focus on exploration outside of the castle/school grounds and have a better narrative
Not a huge Potter fan but I've read the books. Going into the game it was just a new game with new mechanics I thought would be worth a go. I like it although I haven't completed it yet. It has story and combat that go together but I'd like to see more enemies out in the wild, it seems shallow in that regard. 

The spells are fun to use and the mixing and matching can be interesting. The rooms you eventually get on the Room of Requirements are handy to grow the Cabbages and other violent plants and the materials from the animals are useful. The game isn't game of the year for me but it's a good game with enough content to get some decent play time. It runs well and looks good on my PC, I have no real complaints about it.
Somehow loved the world, but it felt like a lot of fetch quests and I hated moving location going back and forward.

I wish these kind of games wouldn't have this shitty quest system. Like, let me talk to the npc "telepathically" or something, don't make me go to its location to take the quest or whatever.

After I saw gameplay, I thought I'm going to hate it, but I actually liked it. I didn't finish the game and don't plan to it. I think I had like 10 hours in and I got bored of walking so much for almost nothing.
It was OK. The open world was fun to explore considering how pretty the locations are, but after a couple of hours there's not much reason to explore. Most of the rewards are either just cosmetics or gear, but their gear system was boring since it was just numbers. No unique buffs for wearing them, no "sets" that would unlock different bonuses when completed, nothing, just a higher number.

Combat was pretty satisfying though, even if a lot of the spells did the same thing. This is pretty much what motivated me to keep exploring the open world: I wanted to find more enemies to kill. It pretty much carried the game for me, something I did not expect at all.

Story and the characters were disappointing. Everything felt too "child friendly". Not that Harry Potter is usually grimdark, but the story felt like its primary audience was toddlers who had to be taught about the power of friendship. The books did start this way, but they, along with the audience, matured as they released and the game's story feels like a regression.
I wish this were the second game in the series and there were a first game more localized to the castle I think I would have liked them both more. They put so much work into the castle, but it felt like I was barely ever there. Wish there was more going on there.

edit: I still think the game was great for Harry Potter fans though. I enjoyed it a ton regardless.
Everything else has been said but no one's commented about the horrible broom controls. You use right analog stick up and down to move up and down in altitude. Left and right turned the camera. The game really needed to give us an option for normal flight controls.
It's starts pretty magical (hah!) and eventually devolves into a Ubisoft-style "do all the open world quests" game. There's some GREAT stuff, but being forced to grind in order to play the game isn't super fun. I genuinely wish it was 30% shorter. Maybe more.
Yeah, once they push you out of Hogwarts and out into the very generic open world is where it really started to feel weak. If they had shrunk the scope somewhat and made Hogwarts and the immediate vicinity feel more densely packed I think it would have been a huge improvement. I thought the first few sequences were really set up nicely. I also felt like giving your character a school schedule and doing something with the curfew system that they initially introduced would have been some really nice touches. Basically, narrow the scope but give it great depth. The game is sort of the definition of wide but shallow. Now, there are a few really great side quests out there, such as Minding Your Own Business, but there's just so much busy-work in each town, that you can easily probably miss some of these good side stories.
It starts off well because the setting but once you really start questing it get's repetitive. It needs more slice of life rather than action. Also the story isn't very interesting. I remember I think in the last dungeon and you have these wizards going, "there's no way we'd let goblins have the yadayada" and that just sounded pretty messed up going along with most of what was talked about goblins in the story. Regardless, very unmemorable game. Kind of disappointed a friend of mine convinced me to get it so they'd have someone to talk about it with. They didn't even beat the game
I grew up alongside the movies. As an adult I became a reader and started with the books. I cared about HP is basically what I’m saying.


When I started and for awhile it was a magical experience. I paid full price. I’d say that’s a success. I got something memorable out of it, they got their money. That being said, I stopped shortly after getting the broomstick. The castle and the famous towns is what I truly cared about. Open worlds like that are for the kids, who have more time to fill. If it was at the quality of The Witcher 3 I’d still be playing it today, like I still am with that. Never flew somewhere that felt like anything besides intern-made padding, not that I explored much.
I've only played a few hours of it at this point. I found the dialogue to be nothing like real people and instead video game characters speaking at you in tutorialese. I found some of the quests baffling e.g. when you learn accio they do a game where you have to bring a ball to you - surely there are plenty of more exciting wizarding ideas that can be made. I found it weird that orges that look like they had come straight out of shadow of Mordor invade Hogsmeade... I feel like more thought overall could have been put into making it seem like a coherent world, but also understand that making a game, especially a harry potter one is extremely difficult. Hopefully it picks up a bit once I'm out of the beginner sections!
Just started it a few weeks ago. About 50 hours in. It's pretty good. Hogwarts is a little annoying to traverse and flind collectibles though.
I feel like it was a good start, but a good couple DLCs to add even more immersion would have done good to the game.

Kind of a shame they immediately wrote off DLCs.
Like others have said, first part, I was all in, following quests, listening to convos, collecting all the things. Mid game I just stopped doing quests, basically just explored the map. Once I had seen the whole map the drive to play, finish quests, finish the game just fell off. That first part tho was pure heaven.
Loved it at the time. Beat it and did a lot, but not all, of the side content. 

I still jump in every now and then to run around the world but that’s about it. Waiting for the alleged sequel.
It’s a competent open world game set in the HP setting, but I think it’s a bad Hogwarts game. I enjoyed 100%ing it mostly, but my immersion was quite gone once I realized that I was basically a student that kills hundreds and basically never goes to class…

Such a waste of the setting imo. For how big the franchise is, the books are surprisingly light on actual fighting action.They could have done so much with a non combat oriented open world game just doing wizard stuff and experiencing stories in and around Hogwarts. 

Also the game was a performance and control nightmare on pc. Why are my spell bars max 4, I have a bloody keyboard!
It was better as a theme park than as a game or a story.

I did not enjoyed typical open world action game skeleton with crafting / gathering / stat numbers that barely matter / exploration / GoW tier "puzzles" / etc. Like, Hogwarts is almost *made* for metroidvania. I don't want to crucio goblins and then adava kedarva them for pentakills. I want to explore the huge castle full of secrets by progressively unlocking more and more spells to do so.
I liked the game. It isn't something awesome special, but it's well made and for me it was short enough to finish it before I lost the interest.  

My biggest critic on the game is "forced" "open world". It's cool that you can visit the forest and Hogsmeade, but I was really disappointed that you couldn't take the train to visit some other places.
I personally would rather prefer if they would make more content for the school year, more stuff/quests inside Hogwarts.
Also I understand that they are working on a Multiplayer game and it would be probably a waste of resources to program the whole quidditch game, but it was also missing.
Hogwarts is the star of the show. The school looked absolutely incredible. The fun was walking around and discovering new things. I wish the rest of the game was crafted as well.
Bought it on release and earned the platinum. I have a hard time remembering what the story was even about. Mostly forgettable but I did enjoy being in the world of Harry Potter and exploring Hogwarts and Hogsmeade. I personally think the devs should’ve focused more on creating puzzles and dungeons within Hogwarts than spreading everything thin with the overworld.
Loved the game. It portrays Hogwarts beautifully and the combat system was the most fun I've had with combat in long time.

It however is not an open world game I'll come back to for lengthy game sessions, after completing the quests the game offers very little.

I did not feel the need to clear out any and all of the repeated tasks. But would buy a content DLC in a heart beat (same for a sequel).
Yeah this about sums it up for me. Fantastic job with the art design / world though.
    Likewise with me. I haven't really dived into the Ubisoft formula much so it was pretty fresh but I did feel that stale aimless repetitive feeling towards the later half.

If they do a #2 sequel and really flesh things out, they could have quite the engaging full game.
I totally agree with you about the first half of the game versus the second half.

The southern part of the game map felt very uninteresting, and I wanted to spend as little time there as possible. That whole area of the map felt obligatory for completing the field guide, but I was otherwise not excited about being there.

Regarding the difficulty, I noticed that once you hit max XP and you're able to cap out on your defense and offense (450 I think?), you become really powerful even at the higher difficulty settings, especially with certain builds like the Chomping Cabbage build. Those cabbages can tear through even the toughest ogres without a sweat. But I don't mind, and in fact I prefer games that reward me with ridiculous power at the very end. But reaching that maximum basically requires 100%'ing the game, and at that point there really isn't anything else to do. There's not much replayability within a single character slot.
    That same person feels  very excited about being there.. spending the Hogwarts..money for very expensive rooms on the holidays!!...... seems like everyone has their thoughts crossed!!..🤷🏾‍♀️ ask ya self why
Nailed it. There's a strong foundation to build on there though....I think if they could flesh out the school part by making it a bit Persona like, then they'd have a real winner
    i think most games should stay away from "making it a bit persona like". it's hard to pull off, and if you don't pull it off, you end up with countless hours of boring dialogue. e.g. midnight suns

> Harry Potter game that's truly open world and where you can go anywhere and find almost anything you can think of from the books or movies

Dude!! Play the games based on the movies, most of them feature an open world Hogwarts to explore. Not to the degree of this game, but they still do. Chamber of Secrets and Prisoner of Azkaban were my favourites.

The first three games are based more on the books than the movies too. They feature characters and scenes that didn't make it into the movies plus the art style is way more book like on top of it.
    PoA was the one I had that I just kept playing over and over non stop from start to finish and getting everything to 100%.
Flying Buckbeak felt just as amazing as in the movie, and when you encounter the Dementors during the mission for fairy wings during the snow storm? I still remember all that. Good times.
    Oddly the game boy colour games both had completely open Hogwarts to wanser around in despite being the most technically limited console.
    Haha those are actually the only 2 Harry Potter games I had as a kid. Chamber of Secrets on GBA and Prisoner of Azkaban on PC. I don't remember Chamber of secrets being open world, but that's probably because it was the gameboy version. Prisoner of Azkaban was pretty awesome though.
This was 100% my experience. Exploring Hogwarts, Hogsmeade, seeing the Wizardi g world come to life in all its amazing detail.. assisting classes, going on andventures… it seemed like a dream made reality.

But when the honeymoon phase falls off all you are left with is a repetitive combat system , repetitive button mashing fights, uninspired world design outside of Hogsmeade and the Castle, repetitive sidequests that reward you with loot that is ultimately not worth upgrading or crafting because of how easy it is to just get a better drop. It was honestly a real chore to finish this game. Still, it wasn’t a BAD game. Solid 7/10 experience, probably an 8 if you are a massive Potterhead.

I still feel this was a great first title… and can hope they massively improve the sidequesting and core gameplay loop for the inevitable sequel.
Agree with this. Tbh, Hogwarts is the first game I’ve played that felt truly next gen to me. Having that huge castle with so many things happening at once, and being able to near-seamlessly transition to an open world? Along with some of the best animations I’ve seen in a game. I just wish the map was smaller/more interesting and there was more enemy variety.
> Then in the second half things started to feel pretty repetitive.

Sums up the book series accurately as well.
>Tenth cave in a row that’s a straight path to a chest with redundant gear.

random loot was the worst part for me. it made it pointless to explore or do side stuff. random loot has it's place, but when I solve a puzzle, or find a secret, I expect to get something 'good'.
    Oh I spent an hour getting to a box with nothing in it except garb even Dobby wouldn't wear
        [deleted]
            Yeah the itemization was really dull, it was neat that it changed your appearance but the stats themself felt so uninteresting and boring. I would sometimes be wearing something I had found 10 new armor sets ago because nothing new was a big enough difference to consider using instead.
        Tbh this kinda reminds me of Morrowind loot where you'd kill some mini boss and he just drops an empty bottle and a chitin dagger (shittiest weapon in the game)
            [removed]
                Yeah, Skyrim is the actual offender here with constant random leveled loot making the already gamey "master chest at the end of every dungeon" more underwhelming.
    Hogwarts school uniforms on everyone meanwhile we got the idiot MC running around in a tutu, bowl of fruit in their head wearing stripper boots shooting aveda kedvra down the hall from the principals office.
        That was pretty much the only good thing about the loot tbh. The stuff you could get was so hideous it was clearly deliberate. I only played because my wife is a big Harry Potter fan and it drove her nuts to watch me in serious cutscenes wearing a Hannibal Lector mask and jester outfit.
            [removed]
                Or maybe people had more fun being silly. Crazy that you went straight to discrediting them
                    This game has a lot of weird fans who don't want to hear anything that sounds like criticism.
                        It's the people that don't play a lot of videogames. Not to be an elitist but most of the people that praised this game were people whose first open world game was Hogwarts Legacy, they had no frame of reference
                Why the fuck would I want to do that? The random ass gear is the best part of the game.
        There was an update very early on that let you wear any item and turn the appearance to something else. So you could wear anything and look like a normal hogwarts student.
            super annoying to change the transmog for every new item though.
                There's a mod that auto swaps for you depending on location
                    ah shit, where were you 2 weeks ago? :)
                        yeah that and skipping the lockpick game are must haves
            That wasn't an update IIRC, just a feature no one paid attention to at the start.
        This is my favorite part of the game so far, tbh
    Even most games are semi-random. So like if you beat a boss they make sure you're drawing from a limited list of better drops so you don't get like, a bunch of common boots or something.
    I have a weird feeling and can't decide if random loot is better than set loot.

For example for me Elden ring had no replayability because it wasn't fun to do yet again a dungeon that I've done, to get the loot I already got with my first character.
I mean, it makes it easier for you to go for another kind of build but that's it.

Even in elden ring, after a while, I was bored of doing the dungeons, and I searched on the internet whhat are the drops and got the ones I cared about. So I guess in a way it makes it better because otherwise I couldn't be bothered to do every dungeon till I got the drop I wanted.

But for this game, I didn't really cared about the gear that much in a sense of "need to make a certain build". It was whatever I get if it has higher stats I'm equipping it. So I didn't mind the randomness.
        Elden Ring will probably be one of their best games to play with a randomizer, but i'm typically fine in general with replaying the games after a bit of time.

I'm looking forward to starting my 2nd playthrough once the DLC gets an actual release date.
            > Elden Ring will probably be one of their best games to play with a randomizer

My friend and I are currently on probably our 4th [randomizer](https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/428) + [seamless co-op](https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/510) run of Elden Ring. It's a blast. Most runs eventually have some funny or outrageous scenarios with enemy/boss placement.

For those reading this that are unfamiliar with Souls games randomizers: You can adjust the degree of "randomization" in several ways with the tool. Item and enemy placement are independently controlled, there's a pool of "important locations" that important items can be restricted to (and you can control which locations are considered important), or they can be sent to any random spot. There's sliders for "how random" enemies and items are. And several other tweaks and options.

Also, you can also somewhat get around the loot randomization if you decide you really want a particular item but don't know where it is. There is an option that allows you to purchase item location hints from Kale at the Church of Elle (the vendor in the church closest to the beginning of the game). Also, the randomizer has a `spoiler_logs` folder that can either provide general hints for where an item is, or it will give an exact location, without having to spend runes on hints in-game. So, if it wasn't placed too deep into late game areas while you're still in early game, you can probably go get an item to fit your build if you want.

It's a fun way to replay the game, especially with a friend using the seamless co-op mod.
        I feel like set loot adds more to the replayability. With set loot I'll know "alright so I need this armor and this sword, they are here and here so I need to figure out the best way to get there" and make a different build quickly to make the experience different. With random loot it's just annoying having to micromanage my inventory every ~10 minutes just to make sure I'm not using something worse.
        There's a difference between a randomized loot table and completely random stats. 
Randomized loot is almost always bad in my opinion. It just becomes a game of repetitive garbage collection and basically a gacha game.

I'd argue that Elden Ring probably isn't the best comparison because of the huge build variety. Loot might as well be random if you're not really planning to look anything up. Most of what you pick up isn't going to fit your build. But you'd never want the stat scaling on those items to be completely randomized where you might never get the roll you need on a certain weapon. That's just disappointing and makes you suffer through painful areas that exist only to completely waste your time.

Games need to find better ways to add replay value than having people fishing for randomized loot to pad their game time.
            For me it really depends on the game or the type of game I guess. 

I don't mind some RNG when it comes to items. For example, I loved playing a game like Destiny 2 or a MMORPG where doing a raid, wouldn't mean you'd get the item you want. (Not talking about shitty currency to craft gear, but actual gear piece).

It makes it exciting for me to play the raid over and over again to get that good, unique piece of loot and if the game is fun, the better.

I wouldn't like if that piece of gear would be a guarantee drop or if it has random stats and I need to get the same piece of gear for 1000x times till I get the stats I want.

I'm in a really weird position when it comes to these things.
        That's how I felt for replays of Elden Ring, it makes it a lot weaker for replays strictly. However that first experience with the game is so magical, finding unique loot everywhere and rewarding (even though you won't use most weaps or spells as they don't match your build). The weapons having their own moveset adds to the value on its own imo
I would take the unique set loot everywhere like Elden Ring did for an amazing first experience (100+ for me) rather than better replayability for the alternative
> That’s it , hope their next game they take a harder look at some of the mechanics for the open world.

95 Merlin Trials in the game. The first ten were novel and unique, then you slowly realize that all the following trials are just rehashes of the first few. Tying inventory space, which is an important game mechanic, to completing Merlin Trials is just one of the long list of annoyances that drove me to uninstall the game.
    Also locking the Alohomora spell behind a stupid long quest line killed all my interest in exploring the open world in the beginning when every second door or chest is locked...
        Unlock Alohomora to get demiguises which is used to level up Alohomora which is used to get more demiguises which is used to level up Alohomora one more time which is used to find useless shit.
    you "only" need like 50 to max out the slots I think. I looked at the map and saw only a few remaining, thought I'd go for the achievement. Little did I know that you need to "discover" them first, which I found out way too late, I was missing like ~35.
    Finding out about the Merlin trials was my glass shattering moment. Literally like the Toy Story 2 “I don’t wanna play with you anymore” scene, I just lost all desire to pick the game back up.
    Yeah felt the same about the Arkham Knight riddler trophies and why I've stopped playing it. Developers should really stop with these repetitive things in games, especially when it's tied to something important.
    If only another particular game released this year had even that amount of variety.
> Once the Harry Potter high falls off … it fell off for me.

I think about this sometimes with licensed games I like. I adore the Ghostbusters game Terminal Reality made but during my last replay I wondered if someone wasn't a huge Ghostbusters dork like I am, would they be able to get *anything* out of it? It's a good game, but is it good enough to really grab hold of someone who doesn't care that the original cast is in that game, or that the painting of Vigo is in the firehouse?

When the whole shitshow about this game started brewing someone who didn't play games asked me if I was going to get it and I said no, purely because I'm not into Harry Potter at all. No idea if I'd be able to get past that so I just didn't bother.
    Not a lot of licensed games that stand out even without the license. GoldenEye, obviously. The Arkham games and the new Spider-Man games (although it's hard to imagine someone not liking those characters and liking the gameplay). Maybe the two towers and rotk games? Maybe some of the Star wars games?
        These are good choices. Similarily I think the Mordor games would have worked on their own merit with the Nemesis system etc. It was kind of shoehorned into LotR lore anyway
            I'm not a LotR fan (liked the books, movies were fine), and I thought the first game was fun. The second game ended up being more of a slog, and I hated everything about Shelob turning into a sexy woman.
                The second one irritates me to no end because I'm quite certain that the only reason it was a slog is because WB was flagrant trying to push those orc lootboxes so the grind was padded out to absurd degrees.

Once the game fell off the radar a little bit they went back, removed the store, and reduced the grind by a whopping 30%.

How much praise would that game be getting if they had just made it fun to begin with instead of deliberately hamstringing it to push MTX?

I'd love for someone who was bored of the game to go back and re-evaluate it without all the empty calories but "hey will you go play this game you already think is incredibly boring for me?" isn't exactly a compelling sales pitch.
                    I played post-lootbox and it was still grindy....but I also checked out of the story pretty quickly and just wanted to get my 100%. Whatever balance the first game had found didn't carry long into the second.
        There are tons of good licensed games in various niches even if you ignore specific franchise appeal, what people think if is always in the AAA sphere. Dragonball, Alien, TMNT, Scott Pilgrim, various Star Trek games, Riddick
        I think Republic Commando would fit, you don't have to be a fan of Star Wars to like that game. Solid shooter, squad based gameplay, good level design, etc. 

"Get some bacta Delta!"
            Republic Commando and KOTOR are the ones that could stand without the licence. Mass Effect essentially is just more modern KOTOR without the licence.

I'm a relatively good judge; I don't like Star Wars that much.
                KOTOR kinda ruined star wars for me; no other star wars media (outside of the books and comics) hits the heights of KOTOR 1 and 2 to me. They feel like they actually flesh out the star wars universe, and makes all the shows and movies a little bittersweet from not using some of the themes and in universe things that KOTOR established.
                    I agree totally. The films feel flat compared to how richly the setting can be opened up in an RPG. Beyond the corporate meddling and the simply formulaic storytelling (present across the series tbh), the films simply don't have enough time to get into it - and are restricted by making it kid-friendly.

There's such an opportunity for a modern KoTOR, especially after the success of BG3. I just don't want EA to have anything to do with it beyond handing it off to a talented studio.
                I'm surprised to hear that Kotor lands. That feels like you have to like Star Wars to like it, to me
                    KOTOR benefits from being, well, set in the Old Republic. The barrier to entry is just “liking sci-fi” and then the only concepts you really need to know about from Star Wars are lightsabers and Force powers, everything else is pretty self contained.
                        I think it could be a barrier if you've literally seen 0 star wars. But even just a movie or two and you've gotten enough of an intro for KOTOR.

And I mean... It's gotta be a majority of western audiences that have seen a (single) star wars movie... right?
                    Nah, honestly Star Wars benefits from being a fairly generic setting.

So it was actually rare that you needed to be a fan of the series, to like any of the games. Since most were their own thing separate from the movies.

Most of the games could've been a new IP. These games like KOTOR or Rougue Squadron just happen to have Star Wars themes/skins.
        Arkham and Spider-Man games are totally reliant on the franchise though. It's fun BECAUSE you play those superheroes. And they're frankly very similar to Hogwarts Legacy in being a "generic open world" by the way (they have better stories though)
            I would disagree. I think removing the franchise the games would still be fun. If Spidey had a zip line instead of web, it would still be fun to zoot around the city and I don't think I've seen any Batman media where he just hangs around on gargoyles.
                I mean if you remove the franchise you remove the whole gadgets, combat system as it is, the traversal system for both games, the story, the enemies type, the environments... (all of this come from the franchise) and you're left with the template of an open world game, exactly like with Hogwarts Legacy. 

I don't see how that's different. Games are carried by their setting all the time (it can be a franchise but also just something like Ghost of Tsushima carried by the medieval Japan setting executed very well or Horizon by the robot dinosaurs to fight)
                    I mean you are removing gameplay in those examples. There is no reason why you can't keep the elements that are from the franchise.

There was a game, whose name escapes me now, developed a few years ago that was made by someone who worked on the Spider-Man 2 movie tie in game. It was basically about web slinging but with no Spider-man, they just used a grapple gadget to create the same effect. The Arkham game could easily be reskinned as a Ninja game. Tonnes of games give the players gadgets to use, so it is not uniquely Batman.
        The Scott pilgrim videogame is a really solid side-scrolling beat 'em up, which was made for the movie.
            I am just playing it wrong or is that game really difficult? I've put a bunch of time into it and I still can't get passed the second level?
                If you have a second controller you can do some cheats to give yourself a bunch of money and get a bunch of upgrades in the first level.

But yeah the game is kinda difficult at first, unless you get a bunch of upgrades.
                    Ah, okay. Thanks. I was really surprised I was making little to no progress and I felt I couldn't use other characters because they weren't leveled. Good to know I'm not mad and grinding is part of the game.
    The only IP game that holds up regardless of fandom is Shrek Superslam, because it's mechanically just so fucking awesome and a ton of fun.
Same here. First 20-ish hours were brilliant from riding that high, but once it falls off and the rest of the game really sets in, it gets old quick. 

I don’t think it was bad, but it was definitely way too big and too much bloat. Just Hogwarts and Hogsmeade would have been a sufficient enough map, but the game being as huge as it is was definitely a detriment to me

EDIT: also a lot of the gameplay systems were basically pointless. Gear? Pointless. Even the neat breeding minigame in the Room of Requirement was completely pointless, and the novelty wore off after a bit. It was definitely a game that I have to assume suffered from massive scope creep and would have really benefitted from being smaller and more focused. And the story being another “THE CHOSEN ONE” was a bit of an eye roll 

I would have loved a metroidvania style set solely in Hogwarts and the grounds. You could unlock new sections of the castle when you learn new spells, things like that. Combat encounters might have been a little difficult to justify, but maybe you could just say that the students like to duel. Or maybe there’s certain sections of the castle that are prone to monsters. In any case, I think that would have been a much better game.
    Yeah they definitely should have scaled it back a lot. Keep Hogwarts, Hogsmeade, the Forbidden Forest, and a little bit of the area around Hogwarts and Hogsmeade (Upper and Lower Hogsfield).
        Or even keep everything up until that lower portion of the map with the coastline that doesn't open up until like past halfway through the game. The rest of the world was pretty awesome to explore or just fly around in, and that initial area of the map localized within the first half of the game felt like a great size. The moment the bottom part of the map was when the burnout started to creep in for me. That was a little overwhelming and pretty unnecessary even for the story.
            Agreed. What was even down there? Plus with a map that big I had zero desire to fly there. I’d literally fast travel to the nearest marker and then fly.
        That was my assumption. No reason they couldn't just add places as they go with more content, themes/biomes or whatever, etc.
        I loved the size. It was nice seeing the grounds around and flying, as that’s the world that Hogwarts exists in and it’s amazing to explore. It feels odd in this day to be artificially kept to the castle. 

That said they just needed better mechanics, story, and things to fill said world with.
    What you’re describing (the game you wanted) sounds more like the Lego Harry Potter games actually.
    Reminds me the early days of the PS3 generation, the open world games had to be bigger and bigger, this sequel has 3x the size if compared to the original, blablabla even to this day some games repeats that concept, which is dumb, if I'm not mistaken it was leaked that GTA 6 map will be 2x bigger than Red Dead 2. Size just for the sake of it, bloat without meaningful content
        >if I'm not mistaken it was leaked that GTA 6 map will be 2x bigger than Red Dead 2. 

I'm fine with that, it's fun to explore the map with a car, go several minutes at top speed on highways, etc. Just hope they make a balanced map instead of a map like 5's that has one big city and fuck all in the rest of it.
            It depends if the traversal is fun or not. I honestly had a big smile on my face when they announced Spider-Man 2 would be way bigger, the game will feature a extra island, etc.. because I love to move around in that game, never used quick travel. As for GTA, I am not a big fan of the moon physiques, so the leak kinda disappointed me a little bit. Red Dead 2 works because the horse riding feels relaxing, also the realistic physiques can lead to some goofy situations. GTA is all over the place, you touch a little obstacle and the car catapults in the air... I know a lot of people love this, but I am not a big fan tbh
        The thing with GTA is that the gameplay usually helps or goes nicely with the increased size of the map. Especially as those games go for the more outlandish approach to open-world gameplay design. Whereas RDR2 went down the ultra-realism route of "look how painful & difficult it was to live in those times!" which whilst interesting to play...becomes a slog when you only have short periods of time to play.
            That’s fair but I will die on the hill that rdr2 is a top game of all time.
            > which whilst interesting to play...becomes a slog when you only have short periods of time to play.

Never felt that way to me. I could've played forever.
            > which whilst interesting to play...becomes a slog when you only have short periods of time to play.

Honestly RDR2 might be the slowest game, that doesn't feel like a slog at all. I could have played that game for another 200 hours if there was something to do. Very very relaxing game.

But tbh, Rockstar's approach of any of these "realism" things is always fake as fuck. You never needed to worry about eating, warm, or anything like that. They're honestly like genuine role playing mechanics, easy to ignore, but if you wish to play grizzled country cowboy, you can.
            I am in the minority, I prefer the "realistic" gameplay of Red Dead if compared to the moon physiques of GTA. In the end, it all depends if the traversal is fun, if the map is filled with interesting stuff, etc.. for example, I did not liked how Rocksteady announced Arkham Knight will have 3x the size of Arkham City, they will include the batmobile as the novelty, etc.. in the end, Arkham Knight has a boring map and the excess of batmobile can be annoying, the bloated size did not helped that game imo (and Arkham Origins suffers even more on this regard). 

And I am excited to play Horizon 2 on PC... but I hope this game will be just slightly bigger than the original, the traversal in Horizon can feel like a slog sometimes, the devs have to exercise some parsimony, sometimes less is more... Tears of the Kingdom is another example, the "depths" are just so fucking boring! First time you enter the "depths", it's amazing, scary, etc.. but when you go there for the 10th time... or even worse, if you are actually trying to unlock every "light tree" to reveal the whole map, it's a goddamn slog, way worse than Red Dead 2 or any other open world game I've played tbh
    I agree. It’s still fun and charming but after 25 hours i shelved it.
    Agreed, I'm getting bored of these quantity over quality open world games. Give me a few dense, well-crafted areas over a big ass map that I'll just end up flying over.
> Tenth cave in a row that’s a straight path to a chest with redundant gear.

Honestly, I'm just tired of games filling themselves up with rng loot and vendor-trash. One of the things I really appreciated about Jedi Survivor was that all the chests were either cosmetics, or tokens to unlock cosmetics. So you didn't feel compelled to get them if you were buzzing through the story, but also you knew that whatever you were getting was unique and new. 

Some games, it's fine for, but anything following a Ubisoft Formula Open World doesn't at all.
    Jedi Survivor really impressed me with that - I was really disappointed with that aspect of JFO (though I loved it overall) so it was nice to see Respawn take the criticism to heart and greatly improve the variety of cosmetics and stuff. 

I think a Hogwarts 2 should make regular chests cosmetic gear only and then have set loot "artifact" pieces of gear in bespoke, handcrafted dungeons. Make those pieces have specific quests or legends associated with them, like maybe you hear about an ancient wizard that lost his magical locket in a cave. Then you KNOW when you seek it out or happen across it during exploration that it's going to give you a really unique buff or ability and not just "+10% chomping cabbage damage" or whatever.
Absolutely agreed.

The game should have been HUGELY trimmed down. Ditch 95% of the world and just keep hogwarts, hogsmeade, forbidden forest and maybe the train station and like 1 village and focus all your efforts in to those elements. Ditch all the padding regarding the open world and just focus on the exploration and magic of hogwarts and the harry potter IP itself. Shorten the game like 33-50% and multiply the social aspect of going to school and interacting with your classmates by 5 times (hello persona has been around for decades you can take inspiration or just copy).

Still, it definitely isnt a terrible game. Just in the 6-8 range depending on what you prefer in your open world ventures.
    > multiply the social aspect of going to school and interacting with your classmates by 5 times (hello persona has been around for decades you can take inspiration or just copy).

Bully too, while Bully wasn't in depth in terms of classmate interaction.

You literally had to go to school in that game, you had to be at your first class by a certain time or you were truant. You could fail classes.

I was a little disappointed seeing such a fleshed out Hogwarts interior, only for it, to not really be used.
This was my feeling as well, and that high fell off pretty quickly after I stopped exploring Hogwarts and started venturing into the broader open world.

The open world, many of the side quests, and the combat are just very generic.

I could absolutely see how if a reviewer basically explored Hogwarts and then speed rushed through the main quest and ignored most of the content outside of the castle, they might come away with a positive impression after 12-15 hours of gameplay.
    Lore wise it felt kind of hamfisted too. The books and movies seem like Hogwarts is well hidden and isolated from pretty much everywhere but Hogsmeade, yet in this game its surrounded for miles by bustling wizarding villages and hamlets. 

Maybe the time difference in setting would explain it but it still doesn't seem right
        I don’t think it really contradicts much, the villages shown in the game are all quite small. It seems reasonable to me that there would be other wizards living out away from muggle civilization.
        On the whole country, the area we explore is still very small, it's the outskirts of Hogwarts which are without Muggles so it makes sense wizards are installed there (though why they aren't all at Hogsmeade is kind of weird, it's not like it's so huge you can't find room anymore...)
    Agree except the combat, I don't feel like it was very generic. Sure it had the Arkham button counter system but you could mix and match your spells to good effect, making some creative combos, and the enemies even had weak points like pulling the frog's tongue out with a specific spell etc. It was probably one of the best parts of the game. 

The only thing is the loot system and enemy variety betrayed it, in a sequel with actual meaningful gear traits you could have much more build flexibility and way cooler spell augments that would give even more variety on top of more enemies to fight.
>hope their next game they take a harder look at some of the mechanics for the open world

WB wants to make all their games live service, or at least their highest performing franchises. Hogwarts Legacy could potentially be a victim, next game might be microtransaction hell if it happens
This is the exact take I had. They really did do an amazing job nailing the Harry Potter aesthetic, especially the castle itself. But the game itself is really just very basic open world fetch quest shit. The combat has potential, but as it is, it’s just a color matching simulator, and the actual unique use of most of the spells doesn’t really matter, as long as you pop them shields. The areas outside the castle and hogsmeade were pretty bland overall. The story was semi enjoyable and a few of the other parts of the game, like the room of requirement were actually fairly charming, but the moment I beat the main story, I turned it off and never thought about it again. It just had no holding power at all
Honestly if the map was limited to Hogwarts and Hogsmeade I think it would be a better game for me personally. Not everything has to be this huge open world, especially when it’s filled with a bunch of nothing.
    Yeah the thing is that the game outstayed its welcome and I have a dozen memories of amazing moments in hogwarts and hogsmeade and remember like nothing about the rest of the game. Because of everything else, the combat which started amazing gets stale.

I feel like it was padded as an afterthought to give you more to do with the broom and flying beasts, but it’s unnecessary. If they lost most of that stuff, and instead added quidditch and let you floo powder to diagon alley, it would be an almost perfect game.
I don't think you really need to be a Harry Potter fan to enjoy stuff like exploring Hogwarts/Hogsmeade and flying around on a broom.

That's all still part of the gameplay and doesn't really have anything to do with the Ubisoft formula.
    The only Harry Potter stuff I've interacted with was watching Deathly Hallows 2 with some friends in a theater, but I still thoroughly enjoyed Hogwarts Legacy.
What do people even mean by generic Ubisoft game these days? Because I agree the game feels very generic but it's nothing like a Ubisoft game. I think this term has just become the new lazy criticism of any mediocre open world game.
    Ubisoft kinda made that template for gameplay though. 

This game is a toolbox of rpg mechanics. 
-talent tree
-crafting 
-collecting
-gear with rarity and upgrades
-challenges
-exploring rewards
-fetch quests
-leveling
-cosmetics
-good and evil story choices

Ubisoft gets called out a lot because they’ve been using this toolbox approach for a long time. The criticism is that they should focus more on quality and not quantity, instead of doing a presenting a toll box of rpg mechanics under a licensed IP. They didn’t create something new and innovative. 

 I still love it though! It scratches all the mental ticks for rpg players.

            I don't know how the last three or so years have led from the Ubisoft Formula meaning "climbing towers, clearing outposts, unlocking chunks of the map, collect 100 doodads, etc." and has become "anything that is an open world action RPG."
        Ubisoft just has two series that follow it which is the same as other publishers regularly doing those games. 

I mean people are clamoring for Horizon, Spider-Man or Ghost of Tsushima for example (all from the same publisher). They're following that exact same formula. The Witcher 3 or Cyberpunk are praised as masterpieces, they're doing that too. Skyrim did it too. Even GTA is kind of that (no gear but the Ubisoft open world thing is from even before AC got gear). 

There are more games following that formula not done by Ubisoft than by them. It's basically the open world template/genre, I'm not sure what people want. Even stuff like Elden Ring or Breath of the Wild just have a variation of it.
        You just described le 9/10 Reddit favorite Spider-Man 2
            I mean yes but Spider-Man 2 isn't bloated to hell. Its like 20-30 hours to do litteraly everything, MAX.
    This. Ubisoft formula is a thing because it works. It is up to the individual game whether or not they pull it off well and make each reptitive experience still feel engaging and unique.
        How do people still not get this?

Ubisoft has been selling games and making bank for 15 years using this formula. And dozens of other studios used it well and made bank too.

Its like complaining about too many sitcoms in TV. Like, what?
            Remember folks, it's only a "Ubisoft-style game" if you don't like it!

That's why *Ghost of Tsushima* and *Horizon: Forbidden West* get a pass.
                
Both of those games are frequently called Ubisoft games.

GoT ruined AC for me, because it's just AC without most of the Ubisoft game design garbage that infests their open world games.
                    Not going to lie but I got sick of GoTs foxes fairly quick.
                Not to mention that the first Ubisoft-style game was Witcher 3 lol
                    It was AC1...
            It's the Reddit echo chamber vs the rest of the world, criticizing the Ubisoft formula is fair but one has to realize that 90% of people don't give a shit
                Meh. Both Elden Ring and Breath of the Wild to a certain extent steered away from the traditional Ubisoft open world formula and people love those games all the more for it.
                    That has nothing to do with what I said. Ubisoft formula games consistently sell well because most gamers don't dislike the formula, even though you'd think most people do based on Reddit.
                        They don't sell as well as Elden Ring, BOTW, RDR2, GTA though.

It has a lot to do with what you said. The Ubisoft design formula isn't the biggest problem, but the phoned in lazy approach to these games does not generate the sales that the high quality open world games do.

They still sell well, but even Ubi doesn't report the actual sales data of mainline AC anymore. They now do revenue.
                            >They don't sell as well as Elden Ring, BOTW, RDR2, GTA though.

You're just moving the goalposts here. The formula is successful, that's my point, and saying it's not as successful as some of the best selling open world games doesn't change that.
                >criticizing the Ubisoft formula is fair but one has to realize that 90% of people don't give a shit

So? Why is there a contingency of people on this website who think "This thing made a lot of money so you can't criticize it! You're just a stinky Redditor!" is some major own?
                    >This thing made a lot of money so you can't criticize it!

I literally said, and I quote, "criticizing the Ubisoft formula is fair", in my comment.

If you can't read maybe don't go on forums?
                        And yet you immediately follow that sentence uo with, to paraphrase 'lol who gives a shit'.
                            That's not a paraphrase, that's a strawman.

I said 90% of people don't care, because we were talking about how much criticism the formula gets on Reddit yet how successful it seems to be.

Once again, if you can't read then don't go on forums.
                                You're expanding on what you said, not quoting yourself. It'd be useful for you to actually know what a paraphrase in this scenario is, huh?

Oh the irony of chastising someone for not reading while flat out having to concede you did not articulate yourself well enough the first go-around.
            Also its not like Ubisoft did suddenly bring this concept up and now everyone uses it. 


This formula has been going for decades and just gets more and more expended. 


Even in games like Gothic 1 and 2 you can find plenty of game play elements that are associated with today's "generic Ubisoft Title".


Basically all open world games have always lived and worked with the same patterns for like 25 years now.
            A lot of reddit commenters are insecure children who don't feel like they should like what's popular. Everything has to be counter to the culture in order to feel special and unique.
            The "Ubisoft formula" is basically the open world game design lol. Literally every open world game follow that formula with more or less variation on it (yes even Elden Ring or Breath of the Wild do)
                Nah that's GTA3 or even Mario 64 design.

Many open world games don't have any Ubisoft design philosophy in them.

Ubisoft design is specifically the defeat the copy/paste base > climb the tower gameplay loop they made in AC and Far Cry. That's what people mean.

BOTW and Elden Ring of course both do this. But plenty do not.
    I actually just beat the game recently and I thought to myself, would I recommend this to someone who is not a Harry Potter fan? And I said no. The game itself is pretty mediocre but serviceable enough if you like the wizarding world.

But to answer your question about generic ubisoft game, to me this is basically open world filled with cookie cutter map marker objectives. So they made a huge map, but filled it with boring content like merlin trials, raid/poacher camps, broom balloons, butterfly chests, ancient magic thing, and whatever else was on there. I like the content in the game to be unique enough so that I never feel like its repetitive. Most games just go overboard and do this like any assassins creed and far cry. Even popular games like witcher 3 and spiderman. The one game I think did it pretty great was ghost of tsushima, it didn't feel like it over stayed its welcome and that is a bit ironic since its basically the assassins creed game ubisoft wished it could make.
    This game is so much fucking better than an ubisoft game. Those games are immediately boring and repetitive, 100% filler. Hogwarts was outstanding and breathtaking for like the first 20 hours, and then was padded with some open world stuff. But I can’t even play the crap Ubisoft puts out, from the start.
Even if you are a Harry Potter fan... the games story is horrible. The writing and dialogue delivery really is quite poor and laughable at times. Once that initial charm wears off you're left with a pretty average experience.
Honestly I think the LEGO Harry Potter games did a better job at capturing the vibe of Hogwarts better than this game did. You get more magic in either LEGO game than you do in HL at any rate.
I’ve never read a single word of the books or seen one second of the movies and I loved the game.  lol

I actually just finished replaying it. 

I loved it just as much the second time. 

But I also love Ubisoft games so I guess it’s just my type of game.
Yeah, I would say I loved it for about 20 hours but never picked it up again. 

The next game needs to focus so much more on content inside of Hogwarts. The castle itself might be the most beautiful video game area I've ever experienced. The lighting was insane on the PS5 and the interiors felt so real. Some of my fondest gaming memories of the last year was turning off all HUD elements and walking around the castle at night memorizing its layout. 

But the game needed to focus more on the fact that you're a student. There should have been people stopping you from walking around freely at night. It shouldn't have been so easy to access every part of the castle without having to slowly unlock new areas. The game starts you in your room, but that room never matters later. What house your in plays no part at all, which felt really weird. I was hoping thered be at least some reason to return to your commons. They spent so much energy making them completely gorgeous, but with nothing to do in them.
    Before launch, I thought (hoped?) the game might adopt some more Persona-esque mechanics. Not necessarily the dating sim/friendship stuff, but moreso the daily schedule and gradual unlocking of the player space.

I get why a studio would deliberately NOT want to restrict the player from *Hogwarts*.  Content gating for such a mass-appeal IP seems risky, but given a lot of Potter-heads are also readers who have the patience for story buildup, I think the devs could have exercised a bit of restraint in that regard.

Now that Hogwarts Legacy is the way that it is, the cat’s probably out of the bag on giving another Hogwarts game that structure.
        That would have been great if they went the persona route. It would have made more sense imo
    My biggest issue came when I noticed how much time I was spending in menus vs. in the game itself. Once I unlocked enough fast travel points the game loop became:  
1. Open quest log  
2. Select find on map and fast travel
3. Walk 2 minutes and do the same 4 spells  
  
I sort of want to try playing again but severely limit how much I fast travel.
    Potions felt so lacking.  Like there wasnt this interaction to make them more potent or anything.  Just toss some shit into a magical crockpot
    Yeah, it would have been cool with a Bully-esque game design. Make it feel more Hogwarts oriented with exploration on your free time.
They didn’t realize that fans would’ve rather had things to do in Hogwarts itself than more open world. The Harry Potter fantasy is being a student in Hogwarts
"Challenge: Brutally kill thousands of death eaters across the scottish highlands"
I mean after I got them, I felt there wasnt much point in not using the dark arts.

They did succeed by making a boss fight end once I hit him with an AK.
    Whoa you found the AK? I only got the shotgun, any tips?
        Automat Kalashnikova! 🪄
            In Soviet Russia Dark Arts use you.
        If you didnt have to use the AK, today was a good day.
Yeah I think a linear game with focused stories and subplots would make this game a lot more enjoyable.
Yeah ditch the open world and any of the 'features' involved with it imo (such as all the meaningless collectathon shit). Focus on the school and hogsmeade, add a bunch more student life and opportunities for role-play. Make it a 'choices matter' game with incentive to replay as a different house. That would be my perfect HP game.
To be fair it's kind of a limitation of the franchise. 

A student is not supposed to do any violent thing. When Harry and co did combat, it was to defend themselves from dark wizards attacking them and even then, they were never killing. 

But it would be kind of weird to have a video game with barely any combat.
    Generally I agree, but I'm kind of on the other side with this game. I've had a few (admittedly short) play sessions where I was just exploring the castle, talking to people, and doing side jobs, and it was pretty much fine.

If they really leaned into the immersive sim side of magic it could be really good. There are some parts of Baldur's Gate 3 where just figuring out all the interactions you can do is fun by itself. That's the real thing that drew people to the Harry Potter universe, there's barely any fighting in the first few books/movies.
        I did think a lot of what could a Harry Potter CRPG in the vein of BG3 be when playing it (the posh accent of the MC and him mentioning a Bag of Holding so many times did contribute to it lol). It could certainly be interesting and probably not that limiting for the general audience when you see how big BG3 is (it does need that AAA presentation but easy to justify for the HP license).

But on an action adventure game, I think bypassing combat or severely limiting it would be hard. They certainly could have reduced the copy paste content just increasing the duration for more combat though.
    They could have brough boss fights of magical means within the Hogwarts castle. And removing the entire HP of an enemy don't necessarily need to be a death. If they wanted, they could have surely made an appropriate game specifically for a student life. Problem is simply with the creativity of the developers of this game. All they have done is conduct basic study of other open world RPG games (only basic study, not thorough) and have implemented those mechanics pertaining to HP world.
That seems to be the general consensus and I also agree. The Hogwarts part is amazing but the open world completely dilutes the experience in the later parts of the game. It would have been much better and more interesting if they would have shrunk down the gameworld considerably to just Hogwarts and make an open castle wizard school simulator out of it.

That being said I still really liked my time with the game, it was well made. But I hope they use the assets they've made for this game to create a smaller school sim game that only focuses on all the nooks and crannies of Hogwarts and tells a more down to earth story vs the end of the world shenanigans of Hogwarts legacy.
A Bully style HP game is something I need
Totally agree. I really would have enjoyed a years long school life sim at Hogwarts. Game doesn't need to be open world like GTA.
I remember the arguments for and against it being a 'school simulator' before release. Turns out Hogwarts was the only real positive of the game and it would have been far better off as such.
    100%, would have been far more compelling to keep the gameplay more contained and the story smaller scale instead of making you out to be some proto-Harry Potter savior of the wizarding world.
This kind of criticism is pretty dumb. For example, take Ghost of Tsushima away from japan and samurais and its a completely generic ubisoft open world game. You cant just strip away the setting and style from the game...
    isn't the combat in that game more unique than the combat in any Ubisoft game ever, though?
        It's more refined and generally better, but I don't see how it's unique outside of the duels (which is admittedly cool)
    It's a refined Ubisoft game with excellent combat without the setting.
        rock paper scissors match stance to enemy type and hit the same few buttons is excellent combat? lol. a lot of style with hardly any depth. also the stealth is far worse than assassin's creed games.
right but it wasn’t made for randos, it was made for people who enjoy the universe. people have bizarre expectations for games, you aren’t getting sekiro in a harry potter universe lol

it’s a childrens series so the game is not going to be overly complex. they did a phenomenal job for an inexperienced studio and it sold extremely well. if the sequel is the exact same, then bring out the pitchforks but there are practical considerations they had to take that led to the game being what it was - a fine, forgettable experience
    Who the hell wants Sekiro, people wanted mechanics that even the first Harry Potter games had.

Or mechanics from Persona or Bully. Other kids games.
    Mario and Zelda are kids games and there’s almost always have compelling and often novel game play. Just cause something isn’t “for gamers” doesn’t mean it has to be bland.
> Take off the licensed IP veneer and it's a completely forgettable game that comes late to the genre without offering anything really new or interesting

You could say the same about like 95% of games especially in the AAA open world genre. The setting is a big part of people enjoyment of a game. 

Spider-Man is enjoyable because it's Spider-Man. Take it off and you got a generic open world game like we got dozens every year for 15 years easily.
>  If you're someone for whom the IP doesn't resonate or you've left it behind for other reasons, then Hogwarts Legacy is... just some game.

but it was made for fans, and it succeeded tremendously on that, why judge it on something it wasnt aiming for
    Because people who aren't Harry Potter fans want to know if It's a good game on It's own merits, or just a good Harry Potter fanservice game.

I get people want to defend it, but as someone who has cursory interest in the game, but am only familiar with Harry Potter from blurry memories watching the films as a kid, posts like the ones I'm seeing in this thread are helpful.

It probably succeeds at giving Harry Potter fans what they want, but if once divorced from It's IP it can't hold up to scrutiny, then a non-fan like me wouldn't want to play it.
    nothing says low quality like "it was made for the fans"
        now thats just dumb af
            "it was made for the fans" tells me there's nothing going on in it aside from the parts where you recognize a thing and start clapping like a seal.
I really wish they'd have gone more into the school stuff and less into the generic open world nonsense. Like cut it down to just the castle, forest, and hogsmeade. Drop the blandest chosen one main story. Remove room of requirements.
    I really wanted to move through the years, not start as a 5th year they somehow missed
        It honest never made much sense as to why they even picked the 5th year. Your first classes are you learning.... first year spells.
            And you only use transfiguration and potions in the RoR
Yep, this is why I liked it. I've had a rough year mental health wise and I kinda just lost myself in the countryside getting to 100%. Was it mediocre? Probably yeah. Did I enjoy it? I loved it.
People are really underselling how amazing Hogwarts Castle itself is. I can't think of a single other location in a video game that feels as much like an actual location.

Every other game has knee-high roadblocks, weird geometry with rooms being in impossible locations, building layouts that make no fucking sense, or fake doors that can't be opened and don't really exist. This doesn't really happen in Hogwarts, and it feels incredible.
>Its one of the very best games to just tune out and get lost in, Hogwarts and the surrounding country is just **that** beautiful.

I agree. I understand the criticisms, but the charm and beauty of the game for a long time Harry Potter fan more than makes up for them. I didn't go in expecting 100+ hours of content, I just wanted a cozy game to return to Hogwarts and that's what we got.
I can just zone out and grind Merlin trials and collecibles it’s kind of relaxing lol.  I could see where it’s a repetitive grind to people tho
I agree with all your points. I understand why people don’t want the open world, but it’s also beautiful and detailed and great to just kind of fly around and zone out it. I feel like it’s gonna be a game that I just come back to every once in a while to walk around the castle, walk to Hogsmeade, do a lap around the map, and put down.
    I feel like I will treat it as that kind of game if only it isn't taking up 100gb of my disk space lol
Which Star Wars movie was KOTOR based on? I'd like to see it.
    Id like to see which movie Tie Fighter was based on.
He actually said something about it approaching RDR2, not that it actually matches it. That being said, I kind of agree. Just walking around the open world is extremely compelling, even if there is nothing to find. Which is also a problem that RDR2 has, by the way.
> Terrible UX

Mouse cursors on analog sticks are truly awful

My experience with Horizon 2 is that it's great, it's huge, it has a lot to do...but it's *so* big with *so* much to do that just playing the game almost starts to feel grindy, even if nothing you're doing is particularly grindy on its own.  Kinda a weird feeling to have.
    Not really a unusual experience, sandboxes can get repetitive with time, it becomes a routine instead of just playing the game for fun. I heard the story of Horizon 2 is significantly worse if compared to the original, I take that with a grain of salt because a lot of people got upset with the supposed "woke" content, so who knows if the story is actually bad or it's just the outcry from social media bubbles... but I love the original so much, it made me upgrade the PC (little by little, I am a cheapskate, so I only bought refurbished or promotional stuff)... it's ironic really, a Sony game convincing a PC player to upgrade, you would never imagine such thing back in 2017ish. I actually played Tsushima on a friend's PS4, the game looks like Assassins Creed with a budget, but the japanese voice acting alone and the combat convinced me, I am sure Sony will release a PC port this year, there's so much money to be made

I don't think we've reached Starfield's "cold shower objective analysis" yet, we're in a weird reverse-honeymoon period where people refuse to admit the game has redeeming qualities.
Likewise with me. I haven't really dived into the Ubisoft formula much so it was pretty fresh but I did feel that stale aimless repetitive feeling towards the later half.

If they do a #2 sequel and really flesh things out, they could have quite the engaging full game.
That same person feels  very excited about being there.. spending the Hogwarts..money for very expensive rooms on the holidays!!...... seems like everyone has their thoughts crossed!!..🤷🏾‍♀️ ask ya self why
i think most games should stay away from "making it a bit persona like". it's hard to pull off, and if you don't pull it off, you end up with countless hours of boring dialogue. e.g. midnight suns

PoA was the one I had that I just kept playing over and over non stop from start to finish and getting everything to 100%.
Flying Buckbeak felt just as amazing as in the movie, and when you encounter the Dementors during the mission for fairy wings during the snow storm? I still remember all that. Good times.
Oddly the game boy colour games both had completely open Hogwarts to wanser around in despite being the most technically limited console.
Haha those are actually the only 2 Harry Potter games I had as a kid. Chamber of Secrets on GBA and Prisoner of Azkaban on PC. I don't remember Chamber of secrets being open world, but that's probably because it was the gameboy version. Prisoner of Azkaban was pretty awesome though.
Oh I spent an hour getting to a box with nothing in it except garb even Dobby wouldn't wear
    [deleted]
        Yeah the itemization was really dull, it was neat that it changed your appearance but the stats themself felt so uninteresting and boring. I would sometimes be wearing something I had found 10 new armor sets ago because nothing new was a big enough difference to consider using instead.
    Tbh this kinda reminds me of Morrowind loot where you'd kill some mini boss and he just drops an empty bottle and a chitin dagger (shittiest weapon in the game)
        [removed]
            Yeah, Skyrim is the actual offender here with constant random leveled loot making the already gamey "master chest at the end of every dungeon" more underwhelming.
Hogwarts school uniforms on everyone meanwhile we got the idiot MC running around in a tutu, bowl of fruit in their head wearing stripper boots shooting aveda kedvra down the hall from the principals office.
    That was pretty much the only good thing about the loot tbh. The stuff you could get was so hideous it was clearly deliberate. I only played because my wife is a big Harry Potter fan and it drove her nuts to watch me in serious cutscenes wearing a Hannibal Lector mask and jester outfit.
        [removed]
            Or maybe people had more fun being silly. Crazy that you went straight to discrediting them
                This game has a lot of weird fans who don't want to hear anything that sounds like criticism.
                    It's the people that don't play a lot of videogames. Not to be an elitist but most of the people that praised this game were people whose first open world game was Hogwarts Legacy, they had no frame of reference
            Why the fuck would I want to do that? The random ass gear is the best part of the game.
    There was an update very early on that let you wear any item and turn the appearance to something else. So you could wear anything and look like a normal hogwarts student.
        super annoying to change the transmog for every new item though.
            There's a mod that auto swaps for you depending on location
                ah shit, where were you 2 weeks ago? :)
                    yeah that and skipping the lockpick game are must haves
        That wasn't an update IIRC, just a feature no one paid attention to at the start.
    This is my favorite part of the game so far, tbh
Even most games are semi-random. So like if you beat a boss they make sure you're drawing from a limited list of better drops so you don't get like, a bunch of common boots or something.
I have a weird feeling and can't decide if random loot is better than set loot.

For example for me Elden ring had no replayability because it wasn't fun to do yet again a dungeon that I've done, to get the loot I already got with my first character.
I mean, it makes it easier for you to go for another kind of build but that's it.

Even in elden ring, after a while, I was bored of doing the dungeons, and I searched on the internet whhat are the drops and got the ones I cared about. So I guess in a way it makes it better because otherwise I couldn't be bothered to do every dungeon till I got the drop I wanted.

But for this game, I didn't really cared about the gear that much in a sense of "need to make a certain build". It was whatever I get if it has higher stats I'm equipping it. So I didn't mind the randomness.
    Elden Ring will probably be one of their best games to play with a randomizer, but i'm typically fine in general with replaying the games after a bit of time.

I'm looking forward to starting my 2nd playthrough once the DLC gets an actual release date.
        > Elden Ring will probably be one of their best games to play with a randomizer

My friend and I are currently on probably our 4th [randomizer](https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/428) + [seamless co-op](https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/510) run of Elden Ring. It's a blast. Most runs eventually have some funny or outrageous scenarios with enemy/boss placement.

For those reading this that are unfamiliar with Souls games randomizers: You can adjust the degree of "randomization" in several ways with the tool. Item and enemy placement are independently controlled, there's a pool of "important locations" that important items can be restricted to (and you can control which locations are considered important), or they can be sent to any random spot. There's sliders for "how random" enemies and items are. And several other tweaks and options.

Also, you can also somewhat get around the loot randomization if you decide you really want a particular item but don't know where it is. There is an option that allows you to purchase item location hints from Kale at the Church of Elle (the vendor in the church closest to the beginning of the game). Also, the randomizer has a `spoiler_logs` folder that can either provide general hints for where an item is, or it will give an exact location, without having to spend runes on hints in-game. So, if it wasn't placed too deep into late game areas while you're still in early game, you can probably go get an item to fit your build if you want.

It's a fun way to replay the game, especially with a friend using the seamless co-op mod.
    I feel like set loot adds more to the replayability. With set loot I'll know "alright so I need this armor and this sword, they are here and here so I need to figure out the best way to get there" and make a different build quickly to make the experience different. With random loot it's just annoying having to micromanage my inventory every ~10 minutes just to make sure I'm not using something worse.
    There's a difference between a randomized loot table and completely random stats. 
Randomized loot is almost always bad in my opinion. It just becomes a game of repetitive garbage collection and basically a gacha game.

I'd argue that Elden Ring probably isn't the best comparison because of the huge build variety. Loot might as well be random if you're not really planning to look anything up. Most of what you pick up isn't going to fit your build. But you'd never want the stat scaling on those items to be completely randomized where you might never get the roll you need on a certain weapon. That's just disappointing and makes you suffer through painful areas that exist only to completely waste your time.

Games need to find better ways to add replay value than having people fishing for randomized loot to pad their game time.
        For me it really depends on the game or the type of game I guess. 

I don't mind some RNG when it comes to items. For example, I loved playing a game like Destiny 2 or a MMORPG where doing a raid, wouldn't mean you'd get the item you want. (Not talking about shitty currency to craft gear, but actual gear piece).

It makes it exciting for me to play the raid over and over again to get that good, unique piece of loot and if the game is fun, the better.

I wouldn't like if that piece of gear would be a guarantee drop or if it has random stats and I need to get the same piece of gear for 1000x times till I get the stats I want.

I'm in a really weird position when it comes to these things.
    That's how I felt for replays of Elden Ring, it makes it a lot weaker for replays strictly. However that first experience with the game is so magical, finding unique loot everywhere and rewarding (even though you won't use most weaps or spells as they don't match your build). The weapons having their own moveset adds to the value on its own imo
I would take the unique set loot everywhere like Elden Ring did for an amazing first experience (100+ for me) rather than better replayability for the alternative
Also locking the Alohomora spell behind a stupid long quest line killed all my interest in exploring the open world in the beginning when every second door or chest is locked...
    Unlock Alohomora to get demiguises which is used to level up Alohomora which is used to get more demiguises which is used to level up Alohomora one more time which is used to find useless shit.
you "only" need like 50 to max out the slots I think. I looked at the map and saw only a few remaining, thought I'd go for the achievement. Little did I know that you need to "discover" them first, which I found out way too late, I was missing like ~35.
Finding out about the Merlin trials was my glass shattering moment. Literally like the Toy Story 2 “I don’t wanna play with you anymore” scene, I just lost all desire to pick the game back up.
Yeah felt the same about the Arkham Knight riddler trophies and why I've stopped playing it. Developers should really stop with these repetitive things in games, especially when it's tied to something important.
If only another particular game released this year had even that amount of variety.
Not a lot of licensed games that stand out even without the license. GoldenEye, obviously. The Arkham games and the new Spider-Man games (although it's hard to imagine someone not liking those characters and liking the gameplay). Maybe the two towers and rotk games? Maybe some of the Star wars games?
    These are good choices. Similarily I think the Mordor games would have worked on their own merit with the Nemesis system etc. It was kind of shoehorned into LotR lore anyway
        I'm not a LotR fan (liked the books, movies were fine), and I thought the first game was fun. The second game ended up being more of a slog, and I hated everything about Shelob turning into a sexy woman.
            The second one irritates me to no end because I'm quite certain that the only reason it was a slog is because WB was flagrant trying to push those orc lootboxes so the grind was padded out to absurd degrees.

Once the game fell off the radar a little bit they went back, removed the store, and reduced the grind by a whopping 30%.

How much praise would that game be getting if they had just made it fun to begin with instead of deliberately hamstringing it to push MTX?

I'd love for someone who was bored of the game to go back and re-evaluate it without all the empty calories but "hey will you go play this game you already think is incredibly boring for me?" isn't exactly a compelling sales pitch.
                I played post-lootbox and it was still grindy....but I also checked out of the story pretty quickly and just wanted to get my 100%. Whatever balance the first game had found didn't carry long into the second.
    There are tons of good licensed games in various niches even if you ignore specific franchise appeal, what people think if is always in the AAA sphere. Dragonball, Alien, TMNT, Scott Pilgrim, various Star Trek games, Riddick
    I think Republic Commando would fit, you don't have to be a fan of Star Wars to like that game. Solid shooter, squad based gameplay, good level design, etc. 

"Get some bacta Delta!"
        Republic Commando and KOTOR are the ones that could stand without the licence. Mass Effect essentially is just more modern KOTOR without the licence.

I'm a relatively good judge; I don't like Star Wars that much.
            KOTOR kinda ruined star wars for me; no other star wars media (outside of the books and comics) hits the heights of KOTOR 1 and 2 to me. They feel like they actually flesh out the star wars universe, and makes all the shows and movies a little bittersweet from not using some of the themes and in universe things that KOTOR established.
                I agree totally. The films feel flat compared to how richly the setting can be opened up in an RPG. Beyond the corporate meddling and the simply formulaic storytelling (present across the series tbh), the films simply don't have enough time to get into it - and are restricted by making it kid-friendly.

There's such an opportunity for a modern KoTOR, especially after the success of BG3. I just don't want EA to have anything to do with it beyond handing it off to a talented studio.
            I'm surprised to hear that Kotor lands. That feels like you have to like Star Wars to like it, to me
                KOTOR benefits from being, well, set in the Old Republic. The barrier to entry is just “liking sci-fi” and then the only concepts you really need to know about from Star Wars are lightsabers and Force powers, everything else is pretty self contained.
                    I think it could be a barrier if you've literally seen 0 star wars. But even just a movie or two and you've gotten enough of an intro for KOTOR.

And I mean... It's gotta be a majority of western audiences that have seen a (single) star wars movie... right?
                Nah, honestly Star Wars benefits from being a fairly generic setting.

So it was actually rare that you needed to be a fan of the series, to like any of the games. Since most were their own thing separate from the movies.

Most of the games could've been a new IP. These games like KOTOR or Rougue Squadron just happen to have Star Wars themes/skins.
    Arkham and Spider-Man games are totally reliant on the franchise though. It's fun BECAUSE you play those superheroes. And they're frankly very similar to Hogwarts Legacy in being a "generic open world" by the way (they have better stories though)
        I would disagree. I think removing the franchise the games would still be fun. If Spidey had a zip line instead of web, it would still be fun to zoot around the city and I don't think I've seen any Batman media where he just hangs around on gargoyles.
            I mean if you remove the franchise you remove the whole gadgets, combat system as it is, the traversal system for both games, the story, the enemies type, the environments... (all of this come from the franchise) and you're left with the template of an open world game, exactly like with Hogwarts Legacy. 

I don't see how that's different. Games are carried by their setting all the time (it can be a franchise but also just something like Ghost of Tsushima carried by the medieval Japan setting executed very well or Horizon by the robot dinosaurs to fight)
                I mean you are removing gameplay in those examples. There is no reason why you can't keep the elements that are from the franchise.

There was a game, whose name escapes me now, developed a few years ago that was made by someone who worked on the Spider-Man 2 movie tie in game. It was basically about web slinging but with no Spider-man, they just used a grapple gadget to create the same effect. The Arkham game could easily be reskinned as a Ninja game. Tonnes of games give the players gadgets to use, so it is not uniquely Batman.
    The Scott pilgrim videogame is a really solid side-scrolling beat 'em up, which was made for the movie.
        I am just playing it wrong or is that game really difficult? I've put a bunch of time into it and I still can't get passed the second level?
            If you have a second controller you can do some cheats to give yourself a bunch of money and get a bunch of upgrades in the first level. 

(link for the cheat: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDxTcptNT9Q)

But yeah the game is kinda difficult at first, unless you get a bunch of upgrades.
                Ah, okay. Thanks. I was really surprised I was making little to no progress and I felt I couldn't use other characters because they weren't leveled. Good to know I'm not mad and grinding is part of the game.
The only IP game that holds up regardless of fandom is Shrek Superslam, because it's mechanically just so fucking awesome and a ton of fun.
Yeah they definitely should have scaled it back a lot. Keep Hogwarts, Hogsmeade, the Forbidden Forest, and a little bit of the area around Hogwarts and Hogsmeade (Upper and Lower Hogsfield).
    Or even keep everything up until that lower portion of the map with the coastline that doesn't open up until like past halfway through the game. The rest of the world was pretty awesome to explore or just fly around in, and that initial area of the map localized within the first half of the game felt like a great size. The moment the bottom part of the map was when the burnout started to creep in for me. That was a little overwhelming and pretty unnecessary even for the story.
        Agreed. What was even down there? Plus with a map that big I had zero desire to fly there. I’d literally fast travel to the nearest marker and then fly.
    That was my assumption. No reason they couldn't just add places as they go with more content, themes/biomes or whatever, etc.
    I loved the size. It was nice seeing the grounds around and flying, as that’s the world that Hogwarts exists in and it’s amazing to explore. It feels odd in this day to be artificially kept to the castle. 

That said they just needed better mechanics, story, and things to fill said world with.
What you’re describing (the game you wanted) sounds more like the Lego Harry Potter games actually.
Reminds me the early days of the PS3 generation, the open world games had to be bigger and bigger, this sequel has 3x the size if compared to the original, blablabla even to this day some games repeats that concept, which is dumb, if I'm not mistaken it was leaked that GTA 6 map will be 2x bigger than Red Dead 2. Size just for the sake of it, bloat without meaningful content
    >if I'm not mistaken it was leaked that GTA 6 map will be 2x bigger than Red Dead 2. 

I'm fine with that, it's fun to explore the map with a car, go several minutes at top speed on highways, etc. Just hope they make a balanced map instead of a map like 5's that has one big city and fuck all in the rest of it.
        It depends if the traversal is fun or not. I honestly had a big smile on my face when they announced Spider-Man 2 would be way bigger, the game will feature a extra island, etc.. because I love to move around in that game, never used quick travel. As for GTA, I am not a big fan of the moon physiques, so the leak kinda disappointed me a little bit. Red Dead 2 works because the horse riding feels relaxing, also the realistic physiques can lead to some goofy situations. GTA is all over the place, you touch a little obstacle and the car catapults in the air... I know a lot of people love this, but I am not a big fan tbh
    The thing with GTA is that the gameplay usually helps or goes nicely with the increased size of the map. Especially as those games go for the more outlandish approach to open-world gameplay design. Whereas RDR2 went down the ultra-realism route of "look how painful & difficult it was to live in those times!" which whilst interesting to play...becomes a slog when you only have short periods of time to play.
        That’s fair but I will die on the hill that rdr2 is a top game of all time.
        > which whilst interesting to play...becomes a slog when you only have short periods of time to play.

Never felt that way to me. I could've played forever.
        > which whilst interesting to play...becomes a slog when you only have short periods of time to play.

Honestly RDR2 might be the slowest game, that doesn't feel like a slog at all. I could have played that game for another 200 hours if there was something to do. Very very relaxing game.

But tbh, Rockstar's approach of any of these "realism" things is always fake as fuck. You never needed to worry about eating, warm, or anything like that. They're honestly like genuine role playing mechanics, easy to ignore, but if you wish to play grizzled country cowboy, you can.
        I am in the minority, I prefer the "realistic" gameplay of Red Dead if compared to the moon physiques of GTA. In the end, it all depends if the traversal is fun, if the map is filled with interesting stuff, etc.. for example, I did not liked how Rocksteady announced Arkham Knight will have 3x the size of Arkham City, they will include the batmobile as the novelty, etc.. in the end, Arkham Knight has a boring map and the excess of batmobile can be annoying, the bloated size did not helped that game imo (and Arkham Origins suffers even more on this regard). 

And I am excited to play Horizon 2 on PC... but I hope this game will be just slightly bigger than the original, the traversal in Horizon can feel like a slog sometimes, the devs have to exercise some parsimony, sometimes less is more... Tears of the Kingdom is another example, the "depths" are just so fucking boring! First time you enter the "depths", it's amazing, scary, etc.. but when you go there for the 10th time... or even worse, if you are actually trying to unlock every "light tree" to reveal the whole map, it's a goddamn slog, way worse than Red Dead 2 or any other open world game I've played tbh
I agree. It’s still fun and charming but after 25 hours i shelved it.
Agreed, I'm getting bored of these quantity over quality open world games. Give me a few dense, well-crafted areas over a big ass map that I'll just end up flying over.
Jedi Survivor really impressed me with that - I was really disappointed with that aspect of JFO (though I loved it overall) so it was nice to see Respawn take the criticism to heart and greatly improve the variety of cosmetics and stuff. 

I think a Hogwarts 2 should make regular chests cosmetic gear only and then have set loot "artifact" pieces of gear in bespoke, handcrafted dungeons. Make those pieces have specific quests or legends associated with them, like maybe you hear about an ancient wizard that lost his magical locket in a cave. Then you KNOW when you seek it out or happen across it during exploration that it's going to give you a really unique buff or ability and not just "+10% chomping cabbage damage" or whatever.
> multiply the social aspect of going to school and interacting with your classmates by 5 times (hello persona has been around for decades you can take inspiration or just copy).

Bully too, while Bully wasn't in depth in terms of classmate interaction.

You literally had to go to school in that game, you had to be at your first class by a certain time or you were truant. You could fail classes.

I was a little disappointed seeing such a fleshed out Hogwarts interior, only for it, to not really be used.
Lore wise it felt kind of hamfisted too. The books and movies seem like Hogwarts is well hidden and isolated from pretty much everywhere but Hogsmeade, yet in this game its surrounded for miles by bustling wizarding villages and hamlets. 

Maybe the time difference in setting would explain it but it still doesn't seem right
    I don’t think it really contradicts much, the villages shown in the game are all quite small. It seems reasonable to me that there would be other wizards living out away from muggle civilization.
    On the whole country, the area we explore is still very small, it's the outskirts of Hogwarts which are without Muggles so it makes sense wizards are installed there (though why they aren't all at Hogsmeade is kind of weird, it's not like it's so huge you can't find room anymore...)
Agree except the combat, I don't feel like it was very generic. Sure it had the Arkham button counter system but you could mix and match your spells to good effect, making some creative combos, and the enemies even had weak points like pulling the frog's tongue out with a specific spell etc. It was probably one of the best parts of the game. 

The only thing is the loot system and enemy variety betrayed it, in a sequel with actual meaningful gear traits you could have much more build flexibility and way cooler spell augments that would give even more variety on top of more enemies to fight.
Yeah the thing is that the game outstayed its welcome and I have a dozen memories of amazing moments in hogwarts and hogsmeade and remember like nothing about the rest of the game. Because of everything else, the combat which started amazing gets stale.

I feel like it was padded as an afterthought to give you more to do with the broom and flying beasts, but it’s unnecessary. If they lost most of that stuff, and instead added quidditch and let you floo powder to diagon alley, it would be an almost perfect game.
The only Harry Potter stuff I've interacted with was watching Deathly Hallows 2 with some friends in a theater, but I still thoroughly enjoyed Hogwarts Legacy.
Ubisoft kinda made that template for gameplay though. 

This game is a toolbox of rpg mechanics. 
-talent tree
-crafting 
-collecting
-gear with rarity and upgrades
-challenges
-exploring rewards
-fetch quests
-leveling
-cosmetics
-good and evil story choices

Ubisoft gets called out a lot because they’ve been using this toolbox approach for a long time. The criticism is that they should focus more on quality and not quantity, instead of doing a presenting a toll box of rpg mechanics under a licensed IP. They didn’t create something new and innovative. 

 I still love it though! It scratches all the mental ticks for rpg players.

        I don't know how the last three or so years have led from the Ubisoft Formula meaning "climbing towers, clearing outposts, unlocking chunks of the map, collect 100 doodads, etc." and has become "anything that is an open world action RPG."
    Ubisoft just has two series that follow it which is the same as other publishers regularly doing those games. 

I mean people are clamoring for Horizon, Spider-Man or Ghost of Tsushima for example (all from the same publisher). They're following that exact same formula. The Witcher 3 or Cyberpunk are praised as masterpieces, they're doing that too. Skyrim did it too. Even GTA is kind of that (no gear but the Ubisoft open world thing is from even before AC got gear). 

There are more games following that formula not done by Ubisoft than by them. It's basically the open world template/genre, I'm not sure what people want. Even stuff like Elden Ring or Breath of the Wild just have a variation of it.
    You just described le 9/10 Reddit favorite Spider-Man 2
        I mean yes but Spider-Man 2 isn't bloated to hell. Its like 20-30 hours to do litteraly everything, MAX.
This. Ubisoft formula is a thing because it works. It is up to the individual game whether or not they pull it off well and make each reptitive experience still feel engaging and unique.
    How do people still not get this?

Ubisoft has been selling games and making bank for 15 years using this formula. And dozens of other studios used it well and made bank too.

Its like complaining about too many sitcoms in TV. Like, what?
        Remember folks, it's only a "Ubisoft-style game" if you don't like it!

That's why *Ghost of Tsushima* and *Horizon: Forbidden West* get a pass.
            
Both of those games are frequently called Ubisoft games.

GoT ruined AC for me, because it's just AC without most of the Ubisoft game design garbage that infests their open world games.
                Not going to lie but I got sick of GoTs foxes fairly quick.
            Not to mention that the first Ubisoft-style game was Witcher 3 lol
                It was AC1...
        It's the Reddit echo chamber vs the rest of the world, criticizing the Ubisoft formula is fair but one has to realize that 90% of people don't give a shit
            Meh. Both Elden Ring and Breath of the Wild to a certain extent steered away from the traditional Ubisoft open world formula and people love those games all the more for it.
                That has nothing to do with what I said. Ubisoft formula games consistently sell well because most gamers don't dislike the formula, even though you'd think most people do based on Reddit.
                    They don't sell as well as Elden Ring, BOTW, RDR2, GTA though.

It has a lot to do with what you said. The Ubisoft design formula isn't the biggest problem, but the phoned in lazy approach to these games does not generate the sales that the high quality open world games do.

They still sell well, but even Ubi doesn't report the actual sales data of mainline AC anymore. They now do revenue.
                        >They don't sell as well as Elden Ring, BOTW, RDR2, GTA though.

You're just moving the goalposts here. The formula is successful, that's my point, and saying it's not as successful as some of the best selling open world games doesn't change that.
            >criticizing the Ubisoft formula is fair but one has to realize that 90% of people don't give a shit

So? Why is there a contingency of people on this website who think "This thing made a lot of money so you can't criticize it! You're just a stinky Redditor!" is some major own?
                >This thing made a lot of money so you can't criticize it!

I literally said, and I quote, "criticizing the Ubisoft formula is fair", in my comment.

If you can't read maybe don't go on forums?
                    And yet you immediately follow that sentence uo with, to paraphrase 'lol who gives a shit'.
                        That's not a paraphrase, that's a strawman.

I said 90% of people don't care, because we were talking about how much criticism the formula gets on Reddit yet how successful it seems to be.

Once again, if you can't read then don't go on forums.
                            You're expanding on what you said, not quoting yourself. It'd be useful for you to actually know what a paraphrase in this scenario is, huh?

Oh the irony of chastising someone for not reading while flat out having to concede you did not articulate yourself well enough the first go-around.
        Also its not like Ubisoft did suddenly bring this concept up and now everyone uses it. 


This formula has been going for decades and just gets more and more expended. 


Even in games like Gothic 1 and 2 you can find plenty of game play elements that are associated with today's "generic Ubisoft Title".


Basically all open world games have always lived and worked with the same patterns for like 25 years now.
        A lot of reddit commenters are insecure children who don't feel like they should like what's popular. Everything has to be counter to the culture in order to feel special and unique.
        The "Ubisoft formula" is basically the open world game design lol. Literally every open world game follow that formula with more or less variation on it (yes even Elden Ring or Breath of the Wild do)
            Nah that's GTA3 or even Mario 64 design.

Many open world games don't have any Ubisoft design philosophy in them.

Ubisoft design is specifically the defeat the copy/paste base > climb the tower gameplay loop they made in AC and Far Cry. That's what people mean.

BOTW and Elden Ring of course both do this. But plenty do not.
I actually just beat the game recently and I thought to myself, would I recommend this to someone who is not a Harry Potter fan? And I said no. The game itself is pretty mediocre but serviceable enough if you like the wizarding world.

But to answer your question about generic ubisoft game, to me this is basically open world filled with cookie cutter map marker objectives. So they made a huge map, but filled it with boring content like merlin trials, raid/poacher camps, broom balloons, butterfly chests, ancient magic thing, and whatever else was on there. I like the content in the game to be unique enough so that I never feel like its repetitive. Most games just go overboard and do this like any assassins creed and far cry. Even popular games like witcher 3 and spiderman. The one game I think did it pretty great was ghost of tsushima, it didn't feel like it over stayed its welcome and that is a bit ironic since its basically the assassins creed game ubisoft wished it could make.
This game is so much fucking better than an ubisoft game. Those games are immediately boring and repetitive, 100% filler. Hogwarts was outstanding and breathtaking for like the first 20 hours, and then was padded with some open world stuff. But I can’t even play the crap Ubisoft puts out, from the start.
Before launch, I thought (hoped?) the game might adopt some more Persona-esque mechanics. Not necessarily the dating sim/friendship stuff, but moreso the daily schedule and gradual unlocking of the player space.

I get why a studio would deliberately NOT want to restrict the player from *Hogwarts*.  Content gating for such a mass-appeal IP seems risky, but given a lot of Potter-heads are also readers who have the patience for story buildup, I think the devs could have exercised a bit of restraint in that regard.

Now that Hogwarts Legacy is the way that it is, the cat’s probably out of the bag on giving another Hogwarts game that structure.
    That would have been great if they went the persona route. It would have made more sense imo
My biggest issue came when I noticed how much time I was spending in menus vs. in the game itself. Once I unlocked enough fast travel points the game loop became:  
1. Open quest log  
2. Select find on map and fast travel
3. Walk 2 minutes and do the same 4 spells  
  
I sort of want to try playing again but severely limit how much I fast travel.
Potions felt so lacking.  Like there wasnt this interaction to make them more potent or anything.  Just toss some shit into a magical crockpot
Yeah, it would have been cool with a Bully-esque game design. Make it feel more Hogwarts oriented with exploration on your free time.
Whoa you found the AK? I only got the shotgun, any tips?
    Automat Kalashnikova! 🪄
        In Soviet Russia Dark Arts use you.
    If you didnt have to use the AK, today was a good day.
Generally I agree, but I'm kind of on the other side with this game. I've had a few (admittedly short) play sessions where I was just exploring the castle, talking to people, and doing side jobs, and it was pretty much fine.

If they really leaned into the immersive sim side of magic it could be really good. There are some parts of Baldur's Gate 3 where just figuring out all the interactions you can do is fun by itself. That's the real thing that drew people to the Harry Potter universe, there's barely any fighting in the first few books/movies.
    I did think a lot of what could a Harry Potter CRPG in the vein of BG3 be when playing it (the posh accent of the MC and him mentioning a Bag of Holding so many times did contribute to it lol). It could certainly be interesting and probably not that limiting for the general audience when you see how big BG3 is (it does need that AAA presentation but easy to justify for the HP license).

But on an action adventure game, I think bypassing combat or severely limiting it would be hard. They certainly could have reduced the copy paste content just increasing the duration for more combat though.
They could have brough boss fights of magical means within the Hogwarts castle. And removing the entire HP of an enemy don't necessarily need to be a death. If they wanted, they could have surely made an appropriate game specifically for a student life. Problem is simply with the creativity of the developers of this game. All they have done is conduct basic study of other open world RPG games (only basic study, not thorough) and have implemented those mechanics pertaining to HP world.
100%, would have been far more compelling to keep the gameplay more contained and the story smaller scale instead of making you out to be some proto-Harry Potter savior of the wizarding world.
isn't the combat in that game more unique than the combat in any Ubisoft game ever, though?
    It's more refined and generally better, but I don't see how it's unique outside of the duels (which is admittedly cool)
It's a refined Ubisoft game with excellent combat without the setting.
    rock paper scissors match stance to enemy type and hit the same few buttons is excellent combat? lol. a lot of style with hardly any depth. also the stealth is far worse than assassin's creed games.
Who the hell wants Sekiro, people wanted mechanics that even the first Harry Potter games had.

Or mechanics from Persona or Bully. Other kids games.
Mario and Zelda are kids games and there’s almost always have compelling and often novel game play. Just cause something isn’t “for gamers” doesn’t mean it has to be bland.
Because people who aren't Harry Potter fans want to know if It's a good game on It's own merits, or just a good Harry Potter fanservice game.

I get people want to defend it, but as someone who has cursory interest in the game, but am only familiar with Harry Potter from blurry memories watching the films as a kid, posts like the ones I'm seeing in this thread are helpful.

It probably succeeds at giving Harry Potter fans what they want, but if once divorced from It's IP it can't hold up to scrutiny, then a non-fan like me wouldn't want to play it.
nothing says low quality like "it was made for the fans"
    now thats just dumb af
        "it was made for the fans" tells me there's nothing going on in it aside from the parts where you recognize a thing and start clapping like a seal.
I really wanted to move through the years, not start as a 5th year they somehow missed
    It honest never made much sense as to why they even picked the 5th year. Your first classes are you learning.... first year spells.
        And you only use transfiguration and potions in the RoR
I feel like I will treat it as that kind of game if only it isn't taking up 100gb of my disk space lol
Id like to see which movie Tie Fighter was based on.
Not really a unusual experience, sandboxes can get repetitive with time, it becomes a routine instead of just playing the game for fun. I heard the story of Horizon 2 is significantly worse if compared to the original, I take that with a grain of salt because a lot of people got upset with the supposed "woke" content, so who knows if the story is actually bad or it's just the outcry from social media bubbles... but I love the original so much, it made me upgrade the PC (little by little, I am a cheapskate, so I only bought refurbished or promotional stuff)... it's ironic really, a Sony game convincing a PC player to upgrade, you would never imagine such thing back in 2017ish. I actually played Tsushima on a friend's PS4, the game looks like Assassins Creed with a budget, but the japanese voice acting alone and the combat convinced me, I am sure Sony will release a PC port this year, there's so much money to be made

    Yeah the itemization was really dull, it was neat that it changed your appearance but the stats themself felt so uninteresting and boring. I would sometimes be wearing something I had found 10 new armor sets ago because nothing new was a big enough difference to consider using instead.
Tbh this kinda reminds me of Morrowind loot where you'd kill some mini boss and he just drops an empty bottle and a chitin dagger (shittiest weapon in the game)
    [removed]
        Yeah, Skyrim is the actual offender here with constant random leveled loot making the already gamey "master chest at the end of every dungeon" more underwhelming.
That was pretty much the only good thing about the loot tbh. The stuff you could get was so hideous it was clearly deliberate. I only played because my wife is a big Harry Potter fan and it drove her nuts to watch me in serious cutscenes wearing a Hannibal Lector mask and jester outfit.
    [removed]
        Or maybe people had more fun being silly. Crazy that you went straight to discrediting them
            This game has a lot of weird fans who don't want to hear anything that sounds like criticism.
                It's the people that don't play a lot of videogames. Not to be an elitist but most of the people that praised this game were people whose first open world game was Hogwarts Legacy, they had no frame of reference
        Why the fuck would I want to do that? The random ass gear is the best part of the game.
There was an update very early on that let you wear any item and turn the appearance to something else. So you could wear anything and look like a normal hogwarts student.
    super annoying to change the transmog for every new item though.
        There's a mod that auto swaps for you depending on location
            ah shit, where were you 2 weeks ago? :)
                yeah that and skipping the lockpick game are must haves
    That wasn't an update IIRC, just a feature no one paid attention to at the start.
This is my favorite part of the game so far, tbh
Elden Ring will probably be one of their best games to play with a randomizer, but i'm typically fine in general with replaying the games after a bit of time.

I'm looking forward to starting my 2nd playthrough once the DLC gets an actual release date.
    > Elden Ring will probably be one of their best games to play with a randomizer

My friend and I are currently on probably our 4th [randomizer](https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/428) + [seamless co-op](https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/510) run of Elden Ring. It's a blast. Most runs eventually have some funny or outrageous scenarios with enemy/boss placement.

For those reading this that are unfamiliar with Souls games randomizers: You can adjust the degree of "randomization" in several ways with the tool. Item and enemy placement are independently controlled, there's a pool of "important locations" that important items can be restricted to (and you can control which locations are considered important), or they can be sent to any random spot. There's sliders for "how random" enemies and items are. And several other tweaks and options.

Also, you can also somewhat get around the loot randomization if you decide you really want a particular item but don't know where it is. There is an option that allows you to purchase item location hints from Kale at the Church of Elle (the vendor in the church closest to the beginning of the game). Also, the randomizer has a `spoiler_logs` folder that can either provide general hints for where an item is, or it will give an exact location, without having to spend runes on hints in-game. So, if it wasn't placed too deep into late game areas while you're still in early game, you can probably go get an item to fit your build if you want.

It's a fun way to replay the game, especially with a friend using the seamless co-op mod.
I feel like set loot adds more to the replayability. With set loot I'll know "alright so I need this armor and this sword, they are here and here so I need to figure out the best way to get there" and make a different build quickly to make the experience different. With random loot it's just annoying having to micromanage my inventory every ~10 minutes just to make sure I'm not using something worse.
There's a difference between a randomized loot table and completely random stats. 
Randomized loot is almost always bad in my opinion. It just becomes a game of repetitive garbage collection and basically a gacha game.

I'd argue that Elden Ring probably isn't the best comparison because of the huge build variety. Loot might as well be random if you're not really planning to look anything up. Most of what you pick up isn't going to fit your build. But you'd never want the stat scaling on those items to be completely randomized where you might never get the roll you need on a certain weapon. That's just disappointing and makes you suffer through painful areas that exist only to completely waste your time.

Games need to find better ways to add replay value than having people fishing for randomized loot to pad their game time.
    For me it really depends on the game or the type of game I guess. 

I don't mind some RNG when it comes to items. For example, I loved playing a game like Destiny 2 or a MMORPG where doing a raid, wouldn't mean you'd get the item you want. (Not talking about shitty currency to craft gear, but actual gear piece).

It makes it exciting for me to play the raid over and over again to get that good, unique piece of loot and if the game is fun, the better.

I wouldn't like if that piece of gear would be a guarantee drop or if it has random stats and I need to get the same piece of gear for 1000x times till I get the stats I want.

I'm in a really weird position when it comes to these things.
That's how I felt for replays of Elden Ring, it makes it a lot weaker for replays strictly. However that first experience with the game is so magical, finding unique loot everywhere and rewarding (even though you won't use most weaps or spells as they don't match your build). The weapons having their own moveset adds to the value on its own imo
I would take the unique set loot everywhere like Elden Ring did for an amazing first experience (100+ for me) rather than better replayability for the alternative
Unlock Alohomora to get demiguises which is used to level up Alohomora which is used to get more demiguises which is used to level up Alohomora one more time which is used to find useless shit.
These are good choices. Similarily I think the Mordor games would have worked on their own merit with the Nemesis system etc. It was kind of shoehorned into LotR lore anyway
    I'm not a LotR fan (liked the books, movies were fine), and I thought the first game was fun. The second game ended up being more of a slog, and I hated everything about Shelob turning into a sexy woman.
        The second one irritates me to no end because I'm quite certain that the only reason it was a slog is because WB was flagrant trying to push those orc lootboxes so the grind was padded out to absurd degrees.

Once the game fell off the radar a little bit they went back, removed the store, and reduced the grind by a whopping 30%.

How much praise would that game be getting if they had just made it fun to begin with instead of deliberately hamstringing it to push MTX?

I'd love for someone who was bored of the game to go back and re-evaluate it without all the empty calories but "hey will you go play this game you already think is incredibly boring for me?" isn't exactly a compelling sales pitch.
            I played post-lootbox and it was still grindy....but I also checked out of the story pretty quickly and just wanted to get my 100%. Whatever balance the first game had found didn't carry long into the second.
There are tons of good licensed games in various niches even if you ignore specific franchise appeal, what people think if is always in the AAA sphere. Dragonball, Alien, TMNT, Scott Pilgrim, various Star Trek games, Riddick
I think Republic Commando would fit, you don't have to be a fan of Star Wars to like that game. Solid shooter, squad based gameplay, good level design, etc. 

"Get some bacta Delta!"
    Republic Commando and KOTOR are the ones that could stand without the licence. Mass Effect essentially is just more modern KOTOR without the licence.

I'm a relatively good judge; I don't like Star Wars that much.
        KOTOR kinda ruined star wars for me; no other star wars media (outside of the books and comics) hits the heights of KOTOR 1 and 2 to me. They feel like they actually flesh out the star wars universe, and makes all the shows and movies a little bittersweet from not using some of the themes and in universe things that KOTOR established.
            I agree totally. The films feel flat compared to how richly the setting can be opened up in an RPG. Beyond the corporate meddling and the simply formulaic storytelling (present across the series tbh), the films simply don't have enough time to get into it - and are restricted by making it kid-friendly.

There's such an opportunity for a modern KoTOR, especially after the success of BG3. I just don't want EA to have anything to do with it beyond handing it off to a talented studio.
        I'm surprised to hear that Kotor lands. That feels like you have to like Star Wars to like it, to me
            KOTOR benefits from being, well, set in the Old Republic. The barrier to entry is just “liking sci-fi” and then the only concepts you really need to know about from Star Wars are lightsabers and Force powers, everything else is pretty self contained.
                I think it could be a barrier if you've literally seen 0 star wars. But even just a movie or two and you've gotten enough of an intro for KOTOR.

And I mean... It's gotta be a majority of western audiences that have seen a (single) star wars movie... right?
            Nah, honestly Star Wars benefits from being a fairly generic setting.

So it was actually rare that you needed to be a fan of the series, to like any of the games. Since most were their own thing separate from the movies.

Most of the games could've been a new IP. These games like KOTOR or Rougue Squadron just happen to have Star Wars themes/skins.
Arkham and Spider-Man games are totally reliant on the franchise though. It's fun BECAUSE you play those superheroes. And they're frankly very similar to Hogwarts Legacy in being a "generic open world" by the way (they have better stories though)
    I would disagree. I think removing the franchise the games would still be fun. If Spidey had a zip line instead of web, it would still be fun to zoot around the city and I don't think I've seen any Batman media where he just hangs around on gargoyles.
        I mean if you remove the franchise you remove the whole gadgets, combat system as it is, the traversal system for both games, the story, the enemies type, the environments... (all of this come from the franchise) and you're left with the template of an open world game, exactly like with Hogwarts Legacy. 

I don't see how that's different. Games are carried by their setting all the time (it can be a franchise but also just something like Ghost of Tsushima carried by the medieval Japan setting executed very well or Horizon by the robot dinosaurs to fight)
            I mean you are removing gameplay in those examples. There is no reason why you can't keep the elements that are from the franchise.

There was a game, whose name escapes me now, developed a few years ago that was made by someone who worked on the Spider-Man 2 movie tie in game. It was basically about web slinging but with no Spider-man, they just used a grapple gadget to create the same effect. The Arkham game could easily be reskinned as a Ninja game. Tonnes of games give the players gadgets to use, so it is not uniquely Batman.
The Scott pilgrim videogame is a really solid side-scrolling beat 'em up, which was made for the movie.
    I am just playing it wrong or is that game really difficult? I've put a bunch of time into it and I still can't get passed the second level?
        If you have a second controller you can do some cheats to give yourself a bunch of money and get a bunch of upgrades in the first level. 

(link for the cheat: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDxTcptNT9Q)

But yeah the game is kinda difficult at first, unless you get a bunch of upgrades.
            Ah, okay. Thanks. I was really surprised I was making little to no progress and I felt I couldn't use other characters because they weren't leveled. Good to know I'm not mad and grinding is part of the game.
Or even keep everything up until that lower portion of the map with the coastline that doesn't open up until like past halfway through the game. The rest of the world was pretty awesome to explore or just fly around in, and that initial area of the map localized within the first half of the game felt like a great size. The moment the bottom part of the map was when the burnout started to creep in for me. That was a little overwhelming and pretty unnecessary even for the story.
    Agreed. What was even down there? Plus with a map that big I had zero desire to fly there. I’d literally fast travel to the nearest marker and then fly.
That was my assumption. No reason they couldn't just add places as they go with more content, themes/biomes or whatever, etc.
I loved the size. It was nice seeing the grounds around and flying, as that’s the world that Hogwarts exists in and it’s amazing to explore. It feels odd in this day to be artificially kept to the castle. 

That said they just needed better mechanics, story, and things to fill said world with.
>if I'm not mistaken it was leaked that GTA 6 map will be 2x bigger than Red Dead 2. 

I'm fine with that, it's fun to explore the map with a car, go several minutes at top speed on highways, etc. Just hope they make a balanced map instead of a map like 5's that has one big city and fuck all in the rest of it.
    It depends if the traversal is fun or not. I honestly had a big smile on my face when they announced Spider-Man 2 would be way bigger, the game will feature a extra island, etc.. because I love to move around in that game, never used quick travel. As for GTA, I am not a big fan of the moon physiques, so the leak kinda disappointed me a little bit. Red Dead 2 works because the horse riding feels relaxing, also the realistic physiques can lead to some goofy situations. GTA is all over the place, you touch a little obstacle and the car catapults in the air... I know a lot of people love this, but I am not a big fan tbh
The thing with GTA is that the gameplay usually helps or goes nicely with the increased size of the map. Especially as those games go for the more outlandish approach to open-world gameplay design. Whereas RDR2 went down the ultra-realism route of "look how painful & difficult it was to live in those times!" which whilst interesting to play...becomes a slog when you only have short periods of time to play.
    That’s fair but I will die on the hill that rdr2 is a top game of all time.
    > which whilst interesting to play...becomes a slog when you only have short periods of time to play.

Never felt that way to me. I could've played forever.
    > which whilst interesting to play...becomes a slog when you only have short periods of time to play.

Honestly RDR2 might be the slowest game, that doesn't feel like a slog at all. I could have played that game for another 200 hours if there was something to do. Very very relaxing game.

But tbh, Rockstar's approach of any of these "realism" things is always fake as fuck. You never needed to worry about eating, warm, or anything like that. They're honestly like genuine role playing mechanics, easy to ignore, but if you wish to play grizzled country cowboy, you can.
    I am in the minority, I prefer the "realistic" gameplay of Red Dead if compared to the moon physiques of GTA. In the end, it all depends if the traversal is fun, if the map is filled with interesting stuff, etc.. for example, I did not liked how Rocksteady announced Arkham Knight will have 3x the size of Arkham City, they will include the batmobile as the novelty, etc.. in the end, Arkham Knight has a boring map and the excess of batmobile can be annoying, the bloated size did not helped that game imo (and Arkham Origins suffers even more on this regard). 

And I am excited to play Horizon 2 on PC... but I hope this game will be just slightly bigger than the original, the traversal in Horizon can feel like a slog sometimes, the devs have to exercise some parsimony, sometimes less is more... Tears of the Kingdom is another example, the "depths" are just so fucking boring! First time you enter the "depths", it's amazing, scary, etc.. but when you go there for the 10th time... or even worse, if you are actually trying to unlock every "light tree" to reveal the whole map, it's a goddamn slog, way worse than Red Dead 2 or any other open world game I've played tbh
I don’t think it really contradicts much, the villages shown in the game are all quite small. It seems reasonable to me that there would be other wizards living out away from muggle civilization.
On the whole country, the area we explore is still very small, it's the outskirts of Hogwarts which are without Muggles so it makes sense wizards are installed there (though why they aren't all at Hogsmeade is kind of weird, it's not like it's so huge you can't find room anymore...)

    I don't know how the last three or so years have led from the Ubisoft Formula meaning "climbing towers, clearing outposts, unlocking chunks of the map, collect 100 doodads, etc." and has become "anything that is an open world action RPG."
Ubisoft just has two series that follow it which is the same as other publishers regularly doing those games. 

I mean people are clamoring for Horizon, Spider-Man or Ghost of Tsushima for example (all from the same publisher). They're following that exact same formula. The Witcher 3 or Cyberpunk are praised as masterpieces, they're doing that too. Skyrim did it too. Even GTA is kind of that (no gear but the Ubisoft open world thing is from even before AC got gear). 

There are more games following that formula not done by Ubisoft than by them. It's basically the open world template/genre, I'm not sure what people want. Even stuff like Elden Ring or Breath of the Wild just have a variation of it.
You just described le 9/10 Reddit favorite Spider-Man 2
    I mean yes but Spider-Man 2 isn't bloated to hell. Its like 20-30 hours to do litteraly everything, MAX.
How do people still not get this?

Ubisoft has been selling games and making bank for 15 years using this formula. And dozens of other studios used it well and made bank too.

Its like complaining about too many sitcoms in TV. Like, what?
    Remember folks, it's only a "Ubisoft-style game" if you don't like it!

That's why *Ghost of Tsushima* and *Horizon: Forbidden West* get a pass.
        
Both of those games are frequently called Ubisoft games.

GoT ruined AC for me, because it's just AC without most of the Ubisoft game design garbage that infests their open world games.
            Not going to lie but I got sick of GoTs foxes fairly quick.
        Not to mention that the first Ubisoft-style game was Witcher 3 lol
            It was AC1...
    It's the Reddit echo chamber vs the rest of the world, criticizing the Ubisoft formula is fair but one has to realize that 90% of people don't give a shit
        Meh. Both Elden Ring and Breath of the Wild to a certain extent steered away from the traditional Ubisoft open world formula and people love those games all the more for it.
            That has nothing to do with what I said. Ubisoft formula games consistently sell well because most gamers don't dislike the formula, even though you'd think most people do based on Reddit.
                They don't sell as well as Elden Ring, BOTW, RDR2, GTA though.

It has a lot to do with what you said. The Ubisoft design formula isn't the biggest problem, but the phoned in lazy approach to these games does not generate the sales that the high quality open world games do.

They still sell well, but even Ubi doesn't report the actual sales data of mainline AC anymore. They now do revenue.
                    >They don't sell as well as Elden Ring, BOTW, RDR2, GTA though.

You're just moving the goalposts here. The formula is successful, that's my point, and saying it's not as successful as some of the best selling open world games doesn't change that.
        >criticizing the Ubisoft formula is fair but one has to realize that 90% of people don't give a shit

So? Why is there a contingency of people on this website who think "This thing made a lot of money so you can't criticize it! You're just a stinky Redditor!" is some major own?
            >This thing made a lot of money so you can't criticize it!

I literally said, and I quote, "criticizing the Ubisoft formula is fair", in my comment.

If you can't read maybe don't go on forums?
                And yet you immediately follow that sentence uo with, to paraphrase 'lol who gives a shit'.
                    That's not a paraphrase, that's a strawman.

I said 90% of people don't care, because we were talking about how much criticism the formula gets on Reddit yet how successful it seems to be.

Once again, if you can't read then don't go on forums.
                        You're expanding on what you said, not quoting yourself. It'd be useful for you to actually know what a paraphrase in this scenario is, huh?

Oh the irony of chastising someone for not reading while flat out having to concede you did not articulate yourself well enough the first go-around.
    Also its not like Ubisoft did suddenly bring this concept up and now everyone uses it. 


This formula has been going for decades and just gets more and more expended. 


Even in games like Gothic 1 and 2 you can find plenty of game play elements that are associated with today's "generic Ubisoft Title".


Basically all open world games have always lived and worked with the same patterns for like 25 years now.
    A lot of reddit commenters are insecure children who don't feel like they should like what's popular. Everything has to be counter to the culture in order to feel special and unique.
    The "Ubisoft formula" is basically the open world game design lol. Literally every open world game follow that formula with more or less variation on it (yes even Elden Ring or Breath of the Wild do)
        Nah that's GTA3 or even Mario 64 design.

Many open world games don't have any Ubisoft design philosophy in them.

Ubisoft design is specifically the defeat the copy/paste base > climb the tower gameplay loop they made in AC and Far Cry. That's what people mean.

BOTW and Elden Ring of course both do this. But plenty do not.
That would have been great if they went the persona route. It would have made more sense imo
Automat Kalashnikova! 🪄
    In Soviet Russia Dark Arts use you.
If you didnt have to use the AK, today was a good day.
I did think a lot of what could a Harry Potter CRPG in the vein of BG3 be when playing it (the posh accent of the MC and him mentioning a Bag of Holding so many times did contribute to it lol). It could certainly be interesting and probably not that limiting for the general audience when you see how big BG3 is (it does need that AAA presentation but easy to justify for the HP license).

But on an action adventure game, I think bypassing combat or severely limiting it would be hard. They certainly could have reduced the copy paste content just increasing the duration for more combat though.
It's more refined and generally better, but I don't see how it's unique outside of the duels (which is admittedly cool)
rock paper scissors match stance to enemy type and hit the same few buttons is excellent combat? lol. a lot of style with hardly any depth. also the stealth is far worse than assassin's creed games.
now thats just dumb af
    "it was made for the fans" tells me there's nothing going on in it aside from the parts where you recognize a thing and start clapping like a seal.
It honest never made much sense as to why they even picked the 5th year. Your first classes are you learning.... first year spells.
    And you only use transfiguration and potions in the RoR
Yeah the itemization was really dull, it was neat that it changed your appearance but the stats themself felt so uninteresting and boring. I would sometimes be wearing something I had found 10 new armor sets ago because nothing new was a big enough difference to consider using instead.
[removed]
    Yeah, Skyrim is the actual offender here with constant random leveled loot making the already gamey "master chest at the end of every dungeon" more underwhelming.
[removed]
    Or maybe people had more fun being silly. Crazy that you went straight to discrediting them
        This game has a lot of weird fans who don't want to hear anything that sounds like criticism.
            It's the people that don't play a lot of videogames. Not to be an elitist but most of the people that praised this game were people whose first open world game was Hogwarts Legacy, they had no frame of reference
    Why the fuck would I want to do that? The random ass gear is the best part of the game.
super annoying to change the transmog for every new item though.
    There's a mod that auto swaps for you depending on location
        ah shit, where were you 2 weeks ago? :)
            yeah that and skipping the lockpick game are must haves
That wasn't an update IIRC, just a feature no one paid attention to at the start.
> Elden Ring will probably be one of their best games to play with a randomizer

My friend and I are currently on probably our 4th [randomizer](https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/428) + [seamless co-op](https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/510) run of Elden Ring. It's a blast. Most runs eventually have some funny or outrageous scenarios with enemy/boss placement.

For those reading this that are unfamiliar with Souls games randomizers: You can adjust the degree of "randomization" in several ways with the tool. Item and enemy placement are independently controlled, there's a pool of "important locations" that important items can be restricted to (and you can control which locations are considered important), or they can be sent to any random spot. There's sliders for "how random" enemies and items are. And several other tweaks and options.

Also, you can also somewhat get around the loot randomization if you decide you really want a particular item but don't know where it is. There is an option that allows you to purchase item location hints from Kale at the Church of Elle (the vendor in the church closest to the beginning of the game). Also, the randomizer has a `spoiler_logs` folder that can either provide general hints for where an item is, or it will give an exact location, without having to spend runes on hints in-game. So, if it wasn't placed too deep into late game areas while you're still in early game, you can probably go get an item to fit your build if you want.

It's a fun way to replay the game, especially with a friend using the seamless co-op mod.
For me it really depends on the game or the type of game I guess. 

I don't mind some RNG when it comes to items. For example, I loved playing a game like Destiny 2 or a MMORPG where doing a raid, wouldn't mean you'd get the item you want. (Not talking about shitty currency to craft gear, but actual gear piece).

It makes it exciting for me to play the raid over and over again to get that good, unique piece of loot and if the game is fun, the better.

I wouldn't like if that piece of gear would be a guarantee drop or if it has random stats and I need to get the same piece of gear for 1000x times till I get the stats I want.

I'm in a really weird position when it comes to these things.
I'm not a LotR fan (liked the books, movies were fine), and I thought the first game was fun. The second game ended up being more of a slog, and I hated everything about Shelob turning into a sexy woman.
    The second one irritates me to no end because I'm quite certain that the only reason it was a slog is because WB was flagrant trying to push those orc lootboxes so the grind was padded out to absurd degrees.

Once the game fell off the radar a little bit they went back, removed the store, and reduced the grind by a whopping 30%.

How much praise would that game be getting if they had just made it fun to begin with instead of deliberately hamstringing it to push MTX?

I'd love for someone who was bored of the game to go back and re-evaluate it without all the empty calories but "hey will you go play this game you already think is incredibly boring for me?" isn't exactly a compelling sales pitch.
        I played post-lootbox and it was still grindy....but I also checked out of the story pretty quickly and just wanted to get my 100%. Whatever balance the first game had found didn't carry long into the second.
Republic Commando and KOTOR are the ones that could stand without the licence. Mass Effect essentially is just more modern KOTOR without the licence.

I'm a relatively good judge; I don't like Star Wars that much.
    KOTOR kinda ruined star wars for me; no other star wars media (outside of the books and comics) hits the heights of KOTOR 1 and 2 to me. They feel like they actually flesh out the star wars universe, and makes all the shows and movies a little bittersweet from not using some of the themes and in universe things that KOTOR established.
        I agree totally. The films feel flat compared to how richly the setting can be opened up in an RPG. Beyond the corporate meddling and the simply formulaic storytelling (present across the series tbh), the films simply don't have enough time to get into it - and are restricted by making it kid-friendly.

There's such an opportunity for a modern KoTOR, especially after the success of BG3. I just don't want EA to have anything to do with it beyond handing it off to a talented studio.
    I'm surprised to hear that Kotor lands. That feels like you have to like Star Wars to like it, to me
        KOTOR benefits from being, well, set in the Old Republic. The barrier to entry is just “liking sci-fi” and then the only concepts you really need to know about from Star Wars are lightsabers and Force powers, everything else is pretty self contained.
            I think it could be a barrier if you've literally seen 0 star wars. But even just a movie or two and you've gotten enough of an intro for KOTOR.

And I mean... It's gotta be a majority of western audiences that have seen a (single) star wars movie... right?
        Nah, honestly Star Wars benefits from being a fairly generic setting.

So it was actually rare that you needed to be a fan of the series, to like any of the games. Since most were their own thing separate from the movies.

Most of the games could've been a new IP. These games like KOTOR or Rougue Squadron just happen to have Star Wars themes/skins.
I would disagree. I think removing the franchise the games would still be fun. If Spidey had a zip line instead of web, it would still be fun to zoot around the city and I don't think I've seen any Batman media where he just hangs around on gargoyles.
    I mean if you remove the franchise you remove the whole gadgets, combat system as it is, the traversal system for both games, the story, the enemies type, the environments... (all of this come from the franchise) and you're left with the template of an open world game, exactly like with Hogwarts Legacy. 

I don't see how that's different. Games are carried by their setting all the time (it can be a franchise but also just something like Ghost of Tsushima carried by the medieval Japan setting executed very well or Horizon by the robot dinosaurs to fight)
        I mean you are removing gameplay in those examples. There is no reason why you can't keep the elements that are from the franchise.

There was a game, whose name escapes me now, developed a few years ago that was made by someone who worked on the Spider-Man 2 movie tie in game. It was basically about web slinging but with no Spider-man, they just used a grapple gadget to create the same effect. The Arkham game could easily be reskinned as a Ninja game. Tonnes of games give the players gadgets to use, so it is not uniquely Batman.
I am just playing it wrong or is that game really difficult? I've put a bunch of time into it and I still can't get passed the second level?
    If you have a second controller you can do some cheats to give yourself a bunch of money and get a bunch of upgrades in the first level. 

(link for the cheat: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDxTcptNT9Q)

But yeah the game is kinda difficult at first, unless you get a bunch of upgrades.
        Ah, okay. Thanks. I was really surprised I was making little to no progress and I felt I couldn't use other characters because they weren't leveled. Good to know I'm not mad and grinding is part of the game.
Agreed. What was even down there? Plus with a map that big I had zero desire to fly there. I’d literally fast travel to the nearest marker and then fly.
It depends if the traversal is fun or not. I honestly had a big smile on my face when they announced Spider-Man 2 would be way bigger, the game will feature a extra island, etc.. because I love to move around in that game, never used quick travel. As for GTA, I am not a big fan of the moon physiques, so the leak kinda disappointed me a little bit. Red Dead 2 works because the horse riding feels relaxing, also the realistic physiques can lead to some goofy situations. GTA is all over the place, you touch a little obstacle and the car catapults in the air... I know a lot of people love this, but I am not a big fan tbh
That’s fair but I will die on the hill that rdr2 is a top game of all time.
> which whilst interesting to play...becomes a slog when you only have short periods of time to play.

Never felt that way to me. I could've played forever.
> which whilst interesting to play...becomes a slog when you only have short periods of time to play.

Honestly RDR2 might be the slowest game, that doesn't feel like a slog at all. I could have played that game for another 200 hours if there was something to do. Very very relaxing game.

But tbh, Rockstar's approach of any of these "realism" things is always fake as fuck. You never needed to worry about eating, warm, or anything like that. They're honestly like genuine role playing mechanics, easy to ignore, but if you wish to play grizzled country cowboy, you can.
I am in the minority, I prefer the "realistic" gameplay of Red Dead if compared to the moon physiques of GTA. In the end, it all depends if the traversal is fun, if the map is filled with interesting stuff, etc.. for example, I did not liked how Rocksteady announced Arkham Knight will have 3x the size of Arkham City, they will include the batmobile as the novelty, etc.. in the end, Arkham Knight has a boring map and the excess of batmobile can be annoying, the bloated size did not helped that game imo (and Arkham Origins suffers even more on this regard). 

And I am excited to play Horizon 2 on PC... but I hope this game will be just slightly bigger than the original, the traversal in Horizon can feel like a slog sometimes, the devs have to exercise some parsimony, sometimes less is more... Tears of the Kingdom is another example, the "depths" are just so fucking boring! First time you enter the "depths", it's amazing, scary, etc.. but when you go there for the 10th time... or even worse, if you are actually trying to unlock every "light tree" to reveal the whole map, it's a goddamn slog, way worse than Red Dead 2 or any other open world game I've played tbh
I don't know how the last three or so years have led from the Ubisoft Formula meaning "climbing towers, clearing outposts, unlocking chunks of the map, collect 100 doodads, etc." and has become "anything that is an open world action RPG."
I mean yes but Spider-Man 2 isn't bloated to hell. Its like 20-30 hours to do litteraly everything, MAX.
Remember folks, it's only a "Ubisoft-style game" if you don't like it!

That's why *Ghost of Tsushima* and *Horizon: Forbidden West* get a pass.
    
Both of those games are frequently called Ubisoft games.

GoT ruined AC for me, because it's just AC without most of the Ubisoft game design garbage that infests their open world games.
        Not going to lie but I got sick of GoTs foxes fairly quick.
    Not to mention that the first Ubisoft-style game was Witcher 3 lol
        It was AC1...
It's the Reddit echo chamber vs the rest of the world, criticizing the Ubisoft formula is fair but one has to realize that 90% of people don't give a shit
    Meh. Both Elden Ring and Breath of the Wild to a certain extent steered away from the traditional Ubisoft open world formula and people love those games all the more for it.
        That has nothing to do with what I said. Ubisoft formula games consistently sell well because most gamers don't dislike the formula, even though you'd think most people do based on Reddit.

They still sell well, but even Ubi doesn't report the actual sales data of mainline AC anymore. They now do revenue.
                >They don't sell as well as Elden Ring, BOTW, RDR2, GTA though.

You're just moving the goalposts here. The formula is successful, that's my point, and saying it's not as successful as some of the best selling open world games doesn't change that.

It has a lot to do with what you said. The Ubisoft design formula isn't the biggest problem, but the phoned in lazy approach to these games does not generate the sales that the high quality open world games do.

They still sell well, but even Ubi doesn't report the actual sales data of mainline AC anymore. They now do revenue.
        >They don't sell as well as Elden Ring, BOTW, RDR2, GTA though.

You're just moving the goalposts here. The formula is successful, that's my point, and saying it's not as successful as some of the best selling open world games doesn't change that.
>This thing made a lot of money so you can't criticize it!

I literally said, and I quote, "criticizing the Ubisoft formula is fair", in my comment.

If you can't read maybe don't go on forums?
    And yet you immediately follow that sentence uo with, to paraphrase 'lol who gives a shit'.
        That's not a paraphrase, that's a strawman.

I said 90% of people don't care, because we were talking about how much criticism the formula gets on Reddit yet how successful it seems to be.

Once again, if you can't read then don't go on forums.
            You're expanding on what you said, not quoting yourself. It'd be useful for you to actually know what a paraphrase in this scenario is, huh?

Oh the irony of chastising someone for not reading while flat out having to concede you did not articulate yourself well enough the first go-around.
It's the people that don't play a lot of videogames. Not to be an elitist but most of the people that praised this game were people whose first open world game was Hogwarts Legacy, they had no frame of reference
yeah that and skipping the lockpick game are must haves
I think it could be a barrier if you've literally seen 0 star wars. But even just a movie or two and you've gotten enough of an intro for KOTOR.

And I mean... It's gotta be a majority of western audiences that have seen a (single) star wars movie... right?
