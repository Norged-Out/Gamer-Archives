[[Months later, what are peoples opinions on Hogwarts Legacy]]


I was in love the first 10 hours but it faded really fast after seeing the things the game wanted me to do around the world. The things themselves wouldnt have been so bad if there werent so many. 

Also I dont think I ever once got a piece of loot and went "wow! nice!". It was the most boring low effort loot/gear system I can remember in a long time. 

LOVED the world they helped shape though. The art is incredible. The music incredible. 

The combat was adequate if not a bit shallow. 

It sits somewhere just below a 7/10 for me


Somewhat similar. The tasks got very repetitive and boring towards the end.
    Very boring after a while. No way I could see myself completing the game
        revelio
            *sneaking*

*"Revelio"*

Otherwise you're just running around towns and the castle yelling REVELIO
                I like that because if it wasn't part of the game we'd be fuuukd, you can also shut it off if you want a better challenge. Mess with the settings. Make a new character because each has a similar yet different story , its only as boring as you make it
            Lmao
        Gave up the game half way  , every quest plays the same .
            Yeah I think I'm 2/3 through. Play a few hours every now and then.

I loved exploring Hogwarts itself, but the open world areas aside from that are pretty meh. And omg the junky loot system
                The first few hours and exploring Hogwarts is where the game shines. They brought the Hogwarts *to life*

But then all the shortcomings arrive. You can't really make friends or adventure together; you make acquaintances that provide you fetch quests. The open world is repetitive. Going to class is so sporadic it breaks the immersion the first few hours provided.

I enjoyed the voice acting, the combat was decent, but overall it just failed to deliver upon the promise the first several hours held
                    The classes! God I wish there was anything that felt like a real class and the real routine of a school.
                        Also I forget the name of that game with the balls that's basically shuffleboard with extra steps but it was so much fun!

But then you do the quests for it and it's gone. They could have made that a persistent side game with a league, and it would have been the best side game since blitzball
                            I was so surprised that they didn't let you play that after the quest was over. For a game with so much attention to detail that was quite disappointing.
                    Limiting you to 4 spells at a time both makes no sense and was very frustrating. Gimme like a wow style toolbar
                The loot system feels to be an exact copy of AC odyssey/origin (I haven't played Valhalla)
                    Yeah, I hate all the junk it fills the inventory with.
I finally finished Hogwarts, needed to get space back on my drive.

And valhalla has a different system, you find single pieces in specific places and upgrade them.
            I pushed through, but I mean, the story is serviceable I guess, I do regret buying it though, I think it was the whole "i wanna do magic" thing that made me buy it but after getting like 1 good spell setup you don't need to switch to anything else and its just repetitive quests and an OK story.
                I borrowed it from my local library, completed main side missions and killed the final boss on hardest difficulty, I think the game has fun learning curve. As a huge potter fan it was 10/10 experience for no money. If I would've purchased the game for 80€ I think would've regretted it too.
                    I think the key is, you're a huge fan of Harry Potter which is what brings the game to a 10, if you weren't a fan, what would you rate it? I'd say maybe a 6.5
                I haven't played it, so perhaps my opinion is shit, but when the game was first announced, I was worried about how the combat was gonna play out.

Since it's a AAA game, it was more than likely to go for "tried and true" mechanics, mechanics that every  other AAA game might use.             
I was dreading the game's spell battling being a "pew pew" mage fight. A shooter in all respects except reskinned to be magical. 

Imo, a (good) Harry Potter game's combat should never (or only rarely) ever be "combat" as we are used to.             
In my mind, encounters should actually be a puzzle game, reskinned to look like combat. 

In a way, something akin to Hitman. There are a dozen ways you can locate, approach, and dispatch your target(s). Hitman may technically be a stealth-shooter, but really, it's a puzzle game.

That's what I hoped(without holding my breath) this game would be.
        I need like...three more things for the room of requirement to get 100%, I just...dont wanna go back. It was a hell of a time through the story. But I find its replayability to be lacking.
            Worst was searching for the animals and pair them up. Everything else was pretty nicely done tbh
        I played for maybe 12 or so hours, mainly just exploring and messing around but still with a good amount of story. The fun just kind of fizzled out for me and I honestly keep forgetting about it until I see something on Reddit about it.
        Got about 90% completion on it but even the back half of that was me more or less forcing myself to (i work from home so was just mindlessly grinding). The main story itself was fun but once you explored the whole map everything else got pretty stale.
        Dont worry, the final boss was underwhelming and the house cup was literally the most disappointing part of the entire game. You made the right choice.
        I was very frustrated with how good every review was - even trusted sources.
            Don't trust reviews anymore.

I stopped after TOTK. Great game but damn, a lot of reviewers completely ignored all its flaws such as performance, repetitive dialogue, and the sky islands..

The sky islands was the most disappointing part. They advertised the game like we would be spending a ton of time up there. Nope. There's only one big one and that's for the tutorial. The rest exist just for stupid shrines and some armor that you've seen in the last game...cool
            Why...?
        Lol remember when everyone said it would be GOTY?

Baldurs gate 3 *knock knock*
            C'mon bro, no one was saying Hogwarts would be GOTY when it came out the same year as ToTK.
                I'm on the same page as you but it's true that the hype for Hogwarts Legacy was huge when it dropped. People were definitely gassing it up as a GoTY contender in the first week or so, now not so much lol
                Trans people were.
            Baldur's Gate 3 and Starfield. Gonna be a good fall.
                This comment did not age well
                    Yeah lmao starfield filled about two weeks for me before I got bored and sick of it. Can't blame a guy for being hopeful! At least I had Baldur's Gate.
                        hell yeah! And I bet BG3 even exceeded your already high expectations
            Nobody who has more than surface level knowledge of games considered it even a contender in a year that has Zelda, FF16, Baldurs Gate 3, Resident Evil 4, Starfield, etc. Itll be lucky if its nominated for anything other than “biggest media impact”
                Starfield lmao
                Lol Zelda runs like shit unless you emulate it 🤷‍♂️
            *opens door* hallo. Nah, zelda tears of the kingdom is already here. *door closes*
                Only thing TOTK has going for it is the Garry's mod creation tools.
                TotK was polarizing.  People who played Elden Ring felt like both of those zelda games were shadows of Elden Ring, the durability is hated by many, I know several people who hated sticking junk on their weapons so much they never got far enough in the game to get cool looking attachments.

Baldur's Gate hasn't been out long enough to judge, but the initial reaction is overwhelmingly positive.  It's got one of the highest concurrent player counts on steam of all time.  TotK is top three, but unless there are some serious issues in BG3 come late game, I don't see anything else competing for GotY.
            As long as every character in Baldur's Gate 3 is some cis person? It will never be GOTY.
    Had pretty much the same experience. Was loving it when I first started, got about 15 hours in before I just quit playing one day and never went back to it.
    The fate of every single open word game that adds checklist activities.
    It’s a beautiful game but I soon got bored and stopped playing. Kept meaning to pick it up and finish it but haven’t really got round to it yet.
    Its a little shallow but Im glad HP got an open world game
    Standard open world game syndrome. Fun to beat, boring AF to complete.
Loved the world, but the game felt unfinished. 

There just felt like there was a lot of placeholders for certain mechanics and it makes the world feel very lifeless as a result. 

Also the combat was fun, but I wish there was more of the challenge arenas or more challenging content at the end of the game.
    The little dungeon areas you could 'explore' were the worst offender for me. They looked so cool, even if they were tiny, but you go down into these neat looking caves and ruins and open 1 chest and leave. Adding monsters or puzzles or anything to these would've made the game so much better in my mind. 

I didn't mind the story or the combat, but most of the exploration content was extremely dull.
        Ya that was part of the game that gave me the notion of it being unfinished all the loot cave/dungeons seemed they like had planned on them being bigger with enemies. Plus your character always would say “this could prove being dangerous” or I better be careful something like that.
            "this could prove dangerous" and then there's nothing there. Mini shrines a la BOTW would have gone a long way.  

Either Hogwarts castle or the open world needed to be fun exploring. The fact that both were kind of boring because there was no depth really killed the game after the first introduction
            Too many repetitive lines like that too. I don't need to hear it every time I enter Hogsmeade. Also getting your own "shop" in hogsmeade went from very exciting to extremely disappointing the second you get it.
        Agreed. I tell people that it reminds me of Skyrim's dungeons in that they felt very copy + paste, but at least Skyrim's dungeons were huge and explorable.

I stopped bothering with the Treasure Vaults in HL because all you'd get would be a piece of clothing to sell, and I had far too much money halfway through the game anyway.
    I agree, not unfinished in the normal sense where there are bugs and it's unplayable. But it felt like they were done and felt like they needed to add filler.
There are 10 things to do and you get to do them 10,000 times each. 

No 5th year student should be manhandling groups of dark wizards.
    I mean Lord Voldemort was killed by a baby, maybe dark wizards just suck
        Ttteeeeeechhhiiically Lord Voldermort was killed by a really powerful witch who was protecting said baby.
            Ttteeeeeechhhiiically Lord Voldermort was killed by his own powers.
                Ttteeeeeechhhiiically Lord Voldermort wasn’t killed that night
                    Ttteeeeeechhhiiically Lord Voldemort split his soul that night, instead
                        Ttteeeeeechhhiiically Petter Pettigrew got Voldemort's soul split that night
                        Ttteeeeeechhhiiically you shouldn't say his name.
                            Ttteeeeeechhhiiically I can say Peter Pettigrew's name whenever I like
                ...through the protection given to Harry by his mother.
        >I mean Lord Voldemort was killed by a baby

You seriously misinterpreted the story
            Also if memory serves Harry and his friends did decently well against the death eaters in their fifth year.  

Yeah the baby thing was me kinda being dumb though
                Meh, OOTP showed just how un-ready harry n the DA were for the tasks/duties to come. If it wasn't for dumbldore turning up in the ministry, HP would have died in book 5.

>Yeah the baby thing was me kinda being dumb though

Oh, I know, as was I.
    At that age, I thought I was the world's best option to handle any problem. It's the YA literature allure. Youths rescuing the world from us grown-up bastards.
        Thinking you are, I get.

Mowing down hordes of dark wizards mere weeks after learning spells?  That I don't get.
    To be fair the NPCs do all say 'this isn't something a student should be doing. I couldn't ask you to do this as you might die.' You take it upon yourself well except for the assignments to learn spells but it doesn't specify dark wizards as you could use the potions and plants on wolves or spiders.

And the dark wizards don't give you much of a choice in the matter as they all attack on sight. Fig does suggest discretion as the better part of valor using disillusionment and petrificus totalus when he joins you.

The Merlin trials could have been more varied but it seems like that was more a matter of time constraints and rushing the game out for impatient consumers like with Cyberpunk 2077. The caves were meh and on my second play through I'd get gear that was 5 levels higher than what I was wearing with lower offensive stats.
        I’m not saying the NPCs should be stopping you. Or that the dark wizards shouldn’t be attacking you.

I’m saying every wizard in that magical world has already graduated and is an experienced wizard.  The dark wizards are even especially adept at combat.  They should all trounce a 5th year when they outnumber that 5th year 6 to 1.
            >I’m saying every wizard in that magical world has already graduated and is an experienced wizard.

I mean doesn't that same problem apply to the Harry Potter books?
        I agrees with all this expect for the release rush. That's not consumers, that's the investors wanting their money at the expense is the games quality. That's what happened to Cyberpunk 2077
            Except Cyberpunk 2077 had more variety in its side-quests
            Yeah the idea this is consumers pushing for rushed games is pure propaganda
                Always the same stockholders.
            Yeah this. Rushing it would be Dying Light 2. They delayed that game multiple times (having to hire new people I believe) and the consumers kept asking for it to be released, and eventually they just released it.
        I would just correct they rush for investors and profits not really for consumers. Most people don’t mind waiting for a better game
        >impatient consumers 

More like impatient bosses pushing to get things out faster so they can start making money asap. 

People were impatient with Cyberpunk mostly because it felt like it was in forever development, pushed back quite a lot, and it became "Is this actually ever coming out?". The development was terrible on that game from what we've heard with a lot of wasted time, then it was shoved out the door by the time they finally figured out how to properly work on it.
            I love people blaming the consumers for whenever a gane is rushed. No its not our fucking faults a game comes out shit, no developer is going to push a game because some people on the internet is upset it's taken so long. The literal only case I can see that happening is a crowd funded game where the consumers are literally the investors
    I thought it was wild that I’d go to class, slaughter about 20 people in the woods right outside of school, then go back to class like it’s a perfectly normal day for a teenager.
    Yeah, the final boss should’ve been fighting 1-2 adults, with everything else scaling up to this. It should have included more magic that isn’t meant to kill people.
    Second point is a pretty bad argument though. You can drag down almost every game that has any form of action or combat in it that way.

Its a narrative continuity sacrifice to help the gameplay side. Almost every game with combat does it.
    [removed]
        Bot. This is word for word what someone else said on this thread.
Yeah about the same I got bored 15 hrs in and until you mentioned it I had kind of forgot it was even a thing I even played.

Was just a bit too repetitive for me and didn't feel like finishing it
    Yup same here dropped it after 16h, gameplay got too repetitive. I‘ve played too many Ubisoft games to stay interested with this.
        To me HL commits the biggest sin that a game can, which is being BORING. I found it to be just an incredibly milquetoast, annoying, repetitive game with very little redeemable qualities. 

It was like an AC game but somehow even more lifeless. The worst part for me though is the HUD. It’s shockingly bad. There are times in that game where it feels like 50% of the screen is covered in pointless and useless pop ups and text boxes. 

Was the first game I got with my PS5 and would likely not have played it at all were it not for that. 

4/10
    This was my concern since day 1 and thus I never purchased this game. When I voiced my concerns in gaming subreddits I got heavily downvoted and was called by names. People can be pretty blind when it comes to hyped up game releases. People wanted to love this game so much that they refused to consider any of the red flags (which were all there).
        For me personally I bought it a few days after release and didn’t pre-order cause you never know how something will turn out

But all I saw was praise, every discussion and review said it was an extremely good game and everything is fun

So I bought it and although I don’t massively regret the purchase as I still had fun while playing about halfway in the story, I too realised it was getting really boring after and so I stopped there. I guess I got unlucky and didn’t see people bringing that part of things up lol
        Same. Other than a well realised world, the pre-release stuff I saw was very generic and I had no interest, but everyone seemed to ignore the signs when I brought them up.
    So far I’m 19h in and I’m actually intrigued by the plot, but I’m a huge Harry Potter fan so I’ll take everything I can get 😂
    I was im your situatiom and decided to finish it. Was absolutely not worth it
        This is the payoff I expected. I was like I just don't think I'll get anything more from this
I’ve basically heard no discourse about it a month after release. The game was fine, and that’s about it. Your mini review and rating are accurate.

I think it will be nominated for a few awards (it’s literally too big to be ignored). but I don’t see it getting a GOTY nomination, it’s been a great year for gaming thus far.
    GOTY is pretty much out of reach for Hogwarts Legacy now. Fan votes is only 5 to 10% of the TGA GOTY, and there are so many other games with 90+ Metacritic scores that will be very hard to beat. Tears of the Kingdom, Resident Evil 4, Final Fantasy XVI, Baldur's Gate 3, Street Fighter 6 as well as smaller AA games with high scores like Remnant 2. Armored Core 6 and Starfield are still coming.
    It's pretty easy to ignore honestly. I haven't thought about it since I played it for a few weeks, got bored with the samey everything, and forgot about it till this post.
    A month after release the only people I still saw talking about it to any degree was the gamingcirclejerk subreddit. Like seriously. I feel like they put more effort into advertising the game than the devs did with how much they wouldn’t shut up about it.
    There’s a reason you didn’t hear discourse after a month and it’s called TOTK lol
        You didnt hear much about TOTK after a couple of months either. BoTW stayed in the conversation for much, much longer.
            BOTW was more innovative. TOTK was the sequel to that style of Zelda game
            I've literally heard nothing about it but I don't exist in Nintendo spaces as I don't have any new Ninty consoles. BOTW was everywhere regardless of console specific spaces.
                Meme sites were absolutely filled with stuff from Zelda. The vehicle building system is crazy.
            From what I’ve seen, the discourse was “it’s great” and there wasn’t much more to say about it.
            I dunno, I still see references to TOTK in a lot of places. Sure it died down since launch, but I don’t think we’ve moved on just yet.
                Nintendo shot themselves in the foot by not making it possible to share builds. I think that and only that would have kept the conversation. But truth be told from my experiences people talked about the game for no as long as they’ve talked about botw, at least my vivid memories in 2017/2018. Years later and you saw people gushing botw, but what’s their to gush about in totk? The devices really cool but they’ll mostly never have a long lasting impact on you as compared to an entirely huge new world. And no being able to share creations? Not being able to build huge enough devices without the frames tanking or materials despawning because of the switch’s low power? Forget about it. Even if most people enjoyed their time with the game what’s there to talk about
                    BOTW in itself was kind of fresh when it comes to open world games. Even if it had flaws, it tried to go in a direction many open world games gave up on. That in itself would spark more discussions even after its release. The impact it could have on future games across the industry, wether it should continue in this direction or go back to old school Zelda, etc. 

TOTK doesnt do anything new. It just takes BOTW and adds some things on top. But nothing that will change the direction of the industry or anything like that. Theres nothing really to talk about other than “check out this build”. 

It also helps that at release BOTW was the only game on Switch worth buying the thing for released in a year that wasnt half as stacked as this year. People would want to talk more about it and atleast share positive experiences because they just spent like 300-400 just to play BOTW.
                I havent seen like anything aside of like 2 vids of people building mechs the game is just overrated
                    Eh I still get a ton of TikTok’s about people’s builds.

But I think it’s just the algorithm feeding me those videos because I watch Nintendo-related content.
                        I dont own a switch and I could not get away from botw content for a year after it launched. I've seen a few of the new one but not even close to comparable.
                    And you can’t even build big enough and cool enough things without the switch tanking fps or just despawning devices if you go to far away💀
            I'm still extremely disappointed in that game. Mostly because of sky islands. It's almost like they intentionally misled us in the trailers. They made it look like we were going to a lot of big cool sky islands to explore. Nope. We only get 1 island that we can explore. The rest exist only for puzzles and shrines.

I just wanted to rush through the game after I realized there's no more cool sky islands. That was kind of the selling point of the game for me... I wanted to explore the sky, not hop around tiny islands to find easy shrines or flux constructs..
            TOTK still dominates my tiktok. Not much, but it has more stayingpower thsn HL
                That's just the algorithm
            TOTK was BOTW+ contraptions. Six years to get it.

I finished BOTW. I've abandoned TOTK. Almost everything in it is something from BOTW. Weird monster guy who is a moving trader? You saw him in BOTW. Company that allows you to build a house? Saw it in BOTW. Where's the fun in discovering things you've already seen?

The whole thing just felt unexciting. BOTW felt fresh, TOTK felt stale.
                I agree with you. Sorry you got downvoted by rabid Nintendo fanboys
                    Thanks !

I actually love zelda games usually.
            Yeah I'm glad people have started to realise how mediocre the open world Zelda formula is, they're a joke if you've played enough open world games already
                Exactly. I played BotW expecting some grand open world and was like… this is it? I paid $60 for this?
            I still hear plenty about that to be fair, but it just didn't have the same luxury of nothing coming out worth talking about just before or after it like Breath of the Wild had.
            Bet. Still seeibg constant inventions online because of the creativity of its sandbox system.
        That’s a completely different player base though
        I hate abbreviations so much.  What is TOTK?
            Legend of Zelda: Tears of The Kingdom
            Tears of the Kingdom (Zelda sequel on switch)
        Jedi survivor too
            Havent heard shit about Jedi Survivor a week after release though
                And honestly most of what I heard about Jedi Survivor during that week was the performance issues, not how good of a sequel it is.
                    Jedi survivor is ez goty so far not even close
                Maybe im just plugged into the right circles. I love that game
                    The game (gameplay, story, visuals) was fantastic. Severely let down by performance issues though which was a major shame.
                        I tried playing it at launch but the performance issues were really really bad, have they been fixed yet?
                            Not when I last played (PS5, around a month ago)
                Really? I heard quite a bit how it was an amazing sequel and after playing it I agree. 

I know there’s performance issues but I didn’t experience them on Xbox. I’ve heard it’s a lot worse on PC though.
            Jedi what?
        Tears of the kingdom and Breath of the wild are not great games. There, I said it.
            “I don’t care that you broke your arm”
        I'm completely convinced that if TOTK came out in PC and more consoles it'd have the GOTY 

Such an amazing game, the best one I've played since Elden Ring
        the reason is called from software, com’on.
        TOTK is mid though? maybe 7/10 imo the mechanics are great but it became meh afterwards.
    I think it would have been a serrious contender in most years. This year is insane though, best year in gaming in my life. 

How can one game hold your attention when every month something else amazing is coming out?
        I don't know why you got downvoted. 2023 is genuinely one of the best years in gaming ever. Hogwarts Legacy, Zelda: TOTK, Star Wars Jedi Survivor, Street Fighter 6, Baldurs Gate 3, Cyberpunk Phantom Liberty, Starfield, Spiderman 2. Man... I can't keep up with all these releases. Genuinley GOATed
            Honestly it’s probably because “the best year in gaming” is something everybody has very different opinions on. This is a very good year in gaming, no doubt. I don’t know if it cracks my top five years though.
                I'd say for as long as I've been into the 'gaming sphere' (from 2010 onwards, before that I was really young and mainly playing Nintendo games), 2010, 2011, 2013, 2017, 2018 and 2023 have been the primary standout years
                    See I got into gaming about a decade before you so seeing a list of best years without 2001, 2004 and 2007 is crazy to me.
            Probably for saying it would be a serious contender. Don't know about that. Every year the last 10 years has a few games that I would rate above it.    
It made very good use of the IP, I think. And that's a good thing. Often enough games that are based on these big IPs severely disappoint and it didn't. It was quite solid. Not outstanding though.
            It's probally more to do with people not liking the game, which I didn't know was a controversial opinion.
        Lol it’s not even a top 10 game so far this year.

Game is absolutely pointless past the first 10 hours.

It’s not much better than the next Ubisoft game.
        I could definitely see someone who’s perhaps younger stating that. 

My era is 97 onwards and there were some truly phenomenal years. It really went to shit past 2013 I think though and we’re perhaps now getting back on track.
            I've been playing video games for alot longer than the last 10 years.

I couldn't afford as many games as I wanted then. In 2012 I could maybe get a game or two, when they released. Maybe another game or two for Christmas.

Im an adult now and can budget what I want to games, so if a year is great I can buy them all at release.
    Yeah that’s because people finished it
    There was a long period of time where threads were brigaded and locked down because JK Rowling isn't perfect.  It was oddly one of the few games people couldn't talk about much.
    Has it? It’s been hogwarts and not much else. We got baldurs gate a few days ago and next up starfield. Armored core I think will serve a small audience and won’t get much press and the cyberpunk dlc, is well just dlc. Other than Zelda and baldurs gate what else has come out this year ?
        Star Wars Jedi, TOTK, Street Fighter 6, MK1, Resident Evil 4, Dead Space Remake, Diablo 4. And I could keep going, if necessary. There are so many options, 2023 has been an exceptional year.
            you forgot hi fi rush!
                Hifi Rush wouod literary deserve it. This game is so good in every thinkable way. The humor the fighting, the world, the artstyle, the characters, everything was executed almost perfectly.
                    Easily the best game released this year.
            Where’s starfield?
            I’d hold off on MK1 just because it hasn’t been released yet. Outside of that though, completely agree
            Yeah, 2023 has been my favourite year in gaming in a long ass time, since 2007 most likely. The other guy commenting clearly doesn't have much of a clue.
            Diablo 4. Aged like milk
            I was with you but Diablo 4 sucks, so now I don't know if those other games are good or not
            Okay, I will concede. When I first read this comment I looked at it through the lens of GOTY which none of those games you mentioned would get it realistically. Other than Zelda which I mentioned.
                Again, you would be incorrect. Some of these could certainly be nominated for GOTY, there’s nothing to stop them. Naturally, not all of them. GOTY is a select group of games.
                    Star Wars Jedi maybe, but what else? Just seems like a stretch imo. I’m not saying they aren’t good games, not my cup of tea but I’ll be shocked if any win let alone get nominated.
                        What games from 2023 do you see winning if not one of the AAA titles listed above?
                            None of the remakes or fighting games tbh. Those serve a much smaller crowd and aren’t anything we haven’t seen before. I don’t see hogwarts winning but prob will get nominated, baldurs gate potentially, starfield I’d imagine. Armored core potentially. But really just those. I felt like this year has been an absolute drought. I played dead space and hogwarts but the other games are just reskins etc imo.
                                And hogwarts legacy is the worse reskin of all, a pretty generic and bland ubisoft open world reskin, with somehow even worse story and characters (I didn't hate the game, fulfilled a small itch but after the first section and first "wow cool hogwarts" gets stale asf).

RE4 remake, TOTK, FF16, will be nominees, then you have massive hitters like starfield, spiderman, armor core as you said. There is very little chance hogwarts gets nominated, and if it does, it will strictly be because it's Harry Potter and hp stans are something else.

But we all know TOTK will win. It's not my choice personally, but it will win most likely
                I think Zelda is likely the winner here by a mile but I do see BG3 getting the upset win as TGA likes to do that. Also, if Starfield is at its best case scenario, I can see that sweeping the game awards too
        Star Wars, final fantasy xvi, Diablo 4, pikmin 4. Still to come Starfield, spider-man 2. 

Ton of other minor games as well.
        You’re kidding right? This year we got: 
dead space R
Resident evil 4 R
HiFi rush
Metroid prime R
Diablo 4
Final Fantasy 16
Street fighter 6 
Jedi Survivor 
Wo Long
Zelda
Pikmim 4
Renment 2
Bauldrs gate 3

And games coming up:
Armored core
Starfield 
Cyberpunk dlc
Spider-Man 2
Super Mario wonder
Alan wake 2
Payday 3
Mortal kombat 1
Lies of P

Not to mention fantastic indie games like pizza tower, battlebit, bomb rush cyberfunk 

This year has been absolutely FANTASTIC for games. I honestly can’t even put Hogwarts in my top 10 games for this year. 2023 has been and no doubt will continue to be a great year
        Diablo 4, Zelda, Baldurs Gate, Star Wars, FF16. Those are just the ones out now, and the “big ones”. Still had couple great remakes, and still have a lot to come out still. 

Starfield, Spider-Man, Armored Core, Alan Wake 2. 

2023 is one of the better years in gaming we’ve had.
        If you're willing to include remakes/remasters we got Metroid Prime, Resident Evil 4, & Dead Space. New games we got Diablo 4, Final Fantasy and Jedi Survivor. Plus we've gotten one of the best indies ever in Pizza Tower. It's been a solid year.

Plus we've got Armored Core and Spiderman coming out soon. Sucks that basically every game that I've named is a sequel tho.
        The Star Wars game, new Mario at end of year, Diablo 4, final fantasy 16, resident evil 4 remake (I think was this year?), dead space remake, street fighter 6, mortal kombat 1 (I think is due this year), Mario rpg remake at end of year, battle bit has been a big hit it seems

A lot of these games don’t interest me but I mean this has to be the best year for gaming since COVID I’d not one of the top 5-10 years of all time.

It’s a great time to be a gamer.
            I feel like every game that was meant to come in 2021-2022 got delayed due to COVID and landed all in 2023. It's insane
                Yeah there is quite a bit I didn’t mention also like Spider-Man 2 and a few others. It is a great year.
It’s a good game. not amazing, Not bad, just a good hair above average.
    3.6 roentgens eh?
    3.6 roentgens one might say
The first 10-15 hours were magical. Living in Hogwarts was awesome. Unfortunately the gearing and leveling didn't hold up for long.
Then it got boring, repetitive, and the same old open-world experience I've had a dozen times before.

The story couldn't keep me hooked, so I never finished.
    Honestly the game would’ve been better if it was encapsulated in Hogwarts. It became very repetitive and felt unfinished once you left the castle

Like the map was big simply to be big. Nothing interesting to do
    It didn't even feel like we were a part of Hogwarts. It just feels like we occasionally used Hogwarts to complete quests and that's it.
    This. The game felt like a slog to get through, and I spent a lot of time in the inventory managing everything. Every new item required reworking my look #slaywizard
I had a lot of fun, but I didn’t finish it because it became very repetitive.

I also feel like they originally planned to have quidditch, but couldn’t work all of the bugs out, so they just said it was “cancelled for the year” as part of the story lore. 

Lame. I wanted to play quidditch, dammit.
    Quidditch is not actually a good game and I stand by that. It has one meaningful objective assigned to one meaningful player per team and every single other player is filler. The entire quaffle game doesn't matter, it's just spectacle that goes on while bludgers chase harry chasing the snitch. Rowling designed the game around the protagonist being the only meaningful player, she was definitely not a game designer.
        True, it’s not a good game if you’re looking at it from that perspective. I’m only looking at it in terms of fun for me though, and since I’m the protagonist in the game…it works. 

I wouldn’t watch it in real life, if that were a thing.
            I think if there was a mechanism that the seeker was reassigned intramatch, quidditch would be immediately a good exciting game.
            >since I’m the protagonist in the game…it works.

Fair enough, I thought you wanted to get assigned to quidditch teams and be like, a chaser or a beater or seeker at random, that type of stuff. Uh, dibs on seeker!
                Ah hell no! Lol

Keeper might be a little fun, but we all know seeker is *the* fun position.

The rest suck.
        That's not true though? Catching the snitch gives you 150 points and finishes the game, it's not a win. If the opposing team could manage to score 160 points by quaffle goals and you catch the snitch but team scored no goals, you lose. Beaters have to stall, guardians defend their rings, etc. All of them are meaningful. What's special about seekers is that only a handful can do it, since it's an extremely fast and invisible ball.
There were multiple world Cup matches that lasted 10 hours, the record being an entire month.
            Honestly the way to fix it is to just put the matches on a timer. If your team catches the snitch within time, you win. If no one catches the snitch then the team that scored the most points wins.
                You nailed it. Such a stupid simple fix that gives more weight to scoring points
            I just think 150 points is too much. It should be a lot, should be a near certain game-winning move to catch the snitch. But to have to be +150 up on an opponent in order to not lose if your seeker couldn’t perform is just rawww lol
            But why would you catch the snitch knowing your team will lose as a result?
                I actually think that happens in the book at one point. Idk, been years since I read them. I don't remember the reasoning
                    It does, in the World Cup that Harry attends (Goblet of Fire). I can't remember the justification for doing it at the time.
It was really good, the best Harry Potter game ever made by a mile, but it really felt like it could've been so much more.
    Here's to hoping they do a sequel to expand on some of the less fleshed out elements/trim the fat. If they did that in ANOTHER time frame of Hogwarts' history I'd be psyched.

Like how ToTK improved so heavily on BoTW's elements
        Supposedly the sequels are gonna be at the other schools of witchcraft and wizardry
            I actually like this idea more. It gives them plenty of creative liberty to make something new and fresh in a world filled with uninspired sequels.
                On the one hand, it does sound like it could be great for creative purposes but on the other, the Hogwarts world is easily the best part of the game so moving on from that feels like a gigantic risk.
            Attending a Triwizard Tournament hosted at another school would be a really easy reason for The Student to be at a different school for a year, regardless if they are a champion or not.
            Ohh that's dope!
            Ya, paying for the image rights of the original cast would bankrupt the game😂
            Aw man that sounds so cool! If they tune up some of the major community complaints they could create an absolute masterpiece.
            Source: Trust me bro
            Nah nobody would buy that shit lmao. Try to convince a casual Harry Potter fan that they will spend the story in Durmstrang. Maybe super fans and that's about it. 

You can forget about any non Harry Potter fan
        TOTK improved literally on no BOTW elements. They added a sandbox creator and that’s it. There’s no overhaul to combat, traversal is even worse for like the first 20 hours with no paraglider, the underground is absolute dogshit, they didn’t even add a quick eat menu etc etc TOTK is the biggest disappointment to a sequel I’ve ever played haven’t touched that after 30hours and never plan on coming back
    Honestly, while Hogwards Legacy is good from a pure technic/graphics perspective. I personally would say that Prisoner of Azkaban for the PS2 beats it by a mile from a simple gameplay perspective. Especially if you consider how old it is.

If that game got a rework keeping most of it the same, it would definitely be better.

Prisoner of Azkaban got such a good story, lots of riddles, impactful spells.
        idk the Harry Potter and the Chamber Of secrets for Ps2 was super cool using your boom to fly around
            Yes that one was also really good. Though I never got far as the ghosts scared the shit out of me.

The third games capitalised on the entire thing some more, even if the flying unlocks rather late. (Post game I believe).

I actually even liked the fourth game even though most people despise it. It is certainly a different genre but if you figure out the controls it becomes quite the expansive game as there is so much shit you can do.
        I didn't expect to see a comment praising the PS2 version of PoA but I kinda agree.
    Nah, you'll never beat the PS2 version of Chamber of Secrets.
    Lego Harry Potter years 1-4 is better
    They have an AMAZING backbone to work off of if they make more. Which seems likely, but if they can keep the good, tweak the bad, do some nice additions the sequel could be a huge jump in quality
        Just sucks that we paid full price for the backbone, when the entire world’s been fleshed out already.
            Eh, personally I got my monies worth from it. Things I wish they did different or better for sure. But definitely enjoyed it
                Yeah, true. You’re right, I definitely enjoyed myself for the time I played it. I just couldn’t help myself from thinking what they could’ve done better. The best part to me personally was the exploration, since the combat became rock-paper-scissors(final boss especially). 

But then exploration felt more like standard dungeon crawling for mediocre rewards, or a set piece that was somehow more defined in the movies than a video game, like the Restricted Section or the Chamber of Secrets. Even the House rooms are lacking.
            Ehh. I think a game with 50+ hours worth of content, open-world, great gameplay, base-building features, fantastic beast collecting features is more than just a backbone
    The shallow pool, is still better than the majority of Tie-Ins... sad. :(
    Have you played the Nintendo DS Harry Potter games?

They had lots of fun minigames and creative collectable while also bringing Hogwarts to life.

The only thing Hogwarts Legacy had, was nice graphics, better mechanics and the features inside the room of requirement.

Overall, the old games had more content and a really nice way of playing through the books / movies.

Hogwarts Legacy felt so dull to me. They shouldn't have released it without quidditch. 

It was better than the Battlefield Harry Potter style we saw before it though...
        The older games had more content? Were you smoking weed while playing time?
            They had more playable content yeah.

I don't like running around for hours to collect useless information. 

It's my perception about the game though, feel free to disagree.
                I might have played the wrong HP game, but they sure as hell did not have more playable content. That is objectively not true. 

Though I can accept the perception part. As a kid, everything seems much bigger than it is. You could 100% these games in 8-15h.
                    Probably. I still have it sitting on my desk as I recently played through Pokemon Platinum.

Now I'm tempted to race through all of them and compare it to my playtime of Hogwarts Legacy which is accurate as I quit the game after the last quest and never thouched it since.
100%'d it.

My opinion? It's basically a Ubsoft clone. Uninspired quests, and the puzzles were all copy/paste. The world outside of the castle felt incomplete, and the tired X, Y, or Z puzzle littered everywhere did the opposite of helping. I wasn't a fan of the "chosen one," trope either, I'm a Morrowind fan, I want to start off as a shitstain, not some demigod with access to special magic. I'll work my way into legends, not have that shit fall into my lap. Don't even get my fucking STARTED ON THE LAME BULLSHIT EXCUSE TO NOT DO QUIDDICH WHEN THE MECHANICS WERE RIGHT THERE!!!! 🤬

That being said, the castle itself is wonderful to walk around, and the characters are *alright.* As a DMC fan, the combat fucking slapped though, and that was the most fun I've had with this game. It felt like a beautiful merge between the Witcher 3 and DMC, where you had to learn the weaknesses of monsters, but when fighting humans you just went nuts with the combos.

I give it a 7/10. If you grew up with Harry Potter though, I highly suggest picking it up. It was magic the first playthrough, but it really is a one and done kind of game.
    As another hardcore fellow morrowind fan I agree. What I'd give to go back to the era of games that had that level of depth.
        The new level of depth is how deep into a battlepass can you go... I hate it.
    I moved on from this game pretty early, but I tend to do that with open world games, especially ones that get repetitive (which seems to be most in my experience).

My wife, an avid HP fan, loved it though. She enjoys video games but doesn’t play them all that much but this one she fully completed. She particularly loved the raising animals part.
    I know it's a game, but a newbie walking into year 5 and sleeping through wizard training has got to be the biggest insult to wizard education since Wizards of Waverly Place.
    Perfectly put.

It's quite a fun game overall, but not particularly replayable.
Way to much filler content.
It felt like they took a very very rich fictional world and brought it to life. Like Hogwarts alone felt like there should be a never ending source of adventure and finding new things and old forgotten dangers.  It was so great to just experience everything in that area.  

And then they filled it with meh gameplay and meh (main) story. It started to feel like dragon age inquisition with so much Fed-Exery and filler. I got so bored with it and it just didn’t have any staying power to keep me interested. It was like building an amazing middle earth for a LOTR and doing its damndest to make you not want to play.
    Notice how the animation for the main character "investigating ancient magic" is the same one used in Dragon Age? Even makes the same damn sound....first time that happened in game I knew it wasnt going to be as good of a game as i had hoped. When your protagonists super special extra unique gift is jacked straight out of a different game franchise, you done goofed.
    Not got Hogwarts yet, but I loved Dragon age inquisition although my biggest complaint was how dull it got when you were doing 17 side quests in to gain XP for the main ones. 

Would you recommend Hogwarts Legacy still?
        If its on sale absolutely. Its not a bad game as much as its just an average game. I did have fun playing it, it just didnt keep my attention like i expected it to. But i bet it was great for a lot of people who played it.
I’d rather the game be 75% hogwarts than 10% hogwarts
    I wish they went all in on the school experience and made Hogwarts a much more fleshed out place. It was an outstanding environment with wonderful details, but it was so empty.



The game had no business being open world, that was just done to chase trends and make money.

Cut the open world, and if necessary, cut hogsmeade and the forest too. Start small and nail the Hogwarts experience first and foremost. 

Then branch out in the sequels and gradually add new outdoor locations, and when everything from the books is smoothly implemented into the game, with nothing left to add, then go open world for the final entry.


Basically I wish they'd started with Arkham asylum instead of trying to be Arkham Knight on their first outing.
        Perfect comparison
    Yeah seems so weird to have basically no school in a game set at a school.
        You also only went to class maybe 8 times
            The way they handled class also sucked. You pretty much just watch a cutscene. I never felt like a student
                That was possibly my main irk. I actually really enjoyed the games and duels you do in DADA and Charms on your first day, and was excited for more. Then you're just sort of let loose, occasionally coming back to learn a new spell after a cutscene. Ah well.
I think it's pretty safe to say that if it weren't tied to the HP IP nobody would have cared about it.
    Facts. It’s the most boring game I’ve played this year
    The boycott was the best thing that happened that game. It created such a Streisand Effect that it sold way more than it ought to have.
        I've heard that a lot, but I'm not sure I believe it. This was AAA game produced by a major publisher, with one of the biggest IPs in the world. Boycott or not, everybody was going to hear about this.
    I gotta agree with you. I said from the start that the main thing I enjoyed about the game was the setting and atmosphere which - credit where it’s due - was spot on. Everything else aside from that was sadly just serviceable. The combat was quite enjoyable admittedly
I got my money's worth and in the end, that is all that really matters to me. I had a good time.
    Pretty much. Even though I haven’t finished it I still VERY much enjoyed my time with it. I think I’m just about 3 missions from the proper end of the main storyline but haven’t been bothered to go back. 

Funnily enough I bout a PS5 just to play Hogwarts early
    My roommate bought it, so i played it for free. Def would not have enjoyed it as much if i dropped $60 on it
        I paid ~£55 for the Deluxe edition and was mildly underwhelmed, the extras seemed pretty useless and the only decent bonus was a Playstation exclusive. Still enjoyed the game, but would've just got the base edition in hindsight.
Maps and envios - 10/10. I had the most fun walking through Hogwarts and even some of the other areas. They looked and felt amazing

Battle - 6/10. It was combat, felt good and fluid, but horribly repetitive. What are enemies? Oh rag dolls for my amusement? Cool

Music and sounds - 7/10. It was nice at first. It'd be nicer if my chara stfu. They fixed floo powder woman, but the Chara had ~5 walking around lines and really enjoyed them.

Side quests - 7/10. I think, in some cases, they should have done more, but there were some really standout quests that were really engaging.

Story - 4/10. Really forgettable. Felt like they could have removed half the story and it would have felt exactly the same. At the end of it, they didn't resolve anything. Just said "yeah that was weird, anyways"

Side characters - 6/10. They should have done so much more. So so so so so much more. Each felt like they had so much more to offer, but we effectively did each of them a huge favor out of nowhere and they say "oh you're best friends and now they trust you with their darkest secrets". 

Misc - 6/10. Animals, broom flying, your Hogwarts house,   potion making, plant breeding. Each of them felt like they started with life, but were half baked.




Overall, the game looked beautiful and felt great to explore, but despite having some stand out experiences (haunted house mission) everything else (for me) lost its luster over time. It's not anything I see myself playing a second time.
    > Maps and envios - 10/10. I had the most fun walking through Hogwarts and even some of the other areas. They looked and felt amazing.

Playing in 4k, I will never forget my experience of first going into the dark arts tower. The textures, classical music, lighting, and *scale* of the building blew me away. It was also one part of the very impressive Hogwarts. Those devs put a lot of care into it and it shows.
        I took advice from a few early players and turned off my mini map and quest markers so I ran through Hogwarts blind. I continued to run it blind until I could navigate the halls. It sounds silly, but I felt like a new student. I can't tell you how many times I ran into the dungeon thinking I was going to Ravenclaw tower. Definitely the one thing I'll always remember from this game :)
    I feel like your numbers dont match with your words. Seems like you didnt enjoy the story much at all yet still give it a 6/10? Ranking like IGN lol
        That's honestly a fair point. I kept going back and forth between 4 and 6. Like, the premise is interesting yeah? But at the end of the day they kept it as it was. Honestly, you're right, I should have written 4. Will edit
    > Side characters

I found none of the characters all that memorable or enough for me to care about, like I'm struggling to recall the characters names, I remember there was Professor Weasley but that's cause it's Harry Potter by a very tiny margin of familiarity.
I wish the loot were better, but otherwise I enjoyed my time with it. Not sure I'd do another playthrough, though. I did all the side quests I came across from people. I did not do all the other side content like Merlin trials and such. I feel like that would sour my opinion on it, so I understand the opinions of those who did so.

The combat was actually better than I had expected, having played pretty much every Harry Potter game going back to the original PlayStation.
The castle was done really well but the rest of was pretty bland. It felt like a game made for people that were new to gaming in general, which is fine, but overall a 6-7/10 for me. Just started to fade after the intro and it never really picked up again.
Surprisingly great combat system. The room of requirement was pretty dope too. Story was pretty good but could have been better. It didn't need to be open world, just keep it to Hogwarts, Hogsmeade, and the Forbidden forest.

For any Harry Potter fan though, this shit was gangbusters. Being able to attend Hogwarts and explore all the places you read about as a kid is a magical experience.
I think its nothing special. Essentially the usual looter adventure RPG with a HP paint. 

I found the game incredibly disappointing in how little it played into being an RPG. Character customisation is extremely shallow, there's next to no opportunity for genuine role-playing and combat is extremely cookie cutter. What's the point of having us create a character, get sorted and pick a wand if all of it is entirely fluff? I had the same issue with Cyberpunk but at least that game's combat was a lot more fun and the story was a lot more engaging.
    For comparison I went back and played Mass Effect. Now that’s a game where you can roleplay. You can be a dick who doesn’t obey any of the rules, you can be by the book, you can be both depending on your mood, you can pick who to romance, you can form friendships with any one you want on the Normandy. 

In Hogwarts Legacy you are always Newt Scamander basically… like lol let me become a sassy gay death eater at this point.
        The absolute worst feeling was being hyped up by a Mass Effect style companion system (after talking with NPCs in the common room on day 1) only to never talk with them again outside of an extremely repetitive sidequest each.

And that stuff has consequences throughout the games.  Not just shallow consequences. There's choices in ME1 that can make parts of ME3 easier or harder.  A lot of ME2 ends up determining who, if anyone, will survive the final mission, which also means who might be around in ME3.  I can't remember what the ramifications all were, but pretty sure that depending on what you do at the end of ME1, that has some notable repercussions later as well.

Shoot, now I feel like booting up Mass Effect.  But BG3 just came out.  And also F1 Manager 2023, which is a whole different type of game, but hey, I'm a major Formula 1 fan and we just hit the "summer break" part of the season.  Need more time in my day to play games...
        "Go fuck yourself"

-JKR
Pretty solid game but a lot of room for improvement. The sequel can be a rockstar.
I don’t even like Harry Potter, but the game looked so good I bought it at launch.

The first 10-15 hours are great, but after that it devolves into Ubisoft style repetitive tasks and “go collect 100+ identical collectibles with no map markers”. I fucking hate that open world design style. I also couldn’t care less about the story or the goofy as shit lore, so it didn’t keep me hooked.

I don’t regret buying it tho. Its an immensely detailed game and it was fun while it lasted.
    Your reward is a room cosmetic that does nothing and nobody else will ever see it
Way overhyped. 

The only thing it had going for it is that it’s Harry Potter and that’s all it needed cause Harry Potter fans ate that shit up despite it being one of the most empty open worlds I’ve ever played with a story that pretty much disrespects all of the books/movies with this insanely powerful character who completes the most mundane missions imaginable.
It was really good for what it was. Didn’t expect much at all and was pleasantly surprised at the freedom of movement and exploration. Wish there was more variety in enemies and things to do in open world. Overall enjoyable but probably wont ever go back to it.
Meh. 5/10
Gorgeous design and architecture, but sadly it felt dead and disconnected from itself. The quests were boring. Spells were lack-luster. "Classes" were nothing. NPCs are a mixed bag, but mostly inconsequential and feel like talking to a one-dimensional trope. Enemies, loot, spells, items, etc. are just not fleshed out enough to feel real. Reminds me of a very gorgeous game from like 2005-2010.

It wasn't horrible by any means, but I regret purchasing it, for sure. Barely got a few sessions out of it before I realized it's just gonna be the same collection quests ad nauseum.
I loved the castle, but the open world started to get old really quickly.
Got boring very quickly, never finished it and I regret buying it
The atmosphere and world were top notch, flying around on a broom was amazing. The game itself was pretty shallow gameplay wise. I liked it but it was a slog to push to the end.
I loved it when I played it and I still love it even now. It was the hogwarts game I had been waiting for since I was just a little kid.  Of course it had it's flaws and I am probably biased since I am and forever will be a HP fan. I think the game did pretty well and showed a lot of love for the franchise and its world. I had a fun time playing it and that was pretty much all I wanted.
I was hooked up for a while but later lost interest
The novelty of it wore off for me pretty quickly.  Having played Elden Ring as my last game, which I felt set a new high standard across the board, Legacy feels no more an average.
Solid game, way better than expected from that studio. Definitely room for improvement
Its one of those games that gets lots of hype during the month of its release but quickly dies out after.
It’s… fine. 6.5/10. It looks beautiful. The combat’s good, although gets a tad repetitive. The story’s… OK. It doesn’t use the world very well and missed some opportunities (such as proper light/dark alignment with the unforgivable curses). The collectibles and mini-games get repetitive, as do the stock phrases. It’s worth it if you’re a HP fan, probably not worth it if you’re not.
It’s good. Solid third person rpg with a pretty fun combat system, though it is a little repetitive. I see it as the first great step towards amazing future projects. I will watch this developer’s progress with great interest.
Mid ass terf game
    Game is mid indeed, didn’t see any terf thing in it tho
        It’s the IP of a terf
    Yours is the first comment on this, but its funny reading all of the reviews in here. Because its exactly as mid as everyone, not blinded by nostalgia, thought it was going to be.
Pretty boring overall.
I really enjoy it, I love the details and exploring the world and the castle. Story is interesting so far, but I have only got around 1/3 through the main story.

I agree that the tasks do become a bit repetitive, and it does seem a bit much that I am already a crazy powerful, dark wizard battling legend and I less than halfway through my first semester at Hogwarts. Overall it seems to be a really fun game. 

The only problem I had was i took my time exploring early game, and then Tears of the Kingdom came out. I do plan to get back to it in the fall, maybe.
I just felt like it was all fluff. Super fun for mega fans but even as someone who has read every HP book at least 5 times I wasn’t into it really. 

It felt generic and unfinished in a lot of ways. I also didn’t love how ridiculously packed the opening sequence was, Gringotts + ancient magic + dragon in the first 20 minutes felt like they were just doing pure fanservice rather than respecting the world and building it up properly. On top of that, ancient magic as a concept and a mechanic felt super generic lol.
I loved most of it.

I just hate collectables and the game had way too many Merlin's riddles.
Coulda been better but compared to the literal garbage dumpster fires we get for games nowadays it was a solid 7.5/10
For me it's 7.5/10. Overall, as most people say, it's a pretty mediocre game with some strength and weakness.

The castle was probably the highlight of the game and the developers did an amazing job with the design. Then there was the combat which was unexpectedly pretty good! It was satisfying, you had a lot of builds you could use and enemies, while not really difficult to beat, were almost always a force to be reckoned with.

The story was probably mid, not special by anything unique, no shocking plot twist etc. However Sebastian's side quest was very riveting and perhaps even better than the main story.

Characters were fine but most of them were bland (besides Sebastian, Poppy, Fig and some others). It was pretty obvious they were reading the script most of the time and the facial animations weren't that good.

And as you or someone else mentioned, the inventory system was a catastrophy in comparison with everything else. Looting with the fear that your inventory is already full was very bad. And the design of the clothes... Okay I'm not gonna talk about that. 

So overall, the game has its pros and cons and the bad sides can be outweighted by the good ones. Solid game, but doesn't belong on top of the stairs.
    Man why did I write so much lol

    They all bought it to spite the people who said they wouldn’t. Big surprise, they didn’t really want to play it so discussion stopped about 4 seconds after release.
It was a good first attempt by the studio but yes it left a lot to be desired
Was definitely cool to get a modern Harry Potter game.

But have no desire to play it again, can barely remember anything specific about it either.
Majority of the development focus went to the first half of the game. Once you’ve seen most of it and tried everything once, this game gets old pretty quickly. I have zero motivation towards the second half of the game.
There were some things patched that I didn’t know were glitches that kind of annoyed me and is really frustrating. For example, getting your broom to do some Merlin trials. It’s realistic but ‘it’s not how the puzzles were designed to be solved’, such annoying excuse. Sometimes it makes me want to quit gaming all together.
Gathering/collect quests are the crutch of lack of design and story.
The main game was an absolute blast and I loved the story, but the rest of the little tasks like the camps, merlin trials etc got kind of repetitive. I did everything there was to do in the castle, all of the camps and most of the side quests then gave up halfway through the merlin trials and getting collectables in the open world, uninstalled the game  and haven't gone back to it. I got my money's worth though and had fun
Look for the size and relative lack of rpg experience of the studio that made it, I think they did an awesome job and certainly opened the door to a lot of follow up titles in future (even those with diff studios potentially)

Yes there were negatives, character animations and dialogues that felt like uncanny valley 2015 level graphics, kiddy childish feel to the point of parody at points, but I think what it did well was amazing: the broom travel, the combat, the open world map.

That first moment where u glide above wherever u are on the broom and fly wherever u want on the other end of the map is very special
I know dev said it won't be but my opinion remains strong. This game would've been alot better if it was Bully hogwarts edition.


The first 10 hours when you just explore the castle have classes etc... are by far the best. Then you explore Scotland and it becomes a ubisoft openworld checklist game.
Another boring skinnerbox follow the icons on your map and do the same thing a million times in a row never knowing why you are even bothering.
As someone who's very used to Bethesda's works design, I really missed the interactivity of the world. Not being able to pick up items scattered around the world and talk to anyone you wanted meant that the game world was just very shallow, lonely and empty. The design of the world was excellent, but lacked any kind of depth to get lost in.

Also the quests were very repetitive and meh..
“it was the most boring low effort loot/gear system i can remember in a long time”


tell me you didn’t play Final Fantasy 16 without telling me you didn’t play Final Fantasy 16 😝
Wherever it gets “rated” it is still one of the best games that have launched this year. 

I had great fun playing it, there might have been too many quests, but today so many people complain that games are long enough for the price they pay. So the developers tend to error on too long rather than too short. 

I have only played the one house, I need to go back and play the other house specific quests.
I got the game for my wife, who's a massive Harry Potter fan but not a huge gamer. Most of my experience with the game was watching her play. I think similarly to what others are saying, the world is absolutely beautiful, but the stuff you do in it is hit or miss. 

Since she's more into the stories of games instead of the actual gameplay, she was pretty disappointed that there wasn't more critical decisions and alternate endings and things like that. Plus it's annoying that there's no quidditch and they just keep bringing up how there's no quidditch. Really annoyed my wife. She probably wouldn't be as annoyed if they didn't bring it up constantly.
Exploring was fun, Gameplay was alright. Story was meh.
I think the quests featuring the unforgivable curses were the best part of the whole game. Should have based the story around that instead of the whole being the chosen one trope

Edit: also want to add that the open world was way too empty and large, I would spend way too long going to one area for a 5 min mission to then have to go all they way back. If you make me travel far for a mission keep me in the area for longer
Really ambitious project for the studio that made it.  Given their past games they've developed they actually produced a fairly good game.  


The negatives:  


The biggest flaws with the combat were bringing in the color coded shields.  It just made things tedious and felt too rock, paper, scissors in design.  


The quests/tasks were a bit too repetitive and there was clear attempts at padding out the gameplay time by having you run back and forth more than was needed.  


The player character voice pitch sound filtration is awful and sounds really unnatural and robotic outside a very narrow default window.  


Performance wise the game has issues with optimization and polish.  There's a number of problems that a month or two of development could have drastically improved the game. Assuming they had the staff/skill set to handle cleaning things up.

The positives:  


The immersion of feeling like you were at the school was really well done.  From the layout, to the voice acting for the teeachers, and the visuals... It was a treat.  I never thought I'd find the hufflepuff common room so comfy.  It was really nice.  


The tone of the story and its writing was well done. A good young adult mix of stakes but without delving into subject matter or visuals that are too gruesome.  Fit the tone of the setting and the story very well.    


The options for outfit.  The fact you just auto-save any appearance of gear you pick up so you can on the fly glamour whatever you're equipped with into your preferred outfit was a great touch and I wish more games would do something like that.  We all know the pain of RPGs where you look like a hand-me-down clown supply store reject because you wanted good stats.    


I sincerely hope if they do another hogwarts game they get approval to do one of the schools that you don't see in the books/movies.  I.e. the African school, etc.  I really want to see what they can do with more experience, time, and hopefully a little bit higher budget with how well hogwart's legacy sold.
I read most of the books when I was a kid and I'm generally familiar with the lore. Can't say I'm a huge Potter fan though.

As much as I love open world RPGs, the game was middling at best for folks like me. I've sunk a couple dozen hours into it and I don't feel compelled to finish the game.
It was a lot of fun, but I gave up in the endgame. Never finished it, but I might one day. I'm putting in my "might finish it one day, we'll see" backlog.
Ubisoft clone with a Harry Potter skin
It was aight. It's most certainly not causing a trans genocide, like all the nut jobs said.
    If you don't roll out the red carpet and praise the very floor they walk on they call it 'genocide' and 'transphobia'. It's getting ridiculous. Downvote all you want it's the damn truth.
It was the best thing to come out of the entirety of the Harry Potter IP since Prisoner of Azkaban was released.
    Idk I like the movies….
Too expensive. It's still not on sale and I'm not spending 70 dollars on this game.
    I got it for 40. It's worth 40.
I still don’t care that it exists.
Meh
I played the trail on ps+ and hated it 

Idk the controls felt so icky and loose that i couldnt enjoy the game

Also it was a rlly short trial so i wasnt super invested
It was mid
Got bored of it and didn’t finish it. It *did* make me miss elden ring, though, and got me to start a play through that I actually finished. That was fun.
I had 100% forgotten this game existed, and I have it right under my tv (with the other games),
It was great, definitely worth the money
Aggressively mediocre
Never finished it. The grind of pointless quests, the mewling of npcs, and the bland story made me give up playing it. I may finish the story some day, but I'll never 100% that game, or even attempt it.

I will give it, graphically it's gorgeous.
I fell off about 10 hours in. By no means is it a bad game. The art direction is very good, the story is ok, and I thought the combat was actually great. But the protagonist I’m playing as felt cookie cutter and the quest line just didn’t keep my attention.
It felt very flat and boring because all the characters felt stiff in there movement and dialogue. The world doesn’t feel alive due there being nothing to do. I was hoping for red dead 2 level of quality open world and interaction.
Generic open world with boring gameplay and fantastic fan service. I played it only to roam Hogwarts and its surroundings on a broom, did that for a few hours then dropped the game. Had to mod it for better flying controls though, defaults are terrible on PC.
Galme is medicore. 5/10+1 for being Harry Potter universe. Combat was basic. Exploration basic due to that stupid revelo spell. But it's cool seeing the castle and towns.
Very mid...
I can agree with the 7/10. I share the same views on the game. I really enjoyed it though.
Game is for transphobes
    Are you educated enough to know that a phobia describes a fear not a disdain? Arachnophobia doesn’t mean you hate spiders it means you are scared of them.
Best harry potter game. Could have been a better game game. But I enjoyed
Like you, i thought it started out amazing, but quickly turned boring.
I still haven’t bought it I want it so bad!
Be careful saying that word. gcj might harass you as per usual
I got bored very early into the game after the second in-game day or so I realized the gameplay was boring. The world is cool and it felt like reliving the movies but I'm not exactly a fan of the series so for me this game is a 2/10. Also sucks that I needed Internet to install it on my ps5 still don't really understand why that was needed.
Played it for over 30ish hours finished pretty much everything

Game plays fine, but its lacking content like big time.

You have this amazing sandbox with nothing to do.

Kind Weird they re not announcing any type of expansion, hell even a seasonal pass would be fine
still a great game. put it down for a while and started back up again
I own it on my ps5, I purchased the game because I am a fan of Harry Potter. I haven't beat the game but have about 20 hours in it. I think its a good 8/10. The combat is surprisingly fun, I enjoyed finding good spell combos. My personal favorite part of the game was the open world, I thought it was beautiful and enjoyed flying around and just taking in the views. The small villages scattered around the map were alright but I found Hogwarts and Hogsmeade to both be full of life. I really enjoyed the random events like seeing a student getting chewed out by the librarian or some kids getting kicked out of a shop for stealing. I really wish the game let you interact with NPCs, nothing insane like RDR2 but just being able to greet people and have simple conversations. I have overall enjoyed the game but the gameplay loop does feel reputative at times.
I absolutely adored every minute of it. I found it to be compelling and engaging, and consistently rewarding.
    Good, it was just a one timer. Plenty of games like that
My opinion is that this thread is a bad idea.
Good Harry Potter game, overall a smooth experience, the world and characters feel like the people who made it really cared about the IP it's a part of.

I did feel like it played it kinda safe with video games mechanics. When it comes to the open world, the gear system and the UI, if you've played a big budget open world game in the past 5 years or so, you've seen it all before. 

Would easily recommend it to anyone with at least a casual interest in the Harry Potter franchise, it's mostly a competently executed video game. I do have a couple issues with it though
As someone who isn’t an HP fan I loved it. The combat and world were the best parts. I still think it’s closer to 8-8.5/10 and a GOTY nominee.
It was really fun, I got it when it first came out on ps5, pre ordered back in December. Played the evoke gsme, didn't 100% it, then started a 2nd playthrough. Haven't played since. I hopped back into it a few weeks ago, as soon as the game loaded in, I closed it. I think hogwsrts legacy is more of a play once every year type game
Extremely 7/10. It could have been great as a 15-20 hour experience, but it didn't have the enemy variety or content variety for the full-length open world experience.
I think it was fairly good. Nothing to tier. I think If the world felt a little more involved it would have been amazing. Like the school was crazy cool. But the rest was just alright
Fantastic Immersive Castle, very boring game after a few initial hours
I really enjoyed everything about it *except* for flying on a broom.

Whoever designed those controls can go sit under the whomping willow
It’s boring and repetitive. Once I left Hogwarts I immediately stopped loving it. 

Anytime there is a “reveal” mechanic or “detective” mode I know I’ll be compulsively hitting that for hours. It’s not fun. This game was a 5/10 for me.

Combat was cool, the world & especially hogwarts is great, but everything else was flat.
Hate it, uninteresting combat, repetitive uninteresting enemies, and simply not for me I'm sure its great if you like Harry Potter but otherwise not real worth it imo
Quite disappointing. Enjoyed it at the start but combat quickly became a slog with enemies having a lot of health. Very repetitive.  
World looked nice and story was interesting. Never finished it though as the combat slog just killed my enthousiasm.
the most mid game. people use mid to say something’s bad, but i’m being literal with the definition. insanely average. the highlights of the game don’t come from the gameplay, it comes from the magic of the harry potter universe.
Lol forgot it even existed
I was one of many who got banned from gamingcirclejerk for discussing hogwarts legacy when they decided that anyone who didn't immediately say they hated harry potter because the author was the devil than you were a horrible person.  


So yeah...I feel like this is a trap and I'm not discussing harry potter anymore.    In fact I've already said to much.
Absolutely mid game.

Plus, JK Rowling is a piece of shit.
    People say this while using products by people who have done the same or worse things as JK
        The difference is it's a lot easier to not buy a singular videogame than it is to participate in society without consuming at least some products produced by awful practices or people.
        Well, if I can’t 100% guarantee all of my consumption is ethical, why bother trying at all?
Got bored quick. The hogwarts castle lost its luster after a few hours and the gameplay and story couldn’t hold my attention much after that.
Haven't finished it yet, got so tired of doing the same shit over and over and over again just to get a pair of useless glasses again.
I am glad I am waiting to buy till it's on at least 50 percent sale.
Very mid game with some pretty good atmosphere and probably the best game depiction of the hogwarts castle so far
I don't play it. This "you are special so you are instant 5 year student" just ruins whole thing for me
I liked it a lot when it came out, after a few days I lost interest and never finished it
Got bored fast. Exploring Hogwarts itself was really cool. But outside of Hogwarts? Not so much
Liked it a lot, but it was a play it and forget about it kind of situation. Not much desire to play it again with how long it took to get everything unlocked. 

But, I did very much enjoy it and found the combat to be wonderful. Enjoyed the clothing aspect, the castle was amazing, liked the voice acting. I was a big fan and I don’t really care about HP. Do hope they add to it somehow. They have a beautiful canvas to build upon.
I expected something like KOTOR but it wasn't but I enjoyed a bit
It’s in the mountainous pile of games I haven’t finished but still intend to go back and play
I just completed the main storyline, played with the unforgivable curses a little bit and moved on from it.

The only thing that might bring me back is if they add quidditch to it.
I played it constantly for about a week until I simply couldn't push myself to play it anymore. Never finished it and am not planning to. It's just not very fun or rewarding. It had a lot of potential, but instead it's a hollow experience.
I enjoyed it. I can’t help but felt I was a tourist at Hogwarts the whole time. There was no incentive to stay ‘at’ Hogwarts or be punished for not being in my dorm past night. 

I haven’t played in months, but does anyone know the villains names, the professors, or your side quest companions? I don’t. Maybe this is just me but I didn’t really have a connection with any of them - even though you can explore the backstory with them which is nice
I thought it was a good game, good story. But left me.little reason to do the trophey mopup at the end of the game.
I was bored of chasing butterflies or flying through balloons etc
Fantastically well-crafted game. Extremely boring after the wonder wears off.

Imho it could have been saved by either two-player online co-op, quidditch, or an actual class/builds system. Without those things, the game is lonely, there is nothing to do in the world, and your choices don't really matter. Plus, always struck me as odd how every HP game is single-player despite the entire franchise being about friendship.
I'm with you, I'd say 6/10 for me.  They had a beautiful open world.  The combat I thought was pretty engaging, it was just so different and fun to watch as well as play.  Where the game fell off for me was making it feel so damn linear in this huge open world.  Like in order to do main story quests you HAD to do sidequests which unlocked everything important.  So by the end you basically had all the spells at your disposal.  It made it so you didn't have to really venture out and discover things unless you just wanted collectables.
If there was co-op campaign with a friend, I’d give it a 9/10.
It was a really good “Wizarding World of Harry Potter” open world RPG that lacked content, and a not so good “Hogwarts School game” that looked fantastic.

I feel like they should have picked one or the other and really leaned into it but didn’t have the courage, straddled both lanes, and made a charming, great looking, but shallow and utterly forgettable game.
People are too harsh on it because of the name. 

It wasn’t groundbreaking but it was a good, fun game.
Main quest dragged way to long, boring open world with copy paste BS i had no interest in doing beyond the first few times. Combat was good but nothing revolutionary. Really without the HP name and world it would have been a pass.
It had a strong foundation and was fun for the first half, then got completely redundant and repetitive in the second half.
amazing in the beginning, at the end it just became soooo boring
I enjoyed it a bunch and almost got 100%, but it dragged on too much. I wish they had more of a class experience, and more Hogwarts focuses. Maybe in the future.
I enjoyed it but it has no replayablity.
I just wished they put a morality/RPG element into it where your type of play style alters the game play. No matter what you say to people / spells you learn and cast didn't change much for me. 

I finished it (slogged through the latter parts) and I'd give it a solid 5,6/10.
7/10 is accurate for me. Everything is very well done- Hogwarts, broom flying, heck I even liked the wizard fights and the wand puzzles. At some point though you run out of things to explore, the fights get repetitive since it’s the same rehashed character models over and over, and some puzzles like the Merlin Trials get boring (95 of these is sooo excessive). I’m not a huge DLC guy but this seems like a game that could really benefit from one.
The game was decent. Intro was amazing as you said. It fell apart for me when it became clear the game was about Wizards and goblins and war and prophecy, not about being a hogwarts student.

Where was the tri-wizard cup? Chamber of secrets? No quidditch?? Almost all story stuff takes place outside the school in some boring cave or hideout. I wanted to play HOGWARTS, but we got 1 decent class per subject and almost 0 good minigames. 

Potion making should be way more interesting and more games like the one where you rolled giant spheres.

Overall never finished the game because the story was so hard to care about, but the atmosphere of the school was incredible.
There was no real direction / inspiration for the game besides attaching their name to a world famous icon. It was easy. Low hanging fruit if you will... ideally there would be a vision for the game which would justify its creation. It feels like they just wanted to make a Harry Potter game and made it work.. Felt dull and boring.. uninspired… solid 6.
I've never really been a Harry Potter fan but I enjoyed it for the most part.

From what little I know of the franchise which is basically the first movies and books I think they did a decent job at that. It's biggest problem is that it suffers from the typical ubisoft open world design that basically all western games follow which is so boring as none of the content is really any fun or rewarding.

If anything I'd probably just recommend to focus on the main story and the character sub stories. Everything else I'd enjoy unless you enjoy the Ubisoft style.
It felt like a big game with big ideas that somehow felt so empty. If they had taken away a few mechanics and beefed up others it would have been a much superior game. Even things like the rare times you can speak with people, I never bothered because it added absolutely nothing to the gameplay. A new mechanic would be introduced and I would be excited until I realized five minutes later that the intro was about as deep as it got.
Saving animals while using the most fucked up spells
Started strong then halfway thru got boring and ended poorly
It's the best Harry Potter universe game ever made.

The downside is....it's an average open world game.
It was ok.  The lore was great.  Unfortunately the gameplay was EXTREMELY boring and repetitive.  There's clearly a best combo and while other things can be "fun" they aren't nearly as effective.
I enjoyed it, liked the graphics, combat, immseriveness of the world… but I thought it got boring as it went along. Once the shine of hogwarts wore off and the area expanded. It felt like there was much ado about nothing in the open space besides a couple quests here or there. And hogwarts felt a bit empty, I wish you could’ve had fuller conversations with more students, more school-centric sidequests and the like. The room of requirement was cool at first but started to feel like a chore to return to frequently, as did the merlin trials, treasure holes, stuff like that. Too much to 100% as an adult, but I enjoyed the main quests and my time in Harry Potter land
I agree, it's cool at first but way too repetitive. There's like 5 enemy types that all look the same except sometimes you'll fight a bigger one or one with armor that has the same exact move set. The quests, puzzles and collectibles are boring. Inventory space is ridiculously small even after doing most of the Merlin trials.

The loot system is just bad you get purple and orange gear too easily and none of them look that good even if you try to mix and match looks. The beast system could've been a lot better implement instead of them just giving you materials for upgrades you don't need. I could go on... Personally the game was like a 7/10 for me at the start and then a 6/10 towards the second half. Decent grab at like $20-$30 when it goes on sale.
I  got really into it for the first little bit… then one day just didn’t log back in. haven’t had the urge to play since
I loved it, hope it gets a well deserved sequel. Was it everything I hoped for? No. I was expecting more rpg elements and exploration. But it was probably the best game of the year so far for me and I enjoyed it from start to finish.
Great game, main story was extremely underwhelming though and a massive disappointment towards the end if you always picked the evil choice.. That whole storyline with Sebastian was turned into an absolute joke at the end.
Only had one playthrough and stopped after the story ended, felt like there was no more fun to be had and things were getting quite repetitive in the overworld. I agree that the game leaves people wanting more.

There are a lot of moments that I enjoyed, I liked petrifying the shit out of everyone MGS style. Changed to full plant build halfway through the game which turned out to be a viable build. Being able to feel strong with other builds and without resorting to Dark Arts gets a big plus from me, granted there isn't a huge variety in skills in Hogwarts Legacy. Exploring the school itself felt awesome. The different mechanics presented in the main quest felt fresh to me. 

I also liked 2 out of 3 side characters/storylines. 

My recommendation is to buy it on sale if you are a HP book/movie fan/enjoyer.

Rating would be around 8/10 for me. I don't play a lot of solo adventure games so I can only compare it to Witcher 3 and Elden Ring which were both 10/10 for me.
It's really good Exploration wise, the World it's quite well designed and I think they really succeeded in bringing Hogwarts and other key places to life, alongside the little lore pages.

Everything else is a 6/10 at best. Got boring quite fast, and I feel like the only reason the story wasn't a total let down was because the characters were somewhat engaging.

The RPG aspects were quite half-assed
It was fine. It suffered from the usual open-world bloat, and I really wish they had focused more on the friends' questlines because they were all so much more interesting than the main story. I feel like Poppy's quests in particular are more what I would want from a game set in that universe.
Didn’t mind it, the first few hours were amazing but it got old fast. Got kinda repetitive.
I think you hit the nail on the head.  At first I was thrilled and loving it.  As it progressed into… ok I have to collect how many of these?? And the gear being pure numerical upgrades (literally this one is 46, oh look this one is 49 let me swap it).  I couldn’t finish it. 

The graphics, voice acting, combat, all awesome.  The cookie cutter open world style gameplay killed it for me.
It was awesome but I should have saved the castle exploration for last. I did that first and that left the open world as my last big chunk of gameplay which meant a lot of repetitive collecting.
Was fun, liked the details, still havent finished it tho
The game gave me exactly what I want. To be a student in hogwarts, pick wands, dress up, go on classes and adventures. Story is not to rave about, but the puzzles make up for it. 9/10.
I didn’t buy it just because of the controversy around it, 50% I understood why people boycott it and 50% it just didn’t seem like THAT good if a game. After like the first month of hype I heard almost everywhere that the game is underwhelming and there’s not much to do, glad I didn’t but it
Overrated game by HP fans. If you are not fans, you will think it just meh. Aside the castle, all is bland. 5/10. Buy when sale.
Disclaimer: not a potterhead. I’ve watched most of the movies and read the first 3-4 books.

One of my biggest purchase regrets. Got caught up by the high praise and tried it out. 5-6 hours in realized it would be a game I would have to hate-play to finish so I just uninstalled it immediately.
You just described a big-ass RPG game meant for at least tens of hours as getting boring after 10, then proceeded to basically describe everything other than music and world design as mediocre, and label it 7/10 in the end. Interesting rating system.
I uninstalled after 2 hours lol
Got dizzy and nauseous from constantly needing to look out and then when the screen refuses to pan I feel disorientated. After playing an all nighter (first sitting) I felt sick for about 24hrs and never picked it back up.
I think folks giving the "I played a dozen hours and got bored" kind of why studios do what they do. You can thoroughly finish a ton of 10/10 games in that time frame (Witcher 3, SpiderMan, HorizonZeroDawn, Zelda: BoTW). There is tons of content that it can take 4x that amount but you can finish the game in 10-15 hours. 

A favorite of mines is Fallout: New Vegas and that's in the same time frame if you're just finishing the game. 

The thing is doing side quests in Hogwarts doesn't do much in terms of making the power scaling in favor like Zelda, doesn't immerse you more in the world like The Witcher or allows you to make faction allegiances that change the story like Witcher and Fallout. 

But it's a solid 8/10 because it does deliver what it promises, does allow you to play it in a very much glitch free, crash free state (and yeah no game is 100% but it's VERY clean and no on argues against that). And, unlike Stray, it delivered a good amount of content without lootboxes, DLC or subsided expansions (looking at you Bungie with Destiny). 

I just think gamers set odd expectations with games not getting that true 10/10 titles are hard and a ton of them have a component of novelty, unique story telling and immersion that's hard to really capture. I'd probably say(no particular order) Elden Ring, Witcher 3, LoZ; BoTW, Last of US, Uncharted 3, Horizon Zero Dawn, Bioshock, God of War and others are very much where you get thst score for cinematics, gameplay design, immersion, uniqueness of the game, game. 

Games that are honestly great but just can't crack higher than a 9 are games like The Sims 3, Civilization, Mario Kart and Smash that have created thst enjoyable experience and ability to play it often because you can but it isn't perfect 100%. 

Hogwarts is like a budget perfect game sitting at a 7 at lowest and 8 at highest: they do what they set out to do properly and give fans of the series an opportunity to explore but also don't disengage ppl who haven't heard it at all or know nothing of the lore. 

For the record, my partner has played it and I played parts for her and felt some areas could be better but appreciated how good it was in terms of design, gameplay and making it not overly complex which enables more ppl to enjoy it.
The game just felt kind of hollow. It didn't do much to foster any sort of overall tone and I completely forgot I played the game until I read this post.
It is a game made by studio, that makes mobile games. First like 10 hours were fine but after that I dropped the game because how mobile game it feels. The funniest thing for me is shitty potion making mechanic beqause it is just like it would be on my phone while Kingdom Come Deliverance has best alchemy mechanics I've ever seen and KcD is not a fantasy and Hogwarts is... That fact alone can tell you a lot about that game. And dungeons are crap and feel like I'm playing Oblivion(i like Oblivion. Just an example)... That is not acceptable for me....
It was fine, it did it's job. Half of the complaints here make no sense, yes the tasks are repetitive but they are a small optional thing, the main quests and side quests are mostly entertaining and different from each other.

It's a game that succeeded in its objective of making you live hogwarts a little bit. Nothing incredible but it was fun.
You get fewer spells to cast than Hero does in Super Smash Bros Ultimate.

Also, buying the game supports the transphobe that wrote Harry Potter.
I can't morally justify raising JK Rowling's public profile or net worth by buying it, but the vibe I got from the gameplay I saw secondhand is it's a kind of typical third-person action game, the kind of thing that's on the PS3 in the waiting room of the pediatric dentist's office
    Trust me, you anonymously spending a measly $70 wont be effecting her public profile at all. Be more concerned with Blackrock then some author with an opinion, because you’re likely helping out Blackrock far more than you realize.
        Most people don’t know who Blackrock or Larry Fink are
            Yep and I bet it's exactly what blackrock wants
        Eh, I've picked my struggle
I'm glad I pirated it to not give that foul woman any of my money
    ugh so you are one of those people huh?.You also did not give money to the development team,who worked hard on the game and Rowling is still richer than God.Thankfully the game was huge success and your petty boycott did not work.Get rekt son.
        You sound a lot pettier than them.
Fuck the writer. fuck the cash grab game. Cracked it. Finished it . No good things to say about it
    >Fuck the writer. 

What did Moira Squier & Genese Davis do?
        You aren't going to get an answer from a virtue signaler lol.
All I know is that people got mad on Twitter and it was fun to watch people argue about a game with wizards.  I'm not even a Harry Potter fan and a part of me wanted to get it just because of the pointless drama around it.
Yeah just put me down to 30 downvotes with the others. You cannot have a discussion about the game while ignoring what a POS you know who is.
Solid game a lot of people who played it liked.  Sold a lot more copies from the publicity the backlash gave it.
I finished all main missions in 20 hours LMAOOO

THE GAME IS A JOKE 

Needed pvp and multiplayer to truly have been a masterpiece 

The side quests & characters were ironically much more interesting than the main quest and characters 

Love the graphics though and the size 

But on a scale of enjoyment 

6/10 

Gets a lot right 

But 5 reskinned enemies 
Bunch’s spiders 
Frogs 
Trolls 

Doesn’t really cut it for me 

Also the 4 spell limit needs muscle memory which isn’t a bad thing but I would have enjoyed a rotary spell selection system 

In which I still have my 4 spell slot but I can simply L1 + R3 select whatever spell I would like to use on the fly without affecting my predisposed inputs

The fashion? Exquisite 

The actual armor ranking and whatever ? Mid
World/immersion was absolutely fantastic, combat was enjoyable but got repetitive, story was good, some side quests were interesting and fun some were just mindless and boring, activities you did outside the story though got old after the first 10-15 hours for me, ended up ignoring them and just finishing the story. Overall probably a 7 or 7.5 out of 10.
Still stutters like the piece of shit Unreal Engine 4 that it is. RT broken to hell.

Basically, as all UE4 titles, the graphical system is pure garbage. Has its' moments of prettiness and then bam, stutter, popin, artifacts, and you are taken out of the story.

Was fun for the first 10 hours and then it just pounds you with glitches it's unnerving.
It's great, add in quiditch and VR n it'll be amazing
Game was a tour de force in the ludonarrative dissonance but I loved it. All the “moral quandaries” in the story pitched as climactic moments were almost stand-up comedy routines when my guy had sent hundreds of women and men to fiery deaths (while they screamed for mercy and begged for me not to use more fire magic). Before the ending I was using avada kedavra in front of all teachers with a grin on my face.

My dude killed more people in one academic year than Voldemort did his entire life.

I loved the game a lot but they could have deleted 90% of the map outside of Hogwarts and Hogsmeade and no one would have criticized the map size.
Don't know if they fixed the MAJOR performance issues but to me it will always be shitwarts legacy. 

Absolute can of microwaved dogshit performance at launch. Ran on a 3080, 7900x, 32gb RAM and still had fps drops to 7fps. Major memory leak using upwards of 28gb of RAM. All that with DLSS set to performance too.

Shitwarts legacy


LUL people don't like when you tell the truth that goes against the hive mind
Never even finished it. Got my mount and then couldn’t be bothered to continue. The lack of actual schooling and time spent in classrooms, no truancy system made hogwarts feel really static, combat was fun but pretty easy to cheese. Just kind of a meh experience all around but the graphics and music were really well done.
Woke moralists hate it, normal people see it for what it is a good game.
Forgettable. Fake ass marketing annoyed me tho.
    What was fake about the marketing?
        There was a huge fake campaign against it because it "didn't have any politica agenda" in it. It did have it.
            And what political agenda got your panties in a twist?
                Well by your answer you clearly already know and you have your pink hair and pitchfork ready. Nevermind
                    I have no idea what you're talking about actually. And I'm not much of a Harry Potter fan, but found the game fun and simple. It sounds like you're the one with a problem here.
                    Only there isn't a political agenda in it lol. Unless you consider one single trans person existing in the world is political. And that was an optional side quest
Refunded it before my 2 hour playtime was up
Played it for a while but then lost interest after about 7 hours. 
I only bought it because if the "boycott," I'm not even a Harry Potter fan tbh.
I feel about the same.  I mentioned in another thread that it felt a little long as well.  Maybe that’s just age catching up to me.  I was buckling down trying to beat it and around two weeks or so I found myself asking “Does this ever end?”

It was a good story, just long.  Loot was meh.  The room of requirement was neat but super restrictive on where stuff could be placed.  I had a hard time really fleshing out ideas I wanted to do.

Combat was good.  There was a lot more spells that I expected so I found switching things out, even with separate “load outs” sometimes made things confusing.
It was fun enough, but the open world was boring and tedious to explore. It's very good for a HP game, but quite mediocre in general.
I agree that the gear is meh. But otherwise the game is fun. I feel like they should have made the animals faster to ride so you have a reason to. They’re slower and turn like shit so I just take a broom everywhere.
I just started playing it now and it's actually pretty good. I'm enjoying it more than I thought I would, not a really a harry potter guy but I'm having fun.
Mid unfortunately
borderlands but harry potter basically.

it is good enough.
No complaints, only praise but I wanted more mundane things to do like going to class or Quidditch.
Wish it was longer , and I wish they had DLC and new game + other than that, I loved it, and still love it.
I loved it but the replayability is a little meh and the game is short.
I treated the game like a Hogwarts discovery tour. I covered every inch of that castle and collected every bit of lore I could find. 

The gameplay and story elements outside of that though felt very basic. I enjoyed it for a little bit but quickly grew bored. I didn't feel much incentive to explore or do tasks beyond the castle.
I dropped it and there’s not enough there to make me go running back but I definitely want to pick it up again at some point. It was fun and I like the world
As a very casual fan of Harry Potter I really did enjoy the experience of exploring the map and castle.  They delivered on all the promises which is rare and I think it's a solid 8-9/10 game.  Lack of replay value hurts the score.
i tried playing it but got bored but i think its great if your a harry potter fan
It was a great game, I’m not even a Harry Potter fan and I enjoyed it. I have to say I don’t really come back to it like other games. It pretty much empties the clip the first play thru. I think it’s a good game and a great baseline for future iterations.
Great world, good combat, story mission generally fun, great animation and voice work for the most part. 

But I quit half-way through because of all the horrible open world RPG stuff. Loot items with zero value, do the same few things over and over and over and over, like the merlin trials. And enemies scale with you, making nearly all progression pointless. Too many spells that do little, and only really shine in fights with stronger enemies. 

I wish they made it more focused, skip all the open world shit and the grind, make dark wizards and actual threat (a few fights, not thousands, and you struggle even with handling one of them), and progression that make you more powerful and makes the game more complex.

But they did nail the tone and world, I think.
The game play and story are unfortunately lack luster. The combat was okay but nothing else felt worth doing. And the main story was very bad and none of the side stories really grabbed me either.

Graphicaly awsome - it brought the world of the books to life in a really amazing way.

If your not a harry potter fan boy, don't bother. I give it a 3/5
Amazing game. I wish they’d add more, hoping for DLC. Doesn’t look promising. The villain was absolutely awful, hated that.
Maybe im the only one but I honestly wish the game was a Hogwarts simulator. I know in the game you went to class but i wanted class minigames, actual homework. Like the grand plot was just wasted on me and im not a huge Harry Potter fan.
I thought the game was fun for what it was. I only got into really watching the films the year prior and I really enjoyed playing the game and being able to point out familiar locations. The visual was stunning, the music was great(my copy of the vinyl release arrived a few weeks ago), and I was hooked for the few weeks I was playing it until I finished. That being said, the clothing system was meh. I didn't even care about the skills most of the time, I was more interested in what outfit looked better. And it seems the game was set up for people to play multiple playthroughs, I haven't had any drive to replay. 

Compared to the other games, I played and finished this year, this game was hardly the worst. I wanted a game that made me feel a part of the Harry Potter world I think overall they did a good job at that. I would still give this a 8/10
Really enjoyable game but it’s a coin toss whether it will work on your pc or not. Got it on launch, worked for a while until a patch triggered the shader bug… then it went through bouts of loading / not loading

Now I can’t even get to the load menu which is a shame because I’d really like to finish it
Overhyped.

Once you seen the first 10 hours or something ,you seen everything.
It was fine. Lovely world, weirdly disconnected main story. Very little to actually interact with and do at the school. And the dissonance between being a pupil and absolutely murdering fools with Avada Kadavra just felt poor too.

I'm hoping they can focus on making a more coherent game/world with more interesting side quests and things to do. This was a great base for a sequel
elden ring kinda ruined it for me.


I named it Revelio Simulator
I regretted buying it immediately.  Played a few hours. Tried it again yesterday and just had no desire to once I started
I consider it as a Hogwarts world simulator.

It is a great game to get into this world and fly around, fight some enemies, do some puzzles. But it is not something that would get you into playing it non stop like the witcher 3 did for me.
- quidditch would have been a game changer. Tournaments and stuff like that and practises.
- it would have been better, if players felt more like actual students, that have to regularly attend classes. I know it sounds bit strange, but that’s what I thought
magic cool, main story bad.
As a first open world game in the Harry Potter universe, it was great. Still a bit too expensive but it'll be worth 20.
Yeah, fun for the first half, outstayed its welcome.

And the dialogue was just... really bad. Slytherin dude was the only character i even remotely cared about.
My sister told me she finally beat it and loves it. (Non-gamer)
Yeah I'd say I gave it a good 12 hours or so before I got bored and shelved it for a while. But I'll go back some day, it's a good game and easily the best Harry Potter game.
Pretty good game. 

I wish I had waited for a sale though. It’s a $25-30 game, not the $60 I paid.
I really enjoyed the game. The world is amazing. Exploring the castle and the world. I always enjoyed flying around. I enjoyed the storyline. The main quests are great. Battles are fun but repetitive. The best part of the game was the music. My first play through was in Slytherin house. I loved listing to the Slytherin common room music. I’m glad the game has a soundtrack album on Spotify. Overall, I enjoyed it
Agree with the comments about the gameplay. But did have some genuine "wow" moments. At one time I was just exploring the castle, reached a garden, looking over the lake, just when the sun came up. The music changed, the color was simply magical. Made me feel ...
So much filler content and poorly written dialogue made the game unplayable for me at a certain point. Regrettable purchase in the end for me.
Very boring after a while. No way I could see myself completing the game
    revelio
        *sneaking*

*"Revelio"*

Otherwise you're just running around towns and the castle yelling REVELIO
            I like that because if it wasn't part of the game we'd be fuuukd, you can also shut it off if you want a better challenge. Mess with the settings. Make a new character because each has a similar yet different story , its only as boring as you make it
        Lmao
    Gave up the game half way  , every quest plays the same .
        Yeah I think I'm 2/3 through. Play a few hours every now and then.

I loved exploring Hogwarts itself, but the open world areas aside from that are pretty meh. And omg the junky loot system
            The first few hours and exploring Hogwarts is where the game shines. They brought the Hogwarts *to life*

But then all the shortcomings arrive. You can't really make friends or adventure together; you make acquaintances that provide you fetch quests. The open world is repetitive. Going to class is so sporadic it breaks the immersion the first few hours provided.

I enjoyed the voice acting, the combat was decent, but overall it just failed to deliver upon the promise the first several hours held
                The classes! God I wish there was anything that felt like a real class and the real routine of a school.
                    Also I forget the name of that game with the balls that's basically shuffleboard with extra steps but it was so much fun!

But then you do the quests for it and it's gone. They could have made that a persistent side game with a league, and it would have been the best side game since blitzball
                        I was so surprised that they didn't let you play that after the quest was over. For a game with so much attention to detail that was quite disappointing.
                Limiting you to 4 spells at a time both makes no sense and was very frustrating. Gimme like a wow style toolbar
            The loot system feels to be an exact copy of AC odyssey/origin (I haven't played Valhalla)
                Yeah, I hate all the junk it fills the inventory with.
I finally finished Hogwarts, needed to get space back on my drive.

And valhalla has a different system, you find single pieces in specific places and upgrade them.
        I pushed through, but I mean, the story is serviceable I guess, I do regret buying it though, I think it was the whole "i wanna do magic" thing that made me buy it but after getting like 1 good spell setup you don't need to switch to anything else and its just repetitive quests and an OK story.
            I borrowed it from my local library, completed main side missions and killed the final boss on hardest difficulty, I think the game has fun learning curve. As a huge potter fan it was 10/10 experience for no money. If I would've purchased the game for 80€ I think would've regretted it too.
                I think the key is, you're a huge fan of Harry Potter which is what brings the game to a 10, if you weren't a fan, what would you rate it? I'd say maybe a 6.5
            I haven't played it, so perhaps my opinion is shit, but when the game was first announced, I was worried about how the combat was gonna play out.

Since it's a AAA game, it was more than likely to go for "tried and true" mechanics, mechanics that every  other AAA game might use.             
I was dreading the game's spell battling being a "pew pew" mage fight. A shooter in all respects except reskinned to be magical. 

Imo, a (good) Harry Potter game's combat should never (or only rarely) ever be "combat" as we are used to.             
In my mind, encounters should actually be a puzzle game, reskinned to look like combat. 

In a way, something akin to Hitman. There are a dozen ways you can locate, approach, and dispatch your target(s). Hitman may technically be a stealth-shooter, but really, it's a puzzle game.

That's what I hoped(without holding my breath) this game would be.
    I need like...three more things for the room of requirement to get 100%, I just...dont wanna go back. It was a hell of a time through the story. But I find its replayability to be lacking.
        Worst was searching for the animals and pair them up. Everything else was pretty nicely done tbh
    I played for maybe 12 or so hours, mainly just exploring and messing around but still with a good amount of story. The fun just kind of fizzled out for me and I honestly keep forgetting about it until I see something on Reddit about it.
    Got about 90% completion on it but even the back half of that was me more or less forcing myself to (i work from home so was just mindlessly grinding). The main story itself was fun but once you explored the whole map everything else got pretty stale.
    Dont worry, the final boss was underwhelming and the house cup was literally the most disappointing part of the entire game. You made the right choice.
    I was very frustrated with how good every review was - even trusted sources.
        Don't trust reviews anymore.

I stopped after TOTK. Great game but damn, a lot of reviewers completely ignored all its flaws such as performance, repetitive dialogue, and the sky islands..

The sky islands was the most disappointing part. They advertised the game like we would be spending a ton of time up there. Nope. There's only one big one and that's for the tutorial. The rest exist just for stupid shrines and some armor that you've seen in the last game...cool
        Why...?
    Lol remember when everyone said it would be GOTY?

Baldurs gate 3 *knock knock*
        C'mon bro, no one was saying Hogwarts would be GOTY when it came out the same year as ToTK.
            I'm on the same page as you but it's true that the hype for Hogwarts Legacy was huge when it dropped. People were definitely gassing it up as a GoTY contender in the first week or so, now not so much lol
            Trans people were.
        Baldur's Gate 3 and Starfield. Gonna be a good fall.
            This comment did not age well
                Yeah lmao starfield filled about two weeks for me before I got bored and sick of it. Can't blame a guy for being hopeful! At least I had Baldur's Gate.
                    hell yeah! And I bet BG3 even exceeded your already high expectations
        Nobody who has more than surface level knowledge of games considered it even a contender in a year that has Zelda, FF16, Baldurs Gate 3, Resident Evil 4, Starfield, etc. Itll be lucky if its nominated for anything other than “biggest media impact”
            Starfield lmao
            Lol Zelda runs like shit unless you emulate it 🤷‍♂️
        *opens door* hallo. Nah, zelda tears of the kingdom is already here. *door closes*
            Only thing TOTK has going for it is the Garry's mod creation tools.
            TotK was polarizing.  People who played Elden Ring felt like both of those zelda games were shadows of Elden Ring, the durability is hated by many, I know several people who hated sticking junk on their weapons so much they never got far enough in the game to get cool looking attachments.

Baldur's Gate hasn't been out long enough to judge, but the initial reaction is overwhelmingly positive.  It's got one of the highest concurrent player counts on steam of all time.  TotK is top three, but unless there are some serious issues in BG3 come late game, I don't see anything else competing for GotY.
        As long as every character in Baldur's Gate 3 is some cis person? It will never be GOTY.
Had pretty much the same experience. Was loving it when I first started, got about 15 hours in before I just quit playing one day and never went back to it.
The fate of every single open word game that adds checklist activities.
It’s a beautiful game but I soon got bored and stopped playing. Kept meaning to pick it up and finish it but haven’t really got round to it yet.
Its a little shallow but Im glad HP got an open world game
Standard open world game syndrome. Fun to beat, boring AF to complete.
The little dungeon areas you could 'explore' were the worst offender for me. They looked so cool, even if they were tiny, but you go down into these neat looking caves and ruins and open 1 chest and leave. Adding monsters or puzzles or anything to these would've made the game so much better in my mind. 

I didn't mind the story or the combat, but most of the exploration content was extremely dull.
    Ya that was part of the game that gave me the notion of it being unfinished all the loot cave/dungeons seemed they like had planned on them being bigger with enemies. Plus your character always would say “this could prove being dangerous” or I better be careful something like that.
        "this could prove dangerous" and then there's nothing there. Mini shrines a la BOTW would have gone a long way.  

Either Hogwarts castle or the open world needed to be fun exploring. The fact that both were kind of boring because there was no depth really killed the game after the first introduction
        Too many repetitive lines like that too. I don't need to hear it every time I enter Hogsmeade. Also getting your own "shop" in hogsmeade went from very exciting to extremely disappointing the second you get it.
    Agreed. I tell people that it reminds me of Skyrim's dungeons in that they felt very copy + paste, but at least Skyrim's dungeons were huge and explorable.

I stopped bothering with the Treasure Vaults in HL because all you'd get would be a piece of clothing to sell, and I had far too much money halfway through the game anyway.
I agree, not unfinished in the normal sense where there are bugs and it's unplayable. But it felt like they were done and felt like they needed to add filler.
I mean Lord Voldemort was killed by a baby, maybe dark wizards just suck
    Ttteeeeeechhhiiically Lord Voldermort was killed by a really powerful witch who was protecting said baby.
        Ttteeeeeechhhiiically Lord Voldermort was killed by his own powers.
            Ttteeeeeechhhiiically Lord Voldermort wasn’t killed that night
                Ttteeeeeechhhiiically Lord Voldemort split his soul that night, instead
                    Ttteeeeeechhhiiically Petter Pettigrew got Voldemort's soul split that night
                    Ttteeeeeechhhiiically you shouldn't say his name.
                        Ttteeeeeechhhiiically I can say Peter Pettigrew's name whenever I like
            ...through the protection given to Harry by his mother.
    >I mean Lord Voldemort was killed by a baby

You seriously misinterpreted the story
        Also if memory serves Harry and his friends did decently well against the death eaters in their fifth year.  

Yeah the baby thing was me kinda being dumb though
            Meh, OOTP showed just how un-ready harry n the DA were for the tasks/duties to come. If it wasn't for dumbldore turning up in the ministry, HP would have died in book 5.

>Yeah the baby thing was me kinda being dumb though

Oh, I know, as was I.
At that age, I thought I was the world's best option to handle any problem. It's the YA literature allure. Youths rescuing the world from us grown-up bastards.
    Thinking you are, I get.

Mowing down hordes of dark wizards mere weeks after learning spells?  That I don't get.
To be fair the NPCs do all say 'this isn't something a student should be doing. I couldn't ask you to do this as you might die.' You take it upon yourself well except for the assignments to learn spells but it doesn't specify dark wizards as you could use the potions and plants on wolves or spiders.

And the dark wizards don't give you much of a choice in the matter as they all attack on sight. Fig does suggest discretion as the better part of valor using disillusionment and petrificus totalus when he joins you.

The Merlin trials could have been more varied but it seems like that was more a matter of time constraints and rushing the game out for impatient consumers like with Cyberpunk 2077. The caves were meh and on my second play through I'd get gear that was 5 levels higher than what I was wearing with lower offensive stats.
    I’m not saying the NPCs should be stopping you. Or that the dark wizards shouldn’t be attacking you.

I’m saying every wizard in that magical world has already graduated and is an experienced wizard.  The dark wizards are even especially adept at combat.  They should all trounce a 5th year when they outnumber that 5th year 6 to 1.
        >I’m saying every wizard in that magical world has already graduated and is an experienced wizard.

I mean doesn't that same problem apply to the Harry Potter books?
    I agrees with all this expect for the release rush. That's not consumers, that's the investors wanting their money at the expense is the games quality. That's what happened to Cyberpunk 2077
        Except Cyberpunk 2077 had more variety in its side-quests
        Yeah the idea this is consumers pushing for rushed games is pure propaganda
            Always the same stockholders.
        Yeah this. Rushing it would be Dying Light 2. They delayed that game multiple times (having to hire new people I believe) and the consumers kept asking for it to be released, and eventually they just released it.
    I would just correct they rush for investors and profits not really for consumers. Most people don’t mind waiting for a better game
    >impatient consumers 

More like impatient bosses pushing to get things out faster so they can start making money asap. 

People were impatient with Cyberpunk mostly because it felt like it was in forever development, pushed back quite a lot, and it became "Is this actually ever coming out?". The development was terrible on that game from what we've heard with a lot of wasted time, then it was shoved out the door by the time they finally figured out how to properly work on it.
        I love people blaming the consumers for whenever a gane is rushed. No its not our fucking faults a game comes out shit, no developer is going to push a game because some people on the internet is upset it's taken so long. The literal only case I can see that happening is a crowd funded game where the consumers are literally the investors
I thought it was wild that I’d go to class, slaughter about 20 people in the woods right outside of school, then go back to class like it’s a perfectly normal day for a teenager.
Yeah, the final boss should’ve been fighting 1-2 adults, with everything else scaling up to this. It should have included more magic that isn’t meant to kill people.
Second point is a pretty bad argument though. You can drag down almost every game that has any form of action or combat in it that way.

Its a narrative continuity sacrifice to help the gameplay side. Almost every game with combat does it.

    Bot. This is word for word what someone else said on this thread.
Yup same here dropped it after 16h, gameplay got too repetitive. I‘ve played too many Ubisoft games to stay interested with this.
    To me HL commits the biggest sin that a game can, which is being BORING. I found it to be just an incredibly milquetoast, annoying, repetitive game with very little redeemable qualities. 

It was like an AC game but somehow even more lifeless. The worst part for me though is the HUD. It’s shockingly bad. There are times in that game where it feels like 50% of the screen is covered in pointless and useless pop ups and text boxes. 

Was the first game I got with my PS5 and would likely not have played it at all were it not for that. 

4/10
This was my concern since day 1 and thus I never purchased this game. When I voiced my concerns in gaming subreddits I got heavily downvoted and was called by names. People can be pretty blind when it comes to hyped up game releases. People wanted to love this game so much that they refused to consider any of the red flags (which were all there).
    For me personally I bought it a few days after release and didn’t pre-order cause you never know how something will turn out

But all I saw was praise, every discussion and review said it was an extremely good game and everything is fun

So I bought it and although I don’t massively regret the purchase as I still had fun while playing about halfway in the story, I too realised it was getting really boring after and so I stopped there. I guess I got unlucky and didn’t see people bringing that part of things up lol
    Same. Other than a well realised world, the pre-release stuff I saw was very generic and I had no interest, but everyone seemed to ignore the signs when I brought them up.
So far I’m 19h in and I’m actually intrigued by the plot, but I’m a huge Harry Potter fan so I’ll take everything I can get 😂
I was im your situatiom and decided to finish it. Was absolutely not worth it
    This is the payoff I expected. I was like I just don't think I'll get anything more from this
GOTY is pretty much out of reach for Hogwarts Legacy now. Fan votes is only 5 to 10% of the TGA GOTY, and there are so many other games with 90+ Metacritic scores that will be very hard to beat. Tears of the Kingdom, Resident Evil 4, Final Fantasy XVI, Baldur's Gate 3, Street Fighter 6 as well as smaller AA games with high scores like Remnant 2. Armored Core 6 and Starfield are still coming.
It's pretty easy to ignore honestly. I haven't thought about it since I played it for a few weeks, got bored with the samey everything, and forgot about it till this post.
A month after release the only people I still saw talking about it to any degree was the gamingcirclejerk subreddit. Like seriously. I feel like they put more effort into advertising the game than the devs did with how much they wouldn’t shut up about it.
There’s a reason you didn’t hear discourse after a month and it’s called TOTK lol
    You didnt hear much about TOTK after a couple of months either. BoTW stayed in the conversation for much, much longer.
        BOTW was more innovative. TOTK was the sequel to that style of Zelda game
        I've literally heard nothing about it but I don't exist in Nintendo spaces as I don't have any new Ninty consoles. BOTW was everywhere regardless of console specific spaces.
            Meme sites were absolutely filled with stuff from Zelda. The vehicle building system is crazy.
        From what I’ve seen, the discourse was “it’s great” and there wasn’t much more to say about it.
        I dunno, I still see references to TOTK in a lot of places. Sure it died down since launch, but I don’t think we’ve moved on just yet.
            Nintendo shot themselves in the foot by not making it possible to share builds. I think that and only that would have kept the conversation. But truth be told from my experiences people talked about the game for no as long as they’ve talked about botw, at least my vivid memories in 2017/2018. Years later and you saw people gushing botw, but what’s their to gush about in totk? The devices really cool but they’ll mostly never have a long lasting impact on you as compared to an entirely huge new world. And no being able to share creations? Not being able to build huge enough devices without the frames tanking or materials despawning because of the switch’s low power? Forget about it. Even if most people enjoyed their time with the game what’s there to talk about
                BOTW in itself was kind of fresh when it comes to open world games. Even if it had flaws, it tried to go in a direction many open world games gave up on. That in itself would spark more discussions even after its release. The impact it could have on future games across the industry, wether it should continue in this direction or go back to old school Zelda, etc. 

TOTK doesnt do anything new. It just takes BOTW and adds some things on top. But nothing that will change the direction of the industry or anything like that. Theres nothing really to talk about other than “check out this build”. 

It also helps that at release BOTW was the only game on Switch worth buying the thing for released in a year that wasnt half as stacked as this year. People would want to talk more about it and atleast share positive experiences because they just spent like 300-400 just to play BOTW.
            I havent seen like anything aside of like 2 vids of people building mechs the game is just overrated
                Eh I still get a ton of TikTok’s about people’s builds.

But I think it’s just the algorithm feeding me those videos because I watch Nintendo-related content.
                    I dont own a switch and I could not get away from botw content for a year after it launched. I've seen a few of the new one but not even close to comparable.
                And you can’t even build big enough and cool enough things without the switch tanking fps or just despawning devices if you go to far away💀
        I'm still extremely disappointed in that game. Mostly because of sky islands. It's almost like they intentionally misled us in the trailers. They made it look like we were going to a lot of big cool sky islands to explore. Nope. We only get 1 island that we can explore. The rest exist only for puzzles and shrines.

I just wanted to rush through the game after I realized there's no more cool sky islands. That was kind of the selling point of the game for me... I wanted to explore the sky, not hop around tiny islands to find easy shrines or flux constructs..
        TOTK still dominates my tiktok. Not much, but it has more stayingpower thsn HL
            That's just the algorithm
        TOTK was BOTW+ contraptions. Six years to get it.

I finished BOTW. I've abandoned TOTK. Almost everything in it is something from BOTW. Weird monster guy who is a moving trader? You saw him in BOTW. Company that allows you to build a house? Saw it in BOTW. Where's the fun in discovering things you've already seen?

The whole thing just felt unexciting. BOTW felt fresh, TOTK felt stale.
            I agree with you. Sorry you got downvoted by rabid Nintendo fanboys
                Thanks !

I actually love zelda games usually.
        Yeah I'm glad people have started to realise how mediocre the open world Zelda formula is, they're a joke if you've played enough open world games already
            Exactly. I played BotW expecting some grand open world and was like… this is it? I paid $60 for this?
        I still hear plenty about that to be fair, but it just didn't have the same luxury of nothing coming out worth talking about just before or after it like Breath of the Wild had.
        Bet. Still seeibg constant inventions online because of the creativity of its sandbox system.
    That’s a completely different player base though
    I hate abbreviations so much.  What is TOTK?
        Legend of Zelda: Tears of The Kingdom
        Tears of the Kingdom (Zelda sequel on switch)
    Jedi survivor too
        Havent heard shit about Jedi Survivor a week after release though
            And honestly most of what I heard about Jedi Survivor during that week was the performance issues, not how good of a sequel it is.
                Jedi survivor is ez goty so far not even close
            Maybe im just plugged into the right circles. I love that game
                The game (gameplay, story, visuals) was fantastic. Severely let down by performance issues though which was a major shame.
                    I tried playing it at launch but the performance issues were really really bad, have they been fixed yet?
                        Not when I last played (PS5, around a month ago)
            Really? I heard quite a bit how it was an amazing sequel and after playing it I agree. 

I know there’s performance issues but I didn’t experience them on Xbox. I’ve heard it’s a lot worse on PC though.
        Jedi what?
    Tears of the kingdom and Breath of the wild are not great games. There, I said it.
        “I don’t care that you broke your arm”
    I'm completely convinced that if TOTK came out in PC and more consoles it'd have the GOTY 

Such an amazing game, the best one I've played since Elden Ring
    the reason is called from software, com’on.
    TOTK is mid though? maybe 7/10 imo the mechanics are great but it became meh afterwards.
I think it would have been a serrious contender in most years. This year is insane though, best year in gaming in my life. 

How can one game hold your attention when every month something else amazing is coming out?
    I don't know why you got downvoted. 2023 is genuinely one of the best years in gaming ever. Hogwarts Legacy, Zelda: TOTK, Star Wars Jedi Survivor, Street Fighter 6, Baldurs Gate 3, Cyberpunk Phantom Liberty, Starfield, Spiderman 2. Man... I can't keep up with all these releases. Genuinley GOATed
        Honestly it’s probably because “the best year in gaming” is something everybody has very different opinions on. This is a very good year in gaming, no doubt. I don’t know if it cracks my top five years though.
            I'd say for as long as I've been into the 'gaming sphere' (from 2010 onwards, before that I was really young and mainly playing Nintendo games), 2010, 2011, 2013, 2017, 2018 and 2023 have been the primary standout years
                See I got into gaming about a decade before you so seeing a list of best years without 2001, 2004 and 2007 is crazy to me.
        Probably for saying it would be a serious contender. Don't know about that. Every year the last 10 years has a few games that I would rate above it.    
It made very good use of the IP, I think. And that's a good thing. Often enough games that are based on these big IPs severely disappoint and it didn't. It was quite solid. Not outstanding though.
        It's probally more to do with people not liking the game, which I didn't know was a controversial opinion.
    Lol it’s not even a top 10 game so far this year.

Game is absolutely pointless past the first 10 hours.

It’s not much better than the next Ubisoft game.
    I could definitely see someone who’s perhaps younger stating that. 

My era is 97 onwards and there were some truly phenomenal years. It really went to shit past 2013 I think though and we’re perhaps now getting back on track.
        I've been playing video games for alot longer than the last 10 years.

I couldn't afford as many games as I wanted then. In 2012 I could maybe get a game or two, when they released. Maybe another game or two for Christmas.

Im an adult now and can budget what I want to games, so if a year is great I can buy them all at release.
Yeah that’s because people finished it
There was a long period of time where threads were brigaded and locked down because JK Rowling isn't perfect.  It was oddly one of the few games people couldn't talk about much.
Has it? It’s been hogwarts and not much else. We got baldurs gate a few days ago and next up starfield. Armored core I think will serve a small audience and won’t get much press and the cyberpunk dlc, is well just dlc. Other than Zelda and baldurs gate what else has come out this year ?
    Star Wars Jedi, TOTK, Street Fighter 6, MK1, Resident Evil 4, Dead Space Remake, Diablo 4. And I could keep going, if necessary. There are so many options, 2023 has been an exceptional year.
        you forgot hi fi rush!
            Hifi Rush wouod literary deserve it. This game is so good in every thinkable way. The humor the fighting, the world, the artstyle, the characters, everything was executed almost perfectly.
                Easily the best game released this year.
        Where’s starfield?
        I’d hold off on MK1 just because it hasn’t been released yet. Outside of that though, completely agree
        Yeah, 2023 has been my favourite year in gaming in a long ass time, since 2007 most likely. The other guy commenting clearly doesn't have much of a clue.
        Diablo 4. Aged like milk
        I was with you but Diablo 4 sucks, so now I don't know if those other games are good or not
        Okay, I will concede. When I first read this comment I looked at it through the lens of GOTY which none of those games you mentioned would get it realistically. Other than Zelda which I mentioned.
            Again, you would be incorrect. Some of these could certainly be nominated for GOTY, there’s nothing to stop them. Naturally, not all of them. GOTY is a select group of games.
                Star Wars Jedi maybe, but what else? Just seems like a stretch imo. I’m not saying they aren’t good games, not my cup of tea but I’ll be shocked if any win let alone get nominated.
                    What games from 2023 do you see winning if not one of the AAA titles listed above?
                        None of the remakes or fighting games tbh. Those serve a much smaller crowd and aren’t anything we haven’t seen before. I don’t see hogwarts winning but prob will get nominated, baldurs gate potentially, starfield I’d imagine. Armored core potentially. But really just those. I felt like this year has been an absolute drought. I played dead space and hogwarts but the other games are just reskins etc imo.
                            And hogwarts legacy is the worse reskin of all, a pretty generic and bland ubisoft open world reskin, with somehow even worse story and characters (I didn't hate the game, fulfilled a small itch but after the first section and first "wow cool hogwarts" gets stale asf).

RE4 remake, TOTK, FF16, will be nominees, then you have massive hitters like starfield, spiderman, armor core as you said. There is very little chance hogwarts gets nominated, and if it does, it will strictly be because it's Harry Potter and hp stans are something else.

But we all know TOTK will win. It's not my choice personally, but it will win most likely
            I think Zelda is likely the winner here by a mile but I do see BG3 getting the upset win as TGA likes to do that. Also, if Starfield is at its best case scenario, I can see that sweeping the game awards too
    Star Wars, final fantasy xvi, Diablo 4, pikmin 4. Still to come Starfield, spider-man 2. 

Ton of other minor games as well.
    You’re kidding right? This year we got: 
dead space R
Resident evil 4 R
HiFi rush
Metroid prime R
Diablo 4
Final Fantasy 16
Street fighter 6 
Jedi Survivor 
Wo Long
Zelda
Pikmim 4
Renment 2
Bauldrs gate 3

And games coming up:
Armored core
Starfield 
Cyberpunk dlc
Spider-Man 2
Super Mario wonder
Alan wake 2
Payday 3
Mortal kombat 1
Lies of P

Not to mention fantastic indie games like pizza tower, battlebit, bomb rush cyberfunk 

This year has been absolutely FANTASTIC for games. I honestly can’t even put Hogwarts in my top 10 games for this year. 2023 has been and no doubt will continue to be a great year
    Diablo 4, Zelda, Baldurs Gate, Star Wars, FF16. Those are just the ones out now, and the “big ones”. Still had couple great remakes, and still have a lot to come out still. 

Starfield, Spider-Man, Armored Core, Alan Wake 2. 

2023 is one of the better years in gaming we’ve had.
    If you're willing to include remakes/remasters we got Metroid Prime, Resident Evil 4, & Dead Space. New games we got Diablo 4, Final Fantasy and Jedi Survivor. Plus we've gotten one of the best indies ever in Pizza Tower. It's been a solid year.

Plus we've got Armored Core and Spiderman coming out soon. Sucks that basically every game that I've named is a sequel tho.
    The Star Wars game, new Mario at end of year, Diablo 4, final fantasy 16, resident evil 4 remake (I think was this year?), dead space remake, street fighter 6, mortal kombat 1 (I think is due this year), Mario rpg remake at end of year, battle bit has been a big hit it seems

A lot of these games don’t interest me but I mean this has to be the best year for gaming since COVID I’d not one of the top 5-10 years of all time.

It’s a great time to be a gamer.
        I feel like every game that was meant to come in 2021-2022 got delayed due to COVID and landed all in 2023. It's insane
            Yeah there is quite a bit I didn’t mention also like Spider-Man 2 and a few others. It is a great year.
3.6 roentgens eh?
3.6 roentgens one might say
Honestly the game would’ve been better if it was encapsulated in Hogwarts. It became very repetitive and felt unfinished once you left the castle

Like the map was big simply to be big. Nothing interesting to do
It didn't even feel like we were a part of Hogwarts. It just feels like we occasionally used Hogwarts to complete quests and that's it.
This. The game felt like a slog to get through, and I spent a lot of time in the inventory managing everything. Every new item required reworking my look #slaywizard
Quidditch is not actually a good game and I stand by that. It has one meaningful objective assigned to one meaningful player per team and every single other player is filler. The entire quaffle game doesn't matter, it's just spectacle that goes on while bludgers chase harry chasing the snitch. Rowling designed the game around the protagonist being the only meaningful player, she was definitely not a game designer.
    True, it’s not a good game if you’re looking at it from that perspective. I’m only looking at it in terms of fun for me though, and since I’m the protagonist in the game…it works. 

I wouldn’t watch it in real life, if that were a thing.
        I think if there was a mechanism that the seeker was reassigned intramatch, quidditch would be immediately a good exciting game.
        >since I’m the protagonist in the game…it works.

Fair enough, I thought you wanted to get assigned to quidditch teams and be like, a chaser or a beater or seeker at random, that type of stuff. Uh, dibs on seeker!
            Ah hell no! Lol

Keeper might be a little fun, but we all know seeker is *the* fun position.

The rest suck.
    That's not true though? Catching the snitch gives you 150 points and finishes the game, it's not a win. If the opposing team could manage to score 160 points by quaffle goals and you catch the snitch but team scored no goals, you lose. Beaters have to stall, guardians defend their rings, etc. All of them are meaningful. What's special about seekers is that only a handful can do it, since it's an extremely fast and invisible ball.
There were multiple world Cup matches that lasted 10 hours, the record being an entire month.
        Honestly the way to fix it is to just put the matches on a timer. If your team catches the snitch within time, you win. If no one catches the snitch then the team that scored the most points wins.
            You nailed it. Such a stupid simple fix that gives more weight to scoring points
        I just think 150 points is too much. It should be a lot, should be a near certain game-winning move to catch the snitch. But to have to be +150 up on an opponent in order to not lose if your seeker couldn’t perform is just rawww lol
        But why would you catch the snitch knowing your team will lose as a result?
            I actually think that happens in the book at one point. Idk, been years since I read them. I don't remember the reasoning
                It does, in the World Cup that Harry attends (Goblet of Fire). I can't remember the justification for doing it at the time.
Here's to hoping they do a sequel to expand on some of the less fleshed out elements/trim the fat. If they did that in ANOTHER time frame of Hogwarts' history I'd be psyched.

Like how ToTK improved so heavily on BoTW's elements
    Supposedly the sequels are gonna be at the other schools of witchcraft and wizardry
        I actually like this idea more. It gives them plenty of creative liberty to make something new and fresh in a world filled with uninspired sequels.
            On the one hand, it does sound like it could be great for creative purposes but on the other, the Hogwarts world is easily the best part of the game so moving on from that feels like a gigantic risk.
        Attending a Triwizard Tournament hosted at another school would be a really easy reason for The Student to be at a different school for a year, regardless if they are a champion or not.
        Ohh that's dope!
        Ya, paying for the image rights of the original cast would bankrupt the game😂
        Aw man that sounds so cool! If they tune up some of the major community complaints they could create an absolute masterpiece.
        Source: Trust me bro
        Nah nobody would buy that shit lmao. Try to convince a casual Harry Potter fan that they will spend the story in Durmstrang. Maybe super fans and that's about it. 

You can forget about any non Harry Potter fan
    TOTK improved literally on no BOTW elements. They added a sandbox creator and that’s it. There’s no overhaul to combat, traversal is even worse for like the first 20 hours with no paraglider, the underground is absolute dogshit, they didn’t even add a quick eat menu etc etc TOTK is the biggest disappointment to a sequel I’ve ever played haven’t touched that after 30hours and never plan on coming back
Honestly, while Hogwards Legacy is good from a pure technic/graphics perspective. I personally would say that Prisoner of Azkaban for the PS2 beats it by a mile from a simple gameplay perspective. Especially if you consider how old it is.

If that game got a rework keeping most of it the same, it would definitely be better.

Prisoner of Azkaban got such a good story, lots of riddles, impactful spells.
    idk the Harry Potter and the Chamber Of secrets for Ps2 was super cool using your boom to fly around
        Yes that one was also really good. Though I never got far as the ghosts scared the shit out of me.

The third games capitalised on the entire thing some more, even if the flying unlocks rather late. (Post game I believe).

I actually even liked the fourth game even though most people despise it. It is certainly a different genre but if you figure out the controls it becomes quite the expansive game as there is so much shit you can do.
    I didn't expect to see a comment praising the PS2 version of PoA but I kinda agree.
Nah, you'll never beat the PS2 version of Chamber of Secrets.
Lego Harry Potter years 1-4 is better
They have an AMAZING backbone to work off of if they make more. Which seems likely, but if they can keep the good, tweak the bad, do some nice additions the sequel could be a huge jump in quality
    Just sucks that we paid full price for the backbone, when the entire world’s been fleshed out already.
        Eh, personally I got my monies worth from it. Things I wish they did different or better for sure. But definitely enjoyed it
            Yeah, true. You’re right, I definitely enjoyed myself for the time I played it. I just couldn’t help myself from thinking what they could’ve done better. The best part to me personally was the exploration, since the combat became rock-paper-scissors(final boss especially). 

But then exploration felt more like standard dungeon crawling for mediocre rewards, or a set piece that was somehow more defined in the movies than a video game, like the Restricted Section or the Chamber of Secrets. Even the House rooms are lacking.
        Ehh. I think a game with 50+ hours worth of content, open-world, great gameplay, base-building features, fantastic beast collecting features is more than just a backbone
The shallow pool, is still better than the majority of Tie-Ins... sad. :(
Have you played the Nintendo DS Harry Potter games?

They had lots of fun minigames and creative collectable while also bringing Hogwarts to life.

The only thing Hogwarts Legacy had, was nice graphics, better mechanics and the features inside the room of requirement.

Overall, the old games had more content and a really nice way of playing through the books / movies.

Hogwarts Legacy felt so dull to me. They shouldn't have released it without quidditch. 

It was better than the Battlefield Harry Potter style we saw before it though...
    The older games had more content? Were you smoking weed while playing time?
        They had more playable content yeah.

I don't like running around for hours to collect useless information. 

It's my perception about the game though, feel free to disagree.
            I might have played the wrong HP game, but they sure as hell did not have more playable content. That is objectively not true. 

Though I can accept the perception part. As a kid, everything seems much bigger than it is. You could 100% these games in 8-15h.
                Probably. I still have it sitting on my desk as I recently played through Pokemon Platinum.

Now I'm tempted to race through all of them and compare it to my playtime of Hogwarts Legacy which is accurate as I quit the game after the last quest and never thouched it since.
As another hardcore fellow morrowind fan I agree. What I'd give to go back to the era of games that had that level of depth.
    The new level of depth is how deep into a battlepass can you go... I hate it.
I moved on from this game pretty early, but I tend to do that with open world games, especially ones that get repetitive (which seems to be most in my experience).

My wife, an avid HP fan, loved it though. She enjoys video games but doesn’t play them all that much but this one she fully completed. She particularly loved the raising animals part.
I know it's a game, but a newbie walking into year 5 and sleeping through wizard training has got to be the biggest insult to wizard education since Wizards of Waverly Place.
Perfectly put.

It's quite a fun game overall, but not particularly replayable.
Notice how the animation for the main character "investigating ancient magic" is the same one used in Dragon Age? Even makes the same damn sound....first time that happened in game I knew it wasnt going to be as good of a game as i had hoped. When your protagonists super special extra unique gift is jacked straight out of a different game franchise, you done goofed.
Not got Hogwarts yet, but I loved Dragon age inquisition although my biggest complaint was how dull it got when you were doing 17 side quests in to gain XP for the main ones. 

Would you recommend Hogwarts Legacy still?
    If its on sale absolutely. Its not a bad game as much as its just an average game. I did have fun playing it, it just didnt keep my attention like i expected it to. But i bet it was great for a lot of people who played it.
I wish they went all in on the school experience and made Hogwarts a much more fleshed out place. It was an outstanding environment with wonderful details, but it was so empty.



The game had no business being open world, that was just done to chase trends and make money.

Cut the open world, and if necessary, cut hogsmeade and the forest too. Start small and nail the Hogwarts experience first and foremost. 

Then branch out in the sequels and gradually add new outdoor locations, and when everything from the books is smoothly implemented into the game, with nothing left to add, then go open world for the final entry.


Basically I wish they'd started with Arkham asylum instead of trying to be Arkham Knight on their first outing.
    Perfect comparison
Yeah seems so weird to have basically no school in a game set at a school.
    You also only went to class maybe 8 times
        The way they handled class also sucked. You pretty much just watch a cutscene. I never felt like a student
            That was possibly my main irk. I actually really enjoyed the games and duels you do in DADA and Charms on your first day, and was excited for more. Then you're just sort of let loose, occasionally coming back to learn a new spell after a cutscene. Ah well.
Facts. It’s the most boring game I’ve played this year
The boycott was the best thing that happened that game. It created such a Streisand Effect that it sold way more than it ought to have.
    I've heard that a lot, but I'm not sure I believe it. This was AAA game produced by a major publisher, with one of the biggest IPs in the world. Boycott or not, everybody was going to hear about this.
I gotta agree with you. I said from the start that the main thing I enjoyed about the game was the setting and atmosphere which - credit where it’s due - was spot on. Everything else aside from that was sadly just serviceable. The combat was quite enjoyable admittedly
Pretty much. Even though I haven’t finished it I still VERY much enjoyed my time with it. I think I’m just about 3 missions from the proper end of the main storyline but haven’t been bothered to go back. 

Funnily enough I bout a PS5 just to play Hogwarts early
My roommate bought it, so i played it for free. Def would not have enjoyed it as much if i dropped $60 on it
    I paid ~£55 for the Deluxe edition and was mildly underwhelmed, the extras seemed pretty useless and the only decent bonus was a Playstation exclusive. Still enjoyed the game, but would've just got the base edition in hindsight.
> Maps and envios - 10/10. I had the most fun walking through Hogwarts and even some of the other areas. They looked and felt amazing.

Playing in 4k, I will never forget my experience of first going into the dark arts tower. The textures, classical music, lighting, and *scale* of the building blew me away. It was also one part of the very impressive Hogwarts. Those devs put a lot of care into it and it shows.
    I took advice from a few early players and turned off my mini map and quest markers so I ran through Hogwarts blind. I continued to run it blind until I could navigate the halls. It sounds silly, but I felt like a new student. I can't tell you how many times I ran into the dungeon thinking I was going to Ravenclaw tower. Definitely the one thing I'll always remember from this game :)
I feel like your numbers dont match with your words. Seems like you didnt enjoy the story much at all yet still give it a 6/10? Ranking like IGN lol
    That's honestly a fair point. I kept going back and forth between 4 and 6. Like, the premise is interesting yeah? But at the end of the day they kept it as it was. Honestly, you're right, I should have written 4. Will edit
> Side characters

I found none of the characters all that memorable or enough for me to care about, like I'm struggling to recall the characters names, I remember there was Professor Weasley but that's cause it's Harry Potter by a very tiny margin of familiarity.
For comparison I went back and played Mass Effect. Now that’s a game where you can roleplay. You can be a dick who doesn’t obey any of the rules, you can be by the book, you can be both depending on your mood, you can pick who to romance, you can form friendships with any one you want on the Normandy. 

In Hogwarts Legacy you are always Newt Scamander basically… like lol let me become a sassy gay death eater at this point.
    The absolute worst feeling was being hyped up by a Mass Effect style companion system (after talking with NPCs in the common room on day 1) only to never talk with them again outside of an extremely repetitive sidequest each.

And that stuff has consequences throughout the games.  Not just shallow consequences. There's choices in ME1 that can make parts of ME3 easier or harder.  A lot of ME2 ends up determining who, if anyone, will survive the final mission, which also means who might be around in ME3.  I can't remember what the ramifications all were, but pretty sure that depending on what you do at the end of ME1, that has some notable repercussions later as well.

Shoot, now I feel like booting up Mass Effect.  But BG3 just came out.  And also F1 Manager 2023, which is a whole different type of game, but hey, I'm a major Formula 1 fan and we just hit the "summer break" part of the season.  Need more time in my day to play games...
    "Go fuck yourself"

Your reward is a room cosmetic that does nothing and nobody else will ever see it
Game is mid indeed, didn’t see any terf thing in it tho
    It’s the IP of a terf
Yours is the first comment on this, but its funny reading all of the reviews in here. Because its exactly as mid as everyone, not blinded by nostalgia, thought it was going to be.
Man why did I write so much lol
They all bought it to spite the people who said they wouldn’t. Big surprise, they didn’t really want to play it so discussion stopped about 4 seconds after release.
If you don't roll out the red carpet and praise the very floor they walk on they call it 'genocide' and 'transphobia'. It's getting ridiculous. Downvote all you want it's the damn truth.
Idk I like the movies….
I got it for 40. It's worth 40.
Are you educated enough to know that a phobia describes a fear not a disdain? Arachnophobia doesn’t mean you hate spiders it means you are scared of them.
Good, it was just a one timer. Plenty of games like that
People say this while using products by people who have done the same or worse things as JK
    The difference is it's a lot easier to not buy a singular videogame than it is to participate in society without consuming at least some products produced by awful practices or people.
    Well, if I can’t 100% guarantee all of my consumption is ethical, why bother trying at all?
Trust me, you anonymously spending a measly $70 wont be effecting her public profile at all. Be more concerned with Blackrock then some author with an opinion, because you’re likely helping out Blackrock far more than you realize.
    Most people don’t know who Blackrock or Larry Fink are
        Yep and I bet it's exactly what blackrock wants
    Eh, I've picked my struggle
ugh so you are one of those people huh?.You also did not give money to the development team,who worked hard on the game and Rowling is still richer than God.Thankfully the game was huge success and your petty boycott did not work.Get rekt son.
    You sound a lot pettier than them.
>Fuck the writer. 

What did Moira Squier & Genese Davis do?
    You aren't going to get an answer from a virtue signaler lol.
What was fake about the marketing?
    There was a huge fake campaign against it because it "didn't have any politica agenda" in it. It did have it.
        And what political agenda got your panties in a twist?
            Well by your answer you clearly already know and you have your pink hair and pitchfork ready. Nevermind
                I have no idea what you're talking about actually. And I'm not much of a Harry Potter fan, but found the game fun and simple. It sounds like you're the one with a problem here.
                Only there isn't a political agenda in it lol. Unless you consider one single trans person existing in the world is political. And that was an optional side quest
revelio
    *sneaking*

*"Revelio"*

Otherwise you're just running around towns and the castle yelling REVELIO
        I like that because if it wasn't part of the game we'd be fuuukd, you can also shut it off if you want a better challenge. Mess with the settings. Make a new character because each has a similar yet different story , its only as boring as you make it
    Lmao
Gave up the game half way  , every quest plays the same .
    Yeah I think I'm 2/3 through. Play a few hours every now and then.

I loved exploring Hogwarts itself, but the open world areas aside from that are pretty meh. And omg the junky loot system
        The first few hours and exploring Hogwarts is where the game shines. They brought the Hogwarts *to life*

But then all the shortcomings arrive. You can't really make friends or adventure together; you make acquaintances that provide you fetch quests. The open world is repetitive. Going to class is so sporadic it breaks the immersion the first few hours provided.

I enjoyed the voice acting, the combat was decent, but overall it just failed to deliver upon the promise the first several hours held
            The classes! God I wish there was anything that felt like a real class and the real routine of a school.
                Also I forget the name of that game with the balls that's basically shuffleboard with extra steps but it was so much fun!

But then you do the quests for it and it's gone. They could have made that a persistent side game with a league, and it would have been the best side game since blitzball
                    I was so surprised that they didn't let you play that after the quest was over. For a game with so much attention to detail that was quite disappointing.
            Limiting you to 4 spells at a time both makes no sense and was very frustrating. Gimme like a wow style toolbar
        The loot system feels to be an exact copy of AC odyssey/origin (I haven't played Valhalla)
            Yeah, I hate all the junk it fills the inventory with.
I finally finished Hogwarts, needed to get space back on my drive.

And valhalla has a different system, you find single pieces in specific places and upgrade them.
    I pushed through, but I mean, the story is serviceable I guess, I do regret buying it though, I think it was the whole "i wanna do magic" thing that made me buy it but after getting like 1 good spell setup you don't need to switch to anything else and its just repetitive quests and an OK story.
        I borrowed it from my local library, completed main side missions and killed the final boss on hardest difficulty, I think the game has fun learning curve. As a huge potter fan it was 10/10 experience for no money. If I would've purchased the game for 80€ I think would've regretted it too.
            I think the key is, you're a huge fan of Harry Potter which is what brings the game to a 10, if you weren't a fan, what would you rate it? I'd say maybe a 6.5
        I haven't played it, so perhaps my opinion is shit, but when the game was first announced, I was worried about how the combat was gonna play out.

Since it's a AAA game, it was more than likely to go for "tried and true" mechanics, mechanics that every  other AAA game might use.             
I was dreading the game's spell battling being a "pew pew" mage fight. A shooter in all respects except reskinned to be magical. 

Imo, a (good) Harry Potter game's combat should never (or only rarely) ever be "combat" as we are used to.             
In my mind, encounters should actually be a puzzle game, reskinned to look like combat. 

In a way, something akin to Hitman. There are a dozen ways you can locate, approach, and dispatch your target(s). Hitman may technically be a stealth-shooter, but really, it's a puzzle game.

That's what I hoped(without holding my breath) this game would be.
I need like...three more things for the room of requirement to get 100%, I just...dont wanna go back. It was a hell of a time through the story. But I find its replayability to be lacking.
    Worst was searching for the animals and pair them up. Everything else was pretty nicely done tbh
I played for maybe 12 or so hours, mainly just exploring and messing around but still with a good amount of story. The fun just kind of fizzled out for me and I honestly keep forgetting about it until I see something on Reddit about it.
Got about 90% completion on it but even the back half of that was me more or less forcing myself to (i work from home so was just mindlessly grinding). The main story itself was fun but once you explored the whole map everything else got pretty stale.
Dont worry, the final boss was underwhelming and the house cup was literally the most disappointing part of the entire game. You made the right choice.
I was very frustrated with how good every review was - even trusted sources.
    Don't trust reviews anymore.

I stopped after TOTK. Great game but damn, a lot of reviewers completely ignored all its flaws such as performance, repetitive dialogue, and the sky islands..

The sky islands was the most disappointing part. They advertised the game like we would be spending a ton of time up there. Nope. There's only one big one and that's for the tutorial. The rest exist just for stupid shrines and some armor that you've seen in the last game...cool
    Why...?
Lol remember when everyone said it would be GOTY?

Baldurs gate 3 *knock knock*
    C'mon bro, no one was saying Hogwarts would be GOTY when it came out the same year as ToTK.
        I'm on the same page as you but it's true that the hype for Hogwarts Legacy was huge when it dropped. People were definitely gassing it up as a GoTY contender in the first week or so, now not so much lol
        Trans people were.
    Baldur's Gate 3 and Starfield. Gonna be a good fall.
        This comment did not age well
            Yeah lmao starfield filled about two weeks for me before I got bored and sick of it. Can't blame a guy for being hopeful! At least I had Baldur's Gate.
                hell yeah! And I bet BG3 even exceeded your already high expectations
    Nobody who has more than surface level knowledge of games considered it even a contender in a year that has Zelda, FF16, Baldurs Gate 3, Resident Evil 4, Starfield, etc. Itll be lucky if its nominated for anything other than “biggest media impact”
        Starfield lmao
        Lol Zelda runs like shit unless you emulate it 🤷‍♂️
    *opens door* hallo. Nah, zelda tears of the kingdom is already here. *door closes*
        Only thing TOTK has going for it is the Garry's mod creation tools.
        TotK was polarizing.  People who played Elden Ring felt like both of those zelda games were shadows of Elden Ring, the durability is hated by many, I know several people who hated sticking junk on their weapons so much they never got far enough in the game to get cool looking attachments.

Baldur's Gate hasn't been out long enough to judge, but the initial reaction is overwhelmingly positive.  It's got one of the highest concurrent player counts on steam of all time.  TotK is top three, but unless there are some serious issues in BG3 come late game, I don't see anything else competing for GotY.
    As long as every character in Baldur's Gate 3 is some cis person? It will never be GOTY.
Ya that was part of the game that gave me the notion of it being unfinished all the loot cave/dungeons seemed they like had planned on them being bigger with enemies. Plus your character always would say “this could prove being dangerous” or I better be careful something like that.
    "this could prove dangerous" and then there's nothing there. Mini shrines a la BOTW would have gone a long way.  

Either Hogwarts castle or the open world needed to be fun exploring. The fact that both were kind of boring because there was no depth really killed the game after the first introduction
    Too many repetitive lines like that too. I don't need to hear it every time I enter Hogsmeade. Also getting your own "shop" in hogsmeade went from very exciting to extremely disappointing the second you get it.
Agreed. I tell people that it reminds me of Skyrim's dungeons in that they felt very copy + paste, but at least Skyrim's dungeons were huge and explorable.

I stopped bothering with the Treasure Vaults in HL because all you'd get would be a piece of clothing to sell, and I had far too much money halfway through the game anyway.
Ttteeeeeechhhiiically Lord Voldermort was killed by a really powerful witch who was protecting said baby.
    Ttteeeeeechhhiiically Lord Voldermort was killed by his own powers.
        Ttteeeeeechhhiiically Lord Voldermort wasn’t killed that night
            Ttteeeeeechhhiiically Lord Voldemort split his soul that night, instead
                Ttteeeeeechhhiiically Petter Pettigrew got Voldemort's soul split that night
                Ttteeeeeechhhiiically you shouldn't say his name.
                    Ttteeeeeechhhiiically I can say Peter Pettigrew's name whenever I like
        ...through the protection given to Harry by his mother.
>I mean Lord Voldemort was killed by a baby

You seriously misinterpreted the story
    Also if memory serves Harry and his friends did decently well against the death eaters in their fifth year.  

Yeah the baby thing was me kinda being dumb though
        Meh, OOTP showed just how un-ready harry n the DA were for the tasks/duties to come. If it wasn't for dumbldore turning up in the ministry, HP would have died in book 5.

>Yeah the baby thing was me kinda being dumb though

Oh, I know, as was I.
Thinking you are, I get.

Mowing down hordes of dark wizards mere weeks after learning spells?  That I don't get.
I’m not saying the NPCs should be stopping you. Or that the dark wizards shouldn’t be attacking you.

I’m saying every wizard in that magical world has already graduated and is an experienced wizard.  The dark wizards are even especially adept at combat.  They should all trounce a 5th year when they outnumber that 5th year 6 to 1.
    >I’m saying every wizard in that magical world has already graduated and is an experienced wizard.

I mean doesn't that same problem apply to the Harry Potter books?
I agrees with all this expect for the release rush. That's not consumers, that's the investors wanting their money at the expense is the games quality. That's what happened to Cyberpunk 2077
    Except Cyberpunk 2077 had more variety in its side-quests
    Yeah the idea this is consumers pushing for rushed games is pure propaganda
        Always the same stockholders.
    Yeah this. Rushing it would be Dying Light 2. They delayed that game multiple times (having to hire new people I believe) and the consumers kept asking for it to be released, and eventually they just released it.
I would just correct they rush for investors and profits not really for consumers. Most people don’t mind waiting for a better game
>impatient consumers 

More like impatient bosses pushing to get things out faster so they can start making money asap. 

People were impatient with Cyberpunk mostly because it felt like it was in forever development, pushed back quite a lot, and it became "Is this actually ever coming out?". The development was terrible on that game from what we've heard with a lot of wasted time, then it was shoved out the door by the time they finally figured out how to properly work on it.
    I love people blaming the consumers for whenever a gane is rushed. No its not our fucking faults a game comes out shit, no developer is going to push a game because some people on the internet is upset it's taken so long. The literal only case I can see that happening is a crowd funded game where the consumers are literally the investors
Bot. This is word for word what someone else said on this thread.
To me HL commits the biggest sin that a game can, which is being BORING. I found it to be just an incredibly milquetoast, annoying, repetitive game with very little redeemable qualities. 

It was like an AC game but somehow even more lifeless. The worst part for me though is the HUD. It’s shockingly bad. There are times in that game where it feels like 50% of the screen is covered in pointless and useless pop ups and text boxes. 

Was the first game I got with my PS5 and would likely not have played it at all were it not for that. 

4/10
For me personally I bought it a few days after release and didn’t pre-order cause you never know how something will turn out

But all I saw was praise, every discussion and review said it was an extremely good game and everything is fun

So I bought it and although I don’t massively regret the purchase as I still had fun while playing about halfway in the story, I too realised it was getting really boring after and so I stopped there. I guess I got unlucky and didn’t see people bringing that part of things up lol
Same. Other than a well realised world, the pre-release stuff I saw was very generic and I had no interest, but everyone seemed to ignore the signs when I brought them up.
This is the payoff I expected. I was like I just don't think I'll get anything more from this
You didnt hear much about TOTK after a couple of months either. BoTW stayed in the conversation for much, much longer.
    BOTW was more innovative. TOTK was the sequel to that style of Zelda game
    I've literally heard nothing about it but I don't exist in Nintendo spaces as I don't have any new Ninty consoles. BOTW was everywhere regardless of console specific spaces.
        Meme sites were absolutely filled with stuff from Zelda. The vehicle building system is crazy.
    From what I’ve seen, the discourse was “it’s great” and there wasn’t much more to say about it.
    I dunno, I still see references to TOTK in a lot of places. Sure it died down since launch, but I don’t think we’ve moved on just yet.
        Nintendo shot themselves in the foot by not making it possible to share builds. I think that and only that would have kept the conversation. But truth be told from my experiences people talked about the game for no as long as they’ve talked about botw, at least my vivid memories in 2017/2018. Years later and you saw people gushing botw, but what’s their to gush about in totk? The devices really cool but they’ll mostly never have a long lasting impact on you as compared to an entirely huge new world. And no being able to share creations? Not being able to build huge enough devices without the frames tanking or materials despawning because of the switch’s low power? Forget about it. Even if most people enjoyed their time with the game what’s there to talk about
            BOTW in itself was kind of fresh when it comes to open world games. Even if it had flaws, it tried to go in a direction many open world games gave up on. That in itself would spark more discussions even after its release. The impact it could have on future games across the industry, wether it should continue in this direction or go back to old school Zelda, etc. 

TOTK doesnt do anything new. It just takes BOTW and adds some things on top. But nothing that will change the direction of the industry or anything like that. Theres nothing really to talk about other than “check out this build”. 

It also helps that at release BOTW was the only game on Switch worth buying the thing for released in a year that wasnt half as stacked as this year. People would want to talk more about it and atleast share positive experiences because they just spent like 300-400 just to play BOTW.
        I havent seen like anything aside of like 2 vids of people building mechs the game is just overrated
            Eh I still get a ton of TikTok’s about people’s builds.

But I think it’s just the algorithm feeding me those videos because I watch Nintendo-related content.
                I dont own a switch and I could not get away from botw content for a year after it launched. I've seen a few of the new one but not even close to comparable.
            And you can’t even build big enough and cool enough things without the switch tanking fps or just despawning devices if you go to far away💀
    I'm still extremely disappointed in that game. Mostly because of sky islands. It's almost like they intentionally misled us in the trailers. They made it look like we were going to a lot of big cool sky islands to explore. Nope. We only get 1 island that we can explore. The rest exist only for puzzles and shrines.

I just wanted to rush through the game after I realized there's no more cool sky islands. That was kind of the selling point of the game for me... I wanted to explore the sky, not hop around tiny islands to find easy shrines or flux constructs..
    TOTK still dominates my tiktok. Not much, but it has more stayingpower thsn HL
        That's just the algorithm
    TOTK was BOTW+ contraptions. Six years to get it.

I finished BOTW. I've abandoned TOTK. Almost everything in it is something from BOTW. Weird monster guy who is a moving trader? You saw him in BOTW. Company that allows you to build a house? Saw it in BOTW. Where's the fun in discovering things you've already seen?

The whole thing just felt unexciting. BOTW felt fresh, TOTK felt stale.
        I agree with you. Sorry you got downvoted by rabid Nintendo fanboys
            Thanks !

I actually love zelda games usually.
    Yeah I'm glad people have started to realise how mediocre the open world Zelda formula is, they're a joke if you've played enough open world games already
        Exactly. I played BotW expecting some grand open world and was like… this is it? I paid $60 for this?
    I still hear plenty about that to be fair, but it just didn't have the same luxury of nothing coming out worth talking about just before or after it like Breath of the Wild had.
    Bet. Still seeibg constant inventions online because of the creativity of its sandbox system.
That’s a completely different player base though
I hate abbreviations so much.  What is TOTK?
    Legend of Zelda: Tears of The Kingdom
    Tears of the Kingdom (Zelda sequel on switch)
Jedi survivor too
    Havent heard shit about Jedi Survivor a week after release though
        And honestly most of what I heard about Jedi Survivor during that week was the performance issues, not how good of a sequel it is.
            Jedi survivor is ez goty so far not even close
        Maybe im just plugged into the right circles. I love that game
            The game (gameplay, story, visuals) was fantastic. Severely let down by performance issues though which was a major shame.
                I tried playing it at launch but the performance issues were really really bad, have they been fixed yet?
                    Not when I last played (PS5, around a month ago)
        Really? I heard quite a bit how it was an amazing sequel and after playing it I agree. 

I know there’s performance issues but I didn’t experience them on Xbox. I’ve heard it’s a lot worse on PC though.
    Jedi what?
Tears of the kingdom and Breath of the wild are not great games. There, I said it.
    “I don’t care that you broke your arm”
I'm completely convinced that if TOTK came out in PC and more consoles it'd have the GOTY 

Such an amazing game, the best one I've played since Elden Ring
the reason is called from software, com’on.
TOTK is mid though? maybe 7/10 imo the mechanics are great but it became meh afterwards.
I don't know why you got downvoted. 2023 is genuinely one of the best years in gaming ever. Hogwarts Legacy, Zelda: TOTK, Star Wars Jedi Survivor, Street Fighter 6, Baldurs Gate 3, Cyberpunk Phantom Liberty, Starfield, Spiderman 2. Man... I can't keep up with all these releases. Genuinley GOATed
    Honestly it’s probably because “the best year in gaming” is something everybody has very different opinions on. This is a very good year in gaming, no doubt. I don’t know if it cracks my top five years though.
        I'd say for as long as I've been into the 'gaming sphere' (from 2010 onwards, before that I was really young and mainly playing Nintendo games), 2010, 2011, 2013, 2017, 2018 and 2023 have been the primary standout years
            See I got into gaming about a decade before you so seeing a list of best years without 2001, 2004 and 2007 is crazy to me.
    Probably for saying it would be a serious contender. Don't know about that. Every year the last 10 years has a few games that I would rate above it.    
It made very good use of the IP, I think. And that's a good thing. Often enough games that are based on these big IPs severely disappoint and it didn't. It was quite solid. Not outstanding though.
    It's probally more to do with people not liking the game, which I didn't know was a controversial opinion.
Lol it’s not even a top 10 game so far this year.

Game is absolutely pointless past the first 10 hours.

It’s not much better than the next Ubisoft game.
I could definitely see someone who’s perhaps younger stating that. 

My era is 97 onwards and there were some truly phenomenal years. It really went to shit past 2013 I think though and we’re perhaps now getting back on track.
    I've been playing video games for alot longer than the last 10 years.

I couldn't afford as many games as I wanted then. In 2012 I could maybe get a game or two, when they released. Maybe another game or two for Christmas.

Im an adult now and can budget what I want to games, so if a year is great I can buy them all at release.
Star Wars Jedi, TOTK, Street Fighter 6, MK1, Resident Evil 4, Dead Space Remake, Diablo 4. And I could keep going, if necessary. There are so many options, 2023 has been an exceptional year.
    you forgot hi fi rush!
        Hifi Rush wouod literary deserve it. This game is so good in every thinkable way. The humor the fighting, the world, the artstyle, the characters, everything was executed almost perfectly.
            Easily the best game released this year.
    Where’s starfield?
    I’d hold off on MK1 just because it hasn’t been released yet. Outside of that though, completely agree
    Yeah, 2023 has been my favourite year in gaming in a long ass time, since 2007 most likely. The other guy commenting clearly doesn't have much of a clue.
    Diablo 4. Aged like milk
    I was with you but Diablo 4 sucks, so now I don't know if those other games are good or not
    Okay, I will concede. When I first read this comment I looked at it through the lens of GOTY which none of those games you mentioned would get it realistically. Other than Zelda which I mentioned.
        Again, you would be incorrect. Some of these could certainly be nominated for GOTY, there’s nothing to stop them. Naturally, not all of them. GOTY is a select group of games.
            Star Wars Jedi maybe, but what else? Just seems like a stretch imo. I’m not saying they aren’t good games, not my cup of tea but I’ll be shocked if any win let alone get nominated.
                What games from 2023 do you see winning if not one of the AAA titles listed above?
                    None of the remakes or fighting games tbh. Those serve a much smaller crowd and aren’t anything we haven’t seen before. I don’t see hogwarts winning but prob will get nominated, baldurs gate potentially, starfield I’d imagine. Armored core potentially. But really just those. I felt like this year has been an absolute drought. I played dead space and hogwarts but the other games are just reskins etc imo.
                        And hogwarts legacy is the worse reskin of all, a pretty generic and bland ubisoft open world reskin, with somehow even worse story and characters (I didn't hate the game, fulfilled a small itch but after the first section and first "wow cool hogwarts" gets stale asf).

RE4 remake, TOTK, FF16, will be nominees, then you have massive hitters like starfield, spiderman, armor core as you said. There is very little chance hogwarts gets nominated, and if it does, it will strictly be because it's Harry Potter and hp stans are something else.

But we all know TOTK will win. It's not my choice personally, but it will win most likely
        I think Zelda is likely the winner here by a mile but I do see BG3 getting the upset win as TGA likes to do that. Also, if Starfield is at its best case scenario, I can see that sweeping the game awards too
Star Wars, final fantasy xvi, Diablo 4, pikmin 4. Still to come Starfield, spider-man 2. 

Ton of other minor games as well.
You’re kidding right? This year we got: 
dead space R
Resident evil 4 R
HiFi rush
Metroid prime R
Diablo 4
Final Fantasy 16
Street fighter 6 
Jedi Survivor 
Wo Long
Zelda
Pikmim 4
Renment 2
Bauldrs gate 3

And games coming up:
Armored core
Starfield 
Cyberpunk dlc
Spider-Man 2
Super Mario wonder
Alan wake 2
Payday 3
Mortal kombat 1
Lies of P

Not to mention fantastic indie games like pizza tower, battlebit, bomb rush cyberfunk 

This year has been absolutely FANTASTIC for games. I honestly can’t even put Hogwarts in my top 10 games for this year. 2023 has been and no doubt will continue to be a great year
Diablo 4, Zelda, Baldurs Gate, Star Wars, FF16. Those are just the ones out now, and the “big ones”. Still had couple great remakes, and still have a lot to come out still. 

Starfield, Spider-Man, Armored Core, Alan Wake 2. 

2023 is one of the better years in gaming we’ve had.
If you're willing to include remakes/remasters we got Metroid Prime, Resident Evil 4, & Dead Space. New games we got Diablo 4, Final Fantasy and Jedi Survivor. Plus we've gotten one of the best indies ever in Pizza Tower. It's been a solid year.

Plus we've got Armored Core and Spiderman coming out soon. Sucks that basically every game that I've named is a sequel tho.
The Star Wars game, new Mario at end of year, Diablo 4, final fantasy 16, resident evil 4 remake (I think was this year?), dead space remake, street fighter 6, mortal kombat 1 (I think is due this year), Mario rpg remake at end of year, battle bit has been a big hit it seems

A lot of these games don’t interest me but I mean this has to be the best year for gaming since COVID I’d not one of the top 5-10 years of all time.

It’s a great time to be a gamer.
    I feel like every game that was meant to come in 2021-2022 got delayed due to COVID and landed all in 2023. It's insane
        Yeah there is quite a bit I didn’t mention also like Spider-Man 2 and a few others. It is a great year.
True, it’s not a good game if you’re looking at it from that perspective. I’m only looking at it in terms of fun for me though, and since I’m the protagonist in the game…it works. 

I wouldn’t watch it in real life, if that were a thing.
    I think if there was a mechanism that the seeker was reassigned intramatch, quidditch would be immediately a good exciting game.
    >since I’m the protagonist in the game…it works.

Fair enough, I thought you wanted to get assigned to quidditch teams and be like, a chaser or a beater or seeker at random, that type of stuff. Uh, dibs on seeker!
        Ah hell no! Lol

Keeper might be a little fun, but we all know seeker is *the* fun position.

The rest suck.
That's not true though? Catching the snitch gives you 150 points and finishes the game, it's not a win. If the opposing team could manage to score 160 points by quaffle goals and you catch the snitch but team scored no goals, you lose. Beaters have to stall, guardians defend their rings, etc. All of them are meaningful. What's special about seekers is that only a handful can do it, since it's an extremely fast and invisible ball.
There were multiple world Cup matches that lasted 10 hours, the record being an entire month.
    Honestly the way to fix it is to just put the matches on a timer. If your team catches the snitch within time, you win. If no one catches the snitch then the team that scored the most points wins.
        You nailed it. Such a stupid simple fix that gives more weight to scoring points
    I just think 150 points is too much. It should be a lot, should be a near certain game-winning move to catch the snitch. But to have to be +150 up on an opponent in order to not lose if your seeker couldn’t perform is just rawww lol
    But why would you catch the snitch knowing your team will lose as a result?
        I actually think that happens in the book at one point. Idk, been years since I read them. I don't remember the reasoning
            It does, in the World Cup that Harry attends (Goblet of Fire). I can't remember the justification for doing it at the time.
Supposedly the sequels are gonna be at the other schools of witchcraft and wizardry
    I actually like this idea more. It gives them plenty of creative liberty to make something new and fresh in a world filled with uninspired sequels.
        On the one hand, it does sound like it could be great for creative purposes but on the other, the Hogwarts world is easily the best part of the game so moving on from that feels like a gigantic risk.
    Attending a Triwizard Tournament hosted at another school would be a really easy reason for The Student to be at a different school for a year, regardless if they are a champion or not.
    Ohh that's dope!
    Ya, paying for the image rights of the original cast would bankrupt the game😂
    Aw man that sounds so cool! If they tune up some of the major community complaints they could create an absolute masterpiece.
    Source: Trust me bro
    Nah nobody would buy that shit lmao. Try to convince a casual Harry Potter fan that they will spend the story in Durmstrang. Maybe super fans and that's about it. 

You can forget about any non Harry Potter fan
TOTK improved literally on no BOTW elements. They added a sandbox creator and that’s it. There’s no overhaul to combat, traversal is even worse for like the first 20 hours with no paraglider, the underground is absolute dogshit, they didn’t even add a quick eat menu etc etc TOTK is the biggest disappointment to a sequel I’ve ever played haven’t touched that after 30hours and never plan on coming back
idk the Harry Potter and the Chamber Of secrets for Ps2 was super cool using your boom to fly around
    Yes that one was also really good. Though I never got far as the ghosts scared the shit out of me.

The third games capitalised on the entire thing some more, even if the flying unlocks rather late. (Post game I believe).

I actually even liked the fourth game even though most people despise it. It is certainly a different genre but if you figure out the controls it becomes quite the expansive game as there is so much shit you can do.
I didn't expect to see a comment praising the PS2 version of PoA but I kinda agree.
Just sucks that we paid full price for the backbone, when the entire world’s been fleshed out already.
    Eh, personally I got my monies worth from it. Things I wish they did different or better for sure. But definitely enjoyed it
        Yeah, true. You’re right, I definitely enjoyed myself for the time I played it. I just couldn’t help myself from thinking what they could’ve done better. The best part to me personally was the exploration, since the combat became rock-paper-scissors(final boss especially). 

But then exploration felt more like standard dungeon crawling for mediocre rewards, or a set piece that was somehow more defined in the movies than a video game, like the Restricted Section or the Chamber of Secrets. Even the House rooms are lacking.
    Ehh. I think a game with 50+ hours worth of content, open-world, great gameplay, base-building features, fantastic beast collecting features is more than just a backbone
The older games had more content? Were you smoking weed while playing time?
    They had more playable content yeah.

I don't like running around for hours to collect useless information. 

It's my perception about the game though, feel free to disagree.
        I might have played the wrong HP game, but they sure as hell did not have more playable content. That is objectively not true. 

Though I can accept the perception part. As a kid, everything seems much bigger than it is. You could 100% these games in 8-15h.
            Probably. I still have it sitting on my desk as I recently played through Pokemon Platinum.

Now I'm tempted to race through all of them and compare it to my playtime of Hogwarts Legacy which is accurate as I quit the game after the last quest and never thouched it since.
The new level of depth is how deep into a battlepass can you go... I hate it.
If its on sale absolutely. Its not a bad game as much as its just an average game. I did have fun playing it, it just didnt keep my attention like i expected it to. But i bet it was great for a lot of people who played it.
Perfect comparison
You also only went to class maybe 8 times
    The way they handled class also sucked. You pretty much just watch a cutscene. I never felt like a student
        That was possibly my main irk. I actually really enjoyed the games and duels you do in DADA and Charms on your first day, and was excited for more. Then you're just sort of let loose, occasionally coming back to learn a new spell after a cutscene. Ah well.
I've heard that a lot, but I'm not sure I believe it. This was AAA game produced by a major publisher, with one of the biggest IPs in the world. Boycott or not, everybody was going to hear about this.
I paid ~£55 for the Deluxe edition and was mildly underwhelmed, the extras seemed pretty useless and the only decent bonus was a Playstation exclusive. Still enjoyed the game, but would've just got the base edition in hindsight.
I took advice from a few early players and turned off my mini map and quest markers so I ran through Hogwarts blind. I continued to run it blind until I could navigate the halls. It sounds silly, but I felt like a new student. I can't tell you how many times I ran into the dungeon thinking I was going to Ravenclaw tower. Definitely the one thing I'll always remember from this game :)
That's honestly a fair point. I kept going back and forth between 4 and 6. Like, the premise is interesting yeah? But at the end of the day they kept it as it was. Honestly, you're right, I should have written 4. Will edit
The absolute worst feeling was being hyped up by a Mass Effect style companion system (after talking with NPCs in the common room on day 1) only to never talk with them again outside of an extremely repetitive sidequest each.
> For comparison I went back and played Mass Effect. Now that’s a game where you can roleplay. You can be a dick who doesn’t obey any of the rules, you can be by the book, you can be both depending on your mood, you can pick who to romance, you can form friendships with any one you want on the Normandy.

And that stuff has consequences throughout the games.  Not just shallow consequences. There's choices in ME1 that can make parts of ME3 easier or harder.  A lot of ME2 ends up determining who, if anyone, will survive the final mission, which also means who might be around in ME3.  I can't remember what the ramifications all were, but pretty sure that depending on what you do at the end of ME1, that has some notable repercussions later as well.

Shoot, now I feel like booting up Mass Effect.  But BG3 just came out.  And also F1 Manager 2023, which is a whole different type of game, but hey, I'm a major Formula 1 fan and we just hit the "summer break" part of the season.  Need more time in my day to play games...
"Go fuck yourself"

-JKR
It’s the IP of a terf
The difference is it's a lot easier to not buy a singular videogame than it is to participate in society without consuming at least some products produced by awful practices or people.
Well, if I can’t 100% guarantee all of my consumption is ethical, why bother trying at all?
Most people don’t know who Blackrock or Larry Fink are
    Yep and I bet it's exactly what blackrock wants
Eh, I've picked my struggle
You sound a lot pettier than them.
You aren't going to get an answer from a virtue signaler lol.
There was a huge fake campaign against it because it "didn't have any politica agenda" in it. It did have it.
    And what political agenda got your panties in a twist?
        Well by your answer you clearly already know and you have your pink hair and pitchfork ready. Nevermind
            I have no idea what you're talking about actually. And I'm not much of a Harry Potter fan, but found the game fun and simple. It sounds like you're the one with a problem here.
            Only there isn't a political agenda in it lol. Unless you consider one single trans person existing in the world is political. And that was an optional side quest
*sneaking*

*"Revelio"*

Otherwise you're just running around towns and the castle yelling REVELIO
    I like that because if it wasn't part of the game we'd be fuuukd, you can also shut it off if you want a better challenge. Mess with the settings. Make a new character because each has a similar yet different story , its only as boring as you make it
Lmao
Yeah I think I'm 2/3 through. Play a few hours every now and then.

I loved exploring Hogwarts itself, but the open world areas aside from that are pretty meh. And omg the junky loot system
    The first few hours and exploring Hogwarts is where the game shines. They brought the Hogwarts *to life*

But then all the shortcomings arrive. You can't really make friends or adventure together; you make acquaintances that provide you fetch quests. The open world is repetitive. Going to class is so sporadic it breaks the immersion the first few hours provided.

I enjoyed the voice acting, the combat was decent, but overall it just failed to deliver upon the promise the first several hours held
        The classes! God I wish there was anything that felt like a real class and the real routine of a school.
            Also I forget the name of that game with the balls that's basically shuffleboard with extra steps but it was so much fun!

But then you do the quests for it and it's gone. They could have made that a persistent side game with a league, and it would have been the best side game since blitzball
                I was so surprised that they didn't let you play that after the quest was over. For a game with so much attention to detail that was quite disappointing.
        Limiting you to 4 spells at a time both makes no sense and was very frustrating. Gimme like a wow style toolbar
    The loot system feels to be an exact copy of AC odyssey/origin (I haven't played Valhalla)
        Yeah, I hate all the junk it fills the inventory with.
I finally finished Hogwarts, needed to get space back on my drive.

And valhalla has a different system, you find single pieces in specific places and upgrade them.
I pushed through, but I mean, the story is serviceable I guess, I do regret buying it though, I think it was the whole "i wanna do magic" thing that made me buy it but after getting like 1 good spell setup you don't need to switch to anything else and its just repetitive quests and an OK story.
    I borrowed it from my local library, completed main side missions and killed the final boss on hardest difficulty, I think the game has fun learning curve. As a huge potter fan it was 10/10 experience for no money. If I would've purchased the game for 80€ I think would've regretted it too.
        I think the key is, you're a huge fan of Harry Potter which is what brings the game to a 10, if you weren't a fan, what would you rate it? I'd say maybe a 6.5
    I haven't played it, so perhaps my opinion is shit, but when the game was first announced, I was worried about how the combat was gonna play out.

Since it's a AAA game, it was more than likely to go for "tried and true" mechanics, mechanics that every  other AAA game might use.             
I was dreading the game's spell battling being a "pew pew" mage fight. A shooter in all respects except reskinned to be magical. 

Imo, a (good) Harry Potter game's combat should never (or only rarely) ever be "combat" as we are used to.             
In my mind, encounters should actually be a puzzle game, reskinned to look like combat. 

In a way, something akin to Hitman. There are a dozen ways you can locate, approach, and dispatch your target(s). Hitman may technically be a stealth-shooter, but really, it's a puzzle game.

That's what I hoped(without holding my breath) this game would be.
Worst was searching for the animals and pair them up. Everything else was pretty nicely done tbh
Don't trust reviews anymore.

I stopped after TOTK. Great game but damn, a lot of reviewers completely ignored all its flaws such as performance, repetitive dialogue, and the sky islands..

The sky islands was the most disappointing part. They advertised the game like we would be spending a ton of time up there. Nope. There's only one big one and that's for the tutorial. The rest exist just for stupid shrines and some armor that you've seen in the last game...cool
Why...?
C'mon bro, no one was saying Hogwarts would be GOTY when it came out the same year as ToTK.
    I'm on the same page as you but it's true that the hype for Hogwarts Legacy was huge when it dropped. People were definitely gassing it up as a GoTY contender in the first week or so, now not so much lol
    Trans people were.
Baldur's Gate 3 and Starfield. Gonna be a good fall.
    This comment did not age well
        Yeah lmao starfield filled about two weeks for me before I got bored and sick of it. Can't blame a guy for being hopeful! At least I had Baldur's Gate.
            hell yeah! And I bet BG3 even exceeded your already high expectations
Nobody who has more than surface level knowledge of games considered it even a contender in a year that has Zelda, FF16, Baldurs Gate 3, Resident Evil 4, Starfield, etc. Itll be lucky if its nominated for anything other than “biggest media impact”
    Starfield lmao
    Lol Zelda runs like shit unless you emulate it 🤷‍♂️
*opens door* hallo. Nah, zelda tears of the kingdom is already here. *door closes*
    Only thing TOTK has going for it is the Garry's mod creation tools.
    TotK was polarizing.  People who played Elden Ring felt like both of those zelda games were shadows of Elden Ring, the durability is hated by many, I know several people who hated sticking junk on their weapons so much they never got far enough in the game to get cool looking attachments.

Baldur's Gate hasn't been out long enough to judge, but the initial reaction is overwhelmingly positive.  It's got one of the highest concurrent player counts on steam of all time.  TotK is top three, but unless there are some serious issues in BG3 come late game, I don't see anything else competing for GotY.
As long as every character in Baldur's Gate 3 is some cis person? It will never be GOTY.
"this could prove dangerous" and then there's nothing there. Mini shrines a la BOTW would have gone a long way.  

Either Hogwarts castle or the open world needed to be fun exploring. The fact that both were kind of boring because there was no depth really killed the game after the first introduction
Too many repetitive lines like that too. I don't need to hear it every time I enter Hogsmeade. Also getting your own "shop" in hogsmeade went from very exciting to extremely disappointing the second you get it.
Ttteeeeeechhhiiically Lord Voldermort was killed by his own powers.
    Ttteeeeeechhhiiically Lord Voldermort wasn’t killed that night
        Ttteeeeeechhhiiically Lord Voldemort split his soul that night, instead
            Ttteeeeeechhhiiically Petter Pettigrew got Voldemort's soul split that night
            Ttteeeeeechhhiiically you shouldn't say his name.
                Ttteeeeeechhhiiically I can say Peter Pettigrew's name whenever I like
    ...through the protection given to Harry by his mother.
Also if memory serves Harry and his friends did decently well against the death eaters in their fifth year.  

Yeah the baby thing was me kinda being dumb though
    Meh, OOTP showed just how un-ready harry n the DA were for the tasks/duties to come. If it wasn't for dumbldore turning up in the ministry, HP would have died in book 5.

>Yeah the baby thing was me kinda being dumb though

Oh, I know, as was I.
>I’m saying every wizard in that magical world has already graduated and is an experienced wizard.

I mean doesn't that same problem apply to the Harry Potter books?
Except Cyberpunk 2077 had more variety in its side-quests
Yeah the idea this is consumers pushing for rushed games is pure propaganda
    Always the same stockholders.
Yeah this. Rushing it would be Dying Light 2. They delayed that game multiple times (having to hire new people I believe) and the consumers kept asking for it to be released, and eventually they just released it.
I love people blaming the consumers for whenever a gane is rushed. No its not our fucking faults a game comes out shit, no developer is going to push a game because some people on the internet is upset it's taken so long. The literal only case I can see that happening is a crowd funded game where the consumers are literally the investors
BOTW was more innovative. TOTK was the sequel to that style of Zelda game
I've literally heard nothing about it but I don't exist in Nintendo spaces as I don't have any new Ninty consoles. BOTW was everywhere regardless of console specific spaces.
    Meme sites were absolutely filled with stuff from Zelda. The vehicle building system is crazy.
From what I’ve seen, the discourse was “it’s great” and there wasn’t much more to say about it.
I dunno, I still see references to TOTK in a lot of places. Sure it died down since launch, but I don’t think we’ve moved on just yet.
    Nintendo shot themselves in the foot by not making it possible to share builds. I think that and only that would have kept the conversation. But truth be told from my experiences people talked about the game for no as long as they’ve talked about botw, at least my vivid memories in 2017/2018. Years later and you saw people gushing botw, but what’s their to gush about in totk? The devices really cool but they’ll mostly never have a long lasting impact on you as compared to an entirely huge new world. And no being able to share creations? Not being able to build huge enough devices without the frames tanking or materials despawning because of the switch’s low power? Forget about it. Even if most people enjoyed their time with the game what’s there to talk about
        BOTW in itself was kind of fresh when it comes to open world games. Even if it had flaws, it tried to go in a direction many open world games gave up on. That in itself would spark more discussions even after its release. The impact it could have on future games across the industry, wether it should continue in this direction or go back to old school Zelda, etc. 

TOTK doesnt do anything new. It just takes BOTW and adds some things on top. But nothing that will change the direction of the industry or anything like that. Theres nothing really to talk about other than “check out this build”. 

It also helps that at release BOTW was the only game on Switch worth buying the thing for released in a year that wasnt half as stacked as this year. People would want to talk more about it and atleast share positive experiences because they just spent like 300-400 just to play BOTW.
    I havent seen like anything aside of like 2 vids of people building mechs the game is just overrated
        Eh I still get a ton of TikTok’s about people’s builds.

But I think it’s just the algorithm feeding me those videos because I watch Nintendo-related content.
            I dont own a switch and I could not get away from botw content for a year after it launched. I've seen a few of the new one but not even close to comparable.
        And you can’t even build big enough and cool enough things without the switch tanking fps or just despawning devices if you go to far away💀
I'm still extremely disappointed in that game. Mostly because of sky islands. It's almost like they intentionally misled us in the trailers. They made it look like we were going to a lot of big cool sky islands to explore. Nope. We only get 1 island that we can explore. The rest exist only for puzzles and shrines.

I just wanted to rush through the game after I realized there's no more cool sky islands. That was kind of the selling point of the game for me... I wanted to explore the sky, not hop around tiny islands to find easy shrines or flux constructs..
TOTK still dominates my tiktok. Not much, but it has more stayingpower thsn HL
    That's just the algorithm
TOTK was BOTW+ contraptions. Six years to get it.

I finished BOTW. I've abandoned TOTK. Almost everything in it is something from BOTW. Weird monster guy who is a moving trader? You saw him in BOTW. Company that allows you to build a house? Saw it in BOTW. Where's the fun in discovering things you've already seen?

The whole thing just felt unexciting. BOTW felt fresh, TOTK felt stale.
    I agree with you. Sorry you got downvoted by rabid Nintendo fanboys
        Thanks !

I actually love zelda games usually.
Yeah I'm glad people have started to realise how mediocre the open world Zelda formula is, they're a joke if you've played enough open world games already
    Exactly. I played BotW expecting some grand open world and was like… this is it? I paid $60 for this?
I still hear plenty about that to be fair, but it just didn't have the same luxury of nothing coming out worth talking about just before or after it like Breath of the Wild had.
Bet. Still seeibg constant inventions online because of the creativity of its sandbox system.
Legend of Zelda: Tears of The Kingdom
Tears of the Kingdom (Zelda sequel on switch)
Havent heard shit about Jedi Survivor a week after release though
    And honestly most of what I heard about Jedi Survivor during that week was the performance issues, not how good of a sequel it is.
        Jedi survivor is ez goty so far not even close
    Maybe im just plugged into the right circles. I love that game
        The game (gameplay, story, visuals) was fantastic. Severely let down by performance issues though which was a major shame.
            I tried playing it at launch but the performance issues were really really bad, have they been fixed yet?
                Not when I last played (PS5, around a month ago)
    Really? I heard quite a bit how it was an amazing sequel and after playing it I agree. 

I know there’s performance issues but I didn’t experience them on Xbox. I’ve heard it’s a lot worse on PC though.
Jedi what?
“I don’t care that you broke your arm”
Honestly it’s probably because “the best year in gaming” is something everybody has very different opinions on. This is a very good year in gaming, no doubt. I don’t know if it cracks my top five years though.
    I'd say for as long as I've been into the 'gaming sphere' (from 2010 onwards, before that I was really young and mainly playing Nintendo games), 2010, 2011, 2013, 2017, 2018 and 2023 have been the primary standout years
        See I got into gaming about a decade before you so seeing a list of best years without 2001, 2004 and 2007 is crazy to me.
Probably for saying it would be a serious contender. Don't know about that. Every year the last 10 years has a few games that I would rate above it.    
It made very good use of the IP, I think. And that's a good thing. Often enough games that are based on these big IPs severely disappoint and it didn't. It was quite solid. Not outstanding though.
It's probally more to do with people not liking the game, which I didn't know was a controversial opinion.
I've been playing video games for alot longer than the last 10 years.

I couldn't afford as many games as I wanted then. In 2012 I could maybe get a game or two, when they released. Maybe another game or two for Christmas.

Im an adult now and can budget what I want to games, so if a year is great I can buy them all at release.
you forgot hi fi rush!
    Hifi Rush wouod literary deserve it. This game is so good in every thinkable way. The humor the fighting, the world, the artstyle, the characters, everything was executed almost perfectly.
        Easily the best game released this year.
Where’s starfield?
I’d hold off on MK1 just because it hasn’t been released yet. Outside of that though, completely agree
Yeah, 2023 has been my favourite year in gaming in a long ass time, since 2007 most likely. The other guy commenting clearly doesn't have much of a clue.
Diablo 4. Aged like milk
I was with you but Diablo 4 sucks, so now I don't know if those other games are good or not
Okay, I will concede. When I first read this comment I looked at it through the lens of GOTY which none of those games you mentioned would get it realistically. Other than Zelda which I mentioned.
    Again, you would be incorrect. Some of these could certainly be nominated for GOTY, there’s nothing to stop them. Naturally, not all of them. GOTY is a select group of games.
        Star Wars Jedi maybe, but what else? Just seems like a stretch imo. I’m not saying they aren’t good games, not my cup of tea but I’ll be shocked if any win let alone get nominated.
            What games from 2023 do you see winning if not one of the AAA titles listed above?
                None of the remakes or fighting games tbh. Those serve a much smaller crowd and aren’t anything we haven’t seen before. I don’t see hogwarts winning but prob will get nominated, baldurs gate potentially, starfield I’d imagine. Armored core potentially. But really just those. I felt like this year has been an absolute drought. I played dead space and hogwarts but the other games are just reskins etc imo.
                    And hogwarts legacy is the worse reskin of all, a pretty generic and bland ubisoft open world reskin, with somehow even worse story and characters (I didn't hate the game, fulfilled a small itch but after the first section and first "wow cool hogwarts" gets stale asf).

RE4 remake, TOTK, FF16, will be nominees, then you have massive hitters like starfield, spiderman, armor core as you said. There is very little chance hogwarts gets nominated, and if it does, it will strictly be because it's Harry Potter and hp stans are something else.

But we all know TOTK will win. It's not my choice personally, but it will win most likely
    I think Zelda is likely the winner here by a mile but I do see BG3 getting the upset win as TGA likes to do that. Also, if Starfield is at its best case scenario, I can see that sweeping the game awards too
I feel like every game that was meant to come in 2021-2022 got delayed due to COVID and landed all in 2023. It's insane
    Yeah there is quite a bit I didn’t mention also like Spider-Man 2 and a few others. It is a great year.
I think if there was a mechanism that the seeker was reassigned intramatch, quidditch would be immediately a good exciting game.
>since I’m the protagonist in the game…it works.

Fair enough, I thought you wanted to get assigned to quidditch teams and be like, a chaser or a beater or seeker at random, that type of stuff. Uh, dibs on seeker!
    Ah hell no! Lol

Keeper might be a little fun, but we all know seeker is *the* fun position.

The rest suck.
Honestly the way to fix it is to just put the matches on a timer. If your team catches the snitch within time, you win. If no one catches the snitch then the team that scored the most points wins.
    You nailed it. Such a stupid simple fix that gives more weight to scoring points
I just think 150 points is too much. It should be a lot, should be a near certain game-winning move to catch the snitch. But to have to be +150 up on an opponent in order to not lose if your seeker couldn’t perform is just rawww lol
But why would you catch the snitch knowing your team will lose as a result?
    I actually think that happens in the book at one point. Idk, been years since I read them. I don't remember the reasoning
        It does, in the World Cup that Harry attends (Goblet of Fire). I can't remember the justification for doing it at the time.
I actually like this idea more. It gives them plenty of creative liberty to make something new and fresh in a world filled with uninspired sequels.
    On the one hand, it does sound like it could be great for creative purposes but on the other, the Hogwarts world is easily the best part of the game so moving on from that feels like a gigantic risk.
Attending a Triwizard Tournament hosted at another school would be a really easy reason for The Student to be at a different school for a year, regardless if they are a champion or not.
Ohh that's dope!
Ya, paying for the image rights of the original cast would bankrupt the game😂
Aw man that sounds so cool! If they tune up some of the major community complaints they could create an absolute masterpiece.
Source: Trust me bro
Nah nobody would buy that shit lmao. Try to convince a casual Harry Potter fan that they will spend the story in Durmstrang. Maybe super fans and that's about it. 

You can forget about any non Harry Potter fan
Yes that one was also really good. Though I never got far as the ghosts scared the shit out of me.

The third games capitalised on the entire thing some more, even if the flying unlocks rather late. (Post game I believe).

I actually even liked the fourth game even though most people despise it. It is certainly a different genre but if you figure out the controls it becomes quite the expansive game as there is so much shit you can do.
Eh, personally I got my monies worth from it. Things I wish they did different or better for sure. But definitely enjoyed it
    Yeah, true. You’re right, I definitely enjoyed myself for the time I played it. I just couldn’t help myself from thinking what they could’ve done better. The best part to me personally was the exploration, since the combat became rock-paper-scissors(final boss especially). 

But then exploration felt more like standard dungeon crawling for mediocre rewards, or a set piece that was somehow more defined in the movies than a video game, like the Restricted Section or the Chamber of Secrets. Even the House rooms are lacking.
Ehh. I think a game with 50+ hours worth of content, open-world, great gameplay, base-building features, fantastic beast collecting features is more than just a backbone
They had more playable content yeah.

I don't like running around for hours to collect useless information. 

It's my perception about the game though, feel free to disagree.
    I might have played the wrong HP game, but they sure as hell did not have more playable content. That is objectively not true. 

Though I can accept the perception part. As a kid, everything seems much bigger than it is. You could 100% these games in 8-15h.
        Probably. I still have it sitting on my desk as I recently played through Pokemon Platinum.

Now I'm tempted to race through all of them and compare it to my playtime of Hogwarts Legacy which is accurate as I quit the game after the last quest and never thouched it since.
The way they handled class also sucked. You pretty much just watch a cutscene. I never felt like a student
    That was possibly my main irk. I actually really enjoyed the games and duels you do in DADA and Charms on your first day, and was excited for more. Then you're just sort of let loose, occasionally coming back to learn a new spell after a cutscene. Ah well.
Yep and I bet it's exactly what blackrock wants
And what political agenda got your panties in a twist?
    Well by your answer you clearly already know and you have your pink hair and pitchfork ready. Nevermind
        I have no idea what you're talking about actually. And I'm not much of a Harry Potter fan, but found the game fun and simple. It sounds like you're the one with a problem here.
        Only there isn't a political agenda in it lol. Unless you consider one single trans person existing in the world is political. And that was an optional side quest
I like that because if it wasn't part of the game we'd be fuuukd, you can also shut it off if you want a better challenge. Mess with the settings. Make a new character because each has a similar yet different story , its only as boring as you make it
The first few hours and exploring Hogwarts is where the game shines. They brought the Hogwarts *to life*

But then all the shortcomings arrive. You can't really make friends or adventure together; you make acquaintances that provide you fetch quests. The open world is repetitive. Going to class is so sporadic it breaks the immersion the first few hours provided.

I enjoyed the voice acting, the combat was decent, but overall it just failed to deliver upon the promise the first several hours held
    The classes! God I wish there was anything that felt like a real class and the real routine of a school.
        Also I forget the name of that game with the balls that's basically shuffleboard with extra steps but it was so much fun!

But then you do the quests for it and it's gone. They could have made that a persistent side game with a league, and it would have been the best side game since blitzball
            I was so surprised that they didn't let you play that after the quest was over. For a game with so much attention to detail that was quite disappointing.
    Limiting you to 4 spells at a time both makes no sense and was very frustrating. Gimme like a wow style toolbar
The loot system feels to be an exact copy of AC odyssey/origin (I haven't played Valhalla)
    Yeah, I hate all the junk it fills the inventory with.
I finally finished Hogwarts, needed to get space back on my drive.

And valhalla has a different system, you find single pieces in specific places and upgrade them.
I borrowed it from my local library, completed main side missions and killed the final boss on hardest difficulty, I think the game has fun learning curve. As a huge potter fan it was 10/10 experience for no money. If I would've purchased the game for 80€ I think would've regretted it too.
    I think the key is, you're a huge fan of Harry Potter which is what brings the game to a 10, if you weren't a fan, what would you rate it? I'd say maybe a 6.5
I haven't played it, so perhaps my opinion is shit, but when the game was first announced, I was worried about how the combat was gonna play out.

Since it's a AAA game, it was more than likely to go for "tried and true" mechanics, mechanics that every  other AAA game might use.             
I was dreading the game's spell battling being a "pew pew" mage fight. A shooter in all respects except reskinned to be magical. 

Imo, a (good) Harry Potter game's combat should never (or only rarely) ever be "combat" as we are used to.             
In my mind, encounters should actually be a puzzle game, reskinned to look like combat. 

In a way, something akin to Hitman. There are a dozen ways you can locate, approach, and dispatch your target(s). Hitman may technically be a stealth-shooter, but really, it's a puzzle game.

That's what I hoped(without holding my breath) this game would be.
I'm on the same page as you but it's true that the hype for Hogwarts Legacy was huge when it dropped. People were definitely gassing it up as a GoTY contender in the first week or so, now not so much lol
Trans people were.
This comment did not age well
    Yeah lmao starfield filled about two weeks for me before I got bored and sick of it. Can't blame a guy for being hopeful! At least I had Baldur's Gate.
        hell yeah! And I bet BG3 even exceeded your already high expectations
Starfield lmao
Lol Zelda runs like shit unless you emulate it 🤷‍♂️
Only thing TOTK has going for it is the Garry's mod creation tools.
TotK was polarizing.  People who played Elden Ring felt like both of those zelda games were shadows of Elden Ring, the durability is hated by many, I know several people who hated sticking junk on their weapons so much they never got far enough in the game to get cool looking attachments.

Baldur's Gate hasn't been out long enough to judge, but the initial reaction is overwhelmingly positive.  It's got one of the highest concurrent player counts on steam of all time.  TotK is top three, but unless there are some serious issues in BG3 come late game, I don't see anything else competing for GotY.
Ttteeeeeechhhiiically Lord Voldermort wasn’t killed that night
    Ttteeeeeechhhiiically Lord Voldemort split his soul that night, instead
        Ttteeeeeechhhiiically Petter Pettigrew got Voldemort's soul split that night
        Ttteeeeeechhhiiically you shouldn't say his name.
            Ttteeeeeechhhiiically I can say Peter Pettigrew's name whenever I like
...through the protection given to Harry by his mother.
Meh, OOTP showed just how un-ready harry n the DA were for the tasks/duties to come. If it wasn't for dumbldore turning up in the ministry, HP would have died in book 5.

>Yeah the baby thing was me kinda being dumb though

Oh, I know, as was I.
Always the same stockholders.
Meme sites were absolutely filled with stuff from Zelda. The vehicle building system is crazy.
Nintendo shot themselves in the foot by not making it possible to share builds. I think that and only that would have kept the conversation. But truth be told from my experiences people talked about the game for no as long as they’ve talked about botw, at least my vivid memories in 2017/2018. Years later and you saw people gushing botw, but what’s their to gush about in totk? The devices really cool but they’ll mostly never have a long lasting impact on you as compared to an entirely huge new world. And no being able to share creations? Not being able to build huge enough devices without the frames tanking or materials despawning because of the switch’s low power? Forget about it. Even if most people enjoyed their time with the game what’s there to talk about
    BOTW in itself was kind of fresh when it comes to open world games. Even if it had flaws, it tried to go in a direction many open world games gave up on. That in itself would spark more discussions even after its release. The impact it could have on future games across the industry, wether it should continue in this direction or go back to old school Zelda, etc. 

TOTK doesnt do anything new. It just takes BOTW and adds some things on top. But nothing that will change the direction of the industry or anything like that. Theres nothing really to talk about other than “check out this build”. 

It also helps that at release BOTW was the only game on Switch worth buying the thing for released in a year that wasnt half as stacked as this year. People would want to talk more about it and atleast share positive experiences because they just spent like 300-400 just to play BOTW.
I havent seen like anything aside of like 2 vids of people building mechs the game is just overrated
    Eh I still get a ton of TikTok’s about people’s builds.

But I think it’s just the algorithm feeding me those videos because I watch Nintendo-related content.
        I dont own a switch and I could not get away from botw content for a year after it launched. I've seen a few of the new one but not even close to comparable.
    And you can’t even build big enough and cool enough things without the switch tanking fps or just despawning devices if you go to far away💀
That's just the algorithm
I agree with you. Sorry you got downvoted by rabid Nintendo fanboys
    Thanks !

I actually love zelda games usually.
Exactly. I played BotW expecting some grand open world and was like… this is it? I paid $60 for this?
And honestly most of what I heard about Jedi Survivor during that week was the performance issues, not how good of a sequel it is.
    Jedi survivor is ez goty so far not even close
Maybe im just plugged into the right circles. I love that game
    The game (gameplay, story, visuals) was fantastic. Severely let down by performance issues though which was a major shame.
        I tried playing it at launch but the performance issues were really really bad, have they been fixed yet?
            Not when I last played (PS5, around a month ago)
Really? I heard quite a bit how it was an amazing sequel and after playing it I agree. 

I know there’s performance issues but I didn’t experience them on Xbox. I’ve heard it’s a lot worse on PC though.
I'd say for as long as I've been into the 'gaming sphere' (from 2010 onwards, before that I was really young and mainly playing Nintendo games), 2010, 2011, 2013, 2017, 2018 and 2023 have been the primary standout years
    See I got into gaming about a decade before you so seeing a list of best years without 2001, 2004 and 2007 is crazy to me.
Hifi Rush wouod literary deserve it. This game is so good in every thinkable way. The humor the fighting, the world, the artstyle, the characters, everything was executed almost perfectly.
    Easily the best game released this year.
