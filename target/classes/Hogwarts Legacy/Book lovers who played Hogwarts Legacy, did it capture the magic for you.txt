[[Book lovers who played Hogwarts Legacy, did it capture the magic for you]]


I'm sure this has been asked here before, so forgive me. But Hogwarts Legacy is on sale and I've been thinking about picking it up. However, I've heard some middling things about it. I wanted to ask the opinion of serious Harry Potter book fans.

Does Hogwarts Legacy capture the fantasy we all had of going to Hogwarts? Exploring the castle, finding secret passages, dining in the Great Hall and sleeping in the common rooms? Is there anything in particular that really impressed or disappointed you? Does it do a good job capturing the feel of the Wizarding World and Hogwarts, or it more just "Good-but-not-really-great-Western-RPG"?

Thanks a bunch.


For Hogwarts and Gringotts, absolutely. These locations are wonderful. The game is worth playing just to experience these locations, and, in my opinion, worth buying to have permanent access to them. Hogwarts is one of the most visually rapturous game locations I've seen in my life, taking its place alongside 1998's Spyro the Dragon and Bioshock. Spellcasting is fun, and the little puzzles around Hogwarts make it feel properly magical and complicated.

That said, the story is lacking, and the game's mechanics are nearly always at odds with player agency and the story. You have to steal everything that isn't nailed down to level up your character and acquire new items. You'll kill countless "poachers" for capturing magical creatures, then capture the creatures yourself. It's a mess. But, if you can look beyond that, the game is a fun time.
    This. Music is there. Creatures are there. The castle is great, flying is fun. If you need the magical world tickle, get this game. The campaign is fun enough and gives further lore into the race wars and old magic.
    TBF, you aren't capturing the magical creatures to kill them like the poachers. You're doing it to care for them and breed them. (And you're free as a player to justify that however you want).
        Or collect them to sell them in Hogsmeade :)
            To poachers
        Lol I just sell them what thr shop keep clames to do with them us her business
        So you aren’t there to take advantage of them and breed them, just to ‘care’ for them and breed them. Gotttt it. One of the things with the game I find odd
            To be fair, you rescue them from a hazardous forest, where too many respawning poachers try to capture them, and then release them into a seemingly endless magical sanctuary, where nothing can really harm them.

Except for some greedy school kid, harvesting some feathers, in exchange for food and groom. Could be worse I guess
            The game pretty clearly shows the poachers skinning beasts for their pelts, killing them for other magical properties of their body parts, and/or using the beasts in fighting rings (like dragons).

So I do think the implementation / idea of the player character going around “capturing” beasts is a bit weird, but’s it’s completely different to what the poachers are doing to them.
            You need them for resources to upgrade other then that you could just sell them and buy what you need
    Yeah. This game had limited features but for a first attempt, it was really good. 

I hope the second game will be better. Really looking forward to Quidditch and improved broom flying controls.
        Its a good start and now that the fan service is out of the way maybe we can get more of an adult wizard game less safe.
        Is a second game confirmed?
            No. But I'd imagine this game will get a second one. 

The reception and sales were too good.
                How would they do a second game? Just keep the exact same map?
                    They could do it further in the future/past and change the surrounding grounds based on that. The castle layout would mostly stay the same but entirely new puzzles.
                        Aka the Tears of the Kingdom approach.
                            Essentially, yes.
                        Some have mentioned the possibility of placing the sequel alongside either the Marauders, 1st Wizarding War, or HP timelines, and having the player's story occur simultaneously, witnessing key moments from a new/different perspective. I like this idea.
                    Dawg the map of  hogwarts is alive and always changing so yeah
                    I can see them changing the setting ala GTA. 

If not they can always set the story in a different time era.
            Yes, but no. They announced a multiplayer [Quidditch game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter:_Quidditch_Champions) in 2023 (which is probably why Quidditch wasn't included in Legacy). 

"The player controls a character that holds a specific position in Quidditch and engages in broomstick adventures and competitive multiplayer modes."

"The game's visual style is distinct from ... *Hogwarts Legacy*, as it endeavors to have a more stylized and cartoon-like appearance. ... the game is not a direct adaptation of the books or films. The developers strive to maintain the authenticity of J. K. Rowling's original vision while also introducing innovative elements that allow fans to explore the world of magic"
        Broom controls were a little janky, for sure. I'm actually glad that they didn't put Quidditch in the game, because those controls would have made it a real fustercluck. Looking forward to DLC/sequel though, for this and other reasons.
    Spyro the dragon was such a lovely game when I was a kid. I'm going to dig out my disk and PS3(which should run PS1 disks if memory serves me right) to see if it still works.
        It’s on Nintendo switch, as well!
            Only the reignited trilogy, which is to the original what Disney live-action remakes are to their animated counterparts. To anyone who likes the reignited trilogy, good for you, but you clearly like Spyro for completely different reasons than I do. For me, the remake holds literally none of the magic the original (my favorite game of all time) did for me.
            That's good to know, I have one and it's not sitting in a box somewhere so it's even better!
    Ah but you see, we have to catch them so they don’t get caught!
    My mouth is now devoid of words, you took them.
    !redditgalleon for not only being 100% on point with the review, but also for bringing the Spyro reference.
        You have given u/Cute-Meet6982 a Reddit Galleon.

I am a bot. See [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/jnbo49/hi_i_created_the_bot_youve_been_using_to_give/) to learn how to use me.
exploring the castle is fun for sure. the classes left a lot to be desired in my opinion. definitely worth buying at a sale price.
It’s absolutely, absolutely worth it at $30 on steam’s sale rn. I spent like 30 hours just exploring everything before I even started playing the story seriously lol. It was a ton of fun—really worth it, especially if it’s on sale. I’ve played through three times starting in a different house each time. There’s a special quest that changes depending on which house you’re in too. My favorite thing to do is to turn off the mini map and just explore Hogwarts and hogsmead. The enemies are a little repetitive, but that’s not even that big a deal imo because the exploration is so much fun
    A dollar per hour of entertainment, and that's before you started the story? I've been on the edge, so thanks for selling it to me, I'll pull the trigger tomorrow!

So often people have sticker shock about games, and my move is to ask, will this keep me busy for at least five hours, and is this amount of money more or less than what I would spend at a bar over five hours... games win pretty much all the time!
    The beginning of the game when you are limited to Hogwarts and Hogsmeade is fantastic. They did a great job designing the castle and the attention to detail is awesome. You can spend a good few dozen hours wandering around and doing the initial quests and side quests. As soon soon as you leave those areas, and have to venture outside, the game goes to shit. The rpg aspects are nonexistent and the story is poor. There is also zero replay value. That being said I think I got my moneys worth at $60 so half off will be well worth it.
        Yeah, most of the other villages and explorable areas feel a bit repetetive. Rather than have such a large map to explore, i would have preferred they let us go to diagon alley instead, as it would feel more lived in and populated, like hogsmeade.
    Can you get away with just running around exploring hogwarts without doing the main quest? 

Once they announced the game I was pretty pissed it was another good v evil battle story. 

Just let me run around hogwarts and fuck around, HP Sorcerers Stone PC style.
        Yes and no. Legacy is the first game I've played in decades for reference. You can wander around almost endlessly it seems and do little puzzles or collect things. But in order to do more puzzles and collect more things while exploring is to learn spells and level up. So you don't have to follow the story per se but you can only do so much quality exploring without it. I've been playing for a week or so and I've only explored like 10% of the game even without a ton of story work. My one complaint is that it's not very clear what the objective is for the current task or battle is. I'm doing a lot of guessing and googling to even know wtf I'm doing half the time.
For me, yes. The most hours I’ve ever spent in one game. I adored it. The biggest negative for me was so far the plot and side quests are the same for my second go around with a different house. I should have expected that! But I did find it disappointing. I will also say the journey was by far my favorite part of- the plot felt interesting, but the actual ending felt a little rushed and the choices were kinda meh. Just running around and collecting things, solving puzzles, fighting spiders - I loved all that! I also enjoyed that each “friend” character had ongoing quests with real plot, not necessarily unimportant fluff. It felt like I wanted to find out more for the most part. I give the game a 9.75/10
Personally I’ve loved it and I’m well over 70 hours in. But I understand how it’s not everyone’s cup of tea - really comes down to what you like in games. But if you want, you could easily spend days exploring the castle and still not see everything
    Not really.. you can explore the entire castle in a couple hours.
        If you can remember all the hallways and stairwells you’ve already been down lol
100% yes. The recreation of Hogwarts is breathtaking.
Game is overall really fun. First half much more magical and inventive, but I think the second half feels more rushed and loses a bit of the magic to me. Still very worth it at the current price, tho!
100 percent
I throughly enjoyed playing it and it was great to see the HP world come to life. It’s a really beautiful game and overall very fun. Even just flying around the map is satisfying. I believe it’s on sale right now, at least for the PS5, at a really great price.

All that said, there’s definitely a lot of room for improvement with HL2. You as the player lack true agency, and enemies can be really repetitive. Some of the tasks and activities lack purpose in the end, so I hope they improve upon those in HL2.
Nah, books were about living in the castle, and I mean literally living in it. From waking up to food to evening to nights, books were all about that. 

Game is just a game with no emphasis on daily routine. The character could go away from the castle for days without someone noticing that he is gone. It didn't capture living in the castle.
    Idk why people expected a game like this. It was always going to be a standard AAA open world game. 

Do any games really exist like you describe?  Something like that would be awesome for someone who really wants to get immersed in that kind of experience, but absolutely atrocious for everyone else. By default, that style of game would require so many repetitive experiences to simulate day to day living
        To be fair, if they had removed the day/night cycle and forced you to use your bed at times to advance the story (by starting a new day), have classes be done in order rather than multiple available you can pick, than it'd be doable that way and sorta work. 

They just chose to go more open world and give more freedom. It works as is, though I do wish they'd provided more tools to RP the other way (like letting us sleep in our bed)
        Bully: hands down
        Games like Bully and the Persona series absolutely did pull off simulating day to day school life and still making it fun. It can be done!
It laid the foundation for an exceptional game but it didn't reach that potential. The story was overall, uninspired, being completely overshadowed by a side quest. The Castle and Hogsmeade are great, unfortunately, the countryside is where you'll be spending a lot of time and it's frankly too big and filled with activities that can be quite uninteresting and repetitive. The combat is overall pretty fun and I can't think of any flaws with it off the top of my head.

Overall, it's a good game. One I'm on my third playthrough of. I'd recommend it on sale. However, if what you're looking for is a Hogwarts Student Simulator with classes, secrets, and that sort of thing, you may have more fun with some of the old movie tie-in games.
Visually, yes.

Mechanically, no. It is not a Hogwarts simulator. The classes you attend are limited to those which feed into the main story. You can't sleep in the dorms. Etc.
I would recommend it for $30. It's great if you want to wonder around Hogwarts for a while and just explore the world. I do agree with most others that the story and most the characters are pretty forgettable, and I didn't bother finishing the main questline. But the combat is pretty fun, and there's enough to do to be worth $30 imo.

Edit: However, it's not really an RPG at all imo. Outside of being able to create your character and having a different common room depending on the house you pick, everyone basically has the same experience.  You can visit the Great Hall but you can't really eat there, you don't really have a need to go to your common room after a certain point unless you want to, and your choices don't really effect the plot at all. I don't mean to say it's bad game per se, but if you are expecting it to be an RPG game you'll probably be disappointed.
    They spent so much damn time on the clothes and the selection ended up being both gigantic and insubstantial at the same time. I’d much rather have fewer options that I could color as I like than three dozen variations on blazer and waistcoat uniforms.

I wish they gave us the Ashwinder/Poacher uniforms as well. They already built the assets for the enemies and they looked so damn cool.
Yes! Loved it and I completed every bit. And it was the gateway for me for other games. I looked through my husbands games and played Witcher 3 next. And I just finished Assassins Creed Odyssey.
    It was totally a gateway game for me as well! I just played Jedi: Fallen Order and Jedi: Survivor and loved them!
Did it capture the magic? Yes and no. Hogwarts, Hogsmeade, flying, that's all done very well. But:

>dining in the Great Hall and sleeping in the common rooms

You can't do that. I mean you can walk to these places, but that's it. Generally you won't feel like a student at Hogwarts. There are only a few classes. There are no house or common room related activities. You can't interact with anyone outside of quests.

Just trying to temper your expectations. Still easily worth it on sale though.
I just bought the game and it is AMAZING! The story is fun and the environments are absolutely stunning beyond what I could have imagined. I've only been playing for like 10 hours so far but it's amazing.

Edit: I'm playing on 4K with a 3070, so that probably helps a little.
Yes and no. I wish the game focused more on the castle but instead, you spend most the game outside in the surrounding areas.
No. Not for me. You barely do anything school related. Instead, the game makes up a bunch of non Canon things surrounding Hogwarts. 
I did have some fun playing the game, but mostly, the story was undercooked, characters were 2 dimensional, and the gameplay was frustrating. 

Honestly cannot recommend it unless you are getting serious fomo.
Too many fucking globes.

Why was there a million globes? It's the same as Elder's scrolls weird obsession with giant mushrooms. I get they needed to fill the rooms with stuff. 

Other than that, loved it.
    I spin every globe I see
Yes and no - it nailed Hogwarts, hogsmeade, and the forbidden forest, but I felt like it spent way too much time away from the castle. I think I would have preferred a smaller, richer map focusing on locations from the books.

Not saying I didn't have fun, though - I played the game for 80 hours and got 100% completion on the field guide. It got to the point where I was oneshotting every enemy.
Yes, it did. Rest of the game is pretty average, but Hogwarts itself and the combat to an extent is very engrossing. 

Best part is finding all the deep cuts and funny lil references they added from the books, like portraits, statues, secret areas and passages, among other great little nods and references.
I don’t have the game but we’ve watched some YouTube videos of game play and it looks awesome. You get to make your character and pick your house etc. and fly on a broom. Sounds magical to me! The only less positive things I’ve heard is the challenges or story lines could be better. I am a book lover and do not have a way to play the game (we certainly aren’t buying a PlayStation just for one game) but man….if I could, I would love to have that game.
    I actually did that myself for one game! Have you considered going to a pawn shop? You'll probably be able to find a used system that works perfectly well, and when you're done with the game, you can take it back to them for maybe $50 less than what you paid for it. And of course you have to pay for the game itself. That might sound like a lot, but lots of games take many dozens of hours to finish. And everything's digital nowadays, so if you ever buy the system "for real," the game will be available on your account.

It wasn't for Harry Potter. It was for a Persona game. Off-topic, but if you have any interest in a story about high school kids entering a magical world, learning fantastic abilities, and accomplishing incredible things while still going to school, I absolutely cannot recommend Persona 5 (Royal) highly enough.
        This is good tips. Didn’t think of a pawn shop. But we could buy an older or used PlayStation or Xbox maybe 🤔. The Persona game sounds good. I’m not a gamer at all though. Hogwarts Legacy really has me considering wanting to play a game for the first time!
            Like most everything else in life, there's a whole lot of obnoxious garbage, but there's also some really good and worthwhile stuff. There's some really beautiful games out there.

And yeah, I recommend doing exactly that. You don't have to worry about opening a bunch of boxes and thinking about how you might get rid of the thing if you don't like it. You can go to a pawn shop, grab the thing and take it home, and plug it in. Done. Worst case scenario, you fiddle with it for 30 minutes, and decide it really isn't for you. You take it right back and you've spent $100 or so. Not the end of the world.
Exploration wise? Sure! Hogsmeade shops were magical, as well as the castle. Echoing others that the story wasn’t very good and gameplay wise felt soulless without the multiplayer service. I do love the art design and multiplayer more in the free to play mobile game, HP Magic Awakened. The classes are done better there and they also have a dueling club. 

Hogwarts Legacy was enjoyable the first time around, but to me, doesn’t have the replay factor once you’ve beaten and almost complete the game (I think I stopped at like 97% completion on the other goals in the game outside the story).
It does it enough to be worth it for me. It’s very true to the books and movies as far as spells, beasts, lore, etc.
I spent 70€ on it for the deluxe edition just before launch and I have around 120 hours on it so far…. Definitely worth it!
The art and the castle were great, and I actually liked exploring the areas around the castle as well. But I quit playing the game reasonably early on because the gameplay just wasn't interesting or challenging enough. 

Every quest felt like a tutorial to unlock some new spell or ability, even 8 or 10 hours into the game. It's an open world game: I wish it had allowed me to unlock new abilities that interested me as I explored that open world and leveled up, rather than forcing me to do a set quest chain.
Fuck yeah!
Collectibles were a slough to get through and having to play as all four houses to get the platinum trophy was exhausting and pointless. 

But the first playthrough, the story and combat was everything I was looking for. They did an outstanding job and I couldn’t have been happier.
I believe any fan can get some beautiful experience out of the game, yes magic was had just in the first 20 minutes and the first hour had me hooked. For book fans there are extras both in the story as well as the exploration of the castle.
I was given the Hogwarts Legacy for the switch for my birthday and I would not recommend it for the switch at least.   

It’s a game not designed for the switch. The graphics are terrible is the main one and there are also multiple bugs.    

There are long load times where you will be staring at the load screen for minutes. There was a quest where you explored Hogsmeade and every time you entered or exited a shop, you got a load screen. I spent more time waiting for things to load then actually exploring. 
  
It takes you out of the magic of it when you had to wait 5 minutes for something to load. Getting it for the PC or another game console would be better.
You mean does it show the glaring lack of care for students and purposefully puts them in danger just like the Harry Potter series? Yes lol

Kidding (somewhat) I would say no honestly.  You don't really feel like a student at all and interactions with people fall very very flat.  No personality outside the main characters.  It feels like they spent 95% on the map which is absolutely stunning and 5% on literally every other aspect of a video game
    I absolutely agree, I was very disappointed with the game. Breathtaking, sure, but I hated every interaction, side-character, collectable. Never attempted to finish it.
Looking forward to some insight as well I saw it in the steam winter sale 🤔
I just bought it and honestly am impressed with the depression of HP vs Wizarding World, if that makes sense. There are nods to things readers/movie folks would know, but does a good job infusing new world building and history. I'm currently stuck pretty early game at dueling, lol.
More than I could have ever hoped for.
I have 90+ hours in the game so felt like I could add my 2 cents in here

I think any Harry Potter fan who also enjoys gaming would love it. There’s a lot to do, many quests and challenges and lots to explore. If I had 1 complaint then I’d say I wish there were more challenges to do inside the school itself and not just in the whole world map but I was still able to spend a lot of time inside of hogwarts and am really really hoping they do a second game
I really enjoyed it! I’m not a gamer at all so I had a steep learning curve but it was fun doing something new. I loved exploring the castle and flying around the absolutely gorgeous landscape. I am not very competitive so by the time I was ready to beat it I was ready to be done. But if you like video games and HP I would say definitely worth it!
Yes. It is incredible. They took care to add so many details from the books. I also loved getting to explore the towns and highlands around the castle. I enjoyed Side Quests more than the main story. Though I did enjoy the main story
I bought it on Black Friday sale and have been having so much fun doing the quests and exploring the world. It looks and feels really magical. 

I'm taking the main quests really slow so that I can make it last longer, so I just hit Christmas in the game when we got Christmas. It was so fun! 

I don't know why people complain about the countryside. I love exploring it as much as Hogwarts. The small hamlets that are everywhere are so cute and there's plenty of side quests to be done on the countryside. 

I also love the idea of rescuing the endangered wildlife from poachers (and killing the poachers) as I hate poaching in RL, too. I just did the quest for rescuing a phoenix. I'd been dying to get that quests for a long time, so it was very satisfying to complete it.

I absolutely recommend the game for any fan. I've had the feeling of finally being at Hogwarts since I started playing.
ABSOLUTELY. Is it a great RPG? No, but if you aren’t a regular gamer like I am, then that shouldn’t be a problem. There are much better RPGs. I absolutely LOVE to just explore though. It’s so wonderful getting lost in my favorite world.
I adore this game. So much so that I bought 3 versions of it for 3 different game systems lol.

I've been playing it very frequently since March and I still am obsessed with it.
Yes
Yes
Currently playing (31hrs completed). The game is really captures a sense of magic about everything. Vast area to explore, the castle itself is really big. Combat mechanics is good with different spells. May not the greatest game but a solid 8/10 from me!
Absolutely worth it for the scenery alone, they really put a lot of effort into it. 

It’s not a very deep RPG if that’s what you’re looking for, but as a HP fan, I really enjoyed it. 

About 50 hours to compete the story, but many more if you want to fully explore and take everything in.
Yes.

It's an average game by any gaming standard. But it's an amazing Harry Potter experience. The castle is absolutely magical.
Yes! I’m always amazed with the graphics and how great they creators kept to the authenticity of it! Plus being able to customize your character is a plus! Highly recommend!
i’m about 2 hours into play time, and i just made it into hogsmeade. the detail on everything is incredible IMO, and i’m playing it on the switch. hogsmeade is so detailed, the castle is super detailed, the level of interaction/exploration with everything (even walking off the path you can do stuff) is so much more than i expected (maybe bc i played through lego harry potter, idk). i’m enjoying it thoroughly
Yes. Yes it does.
The environment (Hogwarts, the grounds, Hogsmead, etc) was absolutely stunning, full of magic - it more than visualised the books for me, and was immersive. I spent a lot of time slowly wandering around taking it all in. Problem is the collecting becomes laborious as he'll, the open world around hogwarts etc being too large and empty of things to do aside a thousand Merlin Trials to add like one or two inventory slots. Once the thrill of the first couple hours was over, it got grindy and monotonous real quick. 

The combat is a lot of fun, and really engages you with spell work and combinations.

Outfits are brilliantly designed, loads of variety, though the random colour drop for loot can be annoying as it's so varied between play through and completely random. So for EG, I got a lot of red tones and school robes when playing as a Hufflepuff, barely any yellow, and when I did play as a Gryffindor, I found a tonne of designs I wanted for my previous character, so that was a little annoying. But the robes sway so beautifully and the fabrics and colours are stunningly designed. 

The creator is so limited, and no face looks like a teenager, more like celebrity 25 year old play acting teenagers in a vampire Netflix show or something. Glossy, too symmetrical, all pretty much with high cheekbones, perfect pointy chins, straight noses. There's no sliders, just presets, and a few different hair styles. 

The story is shit. The end makes no sense, barely any lore points are even explained properly. The characters have next to no personality, the voice acting is terrible, and everyone sounds like they belong in a pepper pig episode. It's cringe worthy listening to anyone speak. Hogwarts is completely empty of students, too, and the npcs don't move or change their set dialogue through the entire game, so by the final chapters, that one whiny kid is still stood in ravenclaw tower chirping that they can't *believe* you found that picture (in act 1.) So, though hogwarts is pretty, it's stagnant and lacking in life. 

Overall opinion: if you wanna play dress up, collect stuff, and pretty environment's alone are enough to hold your attention the whole game, sure, it's worth it. If you want a decent story, choices, or to be *apart* of the wizarding world like the game was (wrongly) advertised, then don't waste your time. As a HP book fan since age 9, I was mortified by the experience - it's the only game I've ever pre ordered, and I never will again, nor will I likely ever play the thing again.
>"Good-but-not-really-great-Western-RPG"?

The game is no 10/10 masterpiece, but that matters only to someone who isn't a Harry Potter fan.

If you are a fan of the books, this game is a magical delight. 

This rendition of Hogwarts is absolutely monumental. Combat is enjoyable, spells are fun to cast. Side-quests and magical beasts are nice distractions. Hogsmeade is a treat. The rest of the world feels a little underwhelming compared to these 2 areas, but it's still incredibly fun to explore.

This is undoubtedly the best Harry Potter universe game created till date, and is a must-play if you're a fan of the series. 

Lastly, if you ever feel bad about hurting people in the game, just remember to blame it all on Ranrok.
Currently playing. Absolutely does. Just when I thought I explored most of the castle, I discover something new. Almost don’t even want to go to Hogsmede or explore the world map. Story isn’t too bad for me but it’s a fun play!
Bought it earlier this year and enjoyed until I started reading tips online and “Things I wish I knew when I first started.” I lost interest under the pressure of doing things people recommended online rather than just playing the game for fun. 

By writing this I’ve convinced myself to go back to the game and play normally, so thank you! 😃 Have fun with it!
Story is 3/5, but the open ended exploration and game environment is amazing 10/5. Highly recommend the game if it's on sale, especially if you want to explore and wander around free roaming in the game.
First time exploring Hogwarts was legit emotional for me. It's huge, it's gorgeous, it's filled with book accurate details. And I keep getting lost even after playing 70+ hours. That in itself is worth getting it. Even before you get out of the castle.
Exploring the castle for sure. The world around it a bit less but still fun if you ask me. The Hogwarts Castle itself is to me, the most detailed and best game location in any game ever.
it’s worth it for exploring the castle alone. It’s been a long time that I felt like a child just being in awe of playing a videogame. A quite literally magical experience. The story and world outside of it is forgettable.
For the nostalgic feeling, capturing the magic of the castle and Hogsmeade etc, absolutely worth it especially on sale. Just to manage your expectations, you'll be able to go into the forms/common room and go to the great hall, but for some strange reason you're not able to sit anywhere. However you are able to explore freely and fly around and into the open courtyards, the castle, area around it and Hogsmeade all look amazing and there's soooo much to explore, so many little secrets and references and things to do in Hogwarts. As a book lover it made me tear up a bit and I'm still playing it until today simply for the nostalgic reason.

Fly around Hogwarts during sunrise or sunset. Dream come true!
For the most part, absolutely, and I adored it. However, it was clear the devs wanted a lot more for it but they couldn't get to everything with time constraints and Rowling's controversies making so many of the designers not want to work on it anymore. I loved it but I mourn for what it could have been.
If you can afford it I recommend picking up hogwarts legacy. The castle is excellent and it’s enjoyable to explore the surrounding areas. Just flying over the lake and the castle grounds is very therapeutic. 

The story and gameplays leaves a lot to desire and wish they went in a different direction (bully hogwarts edition?) but it’s still an enjoyable experiment. It’s a game I’m glad I’ve bought (and I I bought it at full price on release) but I’m not dying to remake and wouldn’t suggest to a none fan to buy.
Gameplay and atmosphere, yes. Story, no
Absolutely get the game! It's such a treat getting a version of hogwarts you can explore yourself! It was SO much fun!!!! 
Even if you don't care for the games story (I liked it tbh) I think it's definitely worth its sale price. I got it on release and don't regret a thing!
Personally, no. And I think 50% off is still a bit too overprized, specially bc it has Denuvo.  
But, as a book fan, it has many flaws:  
1) while the story is acceptably compelling, it doesn't make a lot of sense by the books' rules. To begin with, you start in 5th year; then, there are classes that feel as no classes at all.  
2) the magic: well, maybe understandable, but it's all pulled from the movies. Neither the selected spell pool nor the way to learn and use some of them make any sense nor follow the books.  
3) Hogwarts. Yes, it's by far the greatest adaptation made so far but it also has important flaws: to begin with, there are no secret passageways; second, they completely invented a new system they called Floo which ends up having you asking just why.  
Overall, it didn't really impressed me as much (as book reader). Aside from the beautiful setting and certain detail such as being able to explore all the common rooms (beautifully imagined and detailed) there were just too many changes to feel really ok.
Yes it did
The world was great, the story dull. So, no in my case.
Yes
YES

Best Potterverse game ever

Best game of the year 2023
I paid $60 and thought it well worth it. I ADORE the books but am not a huge gamer; it makes me feel like I’ve entered into the books and i absolutely love it! Some of the comments here speak to game play that I didn’t really think about bc I’m so inexperienced at games. I just know I had a lot of fun playing it as long time major book fan and feel really sad I’ve almost finished it (which took a while, I found the main story a good length).
I think the world is amazing! There is so much to explore (both within Hogwarts and outside) and the visuals are breathtaking. If they had made it a social simulation game like Sims 4, there would have been nothing like it!
I think I'm about halfway through and playing it on Switch. The scenery is amazing and Hogsmead is a very cosy town. The castle is magical but feels cold in some places, there's a lot of students sat on the floor on bare stone which looks cold. The combat is fun once you get the hang of it. The flying was also good, although it might feel better to me as I remember how awful it was in the PS and CoS PS2 games.

The main problems with it are that the plot isn't great, the gear slots fill up too quickly and it's a pain to divert to somewhere you can sell things, often also needing to go to the room of Requirement to identify things first. I feel like my character gets used as a slave by the other students, there's a lot of side quests where students you've never spoken to ask you to do random small things for them. You can ask for payment but you feel like an ass doing it. I also don't like that there was no Hogwarts Express to get there and no explanation of why you start as a fifth year, although I'm hoping that comes up later in the game.
My partner got bored watching me play because I kept stopping to simply pan my screen and take in all the scenery. It definitely captured Hogwarts, hogsmead, and the Scottish highlands. I absolutely loved it. I actually teared up a bit when you get to fly the hippogriff for the first time.
It was fun to explore the castle for a few hours then I lost interest. The story didn’t interest me and I found the combat repetitive and boring. After I felt like I had seen a lot of the castle there wasn’t much reason outside of that to continue playing.
Not really. I mean, the game itself is beautiful, but the mechanics feel very limited. There's little possibilities to develop your character beyond the additional creation because there are barely any consequences until the very end (taking the mean options in sidequests won't affect your reputation or anything except "wah you're mean!" being said once and that's it) where you can do one or two decisions in total.

Also, there's very little to do role playing wise - barely any classes, you can't sit down or even sleep in your dorm, there's barely any dialogue in non-quest relevant NPCs, and the entire game feels like a tutorial by teaching you spells via the main quest and then being repetitive (you only learn Alohomora way late into the story and whatnot, but are led past countless locks to use it on before, so you need to wander back and use it on all of them).

Flying around the area is cool, but that's about it.
My wife gave me this for Christmas and I've been loving it!
The game is a great fan service but its just an "ok" RPG. I would not recommend it to someone thst dosent like Harry Potter.
Absolutely. I’m playing it now and I just keep saying out loud “I can’t believe they’ve done it!”
Yes. I'm not very far into the game, but I was sorted into Hufflepuff (my house), and when I left my dorm to enter the common room- I'm not kidding when I say that I just started crying. The castle, the grounds, the characters, they're wonderful. I felt like I was finally getting to \*experience\* Hogwarts for myself.
Yes, especially walking around Hogwarts.
Yes and no! I love video games (and the books ofc), but I had no experience with RPGs like Legacy, so in a way I’m glad this was my first experience bc if I had played something like Baldurs Gate or Skyrim before, I think I would have been disappointed with the story. It’s kind of weird we only have 25 or so spells in a game about magic.

I thought the attention to detail and all of the little things in the castle were really well done though. I love wandering around the castle, going to the classes, and doing all the random little side quests. It’s really fun don’t get me wrong, but I don’t think it’s at the same level as the other RPGs.

 I got the premium version at launch and I don’t think it was worth it. If it’s on sale or something, I would pick it up.
It’s worth it on sale. Just being able to walk through Hogwarts and see the details they included was very fun!
Definitely. The settings were gorgeous. Gameplay, voice acting, and story were a bit clunky and you can definitely tell it’s the studio’s first game, but it’s still pretty solid. Hopefully they refine things for the sequel that was confirmed recently.
Absolutely, it was like experiencing the books again. For me it goes; Books, audio books, Hogwarts Legacy. It was amazing to have a faithful visual representation of the wizzarding world. God knows we were robbed of it from the movies
Hogwarts Legacy did what it set out to do. Make me feel like I’m having an adventure at Hogwarts. I had a very good time with it, and it’s got some okay replay-ability. If Avalanche is really going to make a second one then I’ll say it’s a very good jumping off point into another game. As long as they took in all the feedback. 

It’s not at all going to win any awards but if you’re looking for a good time and not to critique it? Then yeah have a go.
Castle: 9/10, I always get lost and that the path is constantly recalculated doesn't help

Gameplay 4/10: It gets pretty repetitive and boring quite quickly...

Edit:

Goblins and especially Goblin Artefacts/Armor/Weapons: -6/10, goblins are supposed to be master metalworkers and craftsmen, the objects in the game look like orkish trash from a cheap WoW knock-off and not at all like any human would consider them to be absolutely masterpieces...
Very much so.  

It's beautiful.  The castle is expansive and fun.   I've been to Scotland twice now, and roaming around the world was incredibly nostalgic for me.  There's little easter eggs all over the place.    

You  don't actually eat in the great hall, nor do you sleep (like once on the first day, it black screens and you wake up there), but you do take a couple of classes, can brew potions, practice herbology, the Room of Requirement, magical beast care.  

It was a gateway RPG for me.  I think seasoned RPG players would find it a little basic in terms of play, but the Hogwarts and Scotland parts of it are just awesome regardless.  

I found the flying controls to b e horrible and had to download a mod to fly with my mouse not the keyboard (I'm on PC) to basically do it at all, but console might be better.  PC there is a mod, thankfully.
Yes it did
Honestly the magic of running around the castle etc. perfect, the missions did get a little dull after a while as they mostly felt like a lot of "run here and collect 10 of these". The adventure and exploration was amazing though
I enjoyed it and it is interesting to create your own character.  However, you have to rely heavily on your own imagination immersing your character into the Wizarding World.  I try to make my own story consisting of four characters admitted into Hogwarts into their fifth year and sorted into each house.  I had to pretend certain events and quests pertain to only one or two characters and just breeze through them with the others which can be a real chore.  I hope for improvements in the sequel and most especially events depending on your house.
Yeah it was amazing. Was the broom flying for me. Fucking love that broom.
I really enjoyed the exploration and puzzles. The spells are cool but I hate the “basic attack” because it’s too much like how the later movies treated wands like handguns. Gear feels like a pointless inclusion, I never actually felt my character getting stronger. Just either keeping up with or falling behind the leveling curve. The story is pretty lousy and to be perfectly frank, I hate how much casual murder is involved even if you’re not using Unforgivable Curses.
Yes absolutely!
I think so, I’ve spent provably an embarrassing amount of hours just walking around the school, trying to map out everything. The game play itself is fun, there’s lots off side quests and story lines to follow, but it’s also just very relaxing to explore, walk around ext. the school itself is exquisite and found myself smiling involuntarily because it kind of just felt like “home”.
I feel like it's basically a must play for anybody with even a passing interest in HP. It's not without flaws but it's a solid game that you will get a lot of joy out of.
Exploration wise- absolutely. Hogwarts and Hogsmeade is *incredibly* fun to explore and find all the little Easter eggs and stuff. 

Combat: I found it very fun and rewarding- absolutely one of the best parts of the game imo.

Plot: lack luster, not terrible but not all that great in my opinion- but the world itself made up for it for me

RPG elements - worst part about the game. It’s not *really* an RPG other than the upgraded spells. Your decisions don’t really matter unfortunately. There is no good/evil scale whatsoever. And there are 0 repercussions of using unforgivable curses (even directly in front of other people including professors). 

Overall if you love Harry Potter it’s *absolutely* worth the $30
That game is a masterpiece as far as I’m concerned. Hogwarts was incredibly captivating and getting a real idea of the castle layout was something I’ve always wanted to experience. Flying around the world was as magical as it gets. I’m excited for a DLC!
Really is worth it just to fly on a broom, design your wand and walk around Hogwarts...not to mention you get to customize the room of requirement as your own “HQ”. I like to smoke up a bit and just roam around the school grounds and fly around a bit, the story is meh but it looks stunning.
100% - it also works backwards and helps me better visualise Hogwarts and certainly Hogsmeade when I’m re-reading the books
Yes. I absolutely loved it.
Hogwarts Legacy is good, I enjoy it.  However I just bought the Switch game Harry Potter Lego years 1-4 + 5-7 and I can't get enough of it.  It's hilarious and fun to play.  They are both good in different ways
I wanted to like it so much but it just wasn't engaging for me. I played for a few hours and it felt more like a chore than a game.
The locations and magic - yes. Characters and story though… I didn’t finish he game cause of that. Too boring and tedious.
Yes.
It did and it didn’t. Hogwarts and Hogsmeade are incredibly detailed and fun to explore, and satisfactorily capture the magic of those two locations. Flying on a broomstick is also amazing! 

I was disappointed with the lack of classes (I was expecting I would try earning more grades as side quests), the potions element was a little half assed and also disappointing, and the story was meh.
Hogwarts is really well done in terms of visual appeal and exploration. They did their best to reconcile the film and book descriptions and pulled it off. Almost everything you might want to see in the castle can be found, minus things from the Harry Potter story that would be anachronistic. It does make you think differently about the books’ description, though. What the hell does “fifth-floor corridor mean with several towers and turrets? It makes Rowling sound like she’s writing about a big building rather than a castle. Hogsmeade is good also. The Highlands exterior is decent in the quest locations, but not much else. 

The game has an intro and then four periods of “trials.” The last two are super rushed and almost unfinished. The story more exciting. in the front half, certainly. The combat is decent enough for a first game, but the novelty wears off and it ends up being pretty shallow in its RPG characteristics. The play styles don’t end up being that different from each other when it comes down to it. 

The game has the most basic sci-fi/fantasy plot you could imagine. It’s a big bad ancient magical force McGuffin that you have to keep out of the wrong hands. It’s by far the worst part of the game.

This is an adventure game, not a Hogwarts student simulator. The exploration and will satisfy your Harry Potter itch enough, I think. The art and visuals are fantastic.  But the gameplay and plot might be disappointing to you.
Here's the way I looked at it before buying it. At the BARE MINIMUM, you're paying for a Hogwarts castle simulator. To me that alone was worth it. Anything after that was just extra. That being said, the key mark moments of the Harry Potter universe were pretty magical in the game. I'd say it captures some of the whimsy that the first couple movies depict from the books. Definitely worth it if you can catch it on sale, I'd even say it's worth full price.
I personally feel like it lacks the darkness that is so innate with Hogwarts, the secrets and the tension of it all. Plot, characters and general attitude is quite lacking. Aside from that, to be able to wonder around the castle is pretty neat. All in all, this definitely feels like they know what they were doing, shipped a very well crafted beta version of what could've been in order to test the waters and make it financially more profitable. If the second one delivers on the plot, characters and general tone, it will be what most of us dreamed of since kids.  

Hopefully the next game builds on this good foundation.
Late to this party. Just got the game maybe 3 weeks ago and progressed quite a bit. 

Its fun to explore the castle. It seems smaller than it would be if Hogwarts were a real place, but it feels massive in the game. Its super complex, theres no way I can get familiar with it unless I just walk around for hours on end. Its fun to explore the castle. Some stuff is similar to what its like in the movies, other stuff seems strange. Overall, the castle design is fun.

Theres some references to existing characters from the books, like a professor Weasley. But overall, it feels very disconnected from the HP world in the books. Thats OK.

It feels like a Harry Potter inspired universe more than it feels like the Harry potter world to me. It kinda feels like its as if I was going to Hogwarts sometime well after the events of the HP series maybe though.

Overall its a great game and if you love HP you will probably like it.
Bought it on Steam sale recently, and yes, it really does. A few issues, perhaps, but DLC and/or the sequel will likely take care of those.
This. Music is there. Creatures are there. The castle is great, flying is fun. If you need the magical world tickle, get this game. The campaign is fun enough and gives further lore into the race wars and old magic.
TBF, you aren't capturing the magical creatures to kill them like the poachers. You're doing it to care for them and breed them. (And you're free as a player to justify that however you want).
    Or collect them to sell them in Hogsmeade :)
        To poachers
    Lol I just sell them what thr shop keep clames to do with them us her business
    So you aren’t there to take advantage of them and breed them, just to ‘care’ for them and breed them. Gotttt it. One of the things with the game I find odd
        To be fair, you rescue them from a hazardous forest, where too many respawning poachers try to capture them, and then release them into a seemingly endless magical sanctuary, where nothing can really harm them.

Except for some greedy school kid, harvesting some feathers, in exchange for food and groom. Could be worse I guess
        The game pretty clearly shows the poachers skinning beasts for their pelts, killing them for other magical properties of their body parts, and/or using the beasts in fighting rings (like dragons).

So I do think the implementation / idea of the player character going around “capturing” beasts is a bit weird, but’s it’s completely different to what the poachers are doing to them.
        You need them for resources to upgrade other then that you could just sell them and buy what you need
Yeah. This game had limited features but for a first attempt, it was really good. 

I hope the second game will be better. Really looking forward to Quidditch and improved broom flying controls.
    Its a good start and now that the fan service is out of the way maybe we can get more of an adult wizard game less safe.
    Is a second game confirmed?
        No. But I'd imagine this game will get a second one. 

The reception and sales were too good.
            How would they do a second game? Just keep the exact same map?
                They could do it further in the future/past and change the surrounding grounds based on that. The castle layout would mostly stay the same but entirely new puzzles.
                    Aka the Tears of the Kingdom approach.
                        Essentially, yes.
                    Some have mentioned the possibility of placing the sequel alongside either the Marauders, 1st Wizarding War, or HP timelines, and having the player's story occur simultaneously, witnessing key moments from a new/different perspective. I like this idea.
                Dawg the map of  hogwarts is alive and always changing so yeah
                I can see them changing the setting ala GTA. 

If not they can always set the story in a different time era.
        Yes, but no. They announced a multiplayer [Quidditch game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter:_Quidditch_Champions) in 2023 (which is probably why Quidditch wasn't included in Legacy). 

"The player controls a character that holds a specific position in Quidditch and engages in broomstick adventures and competitive multiplayer modes."

"The game's visual style is distinct from ... *Hogwarts Legacy*, as it endeavors to have a more stylized and cartoon-like appearance. ... the game is not a direct adaptation of the books or films. The developers strive to maintain the authenticity of J. K. Rowling's original vision while also introducing innovative elements that allow fans to explore the world of magic"
    Broom controls were a little janky, for sure. I'm actually glad that they didn't put Quidditch in the game, because those controls would have made it a real fustercluck. Looking forward to DLC/sequel though, for this and other reasons.
Spyro the dragon was such a lovely game when I was a kid. I'm going to dig out my disk and PS3(which should run PS1 disks if memory serves me right) to see if it still works.
    It’s on Nintendo switch, as well!
        Only the reignited trilogy, which is to the original what Disney live-action remakes are to their animated counterparts. To anyone who likes the reignited trilogy, good for you, but you clearly like Spyro for completely different reasons than I do. For me, the remake holds literally none of the magic the original (my favorite game of all time) did for me.
        That's good to know, I have one and it's not sitting in a box somewhere so it's even better!
Ah but you see, we have to catch them so they don’t get caught!
My mouth is now devoid of words, you took them.
!redditgalleon for not only being 100% on point with the review, but also for bringing the Spyro reference.

A dollar per hour of entertainment, and that's before you started the story? I've been on the edge, so thanks for selling it to me, I'll pull the trigger tomorrow!

So often people have sticker shock about games, and my move is to ask, will this keep me busy for at least five hours, and is this amount of money more or less than what I would spend at a bar over five hours... games win pretty much all the time!
The beginning of the game when you are limited to Hogwarts and Hogsmeade is fantastic. They did a great job designing the castle and the attention to detail is awesome. You can spend a good few dozen hours wandering around and doing the initial quests and side quests. As soon soon as you leave those areas, and have to venture outside, the game goes to shit. The rpg aspects are nonexistent and the story is poor. There is also zero replay value. That being said I think I got my moneys worth at $60 so half off will be well worth it.
    Yeah, most of the other villages and explorable areas feel a bit repetetive. Rather than have such a large map to explore, i would have preferred they let us go to diagon alley instead, as it would feel more lived in and populated, like hogsmeade.
Can you get away with just running around exploring hogwarts without doing the main quest? 

Once they announced the game I was pretty pissed it was another good v evil battle story. 

Just let me run around hogwarts and fuck around, HP Sorcerers Stone PC style.
    Yes and no. Legacy is the first game I've played in decades for reference. You can wander around almost endlessly it seems and do little puzzles or collect things. But in order to do more puzzles and collect more things while exploring is to learn spells and level up. So you don't have to follow the story per se but you can only do so much quality exploring without it. I've been playing for a week or so and I've only explored like 10% of the game even without a ton of story work. My one complaint is that it's not very clear what the objective is for the current task or battle is. I'm doing a lot of guessing and googling to even know wtf I'm doing half the time.
Not really.. you can explore the entire castle in a couple hours.
    If you can remember all the hallways and stairwells you’ve already been down lol
Idk why people expected a game like this. It was always going to be a standard AAA open world game. 

Do any games really exist like you describe?  Something like that would be awesome for someone who really wants to get immersed in that kind of experience, but absolutely atrocious for everyone else. By default, that style of game would require so many repetitive experiences to simulate day to day living
    To be fair, if they had removed the day/night cycle and forced you to use your bed at times to advance the story (by starting a new day), have classes be done in order rather than multiple available you can pick, than it'd be doable that way and sorta work. 

They just chose to go more open world and give more freedom. It works as is, though I do wish they'd provided more tools to RP the other way (like letting us sleep in our bed)
    Bully: hands down
    Games like Bully and the Persona series absolutely did pull off simulating day to day school life and still making it fun. It can be done!
They spent so much damn time on the clothes and the selection ended up being both gigantic and insubstantial at the same time. I’d much rather have fewer options that I could color as I like than three dozen variations on blazer and waistcoat uniforms.

I wish they gave us the Ashwinder/Poacher uniforms as well. They already built the assets for the enemies and they looked so damn cool.
It was totally a gateway game for me as well! I just played Jedi: Fallen Order and Jedi: Survivor and loved them!
I spin every globe I see
I actually did that myself for one game! Have you considered going to a pawn shop? You'll probably be able to find a used system that works perfectly well, and when you're done with the game, you can take it back to them for maybe $50 less than what you paid for it. And of course you have to pay for the game itself. That might sound like a lot, but lots of games take many dozens of hours to finish. And everything's digital nowadays, so if you ever buy the system "for real," the game will be available on your account.

It wasn't for Harry Potter. It was for a Persona game. Off-topic, but if you have any interest in a story about high school kids entering a magical world, learning fantastic abilities, and accomplishing incredible things while still going to school, I absolutely cannot recommend Persona 5 (Royal) highly enough.
    This is good tips. Didn’t think of a pawn shop. But we could buy an older or used PlayStation or Xbox maybe 🤔. The Persona game sounds good. I’m not a gamer at all though. Hogwarts Legacy really has me considering wanting to play a game for the first time!
        Like most everything else in life, there's a whole lot of obnoxious garbage, but there's also some really good and worthwhile stuff. There's some really beautiful games out there.

And yeah, I recommend doing exactly that. You don't have to worry about opening a bunch of boxes and thinking about how you might get rid of the thing if you don't like it. You can go to a pawn shop, grab the thing and take it home, and plug it in. Done. Worst case scenario, you fiddle with it for 30 minutes, and decide it really isn't for you. You take it right back and you've spent $100 or so. Not the end of the world.
I absolutely agree, I was very disappointed with the game. Breathtaking, sure, but I hated every interaction, side-character, collectable. Never attempted to finish it.
Or collect them to sell them in Hogsmeade :)
    To poachers
Lol I just sell them what thr shop keep clames to do with them us her business

My one complaint is that it's not very clear what the objective is for the current task or battle is. I'm doing a lot of guessing and googling to even know wtf I'm doing half the time.
If you can remember all the hallways and stairwells you’ve already been down lol
To be fair, if they had removed the day/night cycle and forced you to use your bed at times to advance the story (by starting a new day), have classes be done in order rather than multiple available you can pick, than it'd be doable that way and sorta work. 

They just chose to go more open world and give more freedom. It works as is, though I do wish they'd provided more tools to RP the other way (like letting us sleep in our bed)
Bully: hands down
Games like Bully and the Persona series absolutely did pull off simulating day to day school life and still making it fun. It can be done!
This is good tips. Didn’t think of a pawn shop. But we could buy an older or used PlayStation or Xbox maybe 🤔. The Persona game sounds good. I’m not a gamer at all though. Hogwarts Legacy really has me considering wanting to play a game for the first time!
    Like most everything else in life, there's a whole lot of obnoxious garbage, but there's also some really good and worthwhile stuff. There's some really beautiful games out there.

And yeah, I recommend doing exactly that. You don't have to worry about opening a bunch of boxes and thinking about how you might get rid of the thing if you don't like it. You can go to a pawn shop, grab the thing and take it home, and plug it in. Done. Worst case scenario, you fiddle with it for 30 minutes, and decide it really isn't for you. You take it right back and you've spent $100 or so. Not the end of the world.
To poachers
To be fair, you rescue them from a hazardous forest, where too many respawning poachers try to capture them, and then release them into a seemingly endless magical sanctuary, where nothing can really harm them.

Except for some greedy school kid, harvesting some feathers, in exchange for food and groom. Could be worse I guess
The game pretty clearly shows the poachers skinning beasts for their pelts, killing them for other magical properties of their body parts, and/or using the beasts in fighting rings (like dragons).

So I do think the implementation / idea of the player character going around “capturing” beasts is a bit weird, but’s it’s completely different to what the poachers are doing to them.
You need them for resources to upgrade other then that you could just sell them and buy what you need
No. But I'd imagine this game will get a second one. 

The reception and sales were too good.
    How would they do a second game? Just keep the exact same map?
        They could do it further in the future/past and change the surrounding grounds based on that. The castle layout would mostly stay the same but entirely new puzzles.
            Aka the Tears of the Kingdom approach.
                Essentially, yes.
            Some have mentioned the possibility of placing the sequel alongside either the Marauders, 1st Wizarding War, or HP timelines, and having the player's story occur simultaneously, witnessing key moments from a new/different perspective. I like this idea.
        Dawg the map of  hogwarts is alive and always changing so yeah
        I can see them changing the setting ala GTA. 

If not they can always set the story in a different time era.
Yes, but no. They announced a multiplayer [Quidditch game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter:_Quidditch_Champions) in 2023 (which is probably why Quidditch wasn't included in Legacy). 

"The player controls a character that holds a specific position in Quidditch and engages in broomstick adventures and competitive multiplayer modes."

"The game's visual style is distinct from ... *Hogwarts Legacy*, as it endeavors to have a more stylized and cartoon-like appearance. ... the game is not a direct adaptation of the books or films. The developers strive to maintain the authenticity of J. K. Rowling's original vision while also introducing innovative elements that allow fans to explore the world of magic"
Only the reignited trilogy, which is to the original what Disney live-action remakes are to their animated counterparts. To anyone who likes the reignited trilogy, good for you, but you clearly like Spyro for completely different reasons than I do. For me, the remake holds literally none of the magic the original (my favorite game of all time) did for me.
That's good to know, I have one and it's not sitting in a box somewhere so it's even better!
