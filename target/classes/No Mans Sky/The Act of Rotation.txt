Normal Eissentam
    At nighttime it looks even better! Amazing work!

You should start a museum fr fr
    So iv never quite got how public bases work. Is this something we can visit with the glyph at the bottom? Cuz i would love to give my vr legs a workout with this wonderful thing you've made, lol
        Yes the glyphs at the bottom will lead you to a portal on the planet that this base is on. Fly into space and look for a base symbol (usually a marker on the screen with a purple icon that has a dome shape in it) and fly towards it and it should be the base. 

Thats assuming OP uploaded the base to be public.

Also you need to be in the same galaxy as OP for the glyphs to work properly. Hopefully the base is in Euclid.

                I‚Äôll be visiting you in next 24h in VR. It will blow my mind.

            How many galaxies are there? And how can one travel specifically to a particular galaxy?
                255 different galaxies. If you have the glyphs unlocked you can find glyph coordinates to a galaxy‚Äôs center. I believe the same sequence can get you within 3000 lightyears of the core of a galaxy. Travel through each core brings you to the next galaxy and they are not random so its just a matter of warping and getting to the galaxy you want.

Most fun stuff posted is in Euclid and Eissentam. The other way is to have a fellow traveller be in the galaxy you want, be friends with them and join their game in that galaxy. Plant a base down and then you can exit from multiplayer, load up your save and begin travelling around that galaxy via your base. Then use glyphs to get to other spots in that galaxy. 

/r/NMSCoordinateExchange has a ton of good content for ships, bases and multi-tools or even nice planets to build communities onto
                    You can also find other cool starships, multitools, creatures, planets and more over at [r/NMSGlyphExchange](https://www.reddit.com/r/NMSGlyphExchange/)!

                There are currently 256, I believe, with 1 or 2 of them being unreachable, unless you know someone who can get you there (They had to access the galaxy in earlier versions of the game and build a base/have a save file to be able to get there). Euclid is the 1st/starter galaxy, and from the center, you can travel to the Hilbert Dimension (The 2nd), or alternatively, finishing the Atlas questline gives you an option to discover more of them without having to reach the center, as well, one of which is Eissentam (The 10th).
If you don't have time, or are new to the game, I would suggest visiting the Anomaly, and going to the Portal room, then visit the featured coffee shop base (Consider turning off PvP in your network settings before teleporting though, as it has been known to get griefers who will kill you endlessly in the spawning location). The base in this post is built in the Eissentam Galaxy, and the Featured Cafe is as well, so it's a fast pass to the right system. From there, acquire at least 3 of the Ancient Structure maps from the chart vender on the Space Station. You have a 1/3 chance to find a Monolith in the system which for the price of the systems relic (Gek Relic, Vykeen Dagger, Korvax Casing) can give you directions to the Portal, and it'll likely have a base near/at it (If this base is blocking the use of the portal, simply report the base in your toggle menu, like where you'd change to first person/third person. Reporting it will remove it from your game). After that, you use the Portal, which will require a full Glyph Set, and some common resources to power the Portal. From there, follow the glyphs from the video, and locate the base in that system!

Note: Taking the teleporter does not break equipment, so your tech will be fine.
Also, if you don't have any of the relics, you can typically buy them off ship dealers at Trading Posts and aboard the Space Station.
                    Ah, the feature coffee shop shortcut is extremely useful. i had no idea that it was in a different system. Thank you for that tip
                Eissentam is one of the first galaxies you can open by going to the galactic center.  The newest expedition was in Eissentam.  Also if someone has a showcased base on the portal in a different galaxy you can get there that way and just set up a portal to make it easier going forward.  Lastly if you party with someone in another galaxy you can zone to them from the anomaly.

That is it though, start there due to an expedition, unlock it by following the plot, joining a party member there, or port there by a showcased base.
            Also as far as i know permadeath as it's own multiverse separate from survival
        Hopefully you don't get motion sickness during normal gameplay lmao
            Nah, i got strong vr legs. i just want to push my limits! Lmao

Wow! Day 1 player here, seen a lot of things creative people did ingame but this one is absolutely the best and craziest one ever! Congrats!
I feel like Dr. Manhattan should appear soon
    Dicks out for Manhattan
I showed a coworker and we were wondering how long did it take you to build this?
    It took a whole day
        It's beautiful üòç
    I would also like to know this - btw, you're in Euclid (sp??) galaxy, yes?
        Eissentam
Gorgeous
That looks fantastic, well done! üòÉ
Amazing
This is great!
Awesome! Thanks for sharing.
The G-Force must be extraordinary! üòù

And just when I thought I was building some pretty cool things.... 

Incredible!
THIS IS AMAZING!
Wow. Amazing work!!
Sorry for cursing but

Time to put on some Tool and hang out at this base for a few hours üòÅ
Wait, how does each teleporter tp you inside the next one? Are there actually two at each spot? Is that even possible?
    yep,using glitchbuild
Oh my wow

Its fantastic üëè
Wow, absolutely epic!
Too many posts to read, but did Dr. Manhattan design that?
No fucking way.
Nothing short of amazing. Well done.
HE'S GOING TO WARP
I feel like that many teleports will.make my ps5 crash lol.

Good shit
Amazing building but ultimately a Genius idea üí°
Omg this is insane, amazing and genius. Impressive.
Mind blowing, cool idea!
Holy shit this is amazing
mind bending
Me at first glance: is that a marker?
I am in Spain without the a üò¢
This is the most amazing thing I've ever seen in my life. 

I still have no idea how you did it, or how this works lol
That's brilliant.
This has no right to be this cool.
So did you stack two teleporters so the receiver places you in a transmitter to the next pod over?  

Very cool!  Gorgeous even!

Can someone explain what we are looking at here? I just got the game and am only several hours in just getting the hang of it. But the more I see of the game the more I realize it is massive and I don‚Äôt even know half of what is going on. So what is this?
OK Dr Manhatten
God damn
Okay... this is cool.
Man that music was destroyed compared to the original...
Now do it in VR!

Well
... guess someone's gonna have to use that concept to go around an entire planet.
I can just imagine how this would go on my Series X, haha.

Where in gods name do you people find the patience for this
As someone slightly obsessed with spirals, thank you very much ! That's magnificient.
How did you align them so well?

        Dang, crazy amazing
This would crash nearly any other game out there, regardless of how powerful your computer is.... Somehow Hello Games not only built a universe larger than our theoretical universe... But they also made a ridiculously sturdy game engine (in it's current state).

Like... this SHOULD NOT work...
God, this is so cool but I‚Äôm terrified for my ps4
Just don‚Äôt take LSD when you go into that thing lmao
That‚Äôs amazing.
Wow. Amazing!
Awesome build!!
I was wondering why the games been so laggy, this mf took up all the servers to load this! /s ü§£ü§£ü§£ this is dope af, m8! Kudos for the patience to make it!
Most creative build I've seen in years.
Our man Sean need to see this
Mind blowing...truly Fucking Awesome üëå  How long to build something like this??
    a whole day
That's the most impressive no Man's sky build I've ever seen

Super cool.

Just wished you'd gone for "you spin me right round" for the 80s song instead of the eurythmics cover, would've been more appropriate :P
Yall are amazing ü§£
I hate you. That's fucking amazing. üëè
Jesus Christ the fps.
200,000 units are ready, with a million more well on the way.
This is amazing, but I think will probably feel sick using VR  on it![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
Now imagine if someone did this but as an F-ZERO track on some random planet.

Travel through each core brings you to the next galaxy and they are not random so its just a matter of warping and getting to the galaxy you want.

Most fun stuff posted is in Euclid and Eissentam. The other way is to have a fellow traveller be in the galaxy you want, be friends with them and join their game in that galaxy. Plant a base down and then you can exit from multiplayer, load up your save and begin travelling around that galaxy via your base. Then use glyphs to get to other spots in that galaxy. 

/r/NMSCoordinateExchange has a ton of good content for ships, bases and multi-tools or even nice planets to build communities onto

There are currently 256, I believe, with 1 or 2 of them being unreachable, unless you know someone who can get you there (They had to access the galaxy in earlier versions of the game and build a base/have a save file to be able to get there). Euclid is the 1st/starter galaxy, and from the center, you can travel to the Hilbert Dimension (The 2nd), or alternatively, finishing the Atlas questline gives you an option to discover more of them without having to reach the center, as well, one of which is Eissentam (The 10th).
If you don't have time, or are new to the game, I would suggest visiting the Anomaly, and going to the Portal room, then visit the featured coffee shop base (Consider turning off PvP in your network settings before teleporting though, as it has been known to get griefers who will kill you endlessly in the spawning location). The base in this post is built in the Eissentam Galaxy, and the Featured Cafe is as well, so it's a fast pass to the right system. From there, acquire at least 3 of the Ancient Structure maps from the chart vender on the Space Station. You have a 1/3 chance to find a Monolith in the system which for the price of the systems relic (Gek Relic, Vykeen Dagger, Korvax Casing) can give you directions to the Portal, and it'll likely have a base near/at it (If this base is blocking the use of the portal, simply report the base in your toggle menu, like where you'd change to first person/third person. Reporting it will remove it from your game). After that, you use the Portal, which will require a full Glyph Set, and some common resources to power the Portal. From there, follow the glyphs from the video, and locate the base in that system!

Note: Taking the teleporter does not break equipment, so your tech will be fine.
Also, if you don't have any of the relics, you can typically buy them off ship dealers at Trading Posts and aboard the Space Station.
    Ah, the feature coffee shop shortcut is extremely useful. i had no idea that it was in a different system. Thank you for that tip
Eissentam is one of the first galaxies you can open by going to the galactic center.  The newest expedition was in Eissentam.  Also if someone has a showcased base on the portal in a different galaxy you can get there that way and just set up a portal to make it easier going forward.  Lastly if you party with someone in another galaxy you can zone to them from the anomaly.

That is it though, start there due to an expedition, unlock it by following the plot, joining a party member there, or port there by a showcased base.
