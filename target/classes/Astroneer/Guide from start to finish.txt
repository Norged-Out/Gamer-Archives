[[Guide from start to finish]]


Hi everyone, I present you the detailed guide on how to finish Astroneer and not spent eternity on that. Goal of this guide is to give you the overall look at what you need and when, in order to progress through game fairly quickly and not feel bored or exhausted. So if you are new to the game or you have problems with progression I believe this guide is for you.

# Introduction

Before we start, I recommend you finishing ingame tutorial. This way you will be familiar with controls and basic concepts like, crafting, research and resources, I won't be discussing this aspects in this guide. Also, [Wikipedia](https://astroneer.gamepedia.com/Astroneer_Wiki) is your best friend, there will be few links - mostly for pictures.

Your overall goal in game is to visit every planet and interact with "a big purple", that structure need energy. I don't want to spoil you the game though, so if you want to discover that part on your own just know how it looks, here is a link to a picture ([gateway](https://astroneer.gamepedia.com/File:Gateway_Chamber_Inactive.jpg)).

# First steps

When you start new game you will land on Sylva, this is your starting planet. Right now you have nothing and you need everything. Start by ordering your cargo drop, put Oxygenator in a dedicated slot in your Shelter, this is very important. Now look around and locate [Compound](https://astroneer.gamepedia.com/Compound) and [Resin](https://astroneer.gamepedia.com/Resin), then go and collect 2-4 of each. Now you need two basic items that you will carry with you pretty much all the time, [Tethers](https://astroneer.gamepedia.com/Tether) and [Small Canisters](https://astroneer.gamepedia.com/Small_Canister). You should also print a small printer from your backpack and put it on the same platform you already have medium printer on.

Next step is to start your research, print [Large Platform A](https://astroneer.gamepedia.com/Large_Platform_A) and [Research Chamber](https://astroneer.gamepedia.com/Research_Chamber), put them together and connect to your grid, then go and collect some [Research Items](https://astroneer.gamepedia.com/Research_Items). You can find them in trees, on rocks, or under some plants e.g. [Bouncevine](https://astroneer.gamepedia.com/File:Bouncevine.png). You can also get a significant amount of bytes from [Harvestables](https://astroneer.gamepedia.com/File:Harvestable.jpg), they appear on small bushes and can be gathered by holding F. They also **regrow everyday**, so don't destroy their base by digging them out. There is a lot of these around your starting point, you can always build a small grid of tethers and then take a trip every morning to gather them. You can easly collect \~300 bytes each day, this way. Alternatively you can place them in Research Chamber, they will yield roughly 3 times more bytes this way, but the whole process may take up to \~10 minutes per Sample.

Be aware that your research speed is determined by your power production and right now with only basic RTG in Shelter your production is not great. Run around and look for wrecks and debris, ignore broken parts, you are looking for working [Solar Panels](https://astroneer.gamepedia.com/Small_Solar_Panel) and [Wind Turbines](https://astroneer.gamepedia.com/Small_Wind_Turbine). The medium versions are good, but they require dedicated platforms, unlike small ones that can be placed directly on the ground. [Small Batteries](https://astroneer.gamepedia.com/Small_Battery) are also great find, you can put them on your Shelter (there are 2 single slots on outside walls). For the purpose of burning [Organic](https://astroneer.gamepedia.com/Organic) you will collect anyway, craft one or two [Small Generators](https://astroneer.gamepedia.com/Small_Generator). If you happen to find them it will be even better. If your energy production will become dependant on Small Generators, and you will find yourself in need of collecting Organic, consider unlocking [Inhibitor Mod](https://astroneer.gamepedia.com/Inhibitor_Mod) (even though it costs 1000 bytes). It will let you collect Organic as well as clearing paths through forest, with the benefit of not destroying smooth terrain and not digging out sources of Harvestables (this also apply to clearing caves). Plants will then regrow on intact patches of land.

Now when you have enough bytes don't feel tempted to research random stuff, your byte collecting efficiency is very low and you don't want to waste 30 minutes worth of bytes on item you might not even need. You want to progress through technology as efficient as possible. Right now the thing you need the most is [Smelting Furnace](https://astroneer.gamepedia.com/Smelting_Furnace) and [Soil Centrifuge](https://astroneer.gamepedia.com/Soil_Centrifuge). Research them, print and then put on their own Large Platforms A. These Platforms, by the way, will be your best ones for next 2-3 hours. **Don't research other platforms yet**.

While your research is in progress, go and find closest cave entrance, one should be very close to your starting base. Don't focus on making it pretty, but make sure it's functional, put your tethers and go underground. Try to place them as far apart as you can, good rule of thumb is to walk, then when your connection to last tether breaks, place next tether (tethers have slightly longer lines than your character). All you need now from this cave is some [Quartz](https://astroneer.gamepedia.com/Quartz) and [Laterite](https://astroneer.gamepedia.com/Laterite). There will be some Harvestables as well, collect them, but **do not** dug them out, these will be your everyday extra bytes. When your backpack is full go back to your base and store your resources. You can either use [Medium Storage](https://astroneer.gamepedia.com/Medium_Storage) or just dump them on the ground, they won't disappear. If your base by that point starts looking like a mess, don't worry this is temporary, you will soon get access to your final items. Keep in mind that you will need fair amount of Resin for Platforms you already print. Collect it if you have a chance. That is also why you need your tether line to the cave. You can always use Soil Centrifuge to get more Resin or Compound. Always empty your Small Canisters (always carry 2-3 of them with you) to Soil Centrifuge, if there is no [Ammonium](https://astroneer.gamepedia.com/Ammonium) deposit nearby, print it. It is expensive, but you will absolutely need at least 4 of it. Other use for Soil is to substitute whatever you need at that moment. If you need something as simple as Organic for your Genertor, or you can't find Quartz, don't hesitate and print it, after all Soil is everywhere.

Right now your trips are fairly limited by your tether coverage, and it is a strong limitation, if you have enough bytes, research [Small Oxygen Tank](https://astroneer.gamepedia.com/Small_Oxygen_Tank), then print 2 of them and put in your backpack. Here is how you use them without dying surprised. You can rely on them while you roam on the surface, but you should always see your base or at very least base beacon. Don't go further than that, there is no need. When your character starts using backpack reserve of oxygen, **immediately** head back to base (or closest tether lines) and then **fully** fill your oxygen tanks. When you are underground **always** be in a range of your tethers, it's not only easier to get lost there, but if you die, you won't be able to see a beacon from your dead body.

# Visiting other planets

Now it's time to research [Small Shuttle](https://astroneer.gamepedia.com/Small_Shuttle) and [Solid-Fuel Thruster](https://astroneer.gamepedia.com/Solid-Fuel_Thruster). Print Large Printer, then Small Shuttle and single Solid-Fuel Thruster. This Thruster allows you to take two way trip, to a planet of you choice and back, but **no side trips**. Your destination now is Glacio. Since Small Shuttle don't have cargo bay, all you can take have to fit to your backpack. Go and store everything you have in your base, you are going to another planet "naked" and you are not going to establish your base there yet. You will need to bring single Small Canister with you in case you need to build a ramp. If you want, you can grab few [Packagers](https://astroneer.gamepedia.com/Packager), but you have to research them first, so if you are currently out of bytes, don't worry you are going to visit Glacio for second time anyway. If you have them researched however, but didn't found nor printed any [Graphite](https://astroneer.gamepedia.com/Graphite) it's still not a problem, you will find it on the surface of Glacio. You are ready to go, your main goal is to gather at least 1 [Hematite](https://astroneer.gamepedia.com/Hematite), and at least 1 Research Item. If you don't have Packagers you can store one Research Item in your Shuttle in slot dedicated for Oxygenator. If you have packagers or you've found Graphite deposit, then Research Items have priority (still bring at least 1 Hematite), they are one of the most valuable things you will find on Glacio, their byte content varies from 1500 to 7500 bytes. You don't need tethers, you can carry your Shuttle with you and it will provide you oxygen as long as you are close to it (even without oxygenator). **Fair warning though**, Glacio have one specific aggressive flora specie named [Cataplant](https://astroneer.gamepedia.com/File:Hazard_Lobber.jpg), it will shot you with **explosive** blobs that can **blow up your shuttle and kill you**. They however hide precious Research Items underneath, that is absolutely worth being dug out, just be careful with them.

Now when your backpack is full of Hematite and Research Items (don't collect anything else), there is nothing more to do on Glacio, and you should go back to Sylva. When you arrive, put your Hematite into Smelting Furnace and start research with your newly acquired Research Items.

Your next trip will be to Vesania. You need [Titanite](https://astroneer.gamepedia.com/Titanite) from there. Again you will go with empty backpack and single Small Canister, with new Solid-Fuel Thruster, and you are going only for Titanite. Vesania also have dangerous flora, especially [Lashleaf](https://astroneer.gamepedia.com/File:Lashleaf.png), that can catapult you into air, so be careful. You will find Titanite on small mountains, single node will yield 6-10 units, collect them and head back to Sylva. Again use the trick with carrying Shuttle with you for oxygen and don't waste space for Tethers.

For you third trip you are going to Calidor, this time for [Wolframite](https://astroneer.gamepedia.com/Wolframite). Once again empty backpack with single Small Canister and new Solid-Fuel Thruster. When you land go straight to Wolframite deposit, it will be easy to find on the surface. Don't bother collecting anything else, and be careful, Calidor have some nasty canyons and holes in its surface, you don't want to fall into them, also avoid any flora. It is not as dangerous as on Glacio, but you can still die to it. When you collect enough Wolframite, head back to Sylva.

You should now have all you need, research and then print [Chemistry Lab](https://astroneer.gamepedia.com/Chemistry_Lab) and [Atmospheric Condenser](https://astroneer.gamepedia.com/Atmospheric_Condenser) (in that order). After all three trips it is time to boost your space travel, to it's final form. Research Large Shuttle (yes, you can easly skip Medium Shuttle) and print it (from [Large Printer](https://astroneer.gamepedia.com/Large_Printer)). Print your last Solid-Fuel Thruster as well. Research [Large Storage](https://astroneer.gamepedia.com/Large_Storage) and then print 2 of them. If by that time you have found [Large Platform B](https://astroneer.gamepedia.com/Large_Platform_B), that's great, if you didn't, you have to research it and print. Put it on your Large Shuttle together with Atmospheric Condenser, and Wind Turbine. Atmospheric Condenser and Large Platform B should be packed and you need 2 Packagers with you for that trip. Single Medium Wind Turbine will be enough and you can carry it as it is. Now it's time to visit Glacio again, this time you are going to collect [Argon](https://astroneer.gamepedia.com/Argon). Since you now have Large Shuttle and thus much more space, take both of your Oxygen Tanks with you. When you land, go somewhere high, you need a lot of wind, don't hide in valleys, if you are on the flat "snowy desert" you are at good height. Place your platform and Atmospheric Condenser, attach Wind Turbine and let it spin. You need 2-3 barrels of Argon at least. The more the better, 5 will be more than enough. It will take some time, use it to walk around and look for more Research Items. You should have 4-5 dual slots available on your Shuttle (if you equipped it with 2 Large Storages). Keep in mind you need space to bring Atmospheric Condenser, Platform and Wind Turbine back with you. If you took Packagers with you it's even better. Also don't forget to bring a backpack of Hematite. When you are ready pack everything and go back to Sylva.

After this last trip, it's time to research [Hydrazine Thruster](https://astroneer.gamepedia.com/Hydrazine_Thruster) and print it. Now you can travel wherever you want and it is super cheap. Ammonium can be easly printed from Soil and [Hydrogen](https://astroneer.gamepedia.com/Hydrogen) is available on Sylva. At this point you should have a lot of bytes from all Research Items you've bringed from Glacio. Research [Extra Large Platform C](https://astroneer.gamepedia.com/Extra_Large_Platform_C) and start organising your base. Typically it is very functional to place 2 Large Storages filled with Medium Storages in the middle and then 2 "production" units outside (e.g. Smelting Furnace). For all type of equipment you can build you will need 3 of these Platforms (they cost you [Steel](https://astroneer.gamepedia.com/Steel) and [Iron](https://astroneer.gamepedia.com/Iron), but you will need 1 Steel for RTG soon, so take this into consideration if you don't have plenty of Iron right now).

# Energy production

Now it's time for managing your surroundings. Since you have high end Platforms, and should have unlocked all important modules including [Trade Platform](https://astroneer.gamepedia.com/Trade_Platform), consider unlocking [Extra Large Shredder](https://astroneer.gamepedia.com/Extra_Large_Shredder) now.

With your new Hydrazine Thruster it is time for final trip before you unlock full potential of unlimited energy. Grab your packed Atmospheric Condenser and Platform, both, Solar Panel and Wind Turbine - you can use Small version of those - and fly to Atrox. You are there for [Helium](https://astroneer.gamepedia.com/Helium). Since its concentration is very low and there is not much of sun or wind, it will be painful to collect much of it, but you need at least 2 units (full barrel have 5). Again **fair warning**, Atrox have very hostile flora, everything there wants to get you, especially [Attactus](https://astroneer.gamepedia.com/File:Hazard_Shooter.jpg), it will shot you with some sort of **explosive projectile**, that can **blow up your shuttle and kill you**. Avoid it at all cost, you have been warned. Now with your Helium collected you can go back to Sylva.

Now it's time to boost your energy production, research [RTG](https://astroneer.gamepedia.com/RTG). It is expensive, but once you get it you will get a steady energy supply which will improve your production speed. Now for RTG you will need [Lithium](https://astroneer.gamepedia.com/Lithium), but since it is notoriously difficult to find on either [Vesania](https://astroneer.gamepedia.com/Vesania) and [Novus](https://astroneer.gamepedia.com/Novus), I recommend using Trade Platform, that you've already unlocked. You will need Shredder for that as well, but if you've followed this guide this should not be the problem either, and you should already have 4 used Solid-Fuel Thrusters to scrap, not to mention all the debris around your base. Technically you can find Lithium on Novus deep underground and on top of "non-existing" mountains, or on Vesania, but for that you need to dig your own cave entrance and with some luck hit cave that actually have Lithium. It is much easier to get it from Trade Platform anyway.

# End game

At this point you should have unlocked all important high end items. All you need to do is establishing bases on all planets and moons. Since you already have Large Shuttle and Hydrazine Thruster, traveling is no longer an issue. For all first trip with plan to establish outpost on each planet, you should start with bringing [Shelter](https://astroneer.gamepedia.com/Shelter) and [LandingPad](https://astroneer.gamepedia.com/Landing_Pad). Then choose landing zone close to mentioned "purple thingy", you will see it from orbit as it emits a column of purple light. Then grab your Shuttle and walk with it until you find a place where you want to have your base. I recommend placing your own Landing Pad outside of predefined landing zone and not too close to "purple thing", but also close to your Shelter as it has beacon visible from orbit and thus allowing you to select correct landing zone. Leave yourself some space for expanding your base, but none the less stay close to gateway.

Start with bases on Glacio (because of Hematite and Argon) then Atrox (because of Sulfur and Helium), rest is up to you. But with these 2 you can switch your energy production to RTG only for cheap.

For much more convenient way of carrying Shuttle with you from Landing Zone to place where you want to unpack your Shelter, consider using [Hydrazine Jet Pack](https://astroneer.gamepedia.com/Hydrazine_Jet_Pack) as you can fly with anything in your hands at full speed, while on foot you can't even walk if you hold Shuttle.

# Tips

* You can carry Shuttle with you for oxygen if you don't want to waste space for Tethers and Tethers will only work if Shuttle have Oxygenator
* Oxygenator slot in Shuttle can be used to carry anything, not only Oxygenator. It is especially usefull to carry Research Items.
* Some bushes have plenty of Harvestables, you can collect bytes from them by holding F, and they regrow everyday.
* Inhibitor Mod for Terrain Tool allows to gather Organic without destroying bushes with Harvestables as well as trees producing Research Items and rocks with Research Samples that are in caves.
* If you have Jetpack, you can fly with anything in your hands, including Large Shuttle, at full speed. This is useful for finding good spot for a base on new planet.
* If you miscalculate your journey on Solid Fuel Thruster or lose whole Shuttle, don't panic. Every planet have Resin, Compound, Laterite and Ammonium, so you can start from scratch like you did on Sylva.


this is insane
amazingly done. some extra details about using the core machines like the smelting furnace or the research chamber could be good to help the new players, because this was what i struggled with when i first started playing...
Well done
Fantastic guide absolutely worth my time to read.
You can mark your new landing pad with a Beacon. It just costs a quartz, and like you said, it'll be very easy to spot if ots apart from any other landing zones
Overall the guide is really good :)

But the part you highlighted Don\`t Unpack the atmospheric condenser is wrong.  If you don\`t unpack it, then how are you going to make the 2 Titanium Alloy that\`s needed to build the large rocket?
    I agree, you need to build and use one ( atmospheric condenser)  on Sylva first to Get Hydrogen& Nitrogen --> Hydrazyne --> few steps then to Titanium Alloy --> Large Shuttle!
This is such an amazing guide thanks a lot! Helped me deciding what to do next.
Cheers mate. Just got the game and used your guide to learn. Played untill 5am. Totaly worth it.
Great guide. Thanks. But now that PS4 is out it isn't easy for us to carry the shuttle around. The right stick cursor is so slow and there are no options to increase it's speed. 
During my game on PS4 I would fill my backpack with tethers when going to planets at first. I would drop any tethers I didn't need and fill my backpack the rest of the way with resources. When I got the repackager I packed up the tractor and a trailer and a medium storages. They all fit in the backpack and are expendable. The other slots I put 3 small batteries and 2 small wind turbines thus giving me a mobile air supply and transport faster than walking.

I never understood why you can pick up a massive loaded shuttle but not an empty large rover.

Thanks again.
I am stuck on the first planet because the research unit seems to not be working: it starts examining but it doesn't work, it's like broken. The arms lift but don't connect properly and the machine doesn't really start.
    If by research unit you mean Research Chamber, then it needs power to operate. You have to place it on a platform. In lower part of platforms are power connectors with lights. If it's blinking red it means you have insufficient power. It can be either because you produce too little or not at all. Your Habitat provides bare minimum of energy but should be enough to operate Research Chamber alone.
        Ahhh now I understand: I connected it to the main base, so I guess the energy is not enough to work properly.

Thank you for help!
            Well all connected platforms create grid, so you can connect Small Generator and its power production would contribute to entire grid. One note on charging backpack battery, it's very power hungry process, but once it's done Research Chamber should work.
You mention that if you lose your shuttle you can start again on the any planet. How do you start again with no oxygen and power production?
    No oxygen **and** no power, on their own are not the end of the world. It entirely depends on you, if you want to wait for death and then respawn on your last save point, which is always an object that provides you with oxygen, or if you want to fight your way to survive.

Now for surviving in that situation you have to dig out some Resin and craft Oxygen filters, then run around and find solar panel or wind turbine, put it on your shoulder and as long as you keep an eye on you oxygen level you will be fine. Yes, it will be a little more difficult to survive, but it is certainly possible. From that point you just start as usual, Printers, Platforms, eventually you'll make it to print Habitat.
        I appreciate the reply. I got stuck on Glacio, I got a decent restart base going but could never find Laterite to make a thruster so I restarted.

One suggestion I have. When going to Atrox bringing some small generators (made them on the planet actually) worked out far better since there are organics everywhere to burn.
I say you should always use large platform type B as it stores the output on either side 
Someone should do something like this for all the new updates, I'm in 2023 and still using this for a basis though
    Quests make it a little easier now
This is an insanely good guide, while some of it is made easier by completing missions, that I guess didn't exist at the time of creation, I'm very grateful.

In the very beginning, I struggled because I didn't notice the cargo drop, and didn't know I had to unpack it, but besides that this guide helped a ton.
I've been playing through using this guide and loving every second!  
I just wish it was even longer, (even though you've already put in so much effort).
