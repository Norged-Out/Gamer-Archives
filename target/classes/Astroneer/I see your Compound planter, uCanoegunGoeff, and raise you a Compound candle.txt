[[I see your Compound planter, uCanoegunGoeff, and raise you a Compound candle]]





I love the candle haha! The cute dragon creature is adorable too! Is that from some franchise or just a random stuffy?
    Its an Astroneer Snail creature thing, from hit game Astroneer, probably, I donâ€™t know for sure, it might be something completely different, idk
        Ohhh it might be! I just got back into the game last week after not playing for almost 3 years and have not encountered the snails yet but it does look like there is a snail shell in the back of it there!
            They're part of a quest line, they show up after you do certain things and you can suck them into a terrarium to keep as a pet. When you feed them you get a bonus.
    It's a gastropod. You can tame them and they have different uses
        Galastropod*
Where did you get the cute gastrapod plush?
    [https://store.astroneer.space/](https://store.astroneer.space/) but it's sold out ðŸ˜­

If we made more plushies, which galastropod would you like to see next? ðŸ¤”
        I'd like to collect all of them, but I think my favorite was princess. It would also be kind of cool if they came in their terrarium.
        I'd like to see an Eva plushie! And a retro suit plushie!
        Super cute but idk with one it is i thought it was enoki but he has a lot of eyes and his face is blob looking

I thought maybe itâ€™s Sylvie but it has Enoki green on it.

Either way its really cute
            The one in this picture is Sylvie, but be sure to cast your vote for our next plush in the [pinned post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Astroneer/comments/1bpbrvl/we_need_your_help_choosing_the_next_galastropod/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).
        I like Stilgar
Now we just need a resin candle for a resipound candle!
    Do you have any contacts at Hobby Lobby?  ðŸ¤”
        Sorry, no.
Compound candle (wrong color but it's ok), a cosmic bauble (love those), and Sylvie, the Galastropod that lights up the area with a 35 ft. radius
Oooo, nice Cosmic Bauble.
    oh that does look like a cosmic bauble!!  that hadn't even crossed my mind, lol
u/CanoegunGoeff did you buy the [Compound planter](https://www.reddit.com/r/Astroneer/comments/1b3k2om/found_some_compound_at_micheals/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)?
    I did not, I donâ€™t have a plant big enough for it anyway lol
Silva
