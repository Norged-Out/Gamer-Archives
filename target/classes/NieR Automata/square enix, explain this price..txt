[[square enix, explain this price.]]





REAL leather from the moose and wild boars in Automata
    At least 7 animals per item
    Real leather from 2B's boots.
I dont have that much money to put in there tbh
    All the money I would put in there is spent on the wallets themselves
        They just want to make sure it fits in your pocket! I know *I* couldn't pull off a messenger-style fanny pack as well as 9S does.
            Speaking of his fucking bag, I'm still mega butthurt that his leather bag is sold out. 
Like okay, it's a 300$ bag but it's basically a replica and oh my Jesus it would go so nice with the rest of the NieR fit. 

I've got the 2B handbag, the 9S backpack, now I just need a shoulder sling pack and I'd be complete with the bag drip.....but the only automata shoulder sling bag is the 9S one and it's sold out and never appears on the 2nd hand market. 

Sorry for the rant but I really want that damn bag.
                God, same here. $300 was already too much. I don't know how much more of a ridiculous price I'm willing to throw at that damn bag at this point, but it really does NEVER show up.
                    I cant tell you in human language how elated I was to actually be able to find the supergroupies 9S watch online. 

That thing is equally as rare as the bag, maybe rarer, and usually you could expect a super rare highly desired supergroupies watch to sell for like 800 on the second hand market.....bro I got it less than retail brand new. 200$ instead of 220 retail. 

I've been getting such good fucking deals recently it's actually stupid.

I got the Bayonetta watch for like 400$ brand new. Which also goes online 800-1k. Never go with eBay. Always go to some Japanese site. So many swindles.
                        I was just glad I didn't like the watch much. My 9S based outfit so far is the Supergroupies shoes and the official choker, so I feel like I need the bag to finish the look. 

And totally correct about ebay, there are fair odds that if you find that 9S bag on a JP auction and someone is fighting you for it, it's probably me lol. But I wish us both luck on finding it eventually!
                            HEEYYY BUDDDYYYY. Remember this conversation about the 9S shoulder bag?

Heheheh. Well guess whaaaat. I got one BRAND NEW, from ebay......today.......for 680$..... 

It hurt so fucking good. So good. It hurt. So. Good.
                                Daaaaaamnnn!! Congrats!! If you ever come across another, please send a link my way! It was for the best...I bought the 9S PC so I'm still recovering from that this month anyway. Also hurt really good oof
                                    Oh yeah I heard those PCs are really pricy for their specs tho. 

I'm actually planning on buying a prebuilt from digital storm for probably 4500-6500$. First PC. Looking to get that 4090 and i9 13900k. But yeah im paying an even bigger premium for them than what square was jabbing people for on their NieR PCS

I'm at least gonna get the PC in NieR colors tho. White cabling and such. 

I'm either going for their velox or their aventum model PC. Both will gut me for money. 

Never used loans or credit before since im young, this PC will probably be my first time I take out a loan for something. 

And yeah if I find a bag I'll shoot a link if I remember. I'll maybe send you some pictures of the bag later, it came in the mail today I think. Maybe a fashion shoot
                            Dang bro you don't like the watch?


Yeah my outfit for 9S has everything now for him except that bag. 

I've got his watch, shoes, boots, backpack, choker (was worried I'd look gay with that one, but it's pretty spiffy imo, in fact I wish they'd make a 2B choker now too with her dress pattern on it)

The only 9S stuff I'm missing besides that bag, is his older supergroupies jacket thats blue, and his old supergroupies chain bracelet watch.
                                Haha, yeah, I'm not really a watch person honestly. Plus, I've been trying to make an effort to not dress so masculinely lately, so I figured adding a men's watch to the mix probably wasn't the move for me. Jealous on the old boots because I couldn't track them down in my size!

The choker is such an interesting piece because even as a woman, I feel kinda weird about how it looks when wearing it normally. I like wearing mine in the bracelet style lol.

As for the chain watch, it may not be the correct one since I didn't click it, but I swear I just saw one on Yahoo Auctions or Mercari JP the other day.
Square Enix has been going nuts for a bit with their merch. Only for super fans with too much disposable income. The rest of us who aren't blessed with so much money are left with hardly anything of import.   


I wanna buy their stuff...but when there stuff costs as multiple purchases of the games their based on? Skip.
    The merch all seemed reasonable to me until these wallets.

Jewelry in the range of 150-240$ is reasonable I think, supergroupies stuff is very reasonably priced, music CDs are like 30-50$, vinyl is like 25$ individual,  100 as a collection, blu ray is like 50-70$, figures are 150-220 (until the latest A2 flare figure)

The only things that are kinda stupid with their price was the plushies and stuffies. Like....50$ for that?! Then again those items are always stupidly expensive and overpriced. 

The most stand out item is the prime 1 statue but that things price is very understandable to me.

Now these wallets on the other hand....so out of left field with the price. Like what are you doing square enix? Obviously making money based on the fact I bought the shits anyways, but like...bro are they alright? Do they think they're some luxury brand now or something? I haven't seen merch this expensive for any franchise. Any. 

I may be able to afford these wallets but if this becomes a trend for their pricing then I'm very quickly gonna get priced out of their new releases. I just can't drop 400 a pop on any old item that's an accessory item like a wallet, necklace or ring. 


The most ridiculous thing I'd let them get away with me buying is a 1-2k watch. I saw final fantasy was getting citizen watches and that kingdom hearts was getting 900$ necklaces. I got a lil jelly.
        The work that goes into the prime 1 statue means I'm more okay in the price for that. 

The wallet... 9 month preorder basically meaning a 9 month interest free loan for Square Enix to make a wallet that by no means should come even close to $200 to make / ship / design. It's not even mentioned where it's being produced either. If it's some chinese factory pumping these out the cost is like $10-30 a piece and selling for $470. Insanity.
            Yeah the prime 1 is a no Brainer for its price. This is just immense bullshit pricing. 


The farthest I'd let square enix go and me still buying, is if they made a luxury watch worth a grand or 2. Collectible limited jewelry piece, and would be the highest form of fashionable material/product available for purchase. 

But that's if the quality matches the price or comes close to it. These wallets are the same quality as the card cases that were like 30$. Only difference being size and material. These are to me, 80-100$ at best.
        Yeeeeeah. I was SO excited when I saw these and then the price is like wtf. I can justify the figures and other costly parts of my collection (that I posted on the reddit), but a small wallet for $400 is waaaaaay too much. Like, that thing better not get ruined for /years/ if I were to buy it.
            Thing is, it won't last you your lifetime/years. Only good leather will do that. Genuine leather is just mediocre leather. It's the leather that they slap stuff together with to sell to the folk who don't know what kind of leather is good, and just think "oooohh leather, therefore good". 

If its a wallet, or anything actually for clothing and accessories, you want either top grain cow leather, or vegetable leather. 

Both last a lifetime, cow leather is tougher and is better for things like utility clothing and items, vegetable leather is softer, prettier, and better for fashion clothing. 

Genuine leather is just meh.
WTF that price
    Fucking right?!
        For the same price here in Argentina I can Buy a 2B's figure 😱
made of 2B’s booty cheeks
    Then I wouldn't complain about the price.
    I'll take your entire stock
    I'll take 20.
Each wallet is bathed in the tears of 9S, or so I heard...
At first, I was thinking "I need it" and then I saw the price.
    I was unfortunately riding the high of discovering new cool looking and practical nier merch.

It's been feeling dry for a while for nier merch, but I was out eating, had an order for a supergroupies watch canceled the same morning by coincidence, so had the extra money and I rode the high of the moment too hard and pressed purchase on both.
The fact that you bought it answers your own question, lol. This type of merch is aimed towards a specific group that Squeenix knows will buy anything they throw at them.
    Well im not that crowd then, because there's plenty of stuff of theirs I wouldn't ever buy. I've spent like 10k+ on my NieR collection, but I'm selective at least. 

I guess I just really like what I really like?
Impulsive buyer I guess. 

Praying on people who jump the gun when they see something cool they like.
        Bro you've spent 10k on Nier merch, that's a crazy amount to spend on a franchise. Perhaps I somewhat exaggerated when I said "buy anything" (though I'm sure those people exist too) but my points still stands. There is a clear market for this type of expensive collectors merch and you're living proof of it. That's not meant as a judgement or an insult btw, just so we're clear on that. Im just answering your question and nothing more.

Yeah they're definitely milking the crowd with this overpriced merch, but at the end of the day which side it to blame? If you ask me, I would say both.
            Thing is that these cycles are unfixable. 

It's not a civil rights thing so there's not gonna be some huge protest that changes things. 

There's no "anti square pricing" groups that are picketing outside the office and boycotting. 

Even if I stop, it won't change anything. So I'll just buy the cool shit as long as I can afford it, if it pleases me at least. 


Wanna know the real funny thing about this? Despite my 10k+ collection, I actively choose to stay away from reincarnation knowing that it's a pointless gacha pit. 
Oh and I stayed away from anything vinyl that they released because I know that's an expensive hobby. 
That and vinyl has Lower sound quality than CD/Bluetooth so there's not much of a point. Also inconvenient to store. 

So yeah, selective spender lol. Just unfortunately/fortunately, there's a lot of cool shit I'll sucker up for. Like these wallets. They're pretty neat. Chaching
        I have so much respect for your collection I was just looking online to see comments on this wallet because I was looking to buy it lol I dont have much in my collection but I have immense respect and joy for Nier as a whole.
            I'm surprised to see a comment on an old post of mine. 

Glad you like the collection.
I haven't really shown much of it. My first post is of the prime 1 statue in case you're interested in how the one I got looks. 

Haven't really showed the rest of my collection, but I've got all the supergroupies stuff except the old pod backpacks and the brother nier jacket (still hunting for that thing)
I've got 11 cds, 1 blu ray, some jewelry, some misc official clothes like the 9s leather bag and choker, hoodies and shirts, and I have some fan made hoodies and shirts. 
The collectors editions of both games, a lot of books, aaaand the flare and play arts 2B. 
That's the basic summary of my stuff. 

If you want the best NieR merch, i recommend going hunting for the supergroupies clothing on ebay and buyee.jp, the jewelry square releases, and the soundtracks.

If you're insane like me with NieR + have bad spending habits like me or you have lots of money, then you can't do better than the prime 1 studios statue, and these wallets here are also high high end for nier merch.

Although take it from me, I'm no expert on leather, but these wallets are definitely scams. I know I bought them anyways, but I'm just....like that. I kinda wanted casual NieR wallets for everyday use (even tho I already got the supergroupies wallets)

But here's why these wallets are scams. They're only genuine leather. That's the basic entry level actual leather. So it's not even nice leather. 
I own actual nice leather, specifically a jacket, and it's from supergroupies.
It's the dark souls leather jacket. 480$. So it's way higher quality leather (vegetable tanned leather), with way more leather used (jacket size vs wallet size amount of leather)
And the jacket is also a fashion jacket with motifs of dark souls, and yet the wallet still costs the same amount.


It's a scam, buts it's the kind that a sucker like me will bite on, and if you're like me and got the money AND the addiction to NieR and bad spending habits to match, You'll probably Bite too.
            Which one are you looking to buy? I'm more of a fan of automata than replicant so I bought automatas, but I have the kaine supergroupies clothes which are all blue, and kaine never got a wallet from supergroupies, so I just had to bite the bullet and buy the replicant one too in order to have a matching fit.

As for overall advice on the wallets, nobody has them yet so no advice can be actually given. 
They're really cool, but for the same price you could cop yourself a supergroupies 2B wallet for around 100-200, nab some shoes in your size if you're lucky for around 100-200, or get a jacket or one of the characters watches. 

Just weigh the cost of it against other things NieR that you could get for the same price. 
Keep in mind that supergroupies stuff is more collectible too because they're 1 time releases. 

My last piece of advice for expensive merch shopping, use Japan rabbit to shop on the Japanese square enix site. You'll save so much money. 

Here's a good example. Supergroupies released the bloodborne watch years ago for 300$, people on ebay ask a minimum of 700-800$ for it now. They recently released it in Japan, and using Japan rabbit, it knocked the price down to 230$ from 300$ retail because yen is worth less than $, and after shipping it was only 260$.

Same applies for these wallets. I probably saved over 100$ on these wallets by using Japan rabbit. 

And the best website for aftermarket shopping like ebay, is buyee.jp. They're a center for all kinds of websites that resell stuff. Super useful for quick merch hunting. And it's cheaper than ebay. The Japanese charge less. Same wallet by same seller on buyee vs ebay, buyee has it as 200$, eBay has it for 700$.
Tl;dr: OP harvesting downvotes
    i was like "why?" but then i saw the comment where OP said they bought both wallets lmao
I was also shocked lol, I checked the price for the plushie and that was cheaper. 😆
    Even plushies are too expensive. 50$ is whack for a little stuffy. It's normal even which is worse. 

Bit I'm not nearly as appalled by the stuffies since it's actually fairly normal and expected. This however? Shameful.
damn gucci x nier
    I'd hate that so much.
Hand made by 2B voice actress
    Gotta get that Kira dust on your wallet
Leather is probably pretty expensive in a place that foes not base its agriculture around cows...
    No it's not as nearly as expensive as that. 


Here let me explain.

I bought a vegetable leather dark souls jacket from supergroupies for 480$ retail. 


Now, vegetable leather is as expensive as leather gets without using exotic animal hides. 

It's top quality leather and it's meant for fashion and is much much harder to produce than the majority of all other leathers since it takes a full month to create instead of 1 day. 

Supergroupies is also a Japanese company. But let's be real here, they design the product in japan and outsource it to China. Square does this also for everything. 


So both of these wallets are licensed, and so is the jacket I bought (dark souls IP)

And a jacket is a lot bigger than a wallet, and the jacket is considered a fashion jacket. Not a stay warm jacket. So extra expensive. 

On top of that the jacket has way more intricate detailing and motifs from dark souls than what these wallets have of NieR. 

So, a small wallet made of way cheaper materials, with less details, thats not considered a fashion accessory, is somehow only 10$ cheaper than a fashion jacket, with way higher priced materials, higher cost of labor, more intricate motifs of the respective game, and is more collectible too since it's a 1 time release jacket. 

Square is just robbing.
        Dude... I wasn't really making the claim that it was worth 400.

I do appreciate the effort though.  I hope this does dissuade someone from buying it, but I was already not going to. 

Good day.
They don't need to explain shit
Hikkikomori. That’s your answer.
    I really don't get how that answer correlates to this.
        They are selling these expensive pieces of merchandise to cater to a crowd that they know will buy them regardless of price, the hikkikomori. That’s why so many official anime figurines in general as an example tend to be so expensive, they’re aimed at a market that often has weird obsessions with characters and anime/game series and have disposable income to burn on them.
            Well I googled what the word means it just seems to mean a shut-in who constantly plays video games and watches TV or goes on their phone. Describes me perfectly, but I don't see any description for being a mega fan or having bleedable income.
                nah, they got it wrong. hikikomori is just a shut in. many are weebs, but not every hiki is a weeb/nerd
It looks cheap too. The Square Enix shore has gone to shit. I prefer fan made items on Etsy
Well it's obviously a small wallet so you'll need to lose some of those heavy coins first to be able to use it
Subtract 50 dollars😎
Ugly for the price, and probably will wear off in a year
    Yeah it could use a few pounds of gold and silver for that price, and maybe a kissable set of replica 2B lips right on it. 

And yeah it might depending on how you care for it and the frequency of use. Including these 2 wallets I'm gonna have like 4 wallets, 5 after I buy the 9S wallet of supergroupies. So I can rotate them decently well.
Price for whales / desperate fans, not for ordinary people
    I am admittedly a whale. But even this whale is shocked at this price.
I recommend not buying any merch from the official SE store. Somehow the same merch is sold at a lower price in Asia. I can confirm that's the case for all the music boxes. The ship is another problem though.
    Yeah I don't buy from the official store of the west if I can help it.

I actually bought both of these wallets off of the Japanese store using white rabbit express and instead of paying 470$ before shipping, I paid 440$ AFTER shipping. 


But hey 400+ $ is still 400 + $

Total I saved like 60$ by using white rabbit express, and that's before the shipping, so I probably saved 90-100$
        I used to shop frequently with White Rabbit Express, but still can’t get where the difference in overall costs you are describing came from. Are there such drastic differences in prices between SQEX JP and their west store?
            No white rabbit is just scamming themselves currently. 

Their prices used to hike up what you're paying a lot. 

Now I almost always pay cheaper than retail from Japan. And that's after shipping. 

White rabbit just hasn't adjusted for inflation I guess?
So I admit to having just purchased both of these wallets, but Jesus H christ the price. 

Why 470$? I own the 2B supergroupies wallet and that thing retailed for like 110$ and is a fancier looking wallet. It's a checkbook wallet. 

But this a trifold, and the only reason I can possibly see this as being more expensive by literally 4.5x the amount, is that it's made of genuine leather. While the supergroupies one is faux leather and some other materials. 

But I googled genuine leather wallets and they're like 20$. Same with faux. 

Plus they released the automata and replicant card case a while ago and those weren't nearly as expensive either. Granted they are flimsy little things. 

So square enix. What justifies this nuts price.

For these 2 wallets I just bought, I could've bought the prime 1 2B off of mercari 2nd hand. I just spent 1k almost on 2 wallets. Just.....*sigh*.
    The fucking fact you bought BOTH of them justifies the price. Companies do this because they know consoomers like you will buy it no questions asked. 

>So square enix. What justifies this nuts price

Look in the mirror. You're part of the problem
        What a scam and people buy it, and he bought both of them?! 

I'm just lost here.
        Came to say this lol "how can you justify selling me this because I wanted it badly enough?" 😂 weird flex, if you ask me
        And another reason I don't understand it is because other items do seem reasonable in their price like their jewelery which are usually sub 200$, or their soundtracks which are like 30$-50$ their vinyl which are 100$ as a collection.

It's just a sore thumb sticking out. Everything's prices look okay to me, then there's just these 2. 



Like okay here's a good example using leather and licensed IP. 

Supergroupies dark souls leather jacket. 

It's made of vegetable leather, has intricate stitching on the nape of the jacket, has an interior with multiple motifs of the game and reflective ink for the bonfire. It's also dark souls which is a bigger more lucrative IP than NieR. 

I bought it retail for 480$.

Now a tiny ass wallet that's not even vegetable leather (nice leather), its just genuine leather, and is a wallet instead of a big jacket. Doesn't have that many motifs of the game it's from, is somehow only 10$ cheaper than a vegetable leather jacket, from a much bigger IP.
            You can’t complain when you’re literally the problem bro. They do it because they know you’ll buy it because you have more money than brains when it comes to merch. You’ll see merch, you’ll spend the money, and you’ll keep doing it. It’s the same reason “collectors editions” suck nowadays, including the Nier ones. White Snow for Replicant Remake was alright at best. You can’t make a post like this complaining about the price then be like, “I bought both anyways”. Like bro have some self awareness.
                I am aware of the relationship I create by buying exactly what im complaining about. 

Your reply implies I buy just any merch of NieR, I don't. I have my picks and I have my passes. 

I bought the wallets simply because it looks nice, has been something I've actually been looking forward to for a while, and I had the money to buy said items. But I never expected it to be this ridiculously priced. 

My desire for it outweighs my disgust for the price. Doesn't mean I can't complain about the price despite buying it. 

470$ is objectively ridiculous for anything less than a top quality material wallet. 

The fans don't set the prices first, the business does. And whether or not YOU buy into it, doesn't change that someone else will since there's so many consumers out there, and they are all different people of differing opinions. 


Wanna know what real awareness looks like? Alright. I'm game. 
I'm aware of the fact that the "if I don't, then someone else will" mentality is exactly what causes people to impulsively do things, including buying merch of ridiculous pricing. 
So deciding to buy it because I think not buying it wouldn't change anything, is what then perpetuates the cycle. 

So not buying it is supposed to be the logical choice to end the cycle. Yet I'm also aware that humans despite almost all having this same thought process about "changing themselves", never usually go through with this change, and that not all people will go through with the change just because someone else does. 

In short, I know that since we aren't a hive mind, me boycotting these prices wouldn't change the fact that they'll all sell out anyways. Because others choices are separate from mine, and whales will still whale, impulsive buyers will still jump the gun. So at the end of the day, im gonna buy it. 

Tldr: me boycotting it wouldn't change a single thing, so I'll buy it if I want it. 

And let's be real, this is a relatively small IP, and it doesn't involve any civil issues, so a mass boycotting simply will never happen. People will just either buy it and grumble afterwards, or not buy it and grumble about it being out of their price range.
                    Nier is by no means a “relatively small IP”. Automata had extreme popularity. So much so that it exists on literally EVERY console now and PC. Once again, you and the whales are the problem. As long as you consume it, they’ll price it as high as they want. Cope with that reality all you want but it doesn’t change the fact that they’re literally aiming at YOU with their price points. Whales account for almost ALL spending. They’re literally just trying to milk you because they know you’re dumb enough to fall for it.
                        Yeah no it is a relatively small IP. Big IP is cod, gta, fifa, elder scrolls, red dead, minecraft, fortnite, final fantasy, God of war, halo, horizon, dark souls, bloodborne, elden ring, battlefield, far cry, etc. 

NieR:Automata, and yes specifically Automata, was an out of nowhere smash for what it was. It's launched the IP into the spotlight and into the conversation of jrpgs, Japanese games, and "greatest games ever made" conversations. 

It's critically acclaimed and has a very healthy and steady fanbase, but it's definitely not a big IP. 

And every console is not a claim to fame as a big IP. All kinds of IP nobody gives a shit about are on most platforms. 


Yeah I am part of the problem by being a whale for the franchise, but have you not realized that there is actually no such thing as a franchise where whales collectively stop whaling? Me stopping doesn't cause others to stop. And if stopping is meant to cause change, and the situation is unchangeable since others won't all stop with me, then there's 0 point to stopping except for saving my own money, which I don't really care to do atm. 

Popola said it herself >!it's way too late to stop, no one STOOOOOPS!<
                            No, those are MASSIVE iIP’s. Nier is a large IP. Keep coping for spending almost $1000 on garbage wallets.
                                I just considered massive and large to be the same thing for IPs. Point is, they're big. 

NieR isn't a micro indie IP made in some basement. It's made by a respected and accomplished studio, but it's not exactly on the level of common knowledge in the gaming sphere of conversation.

Nobody ever brings it up in random game conversations, nobody really talks about it outside of the reach of the Fandom. 

You'll at best usually get someone commenting on a video "where Automata at on this list?!?!".

It's made waves with its critical acclaim, but it doesn't have jaw dropping sales or massive support.
It's not exactly on game 10 in the franchise, it's on game 2 and it's impossibly lucky that a 2nd one ever even happened. And only the 2nd one has gotten any real attention. 

And yeah I'll continue to cope about the wallets
                    You answered your own question, then. If you're gonna buy it, you will. And you can clearly afford it, so problem doesn't even effect you like it does to people like most of us who rarely have $470 to their name, and live paycheck to paycheck.
        Oh for sure I know they do it because they can, I'm one heck of a whale for NieR merch. But I'm also sitting her wondering just why now, all of a sudden, for these items specifically, when they aren't exactly all that special or even 1 of a kind for their merch category.

Just for automata alone, supergroupies 2B and 9S wallets, 100$ each, automata card, around 30$ I think, YoRHa phone wallet, idk the actual price because it's cafe exclusive.

Needless to say those are all lower cost items than this, and are of the same type. 

The statue I understand being so dang expensive. It's prime 1. It's a statue. It's a diorama. It's 1/4th. It's polystone. Tack on license fees. And bam I understand the price. 

But these wallets are from no named companies, and not even made from luxury material, and somehow it just jumps to almost 500$?

They could've done this with anything but for some reason these wallets which didn't even need to be made, are somehow more expensive than really rare 1 time release supergroupies wallets? 

It just doesn't make sense.
    Dammmmmnnnn.
    Or in gamer terms, I could've bought like 2 ps5s
If OP thinks this is bad, then wait until he hears about Gucci wallets 😳😳😳
    Oh I know about gucci. That's also a rip off. 

Buy gucci is consistently a rip off. 

Square is decent with its pricing most often, but this is just nuts and out of place. For these 2 wallets you could almost get the prime 1 statue of 2B.
Yeah, itnwould be cringey to sell something like that. Then again it'd sell like crazy. And about how often I'd use it... I'm guessing everyday? It is said men use the same wallet forever until someone gifts us a new one
    I had a pac man wallet from 8th grade until this last Christmas 😂
    Well after these wallets I'd have 4 wallets, and I'll eventually buy the 9S wallet from supergroupies so 5 wallets. I rotate wallets depending on the outfit I go out with
        Gentleman or actually a psychopath 🧐
            Psychotic NieR fan whi dresses nice would be accurate
I thought they put it the wrong price
Seriously, did they put an extra zero on it?
    Fucking right?! 50-80$ max.
There is a world of "luxury" goods where inflated prices have more to do with rich people showing off than the quality of the product. 


Clearest example of this is plain white t-shirts that are sold for 100's of dollars by high-end brands. It's not about the product, it's about the owner saying "be amazed that I can afford to be stupid with my money" 

SE could also be selling other items at a loss, and recouping those losses with items like these.
    Yeah but this isn't exactly Made of real rich people materials. It's not even vegetable leather, and NieR isn't exactly a rich people brand lol. 


My guess is maybe inflation has hurt their business and they just decided to go apeshit on these prices? That's the only excuse aside from "let's abuse some fans"
        It's a luxury leather good. very typical to have sticker shock.
            I mean, it's only luxury based on the price. Luxury goods usually have a material and name behind the brand to explain the bullshit pricing. But this isn't even good leather. Nor is it a fashion company item. 

It's just a bullet in the gut. From square, concerning fans.
                Luxury/exclusivity based on price is exactly the point, yup
Bruh I can make that myself and use the price to buy like 3 NieR figures 💀
Square Enix Moment
You are paying for the brand not the product.
    Most of the stuff they make is reasonably priced. This however is out of nowhere with its pricing. 

Yeah its definitely for the brand this time, but it doesn't make sense because they don't exactly do this normally. Like why haven't they priced the jewelry the same? Or the actual fashion items from supergroupies.

It's just....out of place.
One it's made by Yorha itself and the other protects you from the white chlorination syndrome.
This is ridiculous
    Correct
    It is. OP bought them. Lmao
        Also correct
doesn’t matter, you know it will be sold out, lmao.
    Yeah if people can afford a 3k statue, something like this will last a year maybe.
I’m going to keep an eye on that blue one maybe for a discounted price.
    I got the blue one too because I needed a matching wallet for the kaine outfit.

Blue everything and I pull out a black wallet? No sir. Gimme the brightest, bluest, most kaine looking wallet I can have. 

YoRHa wallet is my preferred one tho cuz automata asthetic supremacy
        I’m trying to stop wearing so much black now as it is. Haha
            My entire wardrobe is black and white, except for the kaine outfit. 

But yeah black and white is my favorite combo thanks to automata. The asthetic man. The YoRHa drip.


I swear of square made a YoRHa clothing line store, I'd go broke. Just broke.
I could buy a Nintendo Switch and then pre-order NieR Automata while still spending less than this wallet costs. Really neat wallet but I wouldn't spend more than $80 for something like this, not six times that amount.
    Yeah its definitely a robbery. If it was vegetable leather or top grain cow leather I could understand a 300$ price tag. Not for this though.
Bruh you could probably pay someone to make one that looks WAAAY better for less.
    I'm a stickler for official stuff. I have a better looking NieR wallet already from supergroupies.

It's the 2B wallet, for 120 retail I think. It's just inconveniently long tho, so I can't take it with me unless I wear a specific jacket, aka the 2B jacket. 

So I bought this for a nice portable official wallet.
        IMO it doesn't matter to me if it's official or not if it looks good.

$470 is steep for a wallet. I buy men's wallets so I don't have the size problem and I don't pay more than $70 for wallets. Anything over $50 is super expensive.

Edit:

Honestly at that price you may as well buy a figure or other merch.
            I like nice looking stuff of course in general 

But when something is a licensed real part of the franchise, it's more special to me. 

The only unofficial stuff I buy is Tshirts really. Square hasn't exactly flooded the t-shirt market for some reason.
Neir automata stuff is insanely priced, same with KH merch.
    Most of it seems fairly priced to me, it's just these wallets are easily the most disgusting offenders on the NieR side of things. Those gold and silver necklaces are robbery for kingdom hearts tho. Sure they're precious metals but they look so bland design wise.
Wallet is small, so you don't need all that money taking up all that space!
    I bought it because i don't have a small portable NieR wallet for everyday use. I have the checkbook 2b wallet, but that's only good for jackets with deep inside pockets for wallets. 

And I bought the blue one because of the kaine outfit I have, and not having any wallets to match it. So I just sucked it up and stomached buying the blue one too.
Square Enix Store is wild price wise. Some stuff is super cheap for it's quality, mostly Figurines and plushs and then there is some jewelry and random items like these wallets that are just insanely expensive.
Really do not get their pricing.
I got the SuperGroupies NieR:A themed design wallet when the collab was out and I paid about 1/3 of that price, and that was already on the expensive side! 50k yen is INSANE
    Yeah i also have the 2B wallet. Got it for retail brand new after it sold out.


The 2B wallet definitely is a lot nicer, and for way less money too.


Unfortunately, it's too big for anything but a wallet pocket inside a jacket, or a bag. So I bit the bullet and paid the money for these 2 wallets so that I have a NieR wallet for everyday use in more casual clothing.
“Glory to Our Fucking Bank Account lmao sweaty nerds”

Keep in mind I myself have a leather YoRHa business card wallet
    Oh right that derpy little card holder. I have it too. I dont really have a use for it considering wallets >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> card holders. The damn thing doesn't even hold that many cards. 

My supergroupies 2B wallet holds more cards. Then again, it is a checkbook wallet.
        It’s not derpy. It’s a business card wallet, it’s not for credit cards or to replace a wallet. The idea is that it looks smart for working professionals when withdrawing a business card for a potential client or when networking. Business cards are much more important in Japan, as well.
            Ah. I just said it's derpy because it's flimsy, floppy. Not that good in terms of materials. A gift shop item almost. 

I just have no use for it personally. Thank goodness it was cheap (relatively).
Chocabo hide
At least 7 animals per item
Real leather from 2B's boots.
All the money I would put in there is spent on the wallets themselves
    They just want to make sure it fits in your pocket! I know *I* couldn't pull off a messenger-style fanny pack as well as 9S does.
        Speaking of his fucking bag, I'm still mega butthurt that his leather bag is sold out. 
Like okay, it's a 300$ bag but it's basically a replica and oh my Jesus it would go so nice with the rest of the NieR fit. 

I've got the 2B handbag, the 9S backpack, now I just need a shoulder sling pack and I'd be complete with the bag drip.....but the only automata shoulder sling bag is the 9S one and it's sold out and never appears on the 2nd hand market. 

Sorry for the rant but I really want that damn bag.
            God, same here. $300 was already too much. I don't know how much more of a ridiculous price I'm willing to throw at that damn bag at this point, but it really does NEVER show up.
                I cant tell you in human language how elated I was to actually be able to find the supergroupies 9S watch online. 

That thing is equally as rare as the bag, maybe rarer, and usually you could expect a super rare highly desired supergroupies watch to sell for like 800 on the second hand market.....bro I got it less than retail brand new. 200$ instead of 220 retail. 

I've been getting such good fucking deals recently it's actually stupid.

I got the Bayonetta watch for like 400$ brand new. Which also goes online 800-1k. Never go with eBay. Always go to some Japanese site. So many swindles.
                    I was just glad I didn't like the watch much. My 9S based outfit so far is the Supergroupies shoes and the official choker, so I feel like I need the bag to finish the look. 

And totally correct about ebay, there are fair odds that if you find that 9S bag on a JP auction and someone is fighting you for it, it's probably me lol. But I wish us both luck on finding it eventually!
                        HEEYYY BUDDDYYYY. Remember this conversation about the 9S shoulder bag?

Heheheh. Well guess whaaaat. I got one BRAND NEW, from ebay......today.......for 680$..... 

It hurt so fucking good. So good. It hurt. So. Good.
                            Daaaaaamnnn!! Congrats!! If you ever come across another, please send a link my way! It was for the best...I bought the 9S PC so I'm still recovering from that this month anyway. Also hurt really good oof
                                Oh yeah I heard those PCs are really pricy for their specs tho. 

I'm actually planning on buying a prebuilt from digital storm for probably 4500-6500$. First PC. Looking to get that 4090 and i9 13900k. But yeah im paying an even bigger premium for them than what square was jabbing people for on their NieR PCS

I'm at least gonna get the PC in NieR colors tho. White cabling and such. 

I'm either going for their velox or their aventum model PC. Both will gut me for money. 

Never used loans or credit before since im young, this PC will probably be my first time I take out a loan for something. 

And yeah if I find a bag I'll shoot a link if I remember. I'll maybe send you some pictures of the bag later, it came in the mail today I think. Maybe a fashion shoot
                        Dang bro you don't like the watch?


Yeah my outfit for 9S has everything now for him except that bag. 

I've got his watch, shoes, boots, backpack, choker (was worried I'd look gay with that one, but it's pretty spiffy imo, in fact I wish they'd make a 2B choker now too with her dress pattern on it)

The only 9S stuff I'm missing besides that bag, is his older supergroupies jacket thats blue, and his old supergroupies chain bracelet watch.
                            Haha, yeah, I'm not really a watch person honestly. Plus, I've been trying to make an effort to not dress so masculinely lately, so I figured adding a men's watch to the mix probably wasn't the move for me. Jealous on the old boots because I couldn't track them down in my size!

The choker is such an interesting piece because even as a woman, I feel kinda weird about how it looks when wearing it normally. I like wearing mine in the bracelet style lol.

As for the chain watch, it may not be the correct one since I didn't click it, but I swear I just saw one on Yahoo Auctions or Mercari JP the other day.
The merch all seemed reasonable to me until these wallets.

Jewelry in the range of 150-240$ is reasonable I think, supergroupies stuff is very reasonably priced, music CDs are like 30-50$, vinyl is like 25$ individual,  100 as a collection, blu ray is like 50-70$, figures are 150-220 (until the latest A2 flare figure)

The only things that are kinda stupid with their price was the plushies and stuffies. Like....50$ for that?! Then again those items are always stupidly expensive and overpriced. 

The most stand out item is the prime 1 statue but that things price is very understandable to me.

Now these wallets on the other hand....so out of left field with the price. Like what are you doing square enix? Obviously making money based on the fact I bought the shits anyways, but like...bro are they alright? Do they think they're some luxury brand now or something? I haven't seen merch this expensive for any franchise. Any. 

I may be able to afford these wallets but if this becomes a trend for their pricing then I'm very quickly gonna get priced out of their new releases. I just can't drop 400 a pop on any old item that's an accessory item like a wallet, necklace or ring. 


The most ridiculous thing I'd let them get away with me buying is a 1-2k watch. I saw final fantasy was getting citizen watches and that kingdom hearts was getting 900$ necklaces. I got a lil jelly.
    The work that goes into the prime 1 statue means I'm more okay in the price for that. 

The wallet... 9 month preorder basically meaning a 9 month interest free loan for Square Enix to make a wallet that by no means should come even close to $200 to make / ship / design. It's not even mentioned where it's being produced either. If it's some chinese factory pumping these out the cost is like $10-30 a piece and selling for $470. Insanity.
        Yeah the prime 1 is a no Brainer for its price. This is just immense bullshit pricing. 


The farthest I'd let square enix go and me still buying, is if they made a luxury watch worth a grand or 2. Collectible limited jewelry piece, and would be the highest form of fashionable material/product available for purchase. 

But that's if the quality matches the price or comes close to it. These wallets are the same quality as the card cases that were like 30$. Only difference being size and material. These are to me, 80-100$ at best.
    Yeeeeeah. I was SO excited when I saw these and then the price is like wtf. I can justify the figures and other costly parts of my collection (that I posted on the reddit), but a small wallet for $400 is waaaaaay too much. Like, that thing better not get ruined for /years/ if I were to buy it.
        Thing is, it won't last you your lifetime/years. Only good leather will do that. Genuine leather is just mediocre leather. It's the leather that they slap stuff together with to sell to the folk who don't know what kind of leather is good, and just think "oooohh leather, therefore good". 

If its a wallet, or anything actually for clothing and accessories, you want either top grain cow leather, or vegetable leather. 

Both last a lifetime, cow leather is tougher and is better for things like utility clothing and items, vegetable leather is softer, prettier, and better for fashion clothing. 

Genuine leather is just meh.
Fucking right?!
    For the same price here in Argentina I can Buy a 2B's figure 😱
Then I wouldn't complain about the price.
I'll take your entire stock
I'll take 20.
I was unfortunately riding the high of discovering new cool looking and practical nier merch.

It's been feeling dry for a while for nier merch, but I was out eating, had an order for a supergroupies watch canceled the same morning by coincidence, so had the extra money and I rode the high of the moment too hard and pressed purchase on both.
Well im not that crowd then, because there's plenty of stuff of theirs I wouldn't ever buy. I've spent like 10k+ on my NieR collection, but I'm selective at least. 

I guess I just really like what I really like?
Impulsive buyer I guess. 

Praying on people who jump the gun when they see something cool they like.
    Bro you've spent 10k on Nier merch, that's a crazy amount to spend on a franchise. Perhaps I somewhat exaggerated when I said "buy anything" (though I'm sure those people exist too) but my points still stands. There is a clear market for this type of expensive collectors merch and you're living proof of it. That's not meant as a judgement or an insult btw, just so we're clear on that. Im just answering your question and nothing more.

Yeah they're definitely milking the crowd with this overpriced merch, but at the end of the day which side it to blame? If you ask me, I would say both.
        Thing is that these cycles are unfixable. 

It's not a civil rights thing so there's not gonna be some huge protest that changes things. 

There's no "anti square pricing" groups that are picketing outside the office and boycotting. 

Even if I stop, it won't change anything. So I'll just buy the cool shit as long as I can afford it, if it pleases me at least. 


Wanna know the real funny thing about this? Despite my 10k+ collection, I actively choose to stay away from reincarnation knowing that it's a pointless gacha pit. 
Oh and I stayed away from anything vinyl that they released because I know that's an expensive hobby. 
That and vinyl has Lower sound quality than CD/Bluetooth so there's not much of a point. Also inconvenient to store. 

So yeah, selective spender lol. Just unfortunately/fortunately, there's a lot of cool shit I'll sucker up for. Like these wallets. They're pretty neat. Chaching
    I have so much respect for your collection I was just looking online to see comments on this wallet because I was looking to buy it lol I dont have much in my collection but I have immense respect and joy for Nier as a whole.
        I'm surprised to see a comment on an old post of mine. 

Glad you like the collection.
I haven't really shown much of it. My first post is of the prime 1 statue in case you're interested in how the one I got looks. 

Haven't really showed the rest of my collection, but I've got all the supergroupies stuff except the old pod backpacks and the brother nier jacket (still hunting for that thing)
I've got 11 cds, 1 blu ray, some jewelry, some misc official clothes like the 9s leather bag and choker, hoodies and shirts, and I have some fan made hoodies and shirts. 
The collectors editions of both games, a lot of books, aaaand the flare and play arts 2B. 
That's the basic summary of my stuff. 

If you want the best NieR merch, i recommend going hunting for the supergroupies clothing on ebay and buyee.jp, the jewelry square releases, and the soundtracks.

If you're insane like me with NieR + have bad spending habits like me or you have lots of money, then you can't do better than the prime 1 studios statue, and these wallets here are also high high end for nier merch.

Although take it from me, I'm no expert on leather, but these wallets are definitely scams. I know I bought them anyways, but I'm just....like that. I kinda wanted casual NieR wallets for everyday use (even tho I already got the supergroupies wallets)

But here's why these wallets are scams. They're only genuine leather. That's the basic entry level actual leather. So it's not even nice leather. 
I own actual nice leather, specifically a jacket, and it's from supergroupies.
It's the dark souls leather jacket. 480$. So it's way higher quality leather (vegetable tanned leather), with way more leather used (jacket size vs wallet size amount of leather)
And the jacket is also a fashion jacket with motifs of dark souls, and yet the wallet still costs the same amount.


It's a scam, buts it's the kind that a sucker like me will bite on, and if you're like me and got the money AND the addiction to NieR and bad spending habits to match, You'll probably Bite too.
        Which one are you looking to buy? I'm more of a fan of automata than replicant so I bought automatas, but I have the kaine supergroupies clothes which are all blue, and kaine never got a wallet from supergroupies, so I just had to bite the bullet and buy the replicant one too in order to have a matching fit.

As for overall advice on the wallets, nobody has them yet so no advice can be actually given. 
They're really cool, but for the same price you could cop yourself a supergroupies 2B wallet for around 100-200, nab some shoes in your size if you're lucky for around 100-200, or get a jacket or one of the characters watches. 

Just weigh the cost of it against other things NieR that you could get for the same price. 
Keep in mind that supergroupies stuff is more collectible too because they're 1 time releases. 

My last piece of advice for expensive merch shopping, use Japan rabbit to shop on the Japanese square enix site. You'll save so much money. 

Here's a good example. Supergroupies released the bloodborne watch years ago for 300$, people on ebay ask a minimum of 700-800$ for it now. They recently released it in Japan, and using Japan rabbit, it knocked the price down to 230$ from 300$ retail because yen is worth less than $, and after shipping it was only 260$.

Same applies for these wallets. I probably saved over 100$ on these wallets by using Japan rabbit. 

And the best website for aftermarket shopping like ebay, is buyee.jp. They're a center for all kinds of websites that resell stuff. Super useful for quick merch hunting. And it's cheaper than ebay. The Japanese charge less. Same wallet by same seller on buyee vs ebay, buyee has it as 200$, eBay has it for 700$.
i was like "why?" but then i saw the comment where OP said they bought both wallets lmao
Even plushies are too expensive. 50$ is whack for a little stuffy. It's normal even which is worse. 

Bit I'm not nearly as appalled by the stuffies since it's actually fairly normal and expected. This however? Shameful.
I'd hate that so much.
Gotta get that Kira dust on your wallet
No it's not as nearly as expensive as that. 


Here let me explain.

I bought a vegetable leather dark souls jacket from supergroupies for 480$ retail. 


Now, vegetable leather is as expensive as leather gets without using exotic animal hides. 

It's top quality leather and it's meant for fashion and is much much harder to produce than the majority of all other leathers since it takes a full month to create instead of 1 day. 

Supergroupies is also a Japanese company. But let's be real here, they design the product in japan and outsource it to China. Square does this also for everything. 


So both of these wallets are licensed, and so is the jacket I bought (dark souls IP)

And a jacket is a lot bigger than a wallet, and the jacket is considered a fashion jacket. Not a stay warm jacket. So extra expensive. 

On top of that the jacket has way more intricate detailing and motifs from dark souls than what these wallets have of NieR. 

So, a small wallet made of way cheaper materials, with less details, thats not considered a fashion accessory, is somehow only 10$ cheaper than a fashion jacket, with way higher priced materials, higher cost of labor, more intricate motifs of the respective game, and is more collectible too since it's a 1 time release jacket. 

Square is just robbing.
    Dude... I wasn't really making the claim that it was worth 400.

I do appreciate the effort though.  I hope this does dissuade someone from buying it, but I was already not going to. 

Good day.
I really don't get how that answer correlates to this.
    They are selling these expensive pieces of merchandise to cater to a crowd that they know will buy them regardless of price, the hikkikomori. That’s why so many official anime figurines in general as an example tend to be so expensive, they’re aimed at a market that often has weird obsessions with characters and anime/game series and have disposable income to burn on them.
        Well I googled what the word means it just seems to mean a shut-in who constantly plays video games and watches TV or goes on their phone. Describes me perfectly, but I don't see any description for being a mega fan or having bleedable income.
            nah, they got it wrong. hikikomori is just a shut in. many are weebs, but not every hiki is a weeb/nerd
Yeah it could use a few pounds of gold and silver for that price, and maybe a kissable set of replica 2B lips right on it. 

And yeah it might depending on how you care for it and the frequency of use. Including these 2 wallets I'm gonna have like 4 wallets, 5 after I buy the 9S wallet of supergroupies. So I can rotate them decently well.
I am admittedly a whale. But even this whale is shocked at this price.
Yeah I don't buy from the official store of the west if I can help it.

I actually bought both of these wallets off of the Japanese store using white rabbit express and instead of paying 470$ before shipping, I paid 440$ AFTER shipping. 


But hey 400+ $ is still 400 + $

Total I saved like 60$ by using white rabbit express, and that's before the shipping, so I probably saved 90-100$
    I used to shop frequently with White Rabbit Express, but still can’t get where the difference in overall costs you are describing came from. Are there such drastic differences in prices between SQEX JP and their west store?
        No white rabbit is just scamming themselves currently. 

Their prices used to hike up what you're paying a lot. 

Now I almost always pay cheaper than retail from Japan. And that's after shipping. 

White rabbit just hasn't adjusted for inflation I guess?
The fucking fact you bought BOTH of them justifies the price. Companies do this because they know consoomers like you will buy it no questions asked. 

>So square enix. What justifies this nuts price

Look in the mirror. You're part of the problem
    What a scam and people buy it, and he bought both of them?! 

I'm just lost here.
    Came to say this lol "how can you justify selling me this because I wanted it badly enough?" 😂 weird flex, if you ask me
    And another reason I don't understand it is because other items do seem reasonable in their price like their jewelery which are usually sub 200$, or their soundtracks which are like 30$-50$ their vinyl which are 100$ as a collection.

It's just a sore thumb sticking out. Everything's prices look okay to me, then there's just these 2. 



Like okay here's a good example using leather and licensed IP. 

Supergroupies dark souls leather jacket. 

It's made of vegetable leather, has intricate stitching on the nape of the jacket, has an interior with multiple motifs of the game and reflective ink for the bonfire. It's also dark souls which is a bigger more lucrative IP than NieR. 

I bought it retail for 480$.

Now a tiny ass wallet that's not even vegetable leather (nice leather), its just genuine leather, and is a wallet instead of a big jacket. Doesn't have that many motifs of the game it's from, is somehow only 10$ cheaper than a vegetable leather jacket, from a much bigger IP.
        You can’t complain when you’re literally the problem bro. They do it because they know you’ll buy it because you have more money than brains when it comes to merch. You’ll see merch, you’ll spend the money, and you’ll keep doing it. It’s the same reason “collectors editions” suck nowadays, including the Nier ones. White Snow for Replicant Remake was alright at best. You can’t make a post like this complaining about the price then be like, “I bought both anyways”. Like bro have some self awareness.
            I am aware of the relationship I create by buying exactly what im complaining about. 

Your reply implies I buy just any merch of NieR, I don't. I have my picks and I have my passes. 

I bought the wallets simply because it looks nice, has been something I've actually been looking forward to for a while, and I had the money to buy said items. But I never expected it to be this ridiculously priced. 

My desire for it outweighs my disgust for the price. Doesn't mean I can't complain about the price despite buying it. 

470$ is objectively ridiculous for anything less than a top quality material wallet. 

The fans don't set the prices first, the business does. And whether or not YOU buy into it, doesn't change that someone else will since there's so many consumers out there, and they are all different people of differing opinions. 


Wanna know what real awareness looks like? Alright. I'm game. 
I'm aware of the fact that the "if I don't, then someone else will" mentality is exactly what causes people to impulsively do things, including buying merch of ridiculous pricing. 
So deciding to buy it because I think not buying it wouldn't change anything, is what then perpetuates the cycle. 

So not buying it is supposed to be the logical choice to end the cycle. Yet I'm also aware that humans despite almost all having this same thought process about "changing themselves", never usually go through with this change, and that not all people will go through with the change just because someone else does. 

In short, I know that since we aren't a hive mind, me boycotting these prices wouldn't change the fact that they'll all sell out anyways. Because others choices are separate from mine, and whales will still whale, impulsive buyers will still jump the gun. So at the end of the day, im gonna buy it. 

Tldr: me boycotting it wouldn't change a single thing, so I'll buy it if I want it. 

And let's be real, this is a relatively small IP, and it doesn't involve any civil issues, so a mass boycotting simply will never happen. People will just either buy it and grumble afterwards, or not buy it and grumble about it being out of their price range.
                Nier is by no means a “relatively small IP”. Automata had extreme popularity. So much so that it exists on literally EVERY console now and PC. Once again, you and the whales are the problem. As long as you consume it, they’ll price it as high as they want. Cope with that reality all you want but it doesn’t change the fact that they’re literally aiming at YOU with their price points. Whales account for almost ALL spending. They’re literally just trying to milk you because they know you’re dumb enough to fall for it.
                    Yeah no it is a relatively small IP. Big IP is cod, gta, fifa, elder scrolls, red dead, minecraft, fortnite, final fantasy, God of war, halo, horizon, dark souls, bloodborne, elden ring, battlefield, far cry, etc. 

NieR:Automata, and yes specifically Automata, was an out of nowhere smash for what it was. It's launched the IP into the spotlight and into the conversation of jrpgs, Japanese games, and "greatest games ever made" conversations. 

It's critically acclaimed and has a very healthy and steady fanbase, but it's definitely not a big IP. 

And every console is not a claim to fame as a big IP. All kinds of IP nobody gives a shit about are on most platforms. 


Yeah I am part of the problem by being a whale for the franchise, but have you not realized that there is actually no such thing as a franchise where whales collectively stop whaling? Me stopping doesn't cause others to stop. And if stopping is meant to cause change, and the situation is unchangeable since others won't all stop with me, then there's 0 point to stopping except for saving my own money, which I don't really care to do atm. 

Popola said it herself >!it's way too late to stop, no one STOOOOOPS!<
                        No, those are MASSIVE iIP’s. Nier is a large IP. Keep coping for spending almost $1000 on garbage wallets.
                            I just considered massive and large to be the same thing for IPs. Point is, they're big. 

NieR isn't a micro indie IP made in some basement. It's made by a respected and accomplished studio, but it's not exactly on the level of common knowledge in the gaming sphere of conversation.

Nobody ever brings it up in random game conversations, nobody really talks about it outside of the reach of the Fandom. 

You'll at best usually get someone commenting on a video "where Automata at on this list?!?!".

It's made waves with its critical acclaim, but it doesn't have jaw dropping sales or massive support.
It's not exactly on game 10 in the franchise, it's on game 2 and it's impossibly lucky that a 2nd one ever even happened. And only the 2nd one has gotten any real attention. 

And yeah I'll continue to cope about the wallets
                You answered your own question, then. If you're gonna buy it, you will. And you can clearly afford it, so problem doesn't even effect you like it does to people like most of us who rarely have $470 to their name, and live paycheck to paycheck.
    Oh for sure I know they do it because they can, I'm one heck of a whale for NieR merch. But I'm also sitting her wondering just why now, all of a sudden, for these items specifically, when they aren't exactly all that special or even 1 of a kind for their merch category.

Just for automata alone, supergroupies 2B and 9S wallets, 100$ each, automata card, around 30$ I think, YoRHa phone wallet, idk the actual price because it's cafe exclusive.

Needless to say those are all lower cost items than this, and are of the same type. 

The statue I understand being so dang expensive. It's prime 1. It's a statue. It's a diorama. It's 1/4th. It's polystone. Tack on license fees. And bam I understand the price. 

But these wallets are from no named companies, and not even made from luxury material, and somehow it just jumps to almost 500$?

They could've done this with anything but for some reason these wallets which didn't even need to be made, are somehow more expensive than really rare 1 time release supergroupies wallets? 

It just doesn't make sense.
Dammmmmnnnn.
Or in gamer terms, I could've bought like 2 ps5s
Oh I know about gucci. That's also a rip off. 

Buy gucci is consistently a rip off. 

Square is decent with its pricing most often, but this is just nuts and out of place. For these 2 wallets you could almost get the prime 1 statue of 2B.
I had a pac man wallet from 8th grade until this last Christmas 😂
Well after these wallets I'd have 4 wallets, and I'll eventually buy the 9S wallet from supergroupies so 5 wallets. I rotate wallets depending on the outfit I go out with
    Gentleman or actually a psychopath 🧐
        Psychotic NieR fan whi dresses nice would be accurate
Fucking right?! 50-80$ max.
Yeah but this isn't exactly Made of real rich people materials. It's not even vegetable leather, and NieR isn't exactly a rich people brand lol. 


My guess is maybe inflation has hurt their business and they just decided to go apeshit on these prices? That's the only excuse aside from "let's abuse some fans"
    It's a luxury leather good. very typical to have sticker shock.
        I mean, it's only luxury based on the price. Luxury goods usually have a material and name behind the brand to explain the bullshit pricing. But this isn't even good leather. Nor is it a fashion company item. 

It's just a bullet in the gut. From square, concerning fans.
            Luxury/exclusivity based on price is exactly the point, yup
Most of the stuff they make is reasonably priced. This however is out of nowhere with its pricing. 

Yeah its definitely for the brand this time, but it doesn't make sense because they don't exactly do this normally. Like why haven't they priced the jewelry the same? Or the actual fashion items from supergroupies.

It's just....out of place.
Correct
It is. OP bought them. Lmao
    Also correct
Yeah if people can afford a 3k statue, something like this will last a year maybe.
I got the blue one too because I needed a matching wallet for the kaine outfit.

Blue everything and I pull out a black wallet? No sir. Gimme the brightest, bluest, most kaine looking wallet I can have. 

YoRHa wallet is my preferred one tho cuz automata asthetic supremacy
    I’m trying to stop wearing so much black now as it is. Haha
        My entire wardrobe is black and white, except for the kaine outfit. 

But yeah black and white is my favorite combo thanks to automata. The asthetic man. The YoRHa drip.


I swear of square made a YoRHa clothing line store, I'd go broke. Just broke.
Yeah its definitely a robbery. If it was vegetable leather or top grain cow leather I could understand a 300$ price tag. Not for this though.
I'm a stickler for official stuff. I have a better looking NieR wallet already from supergroupies.

It's the 2B wallet, for 120 retail I think. It's just inconveniently long tho, so I can't take it with me unless I wear a specific jacket, aka the 2B jacket. 

So I bought this for a nice portable official wallet.
    IMO it doesn't matter to me if it's official or not if it looks good.

$470 is steep for a wallet. I buy men's wallets so I don't have the size problem and I don't pay more than $70 for wallets. Anything over $50 is super expensive.

Edit:

Honestly at that price you may as well buy a figure or other merch.
        I like nice looking stuff of course in general 

But when something is a licensed real part of the franchise, it's more special to me. 

The only unofficial stuff I buy is Tshirts really. Square hasn't exactly flooded the t-shirt market for some reason.
Most of it seems fairly priced to me, it's just these wallets are easily the most disgusting offenders on the NieR side of things. Those gold and silver necklaces are robbery for kingdom hearts tho. Sure they're precious metals but they look so bland design wise.
I bought it because i don't have a small portable NieR wallet for everyday use. I have the checkbook 2b wallet, but that's only good for jackets with deep inside pockets for wallets. 

And I bought the blue one because of the kaine outfit I have, and not having any wallets to match it. So I just sucked it up and stomached buying the blue one too.
Yeah i also have the 2B wallet. Got it for retail brand new after it sold out.


The 2B wallet definitely is a lot nicer, and for way less money too.


Unfortunately, it's too big for anything but a wallet pocket inside a jacket, or a bag. So I bit the bullet and paid the money for these 2 wallets so that I have a NieR wallet for everyday use in more casual clothing.
Oh right that derpy little card holder. I have it too. I dont really have a use for it considering wallets >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> card holders. The damn thing doesn't even hold that many cards. 

My supergroupies 2B wallet holds more cards. Then again, it is a checkbook wallet.
    It’s not derpy. It’s a business card wallet, it’s not for credit cards or to replace a wallet. The idea is that it looks smart for working professionals when withdrawing a business card for a potential client or when networking. Business cards are much more important in Japan, as well.
        Ah. I just said it's derpy because it's flimsy, floppy. Not that good in terms of materials. A gift shop item almost. 

I just have no use for it personally. Thank goodness it was cheap (relatively).
They just want to make sure it fits in your pocket! I know *I* couldn't pull off a messenger-style fanny pack as well as 9S does.
    Speaking of his fucking bag, I'm still mega butthurt that his leather bag is sold out. 
Like okay, it's a 300$ bag but it's basically a replica and oh my Jesus it would go so nice with the rest of the NieR fit. 

I've got the 2B handbag, the 9S backpack, now I just need a shoulder sling pack and I'd be complete with the bag drip.....but the only automata shoulder sling bag is the 9S one and it's sold out and never appears on the 2nd hand market. 

Sorry for the rant but I really want that damn bag.
        God, same here. $300 was already too much. I don't know how much more of a ridiculous price I'm willing to throw at that damn bag at this point, but it really does NEVER show up.
            I cant tell you in human language how elated I was to actually be able to find the supergroupies 9S watch online. 

That thing is equally as rare as the bag, maybe rarer, and usually you could expect a super rare highly desired supergroupies watch to sell for like 800 on the second hand market.....bro I got it less than retail brand new. 200$ instead of 220 retail. 

I've been getting such good fucking deals recently it's actually stupid.

I got the Bayonetta watch for like 400$ brand new. Which also goes online 800-1k. Never go with eBay. Always go to some Japanese site. So many swindles.
                I was just glad I didn't like the watch much. My 9S based outfit so far is the Supergroupies shoes and the official choker, so I feel like I need the bag to finish the look. 

And totally correct about ebay, there are fair odds that if you find that 9S bag on a JP auction and someone is fighting you for it, it's probably me lol. But I wish us both luck on finding it eventually!
                    HEEYYY BUDDDYYYY. Remember this conversation about the 9S shoulder bag?

Heheheh. Well guess whaaaat. I got one BRAND NEW, from ebay......today.......for 680$..... 

It hurt so fucking good. So good. It hurt. So. Good.
                        Daaaaaamnnn!! Congrats!! If you ever come across another, please send a link my way! It was for the best...I bought the 9S PC so I'm still recovering from that this month anyway. Also hurt really good oof
                            Oh yeah I heard those PCs are really pricy for their specs tho. 

I'm actually planning on buying a prebuilt from digital storm for probably 4500-6500$. First PC. Looking to get that 4090 and i9 13900k. But yeah im paying an even bigger premium for them than what square was jabbing people for on their NieR PCS

I'm at least gonna get the PC in NieR colors tho. White cabling and such. 

I'm either going for their velox or their aventum model PC. Both will gut me for money. 

Never used loans or credit before since im young, this PC will probably be my first time I take out a loan for something. 

And yeah if I find a bag I'll shoot a link if I remember. I'll maybe send you some pictures of the bag later, it came in the mail today I think. Maybe a fashion shoot
                    Dang bro you don't like the watch?


Yeah my outfit for 9S has everything now for him except that bag. 

I've got his watch, shoes, boots, backpack, choker (was worried I'd look gay with that one, but it's pretty spiffy imo, in fact I wish they'd make a 2B choker now too with her dress pattern on it)

The only 9S stuff I'm missing besides that bag, is his older supergroupies jacket thats blue, and his old supergroupies chain bracelet watch.
                        Haha, yeah, I'm not really a watch person honestly. Plus, I've been trying to make an effort to not dress so masculinely lately, so I figured adding a men's watch to the mix probably wasn't the move for me. Jealous on the old boots because I couldn't track them down in my size!

The choker is such an interesting piece because even as a woman, I feel kinda weird about how it looks when wearing it normally. I like wearing mine in the bracelet style lol.

As for the chain watch, it may not be the correct one since I didn't click it, but I swear I just saw one on Yahoo Auctions or Mercari JP the other day.
The work that goes into the prime 1 statue means I'm more okay in the price for that. 

The wallet... 9 month preorder basically meaning a 9 month interest free loan for Square Enix to make a wallet that by no means should come even close to $200 to make / ship / design. It's not even mentioned where it's being produced either. If it's some chinese factory pumping these out the cost is like $10-30 a piece and selling for $470. Insanity.
    Yeah the prime 1 is a no Brainer for its price. This is just immense bullshit pricing. 


The farthest I'd let square enix go and me still buying, is if they made a luxury watch worth a grand or 2. Collectible limited jewelry piece, and would be the highest form of fashionable material/product available for purchase. 

But that's if the quality matches the price or comes close to it. These wallets are the same quality as the card cases that were like 30$. Only difference being size and material. These are to me, 80-100$ at best.
Yeeeeeah. I was SO excited when I saw these and then the price is like wtf. I can justify the figures and other costly parts of my collection (that I posted on the reddit), but a small wallet for $400 is waaaaaay too much. Like, that thing better not get ruined for /years/ if I were to buy it.
    Thing is, it won't last you your lifetime/years. Only good leather will do that. Genuine leather is just mediocre leather. It's the leather that they slap stuff together with to sell to the folk who don't know what kind of leather is good, and just think "oooohh leather, therefore good". 

If its a wallet, or anything actually for clothing and accessories, you want either top grain cow leather, or vegetable leather. 

Both last a lifetime, cow leather is tougher and is better for things like utility clothing and items, vegetable leather is softer, prettier, and better for fashion clothing. 

Genuine leather is just meh.
For the same price here in Argentina I can Buy a 2B's figure 😱
Bro you've spent 10k on Nier merch, that's a crazy amount to spend on a franchise. Perhaps I somewhat exaggerated when I said "buy anything" (though I'm sure those people exist too) but my points still stands. There is a clear market for this type of expensive collectors merch and you're living proof of it. That's not meant as a judgement or an insult btw, just so we're clear on that. Im just answering your question and nothing more.

Yeah they're definitely milking the crowd with this overpriced merch, but at the end of the day which side it to blame? If you ask me, I would say both.
    Thing is that these cycles are unfixable. 

It's not a civil rights thing so there's not gonna be some huge protest that changes things. 

There's no "anti square pricing" groups that are picketing outside the office and boycotting. 

Even if I stop, it won't change anything. So I'll just buy the cool shit as long as I can afford it, if it pleases me at least. 


Wanna know the real funny thing about this? Despite my 10k+ collection, I actively choose to stay away from reincarnation knowing that it's a pointless gacha pit. 
Oh and I stayed away from anything vinyl that they released because I know that's an expensive hobby. 
That and vinyl has Lower sound quality than CD/Bluetooth so there's not much of a point. Also inconvenient to store. 

So yeah, selective spender lol. Just unfortunately/fortunately, there's a lot of cool shit I'll sucker up for. Like these wallets. They're pretty neat. Chaching
I have so much respect for your collection I was just looking online to see comments on this wallet because I was looking to buy it lol I dont have much in my collection but I have immense respect and joy for Nier as a whole.
    I'm surprised to see a comment on an old post of mine. 

Glad you like the collection.
I haven't really shown much of it. My first post is of the prime 1 statue in case you're interested in how the one I got looks. 

Haven't really showed the rest of my collection, but I've got all the supergroupies stuff except the old pod backpacks and the brother nier jacket (still hunting for that thing)
I've got 11 cds, 1 blu ray, some jewelry, some misc official clothes like the 9s leather bag and choker, hoodies and shirts, and I have some fan made hoodies and shirts. 
The collectors editions of both games, a lot of books, aaaand the flare and play arts 2B. 
That's the basic summary of my stuff. 

If you want the best NieR merch, i recommend going hunting for the supergroupies clothing on ebay and buyee.jp, the jewelry square releases, and the soundtracks.

If you're insane like me with NieR + have bad spending habits like me or you have lots of money, then you can't do better than the prime 1 studios statue, and these wallets here are also high high end for nier merch.

Although take it from me, I'm no expert on leather, but these wallets are definitely scams. I know I bought them anyways, but I'm just....like that. I kinda wanted casual NieR wallets for everyday use (even tho I already got the supergroupies wallets)

But here's why these wallets are scams. They're only genuine leather. That's the basic entry level actual leather. So it's not even nice leather. 
I own actual nice leather, specifically a jacket, and it's from supergroupies.
It's the dark souls leather jacket. 480$. So it's way higher quality leather (vegetable tanned leather), with way more leather used (jacket size vs wallet size amount of leather)
And the jacket is also a fashion jacket with motifs of dark souls, and yet the wallet still costs the same amount.


It's a scam, buts it's the kind that a sucker like me will bite on, and if you're like me and got the money AND the addiction to NieR and bad spending habits to match, You'll probably Bite too.
    Which one are you looking to buy? I'm more of a fan of automata than replicant so I bought automatas, but I have the kaine supergroupies clothes which are all blue, and kaine never got a wallet from supergroupies, so I just had to bite the bullet and buy the replicant one too in order to have a matching fit.

As for overall advice on the wallets, nobody has them yet so no advice can be actually given. 
They're really cool, but for the same price you could cop yourself a supergroupies 2B wallet for around 100-200, nab some shoes in your size if you're lucky for around 100-200, or get a jacket or one of the characters watches. 

Just weigh the cost of it against other things NieR that you could get for the same price. 
Keep in mind that supergroupies stuff is more collectible too because they're 1 time releases. 

My last piece of advice for expensive merch shopping, use Japan rabbit to shop on the Japanese square enix site. You'll save so much money. 

Here's a good example. Supergroupies released the bloodborne watch years ago for 300$, people on ebay ask a minimum of 700-800$ for it now. They recently released it in Japan, and using Japan rabbit, it knocked the price down to 230$ from 300$ retail because yen is worth less than $, and after shipping it was only 260$.

Same applies for these wallets. I probably saved over 100$ on these wallets by using Japan rabbit. 

And the best website for aftermarket shopping like ebay, is buyee.jp. They're a center for all kinds of websites that resell stuff. Super useful for quick merch hunting. And it's cheaper than ebay. The Japanese charge less. Same wallet by same seller on buyee vs ebay, buyee has it as 200$, eBay has it for 700$.
Dude... I wasn't really making the claim that it was worth 400.

I do appreciate the effort though.  I hope this does dissuade someone from buying it, but I was already not going to. 

Good day.
They are selling these expensive pieces of merchandise to cater to a crowd that they know will buy them regardless of price, the hikkikomori. That’s why so many official anime figurines in general as an example tend to be so expensive, they’re aimed at a market that often has weird obsessions with characters and anime/game series and have disposable income to burn on them.
    Well I googled what the word means it just seems to mean a shut-in who constantly plays video games and watches TV or goes on their phone. Describes me perfectly, but I don't see any description for being a mega fan or having bleedable income.
        nah, they got it wrong. hikikomori is just a shut in. many are weebs, but not every hiki is a weeb/nerd
I used to shop frequently with White Rabbit Express, but still can’t get where the difference in overall costs you are describing came from. Are there such drastic differences in prices between SQEX JP and their west store?
    No white rabbit is just scamming themselves currently. 

Their prices used to hike up what you're paying a lot. 

Now I almost always pay cheaper than retail from Japan. And that's after shipping. 

White rabbit just hasn't adjusted for inflation I guess?
What a scam and people buy it, and he bought both of them?! 

I'm just lost here.
Came to say this lol "how can you justify selling me this because I wanted it badly enough?" 😂 weird flex, if you ask me
And another reason I don't understand it is because other items do seem reasonable in their price like their jewelery which are usually sub 200$, or their soundtracks which are like 30$-50$ their vinyl which are 100$ as a collection.

It's just a sore thumb sticking out. Everything's prices look okay to me, then there's just these 2. 



Like okay here's a good example using leather and licensed IP. 

Supergroupies dark souls leather jacket. 

It's made of vegetable leather, has intricate stitching on the nape of the jacket, has an interior with multiple motifs of the game and reflective ink for the bonfire. It's also dark souls which is a bigger more lucrative IP than NieR. 

I bought it retail for 480$.

Now a tiny ass wallet that's not even vegetable leather (nice leather), its just genuine leather, and is a wallet instead of a big jacket. Doesn't have that many motifs of the game it's from, is somehow only 10$ cheaper than a vegetable leather jacket, from a much bigger IP.
    You can’t complain when you’re literally the problem bro. They do it because they know you’ll buy it because you have more money than brains when it comes to merch. You’ll see merch, you’ll spend the money, and you’ll keep doing it. It’s the same reason “collectors editions” suck nowadays, including the Nier ones. White Snow for Replicant Remake was alright at best. You can’t make a post like this complaining about the price then be like, “I bought both anyways”. Like bro have some self awareness.
        I am aware of the relationship I create by buying exactly what im complaining about. 

Your reply implies I buy just any merch of NieR, I don't. I have my picks and I have my passes. 

I bought the wallets simply because it looks nice, has been something I've actually been looking forward to for a while, and I had the money to buy said items. But I never expected it to be this ridiculously priced. 

My desire for it outweighs my disgust for the price. Doesn't mean I can't complain about the price despite buying it. 

470$ is objectively ridiculous for anything less than a top quality material wallet. 

The fans don't set the prices first, the business does. And whether or not YOU buy into it, doesn't change that someone else will since there's so many consumers out there, and they are all different people of differing opinions. 


Wanna know what real awareness looks like? Alright. I'm game. 
I'm aware of the fact that the "if I don't, then someone else will" mentality is exactly what causes people to impulsively do things, including buying merch of ridiculous pricing. 
So deciding to buy it because I think not buying it wouldn't change anything, is what then perpetuates the cycle. 

So not buying it is supposed to be the logical choice to end the cycle. Yet I'm also aware that humans despite almost all having this same thought process about "changing themselves", never usually go through with this change, and that not all people will go through with the change just because someone else does. 

In short, I know that since we aren't a hive mind, me boycotting these prices wouldn't change the fact that they'll all sell out anyways. Because others choices are separate from mine, and whales will still whale, impulsive buyers will still jump the gun. So at the end of the day, im gonna buy it. 

Tldr: me boycotting it wouldn't change a single thing, so I'll buy it if I want it. 

And let's be real, this is a relatively small IP, and it doesn't involve any civil issues, so a mass boycotting simply will never happen. People will just either buy it and grumble afterwards, or not buy it and grumble about it being out of their price range.
            Nier is by no means a “relatively small IP”. Automata had extreme popularity. So much so that it exists on literally EVERY console now and PC. Once again, you and the whales are the problem. As long as you consume it, they’ll price it as high as they want. Cope with that reality all you want but it doesn’t change the fact that they’re literally aiming at YOU with their price points. Whales account for almost ALL spending. They’re literally just trying to milk you because they know you’re dumb enough to fall for it.
                Yeah no it is a relatively small IP. Big IP is cod, gta, fifa, elder scrolls, red dead, minecraft, fortnite, final fantasy, God of war, halo, horizon, dark souls, bloodborne, elden ring, battlefield, far cry, etc. 

NieR:Automata, and yes specifically Automata, was an out of nowhere smash for what it was. It's launched the IP into the spotlight and into the conversation of jrpgs, Japanese games, and "greatest games ever made" conversations. 

It's critically acclaimed and has a very healthy and steady fanbase, but it's definitely not a big IP. 

And every console is not a claim to fame as a big IP. All kinds of IP nobody gives a shit about are on most platforms.

Me stopping doesn't cause others to stop. And if stopping is meant to cause change, and the situation is unchangeable since others won't all stop with me, then there's 0 point to stopping except for saving my own money, which I don't really care to do atm. 

Popola said it herself >!it's way too late to stop, no one STOOOOOPS!<
                    No, those are MASSIVE iIP’s. Nier is a large IP. Keep coping for spending almost $1000 on garbage wallets.
                        I just considered massive and large to be the same thing for IPs. Point is, they're big. 

NieR isn't a micro indie IP made in some basement. It's made by a respected and accomplished studio, but it's not exactly on the level of common knowledge in the gaming sphere of conversation.

Nobody ever brings it up in random game conversations, nobody really talks about it outside of the reach of the Fandom. 

You'll at best usually get someone commenting on a video "where Automata at on this list?!?!".

It's made waves with its critical acclaim, but it doesn't have jaw dropping sales or massive support.
It's not exactly on game 10 in the franchise, it's on game 2 and it's impossibly lucky that a 2nd one ever even happened. And only the 2nd one has gotten any real attention. 

And yeah I'll continue to cope about the wallets
            You answered your own question, then. If you're gonna buy it, you will. And you can clearly afford it, so problem doesn't even effect you like it does to people like most of us who rarely have $470 to their name, and live paycheck to paycheck.
Oh for sure I know they do it because they can, I'm one heck of a whale for NieR merch. But I'm also sitting her wondering just why now, all of a sudden, for these items specifically, when they aren't exactly all that special or even 1 of a kind for their merch category.

Just for automata alone, supergroupies 2B and 9S wallets, 100$ each, automata card, around 30$ I think, YoRHa phone wallet, idk the actual price because it's cafe exclusive.

Needless to say those are all lower cost items than this, and are of the same type. 

The statue I understand being so dang expensive. It's prime 1. It's a statue. It's a diorama. It's 1/4th. It's polystone. Tack on license fees. And bam I understand the price. 

But these wallets are from no named companies, and not even made from luxury material, and somehow it just jumps to almost 500$?

They could've done this with anything but for some reason these wallets which didn't even need to be made, are somehow more expensive than really rare 1 time release supergroupies wallets? 

It just doesn't make sense.
Gentleman or actually a psychopath 🧐
    Psychotic NieR fan whi dresses nice would be accurate
It's a luxury leather good. very typical to have sticker shock.
    I mean, it's only luxury based on the price. Luxury goods usually have a material and name behind the brand to explain the bullshit pricing. But this isn't even good leather. Nor is it a fashion company item. 

It's just a bullet in the gut. From square, concerning fans.
        Luxury/exclusivity based on price is exactly the point, yup
Also correct
I’m trying to stop wearing so much black now as it is. Haha
    My entire wardrobe is black and white, except for the kaine outfit. 

But yeah black and white is my favorite combo thanks to automata. The asthetic man. The YoRHa drip.


I swear of square made a YoRHa clothing line store, I'd go broke. Just broke.
IMO it doesn't matter to me if it's official or not if it looks good.

$470 is steep for a wallet. I buy men's wallets so I don't have the size problem and I don't pay more than $70 for wallets. Anything over $50 is super expensive.

Edit:

Honestly at that price you may as well buy a figure or other merch.
    I like nice looking stuff of course in general 

But when something is a licensed real part of the franchise, it's more special to me. 

The only unofficial stuff I buy is Tshirts really. Square hasn't exactly flooded the t-shirt market for some reason.
It’s not derpy. It’s a business card wallet, it’s not for credit cards or to replace a wallet. The idea is that it looks smart for working professionals when withdrawing a business card for a potential client or when networking. Business cards are much more important in Japan, as well.
    Ah. I just said it's derpy because it's flimsy, floppy. Not that good in terms of materials. A gift shop item almost. 

I just have no use for it personally. Thank goodness it was cheap (relatively).
Speaking of his fucking bag, I'm still mega butthurt that his leather bag is sold out. 
Like okay, it's a 300$ bag but it's basically a replica and oh my Jesus it would go so nice with the rest of the NieR fit. 

I've got the 2B handbag, the 9S backpack, now I just need a shoulder sling pack and I'd be complete with the bag drip.....but the only automata shoulder sling bag is the 9S one and it's sold out and never appears on the 2nd hand market. 

Sorry for the rant but I really want that damn bag.
    God, same here. $300 was already too much. I don't know how much more of a ridiculous price I'm willing to throw at that damn bag at this point, but it really does NEVER show up.
        I cant tell you in human language how elated I was to actually be able to find the supergroupies 9S watch online. 

That thing is equally as rare as the bag, maybe rarer, and usually you could expect a super rare highly desired supergroupies watch to sell for like 800 on the second hand market.....bro I got it less than retail brand new. 200$ instead of 220 retail. 

I've been getting such good fucking deals recently it's actually stupid.

I got the Bayonetta watch for like 400$ brand new. Which also goes online 800-1k. Never go with eBay. Always go to some Japanese site. So many swindles.
            I was just glad I didn't like the watch much. My 9S based outfit so far is the Supergroupies shoes and the official choker, so I feel like I need the bag to finish the look. 

And totally correct about ebay, there are fair odds that if you find that 9S bag on a JP auction and someone is fighting you for it, it's probably me lol. But I wish us both luck on finding it eventually!
                HEEYYY BUDDDYYYY. Remember this conversation about the 9S shoulder bag?

Heheheh. Well guess whaaaat. I got one BRAND NEW, from ebay......today.......for 680$..... 

It hurt so fucking good. So good. It hurt. So. Good.
                    Daaaaaamnnn!! Congrats!! If you ever come across another, please send a link my way! It was for the best...I bought the 9S PC so I'm still recovering from that this month anyway. Also hurt really good oof
                        Oh yeah I heard those PCs are really pricy for their specs tho. 

I'm actually planning on buying a prebuilt from digital storm for probably 4500-6500$. First PC. Looking to get that 4090 and i9 13900k. But yeah im paying an even bigger premium for them than what square was jabbing people for on their NieR PCS

I'm at least gonna get the PC in NieR colors tho. White cabling and such. 

I'm either going for their velox or their aventum model PC. Both will gut me for money. 

Never used loans or credit before since im young, this PC will probably be my first time I take out a loan for something. 

And yeah if I find a bag I'll shoot a link if I remember. I'll maybe send you some pictures of the bag later, it came in the mail today I think. Maybe a fashion shoot
                Dang bro you don't like the watch?


Yeah my outfit for 9S has everything now for him except that bag. 

I've got his watch, shoes, boots, backpack, choker (was worried I'd look gay with that one, but it's pretty spiffy imo, in fact I wish they'd make a 2B choker now too with her dress pattern on it)

The only 9S stuff I'm missing besides that bag, is his older supergroupies jacket thats blue, and his old supergroupies chain bracelet watch.
                    Haha, yeah, I'm not really a watch person honestly. Plus, I've been trying to make an effort to not dress so masculinely lately, so I figured adding a men's watch to the mix probably wasn't the move for me. Jealous on the old boots because I couldn't track them down in my size!

The choker is such an interesting piece because even as a woman, I feel kinda weird about how it looks when wearing it normally. I like wearing mine in the bracelet style lol.

As for the chain watch, it may not be the correct one since I didn't click it, but I swear I just saw one on Yahoo Auctions or Mercari JP the other day.
Yeah the prime 1 is a no Brainer for its price. This is just immense bullshit pricing. 


The farthest I'd let square enix go and me still buying, is if they made a luxury watch worth a grand or 2. Collectible limited jewelry piece, and would be the highest form of fashionable material/product available for purchase. 

But that's if the quality matches the price or comes close to it. These wallets are the same quality as the card cases that were like 30$. Only difference being size and material. These are to me, 80-100$ at best.
Thing is, it won't last you your lifetime/years. Only good leather will do that. Genuine leather is just mediocre leather. It's the leather that they slap stuff together with to sell to the folk who don't know what kind of leather is good, and just think "oooohh leather, therefore good". 

If its a wallet, or anything actually for clothing and accessories, you want either top grain cow leather, or vegetable leather. 

Both last a lifetime, cow leather is tougher and is better for things like utility clothing and items, vegetable leather is softer, prettier, and better for fashion clothing. 

Genuine leather is just meh.
Thing is that these cycles are unfixable. 

It's not a civil rights thing so there's not gonna be some huge protest that changes things. 

There's no "anti square pricing" groups that are picketing outside the office and boycotting. 

Even if I stop, it won't change anything. So I'll just buy the cool shit as long as I can afford it, if it pleases me at least. 


Wanna know the real funny thing about this? Despite my 10k+ collection, I actively choose to stay away from reincarnation knowing that it's a pointless gacha pit. 
Oh and I stayed away from anything vinyl that they released because I know that's an expensive hobby. 
That and vinyl has Lower sound quality than CD/Bluetooth so there's not much of a point. Also inconvenient to store. 

So yeah, selective spender lol. Just unfortunately/fortunately, there's a lot of cool shit I'll sucker up for. Like these wallets. They're pretty neat. Chaching
I'm surprised to see a comment on an old post of mine. 

Glad you like the collection.
I haven't really shown much of it. My first post is of the prime 1 statue in case you're interested in how the one I got looks. 

Haven't really showed the rest of my collection, but I've got all the supergroupies stuff except the old pod backpacks and the brother nier jacket (still hunting for that thing)
I've got 11 cds, 1 blu ray, some jewelry, some misc official clothes like the 9s leather bag and choker, hoodies and shirts, and I have some fan made hoodies and shirts. 
The collectors editions of both games, a lot of books, aaaand the flare and play arts 2B. 
That's the basic summary of my stuff. 

If you want the best NieR merch, i recommend going hunting for the supergroupies clothing on ebay and buyee.jp, the jewelry square releases, and the soundtracks.

If you're insane like me with NieR + have bad spending habits like me or you have lots of money, then you can't do better than the prime 1 studios statue, and these wallets here are also high high end for nier merch.

Although take it from me, I'm no expert on leather, but these wallets are definitely scams. I know I bought them anyways, but I'm just....like that. I kinda wanted casual NieR wallets for everyday use (even tho I already got the supergroupies wallets)

But here's why these wallets are scams. They're only genuine leather. That's the basic entry level actual leather. So it's not even nice leather. 
I own actual nice leather, specifically a jacket, and it's from supergroupies.
It's the dark souls leather jacket. 480$. So it's way higher quality leather (vegetable tanned leather), with way more leather used (jacket size vs wallet size amount of leather)
And the jacket is also a fashion jacket with motifs of dark souls, and yet the wallet still costs the same amount.


It's a scam, buts it's the kind that a sucker like me will bite on, and if you're like me and got the money AND the addiction to NieR and bad spending habits to match, You'll probably Bite too.
Which one are you looking to buy? I'm more of a fan of automata than replicant so I bought automatas, but I have the kaine supergroupies clothes which are all blue, and kaine never got a wallet from supergroupies, so I just had to bite the bullet and buy the replicant one too in order to have a matching fit.

As for overall advice on the wallets, nobody has them yet so no advice can be actually given. 
They're really cool, but for the same price you could cop yourself a supergroupies 2B wallet for around 100-200, nab some shoes in your size if you're lucky for around 100-200, or get a jacket or one of the characters watches. 

Just weigh the cost of it against other things NieR that you could get for the same price. 
Keep in mind that supergroupies stuff is more collectible too because they're 1 time releases. 

My last piece of advice for expensive merch shopping, use Japan rabbit to shop on the Japanese square enix site. You'll save so much money. 

Here's a good example. Supergroupies released the bloodborne watch years ago for 300$, people on ebay ask a minimum of 700-800$ for it now. They recently released it in Japan, and using Japan rabbit, it knocked the price down to 230$ from 300$ retail because yen is worth less than $, and after shipping it was only 260$.

Same applies for these wallets. I probably saved over 100$ on these wallets by using Japan rabbit. 

And the best website for aftermarket shopping like ebay, is buyee.jp. They're a center for all kinds of websites that resell stuff. Super useful for quick merch hunting. And it's cheaper than ebay. The Japanese charge less. Same wallet by same seller on buyee vs ebay, buyee has it as 200$, eBay has it for 700$.
Well I googled what the word means it just seems to mean a shut-in who constantly plays video games and watches TV or goes on their phone. Describes me perfectly, but I don't see any description for being a mega fan or having bleedable income.
    nah, they got it wrong. hikikomori is just a shut in. many are weebs, but not every hiki is a weeb/nerd
No white rabbit is just scamming themselves currently. 

Their prices used to hike up what you're paying a lot. 

Now I almost always pay cheaper than retail from Japan. And that's after shipping. 

White rabbit just hasn't adjusted for inflation I guess?
You can’t complain when you’re literally the problem bro. They do it because they know you’ll buy it because you have more money than brains when it comes to merch. You’ll see merch, you’ll spend the money, and you’ll keep doing it. It’s the same reason “collectors editions” suck nowadays, including the Nier ones. White Snow for Replicant Remake was alright at best. You can’t make a post like this complaining about the price then be like, “I bought both anyways”. Like bro have some self awareness.
    I am aware of the relationship I create by buying exactly what im complaining about. 

Your reply implies I buy just any merch of NieR, I don't. I have my picks and I have my passes. 

I bought the wallets simply because it looks nice, has been something I've actually been looking forward to for a while, and I had the money to buy said items. But I never expected it to be this ridiculously priced. 

My desire for it outweighs my disgust for the price. Doesn't mean I can't complain about the price despite buying it. 

470$ is objectively ridiculous for anything less than a top quality material wallet. 

The fans don't set the prices first, the business does. And whether or not YOU buy into it, doesn't change that someone else will since there's so many consumers out there, and they are all different people of differing opinions. 


Wanna know what real awareness looks like? Alright. I'm game. 
I'm aware of the fact that the "if I don't, then someone else will" mentality is exactly what causes people to impulsively do things, including buying merch of ridiculous pricing. 
So deciding to buy it because I think not buying it wouldn't change anything, is what then perpetuates the cycle. 

So not buying it is supposed to be the logical choice to end the cycle. Yet I'm also aware that humans despite almost all having this same thought process about "changing themselves", never usually go through with this change, and that not all people will go through with the change just because someone else does. 

In short, I know that since we aren't a hive mind, me boycotting these prices wouldn't change the fact that they'll all sell out anyways. Because others choices are separate from mine, and whales will still whale, impulsive buyers will still jump the gun. So at the end of the day, im gonna buy it. 

Tldr: me boycotting it wouldn't change a single thing, so I'll buy it if I want it. 

And let's be real, this is a relatively small IP, and it doesn't involve any civil issues, so a mass boycotting simply will never happen. People will just either buy it and grumble afterwards, or not buy it and grumble about it being out of their price range.
        Nier is by no means a “relatively small IP”. Automata had extreme popularity. So much so that it exists on literally EVERY console now and PC. Once again, you and the whales are the problem. As long as you consume it, they’ll price it as high as they want. Cope with that reality all you want but it doesn’t change the fact that they’re literally aiming at YOU with their price points. Whales account for almost ALL spending. They’re literally just trying to milk you because they know you’re dumb enough to fall for it.
            Yeah no it is a relatively small IP. Big IP is cod, gta, fifa, elder scrolls, red dead, minecraft, fortnite, final fantasy, God of war, halo, horizon, dark souls, bloodborne, elden ring, battlefield, far cry, etc. 

NieR:Automata, and yes specifically Automata, was an out of nowhere smash for what it was. It's launched the IP into the spotlight and into the conversation of jrpgs, Japanese games, and "greatest games ever made" conversations. 

It's critically acclaimed and has a very healthy and steady fanbase, but it's definitely not a big IP. 

And every console is not a claim to fame as a big IP. All kinds of IP nobody gives a shit about are on most platforms. 


Yeah I am part of the problem by being a whale for the franchise, but have you not realized that there is actually no such thing as a franchise where whales collectively stop whaling? Me stopping doesn't cause others to stop. And if stopping is meant to cause change, and the situation is unchangeable since others won't all stop with me, then there's 0 point to stopping except for saving my own money, which I don't really care to do atm. 

Popola said it herself >!it's way too late to stop, no one STOOOOOPS!<
                No, those are MASSIVE iIP’s. Nier is a large IP. Keep coping for spending almost $1000 on garbage wallets.
                    I just considered massive and large to be the same thing for IPs. Point is, they're big. 

NieR isn't a micro indie IP made in some basement. It's made by a respected and accomplished studio, but it's not exactly on the level of common knowledge in the gaming sphere of conversation.

Nobody ever brings it up in random game conversations, nobody really talks about it outside of the reach of the Fandom. 

You'll at best usually get someone commenting on a video "where Automata at on this list?!?!".

It's made waves with its critical acclaim, but it doesn't have jaw dropping sales or massive support.
It's not exactly on game 10 in the franchise, it's on game 2 and it's impossibly lucky that a 2nd one ever even happened. And only the 2nd one has gotten any real attention. 

And yeah I'll continue to cope about the wallets
        You answered your own question, then. If you're gonna buy it, you will. And you can clearly afford it, so problem doesn't even effect you like it does to people like most of us who rarely have $470 to their name, and live paycheck to paycheck.
Psychotic NieR fan whi dresses nice would be accurate
I mean, it's only luxury based on the price. Luxury goods usually have a material and name behind the brand to explain the bullshit pricing. But this isn't even good leather. Nor is it a fashion company item.

                    Oh yeah I heard those PCs are really pricy for their specs tho. 

I'm actually planning on buying a prebuilt from digital storm for probably 4500-6500$. First PC. Looking to get that 4090 and i9 13900k. But yeah im paying an even bigger premium for them than what square was jabbing people for on their NieR PCS

I'm at least gonna get the PC in NieR colors tho. White cabling and such. 

I'm either going for their velox or their aventum model PC. Both will gut me for money. 

Never used loans or credit before since im young, this PC will probably be my first time I take out a loan for something. 

And yeah if I find a bag I'll shoot a link if I remember. I'll maybe send you some pictures of the bag later, it came in the mail today I think. Maybe a fashion shoot

            Haha, yeah, I'm not really a watch person honestly. Plus, I've been trying to make an effort to not dress so masculinely lately, so I figured adding a men's watch to the mix probably wasn't the move for me. Jealous on the old boots because I couldn't track them down in my size!

The choker is such an interesting piece because even as a woman, I feel kinda weird about how it looks when wearing it normally. I like wearing mine in the bracelet style lol.

As for the chain watch, it may not be the correct one since I didn't click it, but I swear I just saw one on Yahoo Auctions or Mercari JP the other day.
Nier is by no means a “relatively small IP”. Automata had extreme popularity. So much so that it exists on literally EVERY console now and PC. Once again, you and the whales are the problem. As long as you consume it, they’ll price it as high as they want. Cope with that reality all you want but it doesn’t change the fact that they’re literally aiming at YOU with their price points. Whales account for almost ALL spending. They’re literally just trying to milk you because they know you’re dumb enough to fall for it.
    Yeah no it is a relatively small IP. Big IP is cod, gta, fifa, elder scrolls, red dead, minecraft, fortnite, final fantasy, God of war, halo, horizon, dark souls, bloodborne, elden ring, battlefield, far cry, etc. 

NieR:Automata, and yes specifically Automata, was an out of nowhere smash for what it was. It's launched the IP into the spotlight and into the conversation of jrpgs, Japanese games, and "greatest games ever made" conversations. 

It's critically acclaimed and has a very healthy and steady fanbase, but it's definitely not a big IP. 

And every console is not a claim to fame as a big IP. All kinds of IP nobody gives a shit about are on most platforms. 


Yeah I am part of the problem by being a whale for the franchise, but have you not realized that there is actually no such thing as a franchise where whales collectively stop whaling? Me stopping doesn't cause others to stop. And if stopping is meant to cause change, and the situation is unchangeable since others won't all stop with me, then there's 0 point to stopping except for saving my own money, which I don't really care to do atm. 

Popola said it herself >!it's way too late to stop, no one STOOOOOPS!<
        No, those are MASSIVE iIP’s. Nier is a large IP. Keep coping for spending almost $1000 on garbage wallets.
            I just considered massive and large to be the same thing for IPs. Point is, they're big. 

NieR isn't a micro indie IP made in some basement. It's made by a respected and accomplished studio, but it's not exactly on the level of common knowledge in the gaming sphere of conversation.

Nobody ever brings it up in random game conversations, nobody really talks about it outside of the reach of the Fandom. 

You'll at best usually get someone commenting on a video "where Automata at on this list?!?!".

It's made waves with its critical acclaim, but it doesn't have jaw dropping sales or massive support.
It's not exactly on game 10 in the franchise, it's on game 2 and it's impossibly lucky that a 2nd one ever even happened. And only the 2nd one has gotten any real attention. 

And yeah I'll continue to cope about the wallets
You answered your own question, then. If you're gonna buy it, you will. And you can clearly afford it, so problem doesn't even effect you like it does to people like most of us who rarely have $470 to their name, and live paycheck to paycheck.
I was just glad I didn't like the watch much. My 9S based outfit so far is the Supergroupies shoes and the official choker, so I feel like I need the bag to finish the look. 

And totally correct about ebay, there are fair odds that if you find that 9S bag on a JP auction and someone is fighting you for it, it's probably me lol. But I wish us both luck on finding it eventually!
    HEEYYY BUDDDYYYY. Remember this conversation about the 9S shoulder bag?

Heheheh. Well guess whaaaat. I got one BRAND NEW, from ebay......today.......for 680$..... 

It hurt so fucking good. So good. It hurt. So. Good.
        Daaaaaamnnn!! Congrats!! If you ever come across another, please send a link my way! It was for the best...I bought the 9S PC so I'm still recovering from that this month anyway. Also hurt really good oof
            Oh yeah I heard those PCs are really pricy for their specs tho. 

I'm actually planning on buying a prebuilt from digital storm for probably 4500-6500$. First PC. Looking to get that 4090 and i9 13900k. But yeah im paying an even bigger premium for them than what square was jabbing people for on their NieR PCS

I'm at least gonna get the PC in NieR colors tho. White cabling and such. 

I'm either going for their velox or their aventum model PC. Both will gut me for money. 

Never used loans or credit before since im young, this PC will probably be my first time I take out a loan for something. 

And yeah if I find a bag I'll shoot a link if I remember. I'll maybe send you some pictures of the bag later, it came in the mail today I think. Maybe a fashion shoot
    Dang bro you don't like the watch?


Yeah my outfit for 9S has everything now for him except that bag.
