[[When weight of the world kicks in]]





I tend to avoid the song, because I hate to cry in public :D It just hits too hard
    I feel you.
The English version of Weight of the World made me cry... Then I read a translation of the Japanese version... Better replace that tank with an ICBM.

Only go there when you're in the mood for a good cry and have a package of anti-depressants on hand.
    End of YORHA version does it for me. When all the developers join in I completely melt.
        Yeah man that part is wild. It’s already emotional because it transcends language, but then the developers start singing and I swear to god it’s impossible to hold it together. 

*Especially* while you’re shooting the credits and receiving help from other players who erased their save data just to help you make it to the end.
    Already did it, while LISTENING to the song, I cried together with Kawano
    It's so damn good the singer cried during the song
    Shit, I just clicked the link without scrolling further to see what u wrote below, and now my mood, suddenly obliterated, is crying “Help! I’ve fallen and I can’t get up!”
    Ive listened to weight of the world jp version b4 and try not to read the lyrics cause this might happen and it did... it ducking did... it hit hard
    The climactic part of >!the Ending E version with the staff singing along as their swan song of solidarity in their last stand against the players!<...
BUT IM ONLY ONE GIIIIIIIIRRRLLLLL
    Maybe if I keep believing my dreams will come to liiife, coome to liife.....
Tell me god, are, you punishing me?

        This..is..my reeeedemption song
            I need you more than ever right nooow....
                Can you hear me nowww
Same with Ashes of Dreams
When the chorus at the end kicked in, literally started streaming tears down my cheeks. It was just such a powerful moment that actually led me to sacrifice my save data.
Final part of The End Of Yorha 
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na naaaaaaaaa
    Make me cry every time:((
Ashes of Dreams was incredible too, but Weight of the World just hits different, especially the Japanese version.

DoD3 also had some plain evil choices of songs, but especially Better End, and only after having completed the game I realized it's evil-ness
    DoD3 is underrated, man
Nier: Crytamata
It's weird, but this song have the opposite effect on me...but in the other hand: 

- Emil Sacrifice (the OG, not the remix from 1.22)
- Kainé Salvation (the OG)
- Grandma (the OG)
- Shadowlord (the OG)
- Snow in Summer (the OG)
- Ashes of Dreams (the OG)
- Voice of no Return (that damn sidequest!)
- Vague Hope (spring rain)

Those tracks really hit me!!
    Keichii knows how to do real bangers, that's the truth.
So the bomber in the next scene is me remembering that I'm dead inside?
    Exactly
In the JP version, the singer legit starts crying.
    Yeah, I know. Listen to it while reading to the translation of it and you'll also cry with her.
Yeah I have it on my playlist but I avoid it unless it’s a special occasion where I’m really feeling like getting extra emotional lol
*STILL WE’RE GONNA SHOUT IT LOUUUUUUD* haven’t even played automata yet and it hits hard.
    The sooner you play, the less regrets you will have one day. Except not being able to experience it anew
        Yeah I’ve heard many similar things, which is why I’m really looking forward to it haha
            If you do, allow me to give you this gift in advance (it's obsolete in the part when it talks about mods \[avoid installing them, just in case\])

The only spoilers it contains are about the quest names, several game design features (such as how the game is partitioned), and stuff like that. So try to check it only when you really need some questions answered.
For me it's vague hope
Teared up at the End of YoRHa version about 15 minutes before seeing this post. Way too relatable 😅
Ashes of dreams hits me harder
    Both are awesome. City Ruins gives me chills everytime as well, tbh.
This is what The Tower does to me
    Ashes of dreams, song of the ancients, ALL of them
        Yes
This song's been in my head for the past few weeks since I finished Automata
Fortress of lies flies in and bombs it.
I was driving a fair distance with a mate to a wedding earlier this year, and my mate put this on my car radio thinking I would like it.

I started crying.
Me: \*no efforts to prevent crying were made\*

I just finished Long Story Short, with the >!End of Yorha!< playing in the background, and the whole ending was very emotive.

I hope everything in the story gets me this easily every time I play/read forever. I don't ever want to be inmune to the feelings
    I am not talking only about listening to it on the ending of the game, I am talking about listening to it as a music on daily life, with the emotions and flashbacks about the game coming back too.
        Well, in that case it doesn't work for me. In fact, I'm concerned about that if I listen often to the songs that play in especially sad moments, the magic when they play in those moments will be gone
            Fine bro 👍
Check out my brother's cover of the song here :). I got to listen to this for weeks while he was practicing!

There was one time where the eng ver and japanese ver were on the same spotify playlist of mine, it was on shuffle and then both version were played back to back :) definitely not a wise decision 🤧
I think Ashes of Dreams hits harder, especially after how the game ends
    Both, both are awesome
        I don't think anyone is debating that haha
            Don't you dare to ask me which is better
                Which is better
                    Or, as the pods would say: Unknown
                        Love it, haha
                    No reply. Hahahaha
Plot twist, its the FFXIV version.
    ANY VERSION
For when you like the song but want to feel inspired instead of sad: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v72zoaQVTg0
