[[Nier Automata reaches 7.5 millions copies soldshipped; devs thank everyone for their support]]





Glad I contributed a bit to that number
    I contributed twice
        I contributed thrice 🥰
            I contributed nice
            I bought like 9 copies fuck ALL of you fake fans
                Nice to know some people are still gatekeepers over what "truly" makes you a real fan. You don't need to own 9 copies or more to be a true fan. Buying the same game for all of my devices is enough for me to say I love the game. But you do you lol.
                    Redditors needing tone indicators for things like this is the most hilarious thing ever
                        Well I do enjoy making people laugh. In all fairness, it's hard to tell what is or isn't sarcasm over the internet for some people. A lot of people on the spectrum also don't understand sarcasm, so yeah. There's also that lol. Have a wonderful day 🥰❤️
                            It's ok. It is reddit after all and you don't know what kind of character is saying things lol
                    Smartest redditor
                        okay??? idk why i'm getting downvotes tho lmao
Still amazed how it didn’t win game of the year.
    Sadly, because Nier/DoD series are a ultra niche games, same as Gravity Rush Series (PS4), Puppeteer (PS3), Deadly Premonition (PS3)...I would have wanted many more people to know these beautiful works.
        Not that niche if it sold 7.5 million copies
            Nier is an anomaly because it's a sleeper hit. The general rule is that a game will make most of its sales in the first few weeks, but in the case of Nier Automata it was "just" 1.5 million copies in the first 2 months. The idea that the game would stay in the public consciousness so consistently to sell another 6 millions is truly surprising.
                Having better, more lively gameplay thanks to PlatinumGames' work is a very decisive factor in the overall success of the game. Otherwise, N:A would only be remembered in the same level as the original Nier, or Drakengard 3.
                reddit API access ended today, and with it the reddit app i use Apollo, i am removing all my comments, the internet is both temporary and eternal.  -- mass edited with redact.dev
            7.5m in a span of 6 years...every damn FIFA, CoD sells million in a couple of months, this the sad true.
                It's one title though that's really damn good.   Those games are franchises
                    nier isn't a franchise?
                Those, imho, meaningless games beat this meaningful game.


Edit: actually i never play CoD, if there is any of it's title is good, lmk, thanks!
                    There’s a few good titles that came out over 10 years like World at War, Black ops 1 & 2, cod 4 and mw2 (2009) but they’re nothing crazy. Just some dumb fun with an enjoyable campaign
                        Infinite Warfare is also really good
                        Ah right.. i always want to play World War one but in the end never play lol no story in CoD i guess?
                            Nothing close to something like nier haha but those 5 story’s are fine
                Yeah, but it's the difference between between fine dining and mcdonalds. Not the best metaphor.
                FIFA and CoD don't win GOTY either
            It started out niche. Word of mouth has had it defying all conventionally known standards for videogames. Most game sales happen in the first two weeks. NieR Automata has been steadily selling ~1 million per year. It defies all logic.
                It's people discovering the ass pics and going down the rabbit hole.
                    The design of the next main character is going be the hardest thing for the developers lmao. 2B’s design was so good it made a multitude of people buy the game on that alone.
                        Hire Loomy for character designer
            I played it on Xbox Game Pass so I never actually bought it. I wonder how they take those numbers into account
                They said sold and shipped, so it’d have to ignore game pass downloads. If it was presented as “the amount of players who have played the game” then game pass numbers would be included.
        Automata isnt ultra niche, i mean its accessible and enjoyable to many JRPG players, even for more classic RPG players, i wasnt into JRPGs before playing with nier, not because i didnt liked them, just because i didnt really know them, Nier was the bridge that connected me to this genre of games. 

And i do belive its less niche than Elden Ring ^^
        Gravity rush is one of the most unique games I’ve ever played and I hope they make a third installment like they said they would potentially would see you as the PS five is a thing now
            The Gravity Rush studio is dead. Sony killed them off.

Some of them work for Team Asobi but it's only a 40 people strong team, a good number of the Devs got absorbed by Nintendo/Monolith Soft.
The environment designer of Bloodborne is now working on games like Xenoblade and Zelda TOTK to give an example.

The rest is working on a multiplat horror game as an independent studio.
        I thought I was the only person who knew Gravity Rush existed, god both games were so good :(
    There’s nothing to be amazed by really, Automata released in the same year as Breath of the Wild, which sold almost 4 times as many copies as it.
        One teaches you about individualism and self identity the other is just entertainment. One of my first game I played was Majora Mask at 8 years old which changed my life I’m not bashing the game. But one is more powerful and you can called it more than a video game. I think the idea of it “selling more” doesn’t fit in the argument or it’s irrelevant in this case.
            The “argument of selling more” is used in this case because Nier’s popularity is a joke compared to Zelda’s, I’m not saying which one is better, I like Automata more actually, but Nier wouldn’t ever win GotY in the same year a Zelda game releases, simple as that.

GotY doesn’t depend on what me or you like more, it depends on having a humongous amount of praise and success. God of War was a more popular franchise than Red Dead Redemption in 2018, that’s why it won over RDR2. Both had similar amounts of praise, but GoW won because it’s more popular.
                But if you’re saying sells than yea obviously Zelda wins because of its history and nostalgia it has on players. As well it appeals to a universal crowd even parents who have no idea about gaming bought it for there young one. I highly doubt parents will buy Nier for their kids.

Again you’re right it’s a popularity contest but let’s be real with each other one is more powerful than the other.
                    Absolutely
    Just look at the games that came out in 2017 it was one of the most stacked years for gaming
    GOTY is a joke anyway
    What got game of the year on that year?
        Breath of the wild. It was a really, really stacked year
            On the plus side, being able to beat a Zelda game in the music category is an accomplishment in and of itself.
                Tbh, even thoough I really like BOTW ost it was far from the strongest of the licence.
    It won for music though and it definitely deserved that.
    I was hoping for DOS 2 to win, but yeah, NA deserved the win as well.

I liked BOTW but it just doesn't compare to DOS and NA.
    Because of the BOTW. I enjoy playing nier but tbh it's not good as BOTW.
        To each it’s own but Nier explore philosophy and took it to another level.
            I must say that I do not quite agree with the idea that it took philosophy to an another level. It can seem very deep and attractive to an outsider because it looks at the existential concepts that have been processed almost since the emergence of philosophy from a different perspective and blends them with their own lore.  This is quite enough for the gaming industry and may even set a new bar.  However, when taken alone, it did not bring a new mind-blowing solution to the old problems nor extended them. Just enough to keep you playing and finishing it 4/5 times.
                The point is that N:A utilized its own video game medium to drive home such preexisting philosophical subject matter to a more modern audience (and the degree of accessibility it comes), taking to account the contemporary systemic and societal factors associated with such audiences.
                To each it’s own but explore blood borne or any souls game.
                I would agree, but as someone who was familiar with the concepts explored in NieR Automata, playing it made me "get it". I think there is an emotional dimension to every philosophical concept, that goes beyond superficial knowledge, something where you intrinsically understand where an argument is coming from and where it wants to go. NieR in general does that pretty well
        It's all subjective, I put nier in top 5 games I've ever played, and BOTW is something like 6.5/10 for me.
            Yeah, for me it’s easily top 3, and number 1 depending on how recently I’ve thought about it/played it/watched a video about it. BotW is great and all as a Nintendo (game) fan, but one extensive playthrough of the game was enough for me. It doesn’t have good enough story, mechanics, or combat for me to keep coming back to it like I do with Nier.
        Botw is only impressive for what it did for open worlds on the hardware it was on.

Botw doesn't even get a stake in the same league as automata for things like story, narrative, characters, music, gameplay diversity, genre diversity, art direction, character design, VA work, animations, combat, lore, quest design, or overall writing.

Strip the word "zelda" from BOTW and it wouldn't sell half as well as it did. It rode the Fandoms nostalgia hard-on to success. It's the same principle as call of duty, where the name of the franchise self perpetuates the sales and success of the franchise, despite whether or not the latest installment is good. 

And it wasn't just BOTW affecting automata sales. Automata had to fight tooth and nail against what would be a playstation exclusive hit release called horizon zero dawn. One of the highest critically acclaimed indie games ever called hollow knight, and it had to fight against the fact that NieR was by then a no name franchise nobody had heard of before except the extremely niche gestalt and drakengard Fandom, so Automata had to fight for its success all on its own without the support of the series earlier installments to act as a backbone.

Zelda had a massive Fandom and series to act as its support, horizon was a playstation exclusive pushing  graphics at the time, so of course it was gonna sell well. Hollow knight came out at the start of the year and was building momentum and popularity the whole year. 

Automatas release date was almost a death sentence on paper, but it made its own hit success and the franchise is now alive again because of it.
            Wow preach! Would it support your argument that that in my 25 years of gaming this is the only game to ever make me cry. Well actually cry 4 times. Till this day I listen to the soundtrack! It’s my favorite album of all time! It beat my old favorite album In rainbows by Radiohead.
            You gave very good reasons, but after finishing nier, I never felt the need to go back and play it again. The same is not true for zelda.  I can't help but go back and play it almost every year. I guess we look for different things in our games and that's okay.
            BOTW did not relied on nostalgia, a lot of locations of other Zelda games are reduced to ruins that you can casually find and aren't relevant to the game, some characters return while the majority are only mentioned vaguely, the game itself is practically different from any other Zelda games and a lot of things didn't return.

The game success is thanks to the freedom you have to do ANYTHING and the huge amount of ways you can interact with the beautiful world around you. I love Nier as much as the next person, being my favorite game and franchise but there's no need to shit on another masterpiece.
                Not shitting on it, putting it in its place in respect to the better game. 

Sure the gameplay was nice, but would you mind speaking loudly and clearly into the microphone when you admit this. 

What was the main reason BOTW sold well?

Say it with me now. It's because it had the word Z-E-L-D-A in the title. 

Zelda is the synonym for many people's childhood. Aka nostalgia. 

Fandom that started as children + new installment to a beloved classic franchise that hasn't gotten a game in forever + is the spearhead showcase game for a new NINTENDO platform = $$$$$ success, overt blind praise. 

You can do a lot in zelda BOTW, but it's still *just* zelda. There's no remarkable story to be had, no extremely well written characters to be experienced, no innovation in genre diversity, passable animations, an OST that's good by normal standards, but outclassed by NieR standards. 


It's a lot like skyrim. Huge expanse of unexplored possibilities at the time it came out, rejuvenating life in the genre and becoming a genre defining game. 

But fast forward past its recency bias and prime days, and then people realize the story and characters are shallow, the music is nostalgic but now outclassed by better compositions in the industry, the combat becomes dated, and all around there's much left to be desired. 

Hense  1 reason why skyrims modding community is the biggest around. 
Great for a first time experience, remove those glory goggles though and you just have a lot left to wish for. 


It's a good rpg game, but you can't just be "a good rpg game" for a conversation where the competition is a game like automata. You gotta have more substance than just a good gameplay experience. You need deeper stuff. 

Unless you're just really against dark stories/sad stuff, then even NieR replicant, a game that's a parody of zelda is already better than zelda since it does exactly what im saying zelda games are missing. Only downside is the gameplay is worse than BOTW. But it's beating BOTW in basically every other category. 

So if a dark zelda parody is better than zelda itself, then I can't take someone seriously or respect their opinion when they say BOTW is better than Automata, a game that's better than the game that's parodying zelda, that's already better than zelda. 

Once again I'm not shitting on BOTW, it's great for what it is,  but an opinion of it being better than Automata is so misplaced and jarring that it can't be ignored. Not by me.
                    >Say it with me now. It's because it had the word Z-E-L-D-A in the title

No, that's not true, at all. It's a factor? Yes, but i can use this same argument with every successful franchise in history and it will quickly prove itself to be wrong because it doesn't matter how famous you are if your game is shit, is shit. It's not the same thing. BOTW would not have been THIS successful if it wasn't a pretty damn good game, period.

>But fast forward past its recency bias and prime days, and then people realize the story and characters are shallow, the music is nostalgic but now outclassed by better compositions in the industry, the combat becomes dated, and all around there's much left to be desired. 

The characters aren't shallow, Link alone loses a lot of nuance because the translation to english fucked things up, like having the quest journal being writing in his perspective with his comments instead of a generic list of objectives. The combat is not dated because just like Nier, you don't just hit and dodge so this point doesn't make sense. I'm not sayings BOTW is perfect anyway, it isn't.

>Once again I'm not shitting on BOTW, it's great for what it is, but an opinion of it being better than Automata is so misplaced and jarring that it can't be ignored. Not by me.

You're not imparting justice by defending it, Yoko Taro isn't going to come and congratulate you. There's no "better game", BOTW and Automata can't even begin to be compared because their goals and effects are so vastly different that this entire conversation is pointless because it's reduced to personal preference, that's why i am discussing it with you, because you made no sense trying to "Putting it in it's place in respect to the better game"

>You can do a lot in zelda BOTW, but it's still just zelda. There's no remarkable story to be had, no extremely well written characters to be experienced, no innovation in genre diversity, passable animations, an OST that's good by normal standards, but outclassed by NieR standards. 

And? The gameplay is extremely fun, the story is alright, the game innovated upon every other Zelda game and in how to build a open world that actually let's you do things instead of marking everything the devs want you to see, the music is good that does it's job, it doesn't need to "outclass" anything.

"BOTW is good but NieR is better" is basically what I'm against, not only is personal preference it also doesn't matter, if it's good it's good, it doesn't need to be better than every game in existence. Like it or not, BOTW is a masterpiece of open world game, freedom and gameplay, this doesn't negate NieR being a masterpiece of storytelling, music and gameplay integration on the story itself.
                    >TW, it's great for what it is,  but an opinion of it being better than Automata is so misplaced and jarring that it can't be ignored. Not by me.

Zelda was never a great selling franchise. BotW definitely didn't sell that well because of the name. For comparison Skyward Sword sold less than 4M on the Wii.
                        Very late reply on my part. But I'm not saying that zelda sold as insanely well as call of duty or gta, etc. I'm saying it's name carries more weight and has a broader fanbase and nostalgia to pull from. 

Nier series was essentially unknown until automata. It was the definition of cult classic or cult series. Very obscure. 

Zelda has always been one of the most iconic well known Nintendo series. Not Mario or sonic levels. But it firmly established itself in gaming culture as an iconic series. 

Hype around botw was insane. 
Automata didn't have such hype because it had no name to back it up to make people excited, since old NieR sold like shite and didn't become a cultural hit in gaming. 

It did have a lot of interest though. Just not hype. 

Nostalgia didn't sell botw alone, but it really contributed a lot to it. It already had a big fanbase of people who grew up playing zelda games that were hyped for it. 

My argument is simply that nostalgia helped sell a lot of botw copies, and that same nostalgia also creates a clouded judgement bias on people's opinions of the actual game.
This game and persona 5 are the only games to date that I ever bought on three separate platforms and the only games I feel were actually worth triple dipping on
    Persona 5 is a visual novel not a game
        It’s got at least 50 hours of turn based jrpg gameplay, it’s definitely a game even if you don’t think vns count
            Not to mention the dungeon crawling
        Oh hell no, at least half the game is action based dungeon crawling.
        By this logic Final Fantasy games are visual novels.
        You must be thinking of P3P
    Same here plus Xenoblade 1. I got the Wii Version, the 3DS version and the Definitive Edition for the Switch lol.
    Completely agree with this 100percent.
Welcome, now announce that sequel already, ffs.
    SE: Sequel??? How about 1million more crossovers?
    I understand the desire, but at the same time I have my doubts another NieR would be as good. I mean, they could just make a sequel to continue the story, but another title wouldn't be able to repeat the same storytelling devices that Automata did without feeling like a rehash. Well, I suppose the same could be said about Replicant, but I feel like Replicant/Gestalt was obscure enough that Automata got away with it.
        In Yoko Taro's style, it will probably never be a DIRECT sequel, but a story in the future of the same universe, where probably 2B and 9S are legends and like Adam and Eve for the future generations. I'm fine with that, as long as the spirit and feel of the Nier franchise is kept.
        Of course it’ll be good if taro makes it
    Isn't Reincarnation the sequel? Idk, I haven't played Reincarnation yet.
        It's a mobile game
            True, but it's also canon.
Though I should say that I'd also love a new game on console and PC. Mobile games aren't my cup of tea either.
            if you like it or not, its the sequel
        More of a spinoff than a sequel
        No one knows how it fits into the universe. Not a direct sequel at the very least.
Now lets see how many ate the mackerel and >!sacrificed their save file!<
    Played this on PS4 and then again on Switch and sacrificed my save file both times. The help I got during those credits was desperately needed. Not sure about the mackerel tho. Will have to try that one.
    Dude, spoilers
        I don't really think so but I guess I'll mark it as such
            I sacrificed mine. I hope someone here benefits from it.
            That’s like… the biggest spoiler. I mean, it’s completely out of context but as soon as someone gets to the right place they’ll know what you meant and it would ruin it.
                I might have missed something because I can't see how knowing that ruins anything. I actually don't remember exactly when it happens. I guess I need to play the game again :)
                    I just feel like knowing it’s coming, when you get to the end and >!you get other people to help you!< it would be pretty obvious what’s going to happen and rob it of a lot of the emotional impact.
One of the best games I ever played for sure, as it was able to touch my heart which is very hard for a game to do. 

Definitely was worth the money, and I am very happy to be part of the 7.5 million. I got it on my Xbox in 2019, but I wish they had physical copies for us since I collect and game by physical copy.
    Played it for the first time on the Xbox too, and I really wish I had a physical copy on the shelf

I printed out a little picture of the cover and put it inside the box for Replicant to make up for that though
This is the only game that I've ever played from which I can say that they rightfully deserved my money.
    I regret bought this game only for $20 during sale. I redeemed my guilts by buying Replicant v.12247's cheaper collector edition (because the other one was not released in my country), even though i don't really like that CE, but ok, i hope i contribute a bit to Yoko Taro future development.
    So not the pc version.
        The PC version works really well on Linux, I think the issue is Windows
            Game's been fixed to not have FAR as a requirement __FOUR YEARS LATER AFTER IT'S RELEASE__
                I recently finished this game on PC. So... Yeah... Hehe
            Nice to know, I'll have to pick it up!
Surely at this point they've got justification to make a sequel or prequel?
    There's already a prequel
        No, there isn't. A prequel, by definition, is something that released later than the thing it's a prequel to. Drakengard 3 is a prequel to Drakengard 1 for example. NieR: Automata however is a sequel to Gestalt/Replicant.
            Yeah that's not the case lol replicant is a prequel to automata
                Nier replicant came out first then automata, replicant isn’t a prequel it is the previous game in the series
                Please explain your rationale
                Bruh...
                so confident, but so wrong
            A pre-make?
        I wouldn't consider Replicant to be a prequel to automata. World building? yes. Replicant is a story in it's own right (and a damn good one too).

A prequel would be something like the formation of Yorha, a sequel would be what happens after the true ending of automata.

Before all the lore masters chime in with "we already know, it's in obscure comic/short story/radio play/program to a music concert" I'm aware, but I would like to see it all collected in game form.
            Replicant was also just the previous game. It came out before Automata.
            There isn't enough lore imo to make a whole game out of the formation of yorha. If i remember right yorha was only 5 or so years old when automata starts. A game detailing one of emils adventures during the few thousands years between replicant and nier would be awesome, or a game set right after the queen beast falls upon tokyo and the red eye legion starts to appear would be cool too.
Played nier for the first time this year. Instantly became one of my favorites, although trying to get emil at resistance has built some resentment..
Coincidentally just beat the game for my first time today, and it was a truly special experience.
Hopefully we get a new Nier game soon
    hopefully they make something like reincarnation 1.5 but not a cash grab
I remember when this game came out I was debating between it and Horizon. Decided to skip Horizon for Nier and I wasn't disappointed.
I remember dropping this game after the first mission and reaching the bunker because it didnt click with me yet, refunded it, didnt even consider playing it until it went on sale a month ago (which was about a year later) or so. Bought it again because i watched the first 5 episodes of the anime and thought why not give it a shot? Its super cheap and ive heard so many good things about it.

Jesus fuck was i wrong to have dropped the game back when i did. NieR: Automata became one of my favorite video game stories of all time by the true ending, and even now a month later it still has weight to me. I cant say for certain if its my number one in terms of story yet since it hasnt been super long since i completed the story and i usually dont fully realize things until way after the fact. 

One thing i can say though is it had one of the most emotionally heavy stories ive ever experienced in any medium and to this day i cant listen to Weight of The World without it drawing out some form of emotion from me. 

Not even a week after i finished the game i created a new video game ost playlist including a lot of NieR songs and went out to a book store after hearing about the YoRHa manga and bought both volumes that are out currently. I just finished the second volume last night and its made me appreciate all of the characters that are also in Automata even more than i already did. 

I legit fuckin love Automata and i havent even experienced any of the other games in its universe which probably says a lot about how well made the game is. Really hope the anime gets finished some day as well.
    2 years After having finished the game, i'm still listening to the OST...
All about this game is a masterpiece that will stay in our memories forever...
Hi OP, may i repost this to r/gaming? Or maybe you want to post it there as well. I feel this game is still underrated, and more people to know this game.
Happy to have convinced 3 people to buy it (or I gift it to them)
His wondrous grace has become a god!
Literally just bought the game yesterday... Could I have been the 7.5 millionth purchase? 😳😳😳
The legs on this game are incredible
Nier and drakengard deserves this and more love
Damn, back in the day, Nier:Automata was a niche game. Now it can be considered as triple A.

We deserve a sequel with 2B, 9S and A2! Please Yoko Taro san.
I just beat it for the first time on second play through now and this is without a doubt one of the best games I’ve ever played.
Got my GotY copy a week ago. Platinumed it. Definitely one of my favorite games.
I convinced like four friends to play Nier and most of them loved the game
Glad it reached so many sales. 
Automata deserves everything. With its philosophy, metaphysics and music it certainly is the best game of all time (mind cannot be changed). It’s actually much more than just a game
Moreover
Remember what the man himself said?
He’d be more than willing to make a new Drakengard if they had enough money. 
Let’s hope Yoko Taro decides to pull through with it
And yet we get a crappy produce anime at least bring the switch dlc to other platforms
hope this means we get a new entry in the series, hopefully >!following 2B, 9S and A2. as ambiguous or poetic as the ending is, it means they can totally make a follow up sequel to their stories and having them as mascots of the next game will definitely drive sales!< and regarding what the story would be, i’m sure Yoko Taro will manage to think of something that works well
    Taro actually created a play script showcasing just what happened to them after ending E.

I would say that their story is over, by the looks of it.


I have no idea just what happened to A2 though. I don't know if she's still alive or not.
        just heard about this recently and will be checking it out, has it been confirmed to be canon from Taro himself?
            I believe so, yes.
                good to know, thanks
And still not another game lol
If they're thankful for my support then they'd give me two things: the switch exclusive content on PS4 so I can play as 2P, and the announcement of a sequel that continues 2B, 9S, and A2's story. I know the latter may never happen but I can still dream
We thank you devs for this amazing game following the prequel !!
    What prequal?
        Replicant is the prequel lol
            Replicant is the first game not the prequel
                Then the game that released before and made a remaster of it. Anyways I’m thanking the devs for what we got !!!
But the real question is will they ever support the PC release? Oh wait, the community has already done that for them.
Glory to Mankind
Man, wish I picked up this game while it was still on sale.
This game deserves it, praise
Peak designer for a peak game
I bought 3 copies.
I’m doing my part.
I bought 2 copies, and i have the black box edition :)
There is over 30k+ downloads from a torrenting site for this. Don't ask me how I know this
Now if only it had 4k support added on PS4Pro/PS5 for the PS4 version of the game...
Is there breakdown by percentage base on platforms?
I helped with two! <3
Bought it for pc, switch and ps4. Best investment of my life.
Ur welcome I bought a switch copy
I guess it's time for Nier Automata: UE5 Remaster Ver. 28374828194o5i5i4i2i19
Awesome news for an amazing game
I'm glad I was able to contribute, even if it just was once.

Also, is your name a reference to the Illusive Man from Mass Effect 2?
wait it’s a game?
It kinda feels like we aren't gonna get a sequel, i mean humans are dead, androids are gonna break down and also die eventually, most threats were dealt with during the story, we see what happened to emil. I think yoko taro tied the bow on the nier world. I hope he does something with drakengard or creates something new.
Reward us with a sequel or spin off. I own it on every console
I’m so glad I’m a part of that 7.5 million
If only the game ran without mods.....
This masterpiece deserves so much more...
WHERES NIER AUTOMATA 2 AT YOKO TARO?!
ik this is just out of context, but this just makes the fact that totk has sold 10M copies in 3 days , just incredible, nier automata is still a masterpiece
I passed 60 hours and I am in love with this game, should I buy Replicant next?
Its time for a Nier 3 >.<
I've bought it twice. I was a fan of drakengard 1 and 2 when it was released. Haven't played the rest and saw automata for the switch. Fell in love with the game that I bought a second copy for my bros.
I contributed twice
    I contributed thrice 🥰
        I contributed nice
        I bought like 9 copies fuck ALL of you fake fans
            Nice to know some people are still gatekeepers over what "truly" makes you a real fan. You don't need to own 9 copies or more to be a true fan. Buying the same game for all of my devices is enough for me to say I love the game. But you do you lol.
                Redditors needing tone indicators for things like this is the most hilarious thing ever
                    Well I do enjoy making people laugh. In all fairness, it's hard to tell what is or isn't sarcasm over the internet for some people. A lot of people on the spectrum also don't understand sarcasm, so yeah. There's also that lol. Have a wonderful day 🥰❤️
                        It's ok. It is reddit after all and you don't know what kind of character is saying things lol
                Smartest redditor
                    okay??? idk why i'm getting downvotes tho lmao
Sadly, because Nier/DoD series are a ultra niche games, same as Gravity Rush Series (PS4), Puppeteer (PS3), Deadly Premonition (PS3)...I would have wanted many more people to know these beautiful works.
    Not that niche if it sold 7.5 million copies
        Nier is an anomaly because it's a sleeper hit. The general rule is that a game will make most of its sales in the first few weeks, but in the case of Nier Automata it was "just" 1.5 million copies in the first 2 months. The idea that the game would stay in the public consciousness so consistently to sell another 6 millions is truly surprising.
            Having better, more lively gameplay thanks to PlatinumGames' work is a very decisive factor in the overall success of the game. Otherwise, N:A would only be remembered in the same level as the original Nier, or Drakengard 3.

        7.5m in a span of 6 years...every damn FIFA, CoD sells million in a couple of months, this the sad true.
            It's one title though that's really damn good.   Those games are franchises
                nier isn't a franchise?
            Those, imho, meaningless games beat this meaningful game.


Edit: actually i never play CoD, if there is any of it's title is good, lmk, thanks!
                There’s a few good titles that came out over 10 years like World at War, Black ops 1 & 2, cod 4 and mw2 (2009) but they’re nothing crazy. Just some dumb fun with an enjoyable campaign
                    Infinite Warfare is also really good
                    Ah right.. i always want to play World War one but in the end never play lol no story in CoD i guess?
                        Nothing close to something like nier haha but those 5 story’s are fine
            Yeah, but it's the difference between between fine dining and mcdonalds. Not the best metaphor.
            FIFA and CoD don't win GOTY either
        It started out niche. Word of mouth has had it defying all conventionally known standards for videogames. Most game sales happen in the first two weeks. NieR Automata has been steadily selling ~1 million per year. It defies all logic.
            It's people discovering the ass pics and going down the rabbit hole.
                The design of the next main character is going be the hardest thing for the developers lmao. 2B’s design was so good it made a multitude of people buy the game on that alone.
                    Hire Loomy for character designer
        I played it on Xbox Game Pass so I never actually bought it. I wonder how they take those numbers into account
            They said sold and shipped, so it’d have to ignore game pass downloads. If it was presented as “the amount of players who have played the game” then game pass numbers would be included.
    Automata isnt ultra niche, i mean its accessible and enjoyable to many JRPG players, even for more classic RPG players, i wasnt into JRPGs before playing with nier, not because i didnt liked them, just because i didnt really know them, Nier was the bridge that connected me to this genre of games. 

And i do belive its less niche than Elden Ring ^^
    Gravity rush is one of the most unique games I’ve ever played and I hope they make a third installment like they said they would potentially would see you as the PS five is a thing now
        The Gravity Rush studio is dead. Sony killed them off.

Some of them work for Team Asobi but it's only a 40 people strong team, a good number of the Devs got absorbed by Nintendo/Monolith Soft.
The environment designer of Bloodborne is now working on games like Xenoblade and Zelda TOTK to give an example.

The rest is working on a multiplat horror game as an independent studio.
    I thought I was the only person who knew Gravity Rush existed, god both games were so good :(
There’s nothing to be amazed by really, Automata released in the same year as Breath of the Wild, which sold almost 4 times as many copies as it.
    One teaches you about individualism and self identity the other is just entertainment. One of my first game I played was Majora Mask at 8 years old which changed my life I’m not bashing the game. But one is more powerful and you can called it more than a video game. I think the idea of it “selling more” doesn’t fit in the argument or it’s irrelevant in this case.
        The “argument of selling more” is used in this case because Nier’s popularity is a joke compared to Zelda’s, I’m not saying which one is better, I like Automata more actually, but Nier wouldn’t ever win GotY in the same year a Zelda game releases, simple as that.

GotY doesn’t depend on what me or you like more, it depends on having a humongous amount of praise and success. God of War was a more popular franchise than Red Dead Redemption in 2018, that’s why it won over RDR2. Both had similar amounts of praise, but GoW won because it’s more popular.
            But if you’re saying sells than yea obviously Zelda wins because of its history and nostalgia it has on players. As well it appeals to a universal crowd even parents who have no idea about gaming bought it for there young one. I highly doubt parents will buy Nier for their kids.

Again you’re right it’s a popularity contest but let’s be real with each other one is more powerful than the other.
                Absolutely
Just look at the games that came out in 2017 it was one of the most stacked years for gaming
GOTY is a joke anyway
What got game of the year on that year?
    Breath of the wild. It was a really, really stacked year
        On the plus side, being able to beat a Zelda game in the music category is an accomplishment in and of itself.
            Tbh, even thoough I really like BOTW ost it was far from the strongest of the licence.
It won for music though and it definitely deserved that.
I was hoping for DOS 2 to win, but yeah, NA deserved the win as well.

I liked BOTW but it just doesn't compare to DOS and NA.
Because of the BOTW. I enjoy playing nier but tbh it's not good as BOTW.
    To each it’s own but Nier explore philosophy and took it to another level.
        I must say that I do not quite agree with the idea that it took philosophy to an another level. It can seem very deep and attractive to an outsider because it looks at the existential concepts that have been processed almost since the emergence of philosophy from a different perspective and blends them with their own lore.  This is quite enough for the gaming industry and may even set a new bar.  However, when taken alone, it did not bring a new mind-blowing solution to the old problems nor extended them. Just enough to keep you playing and finishing it 4/5 times.
            The point is that N:A utilized its own video game medium to drive home such preexisting philosophical subject matter to a more modern audience (and the degree of accessibility it comes), taking to account the contemporary systemic and societal factors associated with such audiences.
            To each it’s own but explore blood borne or any souls game.
            I would agree, but as someone who was familiar with the concepts explored in NieR Automata, playing it made me "get it". I think there is an emotional dimension to every philosophical concept, that goes beyond superficial knowledge, something where you intrinsically understand where an argument is coming from and where it wants to go. NieR in general does that pretty well
    It's all subjective, I put nier in top 5 games I've ever played, and BOTW is something like 6.5/10 for me.
        Yeah, for me it’s easily top 3, and number 1 depending on how recently I’ve thought about it/played it/watched a video about it. BotW is great and all as a Nintendo (game) fan, but one extensive playthrough of the game was enough for me. It doesn’t have good enough story, mechanics, or combat for me to keep coming back to it like I do with Nier.
    Botw is only impressive for what it did for open worlds on the hardware it was on.

Botw doesn't even get a stake in the same league as automata for things like story, narrative, characters, music, gameplay diversity, genre diversity, art direction, character design, VA work, animations, combat, lore, quest design, or overall writing.

Strip the word "zelda" from BOTW and it wouldn't sell half as well as it did. It rode the Fandoms nostalgia hard-on to success. It's the same principle as call of duty, where the name of the franchise self perpetuates the sales and success of the franchise, despite whether or not the latest installment is good. 

And it wasn't just BOTW affecting automata sales. Automata had to fight tooth and nail against what would be a playstation exclusive hit release called horizon zero dawn. One of the highest critically acclaimed indie games ever called hollow knight, and it had to fight against the fact that NieR was by then a no name franchise nobody had heard of before except the extremely niche gestalt and drakengard Fandom, so Automata had to fight for its success all on its own without the support of the series earlier installments to act as a backbone.

Zelda had a massive Fandom and series to act as its support, horizon was a playstation exclusive pushing  graphics at the time, so of course it was gonna sell well. Hollow knight came out at the start of the year and was building momentum and popularity the whole year. 

Automatas release date was almost a death sentence on paper, but it made its own hit success and the franchise is now alive again because of it.
        Wow preach! Would it support your argument that that in my 25 years of gaming this is the only game to ever make me cry. Well actually cry 4 times. Till this day I listen to the soundtrack! It’s my favorite album of all time! It beat my old favorite album In rainbows by Radiohead.
        You gave very good reasons, but after finishing nier, I never felt the need to go back and play it again. The same is not true for zelda.  I can't help but go back and play it almost every year. I guess we look for different things in our games and that's okay.
        BOTW did not relied on nostalgia, a lot of locations of other Zelda games are reduced to ruins that you can casually find and aren't relevant to the game, some characters return while the majority are only mentioned vaguely, the game itself is practically different from any other Zelda games and a lot of things didn't return.

The game success is thanks to the freedom you have to do ANYTHING and the huge amount of ways you can interact with the beautiful world around you. I love Nier as much as the next person, being my favorite game and franchise but there's no need to shit on another masterpiece.
            Not shitting on it, putting it in its place in respect to the better game. 

Sure the gameplay was nice, but would you mind speaking loudly and clearly into the microphone when you admit this. 

What was the main reason BOTW sold well?

Say it with me now. It's because it had the word Z-E-L-D-A in the title. 

Zelda is the synonym for many people's childhood. Aka nostalgia. 

Fandom that started as children + new installment to a beloved classic franchise that hasn't gotten a game in forever + is the spearhead showcase game for a new NINTENDO platform = $$$$$ success, overt blind praise. 

You can do a lot in zelda BOTW, but it's still *just* zelda. There's no remarkable story to be had, no extremely well written characters to be experienced, no innovation in genre diversity, passable animations, an OST that's good by normal standards, but outclassed by NieR standards. 


It's a lot like skyrim. Huge expanse of unexplored possibilities at the time it came out, rejuvenating life in the genre and becoming a genre defining game. 

But fast forward past its recency bias and prime days, and then people realize the story and characters are shallow, the music is nostalgic but now outclassed by better compositions in the industry, the combat becomes dated, and all around there's much left to be desired. 

Hense  1 reason why skyrims modding community is the biggest around. 
Great for a first time experience, remove those glory goggles though and you just have a lot left to wish for. 


It's a good rpg game, but you can't just be "a good rpg game" for a conversation where the competition is a game like automata. You gotta have more substance than just a good gameplay experience. You need deeper stuff. 

Unless you're just really against dark stories/sad stuff, then even NieR replicant, a game that's a parody of zelda is already better than zelda since it does exactly what im saying zelda games are missing. Only downside is the gameplay is worse than BOTW. But it's beating BOTW in basically every other category. 

So if a dark zelda parody is better than zelda itself, then I can't take someone seriously or respect their opinion when they say BOTW is better than Automata, a game that's better than the game that's parodying zelda, that's already better than zelda. 

Once again I'm not shitting on BOTW, it's great for what it is,  but an opinion of it being better than Automata is so misplaced and jarring that it can't be ignored. Not by me.
                >Say it with me now. It's because it had the word Z-E-L-D-A in the title

No, that's not true, at all. It's a factor? Yes, but i can use this same argument with every successful franchise in history and it will quickly prove itself to be wrong because it doesn't matter how famous you are if your game is shit, is shit. It's not the same thing. BOTW would not have been THIS successful if it wasn't a pretty damn good game, period.

>But fast forward past its recency bias and prime days, and then people realize the story and characters are shallow, the music is nostalgic but now outclassed by better compositions in the industry, the combat becomes dated, and all around there's much left to be desired. 

The characters aren't shallow, Link alone loses a lot of nuance because the translation to english fucked things up, like having the quest journal being writing in his perspective with his comments instead of a generic list of objectives. The combat is not dated because just like Nier, you don't just hit and dodge so this point doesn't make sense. I'm not sayings BOTW is perfect anyway, it isn't.

>Once again I'm not shitting on BOTW, it's great for what it is, but an opinion of it being better than Automata is so misplaced and jarring that it can't be ignored. Not by me.

You're not imparting justice by defending it, Yoko Taro isn't going to come and congratulate you. There's no "better game", BOTW and Automata can't even begin to be compared because their goals and effects are so vastly different that this entire conversation is pointless because it's reduced to personal preference, that's why i am discussing it with you, because you made no sense trying to "Putting it in it's place in respect to the better game"

>You can do a lot in zelda BOTW, but it's still just zelda. There's no remarkable story to be had, no extremely well written characters to be experienced, no innovation in genre diversity, passable animations, an OST that's good by normal standards, but outclassed by NieR standards. 

And? The gameplay is extremely fun, the story is alright, the game innovated upon every other Zelda game and in how to build a open world that actually let's you do things instead of marking everything the devs want you to see, the music is good that does it's job, it doesn't need to "outclass" anything.

"BOTW is good but NieR is better" is basically what I'm against, not only is personal preference it also doesn't matter, if it's good it's good, it doesn't need to be better than every game in existence. Like it or not, BOTW is a masterpiece of open world game, freedom and gameplay, this doesn't negate NieR being a masterpiece of storytelling, music and gameplay integration on the story itself.
                >TW, it's great for what it is,  but an opinion of it being better than Automata is so misplaced and jarring that it can't be ignored. Not by me.

Zelda was never a great selling franchise. BotW definitely didn't sell that well because of the name. For comparison Skyward Sword sold less than 4M on the Wii.
                    Very late reply on my part. But I'm not saying that zelda sold as insanely well as call of duty or gta, etc. I'm saying it's name carries more weight and has a broader fanbase and nostalgia to pull from. 

Nier series was essentially unknown until automata. It was the definition of cult classic or cult series. Very obscure. 

Zelda has always been one of the most iconic well known Nintendo series. Not Mario or sonic levels. But it firmly established itself in gaming culture as an iconic series. 

Hype around botw was insane. 
Automata didn't have such hype because it had no name to back it up to make people excited, since old NieR sold like shite and didn't become a cultural hit in gaming. 

It did have a lot of interest though. Just not hype. 

Nostalgia didn't sell botw alone, but it really contributed a lot to it. It already had a big fanbase of people who grew up playing zelda games that were hyped for it. 

My argument is simply that nostalgia helped sell a lot of botw copies, and that same nostalgia also creates a clouded judgement bias on people's opinions of the actual game.
Persona 5 is a visual novel not a game
    It’s got at least 50 hours of turn based jrpg gameplay, it’s definitely a game even if you don’t think vns count
        Not to mention the dungeon crawling
    Oh hell no, at least half the game is action based dungeon crawling.
    By this logic Final Fantasy games are visual novels.
    You must be thinking of P3P
Same here plus Xenoblade 1. I got the Wii Version, the 3DS version and the Definitive Edition for the Switch lol.
Completely agree with this 100percent.
SE: Sequel??? How about 1million more crossovers?
I understand the desire, but at the same time I have my doubts another NieR would be as good. I mean, they could just make a sequel to continue the story, but another title wouldn't be able to repeat the same storytelling devices that Automata did without feeling like a rehash. Well, I suppose the same could be said about Replicant, but I feel like Replicant/Gestalt was obscure enough that Automata got away with it.
    In Yoko Taro's style, it will probably never be a DIRECT sequel, but a story in the future of the same universe, where probably 2B and 9S are legends and like Adam and Eve for the future generations. I'm fine with that, as long as the spirit and feel of the Nier franchise is kept.
    Of course it’ll be good if taro makes it
Isn't Reincarnation the sequel? Idk, I haven't played Reincarnation yet.
    It's a mobile game
        True, but it's also canon.
Though I should say that I'd also love a new game on console and PC. Mobile games aren't my cup of tea either.
        if you like it or not, its the sequel
    More of a spinoff than a sequel
    No one knows how it fits into the universe. Not a direct sequel at the very least.
Played this on PS4 and then again on Switch and sacrificed my save file both times. The help I got during those credits was desperately needed. Not sure about the mackerel tho. Will have to try that one.
Dude, spoilers
    I don't really think so but I guess I'll mark it as such
        I sacrificed mine. I hope someone here benefits from it.
        That’s like… the biggest spoiler. I mean, it’s completely out of context but as soon as someone gets to the right place they’ll know what you meant and it would ruin it.
            I might have missed something because I can't see how knowing that ruins anything. I actually don't remember exactly when it happens. I guess I need to play the game again :)
                I just feel like knowing it’s coming, when you get to the end and >!you get other people to help you!< it would be pretty obvious what’s going to happen and rob it of a lot of the emotional impact.
Played it for the first time on the Xbox too, and I really wish I had a physical copy on the shelf

I printed out a little picture of the cover and put it inside the box for Replicant to make up for that though
I regret bought this game only for $20 during sale. I redeemed my guilts by buying Replicant v.12247's cheaper collector edition (because the other one was not released in my country), even though i don't really like that CE, but ok, i hope i contribute a bit to Yoko Taro future development.
So not the pc version.
    The PC version works really well on Linux, I think the issue is Windows
        Game's been fixed to not have FAR as a requirement __FOUR YEARS LATER AFTER IT'S RELEASE__
            I recently finished this game on PC. So... Yeah... Hehe
        Nice to know, I'll have to pick it up!
There's already a prequel
    No, there isn't. A prequel, by definition, is something that released later than the thing it's a prequel to. Drakengard 3 is a prequel to Drakengard 1 for example. NieR: Automata however is a sequel to Gestalt/Replicant.
        Yeah that's not the case lol replicant is a prequel to automata
            Nier replicant came out first then automata, replicant isn’t a prequel it is the previous game in the series
            Please explain your rationale
            Bruh...
            so confident, but so wrong
        A pre-make?
    I wouldn't consider Replicant to be a prequel to automata. World building? yes. Replicant is a story in it's own right (and a damn good one too).

A prequel would be something like the formation of Yorha, a sequel would be what happens after the true ending of automata.

Before all the lore masters chime in with "we already know, it's in obscure comic/short story/radio play/program to a music concert" I'm aware, but I would like to see it all collected in game form.
        Replicant was also just the previous game. It came out before Automata.
        There isn't enough lore imo to make a whole game out of the formation of yorha. If i remember right yorha was only 5 or so years old when automata starts. A game detailing one of emils adventures during the few thousands years between replicant and nier would be awesome, or a game set right after the queen beast falls upon tokyo and the red eye legion starts to appear would be cool too.
hopefully they make something like reincarnation 1.5 but not a cash grab
2 years After having finished the game, i'm still listening to the OST...
All about this game is a masterpiece that will stay in our memories forever...
Taro actually created a play script showcasing just what happened to them after ending E.

I would say that their story is over, by the looks of it.


I have no idea just what happened to A2 though. I don't know if she's still alive or not.
    just heard about this recently and will be checking it out, has it been confirmed to be canon from Taro himself?
        I believe so, yes.
            good to know, thanks
What prequal?
    Replicant is the prequel lol
        Replicant is the first game not the prequel
            Then the game that released before and made a remaster of it. Anyways I’m thanking the devs for what we got !!!
I contributed thrice 🥰
    I contributed nice
    I bought like 9 copies fuck ALL of you fake fans
        Nice to know some people are still gatekeepers over what "truly" makes you a real fan. You don't need to own 9 copies or more to be a true fan. Buying the same game for all of my devices is enough for me to say I love the game. But you do you lol.

        Yeah, but it's the difference between between fine dining and mcdonalds. Not the best metaphor.
        FIFA and CoD don't win GOTY either
    It started out niche. Word of mouth has had it defying all conventionally known standards for videogames. Most game sales happen in the first two weeks. NieR Automata has been steadily selling ~1 million per year. It defies all logic.
        It's people discovering the ass pics and going down the rabbit hole.
            The design of the next main character is going be the hardest thing for the developers lmao. 2B’s design was so good it made a multitude of people buy the game on that alone.
                Hire Loomy for character designer
    I played it on Xbox Game Pass so I never actually bought it. I wonder how they take those numbers into account
        They said sold and shipped, so it’d have to ignore game pass downloads. If it was presented as “the amount of players who have played the game” then game pass numbers would be included.
Automata isnt ultra niche, i mean its accessible and enjoyable to many JRPG players, even for more classic RPG players, i wasnt into JRPGs before playing with nier, not because i didnt liked them, just because i didnt really know them, Nier was the bridge that connected me to this genre of games. 

And i do belive its less niche than Elden Ring ^^
Gravity rush is one of the most unique games I’ve ever played and I hope they make a third installment like they said they would potentially would see you as the PS five is a thing now
    The Gravity Rush studio is dead. Sony killed them off.

Some of them work for Team Asobi but it's only a 40 people strong team, a good number of the Devs got absorbed by Nintendo/Monolith Soft.
The environment designer of Bloodborne is now working on games like Xenoblade and Zelda TOTK to give an example.

The rest is working on a multiplat horror game as an independent studio.
I thought I was the only person who knew Gravity Rush existed, god both games were so good :(
One teaches you about individualism and self identity the other is just entertainment. One of my first game I played was Majora Mask at 8 years old which changed my life I’m not bashing the game. But one is more powerful and you can called it more than a video game. I think the idea of it “selling more” doesn’t fit in the argument or it’s irrelevant in this case.
    The “argument of selling more” is used in this case because Nier’s popularity is a joke compared to Zelda’s, I’m not saying which one is better, I like Automata more actually, but Nier wouldn’t ever win GotY in the same year a Zelda game releases, simple as that.

GotY doesn’t depend on what me or you like more, it depends on having a humongous amount of praise and success. God of War was a more popular franchise than Red Dead Redemption in 2018, that’s why it won over RDR2. Both had similar amounts of praise, but GoW won because it’s more popular.
        But if you’re saying sells than yea obviously Zelda wins because of its history and nostalgia it has on players. As well it appeals to a universal crowd even parents who have no idea about gaming bought it for there young one. I highly doubt parents will buy Nier for their kids.

Again you’re right it’s a popularity contest but let’s be real with each other one is more powerful than the other.
            Absolutely
Breath of the wild. It was a really, really stacked year
    On the plus side, being able to beat a Zelda game in the music category is an accomplishment in and of itself.
        Tbh, even thoough I really like BOTW ost it was far from the strongest of the licence.
To each it’s own but Nier explore philosophy and took it to another level.
    I must say that I do not quite agree with the idea that it took philosophy to an another level. It can seem very deep and attractive to an outsider because it looks at the existential concepts that have been processed almost since the emergence of philosophy from a different perspective and blends them with their own lore.  This is quite enough for the gaming industry and may even set a new bar.  However, when taken alone, it did not bring a new mind-blowing solution to the old problems nor extended them. Just enough to keep you playing and finishing it 4/5 times.
        The point is that N:A utilized its own video game medium to drive home such preexisting philosophical subject matter to a more modern audience (and the degree of accessibility it comes), taking to account the contemporary systemic and societal factors associated with such audiences.
        To each it’s own but explore blood borne or any souls game.
        I would agree, but as someone who was familiar with the concepts explored in NieR Automata, playing it made me "get it". I think there is an emotional dimension to every philosophical concept, that goes beyond superficial knowledge, something where you intrinsically understand where an argument is coming from and where it wants to go. NieR in general does that pretty well
It's all subjective, I put nier in top 5 games I've ever played, and BOTW is something like 6.5/10 for me.
    Yeah, for me it’s easily top 3, and number 1 depending on how recently I’ve thought about it/played it/watched a video about it. BotW is great and all as a Nintendo (game) fan, but one extensive playthrough of the game was enough for me. It doesn’t have good enough story, mechanics, or combat for me to keep coming back to it like I do with Nier.
Botw is only impressive for what it did for open worlds on the hardware it was on.

Botw doesn't even get a stake in the same league as automata for things like story, narrative, characters, music, gameplay diversity, genre diversity, art direction, character design, VA work, animations, combat, lore, quest design, or overall writing.

Strip the word "zelda" from BOTW and it wouldn't sell half as well as it did. It rode the Fandoms nostalgia hard-on to success. It's the same principle as call of duty, where the name of the franchise self perpetuates the sales and success of the franchise, despite whether or not the latest installment is good. 

And it wasn't just BOTW affecting automata sales. Automata had to fight tooth and nail against what would be a playstation exclusive hit release called horizon zero dawn. One of the highest critically acclaimed indie games ever called hollow knight, and it had to fight against the fact that NieR was by then a no name franchise nobody had heard of before except the extremely niche gestalt and drakengard Fandom, so Automata had to fight for its success all on its own without the support of the series earlier installments to act as a backbone.

Zelda had a massive Fandom and series to act as its support, horizon was a playstation exclusive pushing  graphics at the time, so of course it was gonna sell well. Hollow knight came out at the start of the year and was building momentum and popularity the whole year. 

Automatas release date was almost a death sentence on paper, but it made its own hit success and the franchise is now alive again because of it.
    Wow preach! Would it support your argument that that in my 25 years of gaming this is the only game to ever make me cry. Well actually cry 4 times. Till this day I listen to the soundtrack! It’s my favorite album of all time! It beat my old favorite album In rainbows by Radiohead.
    You gave very good reasons, but after finishing nier, I never felt the need to go back and play it again. The same is not true for zelda.  I can't help but go back and play it almost every year. I guess we look for different things in our games and that's okay.
    BOTW did not relied on nostalgia, a lot of locations of other Zelda games are reduced to ruins that you can casually find and aren't relevant to the game, some characters return while the majority are only mentioned vaguely, the game itself is practically different from any other Zelda games and a lot of things didn't return.

The game success is thanks to the freedom you have to do ANYTHING and the huge amount of ways you can interact with the beautiful world around you. I love Nier as much as the next person, being my favorite game and franchise but there's no need to shit on another masterpiece.
        Not shitting on it, putting it in its place in respect to the better game. 

Sure the gameplay was nice, but would you mind speaking loudly and clearly into the microphone when you admit this. 

What was the main reason BOTW sold well?

Say it with me now. It's because it had the word Z-E-L-D-A in the title. 

Zelda is the synonym for many people's childhood. Aka nostalgia. 

Fandom that started as children + new installment to a beloved classic franchise that hasn't gotten a game in forever + is the spearhead showcase game for a new NINTENDO platform = $$$$$ success, overt blind praise. 

You can do a lot in zelda BOTW, but it's still *just* zelda. There's no remarkable story to be had, no extremely well written characters to be experienced, no innovation in genre diversity, passable animations, an OST that's good by normal standards, but outclassed by NieR standards. 


It's a lot like skyrim. Huge expanse of unexplored possibilities at the time it came out, rejuvenating life in the genre and becoming a genre defining game. 

But fast forward past its recency bias and prime days, and then people realize the story and characters are shallow, the music is nostalgic but now outclassed by better compositions in the industry, the combat becomes dated, and all around there's much left to be desired. 

Hense  1 reason why skyrims modding community is the biggest around. 
Great for a first time experience, remove those glory goggles though and you just have a lot left to wish for. 


It's a good rpg game, but you can't just be "a good rpg game" for a conversation where the competition is a game like automata. You gotta have more substance than just a good gameplay experience. You need deeper stuff. 

Unless you're just really against dark stories/sad stuff, then even NieR replicant, a game that's a parody of zelda is already better than zelda since it does exactly what im saying zelda games are missing. Only downside is the gameplay is worse than BOTW. But it's beating BOTW in basically every other category. 

So if a dark zelda parody is better than zelda itself, then I can't take someone seriously or respect their opinion when they say BOTW is better than Automata, a game that's better than the game that's parodying zelda, that's already better than zelda. 

Once again I'm not shitting on BOTW, it's great for what it is,  but an opinion of it being better than Automata is so misplaced and jarring that it can't be ignored. Not by me.
            >Say it with me now. It's because it had the word Z-E-L-D-A in the title

No, that's not true, at all. It's a factor? Yes, but i can use this same argument with every successful franchise in history and it will quickly prove itself to be wrong because it doesn't matter how famous you are if your game is shit, is shit. It's not the same thing. BOTW would not have been THIS successful if it wasn't a pretty damn good game, period.

>But fast forward past its recency bias and prime days, and then people realize the story and characters are shallow, the music is nostalgic but now outclassed by better compositions in the industry, the combat becomes dated, and all around there's much left to be desired. 

The characters aren't shallow, Link alone loses a lot of nuance because the translation to english fucked things up, like having the quest journal being writing in his perspective with his comments instead of a generic list of objectives. The combat is not dated because just like Nier, you don't just hit and dodge so this point doesn't make sense. I'm not sayings BOTW is perfect anyway, it isn't.

>Once again I'm not shitting on BOTW, it's great for what it is, but an opinion of it being better than Automata is so misplaced and jarring that it can't be ignored. Not by me.

You're not imparting justice by defending it, Yoko Taro isn't going to come and congratulate you. There's no "better game", BOTW and Automata can't even begin to be compared because their goals and effects are so vastly different that this entire conversation is pointless because it's reduced to personal preference, that's why i am discussing it with you, because you made no sense trying to "Putting it in it's place in respect to the better game"

>You can do a lot in zelda BOTW, but it's still just zelda. There's no remarkable story to be had, no extremely well written characters to be experienced, no innovation in genre diversity, passable animations, an OST that's good by normal standards, but outclassed by NieR standards. 

And? The gameplay is extremely fun, the story is alright, the game innovated upon every other Zelda game and in how to build a open world that actually let's you do things instead of marking everything the devs want you to see, the music is good that does it's job, it doesn't need to "outclass" anything.

"BOTW is good but NieR is better" is basically what I'm against, not only is personal preference it also doesn't matter, if it's good it's good, it doesn't need to be better than every game in existence. Like it or not, BOTW is a masterpiece of open world game, freedom and gameplay, this doesn't negate NieR being a masterpiece of storytelling, music and gameplay integration on the story itself.
            >TW, it's great for what it is,  but an opinion of it being better than Automata is so misplaced and jarring that it can't be ignored. Not by me.

Zelda was never a great selling franchise. BotW definitely didn't sell that well because of the name. For comparison Skyward Sword sold less than 4M on the Wii.
                Very late reply on my part. But I'm not saying that zelda sold as insanely well as call of duty or gta, etc. I'm saying it's name carries more weight and has a broader fanbase and nostalgia to pull from. 

Nier series was essentially unknown until automata. It was the definition of cult classic or cult series. Very obscure. 

Zelda has always been one of the most iconic well known Nintendo series. Not Mario or sonic levels. But it firmly established itself in gaming culture as an iconic series. 

Hype around botw was insane. 
Automata didn't have such hype because it had no name to back it up to make people excited, since old NieR sold like shite and didn't become a cultural hit in gaming. 

It did have a lot of interest though. Just not hype. 

Nostalgia didn't sell botw alone, but it really contributed a lot to it. It already had a big fanbase of people who grew up playing zelda games that were hyped for it. 

My argument is simply that nostalgia helped sell a lot of botw copies, and that same nostalgia also creates a clouded judgement bias on people's opinions of the actual game.
It’s got at least 50 hours of turn based jrpg gameplay, it’s definitely a game even if you don’t think vns count
    Not to mention the dungeon crawling
Oh hell no, at least half the game is action based dungeon crawling.
By this logic Final Fantasy games are visual novels.
You must be thinking of P3P
In Yoko Taro's style, it will probably never be a DIRECT sequel, but a story in the future of the same universe, where probably 2B and 9S are legends and like Adam and Eve for the future generations. I'm fine with that, as long as the spirit and feel of the Nier franchise is kept.
Of course it’ll be good if taro makes it
It's a mobile game
    True, but it's also canon.
Though I should say that I'd also love a new game on console and PC. Mobile games aren't my cup of tea either.
    if you like it or not, its the sequel
More of a spinoff than a sequel
No one knows how it fits into the universe. Not a direct sequel at the very least.
I don't really think so but I guess I'll mark it as such
    I sacrificed mine. I hope someone here benefits from it.
    That’s like… the biggest spoiler. I mean, it’s completely out of context but as soon as someone gets to the right place they’ll know what you meant and it would ruin it.
        I might have missed something because I can't see how knowing that ruins anything. I actually don't remember exactly when it happens. I guess I need to play the game again :)
            I just feel like knowing it’s coming, when you get to the end and >!you get other people to help you!< it would be pretty obvious what’s going to happen and rob it of a lot of the emotional impact.
The PC version works really well on Linux, I think the issue is Windows
    Game's been fixed to not have FAR as a requirement __FOUR YEARS LATER AFTER IT'S RELEASE__
        I recently finished this game on PC. So... Yeah... Hehe
    Nice to know, I'll have to pick it up!
No, there isn't. A prequel, by definition, is something that released later than the thing it's a prequel to. Drakengard 3 is a prequel to Drakengard 1 for example. NieR: Automata however is a sequel to Gestalt/Replicant.
    Yeah that's not the case lol replicant is a prequel to automata
        Nier replicant came out first then automata, replicant isn’t a prequel it is the previous game in the series
        Please explain your rationale
        Bruh...
        so confident, but so wrong
    A pre-make?
I wouldn't consider Replicant to be a prequel to automata. World building? yes. Replicant is a story in it's own right (and a damn good one too).

A prequel would be something like the formation of Yorha, a sequel would be what happens after the true ending of automata.

Before all the lore masters chime in with "we already know, it's in obscure comic/short story/radio play/program to a music concert" I'm aware, but I would like to see it all collected in game form.
    Replicant was also just the previous game. It came out before Automata.
    There isn't enough lore imo to make a whole game out of the formation of yorha. If i remember right yorha was only 5 or so years old when automata starts. A game detailing one of emils adventures during the few thousands years between replicant and nier would be awesome, or a game set right after the queen beast falls upon tokyo and the red eye legion starts to appear would be cool too.
just heard about this recently and will be checking it out, has it been confirmed to be canon from Taro himself?
    I believe so, yes.
        good to know, thanks
Replicant is the prequel lol
    Replicant is the first game not the prequel
        Then the game that released before and made a remaster of it. Anyways I’m thanking the devs for what we got !!!
I contributed nice
I bought like 9 copies fuck ALL of you fake fans
    Nice to know some people are still gatekeepers over what "truly" makes you a real fan. You don't need to own 9 copies or more to be a true fan. Buying the same game for all of my devices is enough for me to say I love the game. But you do you lol.
        Redditors needing tone indicators for things like this is the most hilarious thing ever
            Well I do enjoy making people laugh. In all fairness, it's hard to tell what is or isn't sarcasm over the internet for some people. A lot of people on the spectrum also don't understand sarcasm, so yeah. There's also that lol. Have a wonderful day 🥰❤️
                It's ok. It is reddit after all and you don't know what kind of character is saying things lol
        Smartest redditor
            okay??? idk why i'm getting downvotes tho lmao
Nier is an anomaly because it's a sleeper hit. The general rule is that a game will make most of its sales in the first few weeks, but in the case of Nier Automata it was "just" 1.5 million copies in the first 2 months. The idea that the game would stay in the public consciousness so consistently to sell another 6 millions is truly surprising.
    Having better, more lively gameplay thanks to PlatinumGames' work is a very decisive factor in the overall success of the game. Otherwise, N:A would only be remembered in the same level as the original Nier, or Drakengard 3.
    reddit API access ended today, and with it the reddit app i use Apollo, i am removing all my comments, the internet is both temporary and eternal.  -- mass edited with redact.dev
7.5m in a span of 6 years...every damn FIFA, CoD sells million in a couple of months, this the sad true.
    It's one title though that's really damn good.   Those games are franchises
        nier isn't a franchise?
    Those, imho, meaningless games beat this meaningful game.


Edit: actually i never play CoD, if there is any of it's title is good, lmk, thanks!
        There’s a few good titles that came out over 10 years like World at War, Black ops 1 & 2, cod 4 and mw2 (2009) but they’re nothing crazy. Just some dumb fun with an enjoyable campaign
            Infinite Warfare is also really good
            Ah right.. i always want to play World War one but in the end never play lol no story in CoD i guess?
                Nothing close to something like nier haha but those 5 story’s are fine

            Very late reply on my part. But I'm not saying that zelda sold as insanely well as call of duty or gta, etc. I'm saying it's name carries more weight and has a broader fanbase and nostalgia to pull from. 

Nier series was essentially unknown until automata. It was the definition of cult classic or cult series. Very obscure. 

Zelda has always been one of the most iconic well known Nintendo series. Not Mario or sonic levels. But it firmly established itself in gaming culture as an iconic series. 

Hype around botw was insane. 
Automata didn't have such hype because it had no name to back it up to make people excited, since old NieR sold like shite and didn't become a cultural hit in gaming. 

It did have a lot of interest though. Just not hype. 

Nostalgia didn't sell botw alone, but it really contributed a lot to it. It already had a big fanbase of people who grew up playing zelda games that were hyped for it. 

My argument is simply that nostalgia helped sell a lot of botw copies, and that same nostalgia also creates a clouded judgement bias on people's opinions of the actual game.
Not to mention the dungeon crawling
True, but it's also canon.
Though I should say that I'd also love a new game on console and PC. Mobile games aren't my cup of tea either.
if you like it or not, its the sequel
I sacrificed mine. I hope someone here benefits from it.
That’s like… the biggest spoiler. I mean, it’s completely out of context but as soon as someone gets to the right place they’ll know what you meant and it would ruin it.
    I might have missed something because I can't see how knowing that ruins anything. I actually don't remember exactly when it happens. I guess I need to play the game again :)
        I just feel like knowing it’s coming, when you get to the end and >!you get other people to help you!< it would be pretty obvious what’s going to happen and rob it of a lot of the emotional impact.
Game's been fixed to not have FAR as a requirement __FOUR YEARS LATER AFTER IT'S RELEASE__
    I recently finished this game on PC. So... Yeah... Hehe
Nice to know, I'll have to pick it up!
Yeah that's not the case lol replicant is a prequel to automata
    Nier replicant came out first then automata, replicant isn’t a prequel it is the previous game in the series
    Please explain your rationale
    Bruh...
    so confident, but so wrong
A pre-make?
Replicant was also just the previous game. It came out before Automata.
There isn't enough lore imo to make a whole game out of the formation of yorha. If i remember right yorha was only 5 or so years old when automata starts. A game detailing one of emils adventures during the few thousands years between replicant and nier would be awesome, or a game set right after the queen beast falls upon tokyo and the red eye legion starts to appear would be cool too.
I believe so, yes.
    good to know, thanks
Replicant is the first game not the prequel
    Then the game that released before and made a remaster of it. Anyways I’m thanking the devs for what we got !!!
Nice to know some people are still gatekeepers over what "truly" makes you a real fan. You don't need to own 9 copies or more to be a true fan. Buying the same game for all of my devices is enough for me to say I love the game. But you do you lol.
    Redditors needing tone indicators for things like this is the most hilarious thing ever
        Well I do enjoy making people laugh. In all fairness, it's hard to tell what is or isn't sarcasm over the internet for some people. A lot of people on the spectrum also don't understand sarcasm, so yeah. There's also that lol. Have a wonderful day 🥰❤️
            It's ok. It is reddit after all and you don't know what kind of character is saying things lol
    Smartest redditor
        okay??? idk why i'm getting downvotes tho lmao
Having better, more lively gameplay thanks to PlatinumGames' work is a very decisive factor in the overall success of the game. Otherwise, N:A would only be remembered in the same level as the original Nier, or Drakengard 3.
reddit API access ended today, and with it the reddit app i use Apollo, i am removing all my comments, the internet is both temporary and eternal.  -- mass edited with redact.dev
It's one title though that's really damn good.   Those games are franchises
    nier isn't a franchise?
Those, imho, meaningless games beat this meaningful game.


Edit: actually i never play CoD, if there is any of it's title is good, lmk, thanks!
    There’s a few good titles that came out over 10 years like World at War, Black ops 1 & 2, cod 4 and mw2 (2009) but they’re nothing crazy. Just some dumb fun with an enjoyable campaign
        Infinite Warfare is also really good
        Ah right.. i always want to play World War one but in the end never play lol no story in CoD i guess?
            Nothing close to something like nier haha but those 5 story’s are fine
Yeah, but it's the difference between between fine dining and mcdonalds. Not the best metaphor.
FIFA and CoD don't win GOTY either
It's people discovering the ass pics and going down the rabbit hole.
    The design of the next main character is going be the hardest thing for the developers lmao. 2B’s design was so good it made a multitude of people buy the game on that alone.
        Hire Loomy for character designer
They said sold and shipped, so it’d have to ignore game pass downloads. If it was presented as “the amount of players who have played the game” then game pass numbers would be included.
But if you’re saying sells than yea obviously Zelda wins because of its history and nostalgia it has on players. As well it appeals to a universal crowd even parents who have no idea about gaming bought it for there young one. I highly doubt parents will buy Nier for their kids.

Again you’re right it’s a popularity contest but let’s be real with each other one is more powerful than the other.
    Absolutely
Tbh, even thoough I really like BOTW ost it was far from the strongest of the licence.
The point is that N:A utilized its own video game medium to drive home such preexisting philosophical subject matter to a more modern audience (and the degree of accessibility it comes), taking to account the contemporary systemic and societal factors associated with such audiences.
To each it’s own but explore blood borne or any souls game.
I would agree, but as someone who was familiar with the concepts explored in NieR Automata, playing it made me "get it". I think there is an emotional dimension to every philosophical concept, that goes beyond superficial knowledge, something where you intrinsically understand where an argument is coming from and where it wants to go. NieR in general does that pretty well
Not shitting on it, putting it in its place in respect to the better game. 

Sure the gameplay was nice, but would you mind speaking loudly and clearly into the microphone when you admit this. 

What was the main reason BOTW sold well?

Say it with me now. It's because it had the word Z-E-L-D-A in the title. 

Zelda is the synonym for many people's childhood. Aka nostalgia. 

Fandom that started as children + new installment to a beloved classic franchise that hasn't gotten a game in forever + is the spearhead showcase game for a new NINTENDO platform = $$$$$ success, overt blind praise. 

You can do a lot in zelda BOTW, but it's still *just* zelda. There's no remarkable story to be had, no extremely well written characters to be experienced, no innovation in genre diversity, passable animations, an OST that's good by normal standards, but outclassed by NieR standards. 


It's a lot like skyrim. Huge expanse of unexplored possibilities at the time it came out, rejuvenating life in the genre and becoming a genre defining game. 

But fast forward past its recency bias and prime days, and then people realize the story and characters are shallow, the music is nostalgic but now outclassed by better compositions in the industry, the combat becomes dated, and all around there's much left to be desired. 

Hense  1 reason why skyrims modding community is the biggest around. 
Great for a first time experience, remove those glory goggles though and you just have a lot left to wish for. 


It's a good rpg game, but you can't just be "a good rpg game" for a conversation where the competition is a game like automata. You gotta have more substance than just a good gameplay experience. You need deeper stuff. 

Unless you're just really against dark stories/sad stuff, then even NieR replicant, a game that's a parody of zelda is already better than zelda since it does exactly what im saying zelda games are missing. Only downside is the gameplay is worse than BOTW. But it's beating BOTW in basically every other category. 

So if a dark zelda parody is better than zelda itself, then I can't take someone seriously or respect their opinion when they say BOTW is better than Automata, a game that's better than the game that's parodying zelda, that's already better than zelda. 

Once again I'm not shitting on BOTW, it's great for what it is,  but an opinion of it being better than Automata is so misplaced and jarring that it can't be ignored. Not by me.
    >Say it with me now. It's because it had the word Z-E-L-D-A in the title

No, that's not true, at all. It's a factor? Yes, but i can use this same argument with every successful franchise in history and it will quickly prove itself to be wrong because it doesn't matter how famous you are if your game is shit, is shit. It's not the same thing. BOTW would not have been THIS successful if it wasn't a pretty damn good game, period.

>But fast forward past its recency bias and prime days, and then people realize the story and characters are shallow, the music is nostalgic but now outclassed by better compositions in the industry, the combat becomes dated, and all around there's much left to be desired. 

The characters aren't shallow, Link alone loses a lot of nuance because the translation to english fucked things up, like having the quest journal being writing in his perspective with his comments instead of a generic list of objectives. The combat is not dated because just like Nier, you don't just hit and dodge so this point doesn't make sense. I'm not sayings BOTW is perfect anyway, it isn't.

>Once again I'm not shitting on BOTW, it's great for what it is, but an opinion of it being better than Automata is so misplaced and jarring that it can't be ignored. Not by me.

You're not imparting justice by defending it, Yoko Taro isn't going to come and congratulate you. There's no "better game", BOTW and Automata can't even begin to be compared because their goals and effects are so vastly different that this entire conversation is pointless because it's reduced to personal preference, that's why i am discussing it with you, because you made no sense trying to "Putting it in it's place in respect to the better game"

>You can do a lot in zelda BOTW, but it's still just zelda. There's no remarkable story to be had, no extremely well written characters to be experienced, no innovation in genre diversity, passable animations, an OST that's good by normal standards, but outclassed by NieR standards. 

And? The gameplay is extremely fun, the story is alright, the game innovated upon every other Zelda game and in how to build a open world that actually let's you do things instead of marking everything the devs want you to see, the music is good that does it's job, it doesn't need to "outclass" anything.

"BOTW is good but NieR is better" is basically what I'm against, not only is personal preference it also doesn't matter, if it's good it's good, it doesn't need to be better than every game in existence. Like it or not, BOTW is a masterpiece of open world game, freedom and gameplay, this doesn't negate NieR being a masterpiece of storytelling, music and gameplay integration on the story itself.
