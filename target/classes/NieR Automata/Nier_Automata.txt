'''''Nier: Automata'''''{{efn|{{nihongo|Stylized as '''''NieR:Automata'''''|ニーア オートマタ|Nīa Ōtomata|lead=yes}}}} is a 2017 [[action role-playing game]] developed by [[PlatinumGames]] and published by [[Square Enix]]. It is a sequel to ''[[Nier]]'' (2010), itself a spin-off of and sequel to the ''[[Drakengard]]'' series. ''Nier: Automata'' was originally released for the [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Windows]] via [[Steam (service)|Steam]], and an [[Xbox One]] port was published the following year. A [[Nintendo Switch]] port was released in 2022.
''Nier: Automata'' is set during a [[proxy war]] between alien-created [[Machines (Nier: Automata)|Machines]] and human-crafted androids, focusing on the actions of combat android [[2B (Nier: Automata)|2B]], scanner android 9S, and rogue prototype A2. The story requires multiple playthroughs, with each playthrough revealing new story elements. The gameplay combines [[Role-playing video game|role-playing]] elements with action-based [[hack-and-slash]] combat. It also includes gameplay from other [[video game genres]], with elements varying from [[shoot 'em up]] to [[text adventure]].
Production began in 2014, with series creator [[Yoko Taro]], producer Yosuke Saito, and lead composer [[Keiichi Okabe]] reprising their roles in ''Nier''. [[Akihiko Yoshida]], known for his work in the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series, led character design. The goal was to make a sequel game that would be faithful to ''Nier'' while improving the combat system. Because the project was new to PlatinumGames, its staff faced multiple challenges when developing the gameplay and [[open-world]] environment. The story, which was written by Yoko, explores themes of finding value in life and the reasons people kill.
''Nier: Automata'' was announced at [[E3 2015]]; it received stage plays and novels expanding its narrative, and both [[downloadable content]] (DLC) and [[Crossover (fiction)|crossovers]] with other games were issued after its release. The game was localized by [[8-4]], translators of ''Nier''. Critics praised the game's story, themes, gameplay, and music; but drew criticism for some visual and technical problems. The PC release drew a mixed response due to technical issues that were not officially addressed until 2021. Sales surpassed expectations and {{as of|2024|2|lc=y}}, the game had shipped {{nowrap|8 million}} copies worldwide.
== Gameplay ==
[[File:Nier Automata gameplay.jpg|thumb|left|Main character [[2B (Nier: Automata)|2B]] in combat with machine enemies|alt=A black-clad woman fights machine enemies in a ruined industrial environment.]]
''Nier: Automata'' is an [[action role-playing game]] (ARPG) in which players explore an [[open world]]. In addition to standard navigation on foot, the game features scenarios with flying [[mecha|mech]] battles, as well as a special item that can summon wild animals to ride. [[Non-playable character]]s (NPCs) found throughout the world offer quest objectives, and shops in hub locations sell various items, including consumables that recover [[health (gaming)|health]].
Combat uses a real-time action-based [[hack and slash]] system, using both light and heavy attacks and combining them into different [[Combo (video games)|combination]] attacks. The player can also evade incoming attacks, gaining invulnerability or counterattack bonuses based on timing. The player is assisted by a flying "Pod" robot which launches customizable ranged attacks varying from simple gunfire to heavy-hitting hammer attacks. The first protagonist [[2B (Nier: Automata)|2B]] alternates between two weapons, the second protagonist 9S combines light attacks with hacking into enemies, and the final protagonist A2 can sacrifice health to briefly boost her attack power. There are four classes of weapons available; [[short sword]]s, [[Longsword|long swords]], [[bracer]]s, and [[spear]]s. Attacks with different weapon types can be charged and launched for increased damage.
Players earn [[experience point]]s through combat, increasing their health, defense, and attack power. Character customization is handled through attribute-changing items called chips. Chips can alter the HUD, add new abilities, and grant status buffs to the player characters. The number of chips that can be installed at any one time is limited to the number of slots a character has. Chips can either be purchased at shops or collected from defeated enemies. If the player character dies, they [[Spawning (video gaming)|respawn]] at their previous save point. The player character can then find their original body and either attempt to repair it or retrieve items and experience from it to gain a bonus. If the repair attempt is successful, the body is resurrected as a temporary ally, but if the attempt is unsuccessful, it becomes an enemy the player can fight. With online features enabled, the bodies of other players can also be retrieved or revived where they died.
At certain points, the gameplay changes to reflect different [[video game genres]], such as [[shoot 'em up]] and [[text adventure]] segments; many of these are indicated by a shift from the normal [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person perspective]] to a [[Video game graphics#Top-down perspective|top-down]] or [[side-scrolling]] view. Some areas also include [[platform game|platforming]] elements, requiring the player to jump between platforms or over obstacles. ''Automata'' has 26 different endings; five main endings lettered A to E, and 21 additional endings lettered F through Z. These additional endings, which act as [[game over]] events, are triggered by performing certain actions, failing to progress the narrative, or losing certain battles. There are four difficulties available to the player which can be changed at any time, with "Easy" giving access to chips which automate functions such as attacking, dodging and pod fire.
== Synopsis ==
=== Setting and characters ===
''Nier: Automata'', which shares the post-apocalyptic setting of ''[[Nier]]'', takes place thousands of years after the original game's events. The ''Nier'' fictional universe exists in an alternative timeline within the ''Drakengard'' series. While carrying over the ''Drakengard'' tradition of a dark atmosphere and branching storylines, there is no direct narrative connection between ''Nier: Automata'' and the rest of the series. The story is set in 11945 AD, and revolves around a [[proxy war]] between the human-made [[Android (robot)|androids]] and an invading army of [[Machines (Nier: Automata)|Machines]] from another world. Though they are prohibited from having emotions and lack true names, each android has a distinct personality. The "YoRHa" android forces are commanded from the Bunker, a reconnaissance base that orbits Earth. Fending off the Machines, the YoRHa forces fight alongside pre-YoRHa Earth androids known as the [[Resistance movement|Resistance]].
The game's initial protagonist is [[2B (Nier: Automata)|2B]] (short for "YoRHa No. 2 Type B"), a YoRHa combat android whose main traits are her calm and composure. 2B is accompanied by 9S (short for YoRHa No.9 Type S), a male "scanner" reconnaissance android who displays more emotion than other YoRHa units. The game later introduces another player character named A2, an obsolete attack android who often acts alone. The androids are supported by Pod 042 and Pod 153, floating, box-like robots that act as ranged weapons. The game's primary antagonists are Adam and Eve, twin controllers of the Machine Network; and the Red Girls, a construct within the Machine Network. Other characters include the Commander, YoRHa's top officer; the resistance leader Anemone; Pascal, a machine who dislikes conflict and wishes for peace; Devola and Popola, early androids who suffer discrimination from the actions of their model series; and the original ''Nier'' character Emil, who has lost his memories in the intervening years after the original game.
=== Plot ===
The story of ''Nier: Automata'' is told across multiple playthroughs and alternating character perspectives. 2B and 9S also encounter A2, a rogue YoRHa android. Adam is killed by 2B after he captures 9S. During his recuperation, 9S discovers a glitch in YoRHa's servers when syncing himself and 2B, and learns humanity was extinct long before the alien invasion. Humanity's last remnant is a Moon-based server holding their genetic remains. YoRHa perpetuates the myth of their survival to maintain morale and give androids a "god" to fight for. With Adam dead, Eve goes mad with grief and drives connected Machines into a frenzy. 2B and 9S kill Eve, but 9S becomes infected with Eve's logic virus, forcing 2B to kill him. 9S's consciousness survives within the local Machine Network.
The third playthrough begins as YoRHa launches a full-scale invasion. A logic virus attack, which is enabled by the glitch 9S previously discovered, corrupts every YoRHa unit except 2B and the restored 9S. 2B and 9S are separated in the aftermath, and 2B is infected with the logic virus. A2 discovers 2B, who asks her to take her place. An ignorant 9S sees A2 [[Coup de grâce|mercy-killing]] 2B and swears revenge on her. Simultaneously, a tower created by the Machines rises from the land, separating the two before they can fight. A fortnight later, the perspective splits between A2 and 9S. A2, the survivor of a test run for YoRHa, begins empathising with the Machines; she witnesses the destruction of Pascal's village, then the village's "children" committing suicide out of fear when they are attacked again. Pascal begs A2 to either wipe his memory or kill him; A2 can perform either task or leave him. An increasingly unbalanced 9S investigates the tower's resource-gathering platforms, fighting Machine remnants and learning the tower is designed to launch a missile at the Moon server. Devola and Popola sacrifice themselves to open the tower, with 9S and A2 both entering. During these events and their final confrontation, the two learn that YoRHa was designed to lose and perpetuate the myth of humanity, and that the Machine Network are using YoRHa to further their evolution; each side has trapped the other in an eternal cycle of war. A2 further learns that 2B's real designation was "2E", an "executioner" unit assigned to repeatedly kill 9S whenever he discovers the truth about humanity, and that 9S was aware of this.
9S—now insane and infected with the logic virus—challenges A2 to a fight, prompting the player to choose a character. If A2 is picked, she saves 9S and sacrifices herself to destroy the tower. If 9S is chosen, the two androids kill each other; in his final moments, he is offered the option of joining with the now-peaceful Machine Network, as the tower has changed its function to launch an ark containing the Machine memories to find a new world. Once both of these endings are unlocked, Pods 042 and 153 defy their orders to delete YoRHa's data, prompting the player to destroy the credits in a shoot 'em up section. Despite the possibility that 2B, 9S and A2 will repeat events, the Pods have faith they will forge a new future for themselves. The player is then given the option to sacrifice their save data to help other players.
Returning characters Emil, Devola and Popola have separate optional story arcs. Devola and Popola were ostracized and programmed to feel endless guilt after their model series caused humanity's extinction in ''Nier''. They stay at the Resistance camp doing the riskier jobs, and aid the YoRHa androids until helping 9S at the tower. Emil lost his memories due to copying himself to fight the aliens. A group of those copies, gone mad from losing their sense of self, act as a secret [[boss battle]]. After the current character wins the fight, Emil dies after remembering his now-dead friends.
== Development ==
After the release of ''Nier'', director [[Yoko Taro]] and [[Square Enix]] producer Yosuke Saito wanted to create a sequel. Saito spoke to assistant producer Yuki Yokoyama, who was unwilling due to low sales of ''Nier''. After the positive fan reception of ''Nier'', however, both Square Enix and the lead staff who worked on the original game were willing to continue the ''Nier'' [[intellectual property]] (IP) but wanted to create a better, more-action-oriented gameplay experience. They contacted [[PlatinumGames]], which had developed a reputation for high-quality action games such as ''[[Bayonetta (video game)|Bayonetta]]'' (2009) and ''[[Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance]]'' (2013). The two companies agreed to collaborate on the sequel, provided Yoko would be its director and that he would be present to help with production. The latter condition required Yoko to move from Tokyo to Osaka, where PlatinumGames was located. Although Yoko was initially uneasy about the collaboration, he became confident in PlatinumGames due to their excitement to work on a ''Nier'' game, and their promise to remain faithful to the original game. Designer Takahisa Taura also joined the team due to his long-time desire to create a ''Nier'' sequel. PlatinumGames handled primary development of the game while Square Enix supported the project with additional staff and sound design.
Initially, Yoko said they planned to build a ''[[FarmVille]]'' (2009)-inspired game for [[Mobile game|mobile]] platforms or the [[PlayStation Vita]]. The team instead shifted development to the [[PlayStation 4]]. Saito and Eijiro Nishimura co-produced the project. Development began in 2014, and included six months of pre-production. At first, the relationship between Yoko and PlatinumGames staff was fraught, mainly because Yoko's freelance status led to different daily schedules. To reduce the scheduling conflicts, the team organized a system of "free time" where Yoko would be available to work. The team studied feedback from both fans and critical reviews of ''Nier,'' and concluded they would need to improve the gameplay, graphics, and character designs. They also carried over aspects of ''Nier'' that were well-received, such as the game's music and complex story. PlatinumGames did most of the development at its offices in Osaka and Tokyo, and was supported by outside staff such as Yoko.
=== Scenario and themes ===
[[File:Beauvoir Sartre - Che Guevara -1960 - Cuba.jpg|thumb|The narrative of ''Nier: Automata'' references numerous famous philosophers and names some Machine characters after them; cited examples are [[Simone de Beauvoir]] (left) and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] (centre). |alt=A man and a woman, both middle aged, sit and talk with a younger man, all facing away from the camera.]]
Yoko was the primary scenario writer. This script took the most work of all his games to date, and while the story only experienced minor changes through development, it was delivered nearly five months late. Yoko was supported by sub-writers Yoshiho Akabane from the company Highestar, and Hana Kikuchi, who worked on ''Nier'' and ''[[Drakengard 3]]'' (2013). When creating ''Nier: Automata''{{'s}} story, Yoko was hesitant about adding Devola and Popola due to their role in the original game but he later decided to include them. According to Yoko, while the scenario of ''Nier'' is "wet" in its emotional content, he wanted ''Nier: Automata'' to have a "dry" narrative about confronting prejudice and unfairness in the world. He also wanted to leave more room for the player to interpret the story, feeling he had gone too far when humanizing the antagonists of ''Nier'', and decided to strike a different balance in the sequel. According to Saito, a lot of time and effort went into creating the story and character interactions so they would match those of ''Nier''.
As with the original ''Nier'', multiple endings were created, but the conditions for reaching them were not as stringent as the first game. Yoko's desire was to make the game's conclusion happy, which prompted scepticism from other staff members. The happy ending from Yoko's perspective was the fifth and final ending, which he only created after the character motivations logically led him to the concept. The final ending featured a shooting sequence where the player fought their way through the closing credits, which symbolized the characters breaking out of a known system to find the hope of a new future. The team also included the option for player to sacrifice their save data to aid other random players in the closing credit sequence, a mechanic similar to that of the original ''Nier''. This ability for players to help each other was inspired by a [[Coca-Cola]] campaign, where drink machines in [[India]] were connected via livestream to machines in [[Pakistan]], encouraging the two peoples to overcome their political rivalry. The campaign made a strong impression on Yoko, who adapted the idea into in-game messages of encouragement from players across the world.
The team defined the game's central theme as "''[[wikt:足掻き|agaku]]''", a Japanese word meaning "to struggle out of a bad situation". Saito also said the story is about love, which he felt was unusual for a story about robots, which are typically written as non-emotional. Yoko used the androids' and Machines' reverence for the long-extinct humanity to show how people's sense of self and worth is necessarily founded on belief in something else. The negative influence of human history on the factions reflect Yoko's views on people continuing to fight and create boundaries between themselves despite their advancement. A recurring element in Yoko's earlier work is his examination of reasons people kill and the impact of killing on others—this stems from his observation of people coming to enjoy killing enemies in games, which suggested to him something is wrong or missing inside them. Yoko said the narrative's darkness reflects the inherent darkness of reality. The narrative references numerous influential philosophers and thinkers, with Machine characters taking notable names such as supporting character Pascal ([[Blaise Pascal]]), boss character Simone ([[Simone de Beauvoir]]), and NPC Jean-Paul ([[Jean-Paul Sartre]]). Yoko used books by [[Will Buckingham]] and [[Nigel Benson]], which explain philosophy and psychology in understandable language, as a reference for the narrative.
=== Art and game design ===
''Nier: Automata'' was Taura's first [[role-playing game]] (RPG), with his prior experience focused on action game development. Taura managed the action-combat system and designer Isao Negishi created the RPG elements. According to Negishi and lead programmer Ryo Onishi, creating a game that was faithful to ''Nier'' was difficult and required a change from the style of their earlier titles. For the combat system, the team took the systems used in ''Nier'' and blended in elements from other titles by PlatinumGames. Taura's main design goal was to improve the combat system over that of the original and weave it into the story. The basic battle system was completed in two months, then expanded and adjusted during development. While designing the game's RPG elements, the staff at PlatinumGames were partially inspired by ''[[The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt]]'' (2015), including the high standard of its [[Quest (video gaming)|sidequests]]. The sections of ''Nier: Automata'' in which the perspective shifts to a side-scrolling perspective were inspired by the ''[[Castlevania]]'' series, of which Taura was a fan. For the final boss battle in which the player chooses between 9S and A2, the developers considered removing character abilities based on their choice but decided against it.
To make ''Nier: Automata'' beginner-friendly, the perspective was designed to automatically assume "comfortable" angles during combat. Also to this end, the developers included mechanics that would allow both casual and experienced action gamers to enjoy the game. It was the studio's first attempt at an open world; while its previous titles had used a story-driven linear structure, ''Nier: Automata'' has large environments that are linked with seamless transitions. Negishi noted the lower concentration of enemies in the world compared to those of earlier PlatinumGame titles, a necessity due to the game's open nature. By including fewer enemies, the team gave players the opportunity to "enjoy the still beauty of the game's desolate world". The developers based the shooting elements on bullet hell games, and decided combat should include multiple camera perspectives. The plug-in chips are an updated version of the Words used in ''Nier'', and are themed around the premise of androids. The developers also suggested including multiplayer modes but this suggestion was not developed beyond the concept phase.
Using feedback about the game's original character designs, [[Akihiko Yoshida]] was engaged as main character designer. Saito originally wanted to bring back D.K, the character designer of ''Nier'', but D.K had broken his elbow and was unable to draw, so he recommended Yoshida for the post. The developers thought Yoshida would be too busy to contribute, but he was willing to join the project due to fans of ''Nier'' working at his company, CyDesignation. Yoshida joined the company later in the character design process, so Taro gave him a general guideline of sleek designs with black as the dominant color. PlatinumGames staff had difficulty making the character models seem "alive" due to their mechanical nature. Unlike ''Nier'', which has two different protagonist designs for different markets, the team committed to a high-quality JRPG character design that would be consistent across regions. According to staff, Yoshida's art design ensured a consistent aesthetic for the characters. The Commander, Adam, and Eve were designed by Yuya Nagai. Square Enix artist Toshiyuki Itahana redesigned Devola and Popola. Concept art for the game's enemies was handled by Hisayoshi Kijima, while Kazuma Koda, Yasuyuki Kaji, and Shohei Kameoka made the environmental artwork in collaboration with Yoko. The developers worked to build settings that would resemble real-world places players would visit.
=== Music and sound design ===
{{Main|Music of Nier}}
Composer [[Keiichi Okabe]], who worked on both ''Nier'' and ''Drakengard 3'', worked on ''Nier: Automata'' as lead composer with other members of his studio band Monaca; Keigo Hoashi, Kuniyuki Takahashi, and Kakeru Ishihama. The score, which was influenced by classical music, recalls elements of ''Nier'' such as that game's sense of melancholy. Whereas ''Nier'' is built around grasslands and villages, ''Nier: Automata'' includes a more mechanical and brutal environment, which is reflected in the musical score. Okabe created a score with a more-open world in mind, composing songs that segue into each other depending on situation and environment. The music was balanced using the [[digital audio workstation]] (DAW) [[Pro Tools]].
Emi Evans provided vocals for the soundtrack, as she had done for [[Music of Nier|''Nier''{{'s}} soundtrack]]. Shotaro Seo provided additional male vocals. Nami Nakagawa, Evans, and J'Nique Nicole formed a three-part chorus for some of the music, including the game's boss theme. Several songs from the ''Nier'' soundtrack were adapted for ''Nier: Automata''. Different versions of the theme song "Weight of the World" were performed by Nicole, Evans and [[Marina Kawano]]. The final ending's version had the development team performing the chorus.
Masato Shindo was the game's sound designer. Creating an echo effect was difficult due to the scale of the open world; Shindo designed a system that would manage echoes in real time, depending on the player's surroundings. Sound was implemented by Masami Ueda; it was a greater amount of work than he had experienced on previous projects. Ueda's previous encounters and good working relationship with Okabe helped the smooth implementation of the game's sound.
The soundtrack album of ''Nier: Automata'' was released on March 29, 2017. The first-print copies of the soundtrack include an additional sixteen-track album subtitled ''Hacking Tracks'' that contains musical variations for hacking segments.
=== Localization ===
The company [[8-4]], which had localized ''Nier'', also localized the English-language version of ''Nier: Automata''. According to Yoko, 8-4 changed elements of the script for each region because some of the concepts in the Japanese script are difficult to understand if directly translated. The aim was to create a script that would appeal to players around the world. Because 8-4 had worked with Yoko on ''Nier'' and ''Drakengard 3'', they were familiar with his writing style and found it easy to ask for clarification during translation. 8-4's biggest challenge was translating the android dialogue, as it was difficult to balance their purported emotionlessness with their highly emotional relationships and distinct personalities. While 9S was already written to be more emotive in Japanese, 2B had to be rewritten so she appears "droll" rather than emotionless in English.
The development team had notes about how to write each character; for example 9S would speak about things at length while 2B would be crisper. The team also made decisions around using regional accents to altering voice types. A cited instance of the latter was changing a character's high-pitched child voice to a more mature one to avoid annoyance to players. The team researched the game's philosophical themes to avoid mistakes in their writing. When the estate of philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre objected to the use of his name in the game, the character Sartre was renamed Jean-Paul in releases outside Japan. Cup of Tea Productions, which had worked on both ''Nier'' and ''Drakengard 3'', handled English dubbing.
== Release ==
In January 2014, after the release of ''Drakengard 3'', Yoko expressed an interest in making a second spin-off from the ''Drakengard'' series but did not specify whether it would be related to ''Nier''. In December of that year, he confirmed he was working on a new game but did not reveal more details. ''Nier: Automata'' was first announced at Square Enix's press conference at [[E3 2015]] under the provisional title ''Nier New Project'', with staff later confirming it was 10% complete. At the 2015 [[Paris Games Week]] trade show, Square Enix announced the game's official title and a provisional release date, and showed a gameplay trailer. Square Enix worked with Japanese rock band [[Amazarashi]], lead singer Hiromu Akita was a fan of ''Nier'', to produce a promotional song called "Inochi ni Fusawashii", which was inspired by the game's world. Yoko supervised the music video for "Inochi ni Fusawashii".
Yoko originally wanted to call the game "''Nier: Android''" but Square Enix rejected that title due to a possible trademark conflict with [[Google]]'s [[Android (operating system)|Android operating system]]. In trailers, the events surrounding 2B's fate and A2 replacing her in the story were obscured by using A2's early-game model for some footage when she is short-haired in-game. To mitigate competition, the team decided to delay ''Nier: Automata'' until late-2016 or early 2017, which also allowed the team more time to refine the game. Yoko appreciated having more time for the team to finish the game.
''Nier: Automata'' was released in Japan on February 23, 2017, coming in both standard editions and a Black Box Collector's Edition. The PS4 version was released in North America on March 7; and in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand on March 10. It also had a limited Day One edition, and a version of the Black Box Collector's Edition. The game was notably [[Review bombing|review-bombed]] in April 2017 by Chinese players demanding a translation of the game to [[Chinese language|Chinese]].
=== Ports and additional content ===
{{Anchor|3C3C1D119440927}}
''Nier: Automata'' was released for [[Windows]] personal computers (PCs) through [[Steam (service)|Steam]] on March 17, 2017. Both Square Enix and PlatinumGames were concerned about potential piracy of the PC version, which was expected to delay its release. In response to unaddressed graphical and performance issues with the port, an [[unofficial patch]] was created by fans. An official patch correcting these issues was released in July 2021. Saito stated that the release of a version for Xbox One was being considered, but later said it would not be developed due to low Xbox hardware sales in Japan and the wish to focus on a single console. An Xbox One version was later released worldwide on June 26, 2018; this version was subtitled ''Become as Gods Edition'', with QLOC porting this version to Windows for the [[Microsoft Store]] and [[Xbox Game Pass]] on March 18, 2021.
A [[Nintendo Switch]] port was released on October 6, 2022. Saito requested a Switch port to celebrate of the game's fifth anniversary after being impressed by ''[[Astral Chain]]'' (2019), which Taura directed. The port's developer [[Virtuos]] wanted to preserve as much of the game as possible but capped the [[frame rate]] at 30 fps and made a racing-based side quest less difficult. Saito was comfortable with the reduced frame rate due to ''Astral Chain''{{'s}} combat working at that frame rate. Sound compression was a challenge; the team optimized the sound and graphics engine to allow the highest-quality transfer onto the Switch's less-powerful hardware. The game's developers made scene-by-scene comparisons to ensure the final product was as close as possible to the other console versions. At Yoko's request, more costumes and items were included, some themed after the mobile game ''[[Nier Reincarnation]]''. The port's subtitle references the game's final ending.
A [[downloadable content]] (DLC) pack titled ''3C3C1D119440927'' was released on May 2, 2017; it includes additional costumes and accessories based on ''Nier'', aesthetic hair-customization options, new battle colosseums, and boss fights with Square Enix and PlatinumGames presidents Yosuke Matsuda and Kenichi Sato. The content was unlocked in-game from the chapter-selection screen, and requires data saved from a completed playthrough. The DLC was included in the Xbox One and Nintendo Switch releases, and in the ''Game of the YoRHa Edition'', which was released for the PlayStation 4 and Windows on February 26, 2019.

Sullivan called ''Nier: Automata'' "a crazy, beautiful, and highly entertaining journey full of nutty ideas and awesome gameplay".
Miguel Concepcion of ''[[GameSpot]]'' praised most of the game's elements, referring to its gameplay as "the closest thing there is to a spiritual successor to ''Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance''". Matulef called ''Nier: Automata'' "the most captivating game I've played in ages" despite rough edges. Thomas Whitehead, writing for ''[[Nintendo Life]]'', was positive about its presentation and design but noted some gameplay elements did not work as expected and lack depth. ''[[Game Informer]]'' reviewer Joe Juba wrote a lot of enjoyable elements in the game's narrative and gameplay are obscured by confusing or obtuse mechanics. ''[[PC Gamer]]''{{'}}s Andy Kelly was positive about the game but criticized the PC port for its graphical and technical issues at release.
The story and narrative themes were met with praise, though some reviewers found its pacing and presentation lacking. Both Meghan Sullivan of ''[[IGN]]'' and ''[[Eurogamer]]''{{'}}s Jeffrey Matulef found it difficult to relate to the android protagonists. Reviewers generally enjoyed the gameplay, but several critics felt that the combat lacked depth compared to previous PlatinumGames titles. The game's visuals were generally praised despite comments regarding occasional poor environment quality or visual spectacle. Recurring complaints arose from technical issues such as graphical pop-in, frame-rate drops, and long loading times. The game's music received unanimous acclaim. The Switch version was named as one of the best third-party ports to the system, despite reviewers noting some expected performance issues and downgraded graphics.

== Additional media ==
During ''Nier: Automata''{{'s}} six-month pre-production period, Yoko created a musical stage play called ''YoRHa'', which was performed in 2014. Set in the same universe as ''Nier: Automata'', it acts as a backstory for the characters A2 and Anemone. While the stage play predates the revelation of ''Nier: Automata'', the play's writer Asakusa Kaoru stated it would not exist without Yoko's vision for the world of ''Nier: Automata''. Yoko created the basic scenario while Kaoru wrote the script. For later productions, Yoko revised Asakusa's script to simplify the plot. He described the play as a spin-off of the overall universe. The team worked on additional stage productions including an all-male spin-off, a musical version, and a revised version of the original.
Multiple novels based on the in-game universe were written by Yoko and Jun Eishima, a regular collaborator for supplementary material related to the ''Drakengard'' series. The Black Box Collector's Edition included a novella retelling the events of ''Nier'' from the perspectives of characters Devola and Popola. ''Long Story Short'' is a novelization of the game's main events with additional commentary from the characters through monologues. ''Short Story Long'' is a compilation of earlier short stories in the ''Nier'' continuity, along with new stories related to the characters of ''Nier: Automata''. These two novels were published in North America by [[Viz Media]]. ''YoRHa Boys'', which is based on the male spin-off stage play, was written by Eishima and supervised by Yoko; it follows a group of male YoRHa units that are put into an experiment to collect behavioral data.
The stage play was adapted into a [[manga]] called''YoRHa Pearl Harbor Descent Record'', which began serialization on Square Enix;s ''[[Manga UP!]]'' online manga service. Megumu Soramichi illustrated the manga and Yoko supervised the story. Square Enix published the first volume of the manga in North America on December 13, 2022. During the fifth anniversary livestream of ''Nier: Automata'', an [[anime]] television series based on the game was announced. It is produced by Square Enix and [[Aniplex]], and animated by [[A-1 Pictures]]. The series, the title of which is ''[[Nier: Automata Ver1.1a]]'', premiered on January 7, 2023.
=== Crossovers ===
{{see also|Soulcalibur VI|Final Fantasy XIV: Shadowbringers}}
In October 2018, 2B was announced as a playable guest character DLC for [[Bandai Namco]]'s [[fighting game]] ''[[Soulcalibur VI]]''. Released on December 19, the DLC includes unique weapons and abilities, and an alternative white variation called "2P". Due to the inverted color scheme of 2B when playing as a second player, the name "2P" was adopted as a wordplay on "player two". Yoko Taro suggested the "P" stands for [[Panasonic]]. Characters from ''Nier: Automata'' were incorporated into a content patch for ''[[Final Fantasy XIV: Shadowbringers|Shadowbringers]]''. The scenario, which is titled ''YoRHa: Dark Apocalypse'', was outlined by Yoko and given to other writers. The three episodes of ''YoRHa: Dark Apocalypse'' are "The Copied Factory", "The Puppets' Bunker", and "The Tower at Paradigm’s Breach". DLC costumes and promotional appearances based on the characters of ''Nier: Automata'' have also appeared in third-party games ''[[Gravity Rush 2]]'' (2017), ''[[Star Ocean: Anamnesis]]'' (2018), ''[[Phantasy Star Online 2]]'' (2020), ''[[Fall Guys]]'' (2020), ''[[PUBG: Battlegrounds]]'' (2022), ''[[Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege]]'' (2022), ''[[Naraka: Bladepoint]]'' (2023), ''[[Goddess of Victory: Nikke]]'' (2023) and ''[[Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising]]'' (2023).
