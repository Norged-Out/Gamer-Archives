[[Happy 33rd birthday to the lovely Yui Ishikawa! The Amazing VA that voiced our YoRHa No. 2 Type B(2B)!]]





Her voice is so good. She's also Lucia from Punishing: Gray Raven! There is a Nier collab happening soon in Global, for those who might be interested to check it out.
    Wait really? Ive been waiting for this
    Damn she's everywhere, I was already surprised that she was enterprise and sharona
There is some weird levels of coincidence in the fact that my favorite game and my favorite anime have the same voice actor for the main character. My favorite anime is violet evergarden, and I had no idea she voice acted both of these characters.

The irony? I actually played the game in English AND watched violet evergarden in dub. Never seen or played either in Japanese dub. 

It's a cool coincidence, but it's ironic since I didn't experience either in Japanese. 

The English dub was simply too Supreme to pass up for me on either of these.
    Not that weird tbh. Voice Acting has a pretty rigid roster for their main casting list. Many of the big VA’s do basically every role.
    You should go rewatch it in sub. Ishikawa is amazing as Violet and her performance is probably one of her best.
        I dont really want to, VE is just one of those anime where the English is just better. But also more fitting since the characters are actually white for real, and are French specifically. Feels more "correct" to watch it dub.
            I watched it in German and also just fell in love with the ger dub. I don't think I'll enjoy it to the fullest extent with other dubs, so I absolutely get your point
                Yeah if the viewers mother tongue is good as a dub for an anime, it won't really be topped for them by other dubs because it's the most impressive to them naturally.

I'm 100% confident the Japanese dub is great for VE. 

But, im white, I speak English, the characters are white, they would realistically speak either English, French or German, or all 3, and it takes place in post ww1 France. It's a rare case where the anime feels like it was originally done in a dub other than Japanese, because it's just so fitting.
    Not super weird. I am the same way with Saori Hayami.
    In Violet's English dub, Claudia Hodgins shares 9S's voice actor. Same with Iris Cannary and A2. And Luculia and 2B. And Ann and Operator 6O.
It's a really great cast all around.
        Oh yeah I completely forgot how many VA from NieR are actually in VE. 

It almost convinces me that fate is real and I'm doomed to liking NieR related content. 

I mean the best character in skyrim is serana, and she's voiced by Laura bailey. Makes it hard to not hear kaines voice on serana. 

Anyways it's no wonder the dub us so good for VE and NieR:Automata. They share a lot of the same VAs so duh its good.
mikasa and 2b... she is a living legend
I really like both 2B and Enterprise and thought it was just a thing for silver haired characters, never realized the share a va until now
Wait?! She voices Nightingale from Arknights? Feeling like a fake fan now.
    The more you know.
    I knew she voiced Liskarm but I didn't know she voiced Nightingale as well. Probably because I dont have her lol.

Viloet, mikasa and 2b damm she's a goddess
Seems she’s regularly tapped for kuudere badasses
She voiced Mikasa and Miyoko? That's so cool. I've never played the game in Japanese but maybe I should.
    It’s excellent in both dubs
    I tried but they talk during walking/battles too much for me to enjoy it.
And Mikasa!  Man, I fall in love with this woman’s voice every time
It feels weird knowing she voiced Violet from VE because it seems like she has a knack for voicing murderous or formerly murderous characters who are pondering life.
Yooo, she voiced Mikasa, she has beautiful voice, happy birthday! Omedeto!
Wow, didn't know she voiced Sei. Learn something new everyday.
Anyone know what anime Tomoe is from? Seems super familiar but I just can’t remember.
2b
Happy birthday!!!

And thanks. For everything
She is a beast. Starting from such an young age and having a career rivaling voice actors in their 70s
Where's miyoko from? She looks familiar, but I can't put my finger on it
This fucking legend voiced Enterprise, 2B, Mikasa, Nightingale, Lucia and Violet! Everywhere I go I hear her voice and it has implanted itself into my brain. Bless this wonderful person!
I don't know any of these and haven't played the game with the jap dub. But it's a cool fact :D
She also voiced Rapi in Goddess of victory: NIKKE and Female Trailblazer (Stelle) in Honkai Star Rail
