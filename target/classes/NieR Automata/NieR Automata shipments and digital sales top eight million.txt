[[NieR Automata shipments and digital sales top eight million]]





I just want another Yoko Taro experience with even better gameplay and QoL than Automata. Ill be extremely happy if its a NieR continuation but also I'd be pretty chill with a new IP as long as it has the same ability to make me question my own existence and tear me to shreds by the end.
    Maybe it’s copium, but with everything that’s happened around Nier and Yoko taro in the past couple of years since Automata released I think it wouldn’t be crazy to expect square to invest a bit more heavily into Nier or stuff that Yoko taro wants to make. We got a remaster, a switch port, patch for pc, a mobile game, an anime and more. Yoko even got to collab with the FF team to make an actual raid. 

Dude is well known in the industry now as well as the NieR IP. It would be a huge fumble for square to not continue the franchise in some way. I don’t expect them to give him and his team FF level budget, but I would expect more than what they got for Automata given the success over the years. I just want Yoko to stop making mobile games lol.
        The mobile games part yes. I understand it brings in money. Konami is good at money as a main focus which makes sense need to get paid. But konamis past was great. Mgs is a landmark in good, story telling with commitment. Now they are remaking a game that should imo not be touched SH2 Is art as is (just my opinion, did not mean to sidetrack) now Konami makes tons off cheap thrills and gambling. I really really hope they don't do Yoko wrong as Konami did many employees as well as games. Chasing money instead of ones talent can be tempting but harmful to the medium. Sorry to type a lot. I keep having to say this i feel bad. Im a Japanese speaker and my English is not that great. I cant seem to be succinct (hope thats the word! Learned it today in English) and i type too many words. I hope Yoko has tons more experiences to share with us. And doesn't do what companies like the one i had mentioned Konami seeemed to do. I'm not sure if he's doing mobile for lot of $ or his true reasoning and dont wish to assume but I hope his creative, clearly understanding mind will push out more beautiful games and experiences.
        It's a good idea to consider the Concert, Replicant 1.22, NA 1.1a and Reincarnation, the manga all one big multimedia project. It's clear they were all being produced with each other in mind.

And holy heck Reincarnation hits right.   Honestly it would not have worked thematically as any other type of game it kind of has to be a gatcha.

If your looking for some Taro try his trilogy Voice of Cards.  I'm rather enjoying it.
    I want a Taro game with worse gameplay and QoL, drakengard 4 when
        I want a game made of only music sequences like as in Drag-on Dragoons ending that leads to Nier ending E. And the very much frustrating yet beautiful ending to Drag-on Dragoon 3s music section. The OST in these games is amazing. Its music you can feel. Not a full priced game as it's not a complicated concept at face. Just a hang out, keep the rhythm and hear angelic beauty music playing with stunning visuals kinda game on the side would be neat.
    Why do you hate yourself lol?
        Just the life of most nier fans :’)
        I don't think it is hate to ourselves, but the realizations to our life and surroundings. I appreciate both Replicant and Automata a lot because I realized many things of humanity and humanism which made me to write this on my phone's wallpaper


> Being alive is a gratitude, but being a human is a life worthy gratitude
        Are you quoting Eva? Or are you asking a person who said something why they hate themselves?. Just curious I learned how to use the word projection or projecting recently in English this type of verbiage you used leans towards a project/projection. Inner feelings. A simple response otherwise would be no response. But if its a quote from Eva and how it had inspiration at a great level on Nier and even Drag-On Dragoon especially I respect this.
            It's not that deep, I was just being sarcastic. Us Nier/Yoko Taro fans love his games. The comment I replied to said they wanted to question their existence and be ripped to shreds. You can actually say I'm projecting though because I'm definitely in the same Fandom lol.

    IDK about the gameplay, but there's the card game?
        Card game?
            https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/30738/Voice_of_Cards_Trilogy/
                How the fuck did I not know this existed???
                    It has angelic and some of the monster designs are strait from drakengard.   So let that simmer in your brain a bit
That made it the second most sold JRPG of the last generation,  just behind FFXV. Impressive.
    Persona 5 is at 9 milion I think.
        Does that include the ps3 sales or just the Royale alone?
            Just looked it up again and as of Dic last year is at 10 milion, but that is counting spinoff/sequel games which I think dont count, for just persona 5 and royal is 7.2 milion as of april 2023, so Automata is indeed in second place.
                Yea spinoffs definitely don't count. Whoever published that "count" you saw is dishonest as fuck xD
    what do you mean by "last generation"? Is there any specific timeline for these JRPGs?
        Console generations perhaps?
        Ps4 era
    That's crazy
    P5 sold 10 million copies by December 2023.

https://personacentral.com/p5-creator-messages/
        It just occurred to me that [Palworld sold 2x](https://pcgamer.com/palworld-has-now-sold-a-staggering-19-million-copies-an-unstoppable-rise-that-means-its-got-a-bigger-population-than-the-netherlands) the lifetimes sales of Persona 5 in two weeks.

Like how the actual fuckedy fuck did that even happen? As far as JRPGs go, P5 is fairly mainstream. How does a random indie survival game outperform *years* of that in mere weeks.

I think it's time for me to lie down on the floor and contemplate the concept of reality.
            people like pokemon and botw, combine them and throw in some fun mechanics and sell it at an affordable price point and somehow you get a recipe for massive success

at first a lot of people got interested in palworld because it's "pokemon with guns" but then realised that it's actually a decent game lol

heavily inspired by a lot of games for sure, but still fun
            P5 is somewhat mainstream in the rpg community, but the rpg community is already its own niche within the wider gaming community. P5 is literally a niche within a niche though, with its anime aesthetics and turn-based gameplay
            Palworld was a flash in the pan that capitalized on people’s (not-unwarranted) dissatisfaction with the biggest multimedia IP of all time. The inherent absurdity and shock factor of the concept also meant that tons of content creators hopped on it the moment it dropped, creating a ton of word-of-mouth. It sold insanely quickly but also plummeted in sales shortly after.
                I bought it, I played it, Hella fun, for now I am done till they add more content( like a lot more, I know they added some new pals and stuff).
        The P5 *series.* That is very different. It includes spinoffs. Read the article before you share it.
            Well I was aware of that lol. I just considered spinoff as sort of rereleases too, like DLCs.  Not sure why you're angry though. I do love both series
                Not angry, but pointing out misinformation.
        Persona 5 Subseries, Persona 5 Royal and Vanilla are on 7,2 Million.
            And even further around doesn’t allow people to just upgrade over dlc, so I would imagine quite a few royal purchases are by people who double dipped.
Funny coincidence i just bought Automata and Replicant remaster again on PC. I beat them on ps4 but it stopped working a while back, so i got em again
    Imagine if your were the guy to break it to 8mil
And still no console sequel…
    Just be patient. Making a masterpiece takes time.
        Sadly Yoko has said many times after reincarnation that the nier series is done. You never know things could change but a true sequel I doubt we will see. Drakengard 3 was a prequel even though it was numbered 3. Thats just not how Yoko tells stories lol.
            I’m pretty sure he’s also said if there’s enough money thrown at him he’ll happily continue the nier series. He’s a funny guy
            I bet he is going to make a sequel, but to the ending where 2b eats a fish and fucking dies
                Some say that's the loop that divergent Battler is from
            Always said that with the asterix of "unless I get a lot of money for it". Whenever he had more serious interviews his answer has been that its very likely, but not very soon. As long as him, Okabe and Saito are alive they said they would make another one, just that they need some time to gather inspiration for it.
            I know he said that, but there's a lot of stuff he's said that hasn't been true to try to throw us off. If he goes through with it, then I don't mind the games ending how they did. But if he makes another, then I will be so happy.
            When did he say this? Because the most recent comment regarding Nier was by the producer saying that as long as Yoko was alive there will be more nier stuff.
                Theres hundreds of articles on it as soon as they completed nier reincarnation. He is a cheeky guy things may change but he has pushed forward many other projects over the last 3 years with no emphasis on nier.
                    I feel like that would’ve been bigger news if he was actually being serious. Like I said, the bigger news was what yosuke saito the producer said. It would be a huge bag fumble on SE part to not invest in NieR now that people actually know and care about the franchise.
                        Theres literally thousands of articles on it was huge news at the time. SE doesnt own enough of the right to produce Nier without Taro. Im not saying it couldn’t happen, but SE has been consolidating its IP’s not expanding.
                            I know he has said similar things, but all of those were basically jokes and Yoko just being a silly little guy. If it’s something he said years ago I don’t think it matters that much considering the saito comment happened like last year.
            No that was a joke man
            That was obviously a joke.  Nier series is not done.
    There will never be a NieR Automata 2. People need to get off the hopium. If anything, there will be a NieR 3 that is as separate from it as Automata was from NieR 1.
        And that's exactly what I would want.
    It really doesn't need a sequel. Maybe other nier title yeah sure. But a sequel is really unnecessary imo
        I don't understand people who think Automata is getting a direct sequel. Like...what franchise are you playing? 

No, Ni3r is going to ask us what it means to truly be human on an alien world with Adam, Eve, and 9S as specters of the most tortured past.
            i dont think they mean automata 2 when they ask for a sequel
                The Replicant remaster may as well have been a new game considering how many people never played the original compared to Automata. And while it do well, its current sales aren't even close to 8M. I'd say an Automata 2 is what most people are looking for when they ask for a sequel. 
                    However, it should be no secret that Yoko really hates doing direct sequels so Automata 2 is what people want but that's probably not gonna happen
                Considering how little attention Replicant/Gestalt gets in comparison to Automata, I imagine that a lot of people are gonna be assblasted when the next game isn’t a direct sequel to Automata.
            That would be a cool idea...I keep hoping for the setting to be in the dark continent
            Bro. Yoko wrote NieR from a joke ending in drakengard. If he wanted or was asked to make a direct sequel to Automata, he easily could.
                Isn't that what the final fantasy DLC was supposed to be?
            The sexual to automata is Replicant 1.22( this isn't a joke) replicant 2011 is a different branch/loop.   That's the huge irony.

But realistically that was a LOT of set up and emphasis on the fight against legion in reincarnation. Like 3 of the characters are directly involved with it.
    I doubt we'll see no direct sequel on automata but you could always watch the anime for more context in some scenes in that...or catch the orchestra if they do another world tour again maybe.
Golden game gets what it deserves!
The only game I've bought twice.
    Ray Tracing Remaster !
Where's my sequel SE?

I need more 2B.
    Never cause their story is over
    We all need her
I’m all for a possible sequel starring a future descendant (android equivalent) of 9S and 2B in a World slowly rebuilding after the War. 

Although that probably would work better as a light novel than a game.

Edit: Or perhaps a story featuring A2 and 4S (if he survived).
Proper sequel please.


The project that Yoko is revealing this year better not be a mobile game.
But the picture says 800
    800万, which means 800 times ten thousand, so 8 million. Japanese doesn't have a counter for millions.
        That's so strange
I'm surprised it's only 8 million. P5 is already at 10 million, though you could argue it's due to rereleases. But Nier Automata had had rereleases too I believe.

I remember them going at it for GoTY and Iove both games.
    That 10 million for persona includes spin offs/sequels.
The number for just persona 5 and royal is 7.2 million.
    That includes base game, Royal, spinoffs etc so it doesn’t count
They really should remake Drakengard at this point 😂
Wonder if the anime part 2 will be able to get more game sales.

The mobile games part yes. I understand it brings in money. Konami is good at money as a main focus which makes sense need to get paid. But konamis past was great. Mgs is a landmark in good, story telling with commitment. Now they are remaking a game that should imo not be touched SH2 Is art as is (just my opinion, did not mean to sidetrack) now Konami makes tons off cheap thrills and gambling. I really really hope they don't do Yoko wrong as Konami did many employees as well as games. Chasing money instead of ones talent can be tempting but harmful to the medium. Sorry to type a lot. I keep having to say this i feel bad. Im a Japanese speaker and my English is not that great. I cant seem to be succinct (hope thats the word! Learned it today in English) and i type too many words. I hope Yoko has tons more experiences to share with us. And doesn't do what companies like the one i had mentioned Konami seeemed to do. I'm not sure if he's doing mobile for lot of $ or his true reasoning and dont wish to assume but I hope his creative, clearly understanding mind will push out more beautiful games and experiences.
It's a good idea to consider the Concert, Replicant 1.22, NA 1.1a and Reincarnation, the manga all one big multimedia project. It's clear they were all being produced with each other in mind.

And holy heck Reincarnation hits right.   Honestly it would not have worked thematically as any other type of game it kind of has to be a gatcha.

If your looking for some Taro try his trilogy Voice of Cards.  I'm rather enjoying it.
I want a game made of only music sequences like as in Drag-on Dragoons ending that leads to Nier ending E. And the very much frustrating yet beautiful ending to Drag-on Dragoon 3s music section. The OST in these games is amazing. Its music you can feel. Not a full priced game as it's not a complicated concept at face. Just a hang out, keep the rhythm and hear angelic beauty music playing with stunning visuals kinda game on the side would be neat.
Just the life of most nier fans :’)
I don't think it is hate to ourselves, but the realizations to our life and surroundings. I appreciate both Replicant and Automata a lot because I realized many things of humanity and humanism which made me to write this on my phone's wallpaper

Are you quoting Eva? Or are you asking a person who said something why they hate themselves?. Just curious I learned how to use the word projection or projecting recently in English this type of verbiage you used leans towards a project/projection. Inner feelings. A simple response otherwise would be no response. But if its a quote from Eva and how it had inspiration at a great level on Nier and even Drag-On Dragoon especially I respect this.
    It's not that deep, I was just being sarcastic. Us Nier/Yoko Taro fans love his games. The comment I replied to said they wanted to question their existence and be ripped to shreds. You can actually say I'm projecting though because I'm definitely in the same Fandom lol.

Card game?

        How the fuck did I not know this existed???
            It has angelic and some of the monster designs are strait from drakengard.   So let that simmer in your brain a bit
Does that include the ps3 sales or just the Royale alone?
    Just looked it up again and as of Dic last year is at 10 milion, but that is counting spinoff/sequel games which I think dont count, for just persona 5 and royal is 7.2 milion as of april 2023, so Automata is indeed in second place.
        Yea spinoffs definitely don't count. Whoever published that "count" you saw is dishonest as fuck xD
Console generations perhaps?
Ps4 era
It just occurred to me that [Palworld sold 2x](https://pcgamer.com/palworld-has-now-sold-a-staggering-19-million-copies-an-unstoppable-rise-that-means-its-got-a-bigger-population-than-the-netherlands) the lifetimes sales of Persona 5 in two weeks.

Like how the actual fuckedy fuck did that even happen? As far as JRPGs go, P5 is fairly mainstream. How does a random indie survival game outperform *years* of that in mere weeks.

I think it's time for me to lie down on the floor and contemplate the concept of reality.
    people like pokemon and botw, combine them and throw in some fun mechanics and sell it at an affordable price point and somehow you get a recipe for massive success

at first a lot of people got interested in palworld because it's "pokemon with guns" but then realised that it's actually a decent game lol

heavily inspired by a lot of games for sure, but still fun
    P5 is somewhat mainstream in the rpg community, but the rpg community is already its own niche within the wider gaming community. P5 is literally a niche within a niche though, with its anime aesthetics and turn-based gameplay
    Palworld was a flash in the pan that capitalized on people’s (not-unwarranted) dissatisfaction with the biggest multimedia IP of all time. The inherent absurdity and shock factor of the concept also meant that tons of content creators hopped on it the moment it dropped, creating a ton of word-of-mouth. It sold insanely quickly but also plummeted in sales shortly after.
        I bought it, I played it, Hella fun, for now I am done till they add more content( like a lot more, I know they added some new pals and stuff).
The P5 *series.* That is very different. It includes spinoffs. Read the article before you share it.
    Well I was aware of that lol. I just considered spinoff as sort of rereleases too, like DLCs.  Not sure why you're angry though. I do love both series
        Not angry, but pointing out misinformation.
Persona 5 Subseries, Persona 5 Royal and Vanilla are on 7,2 Million.
    And even further around doesn’t allow people to just upgrade over dlc, so I would imagine quite a few royal purchases are by people who double dipped.
Sadly Yoko has said many times after reincarnation that the nier series is done. You never know things could change but a true sequel I doubt we will see. Drakengard 3 was a prequel even though it was numbered 3. Thats just not how Yoko tells stories lol.
    I’m pretty sure he’s also said if there’s enough money thrown at him he’ll happily continue the nier series. He’s a funny guy
    I bet he is going to make a sequel, but to the ending where 2b eats a fish and fucking dies
        Some say that's the loop that divergent Battler is from
    Always said that with the asterix of "unless I get a lot of money for it". Whenever he had more serious interviews his answer has been that its very likely, but not very soon. As long as him, Okabe and Saito are alive they said they would make another one, just that they need some time to gather inspiration for it.
    I know he said that, but there's a lot of stuff he's said that hasn't been true to try to throw us off. If he goes through with it, then I don't mind the games ending how they did. But if he makes another, then I will be so happy.
    When did he say this? Because the most recent comment regarding Nier was by the producer saying that as long as Yoko was alive there will be more nier stuff.
        Theres hundreds of articles on it as soon as they completed nier reincarnation. He is a cheeky guy things may change but he has pushed forward many other projects over the last 3 years with no emphasis on nier.
            I feel like that would’ve been bigger news if he was actually being serious. Like I said, the bigger news was what yosuke saito the producer said. It would be a huge bag fumble on SE part to not invest in NieR now that people actually know and care about the franchise.
                Theres literally thousands of articles on it was huge news at the time. SE doesnt own enough of the right to produce Nier without Taro. Im not saying it couldn’t happen, but SE has been consolidating its IP’s not expanding.
                    I know he has said similar things, but all of those were basically jokes and Yoko just being a silly little guy. If it’s something he said years ago I don’t think it matters that much considering the saito comment happened like last year.
    No that was a joke man
    That was obviously a joke.  Nier series is not done.
And that's exactly what I would want.
I don't understand people who think Automata is getting a direct sequel. Like...what franchise are you playing? 

No, Ni3r is going to ask us what it means to truly be human on an alien world with Adam, Eve, and 9S as specters of the most tortured past.
    i dont think they mean automata 2 when they ask for a sequel
        The Replicant remaster may as well have been a new game considering how many people never played the original compared to Automata. And while it do well, its current sales aren't even close to 8M. I'd say an Automata 2 is what most people are looking for when they ask for a sequel. 
            However, it should be no secret that Yoko really hates doing direct sequels so Automata 2 is what people want but that's probably not gonna happen
        Considering how little attention Replicant/Gestalt gets in comparison to Automata, I imagine that a lot of people are gonna be assblasted when the next game isn’t a direct sequel to Automata.
    That would be a cool idea...I keep hoping for the setting to be in the dark continent
    Bro. Yoko wrote NieR from a joke ending in drakengard. If he wanted or was asked to make a direct sequel to Automata, he easily could.
        Isn't that what the final fantasy DLC was supposed to be?
    The sexual to automata is Replicant 1.22( this isn't a joke) replicant 2011 is a different branch/loop.   That's the huge irony.

But realistically that was a LOT of set up and emphasis on the fight against legion in reincarnation. Like 3 of the characters are directly involved with it.
That's so strange
