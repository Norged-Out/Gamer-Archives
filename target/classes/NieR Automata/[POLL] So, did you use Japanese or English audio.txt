[[[POLL] So, did you use Japanese or English audio]]





I like 9S a lot more in English, it's very expressive and natural. Just love the English dub.
    B-but..

*"Haaaaiiiiiii"*
        "Hai hai."

"One hai is enough."

"Haaaaaaii."
English because at the time of picking the audio I didn't feel long reading everything.
English was actually pretty good too!  
used english
Both. I chose Japanese in Route A, English in Route B, Japanese in Route C, and English during some stuff that I was doing with Chapter Select (unit data, side-quests, weapon upgrades, etc.)

I liked 9S's voice a bit more in English because Yuri Lowenthal does great with sarcastic care-free characters as well as characters that are either highly emotional or going insane (refer to Gideon in first Nier). However, I liked 2B's voice more in Japanese because her character was supposed to be highly restrained and "emotionless", yet the English voice gave her some sass and a slight bit of aggression. I liked A2's voice about equally in both languages. In English, there's some moments where she sounds a little too angsty, yet there are some moments where she delivers lines that give me Kaine flashbacks. Her Japanese voice is just good straight across. 

Overall, I prefer the Japanese voices because there really isn't any faults with them, and the lack of lip-synching with English voices is a little off-setting. 

 
    It's Kyle McCarley who does the English 9S, lol

            Are you reflecting on the meaning of existence robot?
I don't speak or understand Japanese so I choose English.
Finished the English Dub first. Second playthrough(after all the endings) in Japanese Dub. So far, I think 2B's voice is better in japanese, and 9S's voice is better in English, save for just a few moments.
I did English on my first run and am doing Japanese on my second.
9S voice is definitely better in English IMO. For the rest I liked both version, but 9S in English was spot on.
Japanese because I can understand enough of it spoken to go with it.
The English VO was brilliant in my opinion, and my love for it was strengthened by post-ending-B Nines. Probably some of the most emotional voice acting I've ever heard...
I normally choose the source language 100% of the time if it's an option because it's done how the creators intended it to be done. However, I tried English this time as I heard there was a lot of dialog/story stuff during combat where it would be really hard to look at subtitles (Subtitles during the bullet hell parts would be impossible). After finishing I'm glad I picked English for that exact reason because there is A LOT of important dialog happening during combat.



The dub was actually pretty good and the actors/actresses all did a good job conveying correct emotions and stuff (9S was really good, 2B was decent and A2 was also pretty good, Pascal was good as well). I may pick Japanese when I decide to play the game a second time just to get the original emotions since it wont matter too much if I miss some things because I already know them.
As soon as i noticed Yui Ichikawa voice acting 2B i couldn't change anymore. I loved her voice acting as Mikasa in AoT.
