[[FINAL FANTASY XVI “AMBITION” Trailer]]





They anticipate an M for Mature rating? Is that a first for the Final Fantasy franchise?
    For a mainline FF game, yes.

For Final Fantasy as a whole, Final Fantasy Type 0 was rated M.
        Whoa..you're right. I wonder if it's the introductory scenes with the war that escalated it to M, because I can't think of anything else in the game that would make it an M.
            To quote the ESRB:

> This is an action game in which players assume the role of students fighting to protect their nation from invaders. Players traverse fantasy environments and battle enemy soldiers and other creatures in melee-style combat. Players use swords, bows, firearms, and magic spells to kill various enemies (e.g., robots, blobs, mechanical beasts). Battles are accompanied by realistic gunfire, screams of pain, and large blood-splatter effects; some sequences depict blood stains on players' screen and corpses lying in pools of blood. Cutscenes depict additional acts of violence: a man stabbing himself with a sword; a girl shot by a sniper; a character shot close-up. During the course of the game, some female characters are depicted in outfits that expose large amounts of cleavage and jiggling breasts. In one sequence, players can use a spy camera to zoom in on a female character wearing a bikini. The game includes event scenes in which a character sedates/drugs players' character and performs unknown acts on them; it is implied that some of these acts may be of a sexual nature.
                If you told me this description was for Fire Emblem, I wouldn't question it.
                    Doesn't get that much breast and cleavage in Fire Emblem Three Houses
                        Nah, but Heroes more than makes up for it
                Aiit I'm preordering this game now. 😭 These ratings just sold me.
                    I'm pretty sure that's for Final Fantasy Type-0, not FFXVI
            In Type—0 at the end of each battle you steal your enemies souls as they’re vaporized into a cloud of red mist… the game has a lot of scenes that are pretty violent and bloody.
            [removed]
                They're talking about Type-0 I'm pretty sure
                    Yep!
        Why wasn't Stranger of Paradise R? It was a big boy adult game >:(
            It WAS M rated though... Also had the first FF f-bomb
                also had the first FF Limp Bizkit-bomb
                That was an awesome scene, too.

People can say what they want about that game.  It knows what it's about.
                    It was about stopping chaos?
            Rated C for CHAOS!!
        Stranger of Paradise too
    Yoshi P. finally got the M rating he's wanted 14 to have
        Wait, the game where one of the antagonist's backstory is that she was sold into sexual slavery by her parents is only rated T?
            Theres a LOT of dark themes in 14, that i am surprised that still T, i cant imagine what more stuff Yoshi P and team will created if the game was rated M.
                Endwalker has two scenes in a particular zone that I still can't believe are in a T rated game.
                    Yeah, >!dunno how they got away with some dude putting a gun in his mouth and pulling the trigger with a T rating tbh.!<
                        Yoshi-P's team has mastered the art of "implying but not showing" in FFXIV. You never actually seen the guy put the gun in his mouth, but the audience could put two and a two together within the context.
                        A guy shot himself on-screen in Insomniac's Spider-Man and that got a T.
                They said they wanted *that* scene in Shadowbringers to not happen while obscured but couldn't because of the T rating
                    Which scene was this?
                        Poor Tesleen.
            The keyword here is implication
As long as they don't say that's what happened all's good

But a wink wink nudge nudge doesn't hurt
Still very little actual gameplay shown, but I cannot deny this game looks and sounds incredible. The music is excellent (I don't think any FF score has ever been bad), the voice acting sounds pretty good, and of course the cutscenes they showed looked incredible.

Looking forward to seeing more gameplay as they ramp up to release.
    Just about everything looks like its in-engine at the least, and it's come leaps and bounds since that first reveal trailer. 

The Eikon battles look extremely unique so there must have been some insane work put into this game. Everything looks bespoke and not copy-pasted.
        What's interesting about the game engine that *Final Fantasy XVI* uses is that there have yet to been any confirmations or announcements what engine it is; among speculated has been the Luminous Engine, Unreal Engine, an extension of FFXIV's engine (Itself once been an amalgamation of both Luminous and Crystal Tools.) e.t.c. It wasn't until last month that a user at the /r/FFXVI-subreddit managed to [scour a technical presentation Square made back in 2018](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFXVI/comments/x2ro5c/which_engine_would_ffxvi_use_crystal_tools_or/imlavqh/?context=3) of what was at the time a secret project, but which showcased models that were later to be shown in the FFXVI-trailers of Sanbreque's knights, and where FFXVI's director, Hiroshi Takai, served as model demonstrating of this new engine's features. Summarized was that this secret project at the time explored initially features with the Unreal Engine 4, but which the development staff found the results unsatisfactorily to their goals, to which an extension of the FFXIV-engine was utilized, as well as full time-programmers being hired solely to further develop on this engine. This times well with how later in [2020, studio CBU:III was in recruitment of further staff (Lighting director for instance.) for FFXVI, while also announcing their base production and scenario complete, while further developing of their toolsets](https://www.gematsu.com/2020/10/final-fantasy-xvi-basic-development-and-scenario-production-already-complete).

The engine-speculation was further stoked by how Square Enix last month made [trade-marking for what they called the *Radec Engine*](https://www.gematsu.com/2022/09/square-enix-trademarks-radec-engine-in-japan), which we have no information other than the name itself of what it entails of. So far, Square currently mainly utilizes Unity, Unreal Engine, Luminous Engine and FFXIV's engine for their games, so question remains what this *Radec Engine* is to be, and if FFXVI is the first entry of it.
            Interesting. Square Enix invested a lot in the Luminous engine, and it was surprising to see FF7R use Unreal instead of their own, presumably very costly, engine.

Luminous definitely still has the potential to bring consoles and PC's to their knees, and FFXV still looks great. I thought SE has given up on their engine but perhaps there's more life in it with FFXVI
                They're using Luminous for Forspoken. Looks basically exactly like 15
    Have you played FF14 at all? The composer for most of the tracks in that game is doing this one, so if you liked this trailer you can find literally dozens of hours of music he’s done over the last decade for 14. Soken is awesome.
        I have not, I spent 6 years playing WoW so I'm sworn off all MMOs going forward lol. 

I do have a few friends who have played/still play FF14 and they always speak highly of the OST, so I knew Soken most likely would deliver.
            If it helps FFXIV is designed around *not* keeping you addicted. The devs literally said they want players to just play for a bit every new patch, then return back to other games. There's no daily logins, they dont remove content and its designed so old content is always active, and they're even adding the ability to just play through the main story with an NPC party over other players. You can basically just play through it as a singleplayer game by design.
                Came to say this! I signed up summer of 2020 so I could mentally survive the pandemic and its been one of my best gaming choices ever. No pressure.
                    Me and my friends joined just before the pandemic kicked off and its been a wild ride. I already enjoyed the game but once I reached shadowbringers it became an all-time classic rivalling the rose-tinted glasses of the other games. Endwalker launch was a special time for me too, theres a great feeling of community running along the main quests with all the other players, and its great just being able to pop on a few times a year to catch up on content rather than feeling obligated to be on every single day.
                        Endwalker was my first time being truly caught up to MSQ. There's a certain *je ne sais quo* about going through an area and seeing two dozen people in the same innocuous spot, all watching a cutscene.

I sped through the entire expansion in a week, and to this day I still think >!Ultima Thule is one of the most beautifully haunting area in the game, if not in games period.!<
                            That last walk was one of the heaviest things I’ve seen from a game.
                [deleted]
                    there is a free trial you can play the base game and first expansion up to level 60. I hear it's critically acclaimed....
                        Specifically speaking the trial takes you through one of the best story arcs in the game with the Heavansward expansion, it will give you a really good idea if the game is something you want to continue
                    It does
                    > Does it still require a monthly subscription?

The game has multiple expansions

A Realm Reborn > Heavensward > Stormblood > Shadowbringers > Endwalker.

You get to play ARR and HW for free, which should last you about 200 hours. ARR is a bit slow, but HW has a great story.
                        Another note is that if you buy Endwalker you get all the previous expansions with it. Only ever need to buy the latest expac, and you get all of them.
                            But if you buy the game keep in mind that you can't access the trial anymore. So you should play until lvl 60 and finish heavensword and then buy the game
                It'll just take half a year of casual play to catch up.
                    Nothing to really "catch up" with if your main draw is the campagin. Just go at it at your own pace and enjoy one of the best rides in video games.
                        Yeah been playing it at a pretty slow pace for over a year and am at Endwalker, been an incredible experience and I'm really glad I haven't rushed myself.
                        Sure but when you have friends talk you into it like most of the time when you get into an MMO and everyone's excited about this new expansion coming or that new patch and then it's like cool but in a year and a half you can be there.
                    The thing is, unlike WoW, the "real game" game isn't at the end. The game is the journey as well as the destination. It's amazing.


You can even join a guild (Free Company) and they can *join you* in the biggest moments, their levels getting synced down without making the content completely trivial for people who haven't seen it a million times. It's just a really fun game that goes on and on and on. ...Once you get through most of ARR. Ooph.
                        I agree the story experience is breathtaking, but even then the actual gameplay during questing is somehow even less engaging than leveling usually is, and I could not stand how on one hand the game was constantly making me disband my party to do certain quests but then on the other hand would make me join other big parties to do others, and some of those big group quests would be brain dead dungeons or they'd be challenging raids that you actually needed to study up on to get past. It's like I had to both care and not care more than I wanted to the whole time.

But again when you really were into the story it's like you could've dropped all the gameplay and just traveled from story beat to story beat. Whatever quests had you actually do felt like afterthoughts.
                            Oh 100%. One of the things I miss from WoW is how clever and variable the quests got over time. Still simple stuff, but different.


14 has some neat stuff but it comes later on in the form of solo duties, and those and few and far between. Many agree basically solo boss fights. There was one brilliant and memorable one in Endwalker, though.
                            I think the core problem is the first 2 expansions, despite their attempts to fix them (it’s been over a year for me, maybe 2?) are a real slog story wise IMO.

So unless you can skip through it but still get the story to lead into the other stuff it’s a big ask for a casual player. But they’re doing something right so my archmchair analysis is worth less than a grain of salt.
                    > It'll just take half a year of casual play to catch up.

Way more. The main campaign that gets you to max level alone is what, 600 hours long?

I no lifed it last year, from ARR to the end of Endwalker, and it took me 2 months to finish it.

But the MSQ is the game's strongest point by far so that's fine. It's a fantastic story.
                        It really is.
                when is that npc update out you think?
                > You can basically just play through it as a singleplayer game by design.

That's because it is a single player game at its core. 

After reaching EndWalker, I can say this game feels like a 300 hours cinematic where you occasionally kill mobs and rarely group with other players.
                > There's no daily logins

Are you sure you played the game? There's both daily and weekly grinds, golden saucer, and a bunch of other random stuff with daily/weekly caps.
                    Oh, there’s always something you can spend your time on, but none of it is mandatory. You can always get caught up in short order if you step away for a time.
                        Same is true for WoW as well. Return at the start of a new patch and you have a bunch of catchup mechanics.
            I'm a 14 year WoW refugee. Zero regrets. No addiction (except the "addiction" of wanting to play any games you look forward to), but I don't feel like I'm missing out if I don't play for a week.
                The problem with FF14 with me is that the game require a monthly sub, and I would feel guilty if I only play 2-4 hours a week. Hence I swore it off instead of trying to play for the sake of playing.

That is why I like GW2 better...I can quit for six years and still be ready to go through end game content cause GW2 gears don't become obsolete.
                    I usually just put FF14 off for a few months and come back when there’s a few major patches of content to get through. I don’t really see it as an MMO you keep coming back to every day. At least unless you really love the world and get sucked into every side activity. 

Even the endgame’s progression is very short once you’re there, so it doesn’t feel like you need to stay subscribed for months.
                    Sure--that makes total sense to me.

I've also been a Final Fantasy fan since the original in the 80s, though, so 14 was an easy and nostalgic sell for me when I transitioned.
            I feel like we’ll all be in for a treat with 16 because Soken really hasn’t missed in 14.
            Here is Soken. Bow before his majesty. https://youtu.be/shWBppGY5G4
            I mean, if u like singleplayer rpgs then ff14 is a great choice. the mmo stuff is optional. Its just another final fantasy game with some multiplayer elements. They are even making it so that you can do the whole story without interacting with other players.
        Do you know... la hee? 

Man I love Soken. I can't think of a single track I would mute (other than the Gold Saucer music, but I feel like that's their way of discouraging you from staying in the casino too long!)
            I turn off the battle music, just gets in the way of the nice area themes. Especially the night ones.
        [Are we acting like FF 15 didn't have an amazing OST either?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkKVUswNxX8)
            No. I was pointing out that since the person above me liked the music in the trailer they might want to check out the music in 14 because that’s the same composer.
            "I really like coke!"

"Wow I can't believe you're hating Pepsi like that"
        Do you know.... Lahi?
    Still waiting for any gameplay besides combat 3 trailers in. So far it seems to be cutscenes -> combat in an arena-> cutscenes -> combat in an arena -> repeat. It could certainly still be a good game even with just that but I hope there is more to it.
        It's been discribed as a roller coaster of action by the producer so it might be cutscene > small gameplay segment fighting mooks > Eikon fight loop, which to be fair when your character can channel the power of gods at will it's hard to find regular people that would be a challenge. 

We also haven't seen much signs of monsters.
            There were a Morbol and a Coeurl in the initial reveal trailer, at the very least.
    FF ost and music were never the weakness part of the franchise. It has been consistent
    >Still very little actual gameplay shown

The very few snippets like that dodge counter against Titan have me hopeful though.
    I'm hoping that they're holding off on showing gameplay because they're looking to sizzle hype for a while longer before collapsing the epic event of The New Final Fantasy into... just a video game. However, the more cynical side of me says that they're still not happy with how the combat feels and are trying to fine-tune it further before showing us more than disconnected fragments. Given that it's still over half a year from launch (and maybe close to a full year) that's not a *terrible* sign even if it is the case. They've still got plenty of time for tweaks. But if it's not there yet months after the game is supposedly "basically done," or if the *performance* isn't there yet which is another strong possibility, then they may have some real trouble closing it out no matter how much time they've got.

Oh well. Hope it's just marketing. At the very least this trailer showed some very solid voice acting, and that Dominants can Devil Trigger for more manageable boss fights instead of always being the size of a building.
        The reason why they don't show gameplay that much is because YoshiP is known to be such a stickler when it comes to trailers. In fact, if it was up to him, he wouldn't even release trailers now. He would release it like 6 months before release. He really hates spoiling things early. Only reason we are getting trailers is because he's being forced to.

They already mentioned that the game is at the final touches. Whatever gameplay you think they are hiding because they are not satisfied, is already done. They have been doing QA for the last year now as they mentioned in a past producer letter.
            okay but I don't. Really believe that. I don't think that this game is going unreleased through a year and a half of QA without there being any significant parts of it they're unsatisfied with. Performance issues are currently my frontrunner and would be a very strong reason for not showing off anything besides cutscenes \~9 months out from release. I am aware of what Yoshi P prefers but a comprehensible 15 straight seconds of what the game actually looks like to play or any of the things you do in it besides Hit A Guy is not spoilers. It's not necessary for FFXIV trailers because everyone already knows how that game plays because it's been out for almost a decade.
                It's spoilers for him because he already said there will be characters who will be with the MC when he goes to different places. So what does that mean? If he shows a trailer with the protagonist with other people that makes it already a spoiler because people will have an idea what will happen on when and where.

That's enough of a spoiler for him.

Also I think you should know that the game was supposed to release this year but SE moved it back just for Forspoken.
    There's always something a little uncanny valley-ish about FF games to me.
        Yeah, I feel like the character models look like a human version of an anime character. There's like an extra layer of translation between what actual people look like since it's going human>anime>model instead of just human>model.
            It feels almost Gamecubey to me? But obviously extremely modern and polished.

I think it's the lack of shadows/depth in character models that makes it feel almost like 3d modern characters but on a flat plane. I get the same thing with From Soft games though.
                Could it also be that their irises don't move completely like humans? If you look at [Cindy](https://youtu.be/8PMDFu9d83Y?t=446) in FFV15,  she has the big eye movements to change what she's looking at but not the little flicks (saccades) that actual people do. Compare for example [Kingsglaive](https://youtu.be/UblcNFVVHT8?t=51), and the fact that the pre-rendered cutscenes in FFXV do have them.

Their movements are also a little stiff outside of fighting, anytime they walk, run or gesture it's somewhat exaggerated. Although that might be intentional so it adds to the feeling of dynamism. 

Also the fact that their faces don't deform that much when they move. Compare [Ellie's facial expressions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-iZiuT0zPU) in The Last of Us Part II even in the still-posed Model Viewer, she has cheek creases and brow creases and her hair moves realistically.  

Actually compare Noctis and >!Sid!< from FFXV [in the same scene alone](https://youtu.be/8PMDFu9d83Y?t=467). >!Sid!<'s irises still don't move, but >!his!< whole face is full of wrinkles and creases that are moving and giving a lot of detail. In comparison, Noctis only moves his eyes, cheeks and lips a little, and no wrinkles in sight. Even more true for their hands, arms, tight-fitting clothing, etc..

(No shade by the way, just observations.)
        Because FF characters are really really really good looking.
    Yeah I hope it doesn't turn out to be another Forspoken.
    I was worried that they'd use the same kind of dialogue as FFXIV but it seems they've improved the awkward pacing issues and dropped the extreme Olde English accent, which is great to see.

Definitely need a gameplay showcase for sure.
        The elimination of said pacing issues could be due to FFXVI will be the first *Final Fantasy*-title to utilize English as its original language, along with how it was [confirmed last year that the voice actors will also be doing motion-capture for the game](https://www.siliconera.com/final-fantasy-xvi-will-feature-full-facial-mocap-using-english-voice-actors/). So the voice actors aren't just voicing, but seems to also be delivering their lines in a real-time fashion similar to how *Resident Evil VIII*, *Guardians of the Galaxy* and most other major cinematic games does their performances.
            Just as god intended
            > FFXVI will be the first Final Fantasy-title to utilize English as its original language

I didn't know that! That actually explains why the English voice acting is so good! I speak Japanese and always prefer Japanese for anime/games, but FF16 is the first time I've felt the English VA is better.

When the first trailer came out I was shocked by how good the English voice acting and lines were. I was even telling my friend they were so good that I felt like the lines had been written in English first then translated to Japanese afterwards, rather than the other way round that it is for every other game. I'm actually impressed with myself that I was able to tell lol
        Only one single character in XIV talks with the "extreme olde english" because he's a nerd who grew up spending more time with books than with others.
            Yeah, especially later on in the story Urianger is a a joy. They turned "generic scholar who speaks fancy" into "bookworm nerd who spends so much time studying old tomes that he cant speak properly, so everybody gives out and makes fun of him for it". One of my favourite characters.
                I'm glad they doubled down on him and Y'stola.  They're two if the better written characters in FF history.  They both start out generic, but you really get to know them as time goes on.  And tbh, they don't really change that much, you just understand why they're the way they are, which is amazing writing.  Less Flanderization, more depth.
                    It's hard to single out most of the main party but I'd probably throw Thancred in there too. Starts off as the "cool playboy" type and really gets some fantastic depth by the end of Shadowbringers.
                        Special mention to Alphinaud throughout Heavensward. He was ablittle shit in A Realm Reborn, but he grew into a far more likeable person by the end. His growth as he became more humble was well done.
                            Hell Alisaie too. She went from being stuffed into a highly optional raid series to being her own character who stands apart from her brother.
                                Oh yes, getting to spend more time with her was one of the best parts of Stormblood.

But Alisale wasnt ablittle shit like her twin lol
                                    It was honestly the highlight for me. I love both the twins now, they really balance each other out. It was great finally getting to know her. They're really playing the long-form format well, having minor characters reappear from years ago to become lead roles, >!and also having leading characters retire to side ones as they do their own things!< really makes the world feel alive and natural. Its the same reason One Piece feels like such a grand adventure.
                        From Playboy Thancred to Depressed Dadcred
                        The stuff with him and Ryne is so so fucking good. Maybe my absolute favorite moment in ShB is the scene with him in the graveyard though.
                Absolutely in my top 3 as well. Pretty well every scene he's in during later expansions is impeccably written and acted.
        FF14 has really good voice acting, but the flow can feel stilted because it (usually) allows you to pause between line deliveries due to it being an MMO and needing to give people a chance to step away from the keyboard.


The only character who routinely talks in olde English is Urianger, and it’s done as half comic relief and to heighten certain monologues.
            I think the reason why Urianger speaks in old English is because in the Japanese version he speaks very formally. To localize it, the team decided to make him speak in Shakespearean like English and it added charm to Urianger.
                [deleted]
                    Dragon Quest does this, it actually tends to work pretty well.
                    I know Xenoblade 2 used accents to highlight where a character came from. The Blades typically had an American accent (from metropolitan to valley girl to high school venacular), people from the more agriculturally focused Gormott had Welsh accents, or the people from Mor Ardain had Scottish accents. This feature sort of carried on in Xenoblade 3 (since it follows XC1 and 2).
                    Final Fantasy IX had a great localisation IMO which used different accents etc (although obviously it's not voiced).
                Also back in 1.0 he has a pretty wild storyline that the olde English played into. Urianger recognized the obscure prophecy van Darnus was using as a road map for Project Meteor... so he traveled around reciting those exact prophecies to distract van Darnus so he(?)° didn't notice the Circle of Knowing working on stopping Project Meteor. It worked great, and it's a pity there are no callbacks to this in Garlean related content later on.

°English localization screwed up here, long story short in Japanese Nael was female from the start but her gender was never explicitly mentioned; you can do that in Japanese without it being suspicious like avoiding all gender references would be in English. Localizers assumed the enemy commander was male. That's why the dialogue in Coils is so bizarre; the localizers skip the *obvious* Samus reveal explanation for "him" being a woman and go for Bahamut changing Nael's gender for... reasons. This was later retconned further to a female relative stepping into the original Nael's armor after his death.

            Thanks for your reply, really interesting info! I did play XIV from about 1.16 all the way through to Stormblood but I didn't know a lot of this background info about the team.
    I'd like to highlight the voice acting, since I'm quite a snob when it comes to VA. I speak Japanese and prefer Japanese dub over English 100% of the time; I cringe super hard at most English dubs. FF7R's English dubs are absolutely terrible to me for instance. But the English dub is extremely well done in FF16 based on the trailers.

Edit: After watching this trailer in both languages I think the English VA's have outdone the Japanese ones, and I've NEVER thought that about any anime/game before. If I want to be super nitpicky I think the Japanese version of the "It is *you* who will bow to *me*" line was executed better but the rest of the English VA is airtight.
        ha that's funny. I ended up really liking the English dub for FF7R. They all really grew on me, especially Barrett, Aerith, and Tifa.
        It's probably because of Koji Fox doing the localization. Most localization leads aren't as high up the chain as Koji is in Business Division 3 so he's afforded a bit more.
        I feel the same, the Japanese VA actually sounds a bit off somehow.
            Apparently the dialogue was written in English originally, so the Japanese VAs are using translated lines. They sound "off" for the same reason every English dub of anime sounds off, it's at least partially due to the translations. It all makes sense to me now lol
                16 is done by the same team as 14, and 14's localization is an interesting one. That one is done in Japanese first, but the English localization is so well-done that even a good chunk of Japanese players prefer it to the original Japanese. 14's JP script isn't bad, but it's kind of generic fantasy in some places; it's really more of a testament to just how beloved the EN localization is.

So now with 16, I believe it was reported that they did all the English voice work *first* and then translated it back into Japanese, with 14's much-beloved head of localization Michael-Christopher "Koji" Fox being the Localization Director for 16 as well.
That soundtrack's sounding goooood. To be honest, I'm not really sure what we're looking forward to next year, I feel like maybe I've fallen out of touch a little with the interesting games on the horizon, but I've never lost sight of this one, it's got my attention pretty wholeheartedly.

Hopefully we get a slice of gameplay soon, because they've given us some good story and dramatic eikon battle teases, but the snippets of regular gameplay have been brief and difficult to infer much from.
    Masayoshi mothafuckin Soken. This guy is a freaking genius. I really can't wait to hear what else he has in store for us when the game finally releases, cause for sure there are going to be some banger tracks.

[I mean just listen to this masterpiece!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tyuIh12_HU)

As for the gameplay, judging from the very few glimpses of combat we've seen I have faith in CBU3 in giving us a solid system.
        Why wouldn't you post his actual [masterpiece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6dTkAmpfI)?
            When you know which clip they're referring to before even clicking on the link...
            Do you know LA HEE? I sure do.
            I'm going to need some context here. That was....something else.
                Soken usually does a goofy performance during Fan Fests.

In 2016 he [played](https://youtu.be/KwKUnJ2yO7s) a dungeon theme using two instruments and then just kicking a cardboard box.
                FFXIV's third expansion, Shadowbringers, has a day time track called "Civilizations" for one of its six zones. Pretty much from day one when the expansion released the "LA HEE" got memed hard and still does to this day. The FFXIV team does fanfests every two years (usually used as a staging grounds to tease and announce the next expansion) where they do loads of stuff for and with the playerbase.

The clip you're confused about is from the fanfest 2021, which would have normally been three separate ones spread over the late fall 2020 to early spring 2021 in Japan, the US and Europe but due to the pandemic they streamed it. One of the sections was about several of the ingame tracks of the game, either played on piano, by the game's own band (THE PRIMALS) or by the man, Masayoshi Soken, himself like the video linked above. Basically a giant love letter to the community, showing that pretty much every part of the development team is in tune with the community.

At another part of the fanfest, the team did another homage to a meme where [members of the dev team danced to the live version of the "A Long Fall" track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6tEi-6BLsw) that plays [during one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NApxz5bSl20) of the [Shadowbringers dungeons.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9QD25nakt8) The different colors of the shirts stand for tank (blue), healer (green) and DPS (red) - representing a dungeon group.
                This is from the fan festival in 2021, where the devs put on a convention to celebrate the game. There's often a bunch of announcements, events, and as you see here, a concert. 2021 was fully remote due to COVID.

The singer, Soken, is the main composer of FFXIV and is very highly regarded. This was one of the songs in the concert, which was a cover of a [overworld theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ascfjJXDWjo). One of the lyrics in the theme is La Hee, which has become a meme in the FF community. 

So basically, this legend walks on stage with no preamble, goes "Do you know La Hee?" and starts to sing... that. It was hilarious.
                To add on to the rest of the context: 

Soken's always had a silly side where he's not afraid to go on stage and act the fool to put on some truly memorable performances, but this particular FanFest (where the above took place) he announced that he'd spent much of the pandemic secretly working from the hospital where he was being treated for cancer. He only told as many people as he had to in order to make the working arrangement possible and asked that they keep it secret from the rest of the development team, so that he could work as "normally" as possible. 

He went on to say that his cancer is completely in remission and that the thought of the fans enjoying his work got him through the experience. So in addition to his general silliness, I think there's a hefty dose of "I'm still alive to be able to do this!" thrown in there as well.
                It's Civilizations from the [Rak'Tika Greatwood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ascfjJXDWjo) zone in FFXIV, Soken wanted to perform it himself as he originally intended it.
        Shimamura and Hamauzu were good too but Soken really is the closest thing we've had to a replacement for Uematsu. Just incredible.
            The dude's range is absolutely bonkers. From bangers like [Under the Weight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WR1-pds8qM) to "this should be in every music to relax to playlist" like [Sultana Dreaming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG-BIMPtC9k) (Uldah Night Theme).
                I was fortunate enough to play FFXIV for many hours with a good friend.

Later, during a particularly difficult part of my life I rediscovered Sultana Dreaming, I absolutely broke down sobbing, it felt like home. Like being safe around good friends with peace in your heart.

Whenever I listen to it to this day I still am comforted in a way that is difficult to describe.
                or when he remixes an old song and does.. [amazing things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsX6nxwCZ1o)
            I'm gonna say it. For me, he's surpassed Uematsu. I'm more of a rock music kinda guy, so Soken starting from that as his square one means his tracks often just hit the tone better for me.
    > but the snippets of regular gameplay have been brief and difficult to infer much from.

Agreed, but the regular combat did look pretty cool in that snippet.

And the combat controls actually looked more similar to FFXV than FFV7R to me, with magic that we have to wait to recharge after each use instead of just using MP.
Regardless of how this game turns out, the OST is already looking to be like another spectacular entry. Praise be Soken
    XV had such an amazing ost
        Yoko Shimomura is fantastic
        Hellfire, Somnus Ultima, Wanderlust, Apocalypsis Noctis and its variants, Ignis main theme. Absolutely epic and amazing soundtracks
            No Valse di Fantastica?
                I was just listing off the top of my head!
    Soken stop making making bangers challenge (impossible)
        IDK how he keeps releasing a new banger every single patch of FFXIV. Man is a machine
            Well that's because he's no longer the sole composer of the game and others joined over the time as well. Soken is fantastic, but other composers like Daiki Ishikawa and Takafumi Imamura deserves as much credit as Soken, too
                (Some minor spoilers for Endwalker below via song titles)

For those unaware, Ishikawa and Imamura were responsible for (or heavily involved in) creating such songs as: The Black Wolf Stalks Again, Your Answer, the Sharlayan daytime theme, the Ktisis Hyperborea theme, and the Endwalker dungeon boss theme, and several of the dynamis themes.

Soken probably still deserves the lion's share of credit for building FFXIV's musical identity, but his team are fantastic composers and arrangers in their own right.
                    The remixes in Endwalker of other expansion songs were great at repurposing the vibes of the original songs with adding new character to them.  Really well done by those composers and the team.
            ff14 wasn't for me but that soundtrack is killer
            the two horsemen of bangers every patch: soken and yu peng chen

we need to find two more consistent sources of every patch a banger so we have the four horsemen though
    Every Final Fantasy is a divisive one, but there's one thing each Final Fantasy fan agrees on - soundtrack is always masterpiece
        Yeah, even generally considered "not that great" entries like [15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xkv3HbHBdBI) and [13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKR5lSKeZxk) have amazing soundtracks
    The music from all three trailers (but especially the second one) has just been epic. Soken is fantastic.
Damn this is looking better and better. Please be good, Final Fantasy XV really wore me out man please Final Fantasy XVI don't let me down.
    With Yoshi P at the helm, the Heavensward writing team, the Dragons Dogma/DMC5 Combat Director and Soken doing the music, I'm much more confident that it will be great.
        >With Yoshi P at the helm

Well Yoshida *isn't* at the helm, the director is Hiroshi Takai, whose probably most well known for [The Last Remnant...](https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/the-last-remnant)
            that's great to hear. The Last Remnant was probably the only singleplayer RPG they made where you felt like exploring an actual world with good fantasy elements and having an actual team at your side in the entire PS3 era of Square Enix
                The Last Remnant was a middling game that was severely weighed down by its confusing explanation (or lack thereof) regarding the combat and party systems that was perhaps a little *too* RNG and automated, because in the end you're only influencing the battle.

However, it's really unfortunate that people almost never give the world, races, art and music of The Last Remnant the time of day because of how under the radar it is. It's full of concepts that are so cool and a lot of them are executed very well... it's just actually playing the game where half of the time I'm scratching my head or beating it against a brick wall. I agree with you, and I am excited for FFXVI, but still..

Further pissed off that the Remastered version of the game looks graphically far superior and is a great remaster, but is locked to console at max 1080p (because it came out before PS4 Pro) with no patch, and they REMOVED the prexisting PC version from all digital storefronts with no announcement or hint whatsoever that we'll get a port of the remaster.
                    I’ve had this game in my steam library for ages. Is this some kind underperforming inferior version? I know nothing about it other than buying it ages ago.
                        The PC version is perfectly fine, it runs very well and works right out of the box with controllers too (you may have to switch to controller control setting and max the graphics first). Funnily enough, it was considered probably the only good JRPG port on PC for years upon years despite the game itself not being hot.

The remastered version on console moves it to Unreal Engine 4 and honestly it's very impressive how much of UE4 they shoved into it without it looking like a rush job. And it also adds a super-sprint mode that lets you run in the overworld sections MUCH faster... that's it.
                    The PC port doesn't really run at 4k either so you're not missing anything. I have both, the console versions have better lighting while the pc version has better framerates.
                Game was terrible, but had a cool world and ideas that were executed poorly.
            The Last Remnant was great, though
            Oh shit I loved last remnant. Nice
        Damn, talk about an all-star team. I had no idea.
            SQEX is pulling out all the stops by bringing out their Aces.
                They probably have to, in order to restore faith in the series after how FFXV was (understandably) received.
                    I liked FFXV!

Bad Final Fantasy game but great camping with your buddies simulator.
                        Ffxv is a interesting “failure”. For like every part it does well there’s 3 parts that are poorly developed.

But I think it’s the best FF game to establish the party as a real group. As opposed to a band of characters joining together for a common goal. Like they really were friends and it was obvious.

The campfire scene in the end of the game I think is a payoff worthy of getting through some of the slog that is the game.

Great world, lore, just poorly connected and told. I would love for them to redo it one day the way properly.
                        I really like it too but they pretty blatantly gave up on the game/world halfway through their DLC plans. I think we ultimately got 4/7 character DLCs and one ok MP DLC. There's quite a bit of that story they deliberately left out.
                        FFXV flirting with magical realism for its world is infinitely more interesting to me than the drab fantasy world for FFXVI.  I don't fault anyone for liking it though and wanting a return to that type of setting given it's integral to the series' history.
                    > after how FFXV was (understandably) received.

And FF13, and FF13-2, and FF13-3, and to some extent FF12.   
They really need to restore people faith in mainline non MMO Final Fantasy games.
                And keeping Nomura well the fuck away.

That gives me hope.
                    Some of you act like Nomura killed your families.
                        In another timeline he might have!!
                            He kills your family in a random card battler side game off the main series
                                that ends up being pivotal to the plot for the next decade
                            I bet it was actually his nobody Romnuxa traveling between worldlines with the power of waking. Easy mistake to make
                            Underrated comment. Next thing you know, Donald and Goofy will show up!
                        My family died in the pouch and zipper wars so he did.
                        Nomura didn't kill my family, he just won't leave my damn house.
                    >Game has nothing to do with Nomura, he's not even remotely involved

reddit: GRRR NOMURA
                        Nomura is writing the last 2 books of ASOIF? The delayed release makes so much sense now...
                    Nomura has had some kind of creative input in nearly every single good thing that Square Enix has ever created.

Why the hate?
                        Nomura to me is like Zack Snyder, dude is really good at what made his name (Nomura a character designer, Snyder was a director of photography) but when they started to get director roles, that's when it got meh.

I think that the first 2 KH games are good, but that's it. Everything else that he was involved as a director is sub par, but when he gets to just design things, he does a good job.
                            kingdom hearts is really the only series he's directed, sans the f7 remake, but he wasn't responsible for the unpopular changes to its narrative despite people thinking it. even seems like most don't realize how much he contributed to the original

his work as producer/concept creator also extends to twewy and stranger of paradise, both of which are good!
                                TWEWY’s design is top notch
                            I don’t even think he’s a bad director per se, but he reminds me a bit of George Lucas where he needs someone to keep his ideas in check. I love KH1 and 2, along with the VII remake, and he’s not the primary writer on any of those. He’s got a good eye for visual flair, generally fun gameplay decisions and can come up with some interesting plot points, but he needs a good writer and producer to reign him in or it just goes off the rails and becomes too much.
        I already knew about those things, but I still get that certain Vince McMahon gif-like reading that every time lol. 

I mean, YoshiP and his team at FFXIV are literally the last bastion of FF-sanity over there at Square-Enix. That alone gets me interested in FFXVI.
            I wouldn't completely count out the FFVIIR team. Regardless of the story direction, there is a lot of good things with the remakes in terms of presentation, graphics, characters and gameplay.
                Oh I absolutely love how they handled combat and materia progression in that. Like Character swapping alone in general. After YEARS of struggling from Square Enix to get a mix of traditional FF and action combat right. All I could think was how some other action-JRPGS would have totally benefited from that concept alone (*freaking Xenoblade Chronicles!!!).*

But to it's degree, it's a Remake of something that came before and not something new and unique at the time. FFXIII, and especially FFXV could have been treated a hell of a lot better. So unfortunately it had to be a Remake to get people back on Square's Side...or it was fantastic story/world building of a MMO that got people like me to glance at single Player Final Fantasy once again. Hence why I'llstill state that Yoshi P and Creative Business Unit III seem to be last bastion of people that want Final Fantasy to be new and unique once again. But we'll see when FFXVI lands.
                I'm hoping they're learning from their mistakes. FF7R really was an enjoyable game that I could not put down. I usually don't finish most games I buy tbh.. So to me its a really good game. definitely can name flaws, but the pros definitely outweighed the cons.
                    It feels to me that Square has tons of talented people out in their company, but has difficulty reigning them in and making them focus. I think sometimes it is a clash of creative egos (which happens a lot in creative spaces, music, film, animation, etc.), sometimes it is mismanagement by the guys in charge, lack of understanding of certain technologies (i.e. FFXIII), or sometimes it is having too grand of a focus that is difficult to translate to a game (i.e. KH3, FFXV/VSXIII). FFXIV was successful partially because Yoshi P and his team found that the 1.0 team, though talented lacked focus and that sometimes caused chaos.
                Square Enix has a ton of amazing talent they just have difficulty focusing it. Yoshi P's biggest achievement was focusing the talent of the FFXIV team so hopefully he can work his magic from the start here.
        Sounds like an all-star cast but this trailer having 50% of the time dedicated to introducing random countries and politics we aren't familiar with is giving me Triangle Strategy vibes.
        I'm still concerned. I feel the way xv failed most was it was a single player mmo. Bunch of hubs with repetitive quests to earn XP and rewards to allow you to progress. My father was murdered. My kingdom taken over and in ruins. That one soldier guy in the movie gave his everything in that fight like a badass. I'm collecting frogs and fishing and having some great photos on my fab-bro camping trip. 

So I hope the xiv team keeps it feeling like a jrpg rather than an MMO.
            The reason FFXV failed was because of everything happening in the background in development, there was no consistency and it was sort of a rush job. All things considered it's a miracle it turned out the way it did. This game does not have anywhere near the baggage
                Nowhere was it more apparent that it was a rush job than that town you go to for Leviathan. That town was *way* too developed for it to be a one-off quest area, it was clearly intended to be another town you could regularly visit, maybe even a second hub, but all of that was casted aside. 

Imagine what XV could have been like if it was led by the XVI team. The same graphics, the same exploration, the same combat system (which, honestly, is deeper than most people give credit for), but done in a way that doesn't just feel like a road trip with the bros. 

[I still think back to when XV was originally called XIII Versus.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6At_bb1PNU)
                    Agree completely. The game was terrific until then. Terrible after
                Rush job? That bitch got started and restarted like a dozen times and took forever to actually come out. Don't forget XV started as part of a threesome of games that was supposed to be XIII
                    Yes, and the last build was a rush job. That's what I meant by that.
            XII was the "singleplayer MMO". And now, especially with the Zodiac Age version, its pretty well-received.
                XII was ahead of its time in many ways.  The few tweaks with Zodiac Age keeps the game feeling extremely modern.  Like if you told me Zodiac Age on switch was a new game released last year, I would believe you.
                It was mixed amongst fans.  It wasn't bad per se, but it definitely wasn't everyone's cup of tea.
                    Definitely mixed - it’s actually my personal favorite. Depends on who you ask
            FFXV failed for me because the combat was trash and the story required too many extra-curriculars.
                > and the story required too many extra-curriculars

To date, it's the only mainline FF that requires those extra-curriculars to comprehend the story in full. No other FF does this.
            I mean, FF14 isn't like that at all. Its story lives up to and eventually (Heavensward, Endwalker and especially Shadowbringers) even surpasses the peaks of single player FF. The common line is 14 is a traditional JRPG with a MMO tacked on to the endgame when you finish the story.
                Ahh how soon we forget the several hours of quests where you have to gather supplies to throw a party for yourself before you're allowed to fight Titan.

Like, 14 has narrative high points for sure. But its pacing is pretty wack by nature of it being an MMO and it is inarguably 'like that' as you put it.
                    It's a little disingenuous to use their earliest content as the benchmark for CBU3 instead of the all recent stuff that they've won piles of awards for. There are of course obvious limitations to the gameplay and storytelling as a consequence of FFXIV being built on a decade old MMO, but the real meat of FFXIV's story succeeds on it's own merits. You could rip it all out of the MMO and build a (very long) singleplayer mainline title out of it with minimal adjustments (Mostly just getting rid of the filler quests), and it would still be phenomenal.
                        >You could rip it all out of the MMO and build a (very long) singleplayer mainline title out of it with minimal adjustments

People really underestimate how long the MSQ is. People regularly complain about JRPGs breaking the 40 hour mark, and that includes gameplay. FF14 is over 20 hours of cutscene time \*per expansion.\*

[https://www.reddit.com/user/Cyberfunk3/comments/y5gauf/ffxiv\_tracker\_62\_update\_improved\_formatting/](https://www.reddit.com/user/Cyberfunk3/comments/y5gauf/ffxiv_tracker_62_update_improved_formatting/)

A quick eyeballing of time says I 100%'d the Pixel Remasters of 1 through 4 (\~115 hours) in less time than it takes to watch cutscenes in FF14 (\~123 hours). That's watching the extended version of the LotR trilogy 10 times, and still leaving time for bathroom breaks! If you could play all of the MSQ cutscenes sequentially without having to do dungeons and walk places between them, you'd be able to put the controller/mouse down for \*five days.\*

This is tolerable when you're playing it as it comes out, but don't undersell how gargantuanly long the story is, or how much of an advantage the MMO format breaking up these story sections over literal years helps.
                            Yeah I recently created an alt and just finished the 2.0 content. Sure the story content itself is about 20 hours, and I'm honestly okay with that, but I broke it up with a *lot* of side content. I leveled all my crafters, did every blue quest I came across, and, in general, lollygagged around for days just enjoying myself. Play time came out to around 80 or 90 hours by the time I cleared Praetorium.

And it still felt like it went by in the blink of an eye. So when people say they "slogged" through ARR I just question how out of touch I must be with those players to have genuinely enjoyed myself so thoroughly for like 4-5x the length of time it probably took them to do it. Or maybe just enjoying the content on offer rather than forcing yourself to binge the MSQ is the key to having fun with it after all. Who knows? I definitely agree that people downplay how much the MMO aspect helps that long stretch of story *work*. The world wouldn't be as interesting without it. Your achievements wouldn't mean as much. A solo version of FFXIV wouldn't really be the same.
                                Well, for me 80 to 90 hours of playtime means about six months in real life, so the idea of levelling crafters (or BOT/MIN) without being able to fly or having a huge bank (i.e. spending a lot of time walking everywhere) is not that appealing to me. Different strokes for different folks, but I’m happy that I rushed the MSQ (some friends of mine just decided to buy the ARR quest skip instead) this time instead of bailing halfaway through because the downtime to meaningful content ratio was too high.

Persona 5 was for me a game that while long (first playthrough took me 120 hours spread throughout a year), stroke a good balance of having content interspersed with good fluff. So far post-ARR seems to be working out well enough for me, but I’m afraid it might be a couple of years until I actually get to Endwalker.
                        I picked the Titan thing because it's a particularly egregious example and I'm trying to go lighter on spoilers for newer content. But there are absolutely places in Shadowbringers and Endwalker where massive forward momentum for important characters and the plot in general screech to a wailing halt so that we can meet brand new people who don't matter and spent waaaaay too long, say, building robots in the desert with them instead of actually completing someone's story arc. 

Again, I'm not saying 14 is bad and I'm not saying it doesn't hit hard when things are firing on all cylinders. But to make the point that it doesn't feel like an MMO with a ton of filler quests in hubs to pad out the runtime is absurd.
                            They fixed this part in recent updates though I thought.
                                The specific thing I'm talking about in this post happens in Shadowbringers, so I doubt it. I know there was a pass at some point to cut down on some of the fluff in the really old content but I suspect they didn't get rid of all of it.
                                    As someone who very recently finished ARR, it's still so slow and bloated (especially the patch quests) that it's almost hard to believe it used to be worse.
                            Yeah almost every major event is precluded by a lot of meaningless quests where you gather something or have to travel someplace to talk to someone else only to then fo back to the first place
                    I haven't forgot it at all, trust me we FF14 fans remember it all too well lol (hell, the part in Return from Ivalice that's an ill-considered parody of the Titan questline was recently cut from the game because everyone hated that bit too).

But in a game that has spanned 9 years with 300+ hours of main story content and 100s of hours of side story content, the fact you're reaching for one of the earliest questlines in what is universally agreed to be the weakest part of the game that doesn't hold a candle to ShB and EW actually proves my point as much as anything.

And yeah I'm not claiming every single quest in that 300+ hours is a masterpiece, the pacing can be fairly slow at times and occasionally you can get quests that border on padding (level 88 Sharlayan...) but these moments pale in comparison to MSQ meaningfully pushing the story forward in some way or another.
                        I like how you say "we FF14 fans" like I'm not one of you. I didn't beat Endwalker because I hate the game or the story. But people come out of the woodwork to chop your head off if you imply anything is wrong with the plot.

You could cut *a lot* out of it and it'd be exactly the same or better. I knew I'd get a ton of people trying to *got you* me by pointing out my example is old, but it absolutely still happens. I just don't want to fill my post with Shadowbringers spoilers because unlike ARR it's actually genuinely great sometimes and I don't want to ruin that for anyone.
                    It's not even good pacing for an MMO. FF14 just has an amazing story that you have to do completely mundane stuff to progress. It could almost be billed as a whole new type of interactive storytelling experience. That's not to say the mmo aspects of the game aren't good, but they're only present in the questing portion of the game when it forces you to group up which honestly just annoys me at that point because I'm vibing on the story even though group play is why I started.
                        This has been updated. They recently cut out many meaningless quests to make this part of the game more enjoyable.
                            I played through post-patch ARR recently, and while I wouldn't call many of the quests *meaningless* exactly, it's still wayyyyyy longer and slower than it needs to be, especially post-ARR/pre-Heavensward.
                            Yeah they cut some stuff but only so much that it went from absolutely absurd to slightly ridiculous.
                    Which is from ARR, the worst part of FF14 and also not what he was referring to. He explicitly calls out 3 of the 4 expansions as being better stories. 

ARR needs to get a full revamp, it very much does not sell what kind of game the rest of the game is, which is a shame because it's most people's first taste.
                FFXIV is exactly like that. I played through arr and some of the bridge content before the first expansion. There were plenty of times I was doing grindy, repetitive stuff to level up so I could do the next main quest mission. It had more of a cohesive story than other mmo's, but it was very much still an MMO. And who can forget dungeon: the movie? I was grinding that for some cosmetic event with a friend and I swear we spent more time watching a movie than actually controlling our characters. 

And let's be honest, the story in arr wasn't really anything great. It was pretty standard stuff and predictable as hell. Compare that to other ff's and it just pales in complexity, character development, and originality. Maybe the expansions improved, but the core game was only a 7\10 at best for an RPG story. 

I could go on about what I think is the right and wrong way to do MMO stories, out what makes a good singlet player story vs MMO, but I won't.
                    Are you of the impression that this is controversial? ARR is a solid "Ok.". It really is nothing more. 

Get through Shadowbringers and Endwalker, and I have now played the best story, characters both friends and villains, soundtrack and writing in all of FF. Possibly my favorite in all gaming.
                    ARR is barely even the prologue of the game. FF14 dramatically changes in quality from Heavensward on. It's not considered the best mmorpg for nothing.
                    Literally nobody talking about how good FF14 is refers to ARR. The guy literally said Heavensward, Endwalker and Shadowbringers.
                    You played the worst bits of the game and didn't touch any of the actual stuff that FFXIV won a shit ton of awards for. Everyone agrees that there are a lot of low points in the game, but the highs are well up there, enough to make FFXIV in the top 3 of FF, even the best for many people.
                        The worst bits of the game comprise the entire first 50-ish hours of mandatory content. I like FFXIV but I really can't blame anyone for dropping out during or right after ARR because it's boring, long, and mandatory. It's an extremely valid criticism of the game.
                    I don't think many FFXIV will disagree with you that ARR's story was okay at best. However Heavensward, Shadowbringers and Endwalker are definiately what people will think of when they talk about FFXIV's amazing story. I'll say that FFXIV has hit a groove in 'how' they tell the story, but this 'how' isn't really for everyone.
                    ARR is not what people talk about when they describe FFXIV as a really good story. And the game is nine years old and has very much learned from it's early iteration.
            I didn’t get that vibe from XV at all, it felt like a regular open world game - I think XV fucked up by releasing too early and splitting the story across 1000 mediums. I played Royal and loved it - but from what I’ve read the story is even MORE jumbled in the original and it was really disjointed feeling.
                I just plain stopped in the original.  Didn't remember a single thing that happened one day, had no attachment to a single character.  I just had no idea why I was playing.  I replayed the Royal and it definitely clicked more... that being said, I'm still not much of a fan.  The combat was super lacking, and the story needed a ton of editing.  And the game movement just took forever.  I got tired every time I hit a new zone.
            XV didn’t really fail as a whole. It sold really well and the general consensus is everything before the linear last 25% of the game was great. I remember me and a friend feeling like it was one of the best FFs we ever played…and then the linear ending happened.
                XV didn't fail but it probably did lasting damage to the brand being the second mediocre Final Fantasy after XIII (with XIV 1.0 wreaking havoc in the background where the single player fans couldn't see). It still had the "Versus XIII was the real game" hype behind it at release which was hype that started in a time when there was more reverence for the Final Fantasy franchise. XVI is the first one that has to deal with the consequences of XIII and XV's mixed reception.
                    For the hard-core fans probably, but people don't like to admit that FF is a very broad appeal franchise, with the majority being casual fans.  It's the most mainstream JRPG by a wide margin.  Each mainline game just needs cutting edge graphics, and it'll sell like hotcakes
                The linear ending was annoying gameplay wise, especially not knowing you’d be stuck there till it’s over, but story-wise it really kicked the shit out of me lol

Though it’s nice they let you go back for endgame
            I was pretty hyped for the game after seeing the movie. You roll out into the open world in the car, go up to a gas station, and get a quest to go find beans.

Talk about disappointing.
                Seems pretty standard for the start of any RPG, can't be taking down bosses the size of gods asscrack right out of the gate, you gotta be collecting 10 bear asses and giving some herbs you found on the floor to old lady dithers to treat her back pain.
            Well good thing not even FFXIV is designed like that. And Yoshi-P has commented multiple times that FFXVI is like a fast paced roller coaster so that seems to go against what you are describing.
            I wouldn't worry about it. FFXIV team have mastered the craft of making an MMO feel like a jrpg rather than an MMO (complete with a full npc party system and basically a traditional JRPG structure to its story) so I'm sure they are fully aware that this game shouldn't just be FFXIV offline. With each new expansion the game felt less and less like an MMO with jrpg elements and more and more like a JRPG with mmo elements (in a good way) so I don't think they'll fall into that trap. 

FFXV also had huge development issues, the game was essentially developed in 2 years so they had to resort to MMO style quests to fill gaps. Same kind of situation as Dragon Age Inquisition's content.
        *Dragons Dogma/DMC5 Combat Director*

REAL SHIT???
        >With Yoshi P at the helm, the Heavensward writing team

I definitely got a lot of FFXIV vibes from the trailer and that now makes sense, I knew YoshiP was working on this but not the Heavensward writing team.
    I'm one o the Sickos who love FFXV (just began my, like, fourth playthrough) but XVI looks *special.*
        That's nothing. I'm a huge fan of XIII. Truly sick
            There are dozens of us! DOZENS!
        There was just so much *heart* in FFXV that it excused pretty much every obvious shortcoming the game had for me and easily became one of my favorite FFs. It's a broken game but damn is it memorable. 

I'm keeping a close eye on Forspoken too because it's the same team, even though I fully expect the same kind of criticism to come up at release
            >I'm keeping a close eye on Forspoken too because it's the same team

Tabata made XV what it was. Forspoken is helmed by some western Hollywood-type writers, so I wouldn't expect the same.
        Same. Feel-wise, FF15 might even be my favorite FF game. Yes the other games might have better combat systems you like, and most are finished and not rushed at the last half, but no other Final Fantasy game had made me feel sad about "no more adventures with my party" when the credits rolled. What FF15 did so much better than literally any other party-based RPG I've played (and I've been playing since NES) really makes you feel the bond between the party members. In many of the games your party is a group based on opportunity, you all have the same goal or similar direction of goals. But in FF15, you're a group of friends and they really nailed it.
            Man, I didn’t even know there was FF15 hate. That’s definitely my favorite FF game, personally. I loved the combat, characters, and settings so much. The story was whatever, but most FF games in the last 20 years have been that way. Doesn’t detract from how much fun that game was for me, though.
                i knew there was a decent amount of hate, but i think its mostly just cause its so different of a game from the classic FFs. doesnt appeal to the same type of person i guess
                    The release hate was justified. The most complete edition (Royal edition I think?) adds so much content and extra context that I would say the game deserved a re-review. The base game was missing so much.
                    >doesnt appeal to the same type of person i guess

Nah its more it just wasn't fleshed out enough, there brilliance under the surface but the game just skips past it.

For example a big moment should have been Ignis going blind, yet the how is completely skipped over devaluing the drama that comes from it.

XV is decent, better than some others in the series, but the development hell it went through absolutely marred the final product in a big way.
                    In my experience the hate isn't due to any inherent negative with the gameplay, characters, or story. It's that they put the story out in a movie, anime, and other random places rather than in-game. Then rushed through the in-game story. Then to top it all off, canceled half the DLC which would have completed the story.
        I beat XV when it was released. Now that I have the upgraded PS+ and I saw that it has the Royal Edition I have been thinking about picking it back up. I've heard Chapter 13 is a bit different than when I played it last.
            It is, and there's an option to play a shorter versio - it's moreso you switching every now and then from playing as Noct to playing as The Bros.
        Boy band simulator XV is not a good game but it is fun to play. The atmosphere is just enjoyable.
        Reddit is being it's usual contrarian self with regards to 15.  It had the most promise and intrigue of an FF since the golden PS1 era.  It had a very troubled development.  Nomura was trying to make the ultimate Final Fantasy.

And I don't want to be negative but everything so far 16 looks very basic.  Western kingdoms warfare with Kings/politicians and very generic character design (Nomura gets too much hate, but atleast his characters at this point in time are very iconic, and stand the test of time), combat built upon the backs of 15 and FF7R.  

In the end people can say what they want about it but 15 had *heart*.
    dunno, mate. gonna be hard to top the masterpiece that is Stranger of Paradise.
        You're probably joking, but SoP is likely my favourite game of 2022 so far. Even the story is great and later explains why Jack acts the way he acts. I always wonder if people who shit on it actually gave it a fair chance!
            Honestly even if the story is dumb like most people say, I think it looks fun. Just waiting for the steam release in another year or whatever.
                It's dumb in kind of a smart way (well, at least they try to make it so).   

There is a reason character interactions in the beginning are so weird and outlandish.
            tbh i don't think i'm even joking, mate. i tried the critically acclaimed ff14 and found it to be more a visual novel than a video game as the quests were atrocious and the early dungeons were in exercise in pressing 2-3 buttons on repeat. and all the good content seems to be an expansion or two in but i'm also told the story is a big part of the game and how i shouldn't skip it and i do not have the patience for any of it. 

but stranger of paradise? that is a video game, with gameplay, and it's fun in it's opening hours. a winner in my book.
        I want a DLC for FFXVI where Jack appears and he Jacks all over everyone.
        Hope we get a good sale for the holidays so I can finally play that gem.
        True GOTY, the morbius of video games
        Someone in the trailer says something about chaos, so I'm gonna go ahead and assume this is a direct sequel to SOP.
        Chaos.
    FFXV could have been a lot more enjoyable with a better combat system. I really didn't like combat in thst game.
    This may be a weird place to ask but are there any games that play like Kingdom Hearts 2? The combat was so good and I feel like a lot of games haven’t jumped on it’s train. 

FFVII Remake was the closest I’ve seen. I feel like XV was trying but everything felt so sluggish and heavy with the slower animations and bad framerate on console
    The mainline FF games usually feel like they’re made by people who are still trying to figure out what being a “Final Fantasy” game even means.

The FFXIV creative leads (who are making this one) don’t have that problem. They have a confidence and surehandedness of vision that everyone else at Square Enix lacks.

The tough thing about FFXIV is that it’s an MMO and not everyone is into that. But FF16 looks like it’s going to be FFXIV storytelling with more accessible action/RPG game systems, which is a really good recipe for success.
Hearing that [uniquely gravely voice in the trailer](https://youtu.be/u-SdiYbSGIQ?t=31) of ~~the squad leader~~ Ramuh's Dominant at the 00:32-time stamp makes me 99% sure it is Steven Hartley; voice actor of [Eredin in *Witcher III*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTcC1RDJxw4), and [Petrus from *Greedfall*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weqbmJO1nsQ). Makes it very likely it involves [voice agency SIDE](https://sideglobal.com/projects), which given their track record in other fantasy games (*Dragon Age*, *Final Fantasy XIV*, e.t.c.) makes me very excited for the acting performances in this game. Still can't pen what other voice actors are in this game; [the Archduke of Rosaria sounds](https://youtu.be/u-SdiYbSGIQ?t=52) reminiscent of Sean Bean to my ears (And it wouldn't be the first time his involvement in FF with him voicing King Regis in *Final Fantasy XV: Kingsglaive*-film.), but I don't think it is quite him.

EDIT: [The official site just recently got updated with new character bios](https://uk.finalfantasyxvi.com/character/).

EDIT 2: Just me who thinks Square is now just showing off with how they make [water droplets being shaped on the edges of freaking hair strands of Barnabas](https://youtu.be/u-SdiYbSGIQ?t=236)?

EDIT 3: So it seems [Jill will be utilizing a rapier as her weapon of choice](https://preview.redd.it/1k4biwlb2zu91.jpg?width=4096&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c6db15e8c88d58ef23d1c5399f637bdee7fcd235), as well as in her [Shiva-form](https://preview.redd.it/7zqx7dhb2zu91.jpg?width=4096&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bf1db76fb8af57661be8a759a64c0ae86b4cf071) With the canceled [*Final Fantasy versus XIII*'s Stella](https://images2.alphacoders.com/112/112430.jpg), and [Alisaie from FFXIV](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/finalfantasy/images/c/c2/Alisaie_Leveilleur_in_FFXIV_Endwalker.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20220718095621), is it safe to say that we now will have a new FF-tradition of rapier-wielding women in FF?

EDIT 4: There's a brief [shot of a dog at 00:37-mark](https://youtu.be/u-SdiYbSGIQ?t=37), which lends further support of said dog being [Torgal, the pup](https://youtu.be/yr6PtdY0i7M?t=56) in the first trailer all grown up. In the previous "Dominance"-trailer, some sharp-eyed viewers managed to spot [what appears to be a grown-up Torgal fighting alongside Clive and Shiva against Liquid Flame](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFXVI/comments/vl19ew/torgal_fighting_alongside_clive_in_the_dominance/), so seeing now Torgal in this recent trailer seems all but confirm that the dog will be quite involved in the game.

EDIT 5: The trailer actually has official English captions, and in the segment of [a mook kicking Jill to the ground](https://youtu.be/u-SdiYbSGIQ?t=179) has it marked the henchman of speaking in a foreign language, translating as *"Prime, or the girl dies!"*. Seems we will be hearing some unique fantasy language in this game, which isn't too much of a surprise considering FFXVI's English localization director, Micahel-Christopher Koji Fox, made up the [Dragonspeak-language for FFXIV's *Heavensward*-expansion](https://forum.square-enix.com/ffxiv/threads/265400) complete with a [small dictionary to it.](https://forum.square-enix.com/ffxiv/threads/265527-Dragonspeak-Dictionary)

EDIT 6: So on closer inspection, the gravely-voiced NPC speaking at the start turns out to be Ramuh's Dominant later in the trailer. There's already been some speculation that Ramuh's Dominant may be Cid; perhaps a nod towards many of the developers's previous history with *Final Fantasy: Tactics* with that game's version of Cid having the epithet of "Thunder God" in his name, connecting with Cid being given a thunder-association.
    See now I thought the VA from the beginning might have been Ralph Ineson, the actor (The Dad in The VVitch, and Dagme4 in GoT). It wouldn't be the first time CBU3 got an English actor from GoT to voice act in one of their games.
        Oh, you are absolutely right; Ralph Ineson is also a good possibility. And yeah, the developers CBU3 having at least one *Game of Thrones*-actor per game is pretty much tradition at this point. The actors of Roose Bolton, Gendry, Aerys Targaryen, Yara Greyjoy among others have voiced in FFXIV. Maybe I need to also start watching *Bridgerton* to find if their actors are involved in FFXVI, considering the character Anthony played by Jonathan Bailey is also voicing in FFXIV.
            I don't know if it's SIDE or CBU3's English localisation director doing the casting and directing, but they've managed to strike absolute gold with most of the voices, which is amazing since a lot of the best performances are from actors without many credits to their name. Rene Zagger as Emet-Selch and Matt Stokoe as Elidibus give unparalleled performances.
        100% Ralph. Bloody good rep
        Thank you! I was trying to figure out why I recognized that voice! I saw The Witch a couple weeks ago. And I knew the voice in this trailer sounded familiar!
        I had no interest in this game but if it is Ralph Ineson I might actually check it out.  I love just hearing that man talk dramatically.

Also near the end I think I heard another actor that I really enjoy his voice
    I was thinking the gravely voice is Ralph Ineson from The Witch
        Finchy!
        Finchy! Bloody good rep.
    Side isn’t an agency but instead a studio. Others in the U.K. include Liquid Violet (Souls games), Pitstop (Total War) and OMUK (I don’t remember lol) plus others. There are far more agencies and they get the auditions from these studios that are then distributed through their rosters for the casting directors at whatever studio to look through and decide on. Actors can also be on the books directly for these studios and get the auditions without an agent middleman but that’s decidedly rare here in the U.K.

Certain studios only collaborate with certain agencies too; I’ve had plenty of auditions from Pitstop and OM but none from Side or LV. There’s a bit of an agency hierarchy in London lol.
Next year has a very heavy lineup for AAA games, but this one is probably what I'm excited for the most. They seem to really be pushing the bar when it comes to their cinematic style. Also, that one scene with the guy teaching Joshua about history seemed right out of the Game of Thrones pilot. This game in general has some heavy GoT vibes.
    Heavensward in general could be described as "The FFXIV writers discover Game of Thrones" and this is written by the same writers. And it's M rated, so they can actually show some gore.
        Honestly I like the sound of that. There’s been several fantasy JRPG’s (including the last FF) that I’ve tried to pick up that I felt could have been amazing with a bit more grounding like you would see in some western media. I think Japanese fantasy is often better at embracing the truly fantastical and feel like you’re really seeing another world with different rules, but sometimes at the cost of feeling like you could live there and that everything doesn’t have to be quite so… Shakespearian maybe? The world and magic can be over the top without the characters being quite so artificial and theatrical I guess, which has been a problem with FF and why I just can’t seem to connect with the FF7 remake in the same way as the original despite loving the gameplay. On the other hand I think western stuff can get way to bogged down in the wrong details and can be too focused on being “gritty” and “realistic” to its detriment. I think both sides have their own strengths that set them apart, but I also feel that both could learn from each other in regards to their weaknesses. More than anything I’ve just wanted to see more fiction that meets somewhere in the middle.
        Even in 1.0 and ARR you could see the GoT/ASOIAF influence.
I really love the style they’re going for with this one. I know people like the future fantasy thing they often attempt, but it’s rarely cohesive or fully realized outside of like FFVII. The more grounded medieval fantasy is cool and seems to have kept them more focused, FFXIII and XV just had so many loose ideas that didn’t come together.
I’m 95% sure that the rumor that a PlayStation showcase was totally delayed/canceled because of the Activision M&A was right at this point 

Absolutely fantastic trailer. Summer can’t come fast enough
    I don’t think it was happening this year at all. They clearly don’t want to step on GoW’s toes and Naughty Dog has already said they’ll have something to show in 2023 about Factions. All signs point toward early 2023
        2(?) trailers and very little gameplay. I think we'd be lucky for late 2023.
            Well they’ve said they are launching 2 unannounced live service games before the end of the fiscal year which is in March/April I believe. So they’re going to have to show them eventually along with their next slate of games. I believe God of War is the last game from their initial showcase for when they announced the ps5. They’ve seen to do announcements in waves and wait until all those games are out or almost out to announce the next phase.
    > I’m 95% sure that the rumor that a PlayStation showcase was totally delayed/canceled because of the Activision M&A was right at this point

This rumor sounds so fucking stupid that it exists to fuel idiots that are invested in idiotic console wars on Twitter.  Playstation just simply didn't plan to do a big showcase this year period, there was no they would cancel one over the CMA, just cause of the deals they would had with third parties alone in regards to marketing.
        I don't know if that's the reason, by there wss 100% going to be an event in october. Silent Hill 2, FF XVI trailer being announced the same day there were leaks for a trailer of Spiderman 2. Too many coincidences related to Playstation.
        The entire gaming industry is fueled by so much pettiness that I can 100% believe that this is exactly what happened.

Or did we all forget that grueling phase in 2020 where both Microsoft and Sony basically tried to tiptoe around the prices of their consoles until literally 1-2 months before launch, waiting for the other company to reveal their price first?
If anything this thread has proved everyone's definition of what Final Fantasy should be is just "how similar is it to my favorite one"
    Game is going to be a total flop because it looks nothing like Tactics Advance

Doesn't even run on the GBA at all smh
        Well the world does seem to have some Ivalician vibes... I can't even remember if the Ivalice in FFTA was the real one or not though.
            The art director for XVI, Hiroshi Minagawa, essentially created the look of Ivalice alongside Yasumi Matsuno. Minagawa was art director on FF Tactics and Vagrant Story, Co-director on FFXII.  There's a ton of Ivalice staff at CBU3 working on FFXVI, but he's arguably the biggest
    That much is inevitable when FF has 20 different interpretations of what it is. Can't please them all.
Oh my god, this game just keeps looking better and better with each trailer. Mad props to the team for making this game look absolutely beautiful. Whether you're a fan of the combat or approach to gameplay the more recent entries have gone, you can't deny that the art direction is an 11/10.

This is a Day 1 for me.
    Will be a day 1 for me as well, regardless of if the game is “good” or “bad” because sometimes I just simply like pretty things to look at 😂
        It’s a day 1 for me because I'm a Final Fantasy whore
            Yeah I probably should have led with this as well lol
            This is the most apt description of me lmao. It’s insane how strongly this franchise is still kicking all these years later.
            I preordered Final Fantasy Explorers back in the day, AMA
                Same. I even own the Collectors Edition of World of Final Fantasy.
            Not to mention a Soken whore. I really want to see what the mad genius (and he is) can do with this canvas.
    It'll be a Day-1 and maybe a Collector's edition purchase if early previews turn out great. I have faith in YoshiP and his team to at least deliver us a captivating narrative experience if some of the FF-traditionalisms (combat, lack of party building) are lacking/omitted from it. 

I just want to be excited for a new single player Final Fantasy game like I was a teen. So I hope it delivers.

    This is one of the few times I actually prefer the English VA over the Japanese VA from a Japanese game studio. 

It's insane how good the English VA is.
        Pretty sure the English VA was done before the JP VA. So the OG language is English this time.
            It makes with the mouth animations lining up so well, and it just sounds like it was written in English rather than translated
    Odd, the OP required me to sign into YT to view it but this one didn't. So thanks for the mirror! 😁
Also, a message from producer Naoki Yoshida and director Hiroshi Takai.

Giant swords, handsome dudes, magic crystals, unleashed powers, over-the-top battles, stupefying architecture, intense melodrama, austere narration.

Yea this is Final Fantasy for sure, bring it on.
please just tell the story in the game and don't require 4 different mediums to understand what's going on
"Don't get hyped, don't get hyped, don't get hyped...ah shit I'm hyped" 

If this game can get even close to the emotional level of ffxiv story at its peak it's going to be good story wise. With Yoshi P at the helm I have a good feeling it will.

Now I'm most curious how the gameplay holds up.
Just based off of the blood from the one guy getting stabbed and then seeing his head fly off, are we about to get an M rated Final Fantasy game?
Creative Business Unit III is such a troll name I can't believe it's real.

They could call it "Creative III" and it'd be instantly better
    Here in Japan it’s normal to have a department name with number on them. (Sales Unit 1, Dev Unit 2). It holds no meaning, so arbitrary, changes every year, yet Square-Enix managed to turn it into a brand, I’m astonished.
    It's kinda hilarious especially with how consistently competent they've been on FFXIV.
    I'm guessing they stuck with the name because SE and especially XIV fans who paid very close attention to the internal structure of SE were openly calling that division by their internal name for the better part of about 3-4 years prior to the reveal of XVI, since that division did not have a public name until that reveal.

Before they were CBU3, they were Business Division 5, until SE's internal restructuring happened in... I think it was 2019, when they got renamed into CBU3. Rumors of XVI being developed by BD5/CBU3 began as far back as late 2016 with job recruitment postings and people disappearing from XIV credits post-Heavensward, with people referring to the dev team by those names even from that far back.

It's actually pretty frightening that people accurately figured out exactly which staff was actually working on XVI a whole 1-2 years before it was actually revealed, just by looking at XIV credits, job postings for the division, and interviews posted on SE's recruitment page. For example, we knew Ryota Suzuki was the lead combat developer for XVI and that it would be an action RPG about 8 months prior to the actual reveal for the game, because of an interview saying he had been hired by SE for an undisclosed game at the time.

They probably figured that since people loved them enough to keep such close track of their internal affairs, they may have decided to openly call themselves in public by their internal name as a sign of pure confidence.
    The name makes more sense when you consider it’s just a subdivision of Square Enix and not an actual independent game development company.
In Yoshi-P, we trust.

Also sucks we won't see a PC release in a while. I don't see a need to get a PS5, at all, especially since Sony is dropping their games on the platform.
    Has that been confirmed? I feel like I’ve seen rumors both ways.
        I feel its fairly safe to say it won't be a day 1 release at this point. Silent Hill 2 just got announced for both PC and PS 5 and that was on day 1 of that games announcement. 

Unless they got some special contract with Square I think its safe to say this will be an exclusive for some time.
            The first trailer, during a [State of Play 2 years ago](https://youtu.be/tjji8NEW9lo?t=296), said that it will also be available on PC, but the [standalone trailer](https://youtu.be/CUY9beBLIKM?t=221) just says PS5. The last trailer and this one don't mention platforms at all. A simultaneous PC release is not guaranteed, but it's not completely out of the cards either.
                As I understand it, this was a error and they've stated FFXVI will not be releasing on PC, at least not on day 1.
            Probably going to be 1 year PS5 exclusive then 1 year Epic Games Store exclusive.
    and that kind of thinking is exactly why they will try to be more exclusive with releases.
        But Final Fantasy isn't a Sony product, it is released by Square Enix.
    And with this unfortunately goes away all my will to play it... 

Being on gaming discords, final fantasy subreddits, ffxiv ingame, and various other forums and media, it will be impossible to avoid spoilers for years till it comes to PC. Even more if they sell their soul to epic once again as square is wont to do.
        Yup, I've given up playing FFVII Remake since they refuse to release it on Xbox. I don't have a PC powerful enough for modern gaming.
    I wish Japanese publishers would move on from console exclusives already. It really sucks having to buy something I know will become a useless paperweight as soon as I'm done with the one game I wanted. This game looks great and I probably will end up caving but 60fps and below is so hard to go back to...
        They're developing a game that costs dozens (if not hundreds) of millions to make. When Sony comes knocking with a fat pay check that's probably worth dozens of millions Square Enix are never going to say no. [Same thing happened with Nintendo and Capcom for Monster Hunter Rise timed exclusivity.](https://old.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/kdmopd/nintendo_paid_around_6_million_for_monster_hunter/) And Microsoft do that too of course with Gamepass and other exclusive titles. 

We're never going to get out of this as long as the big 3 are willing to put so much money on the table for exclusivity, it's too good to pass up on it for studios. But Square Enix are by far the worst ones when it comes to that, they'll take the console exclusivity money, then they take the EGS PC exclusivity too.
        Even without any exclusivity deal a PC port would likely arrive later. For quite a lot of Japanese games and developers the focus and priority is console, for me personally this is one of the reasons why I tend to prefer console when it comes to gaming.
            Yeah. PC market in Japan is non-existent. Heck, even Playstation and Xbox are on the mud. Only console fourishing there is the switch because of its portability. And mobiles.
Based on what gameplay was shown, if it wasn't labeled as Final Fantasy, I'd assume this was a fighting game.
    That's what I am seeing - just seems like another Devil May Cry/Bayonetta kind of cinematic hack and slash.
        >just

you say that like we get more than one good DMC/Bayo every couple years. High quality spectacle fighters are few and far between, while high quality JRPGs are fairly common.

I get that it's not what people come to Final Fantasy for, but as a fan of both genres I'd gladly take one in the underserved genre if it actually turns out well.
        The lead combat designer here was poached from Capcom after working on DMCV. It *is* a DMC fighter.
God I wish FF wasn't married so hard to PS :(

I miss them since I stopped console gaming at PS2 (besides Wii and Switch).
I know they get ported to PC but idk how good the ports are. FFX/-2 seemed good but idk the newer ones. Plus 15 looked just... meh. Cars in FF sounded awful to me lol
    12's remaster is good on all platforms i've played it on (switch and pc)
    The port quality is so extremely bipolar for FF. It's seems like the FF 15 port is decent but then FF7R has barely any options and bad stutters despite being UE4, and with the older 2D games it's a toss-up of shitty pc port of mobile port or the newer pixel ports that look better but have other issues. FF9 and FF10 seemed fine to me but then apparently 13 runs like shit. It seems to really depend on the mood squeenix is in and the alignment of the stars lmao
I wonder if I'm in the minority. I really feel like that having a party of distinct characters is an integral part of the FF experience. I couldn't get into 13 and 15 only because I didn't feel like the other party members really were participating, and this one seems to be completely ditching the party. The disappointment from that completely negates my excitement, even if the game is showcasing fantastic visuals.

Edit: I realize that it isn't clear from my post, I mean the others are not really participating in the combat, especially in 15 it felt like I was doing all the work and the others were just running around looking cool.
    No obvious party gameplay is one of the main complaints people have had about FF16
        Guess I've missed those, they are nowhere to be seen around the visible part of the reddit comment section.
            A lot of conversation about it happens over at r/JRPG and r/FinalFantasy.
    I agree about having a party. But I'm playing through FFXIII and it has a big focus on the party. Everyone seems very well balanced, story wise and gameplay wise. Your party is split for large portion of the game and you have to play as all of them for some time at least. There are other issues with the game but I like the balanced party. It feels like a group of people handling things together, rather than everything revolving around one person.

Now the stories of a couple of the party members may not be as interesting, but that is a different issue I think.
    It doesn't negate my excitement but it is the thing that I hate bout the new direction of these games.  I liked having more direct control of my whole party.  FF7R was probably the best implementation so far but if I need to focus on one party member I like controlling the mage and the way aggro worked made it impossible to stay on Aerith for any reasonable amount of time.

Overall still excited for this game and will likely be getting but yeah... it's something that definitely bothers me.
    I have to disagree about 15, even tho it had some solo segments, I felt that the entire game revolved around the party, heck eqch of them recieved a solo dlc to expand their story and character depth.
        I didn't mean story wise, I mean combat wise. I couldn't even tell how much of my damage and/or control was coming from the party, it seemed like I was doing most of the work and the rest were floating around waiting for a special double team combo, which made them a glorified weapon rather than a party member. I played the game for about 20 hours before moving on to something actually exciting to play.
    I feel exactly the same way. Yakuza 7 is the game that made me realise this. With it's change from action to turn-based I saw what was gain; a true sense of camaraderie between the team. They felt all involved, and working together. Which in turn made their characters feel much more fleshed out and important. The characters, and the sense of there being a true team, is what really defines Final Fantasy to me.
    It's something I sorely miss too. I'm sure this will still be a great game, but a party is a key part of scratching that FF itch for me.
        I'm just kinda tired of the multiple-warring-countries in the background trope.  Feels way overused by now, and not just in Final Fantasys.
            Then in the end you find out all the events were manipulated by Badasss Badguy Sadchildhood, who summoned the God of Whatever, so the politics didn't even really matter.
    This game looks great and I plan on getting it, but I feel like it shouldn't be called Final Fantasy. So far it looks like a straight up action game with no party members and Devil May Cry combat.
    Honestly, I'm having trouble getting into and latching onto any of the characters from these trailers at all. It kind of feels like a generic JRPG story. I'm sure that would change once playing it, especially since everyone is hyping up the team behind it, but right now it doesn't grab me at all.
    Its disappointing, but not that big of a deal to me. I'll get my fill of that again with FF7R part 2
Is that Ranni's voice actor? It sounds a lot like her.
So glad they dropped open world and focused on more important matters this game looks beautiful and still will be vast!! looking forward to **SUMMER 2023**
Wasn’t sure if we were going to see gameplay in this. But the reveal of it was perfect. I really enjoy them showing gameplay as early as they did in previous a announcements
This trailer has cemented this game as my most anticipated game for 2023. Looking forward to this even more-so than FFVII Rebirth.
Wow I'm excited! I guess the KH-inspired action battle system is here to stay after 15, that's cool. 

I think the art direction looks incredible, I like that they're doing the usual FF story themes/plot points, but the entire look of it is much more grounded.
I watched this and lamented about where Final Fantasy went. There’s nothing here that feels spiritually like the games I grew up with, and if the trend continues this will be an action game with loose RPG elements. Obviously I’m in the minority, and that’s ok.
This will be at least good, probably great. It isn't the team who made FFXV making this, it's the team behind FFXIV.

Also, this trailer confirms to me that there's no PS Showcase this year.
If this game is good (and signs are pointing toward "yes"), then Yoship has a blank check from me for whatever he touches going forward.
My buds like to tease that they gave Nomura FF7 remake so he can be CC locked on that development and let 16 really flourish under a new team. 

Teasing like that has some kernels of truth to it. I really am excited for 16 and have a lot of trust in Creative Business Unit 3.
My most anticipated game from my favorite video game franchise. I might take a bit of time off to play this on release
PC announcement soon right...? Hahaha...I'm gonna get spoiled on it's entirety before it releases on PC aren't I :^)
    Yea... Summer 2024 probably, rip.
    Honestly it can go either way. Square Enix just hosted a stream last month where they essentially advertised Steam to the Japanese market.
    Don't worry, its Square's MO to sell exclusivity to Sony and once that expires they go to Epic and ask for more money.
Honestly one of the best trailers I have ever seen for me personally.

I am so excited for a good, medieval single-player final fantasy again. It’s been so so long.
    Really? Looked extremely generic. No distinct art style, the most basic of JRPG setups (bunch of medieval era kingdoms going at each other), moody rote dialogue, uninspired character designs, disappointing music that fades into the background (yes, Soken is amazing but there wasn't anything here that stood out to me). There wasn't really anything about this that made me go OMG FINAL FANTASY! If they didn't bust out the summons related aspects I'd have no idea it was an FF game.

This is what a Final Fantasy trailer can look & sound like:

https://youtu.be/y8gJe_7xQKc

Really gets your imagination going for whats to come and show's Square's creativity on full display.
        Only thing I get from that trailer is that there is a protag, there is a rival, there is a romantic interest and there is an antagonist. And there are magic and mechas. I have not played VIII so that's as close as you get for a 1st impression.
        What's the difference between a shitty $1 fast food burger, and a gourmet burger from a Michelin starred restaurant?
        [removed]
        okay so. I'm not disagreeing with you about the 16 trailer.  It didn't give much to really dig into beyond "new Final Fantasy, with good visuals, and good music, and good voice acting" which is all stuff we'd already gotten from previous trailers. Some minor world-building but nothing that really excites.

However your counterexample is kinda... bad? Like I watch that trailer and I don't really get anything. I recognize some things because I already know about FF8, but if I didn't then... there's two guys with swords, and there's a girl, and there's a big robot. I think motorcycles? And the music is pretty generic. If you're going to go with a bunch of disorienting quick flashes for your whole trailer they need to be things that leave me mouth open, reeling at the possibilities or the magnitude of what I've just seen. Works well for horror, or for things that have really out-there environments or character designs. Or bringing back a bunch of things I already know (preferably in new and changed ways). Basically it needs to do better than two guys, a girl, some motorcycles, and a bunch of feather transitions. That gives me nothing, except maybe that it looked really good at the time in which case hey we're back at the 16 trailer again.
The gameplay we’ve seen looks fun I just wish I found the story more interesting, though that’s probably a minority opinion. I just am not really interested in the Game of Thrones / western rpg vibes.
    Final Fantasy has always had that top layer of different nations and politics. It has nothing to do with Game of Thrones.
    No i feel the same way. The story and characters are not grabbing me at all. Not saying it needs anime spiky hair and zippers, but nothing about this feels exceptional or different from any other "serious" jrpg setting.

I'm sure playing the actual game would change that, especially knowing the team behind it, but the trailers just arent interesting to me.
        [deleted]
I feel like I am the only one who is not excited for this game. I just dont like Medieval fantasy that much. I much prefer the more Steampunky and Modern/Futuristic FFs. But I also consider FF12 my favourite so...
    There's been a good amount of sci-fi fantasy in ff for a good while now, it's nice to have an old fashioned classic one.  I personally prefer high fantasy like this and 13/15 being modern/future settings I'm glad they threw us a bone.  Plus you guys have FF7R.
    There is a ton of FFXII and Ivalice staff working on this game, including a co-director of XII who is now the art director of XVI, Hiroshi Minagawa
That music is god tier, I can't wait until some songs get officially released so I can put them on repeat hopefully before release.

This looks so good. Next year is legit looking to be an amazing year for games, and it's not even just games that probably get delayed like most years. I highly doubt many if any of FF16, Legend of Zelda, RE4 Remake, Starfield, Spider-Man 2, and Diablo 4 get delayed past next year. Then I could add on several more games that I'm personally excited for.
Everything thing about this game looks completely bland. Can we get a trailer that shows the characters talking about anything other than vague political drama?

Have we even seen the main fucking character talk at all in any if these trailers?
    I have to agree. As someone who thinks the gaming community *vastly* overrates the story of FFXIV, I am worried about this one. For all their faults, FFXV and FFXIII at least tried to tell unique & compelling stories - I get no sense of that at all here. It looks like someone made a fighting game out of the FF summons.
        Lol I’d probably prefer a fighting game with final fantasy summons over what’s been shown
I'm a little disappointed by how everyone looks so... shades of FF14 character creator? I miss the days when you could "who's that pokemon" with Final Fantasy character designs straight from the silhouette.

“One describes a tale best by telling the tale. You see? The way one describes a story, to oneself or to the world, is by telling the story. It is a balancing act and it is a dream. The more accurate the map, the more it resembles the territory. The most accurate map possible would be the territory, and thus would be perfectly accurate and perfectly useless. The tale is the map that is the territory. You must remember this.” - Neil Gaiman

Too many games these days are losing themselves in making the most accurate map and in that, losing the story.
    It's definitely the most toned down FF style-wise, in line with FF Tactics I'd say. But Yoshida's character art for Tactics is really memorable.
    Same impression here. This feels like a lot of recycled concepts from XIV. I wish they'd strayed further and tried to do something new without any ties to crystals or Eikons or even having pastiches of the powers in Eorzea.
    It's always remarkable what people come up with to feel disappointed in something.
        I mean the defining trait of Final Fantasy from a marketing perspective as far back as the SNES days has been character design that permanently sears itself into your brain on first look. Every game from VI to XV (with the exceptions of XI and XII) have had at least one character that has become a pop cultural figure beyond the realm of video games from sheer strength of design alone. And the OP is right that these character design are taking cues from XII.
            I don't think we know confirmed details for the developers/designers for a lot of this game yet but Akihiko Yoshida (FF12 character designer) was the main character designer of the 3rd FFXIV expansion and along with Matsuno has been collaborating with YoshiP a lot recently.

He very well could be the character designer of FF16. There are of course rumors Matsuno is involved in the game too.
            > And the OP is right that these character design are taking cues from XII.

And what's the problem with that? Are you saying the character designs in 12 are generic? Lol

Not enough Bishonen kpop guys I guess.
        It's always remarkable how people like to brush off someones genuine skepticism as just them making something up to be disappointed about.
        It's valid criticism though. What's the issue with people having different opinions on the game?
    I’ve actually gotten the same feeling. They all have the vibe of either PCs in 14 or the generic NPCs. No one has really popped.
This is the best square has to offer, a new age all star team handling their top franchise. 

Really excited and hopeful that final fantasy returns to the spotlight in a good way.

Also, Soken is a god.
About 20 dudes who all look the same and one woman. Seems pretty standard for FF these days. Would love to see a bit more diversity in their characters' personalities. Guess we'll see how it goes.
    Two women thank you very much.
    I miss having so many different female characters in Final Fantasy. It was a huge part of what made me a fan in the first place.
    almost 700 comments and there are like 2 of them mentioning the stark lack of women present in any capacity. women leaders: seemingly 0. women characters with voiced lines: 1 very briefly at the very end. 

No women appear at all until halfway through the trailer and the first is naked, silent, and behind a man. the next one is bound and kicked to the ground by a man and is silent. the next is a scantily-clad enemy. Finally there's a wordless scream and a single line. No other women present past those very short examples in the 4.5 minute trailer.

I had played every FF until 15, and part of why I didn't play 15 is the lack of women rep. I had really hoped that would be a one-off and 16 would be better, but this is creating a lot of doubt for me.
        The one bound has been in previous trailers wielding a rapier. She is the adopted sister of the main character. The chick in bed is the 2nd in command of the evil nation and one of the eikon warriors. J get the feeling she will swap sides after falling for one of the good guys in the story.
        Yep it is very glaring when you notice it. Got some whiplash going from FF V, VI, VII, XIII.... then dropping into XV. I've only played like 5 of the 13 total Kingdom Hearts games, but I feel like it suffers from the same. Of the few main gals only Kairi mattered and she was relegated to being a damsel.
    [deleted]
        Yeah ff13 was like released 13 years ago. 15 starred 4 identical dudes and the first thing we saw in this trailer was that again. Followed by 5 or so male monarchs. So yes, these days, looks like it's just all men.
            Not true, look at FFXIV, the 3 main starting cities are all led by women, the group you are part of was led by a women too and in the group there were an equal-ish split of women and men. It changes over time but the pint still stands. 

As for FFXVI, because of the medieval setting it probably makes a lot more sense to have a male dominated cast but we've yet to play the game so we'll see.
[removed]
    It looks like we are not getting it day 1 on steam anyway.
        And not day 365 either, since Square is going Epic first when porting stuff to PC nowadays.

Day 730 it is.
            [deleted]
            That actually seems to be changing, slightly - Triangle Strategy and FF7: Crisis Core are both releasing to Steam day-and-date with the Epic version.
This game looks so good!! I just really really hope we still have a party and they’re just not showing them yet because it’s spoilery
I don't want to get excited for this game... but it's hard not to admire what Square Enix has made here.
Final Fantasy XVI: Game of Thrones 

While this is indeed a well produced trailer something about this game hasn’t exactly lit a fire in my heart. I think the character designs are rather weak, the game is far too dark in terms of lighting as well. I also can’t escape the feeling that this game was developed while Game of Thrones was still the hottest IP in media history. From my understanding, the FFXIV writing team had already been using GOT-like storytelling starting from Heavansward. “Gritty, dark fantasy” world also doesn’t inspire a lot of excitement for me since it seems rather passé at this point. 

With all that said, this game can’t turn out worse than FFXV which is easily among the worst mainline FF games ever put out. I trust that Yoshi P and his team have actually crafted an interesting world to explore and memorable characters to meet — it’s just not coming across to me in the trailer. 

Am I excited? Yes and no. This comment isn’t meant to yuck anyone else’s yum and I am glad that there is excitement again for a mainline FF game.
    XVI is part of a lineage that started with Ogre Battle, Tactics Ogre, Final Fantasy Tactics, Vagrant Story, and FFXII. Many key team members (most notably Minagawa and Maehiro) worked on one or more of those games and were inspired by Yasumi Matsuno's storytelling and world building. The Ogre series predates the publishing of the Game of Thrones book.

They are similar in that they are medieval fantasy, but Yasumi Matsuno's work came first.
    I just don't see what everyone else is seeing besides the pedigree behind the scenes. I'm sure the actual game will be good, but I can't get attached to the setting or characters at all. This looks no different than all the other gritty medieval fantasy JRPGs we've been seeing recently.
        >This looks no different than all the other gritty medieval fantasy JRPGs we've been seeing recently.



Give me a couple of examples that have similar level of fidelity. Would genuinely love to check those out.
            > fidelity

Well now we're talking about 2 different things. I'm talking about art direction, story, and characters. I'm sure in terms of "quality" it's miles ahead of anything else. It's SE's flagship JRPG after all.
                Sure, but are those other JRPG at least 3D? Fidelity is part of art direction, Triangle Strategy and GoT might be similar thematically, but still feel very different to me.

I was just wondering if there are games that look close to XVI, because it appeals to me a lot.
    > I also can’t escape the feeling that this game was developed while Game of Thrones was still the hottest IP in media history

It kind of still is. House of the Dragon is kind of as popular as GoT was

Also the gritty dark fantasy is present in other very popular stuff like Attack on Titan or Arcane for example.
Seems like Final Fantasy is continuing the trend of creeping closer and closer to Devil May Cry with every iteration. At least that's what I could gather from what I saw here.

Doesn't look bad though. I'll wait for the gameplay reveal.
I'm a huge fan of FFXIV and FF in general but XVI honestly just doesn't look that great to me - tonally and graphically it just seems very flat.

I'm sure the combat is fun and the story will be good but I'm just a sucker for Tetsuya Nomura characters and vibrant worlds.
    > tonally and graphically it just seems very flat.

Weird you say that being a FFXIV fan, since it probably takes aesthetic inspiration from there (and XII) more than any other FF.
    Yeah, unpopular opinion but I love the Nomura settings so much, even if the gameplay/mechanics are questionable sometimes. I can’t tell you how much I want another game in a pseudo-modern fantasy sci-fi setting like 13 or 15 again

Edit: not to say this game doesn’t look good. I’d probably give it a shot if it came to PC but it looks like I’m waiting till 2024 lol
        In the context of the series I'm glad to see a return to pure fantasy. I *love* fantasy mixes of steampunk, modern times, and whatever else but they haven't gone hard on fantasy like this since the 2D era. FFXIV is amazing but despite it being the most fantasy feeling one yet it still does go straight Sci-Fi quite often.
            Even the first Final Fantasy has robots and a space station.

Final Fantasy 4 is as much sci-fi as it is medieval European fantasy and it's awesome for it (it also throws ninjas and martial arts in the mix because it's [the rule of cool](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool)).
        Here I am just wanting X vibes again.
            X-3 please
        Am excited for XVI but completely agree with you. Hoping KH4 can scratch some of that itch (though it's definitely some years away from release)
            Absolutely, can't wait for KH4! Obviously still excited for this game but it just isn't grabbing me right now.
        You have had your pseudo-modern fantasy sci-fi in FF13, FF15 and FF7 Remake. Geez, leave some for the rest of us that want some novelty in our lives.
    For me, I feel like I need to stop treating Final Fantasy games as Final Fantasy games and just act like it's a new title. I'm still bitter just because I miss and loved the old turn-based combat. I end up just going in disappointed to every new title as a result as, once again, they keep trying to "update" it and make it cool.
    I think I'm personally just kind of oversaturated in this type of medieval fantasy setting right now. Even if you aren't following all of them (I'm not) it's everywhere and hard to ignore. GoT/the new show, LotR/RoP, Elden Ring, Dark Souls, ~~FFXV (despite having new tech)~~, FFXII, or SoP. Grand political stuff just hasn't hit the same as the weirder FF plots like VII or X for me. This could still go somewhere for sure, but right now to me its just  more broody castle stuff
        TBH I wish they went all in on the grand political stuff.

FFXV to me felt like it didn't have much grand political stuff and the stuff it did have was pretty on the surface type stuff.
        FF12 was 17 years ago. FF15 is definitely sci-fi fantasy. FF7 Remake is sci-fi steampunk fantasy. And the rest you mentioned are not even remotely related to FF.

We haven't had a regular fantasy experience in the singleplayer games in 17 years and you are oversaturated? This is ridiculous
        buddy if FF15 is too "medieval" for you then I really don't know how an FF game could satisfy while still justifying the "fantasy" in its title.
            FFXV was definitely not the right vibe I was thinking of, I’m mostly remembering altissia being very cathedral-y apparently
        It doesn't even seem like we'll written broody castle stuff tbh.
        For sure.

I'd take a X-3 over anything else right now personally
        FFVII and FFX got political too. VII with the greedy corporation and X with the religion.
    For me it's the exact opposite, the setting and return to more classic medieval fantasy looks stellar, I like the more bleak tone and warring nations thing they're setting up, but absolutely nothing they've shown for gameplay looks interesting at all to me.
        I don't mind/love the setting, FFT was one of my favorite games after all, but this all looks and sounds generic. I'm not sure how this setup is any different from Square Enix's lower tier RPGs like Triangle Strategy and the like. They've made plenty of these kinds of games over the past few years themselves. This one just has higher production values (but not high enough to be worthy of the FF moniker, IMO, this series has always pushed the envelope w/ presentation).
            Definitely Triangle Strategy vibes from the "look at our many warring cultures: the normal one, the snooty one, the Arabic one..." bit.
    It made me have a real boomer gamer moment. I had no idea what was going on, between the seemingly convoluted political intrigue to the people animorphing into summon spirits. Combat looking like a series of cutscenes in between button mashing.

Then I couldnt help but laugh when the super serious guys and gals with gruff English accents started talking about crystals. The series obsession with crystals as magic holy McGuffins no matter what the setting is will never not be funny to me.

Listening to To Zanarkand the other day had me nostalgic but after seeing this trailer just...man. We ain't never going back there huh?
    Yeah I feel the same, I was wondering if I was the only one. I'm just so tired of all the FF characters looking like the same smoothboi. Aside from that I still hate the new action combat style FF has adopted since 13ish, but I'm aware that's probably just me showing my age and I guess at this point I just have to accept that FF is a game I watch now instead of play. I hope the story is good though.
        The three Final Fantasy combat system since XIII are nothing like each other so I'm a bit confused about what you find bad in common about them.
            I would argue it actually goes back to 12, not 13. It's the idea that you pick one character and AI controls the rest. I'm not counting 11, because that's an MMO, but in 1-10 you control your whole party. From 12 to (seemingly) 16, you pick one character to control, and the AI does the rest. That "frees" them to make the combat more interactive. I put "frees" in quotations, because in practice it seems to actually just result in every character playing like a fighter, because the mages are best left to AI, since they require the least input, and the AI will control melee very suboptimally.
                Oh I'd totally agree it just felt like 12 was sort of a weird experiment that although it's easy to see how it inspired what came after it, was still different enough that I felt like I shouldn't say 12 and beyond, but honestly you're right.
                I found the opposite. If you left the AI in control of the makes then they would chew through your MP far faster than it would replenish. 7R didn't even bother having the AI use MP.
            [deleted]
                Yep agreed, and those were also some of my favorites (including Persona for me). I mean I don't begrudge them for changing the style and I'm not out here shaking my fist saying they need to go back; if it's making them more money etc. that's just the way things evolve sometimes and I get that, it's just personally I'm not a fan.
    I think we’ve just had so much of the newer age FF that people are happy to go back to this medieval era classic style final fantasy. It’s been since like FF9 since we’ve had that.
I have never been this hyped for a game and I've been gaming for 30 years. As a longtime FF fan, I've had my share of disappointments over the years but this one absolutely feels different. Maybe it's the magic of Yoshi-P but I feel sure as fuck that this game is going to blow my socks off.
There's something about these japanese and square graphics that make them look like plastic dolls. Ff7 had a nice mix but this reminds me more of dragon's dogma.
Probably gonna get flayed but I really have never liked the FF UI design, like the pop ups during combat and stuff really take me out of it. Game looks so good though.
    > I really have never liked the FF UI design, like the pop ups during combat and stuff really take me out of it.

Nearly every single FF has been different...kind of a weird opinion to come to under those circumstances.
I’m not going to grief anyone that is excited for this but this just isn’t doing it for me.  Their reluctance to show more than a few seconds of gameplay just solidifies that they made a Devil May Cry game and flavored it with Final Fantasy.  And if that’s exciting for someone, I’m happy for you.  But this is looking more like a pass for me.
Not much gameplay in there, but honestly, this looks great.

But is it really Final Fantasy without an ultra-androgynous protagonist?  The dudes here all look pretty *dudely*.
    every leader of every faction is also a dude. either with a beard, big muscles, or both.
    I wouldn't call Tidus androgynous, but we've definitely never had a dude as dudely as this guy before.
    what final fantasy's have angdrogynous protagonists? the only one i can think of is MAYBE onion knight.
        I put a huge list below but the early arts were pretty andro for most protags, but usually when they reappear in games like Dissidia they look better.

Except for Bartz. He really went for the full David Bowie, eye-liner, andro supreme look.
        7, 10, 15 all have pretty boy protagonists. Maybe 12 if you consider Vaan the protagonist but he's really young and Basch doesn't fit that description. 

As for the rest I'm thinking about it and 6 and 13 have clearly female protagonists, I wouldn't call Squall androgynous, 9 has a goofy art style that doesn't make anyone look androgynous, 11 and 14 are MMOs. 

All of Amano's characters look extremely androgynous but 1-5 are old enough that the pixel art doesn't really capture his art style that well.
            Vaan's the guy you walk around as outside of combat, so I'd definitely call him the protag, as much as there is a single one.  And I certainly wouldn't call Squall or Zidane "dudely."
                Yeah if the question is just whether or not the characters are dudely then zidane and squall definitely don't qualify as dudely. Squalls got enough edgy bad boy vibes so he doesn't seem androgynous to me and Zidane is like a weird monkey boy who I wouldn't call manly but he's very boyish.
                >Vaan's the guy you walk around as outside of combat

He's the errand boy
                He was added post Matsuno basically as the character the player could identify with instead of a dude in his mid 30s - I can't remember if Basch or Balthier was meant to be the player character early on. Everything rotates around Ashe though.
                    Basch was the original main
        7, 8, and 9 are the big ones. 15 not quite so much but still firmly in pretty-boy territory.
        Yeah I can't think much about that either. Tidus is perhaps not really beastly, but Squall is mannish, Cloud has a pretty face but obvious man muscles. I guess Vaan? But he's also mostly a child.
            Vaan kind of has an excuse too, the execs wanted a young relatable main lead so they shoehorned him in, which is why he kind of just feels like he's tagging along on the journey and basically stops being the main character 5 hours in.
        Vaan from ffxii comes to mind.
Got dayum, the gravitas this trailer gives off is awesome. Also the narration kinda reminds me of Ranni, dunno if it's the same VA though.

I like that not only are there Eikon vs Eikon battles, but also battles as Clive against the Eikons.
Can't wait for control to be taken away from me every 10 seconds to do walk and talks. And press x to initiate a 5 second animation to open a door or climb ladders.
I don't get all the hype, this seems like the most generic boilerplate JRPG I've ever seen based on the trailers.
    FFXIV fans and Matsuno (FF Tactics, FF12, Tactics Ogre) fans eat all this political and world building shit up. I love it and the character action gameplay.
        I'm still sad that Matsuno's stuff in 14 wasn't that well-received and Matsuno fans won't get another taste.

Ishikawa's stories are a bit too character driven for my taste.
        The politics as they presented it thus far looks even less interesting than the trailers for Triangle Strategy or Diofield.
I hope I don't have to wait forever for a PC release on this one. 

Also, is this an Ivalice game? Because if so, my hype is through the fucking roof.
    It's not Ivalice, but Yoshida is a HUGE fan of Matsuno's work so expect a lot of similarities.
        Really? The trailer mentions Rosaria and Dalmasca so I was hopeful...
    If it *isn't* set in the same world there are a lot of coincidences when it comes to place names. Valisthea shares the "valis" part with Ivalice. Rosaria is essentially Rozzaria. Dhalmekia is quite similar to Dalmasca. The design of the armour reminds me a lot of the Judges, and even the focus on crystals is something it shares with FF12.
Honestly, if I was out of the loop, I feel like I could have mistaken this for a FF14 trailer. Music and writing seem on point. Very very excited for this game.
Is there no party in this? All the combat I've seen is the one guy by himself. I'm gonna get it (eventually on PC) regardless, unless it bombs, but I do like the party based combat of 15 and 7 remake.
As someone who has not really played the series, can someone TLDR me on why its like fantasy/medieval setting now? Last game was modern no?
    Each game isn't connected. They are entirely different universes that has some similar elements between them (i.e monsters, eidolons, names.. etc) .  It can sometimes be a futureistic setting, mordern, medieval, or a mix of all.
For a mainline FF game, yes.

For Final Fantasy as a whole, Final Fantasy Type 0 was rated M.
    Whoa..you're right. I wonder if it's the introductory scenes with the war that escalated it to M, because I can't think of anything else in the game that would make it an M.
        To quote the ESRB:

> This is an action game in which players assume the role of students fighting to protect their nation from invaders. Players traverse fantasy environments and battle enemy soldiers and other creatures in melee-style combat. Players use swords, bows, firearms, and magic spells to kill various enemies (e.g., robots, blobs, mechanical beasts). Battles are accompanied by realistic gunfire, screams of pain, and large blood-splatter effects; some sequences depict blood stains on players' screen and corpses lying in pools of blood. Cutscenes depict additional acts of violence: a man stabbing himself with a sword; a girl shot by a sniper; a character shot close-up. During the course of the game, some female characters are depicted in outfits that expose large amounts of cleavage and jiggling breasts. In one sequence, players can use a spy camera to zoom in on a female character wearing a bikini. The game includes event scenes in which a character sedates/drugs players' character and performs unknown acts on them; it is implied that some of these acts may be of a sexual nature.
            If you told me this description was for Fire Emblem, I wouldn't question it.
                Doesn't get that much breast and cleavage in Fire Emblem Three Houses
                    Nah, but Heroes more than makes up for it
            Aiit I'm preordering this game now. 😭 These ratings just sold me.
                I'm pretty sure that's for Final Fantasy Type-0, not FFXVI
        In Type—0 at the end of each battle you steal your enemies souls as they’re vaporized into a cloud of red mist… the game has a lot of scenes that are pretty violent and bloody.
        [removed]
            They're talking about Type-0 I'm pretty sure
                Yep!
    Why wasn't Stranger of Paradise R? It was a big boy adult game >:(
        It WAS M rated though... Also had the first FF f-bomb
            also had the first FF Limp Bizkit-bomb
            That was an awesome scene, too.

People can say what they want about that game.  It knows what it's about.
                It was about stopping chaos?
        Rated C for CHAOS!!
    Stranger of Paradise too
Yoshi P. finally got the M rating he's wanted 14 to have
    Wait, the game where one of the antagonist's backstory is that she was sold into sexual slavery by her parents is only rated T?
        Theres a LOT of dark themes in 14, that i am surprised that still T, i cant imagine what more stuff Yoshi P and team will created if the game was rated M.
            Endwalker has two scenes in a particular zone that I still can't believe are in a T rated game.
                Yeah, >!dunno how they got away with some dude putting a gun in his mouth and pulling the trigger with a T rating tbh.!<
                    Yoshi-P's team has mastered the art of "implying but not showing" in FFXIV. You never actually seen the guy put the gun in his mouth, but the audience could put two and a two together within the context.
                    A guy shot himself on-screen in Insomniac's Spider-Man and that got a T.
            They said they wanted *that* scene in Shadowbringers to not happen while obscured but couldn't because of the T rating
                Which scene was this?
                    Poor Tesleen.
        The keyword here is implication
As long as they don't say that's what happened all's good

But a wink wink nudge nudge doesn't hurt
Just about everything looks like its in-engine at the least, and it's come leaps and bounds since that first reveal trailer. 

The Eikon battles look extremely unique so there must have been some insane work put into this game. Everything looks bespoke and not copy-pasted.
    What's interesting about the game engine that *Final Fantasy XVI* uses is that there have yet to been any confirmations or announcements what engine it is; among speculated has been the Luminous Engine, Unreal Engine, an extension of FFXIV's engine (Itself once been an amalgamation of both Luminous and Crystal Tools.) e.t.c. It wasn't until last month that a user at the /r/FFXVI-subreddit managed to [scour a technical presentation Square made back in 2018](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFXVI/comments/x2ro5c/which_engine_would_ffxvi_use_crystal_tools_or/imlavqh/?context=3) of what was at the time a secret project, but which showcased models that were later to be shown in the FFXVI-trailers of Sanbreque's knights, and where FFXVI's director, Hiroshi Takai, served as model demonstrating of this new engine's features. Summarized was that this secret project at the time explored initially features with the Unreal Engine 4, but which the development staff found the results unsatisfactorily to their goals, to which an extension of the FFXIV-engine was utilized, as well as full time-programmers being hired solely to further develop on this engine. This times well with how later in [2020, studio CBU:III was in recruitment of further staff (Lighting director for instance.) for FFXVI, while also announcing their base production and scenario complete, while further developing of their toolsets](https://www.gematsu.com/2020/10/final-fantasy-xvi-basic-development-and-scenario-production-already-complete).

The engine-speculation was further stoked by how Square Enix last month made [trade-marking for what they called the *Radec Engine*](https://www.gematsu.com/2022/09/square-enix-trademarks-radec-engine-in-japan), which we have no information other than the name itself of what it entails of. So far, Square currently mainly utilizes Unity, Unreal Engine, Luminous Engine and FFXIV's engine for their games, so question remains what this *Radec Engine* is to be, and if FFXVI is the first entry of it.
        Interesting. Square Enix invested a lot in the Luminous engine, and it was surprising to see FF7R use Unreal instead of their own, presumably very costly, engine.

Luminous definitely still has the potential to bring consoles and PC's to their knees, and FFXV still looks great. I thought SE has given up on their engine but perhaps there's more life in it with FFXVI
            They're using Luminous for Forspoken. Looks basically exactly like 15
Have you played FF14 at all? The composer for most of the tracks in that game is doing this one, so if you liked this trailer you can find literally dozens of hours of music he’s done over the last decade for 14. Soken is awesome.
    I have not, I spent 6 years playing WoW so I'm sworn off all MMOs going forward lol. 

I do have a few friends who have played/still play FF14 and they always speak highly of the OST, so I knew Soken most likely would deliver.
        If it helps FFXIV is designed around *not* keeping you addicted. The devs literally said they want players to just play for a bit every new patch, then return back to other games. There's no daily logins, they dont remove content and its designed so old content is always active, and they're even adding the ability to just play through the main story with an NPC party over other players. You can basically just play through it as a singleplayer game by design.
            Came to say this! I signed up summer of 2020 so I could mentally survive the pandemic and its been one of my best gaming choices ever. No pressure.
                Me and my friends joined just before the pandemic kicked off and its been a wild ride. I already enjoyed the game but once I reached shadowbringers it became an all-time classic rivalling the rose-tinted glasses of the other games. Endwalker launch was a special time for me too, theres a great feeling of community running along the main quests with all the other players, and its great just being able to pop on a few times a year to catch up on content rather than feeling obligated to be on every single day.
                    Endwalker was my first time being truly caught up to MSQ. There's a certain *je ne sais quo* about going through an area and seeing two dozen people in the same innocuous spot, all watching a cutscene.

I sped through the entire expansion in a week, and to this day I still think >!Ultima Thule is one of the most beautifully haunting area in the game, if not in games period.!<
                        That last walk was one of the heaviest things I’ve seen from a game.
            [deleted]
                there is a free trial you can play the base game and first expansion up to level 60. I hear it's critically acclaimed....
                    Specifically speaking the trial takes you through one of the best story arcs in the game with the Heavansward expansion, it will give you a really good idea if the game is something you want to continue
                It does
                > Does it still require a monthly subscription?

The game has multiple expansions

A Realm Reborn > Heavensward > Stormblood > Shadowbringers > Endwalker.

You get to play ARR and HW for free, which should last you about 200 hours. ARR is a bit slow, but HW has a great story.
                    Another note is that if you buy Endwalker you get all the previous expansions with it. Only ever need to buy the latest expac, and you get all of them.
                        But if you buy the game keep in mind that you can't access the trial anymore. So you should play until lvl 60 and finish heavensword and then buy the game
            It'll just take half a year of casual play to catch up.
                Nothing to really "catch up" with if your main draw is the campagin. Just go at it at your own pace and enjoy one of the best rides in video games.
                    Yeah been playing it at a pretty slow pace for over a year and am at Endwalker, been an incredible experience and I'm really glad I haven't rushed myself.
                    Sure but when you have friends talk you into it like most of the time when you get into an MMO and everyone's excited about this new expansion coming or that new patch and then it's like cool but in a year and a half you can be there.
                The thing is, unlike WoW, the "real game" game isn't at the end. The game is the journey as well as the destination. It's amazing.


You can even join a guild (Free Company) and they can *join you* in the biggest moments, their levels getting synced down without making the content completely trivial for people who haven't seen it a million times. It's just a really fun game that goes on and on and on. ...Once you get through most of ARR. Ooph.
                    I agree the story experience is breathtaking, but even then the actual gameplay during questing is somehow even less engaging than leveling usually is, and I could not stand how on one hand the game was constantly making me disband my party to do certain quests but then on the other hand would make me join other big parties to do others, and some of those big group quests would be brain dead dungeons or they'd be challenging raids that you actually needed to study up on to get past. It's like I had to both care and not care more than I wanted to the whole time.

But again when you really were into the story it's like you could've dropped all the gameplay and just traveled from story beat to story beat. Whatever quests had you actually do felt like afterthoughts.
                        Oh 100%. One of the things I miss from WoW is how clever and variable the quests got over time. Still simple stuff, but different.


14 has some neat stuff but it comes later on in the form of solo duties, and those and few and far between. Many agree basically solo boss fights. There was one brilliant and memorable one in Endwalker, though.
                        I think the core problem is the first 2 expansions, despite their attempts to fix them (it’s been over a year for me, maybe 2?) are a real slog story wise IMO.

So unless you can skip through it but still get the story to lead into the other stuff it’s a big ask for a casual player. But they’re doing something right so my archmchair analysis is worth less than a grain of salt.
                > It'll just take half a year of casual play to catch up.

Way more. The main campaign that gets you to max level alone is what, 600 hours long?

I no lifed it last year, from ARR to the end of Endwalker, and it took me 2 months to finish it.

But the MSQ is the game's strongest point by far so that's fine. It's a fantastic story.
                    It really is.
            when is that npc update out you think?
            > You can basically just play through it as a singleplayer game by design.

That's because it is a single player game at its core. 

After reaching EndWalker, I can say this game feels like a 300 hours cinematic where you occasionally kill mobs and rarely group with other players.
            > There's no daily logins

Are you sure you played the game? There's both daily and weekly grinds, golden saucer, and a bunch of other random stuff with daily/weekly caps.
                Oh, there’s always something you can spend your time on, but none of it is mandatory. You can always get caught up in short order if you step away for a time.
                    Same is true for WoW as well. Return at the start of a new patch and you have a bunch of catchup mechanics.
        I'm a 14 year WoW refugee. Zero regrets. No addiction (except the "addiction" of wanting to play any games you look forward to), but I don't feel like I'm missing out if I don't play for a week.
            The problem with FF14 with me is that the game require a monthly sub, and I would feel guilty if I only play 2-4 hours a week. Hence I swore it off instead of trying to play for the sake of playing.

That is why I like GW2 better...I can quit for six years and still be ready to go through end game content cause GW2 gears don't become obsolete.
                I usually just put FF14 off for a few months and come back when there’s a few major patches of content to get through. I don’t really see it as an MMO you keep coming back to every day. At least unless you really love the world and get sucked into every side activity. 

Even the endgame’s progression is very short once you’re there, so it doesn’t feel like you need to stay subscribed for months.
                Sure--that makes total sense to me.

I've also been a Final Fantasy fan since the original in the 80s, though, so 14 was an easy and nostalgic sell for me when I transitioned.
        I feel like we’ll all be in for a treat with 16 because Soken really hasn’t missed in 14.
        Here is Soken. Bow before his majesty. https://youtu.be/shWBppGY5G4
        I mean, if u like singleplayer rpgs then ff14 is a great choice. the mmo stuff is optional. Its just another final fantasy game with some multiplayer elements. They are even making it so that you can do the whole story without interacting with other players.
    Do you know... la hee? 

Man I love Soken. I can't think of a single track I would mute (other than the Gold Saucer music, but I feel like that's their way of discouraging you from staying in the casino too long!)
        I turn off the battle music, just gets in the way of the nice area themes. Especially the night ones.
    [Are we acting like FF 15 didn't have an amazing OST either?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkKVUswNxX8)
        No. I was pointing out that since the person above me liked the music in the trailer they might want to check out the music in 14 because that’s the same composer.
        "I really like coke!"

"Wow I can't believe you're hating Pepsi like that"
    Do you know.... Lahi?
Still waiting for any gameplay besides combat 3 trailers in. So far it seems to be cutscenes -> combat in an arena-> cutscenes -> combat in an arena -> repeat. It could certainly still be a good game even with just that but I hope there is more to it.
    It's been discribed as a roller coaster of action by the producer so it might be cutscene > small gameplay segment fighting mooks > Eikon fight loop, which to be fair when your character can channel the power of gods at will it's hard to find regular people that would be a challenge. 

We also haven't seen much signs of monsters.
        There were a Morbol and a Coeurl in the initial reveal trailer, at the very least.
FF ost and music were never the weakness part of the franchise. It has been consistent
>Still very little actual gameplay shown

The very few snippets like that dodge counter against Titan have me hopeful though.
I'm hoping that they're holding off on showing gameplay because they're looking to sizzle hype for a while longer before collapsing the epic event of The New Final Fantasy into... just a video game. However, the more cynical side of me says that they're still not happy with how the combat feels and are trying to fine-tune it further before showing us more than disconnected fragments. Given that it's still over half a year from launch (and maybe close to a full year) that's not a *terrible* sign even if it is the case. They've still got plenty of time for tweaks. But if it's not there yet months after the game is supposedly "basically done," or if the *performance* isn't there yet which is another strong possibility, then they may have some real trouble closing it out no matter how much time they've got.

Oh well. Hope it's just marketing. At the very least this trailer showed some very solid voice acting, and that Dominants can Devil Trigger for more manageable boss fights instead of always being the size of a building.
    The reason why they don't show gameplay that much is because YoshiP is known to be such a stickler when it comes to trailers. In fact, if it was up to him, he wouldn't even release trailers now. He would release it like 6 months before release. He really hates spoiling things early. Only reason we are getting trailers is because he's being forced to.

They already mentioned that the game is at the final touches. Whatever gameplay you think they are hiding because they are not satisfied, is already done. They have been doing QA for the last year now as they mentioned in a past producer letter.
        okay but I don't. Really believe that. I don't think that this game is going unreleased through a year and a half of QA without there being any significant parts of it they're unsatisfied with. Performance issues are currently my frontrunner and would be a very strong reason for not showing off anything besides cutscenes \~9 months out from release. I am aware of what Yoshi P prefers but a comprehensible 15 straight seconds of what the game actually looks like to play or any of the things you do in it besides Hit A Guy is not spoilers. It's not necessary for FFXIV trailers because everyone already knows how that game plays because it's been out for almost a decade.
            It's spoilers for him because he already said there will be characters who will be with the MC when he goes to different places. So what does that mean? If he shows a trailer with the protagonist with other people that makes it already a spoiler because people will have an idea what will happen on when and where.

That's enough of a spoiler for him.

Also I think you should know that the game was supposed to release this year but SE moved it back just for Forspoken.
There's always something a little uncanny valley-ish about FF games to me.
    Yeah, I feel like the character models look like a human version of an anime character. There's like an extra layer of translation between what actual people look like since it's going human>anime>model instead of just human>model.
        It feels almost Gamecubey to me? But obviously extremely modern and polished.

I think it's the lack of shadows/depth in character models that makes it feel almost like 3d modern characters but on a flat plane. I get the same thing with From Soft games though.
            Could it also be that their irises don't move completely like humans? If you look at [Cindy](https://youtu.be/8PMDFu9d83Y?t=446) in FFV15,  she has the big eye movements to change what she's looking at but not the little flicks (saccades) that actual people do. Compare for example [Kingsglaive](https://youtu.be/UblcNFVVHT8?t=51), and the fact that the pre-rendered cutscenes in FFXV do have them.

Their movements are also a little stiff outside of fighting, anytime they walk, run or gesture it's somewhat exaggerated. Although that might be intentional so it adds to the feeling of dynamism. 

Also the fact that their faces don't deform that much when they move. Compare [Ellie's facial expressions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-iZiuT0zPU) in The Last of Us Part II even in the still-posed Model Viewer, she has cheek creases and brow creases and her hair moves realistically.  

Actually compare Noctis and >!Sid!< from FFXV [in the same scene alone](https://youtu.be/8PMDFu9d83Y?t=467). >!Sid!<'s irises still don't move, but >!his!< whole face is full of wrinkles and creases that are moving and giving a lot of detail. In comparison, Noctis only moves his eyes, cheeks and lips a little, and no wrinkles in sight. Even more true for their hands, arms, tight-fitting clothing, etc..

(No shade by the way, just observations.)
    Because FF characters are really really really good looking.
Yeah I hope it doesn't turn out to be another Forspoken.
I was worried that they'd use the same kind of dialogue as FFXIV but it seems they've improved the awkward pacing issues and dropped the extreme Olde English accent, which is great to see.

Definitely need a gameplay showcase for sure.
    The elimination of said pacing issues could be due to FFXVI will be the first *Final Fantasy*-title to utilize English as its original language, along with how it was [confirmed last year that the voice actors will also be doing motion-capture for the game](https://www.siliconera.com/final-fantasy-xvi-will-feature-full-facial-mocap-using-english-voice-actors/). So the voice actors aren't just voicing, but seems to also be delivering their lines in a real-time fashion similar to how *Resident Evil VIII*, *Guardians of the Galaxy* and most other major cinematic games does their performances.
        Just as god intended
        > FFXVI will be the first Final Fantasy-title to utilize English as its original language

I didn't know that! That actually explains why the English voice acting is so good! I speak Japanese and always prefer Japanese for anime/games, but FF16 is the first time I've felt the English VA is better.

When the first trailer came out I was shocked by how good the English voice acting and lines were. I was even telling my friend they were so good that I felt like the lines had been written in English first then translated to Japanese afterwards, rather than the other way round that it is for every other game. I'm actually impressed with myself that I was able to tell lol
    Only one single character in XIV talks with the "extreme olde english" because he's a nerd who grew up spending more time with books than with others.
        Yeah, especially later on in the story Urianger is a a joy. They turned "generic scholar who speaks fancy" into "bookworm nerd who spends so much time studying old tomes that he cant speak properly, so everybody gives out and makes fun of him for it". One of my favourite characters.
            I'm glad they doubled down on him and Y'stola.  They're two if the better written characters in FF history.  They both start out generic, but you really get to know them as time goes on.  And tbh, they don't really change that much, you just understand why they're the way they are, which is amazing writing.  Less Flanderization, more depth.
                It's hard to single out most of the main party but I'd probably throw Thancred in there too. Starts off as the "cool playboy" type and really gets some fantastic depth by the end of Shadowbringers.
                    Special mention to Alphinaud throughout Heavensward. He was ablittle shit in A Realm Reborn, but he grew into a far more likeable person by the end. His growth as he became more humble was well done.
                        Hell Alisaie too. She went from being stuffed into a highly optional raid series to being her own character who stands apart from her brother.
                            Oh yes, getting to spend more time with her was one of the best parts of Stormblood.

But Alisale wasnt ablittle shit like her twin lol
                                It was honestly the highlight for me. I love both the twins now, they really balance each other out. It was great finally getting to know her. They're really playing the long-form format well, having minor characters reappear from years ago to become lead roles, >!and also having leading characters retire to side ones as they do their own things!< really makes the world feel alive and natural. Its the same reason One Piece feels like such a grand adventure.
                    From Playboy Thancred to Depressed Dadcred
                    The stuff with him and Ryne is so so fucking good. Maybe my absolute favorite moment in ShB is the scene with him in the graveyard though.
            Absolutely in my top 3 as well. Pretty well every scene he's in during later expansions is impeccably written and acted.
    FF14 has really good voice acting, but the flow can feel stilted because it (usually) allows you to pause between line deliveries due to it being an MMO and needing to give people a chance to step away from the keyboard.


The only character who routinely talks in olde English is Urianger, and it’s done as half comic relief and to heighten certain monologues.
        I think the reason why Urianger speaks in old English is because in the Japanese version he speaks very formally. To localize it, the team decided to make him speak in Shakespearean like English and it added charm to Urianger.
            [deleted]
                Dragon Quest does this, it actually tends to work pretty well.
                I know Xenoblade 2 used accents to highlight where a character came from. The Blades typically had an American accent (from metropolitan to valley girl to high school venacular), people from the more agriculturally focused Gormott had Welsh accents, or the people from Mor Ardain had Scottish accents. This feature sort of carried on in Xenoblade 3 (since it follows XC1 and 2).
                Final Fantasy IX had a great localisation IMO which used different accents etc (although obviously it's not voiced).
            Also back in 1.0 he has a pretty wild storyline that the olde English played into. Urianger recognized the obscure prophecy van Darnus was using as a road map for Project Meteor... so he traveled around reciting those exact prophecies to distract van Darnus so he(?)° didn't notice the Circle of Knowing working on stopping Project Meteor. It worked great, and it's a pity there are no callbacks to this in Garlean related content later on.

°English localization screwed up here, long story short in Japanese Nael was female from the start but her gender was never explicitly mentioned; you can do that in Japanese without it being suspicious like avoiding all gender references would be in English. Localizers assumed the enemy commander was male. That's why the dialogue in Coils is so bizarre; the localizers skip the *obvious* Samus reveal explanation for "him" being a woman and go for Bahamut changing Nael's gender for... reasons. This was later retconned further to a female relative stepping into the original Nael's armor after his death.

        Thanks for your reply, really interesting info! I did play XIV from about 1.16 all the way through to Stormblood but I didn't know a lot of this background info about the team.
I'd like to highlight the voice acting, since I'm quite a snob when it comes to VA. I speak Japanese and prefer Japanese dub over English 100% of the time; I cringe super hard at most English dubs. FF7R's English dubs are absolutely terrible to me for instance. But the English dub is extremely well done in FF16 based on the trailers.

Edit: After watching this trailer in both languages I think the English VA's have outdone the Japanese ones, and I've NEVER thought that about any anime/game before. If I want to be super nitpicky I think the Japanese version of the "It is *you* who will bow to *me*" line was executed better but the rest of the English VA is airtight.
    ha that's funny. I ended up really liking the English dub for FF7R. They all really grew on me, especially Barrett, Aerith, and Tifa.
    It's probably because of Koji Fox doing the localization. Most localization leads aren't as high up the chain as Koji is in Business Division 3 so he's afforded a bit more.
    I feel the same, the Japanese VA actually sounds a bit off somehow.
        Apparently the dialogue was written in English originally, so the Japanese VAs are using translated lines. They sound "off" for the same reason every English dub of anime sounds off, it's at least partially due to the translations. It all makes sense to me now lol
            16 is done by the same team as 14, and 14's localization is an interesting one. That one is done in Japanese first, but the English localization is so well-done that even a good chunk of Japanese players prefer it to the original Japanese. 14's JP script isn't bad, but it's kind of generic fantasy in some places; it's really more of a testament to just how beloved the EN localization is.

So now with 16, I believe it was reported that they did all the English voice work *first* and then translated it back into Japanese, with 14's much-beloved head of localization Michael-Christopher "Koji" Fox being the Localization Director for 16 as well.
Masayoshi mothafuckin Soken. This guy is a freaking genius. I really can't wait to hear what else he has in store for us when the game finally releases, cause for sure there are going to be some banger tracks.

[I mean just listen to this masterpiece!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tyuIh12_HU)

As for the gameplay, judging from the very few glimpses of combat we've seen I have faith in CBU3 in giving us a solid system.
    Why wouldn't you post his actual [masterpiece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6dTkAmpfI)?
        When you know which clip they're referring to before even clicking on the link...
        Do you know LA HEE? I sure do.
        I'm going to need some context here. That was....something else.
            Soken usually does a goofy performance during Fan Fests.

In 2016 he [played](https://youtu.be/KwKUnJ2yO7s) a dungeon theme using two instruments and then just kicking a cardboard box.
            FFXIV's third expansion, Shadowbringers, has a day time track called "Civilizations" for one of its six zones. Pretty much from day one when the expansion released the "LA HEE" got memed hard and still does to this day. The FFXIV team does fanfests every two years (usually used as a staging grounds to tease and announce the next expansion) where they do loads of stuff for and with the playerbase.

The clip you're confused about is from the fanfest 2021, which would have normally been three separate ones spread over the late fall 2020 to early spring 2021 in Japan, the US and Europe but due to the pandemic they streamed it. One of the sections was about several of the ingame tracks of the game, either played on piano, by the game's own band (THE PRIMALS) or by the man, Masayoshi Soken, himself like the video linked above. Basically a giant love letter to the community, showing that pretty much every part of the development team is in tune with the community.

At another part of the fanfest, the team did another homage to a meme where [members of the dev team danced to the live version of the "A Long Fall" track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6tEi-6BLsw) that plays [during one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NApxz5bSl20) of the [Shadowbringers dungeons.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9QD25nakt8) The different colors of the shirts stand for tank (blue), healer (green) and DPS (red) - representing a dungeon group.
            This is from the fan festival in 2021, where the devs put on a convention to celebrate the game. There's often a bunch of announcements, events, and as you see here, a concert. 2021 was fully remote due to COVID.

The singer, Soken, is the main composer of FFXIV and is very highly regarded. This was one of the songs in the concert, which was a cover of a [overworld theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ascfjJXDWjo). One of the lyrics in the theme is La Hee, which has become a meme in the FF community. 

So basically, this legend walks on stage with no preamble, goes "Do you know La Hee?" and starts to sing... that. It was hilarious.
            To add on to the rest of the context: 

Soken's always had a silly side where he's not afraid to go on stage and act the fool to put on some truly memorable performances, but this particular FanFest (where the above took place) he announced that he'd spent much of the pandemic secretly working from the hospital where he was being treated for cancer. He only told as many people as he had to in order to make the working arrangement possible and asked that they keep it secret from the rest of the development team, so that he could work as "normally" as possible. 

He went on to say that his cancer is completely in remission and that the thought of the fans enjoying his work got him through the experience. So in addition to his general silliness, I think there's a hefty dose of "I'm still alive to be able to do this!" thrown in there as well.
            It's Civilizations from the [Rak'Tika Greatwood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ascfjJXDWjo) zone in FFXIV, Soken wanted to perform it himself as he originally intended it.
    Shimamura and Hamauzu were good too but Soken really is the closest thing we've had to a replacement for Uematsu. Just incredible.
        The dude's range is absolutely bonkers. From bangers like [Under the Weight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WR1-pds8qM) to "this should be in every music to relax to playlist" like [Sultana Dreaming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG-BIMPtC9k) (Uldah Night Theme).
            I was fortunate enough to play FFXIV for many hours with a good friend.

Later, during a particularly difficult part of my life I rediscovered Sultana Dreaming, I absolutely broke down sobbing, it felt like home. Like being safe around good friends with peace in your heart.

Whenever I listen to it to this day I still am comforted in a way that is difficult to describe.
            or when he remixes an old song and does.. [amazing things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsX6nxwCZ1o)
        I'm gonna say it. For me, he's surpassed Uematsu. I'm more of a rock music kinda guy, so Soken starting from that as his square one means his tracks often just hit the tone better for me.
> but the snippets of regular gameplay have been brief and difficult to infer much from.

Agreed, but the regular combat did look pretty cool in that snippet.

And the combat controls actually looked more similar to FFXV than FFV7R to me, with magic that we have to wait to recharge after each use instead of just using MP.
XV had such an amazing ost
    Yoko Shimomura is fantastic
    Hellfire, Somnus Ultima, Wanderlust, Apocalypsis Noctis and its variants, Ignis main theme. Absolutely epic and amazing soundtracks
        No Valse di Fantastica?
            I was just listing off the top of my head!
Soken stop making making bangers challenge (impossible)
    IDK how he keeps releasing a new banger every single patch of FFXIV. Man is a machine
        Well that's because he's no longer the sole composer of the game and others joined over the time as well. Soken is fantastic, but other composers like Daiki Ishikawa and Takafumi Imamura deserves as much credit as Soken, too
            (Some minor spoilers for Endwalker below via song titles)

For those unaware, Ishikawa and Imamura were responsible for (or heavily involved in) creating such songs as: The Black Wolf Stalks Again, Your Answer, the Sharlayan daytime theme, the Ktisis Hyperborea theme, and the Endwalker dungeon boss theme, and several of the dynamis themes.

Soken probably still deserves the lion's share of credit for building FFXIV's musical identity, but his team are fantastic composers and arrangers in their own right.
                The remixes in Endwalker of other expansion songs were great at repurposing the vibes of the original songs with adding new character to them.  Really well done by those composers and the team.
        ff14 wasn't for me but that soundtrack is killer
        the two horsemen of bangers every patch: soken and yu peng chen

we need to find two more consistent sources of every patch a banger so we have the four horsemen though
Every Final Fantasy is a divisive one, but there's one thing each Final Fantasy fan agrees on - soundtrack is always masterpiece
    Yeah, even generally considered "not that great" entries like [15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xkv3HbHBdBI) and [13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKR5lSKeZxk) have amazing soundtracks
The music from all three trailers (but especially the second one) has just been epic. Soken is fantastic.
With Yoshi P at the helm, the Heavensward writing team, the Dragons Dogma/DMC5 Combat Director and Soken doing the music, I'm much more confident that it will be great.
    >With Yoshi P at the helm

Well Yoshida *isn't* at the helm, the director is Hiroshi Takai, whose probably most well known for [The Last Remnant...](https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/the-last-remnant)
        that's great to hear. The Last Remnant was probably the only singleplayer RPG they made where you felt like exploring an actual world with good fantasy elements and having an actual team at your side in the entire PS3 era of Square Enix
            The Last Remnant was a middling game that was severely weighed down by its confusing explanation (or lack thereof) regarding the combat and party systems that was perhaps a little *too* RNG and automated, because in the end you're only influencing the battle.

However, it's really unfortunate that people almost never give the world, races, art and music of The Last Remnant the time of day because of how under the radar it is. It's full of concepts that are so cool and a lot of them are executed very well... it's just actually playing the game where half of the time I'm scratching my head or beating it against a brick wall. I agree with you, and I am excited for FFXVI, but still..

Further pissed off that the Remastered version of the game looks graphically far superior and is a great remaster, but is locked to console at max 1080p (because it came out before PS4 Pro) with no patch, and they REMOVED the prexisting PC version from all digital storefronts with no announcement or hint whatsoever that we'll get a port of the remaster.
                I’ve had this game in my steam library for ages. Is this some kind underperforming inferior version? I know nothing about it other than buying it ages ago.
                    The PC version is perfectly fine, it runs very well and works right out of the box with controllers too (you may have to switch to controller control setting and max the graphics first). Funnily enough, it was considered probably the only good JRPG port on PC for years upon years despite the game itself not being hot.

The remastered version on console moves it to Unreal Engine 4 and honestly it's very impressive how much of UE4 they shoved into it without it looking like a rush job. And it also adds a super-sprint mode that lets you run in the overworld sections MUCH faster... that's it.
                The PC port doesn't really run at 4k either so you're not missing anything. I have both, the console versions have better lighting while the pc version has better framerates.
            Game was terrible, but had a cool world and ideas that were executed poorly.
        The Last Remnant was great, though
        Oh shit I loved last remnant. Nice
    Damn, talk about an all-star team. I had no idea.
        SQEX is pulling out all the stops by bringing out their Aces.
            They probably have to, in order to restore faith in the series after how FFXV was (understandably) received.
                I liked FFXV!

Bad Final Fantasy game but great camping with your buddies simulator.
                    Ffxv is a interesting “failure”. For like every part it does well there’s 3 parts that are poorly developed.

But I think it’s the best FF game to establish the party as a real group. As opposed to a band of characters joining together for a common goal. Like they really were friends and it was obvious.

The campfire scene in the end of the game I think is a payoff worthy of getting through some of the slog that is the game.

Great world, lore, just poorly connected and told. I would love for them to redo it one day the way properly.
                    I really like it too but they pretty blatantly gave up on the game/world halfway through their DLC plans. I think we ultimately got 4/7 character DLCs and one ok MP DLC. There's quite a bit of that story they deliberately left out.
                    FFXV flirting with magical realism for its world is infinitely more interesting to me than the drab fantasy world for FFXVI.  I don't fault anyone for liking it though and wanting a return to that type of setting given it's integral to the series' history.
                > after how FFXV was (understandably) received.

And FF13, and FF13-2, and FF13-3, and to some extent FF12.   
They really need to restore people faith in mainline non MMO Final Fantasy games.
            And keeping Nomura well the fuck away.

That gives me hope.
                Some of you act like Nomura killed your families.
                    In another timeline he might have!!
                        He kills your family in a random card battler side game off the main series
                            that ends up being pivotal to the plot for the next decade
                        I bet it was actually his nobody Romnuxa traveling between worldlines with the power of waking. Easy mistake to make
                        Underrated comment. Next thing you know, Donald and Goofy will show up!
                    My family died in the pouch and zipper wars so he did.
                    Nomura didn't kill my family, he just won't leave my damn house.
                >Game has nothing to do with Nomura, he's not even remotely involved

reddit: GRRR NOMURA
                    Nomura is writing the last 2 books of ASOIF? The delayed release makes so much sense now...
                Nomura has had some kind of creative input in nearly every single good thing that Square Enix has ever created.

Why the hate?
                    Nomura to me is like Zack Snyder, dude is really good at what made his name (Nomura a character designer, Snyder was a director of photography) but when they started to get director roles, that's when it got meh.

I think that the first 2 KH games are good, but that's it. Everything else that he was involved as a director is sub par, but when he gets to just design things, he does a good job.
                        kingdom hearts is really the only series he's directed, sans the f7 remake, but he wasn't responsible for the unpopular changes to its narrative despite people thinking it. even seems like most don't realize how much he contributed to the original

his work as producer/concept creator also extends to twewy and stranger of paradise, both of which are good!
                            TWEWY’s design is top notch
                        I don’t even think he’s a bad director per se, but he reminds me a bit of George Lucas where he needs someone to keep his ideas in check. I love KH1 and 2, along with the VII remake, and he’s not the primary writer on any of those. He’s got a good eye for visual flair, generally fun gameplay decisions and can come up with some interesting plot points, but he needs a good writer and producer to reign him in or it just goes off the rails and becomes too much.
    I already knew about those things, but I still get that certain Vince McMahon gif-like reading that every time lol. 

I mean, YoshiP and his team at FFXIV are literally the last bastion of FF-sanity over there at Square-Enix. That alone gets me interested in FFXVI.
        I wouldn't completely count out the FFVIIR team. Regardless of the story direction, there is a lot of good things with the remakes in terms of presentation, graphics, characters and gameplay.
            Oh I absolutely love how they handled combat and materia progression in that. Like Character swapping alone in general. After YEARS of struggling from Square Enix to get a mix of traditional FF and action combat right. All I could think was how some other action-JRPGS would have totally benefited from that concept alone (*freaking Xenoblade Chronicles!!!).*

But to it's degree, it's a Remake of something that came before and not something new and unique at the time. FFXIII, and especially FFXV could have been treated a hell of a lot better. So unfortunately it had to be a Remake to get people back on Square's Side...or it was fantastic story/world building of a MMO that got people like me to glance at single Player Final Fantasy once again. Hence why I'llstill state that Yoshi P and Creative Business Unit III seem to be last bastion of people that want Final Fantasy to be new and unique once again. But we'll see when FFXVI lands.
            I'm hoping they're learning from their mistakes. FF7R really was an enjoyable game that I could not put down. I usually don't finish most games I buy tbh.. So to me its a really good game. definitely can name flaws, but the pros definitely outweighed the cons.
                It feels to me that Square has tons of talented people out in their company, but has difficulty reigning them in and making them focus. I think sometimes it is a clash of creative egos (which happens a lot in creative spaces, music, film, animation, etc.), sometimes it is mismanagement by the guys in charge, lack of understanding of certain technologies (i.e. FFXIII), or sometimes it is having too grand of a focus that is difficult to translate to a game (i.e. KH3, FFXV/VSXIII). FFXIV was successful partially because Yoshi P and his team found that the 1.0 team, though talented lacked focus and that sometimes caused chaos.
            Square Enix has a ton of amazing talent they just have difficulty focusing it. Yoshi P's biggest achievement was focusing the talent of the FFXIV team so hopefully he can work his magic from the start here.
    Sounds like an all-star cast but this trailer having 50% of the time dedicated to introducing random countries and politics we aren't familiar with is giving me Triangle Strategy vibes.
    I'm still concerned. I feel the way xv failed most was it was a single player mmo. Bunch of hubs with repetitive quests to earn XP and rewards to allow you to progress. My father was murdered. My kingdom taken over and in ruins. That one soldier guy in the movie gave his everything in that fight like a badass. I'm collecting frogs and fishing and having some great photos on my fab-bro camping trip. 

So I hope the xiv team keeps it feeling like a jrpg rather than an MMO.
        The reason FFXV failed was because of everything happening in the background in development, there was no consistency and it was sort of a rush job. All things considered it's a miracle it turned out the way it did. This game does not have anywhere near the baggage
            Nowhere was it more apparent that it was a rush job than that town you go to for Leviathan. That town was *way* too developed for it to be a one-off quest area, it was clearly intended to be another town you could regularly visit, maybe even a second hub, but all of that was casted aside. 

Imagine what XV could have been like if it was led by the XVI team. The same graphics, the same exploration, the same combat system (which, honestly, is deeper than most people give credit for), but done in a way that doesn't just feel like a road trip with the bros. 

[I still think back to when XV was originally called XIII Versus.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6At_bb1PNU)
                Agree completely. The game was terrific until then. Terrible after
            Rush job? That bitch got started and restarted like a dozen times and took forever to actually come out. Don't forget XV started as part of a threesome of games that was supposed to be XIII
                Yes, and the last build was a rush job. That's what I meant by that.
        XII was the "singleplayer MMO". And now, especially with the Zodiac Age version, its pretty well-received.
            XII was ahead of its time in many ways.  The few tweaks with Zodiac Age keeps the game feeling extremely modern.  Like if you told me Zodiac Age on switch was a new game released last year, I would believe you.
            It was mixed amongst fans.  It wasn't bad per se, but it definitely wasn't everyone's cup of tea.
                Definitely mixed - it’s actually my personal favorite. Depends on who you ask
        FFXV failed for me because the combat was trash and the story required too many extra-curriculars.
            > and the story required too many extra-curriculars

To date, it's the only mainline FF that requires those extra-curriculars to comprehend the story in full. No other FF does this.
        I mean, FF14 isn't like that at all. Its story lives up to and eventually (Heavensward, Endwalker and especially Shadowbringers) even surpasses the peaks of single player FF. The common line is 14 is a traditional JRPG with a MMO tacked on to the endgame when you finish the story.
            Ahh how soon we forget the several hours of quests where you have to gather supplies to throw a party for yourself before you're allowed to fight Titan.

Like, 14 has narrative high points for sure. But its pacing is pretty wack by nature of it being an MMO and it is inarguably 'like that' as you put it.
                It's a little disingenuous to use their earliest content as the benchmark for CBU3 instead of the all recent stuff that they've won piles of awards for. There are of course obvious limitations to the gameplay and storytelling as a consequence of FFXIV being built on a decade old MMO, but the real meat of FFXIV's story succeeds on it's own merits. You could rip it all out of the MMO and build a (very long) singleplayer mainline title out of it with minimal adjustments (Mostly just getting rid of the filler quests), and it would still be phenomenal.
                    >You could rip it all out of the MMO and build a (very long) singleplayer mainline title out of it with minimal adjustments

People really underestimate how long the MSQ is. People regularly complain about JRPGs breaking the 40 hour mark, and that includes gameplay. FF14 is over 20 hours of cutscene time \*per expansion.\*

[https://www.reddit.com/user/Cyberfunk3/comments/y5gauf/ffxiv\_tracker\_62\_update\_improved\_formatting/](https://www.reddit.com/user/Cyberfunk3/comments/y5gauf/ffxiv_tracker_62_update_improved_formatting/)

A quick eyeballing of time says I 100%'d the Pixel Remasters of 1 through 4 (\~115 hours) in less time than it takes to watch cutscenes in FF14 (\~123 hours). That's watching the extended version of the LotR trilogy 10 times, and still leaving time for bathroom breaks! If you could play all of the MSQ cutscenes sequentially without having to do dungeons and walk places between them, you'd be able to put the controller/mouse down for \*five days.\*

This is tolerable when you're playing it as it comes out, but don't undersell how gargantuanly long the story is, or how much of an advantage the MMO format breaking up these story sections over literal years helps.
                        Yeah I recently created an alt and just finished the 2.0 content. Sure the story content itself is about 20 hours, and I'm honestly okay with that, but I broke it up with a *lot* of side content. I leveled all my crafters, did every blue quest I came across, and, in general, lollygagged around for days just enjoying myself. Play time came out to around 80 or 90 hours by the time I cleared Praetorium.

And it still felt like it went by in the blink of an eye. So when people say they "slogged" through ARR I just question how out of touch I must be with those players to have genuinely enjoyed myself so thoroughly for like 4-5x the length of time it probably took them to do it. Or maybe just enjoying the content on offer rather than forcing yourself to binge the MSQ is the key to having fun with it after all. Who knows? I definitely agree that people downplay how much the MMO aspect helps that long stretch of story *work*. The world wouldn't be as interesting without it. Your achievements wouldn't mean as much. A solo version of FFXIV wouldn't really be the same.
                            Well, for me 80 to 90 hours of playtime means about six months in real life, so the idea of levelling crafters (or BOT/MIN) without being able to fly or having a huge bank (i.e. spending a lot of time walking everywhere) is not that appealing to me. Different strokes for different folks, but I’m happy that I rushed the MSQ (some friends of mine just decided to buy the ARR quest skip instead) this time instead of bailing halfaway through because the downtime to meaningful content ratio was too high.

Persona 5 was for me a game that while long (first playthrough took me 120 hours spread throughout a year), stroke a good balance of having content interspersed with good fluff. So far post-ARR seems to be working out well enough for me, but I’m afraid it might be a couple of years until I actually get to Endwalker.
                    I picked the Titan thing because it's a particularly egregious example and I'm trying to go lighter on spoilers for newer content. But there are absolutely places in Shadowbringers and Endwalker where massive forward momentum for important characters and the plot in general screech to a wailing halt so that we can meet brand new people who don't matter and spent waaaaay too long, say, building robots in the desert with them instead of actually completing someone's story arc. 

Again, I'm not saying 14 is bad and I'm not saying it doesn't hit hard when things are firing on all cylinders. But to make the point that it doesn't feel like an MMO with a ton of filler quests in hubs to pad out the runtime is absurd.
                        They fixed this part in recent updates though I thought.
                            The specific thing I'm talking about in this post happens in Shadowbringers, so I doubt it. I know there was a pass at some point to cut down on some of the fluff in the really old content but I suspect they didn't get rid of all of it.
                                As someone who very recently finished ARR, it's still so slow and bloated (especially the patch quests) that it's almost hard to believe it used to be worse.
                        Yeah almost every major event is precluded by a lot of meaningless quests where you gather something or have to travel someplace to talk to someone else only to then fo back to the first place
                I haven't forgot it at all, trust me we FF14 fans remember it all too well lol (hell, the part in Return from Ivalice that's an ill-considered parody of the Titan questline was recently cut from the game because everyone hated that bit too).

But in a game that has spanned 9 years with 300+ hours of main story content and 100s of hours of side story content, the fact you're reaching for one of the earliest questlines in what is universally agreed to be the weakest part of the game that doesn't hold a candle to ShB and EW actually proves my point as much as anything.

And yeah I'm not claiming every single quest in that 300+ hours is a masterpiece, the pacing can be fairly slow at times and occasionally you can get quests that border on padding (level 88 Sharlayan...) but these moments pale in comparison to MSQ meaningfully pushing the story forward in some way or another.
                    I like how you say "we FF14 fans" like I'm not one of you. I didn't beat Endwalker because I hate the game or the story. But people come out of the woodwork to chop your head off if you imply anything is wrong with the plot.

You could cut *a lot* out of it and it'd be exactly the same or better. I knew I'd get a ton of people trying to *got you* me by pointing out my example is old, but it absolutely still happens. I just don't want to fill my post with Shadowbringers spoilers because unlike ARR it's actually genuinely great sometimes and I don't want to ruin that for anyone.
                It's not even good pacing for an MMO. FF14 just has an amazing story that you have to do completely mundane stuff to progress. It could almost be billed as a whole new type of interactive storytelling experience. That's not to say the mmo aspects of the game aren't good, but they're only present in the questing portion of the game when it forces you to group up which honestly just annoys me at that point because I'm vibing on the story even though group play is why I started.
                    This has been updated. They recently cut out many meaningless quests to make this part of the game more enjoyable.
                        I played through post-patch ARR recently, and while I wouldn't call many of the quests *meaningless* exactly, it's still wayyyyyy longer and slower than it needs to be, especially post-ARR/pre-Heavensward.
                        Yeah they cut some stuff but only so much that it went from absolutely absurd to slightly ridiculous.
                Which is from ARR, the worst part of FF14 and also not what he was referring to. He explicitly calls out 3 of the 4 expansions as being better stories. 

ARR needs to get a full revamp, it very much does not sell what kind of game the rest of the game is, which is a shame because it's most people's first taste.
            FFXIV is exactly like that. I played through arr and some of the bridge content before the first expansion. There were plenty of times I was doing grindy, repetitive stuff to level up so I could do the next main quest mission. It had more of a cohesive story than other mmo's, but it was very much still an MMO. And who can forget dungeon: the movie? I was grinding that for some cosmetic event with a friend and I swear we spent more time watching a movie than actually controlling our characters. 

And let's be honest, the story in arr wasn't really anything great. It was pretty standard stuff and predictable as hell. Compare that to other ff's and it just pales in complexity, character development, and originality. Maybe the expansions improved, but the core game was only a 7\10 at best for an RPG story. 

I could go on about what I think is the right and wrong way to do MMO stories, out what makes a good singlet player story vs MMO, but I won't.
                Are you of the impression that this is controversial? ARR is a solid "Ok.". It really is nothing more. 

Get through Shadowbringers and Endwalker, and I have now played the best story, characters both friends and villains, soundtrack and writing in all of FF. Possibly my favorite in all gaming.
                ARR is barely even the prologue of the game. FF14 dramatically changes in quality from Heavensward on. It's not considered the best mmorpg for nothing.
                Literally nobody talking about how good FF14 is refers to ARR. The guy literally said Heavensward, Endwalker and Shadowbringers.
                You played the worst bits of the game and didn't touch any of the actual stuff that FFXIV won a shit ton of awards for. Everyone agrees that there are a lot of low points in the game, but the highs are well up there, enough to make FFXIV in the top 3 of FF, even the best for many people.
                    The worst bits of the game comprise the entire first 50-ish hours of mandatory content. I like FFXIV but I really can't blame anyone for dropping out during or right after ARR because it's boring, long, and mandatory. It's an extremely valid criticism of the game.
                I don't think many FFXIV will disagree with you that ARR's story was okay at best. However Heavensward, Shadowbringers and Endwalker are definiately what people will think of when they talk about FFXIV's amazing story. I'll say that FFXIV has hit a groove in 'how' they tell the story, but this 'how' isn't really for everyone.
                ARR is not what people talk about when they describe FFXIV as a really good story. And the game is nine years old and has very much learned from it's early iteration.
        I didn’t get that vibe from XV at all, it felt like a regular open world game - I think XV fucked up by releasing too early and splitting the story across 1000 mediums. I played Royal and loved it - but from what I’ve read the story is even MORE jumbled in the original and it was really disjointed feeling.
            I just plain stopped in the original.  Didn't remember a single thing that happened one day, had no attachment to a single character.  I just had no idea why I was playing.  I replayed the Royal and it definitely clicked more... that being said, I'm still not much of a fan.  The combat was super lacking, and the story needed a ton of editing.  And the game movement just took forever.  I got tired every time I hit a new zone.
        XV didn’t really fail as a whole. It sold really well and the general consensus is everything before the linear last 25% of the game was great. I remember me and a friend feeling like it was one of the best FFs we ever played…and then the linear ending happened.
            XV didn't fail but it probably did lasting damage to the brand being the second mediocre Final Fantasy after XIII (with XIV 1.0 wreaking havoc in the background where the single player fans couldn't see). It still had the "Versus XIII was the real game" hype behind it at release which was hype that started in a time when there was more reverence for the Final Fantasy franchise. XVI is the first one that has to deal with the consequences of XIII and XV's mixed reception.
                For the hard-core fans probably, but people don't like to admit that FF is a very broad appeal franchise, with the majority being casual fans.  It's the most mainstream JRPG by a wide margin.  Each mainline game just needs cutting edge graphics, and it'll sell like hotcakes
            The linear ending was annoying gameplay wise, especially not knowing you’d be stuck there till it’s over, but story-wise it really kicked the shit out of me lol

Though it’s nice they let you go back for endgame
        I was pretty hyped for the game after seeing the movie. You roll out into the open world in the car, go up to a gas station, and get a quest to go find beans.

Talk about disappointing.
            Seems pretty standard for the start of any RPG, can't be taking down bosses the size of gods asscrack right out of the gate, you gotta be collecting 10 bear asses and giving some herbs you found on the floor to old lady dithers to treat her back pain.
        Well good thing not even FFXIV is designed like that. And Yoshi-P has commented multiple times that FFXVI is like a fast paced roller coaster so that seems to go against what you are describing.
        I wouldn't worry about it. FFXIV team have mastered the craft of making an MMO feel like a jrpg rather than an MMO (complete with a full npc party system and basically a traditional JRPG structure to its story) so I'm sure they are fully aware that this game shouldn't just be FFXIV offline. With each new expansion the game felt less and less like an MMO with jrpg elements and more and more like a JRPG with mmo elements (in a good way) so I don't think they'll fall into that trap. 

FFXV also had huge development issues, the game was essentially developed in 2 years so they had to resort to MMO style quests to fill gaps. Same kind of situation as Dragon Age Inquisition's content.
    *Dragons Dogma/DMC5 Combat Director*

REAL SHIT???
    >With Yoshi P at the helm, the Heavensward writing team

I definitely got a lot of FFXIV vibes from the trailer and that now makes sense, I knew YoshiP was working on this but not the Heavensward writing team.
I'm one o the Sickos who love FFXV (just began my, like, fourth playthrough) but XVI looks *special.*
    That's nothing. I'm a huge fan of XIII. Truly sick
        There are dozens of us! DOZENS!
    There was just so much *heart* in FFXV that it excused pretty much every obvious shortcoming the game had for me and easily became one of my favorite FFs. It's a broken game but damn is it memorable. 

I'm keeping a close eye on Forspoken too because it's the same team, even though I fully expect the same kind of criticism to come up at release
        >I'm keeping a close eye on Forspoken too because it's the same team

Tabata made XV what it was. Forspoken is helmed by some western Hollywood-type writers, so I wouldn't expect the same.
    Same. Feel-wise, FF15 might even be my favorite FF game. Yes the other games might have better combat systems you like, and most are finished and not rushed at the last half, but no other Final Fantasy game had made me feel sad about "no more adventures with my party" when the credits rolled. What FF15 did so much better than literally any other party-based RPG I've played (and I've been playing since NES) really makes you feel the bond between the party members. In many of the games your party is a group based on opportunity, you all have the same goal or similar direction of goals. But in FF15, you're a group of friends and they really nailed it.
        Man, I didn’t even know there was FF15 hate. That’s definitely my favorite FF game, personally. I loved the combat, characters, and settings so much. The story was whatever, but most FF games in the last 20 years have been that way. Doesn’t detract from how much fun that game was for me, though.
            i knew there was a decent amount of hate, but i think its mostly just cause its so different of a game from the classic FFs. doesnt appeal to the same type of person i guess
                The release hate was justified. The most complete edition (Royal edition I think?) adds so much content and extra context that I would say the game deserved a re-review. The base game was missing so much.
                >doesnt appeal to the same type of person i guess

Nah its more it just wasn't fleshed out enough, there brilliance under the surface but the game just skips past it.

For example a big moment should have been Ignis going blind, yet the how is completely skipped over devaluing the drama that comes from it.

XV is decent, better than some others in the series, but the development hell it went through absolutely marred the final product in a big way.
                In my experience the hate isn't due to any inherent negative with the gameplay, characters, or story. It's that they put the story out in a movie, anime, and other random places rather than in-game. Then rushed through the in-game story. Then to top it all off, canceled half the DLC which would have completed the story.
    I beat XV when it was released. Now that I have the upgraded PS+ and I saw that it has the Royal Edition I have been thinking about picking it back up. I've heard Chapter 13 is a bit different than when I played it last.
        It is, and there's an option to play a shorter versio - it's moreso you switching every now and then from playing as Noct to playing as The Bros.
    Boy band simulator XV is not a good game but it is fun to play. The atmosphere is just enjoyable.
    Reddit is being it's usual contrarian self with regards to 15.  It had the most promise and intrigue of an FF since the golden PS1 era.  It had a very troubled development.  Nomura was trying to make the ultimate Final Fantasy.

And I don't want to be negative but everything so far 16 looks very basic.  Western kingdoms warfare with Kings/politicians and very generic character design (Nomura gets too much hate, but atleast his characters at this point in time are very iconic, and stand the test of time), combat built upon the backs of 15 and FF7R.  

In the end people can say what they want about it but 15 had *heart*.
dunno, mate. gonna be hard to top the masterpiece that is Stranger of Paradise.
    You're probably joking, but SoP is likely my favourite game of 2022 so far. Even the story is great and later explains why Jack acts the way he acts. I always wonder if people who shit on it actually gave it a fair chance!
        Honestly even if the story is dumb like most people say, I think it looks fun. Just waiting for the steam release in another year or whatever.
            It's dumb in kind of a smart way (well, at least they try to make it so).   

There is a reason character interactions in the beginning are so weird and outlandish.
        tbh i don't think i'm even joking, mate. i tried the critically acclaimed ff14 and found it to be more a visual novel than a video game as the quests were atrocious and the early dungeons were in exercise in pressing 2-3 buttons on repeat. and all the good content seems to be an expansion or two in but i'm also told the story is a big part of the game and how i shouldn't skip it and i do not have the patience for any of it. 

but stranger of paradise? that is a video game, with gameplay, and it's fun in it's opening hours. a winner in my book.
    I want a DLC for FFXVI where Jack appears and he Jacks all over everyone.
    Hope we get a good sale for the holidays so I can finally play that gem.
    True GOTY, the morbius of video games
    Someone in the trailer says something about chaos, so I'm gonna go ahead and assume this is a direct sequel to SOP.
    Chaos.
FFXV could have been a lot more enjoyable with a better combat system. I really didn't like combat in thst game.
This may be a weird place to ask but are there any games that play like Kingdom Hearts 2? The combat was so good and I feel like a lot of games haven’t jumped on it’s train. 

FFVII Remake was the closest I’ve seen. I feel like XV was trying but everything felt so sluggish and heavy with the slower animations and bad framerate on console
The mainline FF games usually feel like they’re made by people who are still trying to figure out what being a “Final Fantasy” game even means.

The FFXIV creative leads (who are making this one) don’t have that problem. They have a confidence and surehandedness of vision that everyone else at Square Enix lacks.

The tough thing about FFXIV is that it’s an MMO and not everyone is into that. But FF16 looks like it’s going to be FFXIV storytelling with more accessible action/RPG game systems, which is a really good recipe for success.
See now I thought the VA from the beginning might have been Ralph Ineson, the actor (The Dad in The VVitch, and Dagme4 in GoT). It wouldn't be the first time CBU3 got an English actor from GoT to voice act in one of their games.
    Oh, you are absolutely right; Ralph Ineson is also a good possibility. And yeah, the developers CBU3 having at least one *Game of Thrones*-actor per game is pretty much tradition at this point. The actors of Roose Bolton, Gendry, Aerys Targaryen, Yara Greyjoy among others have voiced in FFXIV. Maybe I need to also start watching *Bridgerton* to find if their actors are involved in FFXVI, considering the character Anthony played by Jonathan Bailey is also voicing in FFXIV.
        I don't know if it's SIDE or CBU3's English localisation director doing the casting and directing, but they've managed to strike absolute gold with most of the voices, which is amazing since a lot of the best performances are from actors without many credits to their name. Rene Zagger as Emet-Selch and Matt Stokoe as Elidibus give unparalleled performances.
    100% Ralph. Bloody good rep
    Thank you! I was trying to figure out why I recognized that voice! I saw The Witch a couple weeks ago. And I knew the voice in this trailer sounded familiar!
    I had no interest in this game but if it is Ralph Ineson I might actually check it out.  I love just hearing that man talk dramatically.

Also near the end I think I heard another actor that I really enjoy his voice
I was thinking the gravely voice is Ralph Ineson from The Witch
    Finchy!
    Finchy! Bloody good rep.
Side isn’t an agency but instead a studio. Others in the U.K. include Liquid Violet (Souls games), Pitstop (Total War) and OMUK (I don’t remember lol) plus others. There are far more agencies and they get the auditions from these studios that are then distributed through their rosters for the casting directors at whatever studio to look through and decide on. Actors can also be on the books directly for these studios and get the auditions without an agent middleman but that’s decidedly rare here in the U.K.

Certain studios only collaborate with certain agencies too; I’ve had plenty of auditions from Pitstop and OM but none from Side or LV. There’s a bit of an agency hierarchy in London lol.
Heavensward in general could be described as "The FFXIV writers discover Game of Thrones" and this is written by the same writers. And it's M rated, so they can actually show some gore.
    Honestly I like the sound of that. There’s been several fantasy JRPG’s (including the last FF) that I’ve tried to pick up that I felt could have been amazing with a bit more grounding like you would see in some western media. I think Japanese fantasy is often better at embracing the truly fantastical and feel like you’re really seeing another world with different rules, but sometimes at the cost of feeling like you could live there and that everything doesn’t have to be quite so… Shakespearian maybe? The world and magic can be over the top without the characters being quite so artificial and theatrical I guess, which has been a problem with FF and why I just can’t seem to connect with the FF7 remake in the same way as the original despite loving the gameplay. On the other hand I think western stuff can get way to bogged down in the wrong details and can be too focused on being “gritty” and “realistic” to its detriment. I think both sides have their own strengths that set them apart, but I also feel that both could learn from each other in regards to their weaknesses. More than anything I’ve just wanted to see more fiction that meets somewhere in the middle.
    Even in 1.0 and ARR you could see the GoT/ASOIAF influence.
I don’t think it was happening this year at all. They clearly don’t want to step on GoW’s toes and Naughty Dog has already said they’ll have something to show in 2023 about Factions. All signs point toward early 2023
    2(?) trailers and very little gameplay. I think we'd be lucky for late 2023.
        Well they’ve said they are launching 2 unannounced live service games before the end of the fiscal year which is in March/April I believe. So they’re going to have to show them eventually along with their next slate of games. I believe God of War is the last game from their initial showcase for when they announced the ps5. They’ve seen to do announcements in waves and wait until all those games are out or almost out to announce the next phase.
> I’m 95% sure that the rumor that a PlayStation showcase was totally delayed/canceled because of the Activision M&A was right at this point

This rumor sounds so fucking stupid that it exists to fuel idiots that are invested in idiotic console wars on Twitter.  Playstation just simply didn't plan to do a big showcase this year period, there was no they would cancel one over the CMA, just cause of the deals they would had with third parties alone in regards to marketing.
    I don't know if that's the reason, by there wss 100% going to be an event in october. Silent Hill 2, FF XVI trailer being announced the same day there were leaks for a trailer of Spiderman 2. Too many coincidences related to Playstation.
    The entire gaming industry is fueled by so much pettiness that I can 100% believe that this is exactly what happened.

Or did we all forget that grueling phase in 2020 where both Microsoft and Sony basically tried to tiptoe around the prices of their consoles until literally 1-2 months before launch, waiting for the other company to reveal their price first?
Game is going to be a total flop because it looks nothing like Tactics Advance

Doesn't even run on the GBA at all smh
    Well the world does seem to have some Ivalician vibes... I can't even remember if the Ivalice in FFTA was the real one or not though.
        The art director for XVI, Hiroshi Minagawa, essentially created the look of Ivalice alongside Yasumi Matsuno. Minagawa was art director on FF Tactics and Vagrant Story, Co-director on FFXII.  There's a ton of Ivalice staff at CBU3 working on FFXVI, but he's arguably the biggest
That much is inevitable when FF has 20 different interpretations of what it is. Can't please them all.
Will be a day 1 for me as well, regardless of if the game is “good” or “bad” because sometimes I just simply like pretty things to look at 😂
    It’s a day 1 for me because I'm a Final Fantasy whore
        Yeah I probably should have led with this as well lol
        This is the most apt description of me lmao. It’s insane how strongly this franchise is still kicking all these years later.
        I preordered Final Fantasy Explorers back in the day, AMA
            Same. I even own the Collectors Edition of World of Final Fantasy.
        Not to mention a Soken whore. I really want to see what the mad genius (and he is) can do with this canvas.
It'll be a Day-1 and maybe a Collector's edition purchase if early previews turn out great. I have faith in YoshiP and his team to at least deliver us a captivating narrative experience if some of the FF-traditionalisms (combat, lack of party building) are lacking/omitted from it. 

I just want to be excited for a new single player Final Fantasy game like I was a teen. So I hope it delivers.
This is one of the few times I actually prefer the English VA over the Japanese VA from a Japanese game studio. 

It's insane how good the English VA is.
    Pretty sure the English VA was done before the JP VA. So the OG language is English this time.
        It makes with the mouth animations lining up so well, and it just sounds like it was written in English rather than translated
Odd, the OP required me to sign into YT to view it but this one didn't. So thanks for the mirror! 😁
Here in Japan it’s normal to have a department name with number on them. (Sales Unit 1, Dev Unit 2). It holds no meaning, so arbitrary, changes every year, yet Square-Enix managed to turn it into a brand, I’m astonished.
It's kinda hilarious especially with how consistently competent they've been on FFXIV.
I'm guessing they stuck with the name because SE and especially XIV fans who paid very close attention to the internal structure of SE were openly calling that division by their internal name for the better part of about 3-4 years prior to the reveal of XVI, since that division did not have a public name until that reveal.

Before they were CBU3, they were Business Division 5, until SE's internal restructuring happened in... I think it was 2019, when they got renamed into CBU3. Rumors of XVI being developed by BD5/CBU3 began as far back as late 2016 with job recruitment postings and people disappearing from XIV credits post-Heavensward, with people referring to the dev team by those names even from that far back.

It's actually pretty frightening that people accurately figured out exactly which staff was actually working on XVI a whole 1-2 years before it was actually revealed, just by looking at XIV credits, job postings for the division, and interviews posted on SE's recruitment page. For example, we knew Ryota Suzuki was the lead combat developer for XVI and that it would be an action RPG about 8 months prior to the actual reveal for the game, because of an interview saying he had been hired by SE for an undisclosed game at the time.

They probably figured that since people loved them enough to keep such close track of their internal affairs, they may have decided to openly call themselves in public by their internal name as a sign of pure confidence.
The name makes more sense when you consider it’s just a subdivision of Square Enix and not an actual independent game development company.
Has that been confirmed? I feel like I’ve seen rumors both ways.
    I feel its fairly safe to say it won't be a day 1 release at this point. Silent Hill 2 just got announced for both PC and PS 5 and that was on day 1 of that games announcement. 

Unless they got some special contract with Square I think its safe to say this will be an exclusive for some time.
        The first trailer, during a [State of Play 2 years ago](https://youtu.be/tjji8NEW9lo?t=296), said that it will also be available on PC, but the [standalone trailer](https://youtu.be/CUY9beBLIKM?t=221) just says PS5. The last trailer and this one don't mention platforms at all. A simultaneous PC release is not guaranteed, but it's not completely out of the cards either.
            As I understand it, this was a error and they've stated FFXVI will not be releasing on PC, at least not on day 1.
        Probably going to be 1 year PS5 exclusive then 1 year Epic Games Store exclusive.
and that kind of thinking is exactly why they will try to be more exclusive with releases.
    But Final Fantasy isn't a Sony product, it is released by Square Enix.
And with this unfortunately goes away all my will to play it... 

Being on gaming discords, final fantasy subreddits, ffxiv ingame, and various other forums and media, it will be impossible to avoid spoilers for years till it comes to PC. Even more if they sell their soul to epic once again as square is wont to do.
    Yup, I've given up playing FFVII Remake since they refuse to release it on Xbox. I don't have a PC powerful enough for modern gaming.
I wish Japanese publishers would move on from console exclusives already. It really sucks having to buy something I know will become a useless paperweight as soon as I'm done with the one game I wanted. This game looks great and I probably will end up caving but 60fps and below is so hard to go back to...
    They're developing a game that costs dozens (if not hundreds) of millions to make. When Sony comes knocking with a fat pay check that's probably worth dozens of millions Square Enix are never going to say no. [Same thing happened with Nintendo and Capcom for Monster Hunter Rise timed exclusivity.](https://old.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/kdmopd/nintendo_paid_around_6_million_for_monster_hunter/) And Microsoft do that too of course with Gamepass and other exclusive titles. 

We're never going to get out of this as long as the big 3 are willing to put so much money on the table for exclusivity, it's too good to pass up on it for studios. But Square Enix are by far the worst ones when it comes to that, they'll take the console exclusivity money, then they take the EGS PC exclusivity too.
    Even without any exclusivity deal a PC port would likely arrive later. For quite a lot of Japanese games and developers the focus and priority is console, for me personally this is one of the reasons why I tend to prefer console when it comes to gaming.
        Yeah. PC market in Japan is non-existent. Heck, even Playstation and Xbox are on the mud. Only console fourishing there is the switch because of its portability. And mobiles.
That's what I am seeing - just seems like another Devil May Cry/Bayonetta kind of cinematic hack and slash.
    >just

you say that like we get more than one good DMC/Bayo every couple years. High quality spectacle fighters are few and far between, while high quality JRPGs are fairly common.

I get that it's not what people come to Final Fantasy for, but as a fan of both genres I'd gladly take one in the underserved genre if it actually turns out well.
    The lead combat designer here was poached from Capcom after working on DMCV. It *is* a DMC fighter.
12's remaster is good on all platforms i've played it on (switch and pc)
The port quality is so extremely bipolar for FF. It's seems like the FF 15 port is decent but then FF7R has barely any options and bad stutters despite being UE4, and with the older 2D games it's a toss-up of shitty pc port of mobile port or the newer pixel ports that look better but have other issues. FF9 and FF10 seemed fine to me but then apparently 13 runs like shit. It seems to really depend on the mood squeenix is in and the alignment of the stars lmao
No obvious party gameplay is one of the main complaints people have had about FF16
    Guess I've missed those, they are nowhere to be seen around the visible part of the reddit comment section.
        A lot of conversation about it happens over at r/JRPG and r/FinalFantasy.
I agree about having a party. But I'm playing through FFXIII and it has a big focus on the party. Everyone seems very well balanced, story wise and gameplay wise. Your party is split for large portion of the game and you have to play as all of them for some time at least. There are other issues with the game but I like the balanced party. It feels like a group of people handling things together, rather than everything revolving around one person.

Now the stories of a couple of the party members may not be as interesting, but that is a different issue I think.
It doesn't negate my excitement but it is the thing that I hate bout the new direction of these games.  I liked having more direct control of my whole party.  FF7R was probably the best implementation so far but if I need to focus on one party member I like controlling the mage and the way aggro worked made it impossible to stay on Aerith for any reasonable amount of time.

Overall still excited for this game and will likely be getting but yeah... it's something that definitely bothers me.
I have to disagree about 15, even tho it had some solo segments, I felt that the entire game revolved around the party, heck eqch of them recieved a solo dlc to expand their story and character depth.
    I didn't mean story wise, I mean combat wise. I couldn't even tell how much of my damage and/or control was coming from the party, it seemed like I was doing most of the work and the rest were floating around waiting for a special double team combo, which made them a glorified weapon rather than a party member. I played the game for about 20 hours before moving on to something actually exciting to play.
I feel exactly the same way. Yakuza 7 is the game that made me realise this. With it's change from action to turn-based I saw what was gain; a true sense of camaraderie between the team. They felt all involved, and working together. Which in turn made their characters feel much more fleshed out and important. The characters, and the sense of there being a true team, is what really defines Final Fantasy to me.
It's something I sorely miss too. I'm sure this will still be a great game, but a party is a key part of scratching that FF itch for me.
    I'm just kinda tired of the multiple-warring-countries in the background trope.  Feels way overused by now, and not just in Final Fantasys.
        Then in the end you find out all the events were manipulated by Badasss Badguy Sadchildhood, who summoned the God of Whatever, so the politics didn't even really matter.
This game looks great and I plan on getting it, but I feel like it shouldn't be called Final Fantasy. So far it looks like a straight up action game with no party members and Devil May Cry combat.
Honestly, I'm having trouble getting into and latching onto any of the characters from these trailers at all. It kind of feels like a generic JRPG story. I'm sure that would change once playing it, especially since everyone is hyping up the team behind it, but right now it doesn't grab me at all.
Its disappointing, but not that big of a deal to me. I'll get my fill of that again with FF7R part 2
Yea... Summer 2024 probably, rip.
Honestly it can go either way. Square Enix just hosted a stream last month where they essentially advertised Steam to the Japanese market.
Don't worry, its Square's MO to sell exclusivity to Sony and once that expires they go to Epic and ask for more money.
Really? Looked extremely generic. No distinct art style, the most basic of JRPG setups (bunch of medieval era kingdoms going at each other), moody rote dialogue, uninspired character designs, disappointing music that fades into the background (yes, Soken is amazing but there wasn't anything here that stood out to me). There wasn't really anything about this that made me go OMG FINAL FANTASY! If they didn't bust out the summons related aspects I'd have no idea it was an FF game.

This is what a Final Fantasy trailer can look & sound like:

https://youtu.be/y8gJe_7xQKc

Really gets your imagination going for whats to come and show's Square's creativity on full display.
    Only thing I get from that trailer is that there is a protag, there is a rival, there is a romantic interest and there is an antagonist. And there are magic and mechas. I have not played VIII so that's as close as you get for a 1st impression.
    What's the difference between a shitty $1 fast food burger, and a gourmet burger from a Michelin starred restaurant?
    [removed]
    okay so. I'm not disagreeing with you about the 16 trailer.  It didn't give much to really dig into beyond "new Final Fantasy, with good visuals, and good music, and good voice acting" which is all stuff we'd already gotten from previous trailers. Some minor world-building but nothing that really excites.

However your counterexample is kinda... bad? Like I watch that trailer and I don't really get anything. I recognize some things because I already know about FF8, but if I didn't then... there's two guys with swords, and there's a girl, and there's a big robot. I think motorcycles? And the music is pretty generic. If you're going to go with a bunch of disorienting quick flashes for your whole trailer they need to be things that leave me mouth open, reeling at the possibilities or the magnitude of what I've just seen. Works well for horror, or for things that have really out-there environments or character designs. Or bringing back a bunch of things I already know (preferably in new and changed ways). Basically it needs to do better than two guys, a girl, some motorcycles, and a bunch of feather transitions. That gives me nothing, except maybe that it looked really good at the time in which case hey we're back at the 16 trailer again.
Final Fantasy has always had that top layer of different nations and politics. It has nothing to do with Game of Thrones.
No i feel the same way. The story and characters are not grabbing me at all. Not saying it needs anime spiky hair and zippers, but nothing about this feels exceptional or different from any other "serious" jrpg setting.

I'm sure playing the actual game would change that, especially knowing the team behind it, but the trailers just arent interesting to me.

There's been a good amount of sci-fi fantasy in ff for a good while now, it's nice to have an old fashioned classic one.  I personally prefer high fantasy like this and 13/15 being modern/future settings I'm glad they threw us a bone.  Plus you guys have FF7R.
There is a ton of FFXII and Ivalice staff working on this game, including a co-director of XII who is now the art director of XVI, Hiroshi Minagawa
I have to agree. As someone who thinks the gaming community *vastly* overrates the story of FFXIV, I am worried about this one. For all their faults, FFXV and FFXIII at least tried to tell unique & compelling stories - I get no sense of that at all here. It looks like someone made a fighting game out of the FF summons.
    Lol I’d probably prefer a fighting game with final fantasy summons over what’s been shown
It's definitely the most toned down FF style-wise, in line with FF Tactics I'd say. But Yoshida's character art for Tactics is really memorable.
Same impression here. This feels like a lot of recycled concepts from XIV. I wish they'd strayed further and tried to do something new without any ties to crystals or Eikons or even having pastiches of the powers in Eorzea.
It's always remarkable what people come up with to feel disappointed in something.
    I mean the defining trait of Final Fantasy from a marketing perspective as far back as the SNES days has been character design that permanently sears itself into your brain on first look. Every game from VI to XV (with the exceptions of XI and XII) have had at least one character that has become a pop cultural figure beyond the realm of video games from sheer strength of design alone. And the OP is right that these character design are taking cues from XII.
        I don't think we know confirmed details for the developers/designers for a lot of this game yet but Akihiko Yoshida (FF12 character designer) was the main character designer of the 3rd FFXIV expansion and along with Matsuno has been collaborating with YoshiP a lot recently.

He very well could be the character designer of FF16. There are of course rumors Matsuno is involved in the game too.
        > And the OP is right that these character design are taking cues from XII.

And what's the problem with that? Are you saying the character designs in 12 are generic? Lol

Not enough Bishonen kpop guys I guess.
    It's always remarkable how people like to brush off someones genuine skepticism as just them making something up to be disappointed about.
    It's valid criticism though. What's the issue with people having different opinions on the game?
I’ve actually gotten the same feeling. They all have the vibe of either PCs in 14 or the generic NPCs. No one has really popped.
Two women thank you very much.
I miss having so many different female characters in Final Fantasy. It was a huge part of what made me a fan in the first place.
almost 700 comments and there are like 2 of them mentioning the stark lack of women present in any capacity. women leaders: seemingly 0. women characters with voiced lines: 1 very briefly at the very end. 

No women appear at all until halfway through the trailer and the first is naked, silent, and behind a man. the next one is bound and kicked to the ground by a man and is silent. the next is a scantily-clad enemy. Finally there's a wordless scream and a single line. No other women present past those very short examples in the 4.5 minute trailer.

I had played every FF until 15, and part of why I didn't play 15 is the lack of women rep. I had really hoped that would be a one-off and 16 would be better, but this is creating a lot of doubt for me.
    The one bound has been in previous trailers wielding a rapier. She is the adopted sister of the main character. The chick in bed is the 2nd in command of the evil nation and one of the eikon warriors. J get the feeling she will swap sides after falling for one of the good guys in the story.
    Yep it is very glaring when you notice it. Got some whiplash going from FF V, VI, VII, XIII.... then dropping into XV. I've only played like 5 of the 13 total Kingdom Hearts games, but I feel like it suffers from the same. Of the few main gals only Kairi mattered and she was relegated to being a damsel.
[deleted]
    Yeah ff13 was like released 13 years ago. 15 starred 4 identical dudes and the first thing we saw in this trailer was that again. Followed by 5 or so male monarchs. So yes, these days, looks like it's just all men.
        Not true, look at FFXIV, the 3 main starting cities are all led by women, the group you are part of was led by a women too and in the group there were an equal-ish split of women and men. It changes over time but the pint still stands. 

As for FFXVI, because of the medieval setting it probably makes a lot more sense to have a male dominated cast but we've yet to play the game so we'll see.
It looks like we are not getting it day 1 on steam anyway.
    And not day 365 either, since Square is going Epic first when porting stuff to PC nowadays.

Day 730 it is.
        [deleted]
        That actually seems to be changing, slightly - Triangle Strategy and FF7: Crisis Core are both releasing to Steam day-and-date with the Epic version.
XVI is part of a lineage that started with Ogre Battle, Tactics Ogre, Final Fantasy Tactics, Vagrant Story, and FFXII. Many key team members (most notably Minagawa and Maehiro) worked on one or more of those games and were inspired by Yasumi Matsuno's storytelling and world building. The Ogre series predates the publishing of the Game of Thrones book.

They are similar in that they are medieval fantasy, but Yasumi Matsuno's work came first.
I just don't see what everyone else is seeing besides the pedigree behind the scenes. I'm sure the actual game will be good, but I can't get attached to the setting or characters at all. This looks no different than all the other gritty medieval fantasy JRPGs we've been seeing recently.
    >This looks no different than all the other gritty medieval fantasy JRPGs we've been seeing recently.



Give me a couple of examples that have similar level of fidelity. Would genuinely love to check those out.
        > fidelity

Well now we're talking about 2 different things. I'm talking about art direction, story, and characters. I'm sure in terms of "quality" it's miles ahead of anything else. It's SE's flagship JRPG after all.
            Sure, but are those other JRPG at least 3D? Fidelity is part of art direction, Triangle Strategy and GoT might be similar thematically, but still feel very different to me.

I was just wondering if there are games that look close to XVI, because it appeals to me a lot.
> I also can’t escape the feeling that this game was developed while Game of Thrones was still the hottest IP in media history

It kind of still is. House of the Dragon is kind of as popular as GoT was

Also the gritty dark fantasy is present in other very popular stuff like Attack on Titan or Arcane for example.
> tonally and graphically it just seems very flat.

Weird you say that being a FFXIV fan, since it probably takes aesthetic inspiration from there (and XII) more than any other FF.
Yeah, unpopular opinion but I love the Nomura settings so much, even if the gameplay/mechanics are questionable sometimes. I can’t tell you how much I want another game in a pseudo-modern fantasy sci-fi setting like 13 or 15 again

Edit: not to say this game doesn’t look good. I’d probably give it a shot if it came to PC but it looks like I’m waiting till 2024 lol
    In the context of the series I'm glad to see a return to pure fantasy. I *love* fantasy mixes of steampunk, modern times, and whatever else but they haven't gone hard on fantasy like this since the 2D era. FFXIV is amazing but despite it being the most fantasy feeling one yet it still does go straight Sci-Fi quite often.
        Even the first Final Fantasy has robots and a space station.

Final Fantasy 4 is as much sci-fi as it is medieval European fantasy and it's awesome for it (it also throws ninjas and martial arts in the mix because it's [the rule of cool](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool)).
    Here I am just wanting X vibes again.
        X-3 please
    Am excited for XVI but completely agree with you. Hoping KH4 can scratch some of that itch (though it's definitely some years away from release)
        Absolutely, can't wait for KH4! Obviously still excited for this game but it just isn't grabbing me right now.
    You have had your pseudo-modern fantasy sci-fi in FF13, FF15 and FF7 Remake. Geez, leave some for the rest of us that want some novelty in our lives.
For me, I feel like I need to stop treating Final Fantasy games as Final Fantasy games and just act like it's a new title. I'm still bitter just because I miss and loved the old turn-based combat. I end up just going in disappointed to every new title as a result as, once again, they keep trying to "update" it and make it cool.
I think I'm personally just kind of oversaturated in this type of medieval fantasy setting right now. Even if you aren't following all of them (I'm not) it's everywhere and hard to ignore. GoT/the new show, LotR/RoP, Elden Ring, Dark Souls, ~~FFXV (despite having new tech)~~, FFXII, or SoP. Grand political stuff just hasn't hit the same as the weirder FF plots like VII or X for me. This could still go somewhere for sure, but right now to me its just  more broody castle stuff
    TBH I wish they went all in on the grand political stuff.

FFXV to me felt like it didn't have much grand political stuff and the stuff it did have was pretty on the surface type stuff.
    FF12 was 17 years ago. FF15 is definitely sci-fi fantasy. FF7 Remake is sci-fi steampunk fantasy. And the rest you mentioned are not even remotely related to FF.

We haven't had a regular fantasy experience in the singleplayer games in 17 years and you are oversaturated? This is ridiculous
    buddy if FF15 is too "medieval" for you then I really don't know how an FF game could satisfy while still justifying the "fantasy" in its title.
        FFXV was definitely not the right vibe I was thinking of, I’m mostly remembering altissia being very cathedral-y apparently
    It doesn't even seem like we'll written broody castle stuff tbh.
    For sure.

I'd take a X-3 over anything else right now personally
    FFVII and FFX got political too. VII with the greedy corporation and X with the religion.
For me it's the exact opposite, the setting and return to more classic medieval fantasy looks stellar, I like the more bleak tone and warring nations thing they're setting up, but absolutely nothing they've shown for gameplay looks interesting at all to me.
    I don't mind/love the setting, FFT was one of my favorite games after all, but this all looks and sounds generic. I'm not sure how this setup is any different from Square Enix's lower tier RPGs like Triangle Strategy and the like. They've made plenty of these kinds of games over the past few years themselves. This one just has higher production values (but not high enough to be worthy of the FF moniker, IMO, this series has always pushed the envelope w/ presentation).
        Definitely Triangle Strategy vibes from the "look at our many warring cultures: the normal one, the snooty one, the Arabic one..." bit.
It made me have a real boomer gamer moment. I had no idea what was going on, between the seemingly convoluted political intrigue to the people animorphing into summon spirits. Combat looking like a series of cutscenes in between button mashing.

Then I couldnt help but laugh when the super serious guys and gals with gruff English accents started talking about crystals. The series obsession with crystals as magic holy McGuffins no matter what the setting is will never not be funny to me.

Listening to To Zanarkand the other day had me nostalgic but after seeing this trailer just...man. We ain't never going back there huh?
Yeah I feel the same, I was wondering if I was the only one. I'm just so tired of all the FF characters looking like the same smoothboi. Aside from that I still hate the new action combat style FF has adopted since 13ish, but I'm aware that's probably just me showing my age and I guess at this point I just have to accept that FF is a game I watch now instead of play. I hope the story is good though.
    The three Final Fantasy combat system since XIII are nothing like each other so I'm a bit confused about what you find bad in common about them.
        I would argue it actually goes back to 12, not 13. It's the idea that you pick one character and AI controls the rest. I'm not counting 11, because that's an MMO, but in 1-10 you control your whole party. From 12 to (seemingly) 16, you pick one character to control, and the AI does the rest. That "frees" them to make the combat more interactive. I put "frees" in quotations, because in practice it seems to actually just result in every character playing like a fighter, because the mages are best left to AI, since they require the least input, and the AI will control melee very suboptimally.
            Oh I'd totally agree it just felt like 12 was sort of a weird experiment that although it's easy to see how it inspired what came after it, was still different enough that I felt like I shouldn't say 12 and beyond, but honestly you're right.
            I found the opposite. If you left the AI in control of the makes then they would chew through your MP far faster than it would replenish. 7R didn't even bother having the AI use MP.
        [deleted]
            Yep agreed, and those were also some of my favorites (including Persona for me). I mean I don't begrudge them for changing the style and I'm not out here shaking my fist saying they need to go back; if it's making them more money etc. that's just the way things evolve sometimes and I get that, it's just personally I'm not a fan.
I think we’ve just had so much of the newer age FF that people are happy to go back to this medieval era classic style final fantasy. It’s been since like FF9 since we’ve had that.
> I really have never liked the FF UI design, like the pop ups during combat and stuff really take me out of it.

Nearly every single FF has been different...kind of a weird opinion to come to under those circumstances.
every leader of every faction is also a dude. either with a beard, big muscles, or both.
I wouldn't call Tidus androgynous, but we've definitely never had a dude as dudely as this guy before.
what final fantasy's have angdrogynous protagonists? the only one i can think of is MAYBE onion knight.
    I put a huge list below but the early arts were pretty andro for most protags, but usually when they reappear in games like Dissidia they look better.

Except for Bartz. He really went for the full David Bowie, eye-liner, andro supreme look.
    7, 10, 15 all have pretty boy protagonists. Maybe 12 if you consider Vaan the protagonist but he's really young and Basch doesn't fit that description. 

As for the rest I'm thinking about it and 6 and 13 have clearly female protagonists, I wouldn't call Squall androgynous, 9 has a goofy art style that doesn't make anyone look androgynous, 11 and 14 are MMOs. 

All of Amano's characters look extremely androgynous but 1-5 are old enough that the pixel art doesn't really capture his art style that well.
        Vaan's the guy you walk around as outside of combat, so I'd definitely call him the protag, as much as there is a single one.  And I certainly wouldn't call Squall or Zidane "dudely."
            Yeah if the question is just whether or not the characters are dudely then zidane and squall definitely don't qualify as dudely. Squalls got enough edgy bad boy vibes so he doesn't seem androgynous to me and Zidane is like a weird monkey boy who I wouldn't call manly but he's very boyish.
            >Vaan's the guy you walk around as outside of combat

He's the errand boy
            He was added post Matsuno basically as the character the player could identify with instead of a dude in his mid 30s - I can't remember if Basch or Balthier was meant to be the player character early on. Everything rotates around Ashe though.
                Basch was the original main
    7, 8, and 9 are the big ones. 15 not quite so much but still firmly in pretty-boy territory.
    Yeah I can't think much about that either. Tidus is perhaps not really beastly, but Squall is mannish, Cloud has a pretty face but obvious man muscles. I guess Vaan? But he's also mostly a child.
        Vaan kind of has an excuse too, the execs wanted a young relatable main lead so they shoehorned him in, which is why he kind of just feels like he's tagging along on the journey and basically stops being the main character 5 hours in.
    Vaan from ffxii comes to mind.
FFXIV fans and Matsuno (FF Tactics, FF12, Tactics Ogre) fans eat all this political and world building shit up. I love it and the character action gameplay.
    I'm still sad that Matsuno's stuff in 14 wasn't that well-received and Matsuno fans won't get another taste.

Ishikawa's stories are a bit too character driven for my taste.
    The politics as they presented it thus far looks even less interesting than the trailers for Triangle Strategy or Diofield.
It's not Ivalice, but Yoshida is a HUGE fan of Matsuno's work so expect a lot of similarities.
    Really? The trailer mentions Rosaria and Dalmasca so I was hopeful...
If it *isn't* set in the same world there are a lot of coincidences when it comes to place names. Valisthea shares the "valis" part with Ivalice. Rosaria is essentially Rozzaria. Dhalmekia is quite similar to Dalmasca. The design of the armour reminds me a lot of the Judges, and even the focus on crystals is something it shares with FF12.
Each game isn't connected. They are entirely different universes that has some similar elements between them (i.e monsters, eidolons, names.. etc) .  It can sometimes be a futureistic setting, mordern, medieval, or a mix of all.
Whoa..you're right. I wonder if it's the introductory scenes with the war that escalated it to M, because I can't think of anything else in the game that would make it an M.
    To quote the ESRB:

> This is an action game in which players assume the role of students fighting to protect their nation from invaders. Players traverse fantasy environments and battle enemy soldiers and other creatures in melee-style combat. Players use swords, bows, firearms, and magic spells to kill various enemies (e.g., robots, blobs, mechanical beasts). Battles are accompanied by realistic gunfire, screams of pain, and large blood-splatter effects; some sequences depict blood stains on players' screen and corpses lying in pools of blood. Cutscenes depict additional acts of violence: a man stabbing himself with a sword; a girl shot by a sniper; a character shot close-up. During the course of the game, some female characters are depicted in outfits that expose large amounts of cleavage and jiggling breasts. In one sequence, players can use a spy camera to zoom in on a female character wearing a bikini. The game includes event scenes in which a character sedates/drugs players' character and performs unknown acts on them; it is implied that some of these acts may be of a sexual nature.
        If you told me this description was for Fire Emblem, I wouldn't question it.
            Doesn't get that much breast and cleavage in Fire Emblem Three Houses
                Nah, but Heroes more than makes up for it
        Aiit I'm preordering this game now. 😭 These ratings just sold me.
            I'm pretty sure that's for Final Fantasy Type-0, not FFXVI
    In Type—0 at the end of each battle you steal your enemies souls as they’re vaporized into a cloud of red mist… the game has a lot of scenes that are pretty violent and bloody.
    [removed]
        They're talking about Type-0 I'm pretty sure
            Yep!
Why wasn't Stranger of Paradise R? It was a big boy adult game >:(
    It WAS M rated though... Also had the first FF f-bomb
        also had the first FF Limp Bizkit-bomb
        That was an awesome scene, too.

People can say what they want about that game.  It knows what it's about.
            It was about stopping chaos?
    Rated C for CHAOS!!
Stranger of Paradise too
Wait, the game where one of the antagonist's backstory is that she was sold into sexual slavery by her parents is only rated T?
    Theres a LOT of dark themes in 14, that i am surprised that still T, i cant imagine what more stuff Yoshi P and team will created if the game was rated M.
        Endwalker has two scenes in a particular zone that I still can't believe are in a T rated game.
            Yeah, >!dunno how they got away with some dude putting a gun in his mouth and pulling the trigger with a T rating tbh.!<
                Yoshi-P's team has mastered the art of "implying but not showing" in FFXIV. You never actually seen the guy put the gun in his mouth, but the audience could put two and a two together within the context.
                A guy shot himself on-screen in Insomniac's Spider-Man and that got a T.
        They said they wanted *that* scene in Shadowbringers to not happen while obscured but couldn't because of the T rating
            Which scene was this?
                Poor Tesleen.
    The keyword here is implication
As long as they don't say that's what happened all's good

But a wink wink nudge nudge doesn't hurt
What's interesting about the game engine that *Final Fantasy XVI* uses is that there have yet to been any confirmations or announcements what engine it is; among speculated has been the Luminous Engine, Unreal Engine, an extension of FFXIV's engine (Itself once been an amalgamation of both Luminous and Crystal Tools.) e.t.c. It wasn't until last month that a user at the /r/FFXVI-subreddit managed to [scour a technical presentation Square made back in 2018](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFXVI/comments/x2ro5c/which_engine_would_ffxvi_use_crystal_tools_or/imlavqh/?context=3) of what was at the time a secret project, but which showcased models that were later to be shown in the FFXVI-trailers of Sanbreque's knights, and where FFXVI's director, Hiroshi Takai, served as model demonstrating of this new engine's features. Summarized was that this secret project at the time explored initially features with the Unreal Engine 4, but which the development staff found the results unsatisfactorily to their goals, to which an extension of the FFXIV-engine was utilized, as well as full time-programmers being hired solely to further develop on this engine. This times well with how later in [2020, studio CBU:III was in recruitment of further staff (Lighting director for instance.) for FFXVI, while also announcing their base production and scenario complete, while further developing of their toolsets](https://www.gematsu.com/2020/10/final-fantasy-xvi-basic-development-and-scenario-production-already-complete).

The engine-speculation was further stoked by how Square Enix last month made [trade-marking for what they called the *Radec Engine*](https://www.gematsu.com/2022/09/square-enix-trademarks-radec-engine-in-japan), which we have no information other than the name itself of what it entails of. So far, Square currently mainly utilizes Unity, Unreal Engine, Luminous Engine and FFXIV's engine for their games, so question remains what this *Radec Engine* is to be, and if FFXVI is the first entry of it.
    Interesting. Square Enix invested a lot in the Luminous engine, and it was surprising to see FF7R use Unreal instead of their own, presumably very costly, engine.

Luminous definitely still has the potential to bring consoles and PC's to their knees, and FFXV still looks great. I thought SE has given up on their engine but perhaps there's more life in it with FFXVI
        They're using Luminous for Forspoken. Looks basically exactly like 15
I have not, I spent 6 years playing WoW so I'm sworn off all MMOs going forward lol. 

I do have a few friends who have played/still play FF14 and they always speak highly of the OST, so I knew Soken most likely would deliver.
    If it helps FFXIV is designed around *not* keeping you addicted. The devs literally said they want players to just play for a bit every new patch, then return back to other games. There's no daily logins, they dont remove content and its designed so old content is always active, and they're even adding the ability to just play through the main story with an NPC party over other players. You can basically just play through it as a singleplayer game by design.
        Came to say this! I signed up summer of 2020 so I could mentally survive the pandemic and its been one of my best gaming choices ever. No pressure.
            Me and my friends joined just before the pandemic kicked off and its been a wild ride. I already enjoyed the game but once I reached shadowbringers it became an all-time classic rivalling the rose-tinted glasses of the other games. Endwalker launch was a special time for me too, theres a great feeling of community running along the main quests with all the other players, and its great just being able to pop on a few times a year to catch up on content rather than feeling obligated to be on every single day.
                Endwalker was my first time being truly caught up to MSQ. There's a certain *je ne sais quo* about going through an area and seeing two dozen people in the same innocuous spot, all watching a cutscene.

I sped through the entire expansion in a week, and to this day I still think >!Ultima Thule is one of the most beautifully haunting area in the game, if not in games period.!<
                    That last walk was one of the heaviest things I’ve seen from a game.
        [deleted]
            there is a free trial you can play the base game and first expansion up to level 60. I hear it's critically acclaimed....
                Specifically speaking the trial takes you through one of the best story arcs in the game with the Heavansward expansion, it will give you a really good idea if the game is something you want to continue
            It does
            > Does it still require a monthly subscription?

The game has multiple expansions

A Realm Reborn > Heavensward > Stormblood > Shadowbringers > Endwalker.

You get to play ARR and HW for free, which should last you about 200 hours. ARR is a bit slow, but HW has a great story.
                Another note is that if you buy Endwalker you get all the previous expansions with it. Only ever need to buy the latest expac, and you get all of them.
                    But if you buy the game keep in mind that you can't access the trial anymore. So you should play until lvl 60 and finish heavensword and then buy the game
        It'll just take half a year of casual play to catch up.
            Nothing to really "catch up" with if your main draw is the campagin. Just go at it at your own pace and enjoy one of the best rides in video games.
                Yeah been playing it at a pretty slow pace for over a year and am at Endwalker, been an incredible experience and I'm really glad I haven't rushed myself.
                Sure but when you have friends talk you into it like most of the time when you get into an MMO and everyone's excited about this new expansion coming or that new patch and then it's like cool but in a year and a half you can be there.
            The thing is, unlike WoW, the "real game" game isn't at the end. The game is the journey as well as the destination. It's amazing.


You can even join a guild (Free Company) and they can *join you* in the biggest moments, their levels getting synced down without making the content completely trivial for people who haven't seen it a million times. It's just a really fun game that goes on and on and on. ...Once you get through most of ARR. Ooph.
                I agree the story experience is breathtaking, but even then the actual gameplay during questing is somehow even less engaging than leveling usually is, and I could not stand how on one hand the game was constantly making me disband my party to do certain quests but then on the other hand would make me join other big parties to do others, and some of those big group quests would be brain dead dungeons or they'd be challenging raids that you actually needed to study up on to get past. It's like I had to both care and not care more than I wanted to the whole time.

But again when you really were into the story it's like you could've dropped all the gameplay and just traveled from story beat to story beat. Whatever quests had you actually do felt like afterthoughts.
                    Oh 100%. One of the things I miss from WoW is how clever and variable the quests got over time. Still simple stuff, but different.


14 has some neat stuff but it comes later on in the form of solo duties, and those and few and far between. Many agree basically solo boss fights. There was one brilliant and memorable one in Endwalker, though.
                    I think the core problem is the first 2 expansions, despite their attempts to fix them (it’s been over a year for me, maybe 2?) are a real slog story wise IMO.

So unless you can skip through it but still get the story to lead into the other stuff it’s a big ask for a casual player. But they’re doing something right so my archmchair analysis is worth less than a grain of salt.
            > It'll just take half a year of casual play to catch up.

Way more. The main campaign that gets you to max level alone is what, 600 hours long?

I no lifed it last year, from ARR to the end of Endwalker, and it took me 2 months to finish it.

But the MSQ is the game's strongest point by far so that's fine. It's a fantastic story.
                It really is.
        when is that npc update out you think?
        > You can basically just play through it as a singleplayer game by design.

That's because it is a single player game at its core. 

After reaching EndWalker, I can say this game feels like a 300 hours cinematic where you occasionally kill mobs and rarely group with other players.
        > There's no daily logins

Are you sure you played the game? There's both daily and weekly grinds, golden saucer, and a bunch of other random stuff with daily/weekly caps.
            Oh, there’s always something you can spend your time on, but none of it is mandatory. You can always get caught up in short order if you step away for a time.
                Same is true for WoW as well. Return at the start of a new patch and you have a bunch of catchup mechanics.
    I'm a 14 year WoW refugee. Zero regrets. No addiction (except the "addiction" of wanting to play any games you look forward to), but I don't feel like I'm missing out if I don't play for a week.
        The problem with FF14 with me is that the game require a monthly sub, and I would feel guilty if I only play 2-4 hours a week. Hence I swore it off instead of trying to play for the sake of playing.

That is why I like GW2 better...I can quit for six years and still be ready to go through end game content cause GW2 gears don't become obsolete.
            I usually just put FF14 off for a few months and come back when there’s a few major patches of content to get through. I don’t really see it as an MMO you keep coming back to every day. At least unless you really love the world and get sucked into every side activity. 

Even the endgame’s progression is very short once you’re there, so it doesn’t feel like you need to stay subscribed for months.
            Sure--that makes total sense to me.

I've also been a Final Fantasy fan since the original in the 80s, though, so 14 was an easy and nostalgic sell for me when I transitioned.
    I feel like we’ll all be in for a treat with 16 because Soken really hasn’t missed in 14.
    Here is Soken. Bow before his majesty. https://youtu.be/shWBppGY5G4
    I mean, if u like singleplayer rpgs then ff14 is a great choice. the mmo stuff is optional. Its just another final fantasy game with some multiplayer elements. They are even making it so that you can do the whole story without interacting with other players.
Do you know... la hee? 

Man I love Soken. I can't think of a single track I would mute (other than the Gold Saucer music, but I feel like that's their way of discouraging you from staying in the casino too long!)
    I turn off the battle music, just gets in the way of the nice area themes. Especially the night ones.
[Are we acting like FF 15 didn't have an amazing OST either?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkKVUswNxX8)
    No. I was pointing out that since the person above me liked the music in the trailer they might want to check out the music in 14 because that’s the same composer.
    "I really like coke!"

"Wow I can't believe you're hating Pepsi like that"
Do you know.... Lahi?
It's been discribed as a roller coaster of action by the producer so it might be cutscene > small gameplay segment fighting mooks > Eikon fight loop, which to be fair when your character can channel the power of gods at will it's hard to find regular people that would be a challenge. 

We also haven't seen much signs of monsters.
    There were a Morbol and a Coeurl in the initial reveal trailer, at the very least.
The reason why they don't show gameplay that much is because YoshiP is known to be such a stickler when it comes to trailers. In fact, if it was up to him, he wouldn't even release trailers now. He would release it like 6 months before release. He really hates spoiling things early. Only reason we are getting trailers is because he's being forced to.

They already mentioned that the game is at the final touches. Whatever gameplay you think they are hiding because they are not satisfied, is already done. They have been doing QA for the last year now as they mentioned in a past producer letter.
    okay but I don't. Really believe that. I don't think that this game is going unreleased through a year and a half of QA without there being any significant parts of it they're unsatisfied with. Performance issues are currently my frontrunner and would be a very strong reason for not showing off anything besides cutscenes \~9 months out from release. I am aware of what Yoshi P prefers but a comprehensible 15 straight seconds of what the game actually looks like to play or any of the things you do in it besides Hit A Guy is not spoilers. It's not necessary for FFXIV trailers because everyone already knows how that game plays because it's been out for almost a decade.
        It's spoilers for him because he already said there will be characters who will be with the MC when he goes to different places. So what does that mean? If he shows a trailer with the protagonist with other people that makes it already a spoiler because people will have an idea what will happen on when and where.

That's enough of a spoiler for him.

Also I think you should know that the game was supposed to release this year but SE moved it back just for Forspoken.
Yeah, I feel like the character models look like a human version of an anime character. There's like an extra layer of translation between what actual people look like since it's going human>anime>model instead of just human>model.
    It feels almost Gamecubey to me? But obviously extremely modern and polished.

I think it's the lack of shadows/depth in character models that makes it feel almost like 3d modern characters but on a flat plane. I get the same thing with From Soft games though.
        Could it also be that their irises don't move completely like humans? If you look at [Cindy](https://youtu.be/8PMDFu9d83Y?t=446) in FFV15,  she has the big eye movements to change what she's looking at but not the little flicks (saccades) that actual people do. Compare for example [Kingsglaive](https://youtu.be/UblcNFVVHT8?t=51), and the fact that the pre-rendered cutscenes in FFXV do have them.

Their movements are also a little stiff outside of fighting, anytime they walk, run or gesture it's somewhat exaggerated. Although that might be intentional so it adds to the feeling of dynamism. 

Also the fact that their faces don't deform that much when they move. Compare [Ellie's facial expressions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-iZiuT0zPU) in The Last of Us Part II even in the still-posed Model Viewer, she has cheek creases and brow creases and her hair moves realistically.  

Actually compare Noctis and >!Sid!< from FFXV [in the same scene alone](https://youtu.be/8PMDFu9d83Y?t=467). >!Sid!<'s irises still don't move, but >!his!< whole face is full of wrinkles and creases that are moving and giving a lot of detail. In comparison, Noctis only moves his eyes, cheeks and lips a little, and no wrinkles in sight. Even more true for their hands, arms, tight-fitting clothing, etc..

(No shade by the way, just observations.)
Because FF characters are really really really good looking.
The elimination of said pacing issues could be due to FFXVI will be the first *Final Fantasy*-title to utilize English as its original language, along with how it was [confirmed last year that the voice actors will also be doing motion-capture for the game](https://www.siliconera.com/final-fantasy-xvi-will-feature-full-facial-mocap-using-english-voice-actors/). So the voice actors aren't just voicing, but seems to also be delivering their lines in a real-time fashion similar to how *Resident Evil VIII*, *Guardians of the Galaxy* and most other major cinematic games does their performances.
    Just as god intended
    > FFXVI will be the first Final Fantasy-title to utilize English as its original language

I didn't know that! That actually explains why the English voice acting is so good! I speak Japanese and always prefer Japanese for anime/games, but FF16 is the first time I've felt the English VA is better.

When the first trailer came out I was shocked by how good the English voice acting and lines were. I was even telling my friend they were so good that I felt like the lines had been written in English first then translated to Japanese afterwards, rather than the other way round that it is for every other game. I'm actually impressed with myself that I was able to tell lol
Only one single character in XIV talks with the "extreme olde english" because he's a nerd who grew up spending more time with books than with others.
    Yeah, especially later on in the story Urianger is a a joy. They turned "generic scholar who speaks fancy" into "bookworm nerd who spends so much time studying old tomes that he cant speak properly, so everybody gives out and makes fun of him for it". One of my favourite characters.
        I'm glad they doubled down on him and Y'stola.  They're two if the better written characters in FF history.  They both start out generic, but you really get to know them as time goes on.  And tbh, they don't really change that much, you just understand why they're the way they are, which is amazing writing.  Less Flanderization, more depth.
            It's hard to single out most of the main party but I'd probably throw Thancred in there too. Starts off as the "cool playboy" type and really gets some fantastic depth by the end of Shadowbringers.
                Special mention to Alphinaud throughout Heavensward. He was ablittle shit in A Realm Reborn, but he grew into a far more likeable person by the end. His growth as he became more humble was well done.
                    Hell Alisaie too. She went from being stuffed into a highly optional raid series to being her own character who stands apart from her brother.
                        Oh yes, getting to spend more time with her was one of the best parts of Stormblood.

But Alisale wasnt ablittle shit like her twin lol
                            It was honestly the highlight for me. I love both the twins now, they really balance each other out. It was great finally getting to know her. They're really playing the long-form format well, having minor characters reappear from years ago to become lead roles, >!and also having leading characters retire to side ones as they do their own things!< really makes the world feel alive and natural. Its the same reason One Piece feels like such a grand adventure.
                From Playboy Thancred to Depressed Dadcred
                The stuff with him and Ryne is so so fucking good. Maybe my absolute favorite moment in ShB is the scene with him in the graveyard though.
        Absolutely in my top 3 as well. Pretty well every scene he's in during later expansions is impeccably written and acted.
FF14 has really good voice acting, but the flow can feel stilted because it (usually) allows you to pause between line deliveries due to it being an MMO and needing to give people a chance to step away from the keyboard.


The only character who routinely talks in olde English is Urianger, and it’s done as half comic relief and to heighten certain monologues.
    I think the reason why Urianger speaks in old English is because in the Japanese version he speaks very formally. To localize it, the team decided to make him speak in Shakespearean like English and it added charm to Urianger.
        [deleted]
            Dragon Quest does this, it actually tends to work pretty well.
            I know Xenoblade 2 used accents to highlight where a character came from. The Blades typically had an American accent (from metropolitan to valley girl to high school venacular), people from the more agriculturally focused Gormott had Welsh accents, or the people from Mor Ardain had Scottish accents. This feature sort of carried on in Xenoblade 3 (since it follows XC1 and 2).
            Final Fantasy IX had a great localisation IMO which used different accents etc (although obviously it's not voiced).
        Also back in 1.0 he has a pretty wild storyline that the olde English played into. Urianger recognized the obscure prophecy van Darnus was using as a road map for Project Meteor... so he traveled around reciting those exact prophecies to distract van Darnus so he(?)° didn't notice the Circle of Knowing working on stopping Project Meteor. It worked great, and it's a pity there are no callbacks to this in Garlean related content later on.

°English localization screwed up here, long story short in Japanese Nael was female from the start but her gender was never explicitly mentioned; you can do that in Japanese without it being suspicious like avoiding all gender references would be in English. Localizers assumed the enemy commander was male. That's why the dialogue in Coils is so bizarre; the localizers skip the *obvious* Samus reveal explanation for "him" being a woman and go for Bahamut changing Nael's gender for... reasons. This was later retconned further to a female relative stepping into the original Nael's armor after his death.

    Thanks for your reply, really interesting info! I did play XIV from about 1.16 all the way through to Stormblood but I didn't know a lot of this background info about the team.
ha that's funny. I ended up really liking the English dub for FF7R. They all really grew on me, especially Barrett, Aerith, and Tifa.
It's probably because of Koji Fox doing the localization. Most localization leads aren't as high up the chain as Koji is in Business Division 3 so he's afforded a bit more.
I feel the same, the Japanese VA actually sounds a bit off somehow.
    Apparently the dialogue was written in English originally, so the Japanese VAs are using translated lines. They sound "off" for the same reason every English dub of anime sounds off, it's at least partially due to the translations. It all makes sense to me now lol
        16 is done by the same team as 14, and 14's localization is an interesting one. That one is done in Japanese first, but the English localization is so well-done that even a good chunk of Japanese players prefer it to the original Japanese. 14's JP script isn't bad, but it's kind of generic fantasy in some places; it's really more of a testament to just how beloved the EN localization is.

So now with 16, I believe it was reported that they did all the English voice work *first* and then translated it back into Japanese, with 14's much-beloved head of localization Michael-Christopher "Koji" Fox being the Localization Director for 16 as well.
Why wouldn't you post his actual [masterpiece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6dTkAmpfI)?
    When you know which clip they're referring to before even clicking on the link...
    Do you know LA HEE? I sure do.
    I'm going to need some context here. That was....something else.
        Soken usually does a goofy performance during Fan Fests.

In 2016 he [played](https://youtu.be/KwKUnJ2yO7s) a dungeon theme using two instruments and then just kicking a cardboard box.
        FFXIV's third expansion, Shadowbringers, has a day time track called "Civilizations" for one of its six zones. Pretty much from day one when the expansion released the "LA HEE" got memed hard and still does to this day. The FFXIV team does fanfests every two years (usually used as a staging grounds to tease and announce the next expansion) where they do loads of stuff for and with the playerbase.

The clip you're confused about is from the fanfest 2021, which would have normally been three separate ones spread over the late fall 2020 to early spring 2021 in Japan, the US and Europe but due to the pandemic they streamed it. One of the sections was about several of the ingame tracks of the game, either played on piano, by the game's own band (THE PRIMALS) or by the man, Masayoshi Soken, himself like the video linked above. Basically a giant love letter to the community, showing that pretty much every part of the development team is in tune with the community.

At another part of the fanfest, the team did another homage to a meme where [members of the dev team danced to the live version of the "A Long Fall" track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6tEi-6BLsw) that plays [during one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NApxz5bSl20) of the [Shadowbringers dungeons.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9QD25nakt8) The different colors of the shirts stand for tank (blue), healer (green) and DPS (red) - representing a dungeon group.
        This is from the fan festival in 2021, where the devs put on a convention to celebrate the game. There's often a bunch of announcements, events, and as you see here, a concert. 2021 was fully remote due to COVID.

The singer, Soken, is the main composer of FFXIV and is very highly regarded. This was one of the songs in the concert, which was a cover of a [overworld theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ascfjJXDWjo). One of the lyrics in the theme is La Hee, which has become a meme in the FF community. 

So basically, this legend walks on stage with no preamble, goes "Do you know La Hee?" and starts to sing... that. It was hilarious.
        To add on to the rest of the context: 

Soken's always had a silly side where he's not afraid to go on stage and act the fool to put on some truly memorable performances, but this particular FanFest (where the above took place) he announced that he'd spent much of the pandemic secretly working from the hospital where he was being treated for cancer. He only told as many people as he had to in order to make the working arrangement possible and asked that they keep it secret from the rest of the development team, so that he could work as "normally" as possible. 

He went on to say that his cancer is completely in remission and that the thought of the fans enjoying his work got him through the experience. So in addition to his general silliness, I think there's a hefty dose of "I'm still alive to be able to do this!" thrown in there as well.
        It's Civilizations from the [Rak'Tika Greatwood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ascfjJXDWjo) zone in FFXIV, Soken wanted to perform it himself as he originally intended it.
Shimamura and Hamauzu were good too but Soken really is the closest thing we've had to a replacement for Uematsu. Just incredible.
    The dude's range is absolutely bonkers. From bangers like [Under the Weight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WR1-pds8qM) to "this should be in every music to relax to playlist" like [Sultana Dreaming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG-BIMPtC9k) (Uldah Night Theme).
        I was fortunate enough to play FFXIV for many hours with a good friend.

Later, during a particularly difficult part of my life I rediscovered Sultana Dreaming, I absolutely broke down sobbing, it felt like home. Like being safe around good friends with peace in your heart.

Whenever I listen to it to this day I still am comforted in a way that is difficult to describe.
        or when he remixes an old song and does.. [amazing things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsX6nxwCZ1o)
    I'm gonna say it. For me, he's surpassed Uematsu. I'm more of a rock music kinda guy, so Soken starting from that as his square one means his tracks often just hit the tone better for me.
Yoko Shimomura is fantastic
Hellfire, Somnus Ultima, Wanderlust, Apocalypsis Noctis and its variants, Ignis main theme. Absolutely epic and amazing soundtracks
    No Valse di Fantastica?
        I was just listing off the top of my head!
IDK how he keeps releasing a new banger every single patch of FFXIV. Man is a machine
    Well that's because he's no longer the sole composer of the game and others joined over the time as well. Soken is fantastic, but other composers like Daiki Ishikawa and Takafumi Imamura deserves as much credit as Soken, too
        (Some minor spoilers for Endwalker below via song titles)

For those unaware, Ishikawa and Imamura were responsible for (or heavily involved in) creating such songs as: The Black Wolf Stalks Again, Your Answer, the Sharlayan daytime theme, the Ktisis Hyperborea theme, and the Endwalker dungeon boss theme, and several of the dynamis themes.

Soken probably still deserves the lion's share of credit for building FFXIV's musical identity, but his team are fantastic composers and arrangers in their own right.
            The remixes in Endwalker of other expansion songs were great at repurposing the vibes of the original songs with adding new character to them.  Really well done by those composers and the team.
    ff14 wasn't for me but that soundtrack is killer
    the two horsemen of bangers every patch: soken and yu peng chen

we need to find two more consistent sources of every patch a banger so we have the four horsemen though
Yeah, even generally considered "not that great" entries like [15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xkv3HbHBdBI) and [13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKR5lSKeZxk) have amazing soundtracks
>With Yoshi P at the helm

Well Yoshida *isn't* at the helm, the director is Hiroshi Takai, whose probably most well known for [The Last Remnant...](https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/the-last-remnant)
    that's great to hear. The Last Remnant was probably the only singleplayer RPG they made where you felt like exploring an actual world with good fantasy elements and having an actual team at your side in the entire PS3 era of Square Enix
        The Last Remnant was a middling game that was severely weighed down by its confusing explanation (or lack thereof) regarding the combat and party systems that was perhaps a little *too* RNG and automated, because in the end you're only influencing the battle.

However, it's really unfortunate that people almost never give the world, races, art and music of The Last Remnant the time of day because of how under the radar it is. It's full of concepts that are so cool and a lot of them are executed very well... it's just actually playing the game where half of the time I'm scratching my head or beating it against a brick wall. I agree with you, and I am excited for FFXVI, but still..

Further pissed off that the Remastered version of the game looks graphically far superior and is a great remaster, but is locked to console at max 1080p (because it came out before PS4 Pro) with no patch, and they REMOVED the prexisting PC version from all digital storefronts with no announcement or hint whatsoever that we'll get a port of the remaster.
            I’ve had this game in my steam library for ages. Is this some kind underperforming inferior version? I know nothing about it other than buying it ages ago.
                The PC version is perfectly fine, it runs very well and works right out of the box with controllers too (you may have to switch to controller control setting and max the graphics first). Funnily enough, it was considered probably the only good JRPG port on PC for years upon years despite the game itself not being hot.

The remastered version on console moves it to Unreal Engine 4 and honestly it's very impressive how much of UE4 they shoved into it without it looking like a rush job. And it also adds a super-sprint mode that lets you run in the overworld sections MUCH faster... that's it.
            The PC port doesn't really run at 4k either so you're not missing anything. I have both, the console versions have better lighting while the pc version has better framerates.
        Game was terrible, but had a cool world and ideas that were executed poorly.
    The Last Remnant was great, though
    Oh shit I loved last remnant. Nice
Damn, talk about an all-star team. I had no idea.
    SQEX is pulling out all the stops by bringing out their Aces.
        They probably have to, in order to restore faith in the series after how FFXV was (understandably) received.
            I liked FFXV!

Bad Final Fantasy game but great camping with your buddies simulator.
                Ffxv is a interesting “failure”. For like every part it does well there’s 3 parts that are poorly developed.

But I think it’s the best FF game to establish the party as a real group. As opposed to a band of characters joining together for a common goal. Like they really were friends and it was obvious.

The campfire scene in the end of the game I think is a payoff worthy of getting through some of the slog that is the game.

Great world, lore, just poorly connected and told. I would love for them to redo it one day the way properly.
                I really like it too but they pretty blatantly gave up on the game/world halfway through their DLC plans. I think we ultimately got 4/7 character DLCs and one ok MP DLC. There's quite a bit of that story they deliberately left out.
                FFXV flirting with magical realism for its world is infinitely more interesting to me than the drab fantasy world for FFXVI.  I don't fault anyone for liking it though and wanting a return to that type of setting given it's integral to the series' history.
            > after how FFXV was (understandably) received.

And FF13, and FF13-2, and FF13-3, and to some extent FF12.   
They really need to restore people faith in mainline non MMO Final Fantasy games.
        And keeping Nomura well the fuck away.

That gives me hope.
            Some of you act like Nomura killed your families.
                In another timeline he might have!!
                    He kills your family in a random card battler side game off the main series
                        that ends up being pivotal to the plot for the next decade
                    I bet it was actually his nobody Romnuxa traveling between worldlines with the power of waking. Easy mistake to make
                    Underrated comment. Next thing you know, Donald and Goofy will show up!
                My family died in the pouch and zipper wars so he did.
                Nomura didn't kill my family, he just won't leave my damn house.
            >Game has nothing to do with Nomura, he's not even remotely involved

reddit: GRRR NOMURA
                Nomura is writing the last 2 books of ASOIF? The delayed release makes so much sense now...
            Nomura has had some kind of creative input in nearly every single good thing that Square Enix has ever created.

Why the hate?
                Nomura to me is like Zack Snyder, dude is really good at what made his name (Nomura a character designer, Snyder was a director of photography) but when they started to get director roles, that's when it got meh.

I think that the first 2 KH games are good, but that's it. Everything else that he was involved as a director is sub par, but when he gets to just design things, he does a good job.
                    kingdom hearts is really the only series he's directed, sans the f7 remake, but he wasn't responsible for the unpopular changes to its narrative despite people thinking it. even seems like most don't realize how much he contributed to the original

his work as producer/concept creator also extends to twewy and stranger of paradise, both of which are good!
                        TWEWY’s design is top notch
                    I don’t even think he’s a bad director per se, but he reminds me a bit of George Lucas where he needs someone to keep his ideas in check. I love KH1 and 2, along with the VII remake, and he’s not the primary writer on any of those. He’s got a good eye for visual flair, generally fun gameplay decisions and can come up with some interesting plot points, but he needs a good writer and producer to reign him in or it just goes off the rails and becomes too much.
I already knew about those things, but I still get that certain Vince McMahon gif-like reading that every time lol. 

I mean, YoshiP and his team at FFXIV are literally the last bastion of FF-sanity over there at Square-Enix. That alone gets me interested in FFXVI.
    I wouldn't completely count out the FFVIIR team. Regardless of the story direction, there is a lot of good things with the remakes in terms of presentation, graphics, characters and gameplay.
        Oh I absolutely love how they handled combat and materia progression in that. Like Character swapping alone in general. After YEARS of struggling from Square Enix to get a mix of traditional FF and action combat right. All I could think was how some other action-JRPGS would have totally benefited from that concept alone (*freaking Xenoblade Chronicles!!!).*

But to it's degree, it's a Remake of something that came before and not something new and unique at the time. FFXIII, and especially FFXV could have been treated a hell of a lot better. So unfortunately it had to be a Remake to get people back on Square's Side...or it was fantastic story/world building of a MMO that got people like me to glance at single Player Final Fantasy once again. Hence why I'llstill state that Yoshi P and Creative Business Unit III seem to be last bastion of people that want Final Fantasy to be new and unique once again. But we'll see when FFXVI lands.
        I'm hoping they're learning from their mistakes. FF7R really was an enjoyable game that I could not put down. I usually don't finish most games I buy tbh.. So to me its a really good game. definitely can name flaws, but the pros definitely outweighed the cons.
            It feels to me that Square has tons of talented people out in their company, but has difficulty reigning them in and making them focus. I think sometimes it is a clash of creative egos (which happens a lot in creative spaces, music, film, animation, etc.), sometimes it is mismanagement by the guys in charge, lack of understanding of certain technologies (i.e. FFXIII), or sometimes it is having too grand of a focus that is difficult to translate to a game (i.e. KH3, FFXV/VSXIII). FFXIV was successful partially because Yoshi P and his team found that the 1.0 team, though talented lacked focus and that sometimes caused chaos.
        Square Enix has a ton of amazing talent they just have difficulty focusing it. Yoshi P's biggest achievement was focusing the talent of the FFXIV team so hopefully he can work his magic from the start here.
Sounds like an all-star cast but this trailer having 50% of the time dedicated to introducing random countries and politics we aren't familiar with is giving me Triangle Strategy vibes.
I'm still concerned. I feel the way xv failed most was it was a single player mmo. Bunch of hubs with repetitive quests to earn XP and rewards to allow you to progress. My father was murdered. My kingdom taken over and in ruins. That one soldier guy in the movie gave his everything in that fight like a badass. I'm collecting frogs and fishing and having some great photos on my fab-bro camping trip. 

So I hope the xiv team keeps it feeling like a jrpg rather than an MMO.
    The reason FFXV failed was because of everything happening in the background in development, there was no consistency and it was sort of a rush job. All things considered it's a miracle it turned out the way it did. This game does not have anywhere near the baggage
        Nowhere was it more apparent that it was a rush job than that town you go to for Leviathan. That town was *way* too developed for it to be a one-off quest area, it was clearly intended to be another town you could regularly visit, maybe even a second hub, but all of that was casted aside. 

Imagine what XV could have been like if it was led by the XVI team. The same graphics, the same exploration, the same combat system (which, honestly, is deeper than most people give credit for), but done in a way that doesn't just feel like a road trip with the bros. 

[I still think back to when XV was originally called XIII Versus.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6At_bb1PNU)
            Agree completely. The game was terrific until then. Terrible after
        Rush job? That bitch got started and restarted like a dozen times and took forever to actually come out. Don't forget XV started as part of a threesome of games that was supposed to be XIII
            Yes, and the last build was a rush job. That's what I meant by that.
    XII was the "singleplayer MMO". And now, especially with the Zodiac Age version, its pretty well-received.
        XII was ahead of its time in many ways.  The few tweaks with Zodiac Age keeps the game feeling extremely modern.  Like if you told me Zodiac Age on switch was a new game released last year, I would believe you.
        It was mixed amongst fans.  It wasn't bad per se, but it definitely wasn't everyone's cup of tea.
            Definitely mixed - it’s actually my personal favorite. Depends on who you ask
    FFXV failed for me because the combat was trash and the story required too many extra-curriculars.
        > and the story required too many extra-curriculars

To date, it's the only mainline FF that requires those extra-curriculars to comprehend the story in full. No other FF does this.
    I mean, FF14 isn't like that at all. Its story lives up to and eventually (Heavensward, Endwalker and especially Shadowbringers) even surpasses the peaks of single player FF. The common line is 14 is a traditional JRPG with a MMO tacked on to the endgame when you finish the story.
        Ahh how soon we forget the several hours of quests where you have to gather supplies to throw a party for yourself before you're allowed to fight Titan.

Like, 14 has narrative high points for sure. But its pacing is pretty wack by nature of it being an MMO and it is inarguably 'like that' as you put it.
            It's a little disingenuous to use their earliest content as the benchmark for CBU3 instead of the all recent stuff that they've won piles of awards for. There are of course obvious limitations to the gameplay and storytelling as a consequence of FFXIV being built on a decade old MMO, but the real meat of FFXIV's story succeeds on it's own merits. You could rip it all out of the MMO and build a (very long) singleplayer mainline title out of it with minimal adjustments (Mostly just getting rid of the filler quests), and it would still be phenomenal.
                >You could rip it all out of the MMO and build a (very long) singleplayer mainline title out of it with minimal adjustments

People really underestimate how long the MSQ is. People regularly complain about JRPGs breaking the 40 hour mark, and that includes gameplay. FF14 is over 20 hours of cutscene time \*per expansion.\*

[https://www.reddit.com/user/Cyberfunk3/comments/y5gauf/ffxiv\_tracker\_62\_update\_improved\_formatting/](https://www.reddit.com/user/Cyberfunk3/comments/y5gauf/ffxiv_tracker_62_update_improved_formatting/)

A quick eyeballing of time says I 100%'d the Pixel Remasters of 1 through 4 (\~115 hours) in less time than it takes to watch cutscenes in FF14 (\~123 hours). That's watching the extended version of the LotR trilogy 10 times, and still leaving time for bathroom breaks! If you could play all of the MSQ cutscenes sequentially without having to do dungeons and walk places between them, you'd be able to put the controller/mouse down for \*five days.\*

This is tolerable when you're playing it as it comes out, but don't undersell how gargantuanly long the story is, or how much of an advantage the MMO format breaking up these story sections over literal years helps.
                    Yeah I recently created an alt and just finished the 2.0 content. Sure the story content itself is about 20 hours, and I'm honestly okay with that, but I broke it up with a *lot* of side content. I leveled all my crafters, did every blue quest I came across, and, in general, lollygagged around for days just enjoying myself. Play time came out to around 80 or 90 hours by the time I cleared Praetorium.

And it still felt like it went by in the blink of an eye. So when people say they "slogged" through ARR I just question how out of touch I must be with those players to have genuinely enjoyed myself so thoroughly for like 4-5x the length of time it probably took them to do it. Or maybe just enjoying the content on offer rather than forcing yourself to binge the MSQ is the key to having fun with it after all. Who knows? I definitely agree that people downplay how much the MMO aspect helps that long stretch of story *work*. The world wouldn't be as interesting without it. Your achievements wouldn't mean as much. A solo version of FFXIV wouldn't really be the same.
                        Well, for me 80 to 90 hours of playtime means about six months in real life, so the idea of levelling crafters (or BOT/MIN) without being able to fly or having a huge bank (i.e. spending a lot of time walking everywhere) is not that appealing to me. Different strokes for different folks, but I’m happy that I rushed the MSQ (some friends of mine just decided to buy the ARR quest skip instead) this time instead of bailing halfaway through because the downtime to meaningful content ratio was too high.

Persona 5 was for me a game that while long (first playthrough took me 120 hours spread throughout a year), stroke a good balance of having content interspersed with good fluff. So far post-ARR seems to be working out well enough for me, but I’m afraid it might be a couple of years until I actually get to Endwalker.
                I picked the Titan thing because it's a particularly egregious example and I'm trying to go lighter on spoilers for newer content. But there are absolutely places in Shadowbringers and Endwalker where massive forward momentum for important characters and the plot in general screech to a wailing halt so that we can meet brand new people who don't matter and spent waaaaay too long, say, building robots in the desert with them instead of actually completing someone's story arc. 

Again, I'm not saying 14 is bad and I'm not saying it doesn't hit hard when things are firing on all cylinders. But to make the point that it doesn't feel like an MMO with a ton of filler quests in hubs to pad out the runtime is absurd.
                    They fixed this part in recent updates though I thought.
                        The specific thing I'm talking about in this post happens in Shadowbringers, so I doubt it. I know there was a pass at some point to cut down on some of the fluff in the really old content but I suspect they didn't get rid of all of it.
                            As someone who very recently finished ARR, it's still so slow and bloated (especially the patch quests) that it's almost hard to believe it used to be worse.
                    Yeah almost every major event is precluded by a lot of meaningless quests where you gather something or have to travel someplace to talk to someone else only to then fo back to the first place
            I haven't forgot it at all, trust me we FF14 fans remember it all too well lol (hell, the part in Return from Ivalice that's an ill-considered parody of the Titan questline was recently cut from the game because everyone hated that bit too).

But in a game that has spanned 9 years with 300+ hours of main story content and 100s of hours of side story content, the fact you're reaching for one of the earliest questlines in what is universally agreed to be the weakest part of the game that doesn't hold a candle to ShB and EW actually proves my point as much as anything.

And yeah I'm not claiming every single quest in that 300+ hours is a masterpiece, the pacing can be fairly slow at times and occasionally you can get quests that border on padding (level 88 Sharlayan...) but these moments pale in comparison to MSQ meaningfully pushing the story forward in some way or another.
                I like how you say "we FF14 fans" like I'm not one of you. I didn't beat Endwalker because I hate the game or the story. But people come out of the woodwork to chop your head off if you imply anything is wrong with the plot.

You could cut *a lot* out of it and it'd be exactly the same or better. I knew I'd get a ton of people trying to *got you* me by pointing out my example is old, but it absolutely still happens. I just don't want to fill my post with Shadowbringers spoilers because unlike ARR it's actually genuinely great sometimes and I don't want to ruin that for anyone.
            It's not even good pacing for an MMO. FF14 just has an amazing story that you have to do completely mundane stuff to progress. It could almost be billed as a whole new type of interactive storytelling experience. That's not to say the mmo aspects of the game aren't good, but they're only present in the questing portion of the game when it forces you to group up which honestly just annoys me at that point because I'm vibing on the story even though group play is why I started.
                This has been updated. They recently cut out many meaningless quests to make this part of the game more enjoyable.
                    I played through post-patch ARR recently, and while I wouldn't call many of the quests *meaningless* exactly, it's still wayyyyyy longer and slower than it needs to be, especially post-ARR/pre-Heavensward.
                    Yeah they cut some stuff but only so much that it went from absolutely absurd to slightly ridiculous.
            Which is from ARR, the worst part of FF14 and also not what he was referring to. He explicitly calls out 3 of the 4 expansions as being better stories. 

ARR needs to get a full revamp, it very much does not sell what kind of game the rest of the game is, which is a shame because it's most people's first taste.
        FFXIV is exactly like that. I played through arr and some of the bridge content before the first expansion. There were plenty of times I was doing grindy, repetitive stuff to level up so I could do the next main quest mission. It had more of a cohesive story than other mmo's, but it was very much still an MMO. And who can forget dungeon: the movie? I was grinding that for some cosmetic event with a friend and I swear we spent more time watching a movie than actually controlling our characters. 

And let's be honest, the story in arr wasn't really anything great. It was pretty standard stuff and predictable as hell. Compare that to other ff's and it just pales in complexity, character development, and originality. Maybe the expansions improved, but the core game was only a 7\10 at best for an RPG story. 

I could go on about what I think is the right and wrong way to do MMO stories, out what makes a good singlet player story vs MMO, but I won't.
            Are you of the impression that this is controversial? ARR is a solid "Ok.". It really is nothing more. 

Get through Shadowbringers and Endwalker, and I have now played the best story, characters both friends and villains, soundtrack and writing in all of FF. Possibly my favorite in all gaming.
            ARR is barely even the prologue of the game. FF14 dramatically changes in quality from Heavensward on. It's not considered the best mmorpg for nothing.
            Literally nobody talking about how good FF14 is refers to ARR. The guy literally said Heavensward, Endwalker and Shadowbringers.
            You played the worst bits of the game and didn't touch any of the actual stuff that FFXIV won a shit ton of awards for. Everyone agrees that there are a lot of low points in the game, but the highs are well up there, enough to make FFXIV in the top 3 of FF, even the best for many people.
                The worst bits of the game comprise the entire first 50-ish hours of mandatory content. I like FFXIV but I really can't blame anyone for dropping out during or right after ARR because it's boring, long, and mandatory. It's an extremely valid criticism of the game.
            I don't think many FFXIV will disagree with you that ARR's story was okay at best. However Heavensward, Shadowbringers and Endwalker are definiately what people will think of when they talk about FFXIV's amazing story. I'll say that FFXIV has hit a groove in 'how' they tell the story, but this 'how' isn't really for everyone.
            ARR is not what people talk about when they describe FFXIV as a really good story. And the game is nine years old and has very much learned from it's early iteration.
    I didn’t get that vibe from XV at all, it felt like a regular open world game - I think XV fucked up by releasing too early and splitting the story across 1000 mediums. I played Royal and loved it - but from what I’ve read the story is even MORE jumbled in the original and it was really disjointed feeling.
        I just plain stopped in the original.  Didn't remember a single thing that happened one day, had no attachment to a single character.  I just had no idea why I was playing.  I replayed the Royal and it definitely clicked more... that being said, I'm still not much of a fan.  The combat was super lacking, and the story needed a ton of editing.  And the game movement just took forever.  I got tired every time I hit a new zone.
    XV didn’t really fail as a whole. It sold really well and the general consensus is everything before the linear last 25% of the game was great. I remember me and a friend feeling like it was one of the best FFs we ever played…and then the linear ending happened.
        XV didn't fail but it probably did lasting damage to the brand being the second mediocre Final Fantasy after XIII (with XIV 1.0 wreaking havoc in the background where the single player fans couldn't see). It still had the "Versus XIII was the real game" hype behind it at release which was hype that started in a time when there was more reverence for the Final Fantasy franchise. XVI is the first one that has to deal with the consequences of XIII and XV's mixed reception.
            For the hard-core fans probably, but people don't like to admit that FF is a very broad appeal franchise, with the majority being casual fans.  It's the most mainstream JRPG by a wide margin.  Each mainline game just needs cutting edge graphics, and it'll sell like hotcakes
        The linear ending was annoying gameplay wise, especially not knowing you’d be stuck there till it’s over, but story-wise it really kicked the shit out of me lol

Though it’s nice they let you go back for endgame
    I was pretty hyped for the game after seeing the movie. You roll out into the open world in the car, go up to a gas station, and get a quest to go find beans.

Talk about disappointing.
        Seems pretty standard for the start of any RPG, can't be taking down bosses the size of gods asscrack right out of the gate, you gotta be collecting 10 bear asses and giving some herbs you found on the floor to old lady dithers to treat her back pain.
    Well good thing not even FFXIV is designed like that. And Yoshi-P has commented multiple times that FFXVI is like a fast paced roller coaster so that seems to go against what you are describing.
    I wouldn't worry about it. FFXIV team have mastered the craft of making an MMO feel like a jrpg rather than an MMO (complete with a full npc party system and basically a traditional JRPG structure to its story) so I'm sure they are fully aware that this game shouldn't just be FFXIV offline. With each new expansion the game felt less and less like an MMO with jrpg elements and more and more like a JRPG with mmo elements (in a good way) so I don't think they'll fall into that trap. 

FFXV also had huge development issues, the game was essentially developed in 2 years so they had to resort to MMO style quests to fill gaps. Same kind of situation as Dragon Age Inquisition's content.

REAL SHIT???
>With Yoshi P at the helm, the Heavensward writing team

I definitely got a lot of FFXIV vibes from the trailer and that now makes sense, I knew YoshiP was working on this but not the Heavensward writing team.
That's nothing. I'm a huge fan of XIII. Truly sick
    There are dozens of us! DOZENS!
There was just so much *heart* in FFXV that it excused pretty much every obvious shortcoming the game had for me and easily became one of my favorite FFs. It's a broken game but damn is it memorable. 

I'm keeping a close eye on Forspoken too because it's the same team, even though I fully expect the same kind of criticism to come up at release
    >I'm keeping a close eye on Forspoken too because it's the same team

Tabata made XV what it was. Forspoken is helmed by some western Hollywood-type writers, so I wouldn't expect the same.
Same. Feel-wise, FF15 might even be my favorite FF game. Yes the other games might have better combat systems you like, and most are finished and not rushed at the last half, but no other Final Fantasy game had made me feel sad about "no more adventures with my party" when the credits rolled. What FF15 did so much better than literally any other party-based RPG I've played (and I've been playing since NES) really makes you feel the bond between the party members. In many of the games your party is a group based on opportunity, you all have the same goal or similar direction of goals. But in FF15, you're a group of friends and they really nailed it.
    Man, I didn’t even know there was FF15 hate. That’s definitely my favorite FF game, personally. I loved the combat, characters, and settings so much. The story was whatever, but most FF games in the last 20 years have been that way. Doesn’t detract from how much fun that game was for me, though.
        i knew there was a decent amount of hate, but i think its mostly just cause its so different of a game from the classic FFs. doesnt appeal to the same type of person i guess
            The release hate was justified. The most complete edition (Royal edition I think?) adds so much content and extra context that I would say the game deserved a re-review. The base game was missing so much.
            >doesnt appeal to the same type of person i guess

Nah its more it just wasn't fleshed out enough, there brilliance under the surface but the game just skips past it.

For example a big moment should have been Ignis going blind, yet the how is completely skipped over devaluing the drama that comes from it.

XV is decent, better than some others in the series, but the development hell it went through absolutely marred the final product in a big way.
            In my experience the hate isn't due to any inherent negative with the gameplay, characters, or story. It's that they put the story out in a movie, anime, and other random places rather than in-game. Then rushed through the in-game story. Then to top it all off, canceled half the DLC which would have completed the story.
I beat XV when it was released. Now that I have the upgraded PS+ and I saw that it has the Royal Edition I have been thinking about picking it back up. I've heard Chapter 13 is a bit different than when I played it last.
    It is, and there's an option to play a shorter versio - it's moreso you switching every now and then from playing as Noct to playing as The Bros.
Boy band simulator XV is not a good game but it is fun to play. The atmosphere is just enjoyable.
Reddit is being it's usual contrarian self with regards to 15.  It had the most promise and intrigue of an FF since the golden PS1 era.  It had a very troubled development.  Nomura was trying to make the ultimate Final Fantasy.

And I don't want to be negative but everything so far 16 looks very basic.  Western kingdoms warfare with Kings/politicians and very generic character design (Nomura gets too much hate, but atleast his characters at this point in time are very iconic, and stand the test of time), combat built upon the backs of 15 and FF7R.  

In the end people can say what they want about it but 15 had *heart*.
You're probably joking, but SoP is likely my favourite game of 2022 so far. Even the story is great and later explains why Jack acts the way he acts. I always wonder if people who shit on it actually gave it a fair chance!
    Honestly even if the story is dumb like most people say, I think it looks fun. Just waiting for the steam release in another year or whatever.
        It's dumb in kind of a smart way (well, at least they try to make it so).   

There is a reason character interactions in the beginning are so weird and outlandish.
    tbh i don't think i'm even joking, mate. i tried the critically acclaimed ff14 and found it to be more a visual novel than a video game as the quests were atrocious and the early dungeons were in exercise in pressing 2-3 buttons on repeat. and all the good content seems to be an expansion or two in but i'm also told the story is a big part of the game and how i shouldn't skip it and i do not have the patience for any of it. 

but stranger of paradise? that is a video game, with gameplay, and it's fun in it's opening hours. a winner in my book.
I want a DLC for FFXVI where Jack appears and he Jacks all over everyone.
Hope we get a good sale for the holidays so I can finally play that gem.
True GOTY, the morbius of video games
Someone in the trailer says something about chaos, so I'm gonna go ahead and assume this is a direct sequel to SOP.
Chaos.
Oh, you are absolutely right; Ralph Ineson is also a good possibility. And yeah, the developers CBU3 having at least one *Game of Thrones*-actor per game is pretty much tradition at this point. The actors of Roose Bolton, Gendry, Aerys Targaryen, Yara Greyjoy among others have voiced in FFXIV. Maybe I need to also start watching *Bridgerton* to find if their actors are involved in FFXVI, considering the character Anthony played by Jonathan Bailey is also voicing in FFXIV.
    I don't know if it's SIDE or CBU3's English localisation director doing the casting and directing, but they've managed to strike absolute gold with most of the voices, which is amazing since a lot of the best performances are from actors without many credits to their name. Rene Zagger as Emet-Selch and Matt Stokoe as Elidibus give unparalleled performances.
100% Ralph. Bloody good rep
Thank you! I was trying to figure out why I recognized that voice! I saw The Witch a couple weeks ago. And I knew the voice in this trailer sounded familiar!
I had no interest in this game but if it is Ralph Ineson I might actually check it out.  I love just hearing that man talk dramatically.

Also near the end I think I heard another actor that I really enjoy his voice
Finchy!
Finchy! Bloody good rep.
Honestly I like the sound of that. There’s been several fantasy JRPG’s (including the last FF) that I’ve tried to pick up that I felt could have been amazing with a bit more grounding like you would see in some western media. I think Japanese fantasy is often better at embracing the truly fantastical and feel like you’re really seeing another world with different rules, but sometimes at the cost of feeling like you could live there and that everything doesn’t have to be quite so… Shakespearian maybe? The world and magic can be over the top without the characters being quite so artificial and theatrical I guess, which has been a problem with FF and why I just can’t seem to connect with the FF7 remake in the same way as the original despite loving the gameplay. On the other hand I think western stuff can get way to bogged down in the wrong details and can be too focused on being “gritty” and “realistic” to its detriment. I think both sides have their own strengths that set them apart, but I also feel that both could learn from each other in regards to their weaknesses. More than anything I’ve just wanted to see more fiction that meets somewhere in the middle.
Even in 1.0 and ARR you could see the GoT/ASOIAF influence.
2(?) trailers and very little gameplay. I think we'd be lucky for late 2023.
    Well they’ve said they are launching 2 unannounced live service games before the end of the fiscal year which is in March/April I believe. So they’re going to have to show them eventually along with their next slate of games. I believe God of War is the last game from their initial showcase for when they announced the ps5. They’ve seen to do announcements in waves and wait until all those games are out or almost out to announce the next phase.
I don't know if that's the reason, by there wss 100% going to be an event in october. Silent Hill 2, FF XVI trailer being announced the same day there were leaks for a trailer of Spiderman 2. Too many coincidences related to Playstation.
The entire gaming industry is fueled by so much pettiness that I can 100% believe that this is exactly what happened.

Or did we all forget that grueling phase in 2020 where both Microsoft and Sony basically tried to tiptoe around the prices of their consoles until literally 1-2 months before launch, waiting for the other company to reveal their price first?
Well the world does seem to have some Ivalician vibes... I can't even remember if the Ivalice in FFTA was the real one or not though.
    The art director for XVI, Hiroshi Minagawa, essentially created the look of Ivalice alongside Yasumi Matsuno. Minagawa was art director on FF Tactics and Vagrant Story, Co-director on FFXII.  There's a ton of Ivalice staff at CBU3 working on FFXVI, but he's arguably the biggest
It’s a day 1 for me because I'm a Final Fantasy whore
    Yeah I probably should have led with this as well lol
    This is the most apt description of me lmao. It’s insane how strongly this franchise is still kicking all these years later.
    I preordered Final Fantasy Explorers back in the day, AMA
        Same. I even own the Collectors Edition of World of Final Fantasy.
    Not to mention a Soken whore. I really want to see what the mad genius (and he is) can do with this canvas.
Pretty sure the English VA was done before the JP VA. So the OG language is English this time.
    It makes with the mouth animations lining up so well, and it just sounds like it was written in English rather than translated
I feel its fairly safe to say it won't be a day 1 release at this point. Silent Hill 2 just got announced for both PC and PS 5 and that was on day 1 of that games announcement. 

Unless they got some special contract with Square I think its safe to say this will be an exclusive for some time.
    The first trailer, during a [State of Play 2 years ago](https://youtu.be/tjji8NEW9lo?t=296), said that it will also be available on PC, but the [standalone trailer](https://youtu.be/CUY9beBLIKM?t=221) just says PS5. The last trailer and this one don't mention platforms at all. A simultaneous PC release is not guaranteed, but it's not completely out of the cards either.
        As I understand it, this was a error and they've stated FFXVI will not be releasing on PC, at least not on day 1.
    Probably going to be 1 year PS5 exclusive then 1 year Epic Games Store exclusive.
But Final Fantasy isn't a Sony product, it is released by Square Enix.
Yup, I've given up playing FFVII Remake since they refuse to release it on Xbox. I don't have a PC powerful enough for modern gaming.
They're developing a game that costs dozens (if not hundreds) of millions to make. When Sony comes knocking with a fat pay check that's probably worth dozens of millions Square Enix are never going to say no. [Same thing happened with Nintendo and Capcom for Monster Hunter Rise timed exclusivity.](https://old.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/kdmopd/nintendo_paid_around_6_million_for_monster_hunter/) And Microsoft do that too of course with Gamepass and other exclusive titles. 

We're never going to get out of this as long as the big 3 are willing to put so much money on the table for exclusivity, it's too good to pass up on it for studios. But Square Enix are by far the worst ones when it comes to that, they'll take the console exclusivity money, then they take the EGS PC exclusivity too.
Even without any exclusivity deal a PC port would likely arrive later. For quite a lot of Japanese games and developers the focus and priority is console, for me personally this is one of the reasons why I tend to prefer console when it comes to gaming.
    Yeah. PC market in Japan is non-existent. Heck, even Playstation and Xbox are on the mud. Only console fourishing there is the switch because of its portability. And mobiles.
>just

you say that like we get more than one good DMC/Bayo every couple years. High quality spectacle fighters are few and far between, while high quality JRPGs are fairly common.

I get that it's not what people come to Final Fantasy for, but as a fan of both genres I'd gladly take one in the underserved genre if it actually turns out well.
The lead combat designer here was poached from Capcom after working on DMCV. It *is* a DMC fighter.
Guess I've missed those, they are nowhere to be seen around the visible part of the reddit comment section.
    A lot of conversation about it happens over at r/JRPG and r/FinalFantasy.
I didn't mean story wise, I mean combat wise. I couldn't even tell how much of my damage and/or control was coming from the party, it seemed like I was doing most of the work and the rest were floating around waiting for a special double team combo, which made them a glorified weapon rather than a party member. I played the game for about 20 hours before moving on to something actually exciting to play.
I'm just kinda tired of the multiple-warring-countries in the background trope.  Feels way overused by now, and not just in Final Fantasys.
    Then in the end you find out all the events were manipulated by Badasss Badguy Sadchildhood, who summoned the God of Whatever, so the politics didn't even really matter.
Only thing I get from that trailer is that there is a protag, there is a rival, there is a romantic interest and there is an antagonist. And there are magic and mechas. I have not played VIII so that's as close as you get for a 1st impression.
What's the difference between a shitty $1 fast food burger, and a gourmet burger from a Michelin starred restaurant?
[removed]
okay so. I'm not disagreeing with you about the 16 trailer.  It didn't give much to really dig into beyond "new Final Fantasy, with good visuals, and good music, and good voice acting" which is all stuff we'd already gotten from previous trailers. Some minor world-building but nothing that really excites.

However your counterexample is kinda... bad? Like I watch that trailer and I don't really get anything. I recognize some things because I already know about FF8, but if I didn't then... there's two guys with swords, and there's a girl, and there's a big robot. I think motorcycles? And the music is pretty generic. If you're going to go with a bunch of disorienting quick flashes for your whole trailer they need to be things that leave me mouth open, reeling at the possibilities or the magnitude of what I've just seen. Works well for horror, or for things that have really out-there environments or character designs. Or bringing back a bunch of things I already know (preferably in new and changed ways). Basically it needs to do better than two guys, a girl, some motorcycles, and a bunch of feather transitions. That gives me nothing, except maybe that it looked really good at the time in which case hey we're back at the 16 trailer again.
[deleted]
Lol I’d probably prefer a fighting game with final fantasy summons over what’s been shown
I mean the defining trait of Final Fantasy from a marketing perspective as far back as the SNES days has been character design that permanently sears itself into your brain on first look. Every game from VI to XV (with the exceptions of XI and XII) have had at least one character that has become a pop cultural figure beyond the realm of video games from sheer strength of design alone. And the OP is right that these character design are taking cues from XII.
    I don't think we know confirmed details for the developers/designers for a lot of this game yet but Akihiko Yoshida (FF12 character designer) was the main character designer of the 3rd FFXIV expansion and along with Matsuno has been collaborating with YoshiP a lot recently.

He very well could be the character designer of FF16. There are of course rumors Matsuno is involved in the game too.
    > And the OP is right that these character design are taking cues from XII.

And what's the problem with that? Are you saying the character designs in 12 are generic? Lol

Not enough Bishonen kpop guys I guess.
It's always remarkable how people like to brush off someones genuine skepticism as just them making something up to be disappointed about.
It's valid criticism though. What's the issue with people having different opinions on the game?
The one bound has been in previous trailers wielding a rapier. She is the adopted sister of the main character. The chick in bed is the 2nd in command of the evil nation and one of the eikon warriors. J get the feeling she will swap sides after falling for one of the good guys in the story.
Yep it is very glaring when you notice it. Got some whiplash going from FF V, VI, VII, XIII.... then dropping into XV. I've only played like 5 of the 13 total Kingdom Hearts games, but I feel like it suffers from the same. Of the few main gals only Kairi mattered and she was relegated to being a damsel.
Yeah ff13 was like released 13 years ago. 15 starred 4 identical dudes and the first thing we saw in this trailer was that again. Followed by 5 or so male monarchs. So yes, these days, looks like it's just all men.
    Not true, look at FFXIV, the 3 main starting cities are all led by women, the group you are part of was led by a women too and in the group there were an equal-ish split of women and men. It changes over time but the pint still stands. 

As for FFXVI, because of the medieval setting it probably makes a lot more sense to have a male dominated cast but we've yet to play the game so we'll see.
And not day 365 either, since Square is going Epic first when porting stuff to PC nowadays.

Day 730 it is.
    [deleted]
    That actually seems to be changing, slightly - Triangle Strategy and FF7: Crisis Core are both releasing to Steam day-and-date with the Epic version.
>This looks no different than all the other gritty medieval fantasy JRPGs we've been seeing recently.



Give me a couple of examples that have similar level of fidelity. Would genuinely love to check those out.
    > fidelity

Well now we're talking about 2 different things. I'm talking about art direction, story, and characters. I'm sure in terms of "quality" it's miles ahead of anything else. It's SE's flagship JRPG after all.
        Sure, but are those other JRPG at least 3D? Fidelity is part of art direction, Triangle Strategy and GoT might be similar thematically, but still feel very different to me.

I was just wondering if there are games that look close to XVI, because it appeals to me a lot.
In the context of the series I'm glad to see a return to pure fantasy. I *love* fantasy mixes of steampunk, modern times, and whatever else but they haven't gone hard on fantasy like this since the 2D era. FFXIV is amazing but despite it being the most fantasy feeling one yet it still does go straight Sci-Fi quite often.
    Even the first Final Fantasy has robots and a space station.

Final Fantasy 4 is as much sci-fi as it is medieval European fantasy and it's awesome for it (it also throws ninjas and martial arts in the mix because it's [the rule of cool](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool)).
Here I am just wanting X vibes again.
    X-3 please
Am excited for XVI but completely agree with you. Hoping KH4 can scratch some of that itch (though it's definitely some years away from release)
    Absolutely, can't wait for KH4! Obviously still excited for this game but it just isn't grabbing me right now.
You have had your pseudo-modern fantasy sci-fi in FF13, FF15 and FF7 Remake. Geez, leave some for the rest of us that want some novelty in our lives.
TBH I wish they went all in on the grand political stuff.

FFXV to me felt like it didn't have much grand political stuff and the stuff it did have was pretty on the surface type stuff.
FF12 was 17 years ago. FF15 is definitely sci-fi fantasy. FF7 Remake is sci-fi steampunk fantasy. And the rest you mentioned are not even remotely related to FF.

We haven't had a regular fantasy experience in the singleplayer games in 17 years and you are oversaturated? This is ridiculous
buddy if FF15 is too "medieval" for you then I really don't know how an FF game could satisfy while still justifying the "fantasy" in its title.
    FFXV was definitely not the right vibe I was thinking of, I’m mostly remembering altissia being very cathedral-y apparently
It doesn't even seem like we'll written broody castle stuff tbh.
For sure.

I'd take a X-3 over anything else right now personally
FFVII and FFX got political too. VII with the greedy corporation and X with the religion.
I don't mind/love the setting, FFT was one of my favorite games after all, but this all looks and sounds generic. I'm not sure how this setup is any different from Square Enix's lower tier RPGs like Triangle Strategy and the like. They've made plenty of these kinds of games over the past few years themselves. This one just has higher production values (but not high enough to be worthy of the FF moniker, IMO, this series has always pushed the envelope w/ presentation).
    Definitely Triangle Strategy vibes from the "look at our many warring cultures: the normal one, the snooty one, the Arabic one..." bit.
The three Final Fantasy combat system since XIII are nothing like each other so I'm a bit confused about what you find bad in common about them.
    I would argue it actually goes back to 12, not 13. It's the idea that you pick one character and AI controls the rest. I'm not counting 11, because that's an MMO, but in 1-10 you control your whole party. From 12 to (seemingly) 16, you pick one character to control, and the AI does the rest. That "frees" them to make the combat more interactive. I put "frees" in quotations, because in practice it seems to actually just result in every character playing like a fighter, because the mages are best left to AI, since they require the least input, and the AI will control melee very suboptimally.
        Oh I'd totally agree it just felt like 12 was sort of a weird experiment that although it's easy to see how it inspired what came after it, was still different enough that I felt like I shouldn't say 12 and beyond, but honestly you're right.
        I found the opposite. If you left the AI in control of the makes then they would chew through your MP far faster than it would replenish. 7R didn't even bother having the AI use MP.
    [deleted]
        Yep agreed, and those were also some of my favorites (including Persona for me). I mean I don't begrudge them for changing the style and I'm not out here shaking my fist saying they need to go back; if it's making them more money etc. that's just the way things evolve sometimes and I get that, it's just personally I'm not a fan.
I put a huge list below but the early arts were pretty andro for most protags, but usually when they reappear in games like Dissidia they look better.

Except for Bartz. He really went for the full David Bowie, eye-liner, andro supreme look.
7, 10, 15 all have pretty boy protagonists. Maybe 12 if you consider Vaan the protagonist but he's really young and Basch doesn't fit that description. 

As for the rest I'm thinking about it and 6 and 13 have clearly female protagonists, I wouldn't call Squall androgynous, 9 has a goofy art style that doesn't make anyone look androgynous, 11 and 14 are MMOs. 

All of Amano's characters look extremely androgynous but 1-5 are old enough that the pixel art doesn't really capture his art style that well.
    Vaan's the guy you walk around as outside of combat, so I'd definitely call him the protag, as much as there is a single one.  And I certainly wouldn't call Squall or Zidane "dudely."
        Yeah if the question is just whether or not the characters are dudely then zidane and squall definitely don't qualify as dudely. Squalls got enough edgy bad boy vibes so he doesn't seem androgynous to me and Zidane is like a weird monkey boy who I wouldn't call manly but he's very boyish.
        >Vaan's the guy you walk around as outside of combat

He's the errand boy
        He was added post Matsuno basically as the character the player could identify with instead of a dude in his mid 30s - I can't remember if Basch or Balthier was meant to be the player character early on. Everything rotates around Ashe though.
            Basch was the original main
7, 8, and 9 are the big ones. 15 not quite so much but still firmly in pretty-boy territory.
Yeah I can't think much about that either. Tidus is perhaps not really beastly, but Squall is mannish, Cloud has a pretty face but obvious man muscles. I guess Vaan? But he's also mostly a child.
    Vaan kind of has an excuse too, the execs wanted a young relatable main lead so they shoehorned him in, which is why he kind of just feels like he's tagging along on the journey and basically stops being the main character 5 hours in.
Vaan from ffxii comes to mind.
I'm still sad that Matsuno's stuff in 14 wasn't that well-received and Matsuno fans won't get another taste.

Ishikawa's stories are a bit too character driven for my taste.
The politics as they presented it thus far looks even less interesting than the trailers for Triangle Strategy or Diofield.
Really? The trailer mentions Rosaria and Dalmasca so I was hopeful...
To quote the ESRB:

> This is an action game in which players assume the role of students fighting to protect their nation from invaders. Players traverse fantasy environments and battle enemy soldiers and other creatures in melee-style combat. Players use swords, bows, firearms, and magic spells to kill various enemies (e.g., robots, blobs, mechanical beasts). Battles are accompanied by realistic gunfire, screams of pain, and large blood-splatter effects; some sequences depict blood stains on players' screen and corpses lying in pools of blood. Cutscenes depict additional acts of violence: a man stabbing himself with a sword; a girl shot by a sniper; a character shot close-up. During the course of the game, some female characters are depicted in outfits that expose large amounts of cleavage and jiggling breasts. In one sequence, players can use a spy camera to zoom in on a female character wearing a bikini. The game includes event scenes in which a character sedates/drugs players' character and performs unknown acts on them; it is implied that some of these acts may be of a sexual nature.
    If you told me this description was for Fire Emblem, I wouldn't question it.
        Doesn't get that much breast and cleavage in Fire Emblem Three Houses
            Nah, but Heroes more than makes up for it
    Aiit I'm preordering this game now. 😭 These ratings just sold me.
        I'm pretty sure that's for Final Fantasy Type-0, not FFXVI
In Type—0 at the end of each battle you steal your enemies souls as they’re vaporized into a cloud of red mist… the game has a lot of scenes that are pretty violent and bloody.
[removed]
    They're talking about Type-0 I'm pretty sure
        Yep!
It WAS M rated though... Also had the first FF f-bomb
    also had the first FF Limp Bizkit-bomb
    That was an awesome scene, too.

People can say what they want about that game.  It knows what it's about.
        It was about stopping chaos?
Rated C for CHAOS!!
Theres a LOT of dark themes in 14, that i am surprised that still T, i cant imagine what more stuff Yoshi P and team will created if the game was rated M.
    Endwalker has two scenes in a particular zone that I still can't believe are in a T rated game.
        Yeah, >!dunno how they got away with some dude putting a gun in his mouth and pulling the trigger with a T rating tbh.!<
            Yoshi-P's team has mastered the art of "implying but not showing" in FFXIV. You never actually seen the guy put the gun in his mouth, but the audience could put two and a two together within the context.
            A guy shot himself on-screen in Insomniac's Spider-Man and that got a T.
    They said they wanted *that* scene in Shadowbringers to not happen while obscured but couldn't because of the T rating
        Which scene was this?
            Poor Tesleen.
The keyword here is implication
As long as they don't say that's what happened all's good

But a wink wink nudge nudge doesn't hurt
Interesting. Square Enix invested a lot in the Luminous engine, and it was surprising to see FF7R use Unreal instead of their own, presumably very costly, engine.

Luminous definitely still has the potential to bring consoles and PC's to their knees, and FFXV still looks great. I thought SE has given up on their engine but perhaps there's more life in it with FFXVI
    They're using Luminous for Forspoken. Looks basically exactly like 15
If it helps FFXIV is designed around *not* keeping you addicted. The devs literally said they want players to just play for a bit every new patch, then return back to other games. There's no daily logins, they dont remove content and its designed so old content is always active, and they're even adding the ability to just play through the main story with an NPC party over other players. You can basically just play through it as a singleplayer game by design.
    Came to say this! I signed up summer of 2020 so I could mentally survive the pandemic and its been one of my best gaming choices ever. No pressure.
        Me and my friends joined just before the pandemic kicked off and its been a wild ride. I already enjoyed the game but once I reached shadowbringers it became an all-time classic rivalling the rose-tinted glasses of the other games. Endwalker launch was a special time for me too, theres a great feeling of community running along the main quests with all the other players, and its great just being able to pop on a few times a year to catch up on content rather than feeling obligated to be on every single day.
            Endwalker was my first time being truly caught up to MSQ. There's a certain *je ne sais quo* about going through an area and seeing two dozen people in the same innocuous spot, all watching a cutscene.

I sped through the entire expansion in a week, and to this day I still think >!Ultima Thule is one of the most beautifully haunting area in the game, if not in games period.!<
                That last walk was one of the heaviest things I’ve seen from a game.

        there is a free trial you can play the base game and first expansion up to level 60. I hear it's critically acclaimed....
            Specifically speaking the trial takes you through one of the best story arcs in the game with the Heavansward expansion, it will give you a really good idea if the game is something you want to continue
        It does
        > Does it still require a monthly subscription?

The game has multiple expansions

A Realm Reborn > Heavensward > Stormblood > Shadowbringers > Endwalker.

You get to play ARR and HW for free, which should last you about 200 hours. ARR is a bit slow, but HW has a great story.
            Another note is that if you buy Endwalker you get all the previous expansions with it. Only ever need to buy the latest expac, and you get all of them.
                But if you buy the game keep in mind that you can't access the trial anymore. So you should play until lvl 60 and finish heavensword and then buy the game
    It'll just take half a year of casual play to catch up.
        Nothing to really "catch up" with if your main draw is the campagin. Just go at it at your own pace and enjoy one of the best rides in video games.
            Yeah been playing it at a pretty slow pace for over a year and am at Endwalker, been an incredible experience and I'm really glad I haven't rushed myself.
            Sure but when you have friends talk you into it like most of the time when you get into an MMO and everyone's excited about this new expansion coming or that new patch and then it's like cool but in a year and a half you can be there.
        The thing is, unlike WoW, the "real game" game isn't at the end. The game is the journey as well as the destination. It's amazing.


You can even join a guild (Free Company) and they can *join you* in the biggest moments, their levels getting synced down without making the content completely trivial for people who haven't seen it a million times. It's just a really fun game that goes on and on and on. ...Once you get through most of ARR. Ooph.
            I agree the story experience is breathtaking, but even then the actual gameplay during questing is somehow even less engaging than leveling usually is, and I could not stand how on one hand the game was constantly making me disband my party to do certain quests but then on the other hand would make me join other big parties to do others, and some of those big group quests would be brain dead dungeons or they'd be challenging raids that you actually needed to study up on to get past. It's like I had to both care and not care more than I wanted to the whole time.

But again when you really were into the story it's like you could've dropped all the gameplay and just traveled from story beat to story beat. Whatever quests had you actually do felt like afterthoughts.
                Oh 100%. One of the things I miss from WoW is how clever and variable the quests got over time. Still simple stuff, but different.


14 has some neat stuff but it comes later on in the form of solo duties, and those and few and far between. Many agree basically solo boss fights. There was one brilliant and memorable one in Endwalker, though.
                I think the core problem is the first 2 expansions, despite their attempts to fix them (it’s been over a year for me, maybe 2?) are a real slog story wise IMO.

So unless you can skip through it but still get the story to lead into the other stuff it’s a big ask for a casual player. But they’re doing something right so my archmchair analysis is worth less than a grain of salt.
        > It'll just take half a year of casual play to catch up.

Way more. The main campaign that gets you to max level alone is what, 600 hours long?

I no lifed it last year, from ARR to the end of Endwalker, and it took me 2 months to finish it.

But the MSQ is the game's strongest point by far so that's fine. It's a fantastic story.
            It really is.
    when is that npc update out you think?
    > You can basically just play through it as a singleplayer game by design.

That's because it is a single player game at its core. 

After reaching EndWalker, I can say this game feels like a 300 hours cinematic where you occasionally kill mobs and rarely group with other players.
    > There's no daily logins

Are you sure you played the game? There's both daily and weekly grinds, golden saucer, and a bunch of other random stuff with daily/weekly caps.
        Oh, there’s always something you can spend your time on, but none of it is mandatory. You can always get caught up in short order if you step away for a time.
            Same is true for WoW as well. Return at the start of a new patch and you have a bunch of catchup mechanics.
I'm a 14 year WoW refugee. Zero regrets. No addiction (except the "addiction" of wanting to play any games you look forward to), but I don't feel like I'm missing out if I don't play for a week.
    The problem with FF14 with me is that the game require a monthly sub, and I would feel guilty if I only play 2-4 hours a week. Hence I swore it off instead of trying to play for the sake of playing.

That is why I like GW2 better...I can quit for six years and still be ready to go through end game content cause GW2 gears don't become obsolete.
        I usually just put FF14 off for a few months and come back when there’s a few major patches of content to get through. I don’t really see it as an MMO you keep coming back to every day. At least unless you really love the world and get sucked into every side activity. 

Even the endgame’s progression is very short once you’re there, so it doesn’t feel like you need to stay subscribed for months.
        Sure--that makes total sense to me.

I've also been a Final Fantasy fan since the original in the 80s, though, so 14 was an easy and nostalgic sell for me when I transitioned.
I feel like we’ll all be in for a treat with 16 because Soken really hasn’t missed in 14.
Here is Soken. Bow before his majesty. https://youtu.be/shWBppGY5G4
I mean, if u like singleplayer rpgs then ff14 is a great choice. the mmo stuff is optional. Its just another final fantasy game with some multiplayer elements. They are even making it so that you can do the whole story without interacting with other players.
I turn off the battle music, just gets in the way of the nice area themes. Especially the night ones.
No. I was pointing out that since the person above me liked the music in the trailer they might want to check out the music in 14 because that’s the same composer.
"I really like coke!"

"Wow I can't believe you're hating Pepsi like that"
There were a Morbol and a Coeurl in the initial reveal trailer, at the very least.
okay but I don't. Really believe that. I don't think that this game is going unreleased through a year and a half of QA without there being any significant parts of it they're unsatisfied with. Performance issues are currently my frontrunner and would be a very strong reason for not showing off anything besides cutscenes \~9 months out from release. I am aware of what Yoshi P prefers but a comprehensible 15 straight seconds of what the game actually looks like to play or any of the things you do in it besides Hit A Guy is not spoilers. It's not necessary for FFXIV trailers because everyone already knows how that game plays because it's been out for almost a decade.
    It's spoilers for him because he already said there will be characters who will be with the MC when he goes to different places. So what does that mean? If he shows a trailer with the protagonist with other people that makes it already a spoiler because people will have an idea what will happen on when and where.

That's enough of a spoiler for him.

Also I think you should know that the game was supposed to release this year but SE moved it back just for Forspoken.
It feels almost Gamecubey to me? But obviously extremely modern and polished.

I think it's the lack of shadows/depth in character models that makes it feel almost like 3d modern characters but on a flat plane. I get the same thing with From Soft games though.
    Could it also be that their irises don't move completely like humans? If you look at [Cindy](https://youtu.be/8PMDFu9d83Y?t=446) in FFV15,  she has the big eye movements to change what she's looking at but not the little flicks (saccades) that actual people do. Compare for example [Kingsglaive](https://youtu.be/UblcNFVVHT8?t=51), and the fact that the pre-rendered cutscenes in FFXV do have them.

Their movements are also a little stiff outside of fighting, anytime they walk, run or gesture it's somewhat exaggerated. Although that might be intentional so it adds to the feeling of dynamism. 

Also the fact that their faces don't deform that much when they move. Compare [Ellie's facial expressions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-iZiuT0zPU) in The Last of Us Part II even in the still-posed Model Viewer, she has cheek creases and brow creases and her hair moves realistically.  

Actually compare Noctis and >!Sid!< from FFXV [in the same scene alone](https://youtu.be/8PMDFu9d83Y?t=467). >!Sid!<'s irises still don't move, but >!his!< whole face is full of wrinkles and creases that are moving and giving a lot of detail. In comparison, Noctis only moves his eyes, cheeks and lips a little, and no wrinkles in sight. Even more true for their hands, arms, tight-fitting clothing, etc..

(No shade by the way, just observations.)
Just as god intended
> FFXVI will be the first Final Fantasy-title to utilize English as its original language

I didn't know that! That actually explains why the English voice acting is so good! I speak Japanese and always prefer Japanese for anime/games, but FF16 is the first time I've felt the English VA is better.

When the first trailer came out I was shocked by how good the English voice acting and lines were. I was even telling my friend they were so good that I felt like the lines had been written in English first then translated to Japanese afterwards, rather than the other way round that it is for every other game. I'm actually impressed with myself that I was able to tell lol
Yeah, especially later on in the story Urianger is a a joy. They turned "generic scholar who speaks fancy" into "bookworm nerd who spends so much time studying old tomes that he cant speak properly, so everybody gives out and makes fun of him for it". One of my favourite characters.
    I'm glad they doubled down on him and Y'stola.  They're two if the better written characters in FF history.  They both start out generic, but you really get to know them as time goes on.  And tbh, they don't really change that much, you just understand why they're the way they are, which is amazing writing.  Less Flanderization, more depth.
        It's hard to single out most of the main party but I'd probably throw Thancred in there too. Starts off as the "cool playboy" type and really gets some fantastic depth by the end of Shadowbringers.
            Special mention to Alphinaud throughout Heavensward. He was ablittle shit in A Realm Reborn, but he grew into a far more likeable person by the end. His growth as he became more humble was well done.
                Hell Alisaie too. She went from being stuffed into a highly optional raid series to being her own character who stands apart from her brother.
                    Oh yes, getting to spend more time with her was one of the best parts of Stormblood.

But Alisale wasnt ablittle shit like her twin lol
                        It was honestly the highlight for me. I love both the twins now, they really balance each other out. It was great finally getting to know her. They're really playing the long-form format well, having minor characters reappear from years ago to become lead roles, >!and also having leading characters retire to side ones as they do their own things!< really makes the world feel alive and natural. Its the same reason One Piece feels like such a grand adventure.
            From Playboy Thancred to Depressed Dadcred
            The stuff with him and Ryne is so so fucking good. Maybe my absolute favorite moment in ShB is the scene with him in the graveyard though.
    Absolutely in my top 3 as well. Pretty well every scene he's in during later expansions is impeccably written and acted.
I think the reason why Urianger speaks in old English is because in the Japanese version he speaks very formally. To localize it, the team decided to make him speak in Shakespearean like English and it added charm to Urianger.
    [deleted]
        Dragon Quest does this, it actually tends to work pretty well.
        I know Xenoblade 2 used accents to highlight where a character came from. The Blades typically had an American accent (from metropolitan to valley girl to high school venacular), people from the more agriculturally focused Gormott had Welsh accents, or the people from Mor Ardain had Scottish accents. This feature sort of carried on in Xenoblade 3 (since it follows XC1 and 2).
        Final Fantasy IX had a great localisation IMO which used different accents etc (although obviously it's not voiced).
    Also back in 1.0 he has a pretty wild storyline that the olde English played into. Urianger recognized the obscure prophecy van Darnus was using as a road map for Project Meteor... so he traveled around reciting those exact prophecies to distract van Darnus so he(?)° didn't notice the Circle of Knowing working on stopping Project Meteor. It worked great, and it's a pity there are no callbacks to this in Garlean related content later on.

°English localization screwed up here, long story short in Japanese Nael was female from the start but her gender was never explicitly mentioned; you can do that in Japanese without it being suspicious like avoiding all gender references would be in English. Localizers assumed the enemy commander was male. That's why the dialogue in Coils is so bizarre; the localizers skip the *obvious* Samus reveal explanation for "him" being a woman and go for Bahamut changing Nael's gender for... reasons. This was later retconned further to a female relative stepping into the original Nael's armor after his death.
Thanks for your reply, really interesting info! I did play XIV from about 1.16 all the way through to Stormblood but I didn't know a lot of this background info about the team.
Apparently the dialogue was written in English originally, so the Japanese VAs are using translated lines. They sound "off" for the same reason every English dub of anime sounds off, it's at least partially due to the translations. It all makes sense to me now lol
    16 is done by the same team as 14, and 14's localization is an interesting one. That one is done in Japanese first, but the English localization is so well-done that even a good chunk of Japanese players prefer it to the original Japanese. 14's JP script isn't bad, but it's kind of generic fantasy in some places; it's really more of a testament to just how beloved the EN localization is.

So now with 16, I believe it was reported that they did all the English voice work *first* and then translated it back into Japanese, with 14's much-beloved head of localization Michael-Christopher "Koji" Fox being the Localization Director for 16 as well.
When you know which clip they're referring to before even clicking on the link...
Do you know LA HEE? I sure do.
I'm going to need some context here. That was....something else.
    Soken usually does a goofy performance during Fan Fests.

In 2016 he [played](https://youtu.be/KwKUnJ2yO7s) a dungeon theme using two instruments and then just kicking a cardboard box.
    FFXIV's third expansion, Shadowbringers, has a day time track called "Civilizations" for one of its six zones. Pretty much from day one when the expansion released the "LA HEE" got memed hard and still does to this day. The FFXIV team does fanfests every two years (usually used as a staging grounds to tease and announce the next expansion) where they do loads of stuff for and with the playerbase.

The clip you're confused about is from the fanfest 2021, which would have normally been three separate ones spread over the late fall 2020 to early spring 2021 in Japan, the US and Europe but due to the pandemic they streamed it. One of the sections was about several of the ingame tracks of the game, either played on piano, by the game's own band (THE PRIMALS) or by the man, Masayoshi Soken, himself like the video linked above. Basically a giant love letter to the community, showing that pretty much every part of the development team is in tune with the community.

At another part of the fanfest, the team did another homage to a meme where [members of the dev team danced to the live version of the "A Long Fall" track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6tEi-6BLsw) that plays [during one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NApxz5bSl20) of the [Shadowbringers dungeons.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9QD25nakt8) The different colors of the shirts stand for tank (blue), healer (green) and DPS (red) - representing a dungeon group.
    This is from the fan festival in 2021, where the devs put on a convention to celebrate the game. There's often a bunch of announcements, events, and as you see here, a concert. 2021 was fully remote due to COVID.

The singer, Soken, is the main composer of FFXIV and is very highly regarded. This was one of the songs in the concert, which was a cover of a [overworld theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ascfjJXDWjo). One of the lyrics in the theme is La Hee, which has become a meme in the FF community. 

So basically, this legend walks on stage with no preamble, goes "Do you know La Hee?" and starts to sing... that. It was hilarious.
    To add on to the rest of the context: 

Soken's always had a silly side where he's not afraid to go on stage and act the fool to put on some truly memorable performances, but this particular FanFest (where the above took place) he announced that he'd spent much of the pandemic secretly working from the hospital where he was being treated for cancer. He only told as many people as he had to in order to make the working arrangement possible and asked that they keep it secret from the rest of the development team, so that he could work as "normally" as possible. 

He went on to say that his cancer is completely in remission and that the thought of the fans enjoying his work got him through the experience. So in addition to his general silliness, I think there's a hefty dose of "I'm still alive to be able to do this!" thrown in there as well.
    It's Civilizations from the [Rak'Tika Greatwood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ascfjJXDWjo) zone in FFXIV, Soken wanted to perform it himself as he originally intended it.
The dude's range is absolutely bonkers. From bangers like [Under the Weight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WR1-pds8qM) to "this should be in every music to relax to playlist" like [Sultana Dreaming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG-BIMPtC9k) (Uldah Night Theme).
    I was fortunate enough to play FFXIV for many hours with a good friend.

Later, during a particularly difficult part of my life I rediscovered Sultana Dreaming, I absolutely broke down sobbing, it felt like home. Like being safe around good friends with peace in your heart.

Whenever I listen to it to this day I still am comforted in a way that is difficult to describe.
    or when he remixes an old song and does.. [amazing things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsX6nxwCZ1o)
I'm gonna say it. For me, he's surpassed Uematsu. I'm more of a rock music kinda guy, so Soken starting from that as his square one means his tracks often just hit the tone better for me.
No Valse di Fantastica?
    I was just listing off the top of my head!
Well that's because he's no longer the sole composer of the game and others joined over the time as well. Soken is fantastic, but other composers like Daiki Ishikawa and Takafumi Imamura deserves as much credit as Soken, too
    (Some minor spoilers for Endwalker below via song titles)

For those unaware, Ishikawa and Imamura were responsible for (or heavily involved in) creating such songs as: The Black Wolf Stalks Again, Your Answer, the Sharlayan daytime theme, the Ktisis Hyperborea theme, and the Endwalker dungeon boss theme, and several of the dynamis themes.

Soken probably still deserves the lion's share of credit for building FFXIV's musical identity, but his team are fantastic composers and arrangers in their own right.
        The remixes in Endwalker of other expansion songs were great at repurposing the vibes of the original songs with adding new character to them.  Really well done by those composers and the team.
ff14 wasn't for me but that soundtrack is killer
the two horsemen of bangers every patch: soken and yu peng chen

we need to find two more consistent sources of every patch a banger so we have the four horsemen though
that's great to hear. The Last Remnant was probably the only singleplayer RPG they made where you felt like exploring an actual world with good fantasy elements and having an actual team at your side in the entire PS3 era of Square Enix
    The Last Remnant was a middling game that was severely weighed down by its confusing explanation (or lack thereof) regarding the combat and party systems that was perhaps a little *too* RNG and automated, because in the end you're only influencing the battle.

However, it's really unfortunate that people almost never give the world, races, art and music of The Last Remnant the time of day because of how under the radar it is. It's full of concepts that are so cool and a lot of them are executed very well... it's just actually playing the game where half of the time I'm scratching my head or beating it against a brick wall. I agree with you, and I am excited for FFXVI, but still..

Further pissed off that the Remastered version of the game looks graphically far superior and is a great remaster, but is locked to console at max 1080p (because it came out before PS4 Pro) with no patch, and they REMOVED the prexisting PC version from all digital storefronts with no announcement or hint whatsoever that we'll get a port of the remaster.
        I’ve had this game in my steam library for ages. Is this some kind underperforming inferior version? I know nothing about it other than buying it ages ago.
            The PC version is perfectly fine, it runs very well and works right out of the box with controllers too (you may have to switch to controller control setting and max the graphics first). Funnily enough, it was considered probably the only good JRPG port on PC for years upon years despite the game itself not being hot.

The remastered version on console moves it to Unreal Engine 4 and honestly it's very impressive how much of UE4 they shoved into it without it looking like a rush job. And it also adds a super-sprint mode that lets you run in the overworld sections MUCH faster... that's it.
        The PC port doesn't really run at 4k either so you're not missing anything. I have both, the console versions have better lighting while the pc version has better framerates.
    Game was terrible, but had a cool world and ideas that were executed poorly.
The Last Remnant was great, though
Oh shit I loved last remnant. Nice
SQEX is pulling out all the stops by bringing out their Aces.
    They probably have to, in order to restore faith in the series after how FFXV was (understandably) received.
        I liked FFXV!

Bad Final Fantasy game but great camping with your buddies simulator.
            Ffxv is a interesting “failure”. For like every part it does well there’s 3 parts that are poorly developed.

But I think it’s the best FF game to establish the party as a real group. As opposed to a band of characters joining together for a common goal. Like they really were friends and it was obvious.

The campfire scene in the end of the game I think is a payoff worthy of getting through some of the slog that is the game.

Great world, lore, just poorly connected and told. I would love for them to redo it one day the way properly.
            I really like it too but they pretty blatantly gave up on the game/world halfway through their DLC plans. I think we ultimately got 4/7 character DLCs and one ok MP DLC. There's quite a bit of that story they deliberately left out.
            FFXV flirting with magical realism for its world is infinitely more interesting to me than the drab fantasy world for FFXVI.  I don't fault anyone for liking it though and wanting a return to that type of setting given it's integral to the series' history.
        > after how FFXV was (understandably) received.

And FF13, and FF13-2, and FF13-3, and to some extent FF12.   
They really need to restore people faith in mainline non MMO Final Fantasy games.
    And keeping Nomura well the fuck away.

That gives me hope.
        Some of you act like Nomura killed your families.
            In another timeline he might have!!
                He kills your family in a random card battler side game off the main series
                    that ends up being pivotal to the plot for the next decade
                I bet it was actually his nobody Romnuxa traveling between worldlines with the power of waking. Easy mistake to make
                Underrated comment. Next thing you know, Donald and Goofy will show up!
            My family died in the pouch and zipper wars so he did.
            Nomura didn't kill my family, he just won't leave my damn house.
        >Game has nothing to do with Nomura, he's not even remotely involved

reddit: GRRR NOMURA
            Nomura is writing the last 2 books of ASOIF? The delayed release makes so much sense now...
        Nomura has had some kind of creative input in nearly every single good thing that Square Enix has ever created.

Why the hate?
            Nomura to me is like Zack Snyder, dude is really good at what made his name (Nomura a character designer, Snyder was a director of photography) but when they started to get director roles, that's when it got meh.

I think that the first 2 KH games are good, but that's it. Everything else that he was involved as a director is sub par, but when he gets to just design things, he does a good job.
                kingdom hearts is really the only series he's directed, sans the f7 remake, but he wasn't responsible for the unpopular changes to its narrative despite people thinking it. even seems like most don't realize how much he contributed to the original

his work as producer/concept creator also extends to twewy and stranger of paradise, both of which are good!
                    TWEWY’s design is top notch
                I don’t even think he’s a bad director per se, but he reminds me a bit of George Lucas where he needs someone to keep his ideas in check. I love KH1 and 2, along with the VII remake, and he’s not the primary writer on any of those. He’s got a good eye for visual flair, generally fun gameplay decisions and can come up with some interesting plot points, but he needs a good writer and producer to reign him in or it just goes off the rails and becomes too much.
I wouldn't completely count out the FFVIIR team. Regardless of the story direction, there is a lot of good things with the remakes in terms of presentation, graphics, characters and gameplay.
    Oh I absolutely love how they handled combat and materia progression in that. Like Character swapping alone in general. After YEARS of struggling from Square Enix to get a mix of traditional FF and action combat right. All I could think was how some other action-JRPGS would have totally benefited from that concept alone (*freaking Xenoblade Chronicles!!!).*

But to it's degree, it's a Remake of something that came before and not something new and unique at the time. FFXIII, and especially FFXV could have been treated a hell of a lot better. So unfortunately it had to be a Remake to get people back on Square's Side...or it was fantastic story/world building of a MMO that got people like me to glance at single Player Final Fantasy once again. Hence why I'llstill state that Yoshi P and Creative Business Unit III seem to be last bastion of people that want Final Fantasy to be new and unique once again. But we'll see when FFXVI lands.
    I'm hoping they're learning from their mistakes. FF7R really was an enjoyable game that I could not put down. I usually don't finish most games I buy tbh.. So to me its a really good game. definitely can name flaws, but the pros definitely outweighed the cons.
        It feels to me that Square has tons of talented people out in their company, but has difficulty reigning them in and making them focus. I think sometimes it is a clash of creative egos (which happens a lot in creative spaces, music, film, animation, etc.), sometimes it is mismanagement by the guys in charge, lack of understanding of certain technologies (i.e. FFXIII), or sometimes it is having too grand of a focus that is difficult to translate to a game (i.e. KH3, FFXV/VSXIII). FFXIV was successful partially because Yoshi P and his team found that the 1.0 team, though talented lacked focus and that sometimes caused chaos.
    Square Enix has a ton of amazing talent they just have difficulty focusing it. Yoshi P's biggest achievement was focusing the talent of the FFXIV team so hopefully he can work his magic from the start here.
The reason FFXV failed was because of everything happening in the background in development, there was no consistency and it was sort of a rush job. All things considered it's a miracle it turned out the way it did. This game does not have anywhere near the baggage
    Nowhere was it more apparent that it was a rush job than that town you go to for Leviathan. That town was *way* too developed for it to be a one-off quest area, it was clearly intended to be another town you could regularly visit, maybe even a second hub, but all of that was casted aside. 

Imagine what XV could have been like if it was led by the XVI team. The same graphics, the same exploration, the same combat system (which, honestly, is deeper than most people give credit for), but done in a way that doesn't just feel like a road trip with the bros. 

[I still think back to when XV was originally called XIII Versus.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6At_bb1PNU)
        Agree completely. The game was terrific until then. Terrible after
    Rush job? That bitch got started and restarted like a dozen times and took forever to actually come out. Don't forget XV started as part of a threesome of games that was supposed to be XIII
        Yes, and the last build was a rush job. That's what I meant by that.
XII was the "singleplayer MMO". And now, especially with the Zodiac Age version, its pretty well-received.
    XII was ahead of its time in many ways.  The few tweaks with Zodiac Age keeps the game feeling extremely modern.  Like if you told me Zodiac Age on switch was a new game released last year, I would believe you.
    It was mixed amongst fans.  It wasn't bad per se, but it definitely wasn't everyone's cup of tea.
        Definitely mixed - it’s actually my personal favorite. Depends on who you ask
FFXV failed for me because the combat was trash and the story required too many extra-curriculars.
    > and the story required too many extra-curriculars

To date, it's the only mainline FF that requires those extra-curriculars to comprehend the story in full. No other FF does this.
I mean, FF14 isn't like that at all. Its story lives up to and eventually (Heavensward, Endwalker and especially Shadowbringers) even surpasses the peaks of single player FF. The common line is 14 is a traditional JRPG with a MMO tacked on to the endgame when you finish the story.
    Ahh how soon we forget the several hours of quests where you have to gather supplies to throw a party for yourself before you're allowed to fight Titan.

Like, 14 has narrative high points for sure. But its pacing is pretty wack by nature of it being an MMO and it is inarguably 'like that' as you put it.
        It's a little disingenuous to use their earliest content as the benchmark for CBU3 instead of the all recent stuff that they've won piles of awards for. There are of course obvious limitations to the gameplay and storytelling as a consequence of FFXIV being built on a decade old MMO, but the real meat of FFXIV's story succeeds on it's own merits. You could rip it all out of the MMO and build a (very long) singleplayer mainline title out of it with minimal adjustments (Mostly just getting rid of the filler quests), and it would still be phenomenal.
            >You could rip it all out of the MMO and build a (very long) singleplayer mainline title out of it with minimal adjustments

People really underestimate how long the MSQ is. People regularly complain about JRPGs breaking the 40 hour mark, and that includes gameplay. FF14 is over 20 hours of cutscene time \*per expansion.\*

[https://www.reddit.com/user/Cyberfunk3/comments/y5gauf/ffxiv\_tracker\_62\_update\_improved\_formatting/](https://www.reddit.com/user/Cyberfunk3/comments/y5gauf/ffxiv_tracker_62_update_improved_formatting/)

A quick eyeballing of time says I 100%'d the Pixel Remasters of 1 through 4 (\~115 hours) in less time than it takes to watch cutscenes in FF14 (\~123 hours). That's watching the extended version of the LotR trilogy 10 times, and still leaving time for bathroom breaks! If you could play all of the MSQ cutscenes sequentially without having to do dungeons and walk places between them, you'd be able to put the controller/mouse down for \*five days.\*

This is tolerable when you're playing it as it comes out, but don't undersell how gargantuanly long the story is, or how much of an advantage the MMO format breaking up these story sections over literal years helps.
                Yeah I recently created an alt and just finished the 2.0 content. Sure the story content itself is about 20 hours, and I'm honestly okay with that, but I broke it up with a *lot* of side content. I leveled all my crafters, did every blue quest I came across, and, in general, lollygagged around for days just enjoying myself. Play time came out to around 80 or 90 hours by the time I cleared Praetorium.

And it still felt like it went by in the blink of an eye. So when people say they "slogged" through ARR I just question how out of touch I must be with those players to have genuinely enjoyed myself so thoroughly for like 4-5x the length of time it probably took them to do it. Or maybe just enjoying the content on offer rather than forcing yourself to binge the MSQ is the key to having fun with it after all. Who knows? I definitely agree that people downplay how much the MMO aspect helps that long stretch of story *work*. The world wouldn't be as interesting without it. Your achievements wouldn't mean as much. A solo version of FFXIV wouldn't really be the same.
                    Well, for me 80 to 90 hours of playtime means about six months in real life, so the idea of levelling crafters (or BOT/MIN) without being able to fly or having a huge bank (i.e. spending a lot of time walking everywhere) is not that appealing to me. Different strokes for different folks, but I’m happy that I rushed the MSQ (some friends of mine just decided to buy the ARR quest skip instead) this time instead of bailing halfaway through because the downtime to meaningful content ratio was too high.

Persona 5 was for me a game that while long (first playthrough took me 120 hours spread throughout a year), stroke a good balance of having content interspersed with good fluff. So far post-ARR seems to be working out well enough for me, but I’m afraid it might be a couple of years until I actually get to Endwalker.
            I picked the Titan thing because it's a particularly egregious example and I'm trying to go lighter on spoilers for newer content. But there are absolutely places in Shadowbringers and Endwalker where massive forward momentum for important characters and the plot in general screech to a wailing halt so that we can meet brand new people who don't matter and spent waaaaay too long, say, building robots in the desert with them instead of actually completing someone's story arc. 

Again, I'm not saying 14 is bad and I'm not saying it doesn't hit hard when things are firing on all cylinders. But to make the point that it doesn't feel like an MMO with a ton of filler quests in hubs to pad out the runtime is absurd.
                They fixed this part in recent updates though I thought.
                    The specific thing I'm talking about in this post happens in Shadowbringers, so I doubt it. I know there was a pass at some point to cut down on some of the fluff in the really old content but I suspect they didn't get rid of all of it.
                        As someone who very recently finished ARR, it's still so slow and bloated (especially the patch quests) that it's almost hard to believe it used to be worse.
                Yeah almost every major event is precluded by a lot of meaningless quests where you gather something or have to travel someplace to talk to someone else only to then fo back to the first place
        I haven't forgot it at all, trust me we FF14 fans remember it all too well lol (hell, the part in Return from Ivalice that's an ill-considered parody of the Titan questline was recently cut from the game because everyone hated that bit too).

But in a game that has spanned 9 years with 300+ hours of main story content and 100s of hours of side story content, the fact you're reaching for one of the earliest questlines in what is universally agreed to be the weakest part of the game that doesn't hold a candle to ShB and EW actually proves my point as much as anything.

And yeah I'm not claiming every single quest in that 300+ hours is a masterpiece, the pacing can be fairly slow at times and occasionally you can get quests that border on padding (level 88 Sharlayan...) but these moments pale in comparison to MSQ meaningfully pushing the story forward in some way or another.
            I like how you say "we FF14 fans" like I'm not one of you. I didn't beat Endwalker because I hate the game or the story. But people come out of the woodwork to chop your head off if you imply anything is wrong with the plot.

You could cut *a lot* out of it and it'd be exactly the same or better. I knew I'd get a ton of people trying to *got you* me by pointing out my example is old, but it absolutely still happens. I just don't want to fill my post with Shadowbringers spoilers because unlike ARR it's actually genuinely great sometimes and I don't want to ruin that for anyone.
        It's not even good pacing for an MMO. FF14 just has an amazing story that you have to do completely mundane stuff to progress. It could almost be billed as a whole new type of interactive storytelling experience. That's not to say the mmo aspects of the game aren't good, but they're only present in the questing portion of the game when it forces you to group up which honestly just annoys me at that point because I'm vibing on the story even though group play is why I started.
            This has been updated. They recently cut out many meaningless quests to make this part of the game more enjoyable.
                I played through post-patch ARR recently, and while I wouldn't call many of the quests *meaningless* exactly, it's still wayyyyyy longer and slower than it needs to be, especially post-ARR/pre-Heavensward.
                Yeah they cut some stuff but only so much that it went from absolutely absurd to slightly ridiculous.
        Which is from ARR, the worst part of FF14 and also not what he was referring to. He explicitly calls out 3 of the 4 expansions as being better stories. 

ARR needs to get a full revamp, it very much does not sell what kind of game the rest of the game is, which is a shame because it's most people's first taste.
    FFXIV is exactly like that. I played through arr and some of the bridge content before the first expansion. There were plenty of times I was doing grindy, repetitive stuff to level up so I could do the next main quest mission. It had more of a cohesive story than other mmo's, but it was very much still an MMO. And who can forget dungeon: the movie? I was grinding that for some cosmetic event with a friend and I swear we spent more time watching a movie than actually controlling our characters. 

And let's be honest, the story in arr wasn't really anything great. It was pretty standard stuff and predictable as hell. Compare that to other ff's and it just pales in complexity, character development, and originality. Maybe the expansions improved, but the core game was only a 7\10 at best for an RPG story. 

I could go on about what I think is the right and wrong way to do MMO stories, out what makes a good singlet player story vs MMO, but I won't.
        Are you of the impression that this is controversial? ARR is a solid "Ok.". It really is nothing more. 

Get through Shadowbringers and Endwalker, and I have now played the best story, characters both friends and villains, soundtrack and writing in all of FF. Possibly my favorite in all gaming.
        ARR is barely even the prologue of the game. FF14 dramatically changes in quality from Heavensward on. It's not considered the best mmorpg for nothing.
        Literally nobody talking about how good FF14 is refers to ARR. The guy literally said Heavensward, Endwalker and Shadowbringers.
        You played the worst bits of the game and didn't touch any of the actual stuff that FFXIV won a shit ton of awards for. Everyone agrees that there are a lot of low points in the game, but the highs are well up there, enough to make FFXIV in the top 3 of FF, even the best for many people.
            The worst bits of the game comprise the entire first 50-ish hours of mandatory content. I like FFXIV but I really can't blame anyone for dropping out during or right after ARR because it's boring, long, and mandatory. It's an extremely valid criticism of the game.
        I don't think many FFXIV will disagree with you that ARR's story was okay at best. However Heavensward, Shadowbringers and Endwalker are definiately what people will think of when they talk about FFXIV's amazing story. I'll say that FFXIV has hit a groove in 'how' they tell the story, but this 'how' isn't really for everyone.
        ARR is not what people talk about when they describe FFXIV as a really good story. And the game is nine years old and has very much learned from it's early iteration.
I didn’t get that vibe from XV at all, it felt like a regular open world game - I think XV fucked up by releasing too early and splitting the story across 1000 mediums. I played Royal and loved it - but from what I’ve read the story is even MORE jumbled in the original and it was really disjointed feeling.
    I just plain stopped in the original.  Didn't remember a single thing that happened one day, had no attachment to a single character.  I just had no idea why I was playing.  I replayed the Royal and it definitely clicked more... that being said, I'm still not much of a fan.  The combat was super lacking, and the story needed a ton of editing.  And the game movement just took forever.  I got tired every time I hit a new zone.
XV didn’t really fail as a whole. It sold really well and the general consensus is everything before the linear last 25% of the game was great. I remember me and a friend feeling like it was one of the best FFs we ever played…and then the linear ending happened.
    XV didn't fail but it probably did lasting damage to the brand being the second mediocre Final Fantasy after XIII (with XIV 1.0 wreaking havoc in the background where the single player fans couldn't see). It still had the "Versus XIII was the real game" hype behind it at release which was hype that started in a time when there was more reverence for the Final Fantasy franchise. XVI is the first one that has to deal with the consequences of XIII and XV's mixed reception.
        For the hard-core fans probably, but people don't like to admit that FF is a very broad appeal franchise, with the majority being casual fans.  It's the most mainstream JRPG by a wide margin.  Each mainline game just needs cutting edge graphics, and it'll sell like hotcakes
    The linear ending was annoying gameplay wise, especially not knowing you’d be stuck there till it’s over, but story-wise it really kicked the shit out of me lol

Though it’s nice they let you go back for endgame
I was pretty hyped for the game after seeing the movie. You roll out into the open world in the car, go up to a gas station, and get a quest to go find beans.

Talk about disappointing.
    Seems pretty standard for the start of any RPG, can't be taking down bosses the size of gods asscrack right out of the gate, you gotta be collecting 10 bear asses and giving some herbs you found on the floor to old lady dithers to treat her back pain.
Well good thing not even FFXIV is designed like that. And Yoshi-P has commented multiple times that FFXVI is like a fast paced roller coaster so that seems to go against what you are describing.
I wouldn't worry about it. FFXIV team have mastered the craft of making an MMO feel like a jrpg rather than an MMO (complete with a full npc party system and basically a traditional JRPG structure to its story) so I'm sure they are fully aware that this game shouldn't just be FFXIV offline. With each new expansion the game felt less and less like an MMO with jrpg elements and more and more like a JRPG with mmo elements (in a good way) so I don't think they'll fall into that trap. 

FFXV also had huge development issues, the game was essentially developed in 2 years so they had to resort to MMO style quests to fill gaps. Same kind of situation as Dragon Age Inquisition's content.
There are dozens of us! DOZENS!
>I'm keeping a close eye on Forspoken too because it's the same team

Tabata made XV what it was. Forspoken is helmed by some western Hollywood-type writers, so I wouldn't expect the same.
Man, I didn’t even know there was FF15 hate. That’s definitely my favorite FF game, personally. I loved the combat, characters, and settings so much. The story was whatever, but most FF games in the last 20 years have been that way. Doesn’t detract from how much fun that game was for me, though.
    i knew there was a decent amount of hate, but i think its mostly just cause its so different of a game from the classic FFs. doesnt appeal to the same type of person i guess
        The release hate was justified. The most complete edition (Royal edition I think?) adds so much content and extra context that I would say the game deserved a re-review. The base game was missing so much.
        >doesnt appeal to the same type of person i guess

Nah its more it just wasn't fleshed out enough, there brilliance under the surface but the game just skips past it.

For example a big moment should have been Ignis going blind, yet the how is completely skipped over devaluing the drama that comes from it.

XV is decent, better than some others in the series, but the development hell it went through absolutely marred the final product in a big way.
        In my experience the hate isn't due to any inherent negative with the gameplay, characters, or story. It's that they put the story out in a movie, anime, and other random places rather than in-game. Then rushed through the in-game story. Then to top it all off, canceled half the DLC which would have completed the story.
It is, and there's an option to play a shorter versio - it's moreso you switching every now and then from playing as Noct to playing as The Bros.
Honestly even if the story is dumb like most people say, I think it looks fun. Just waiting for the steam release in another year or whatever.
    It's dumb in kind of a smart way (well, at least they try to make it so).   

There is a reason character interactions in the beginning are so weird and outlandish.
tbh i don't think i'm even joking, mate. i tried the critically acclaimed ff14 and found it to be more a visual novel than a video game as the quests were atrocious and the early dungeons were in exercise in pressing 2-3 buttons on repeat. and all the good content seems to be an expansion or two in but i'm also told the story is a big part of the game and how i shouldn't skip it and i do not have the patience for any of it. 

but stranger of paradise? that is a video game, with gameplay, and it's fun in it's opening hours. a winner in my book.
I don't know if it's SIDE or CBU3's English localisation director doing the casting and directing, but they've managed to strike absolute gold with most of the voices, which is amazing since a lot of the best performances are from actors without many credits to their name. Rene Zagger as Emet-Selch and Matt Stokoe as Elidibus give unparalleled performances.
Well they’ve said they are launching 2 unannounced live service games before the end of the fiscal year which is in March/April I believe. So they’re going to have to show them eventually along with their next slate of games. I believe God of War is the last game from their initial showcase for when they announced the ps5. They’ve seen to do announcements in waves and wait until all those games are out or almost out to announce the next phase.
The art director for XVI, Hiroshi Minagawa, essentially created the look of Ivalice alongside Yasumi Matsuno. Minagawa was art director on FF Tactics and Vagrant Story, Co-director on FFXII.  There's a ton of Ivalice staff at CBU3 working on FFXVI, but he's arguably the biggest
Yeah I probably should have led with this as well lol
This is the most apt description of me lmao. It’s insane how strongly this franchise is still kicking all these years later.
I preordered Final Fantasy Explorers back in the day, AMA
    Same. I even own the Collectors Edition of World of Final Fantasy.
Not to mention a Soken whore. I really want to see what the mad genius (and he is) can do with this canvas.
It makes with the mouth animations lining up so well, and it just sounds like it was written in English rather than translated
The first trailer, during a [State of Play 2 years ago](https://youtu.be/tjji8NEW9lo?t=296), said that it will also be available on PC, but the [standalone trailer](https://youtu.be/CUY9beBLIKM?t=221) just says PS5. The last trailer and this one don't mention platforms at all. A simultaneous PC release is not guaranteed, but it's not completely out of the cards either.
    As I understand it, this was a error and they've stated FFXVI will not be releasing on PC, at least not on day 1.
Probably going to be 1 year PS5 exclusive then 1 year Epic Games Store exclusive.
Yeah. PC market in Japan is non-existent. Heck, even Playstation and Xbox are on the mud. Only console fourishing there is the switch because of its portability. And mobiles.
A lot of conversation about it happens over at r/JRPG and r/FinalFantasy.
Then in the end you find out all the events were manipulated by Badasss Badguy Sadchildhood, who summoned the God of Whatever, so the politics didn't even really matter.
I don't think we know confirmed details for the developers/designers for a lot of this game yet but Akihiko Yoshida (FF12 character designer) was the main character designer of the 3rd FFXIV expansion and along with Matsuno has been collaborating with YoshiP a lot recently.

He very well could be the character designer of FF16. There are of course rumors Matsuno is involved in the game too.
> And the OP is right that these character design are taking cues from XII.

And what's the problem with that? Are you saying the character designs in 12 are generic? Lol

Not enough Bishonen kpop guys I guess.
Not true, look at FFXIV, the 3 main starting cities are all led by women, the group you are part of was led by a women too and in the group there were an equal-ish split of women and men. It changes over time but the pint still stands. 

As for FFXVI, because of the medieval setting it probably makes a lot more sense to have a male dominated cast but we've yet to play the game so we'll see.
[deleted]
That actually seems to be changing, slightly - Triangle Strategy and FF7: Crisis Core are both releasing to Steam day-and-date with the Epic version.
> fidelity

Well now we're talking about 2 different things. I'm talking about art direction, story, and characters. I'm sure in terms of "quality" it's miles ahead of anything else. It's SE's flagship JRPG after all.
    Sure, but are those other JRPG at least 3D? Fidelity is part of art direction, Triangle Strategy and GoT might be similar thematically, but still feel very different to me.

I was just wondering if there are games that look close to XVI, because it appeals to me a lot.
Even the first Final Fantasy has robots and a space station.

Final Fantasy 4 is as much sci-fi as it is medieval European fantasy and it's awesome for it (it also throws ninjas and martial arts in the mix because it's [the rule of cool](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool)).
X-3 please
Absolutely, can't wait for KH4! Obviously still excited for this game but it just isn't grabbing me right now.
FFXV was definitely not the right vibe I was thinking of, I’m mostly remembering altissia being very cathedral-y apparently
Definitely Triangle Strategy vibes from the "look at our many warring cultures: the normal one, the snooty one, the Arabic one..." bit.
I would argue it actually goes back to 12, not 13. It's the idea that you pick one character and AI controls the rest. I'm not counting 11, because that's an MMO, but in 1-10 you control your whole party. From 12 to (seemingly) 16, you pick one character to control, and the AI does the rest. That "frees" them to make the combat more interactive. I put "frees" in quotations, because in practice it seems to actually just result in every character playing like a fighter, because the mages are best left to AI, since they require the least input, and the AI will control melee very suboptimally.
    Oh I'd totally agree it just felt like 12 was sort of a weird experiment that although it's easy to see how it inspired what came after it, was still different enough that I felt like I shouldn't say 12 and beyond, but honestly you're right.
    I found the opposite. If you left the AI in control of the makes then they would chew through your MP far faster than it would replenish. 7R didn't even bother having the AI use MP.
[deleted]
    Yep agreed, and those were also some of my favorites (including Persona for me). I mean I don't begrudge them for changing the style and I'm not out here shaking my fist saying they need to go back; if it's making them more money etc. that's just the way things evolve sometimes and I get that, it's just personally I'm not a fan.
Vaan's the guy you walk around as outside of combat, so I'd definitely call him the protag, as much as there is a single one.  And I certainly wouldn't call Squall or Zidane "dudely."
    Yeah if the question is just whether or not the characters are dudely then zidane and squall definitely don't qualify as dudely. Squalls got enough edgy bad boy vibes so he doesn't seem androgynous to me and Zidane is like a weird monkey boy who I wouldn't call manly but he's very boyish.
    >Vaan's the guy you walk around as outside of combat

He's the errand boy
    He was added post Matsuno basically as the character the player could identify with instead of a dude in his mid 30s - I can't remember if Basch or Balthier was meant to be the player character early on. Everything rotates around Ashe though.
        Basch was the original main
Vaan kind of has an excuse too, the execs wanted a young relatable main lead so they shoehorned him in, which is why he kind of just feels like he's tagging along on the journey and basically stops being the main character 5 hours in.
If you told me this description was for Fire Emblem, I wouldn't question it.
    Doesn't get that much breast and cleavage in Fire Emblem Three Houses
        Nah, but Heroes more than makes up for it
Aiit I'm preordering this game now. 😭 These ratings just sold me.
    I'm pretty sure that's for Final Fantasy Type-0, not FFXVI
They're talking about Type-0 I'm pretty sure
    Yep!
also had the first FF Limp Bizkit-bomb
That was an awesome scene, too.

People can say what they want about that game.  It knows what it's about.
    It was about stopping chaos?
Endwalker has two scenes in a particular zone that I still can't believe are in a T rated game.
    Yeah, >!dunno how they got away with some dude putting a gun in his mouth and pulling the trigger with a T rating tbh.!<
        Yoshi-P's team has mastered the art of "implying but not showing" in FFXIV. You never actually seen the guy put the gun in his mouth, but the audience could put two and a two together within the context.
        A guy shot himself on-screen in Insomniac's Spider-Man and that got a T.
They said they wanted *that* scene in Shadowbringers to not happen while obscured but couldn't because of the T rating
    Which scene was this?
        Poor Tesleen.
They're using Luminous for Forspoken. Looks basically exactly like 15
Came to say this! I signed up summer of 2020 so I could mentally survive the pandemic and its been one of my best gaming choices ever. No pressure.
    Me and my friends joined just before the pandemic kicked off and its been a wild ride. I already enjoyed the game but once I reached shadowbringers it became an all-time classic rivalling the rose-tinted glasses of the other games. Endwalker launch was a special time for me too, theres a great feeling of community running along the main quests with all the other players, and its great just being able to pop on a few times a year to catch up on content rather than feeling obligated to be on every single day.
        Endwalker was my first time being truly caught up to MSQ. There's a certain *je ne sais quo* about going through an area and seeing two dozen people in the same innocuous spot, all watching a cutscene.

I sped through the entire expansion in a week, and to this day I still think >!Ultima Thule is one of the most beautifully haunting area in the game, if not in games period.!<
            That last walk was one of the heaviest things I’ve seen from a game.
[deleted]
    there is a free trial you can play the base game and first expansion up to level 60. I hear it's critically acclaimed....
        Specifically speaking the trial takes you through one of the best story arcs in the game with the Heavansward expansion, it will give you a really good idea if the game is something you want to continue
    It does

The game has multiple expansions

A Realm Reborn > Heavensward > Stormblood > Shadowbringers > Endwalker.

You get to play ARR and HW for free, which should last you about 200 hours. ARR is a bit slow, but HW has a great story.
        Another note is that if you buy Endwalker you get all the previous expansions with it. Only ever need to buy the latest expac, and you get all of them.
            But if you buy the game keep in mind that you can't access the trial anymore. So you should play until lvl 60 and finish heavensword and then buy the game
It'll just take half a year of casual play to catch up.
    Nothing to really "catch up" with if your main draw is the campagin. Just go at it at your own pace and enjoy one of the best rides in video games.
        Yeah been playing it at a pretty slow pace for over a year and am at Endwalker, been an incredible experience and I'm really glad I haven't rushed myself.
        Sure but when you have friends talk you into it like most of the time when you get into an MMO and everyone's excited about this new expansion coming or that new patch and then it's like cool but in a year and a half you can be there.
    The thing is, unlike WoW, the "real game" game isn't at the end. The game is the journey as well as the destination. It's amazing.


You can even join a guild (Free Company) and they can *join you* in the biggest moments, their levels getting synced down without making the content completely trivial for people who haven't seen it a million times. It's just a really fun game that goes on and on and on. ...Once you get through most of ARR. Ooph.
        I agree the story experience is breathtaking, but even then the actual gameplay during questing is somehow even less engaging than leveling usually is, and I could not stand how on one hand the game was constantly making me disband my party to do certain quests but then on the other hand would make me join other big parties to do others, and some of those big group quests would be brain dead dungeons or they'd be challenging raids that you actually needed to study up on to get past. It's like I had to both care and not care more than I wanted to the whole time.

But again when you really were into the story it's like you could've dropped all the gameplay and just traveled from story beat to story beat. Whatever quests had you actually do felt like afterthoughts.
            Oh 100%. One of the things I miss from WoW is how clever and variable the quests got over time. Still simple stuff, but different.


14 has some neat stuff but it comes later on in the form of solo duties, and those and few and far between. Many agree basically solo boss fights. There was one brilliant and memorable one in Endwalker, though.
            I think the core problem is the first 2 expansions, despite their attempts to fix them (it’s been over a year for me, maybe 2?) are a real slog story wise IMO.

So unless you can skip through it but still get the story to lead into the other stuff it’s a big ask for a casual player. But they’re doing something right so my archmchair analysis is worth less than a grain of salt.
    > It'll just take half a year of casual play to catch up.

Way more. The main campaign that gets you to max level alone is what, 600 hours long?

I no lifed it last year, from ARR to the end of Endwalker, and it took me 2 months to finish it.

But the MSQ is the game's strongest point by far so that's fine. It's a fantastic story.
        It really is.
when is that npc update out you think?
> You can basically just play through it as a singleplayer game by design.

That's because it is a single player game at its core. 

After reaching EndWalker, I can say this game feels like a 300 hours cinematic where you occasionally kill mobs and rarely group with other players.
> There's no daily logins

Are you sure you played the game? There's both daily and weekly grinds, golden saucer, and a bunch of other random stuff with daily/weekly caps.
    Oh, there’s always something you can spend your time on, but none of it is mandatory. You can always get caught up in short order if you step away for a time.
        Same is true for WoW as well. Return at the start of a new patch and you have a bunch of catchup mechanics.
The problem with FF14 with me is that the game require a monthly sub, and I would feel guilty if I only play 2-4 hours a week. Hence I swore it off instead of trying to play for the sake of playing.

That is why I like GW2 better...I can quit for six years and still be ready to go through end game content cause GW2 gears don't become obsolete.
    I usually just put FF14 off for a few months and come back when there’s a few major patches of content to get through. I don’t really see it as an MMO you keep coming back to every day. At least unless you really love the world and get sucked into every side activity. 

Even the endgame’s progression is very short once you’re there, so it doesn’t feel like you need to stay subscribed for months.
    Sure--that makes total sense to me.

I've also been a Final Fantasy fan since the original in the 80s, though, so 14 was an easy and nostalgic sell for me when I transitioned.
It's spoilers for him because he already said there will be characters who will be with the MC when he goes to different places. So what does that mean? If he shows a trailer with the protagonist with other people that makes it already a spoiler because people will have an idea what will happen on when and where.

That's enough of a spoiler for him.

Also I think you should know that the game was supposed to release this year but SE moved it back just for Forspoken.
Could it also be that their irises don't move completely like humans? If you look at [Cindy](https://youtu.be/8PMDFu9d83Y?t=446) in FFV15,  she has the big eye movements to change what she's looking at but not the little flicks (saccades) that actual people do. Compare for example [Kingsglaive](https://youtu.be/UblcNFVVHT8?t=51), and the fact that the pre-rendered cutscenes in FFXV do have them.

Their movements are also a little stiff outside of fighting, anytime they walk, run or gesture it's somewhat exaggerated. Although that might be intentional so it adds to the feeling of dynamism. 

Also the fact that their faces don't deform that much when they move. Compare [Ellie's facial expressions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-iZiuT0zPU) in The Last of Us Part II even in the still-posed Model Viewer, she has cheek creases and brow creases and her hair moves realistically.  

Actually compare Noctis and >!Sid!< from FFXV [in the same scene alone](https://youtu.be/8PMDFu9d83Y?t=467). >!Sid!<'s irises still don't move, but >!his!< whole face is full of wrinkles and creases that are moving and giving a lot of detail. In comparison, Noctis only moves his eyes, cheeks and lips a little, and no wrinkles in sight. Even more true for their hands, arms, tight-fitting clothing, etc..

(No shade by the way, just observations.)
I'm glad they doubled down on him and Y'stola.  They're two if the better written characters in FF history.  They both start out generic, but you really get to know them as time goes on.  And tbh, they don't really change that much, you just understand why they're the way they are, which is amazing writing.  Less Flanderization, more depth.
    It's hard to single out most of the main party but I'd probably throw Thancred in there too. Starts off as the "cool playboy" type and really gets some fantastic depth by the end of Shadowbringers.
        Special mention to Alphinaud throughout Heavensward. He was ablittle shit in A Realm Reborn, but he grew into a far more likeable person by the end. His growth as he became more humble was well done.
            Hell Alisaie too. She went from being stuffed into a highly optional raid series to being her own character who stands apart from her brother.
                Oh yes, getting to spend more time with her was one of the best parts of Stormblood.

But Alisale wasnt ablittle shit like her twin lol
                    It was honestly the highlight for me. I love both the twins now, they really balance each other out. It was great finally getting to know her. They're really playing the long-form format well, having minor characters reappear from years ago to become lead roles, >!and also having leading characters retire to side ones as they do their own things!< really makes the world feel alive and natural. Its the same reason One Piece feels like such a grand adventure.
        From Playboy Thancred to Depressed Dadcred
        The stuff with him and Ryne is so so fucking good. Maybe my absolute favorite moment in ShB is the scene with him in the graveyard though.
Absolutely in my top 3 as well. Pretty well every scene he's in during later expansions is impeccably written and acted.
[deleted]
    Dragon Quest does this, it actually tends to work pretty well.
    I know Xenoblade 2 used accents to highlight where a character came from. The Blades typically had an American accent (from metropolitan to valley girl to high school venacular), people from the more agriculturally focused Gormott had Welsh accents, or the people from Mor Ardain had Scottish accents. This feature sort of carried on in Xenoblade 3 (since it follows XC1 and 2).
    Final Fantasy IX had a great localisation IMO which used different accents etc (although obviously it's not voiced).
Also back in 1.0 he has a pretty wild storyline that the olde English played into. Urianger recognized the obscure prophecy van Darnus was using as a road map for Project Meteor... so he traveled around reciting those exact prophecies to distract van Darnus so he(?)° didn't notice the Circle of Knowing working on stopping Project Meteor. It worked great, and it's a pity there are no callbacks to this in Garlean related content later on.

°English localization screwed up here, long story short in Japanese Nael was female from the start but her gender was never explicitly mentioned; you can do that in Japanese without it being suspicious like avoiding all gender references would be in English. Localizers assumed the enemy commander was male. That's why the dialogue in Coils is so bizarre; the localizers skip the *obvious* Samus reveal explanation for "him" being a woman and go for Bahamut changing Nael's gender for... reasons. This was later retconned further to a female relative stepping into the original Nael's armor after his death.
16 is done by the same team as 14, and 14's localization is an interesting one. That one is done in Japanese first, but the English localization is so well-done that even a good chunk of Japanese players prefer it to the original Japanese. 14's JP script isn't bad, but it's kind of generic fantasy in some places; it's really more of a testament to just how beloved the EN localization is.

So now with 16, I believe it was reported that they did all the English voice work *first* and then translated it back into Japanese, with 14's much-beloved head of localization Michael-Christopher "Koji" Fox being the Localization Director for 16 as well.
Soken usually does a goofy performance during Fan Fests.

In 2016 he [played](https://youtu.be/KwKUnJ2yO7s) a dungeon theme using two instruments and then just kicking a cardboard box.
FFXIV's third expansion, Shadowbringers, has a day time track called "Civilizations" for one of its six zones. Pretty much from day one when the expansion released the "LA HEE" got memed hard and still does to this day. The FFXIV team does fanfests every two years (usually used as a staging grounds to tease and announce the next expansion) where they do loads of stuff for and with the playerbase.

The clip you're confused about is from the fanfest 2021, which would have normally been three separate ones spread over the late fall 2020 to early spring 2021 in Japan, the US and Europe but due to the pandemic they streamed it. One of the sections was about several of the ingame tracks of the game, either played on piano, by the game's own band (THE PRIMALS) or by the man, Masayoshi Soken, himself like the video linked above. Basically a giant love letter to the community, showing that pretty much every part of the development team is in tune with the community.

At another part of the fanfest, the team did another homage to a meme where [members of the dev team danced to the live version of the "A Long Fall" track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6tEi-6BLsw) that plays [during one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NApxz5bSl20) of the [Shadowbringers dungeons.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9QD25nakt8) The different colors of the shirts stand for tank (blue), healer (green) and DPS (red) - representing a dungeon group.
This is from the fan festival in 2021, where the devs put on a convention to celebrate the game. There's often a bunch of announcements, events, and as you see here, a concert. 2021 was fully remote due to COVID.

The singer, Soken, is the main composer of FFXIV and is very highly regarded. This was one of the songs in the concert, which was a cover of a [overworld theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ascfjJXDWjo). One of the lyrics in the theme is La Hee, which has become a meme in the FF community. 

So basically, this legend walks on stage with no preamble, goes "Do you know La Hee?" and starts to sing... that. It was hilarious.
To add on to the rest of the context: 

Soken's always had a silly side where he's not afraid to go on stage and act the fool to put on some truly memorable performances, but this particular FanFest (where the above took place) he announced that he'd spent much of the pandemic secretly working from the hospital where he was being treated for cancer. He only told as many people as he had to in order to make the working arrangement possible and asked that they keep it secret from the rest of the development team, so that he could work as "normally" as possible. 

He went on to say that his cancer is completely in remission and that the thought of the fans enjoying his work got him through the experience. So in addition to his general silliness, I think there's a hefty dose of "I'm still alive to be able to do this!" thrown in there as well.
It's Civilizations from the [Rak'Tika Greatwood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ascfjJXDWjo) zone in FFXIV, Soken wanted to perform it himself as he originally intended it.
I was fortunate enough to play FFXIV for many hours with a good friend.

Later, during a particularly difficult part of my life I rediscovered Sultana Dreaming, I absolutely broke down sobbing, it felt like home. Like being safe around good friends with peace in your heart.

Whenever I listen to it to this day I still am comforted in a way that is difficult to describe.
or when he remixes an old song and does.. [amazing things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsX6nxwCZ1o)
I was just listing off the top of my head!
(Some minor spoilers for Endwalker below via song titles)

For those unaware, Ishikawa and Imamura were responsible for (or heavily involved in) creating such songs as: The Black Wolf Stalks Again, Your Answer, the Sharlayan daytime theme, the Ktisis Hyperborea theme, and the Endwalker dungeon boss theme, and several of the dynamis themes.

Soken probably still deserves the lion's share of credit for building FFXIV's musical identity, but his team are fantastic composers and arrangers in their own right.
    The remixes in Endwalker of other expansion songs were great at repurposing the vibes of the original songs with adding new character to them.  Really well done by those composers and the team.
The Last Remnant was a middling game that was severely weighed down by its confusing explanation (or lack thereof) regarding the combat and party systems that was perhaps a little *too* RNG and automated, because in the end you're only influencing the battle.

However, it's really unfortunate that people almost never give the world, races, art and music of The Last Remnant the time of day because of how under the radar it is. It's full of concepts that are so cool and a lot of them are executed very well... it's just actually playing the game where half of the time I'm scratching my head or beating it against a brick wall. I agree with you, and I am excited for FFXVI, but still..

Further pissed off that the Remastered version of the game looks graphically far superior and is a great remaster, but is locked to console at max 1080p (because it came out before PS4 Pro) with no patch, and they REMOVED the prexisting PC version from all digital storefronts with no announcement or hint whatsoever that we'll get a port of the remaster.
    I’ve had this game in my steam library for ages. Is this some kind underperforming inferior version? I know nothing about it other than buying it ages ago.
        The PC version is perfectly fine, it runs very well and works right out of the box with controllers too (you may have to switch to controller control setting and max the graphics first). Funnily enough, it was considered probably the only good JRPG port on PC for years upon years despite the game itself not being hot.

The remastered version on console moves it to Unreal Engine 4 and honestly it's very impressive how much of UE4 they shoved into it without it looking like a rush job. And it also adds a super-sprint mode that lets you run in the overworld sections MUCH faster... that's it.
    The PC port doesn't really run at 4k either so you're not missing anything. I have both, the console versions have better lighting while the pc version has better framerates.
Game was terrible, but had a cool world and ideas that were executed poorly.
They probably have to, in order to restore faith in the series after how FFXV was (understandably) received.
    I liked FFXV!

Bad Final Fantasy game but great camping with your buddies simulator.
        Ffxv is a interesting “failure”. For like every part it does well there’s 3 parts that are poorly developed.

But I think it’s the best FF game to establish the party as a real group. As opposed to a band of characters joining together for a common goal. Like they really were friends and it was obvious.

The campfire scene in the end of the game I think is a payoff worthy of getting through some of the slog that is the game.

Great world, lore, just poorly connected and told. I would love for them to redo it one day the way properly.
        I really like it too but they pretty blatantly gave up on the game/world halfway through their DLC plans. I think we ultimately got 4/7 character DLCs and one ok MP DLC. There's quite a bit of that story they deliberately left out.
        FFXV flirting with magical realism for its world is infinitely more interesting to me than the drab fantasy world for FFXVI.  I don't fault anyone for liking it though and wanting a return to that type of setting given it's integral to the series' history.
    > after how FFXV was (understandably) received.

And FF13, and FF13-2, and FF13-3, and to some extent FF12.   
They really need to restore people faith in mainline non MMO Final Fantasy games.
And keeping Nomura well the fuck away.

That gives me hope.
    Some of you act like Nomura killed your families.
        In another timeline he might have!!
            He kills your family in a random card battler side game off the main series
                that ends up being pivotal to the plot for the next decade
            I bet it was actually his nobody Romnuxa traveling between worldlines with the power of waking. Easy mistake to make
            Underrated comment. Next thing you know, Donald and Goofy will show up!
        My family died in the pouch and zipper wars so he did.
        Nomura didn't kill my family, he just won't leave my damn house.
    >Game has nothing to do with Nomura, he's not even remotely involved

reddit: GRRR NOMURA
        Nomura is writing the last 2 books of ASOIF? The delayed release makes so much sense now...
    Nomura has had some kind of creative input in nearly every single good thing that Square Enix has ever created.

Why the hate?
        Nomura to me is like Zack Snyder, dude is really good at what made his name (Nomura a character designer, Snyder was a director of photography) but when they started to get director roles, that's when it got meh.

I think that the first 2 KH games are good, but that's it. Everything else that he was involved as a director is sub par, but when he gets to just design things, he does a good job.
            kingdom hearts is really the only series he's directed, sans the f7 remake, but he wasn't responsible for the unpopular changes to its narrative despite people thinking it. even seems like most don't realize how much he contributed to the original

his work as producer/concept creator also extends to twewy and stranger of paradise, both of which are good!
                TWEWY’s design is top notch
            I don’t even think he’s a bad director per se, but he reminds me a bit of George Lucas where he needs someone to keep his ideas in check. I love KH1 and 2, along with the VII remake, and he’s not the primary writer on any of those. He’s got a good eye for visual flair, generally fun gameplay decisions and can come up with some interesting plot points, but he needs a good writer and producer to reign him in or it just goes off the rails and becomes too much.
Oh I absolutely love how they handled combat and materia progression in that. Like Character swapping alone in general. After YEARS of struggling from Square Enix to get a mix of traditional FF and action combat right. All I could think was how some other action-JRPGS would have totally benefited from that concept alone (*freaking Xenoblade Chronicles!!!).*

But to it's degree, it's a Remake of something that came before and not something new and unique at the time. FFXIII, and especially FFXV could have been treated a hell of a lot better. So unfortunately it had to be a Remake to get people back on Square's Side...or it was fantastic story/world building of a MMO that got people like me to glance at single Player Final Fantasy once again. Hence why I'llstill state that Yoshi P and Creative Business Unit III seem to be last bastion of people that want Final Fantasy to be new and unique once again. But we'll see when FFXVI lands.
I'm hoping they're learning from their mistakes. FF7R really was an enjoyable game that I could not put down. I usually don't finish most games I buy tbh.. So to me its a really good game. definitely can name flaws, but the pros definitely outweighed the cons.
    It feels to me that Square has tons of talented people out in their company, but has difficulty reigning them in and making them focus. I think sometimes it is a clash of creative egos (which happens a lot in creative spaces, music, film, animation, etc.), sometimes it is mismanagement by the guys in charge, lack of understanding of certain technologies (i.e. FFXIII), or sometimes it is having too grand of a focus that is difficult to translate to a game (i.e. KH3, FFXV/VSXIII). FFXIV was successful partially because Yoshi P and his team found that the 1.0 team, though talented lacked focus and that sometimes caused chaos.
Square Enix has a ton of amazing talent they just have difficulty focusing it. Yoshi P's biggest achievement was focusing the talent of the FFXIV team so hopefully he can work his magic from the start here.
Nowhere was it more apparent that it was a rush job than that town you go to for Leviathan. That town was *way* too developed for it to be a one-off quest area, it was clearly intended to be another town you could regularly visit, maybe even a second hub, but all of that was casted aside. 

Imagine what XV could have been like if it was led by the XVI team. The same graphics, the same exploration, the same combat system (which, honestly, is deeper than most people give credit for), but done in a way that doesn't just feel like a road trip with the bros. 

[I still think back to when XV was originally called XIII Versus.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6At_bb1PNU)
    Agree completely. The game was terrific until then. Terrible after
Rush job? That bitch got started and restarted like a dozen times and took forever to actually come out. Don't forget XV started as part of a threesome of games that was supposed to be XIII
    Yes, and the last build was a rush job. That's what I meant by that.
XII was ahead of its time in many ways.  The few tweaks with Zodiac Age keeps the game feeling extremely modern.  Like if you told me Zodiac Age on switch was a new game released last year, I would believe you.
It was mixed amongst fans.  It wasn't bad per se, but it definitely wasn't everyone's cup of tea.
    Definitely mixed - it’s actually my personal favorite. Depends on who you ask
> and the story required too many extra-curriculars

To date, it's the only mainline FF that requires those extra-curriculars to comprehend the story in full. No other FF does this.
Ahh how soon we forget the several hours of quests where you have to gather supplies to throw a party for yourself before you're allowed to fight Titan.

Like, 14 has narrative high points for sure. But its pacing is pretty wack by nature of it being an MMO and it is inarguably 'like that' as you put it.
    It's a little disingenuous to use their earliest content as the benchmark for CBU3 instead of the all recent stuff that they've won piles of awards for. There are of course obvious limitations to the gameplay and storytelling as a consequence of FFXIV being built on a decade old MMO, but the real meat of FFXIV's story succeeds on it's own merits. You could rip it all out of the MMO and build a (very long) singleplayer mainline title out of it with minimal adjustments (Mostly just getting rid of the filler quests), and it would still be phenomenal.
        >You could rip it all out of the MMO and build a (very long) singleplayer mainline title out of it with minimal adjustments

People really underestimate how long the MSQ is. People regularly complain about JRPGs breaking the 40 hour mark, and that includes gameplay. FF14 is over 20 hours of cutscene time \*per expansion.\*

[https://www.reddit.com/user/Cyberfunk3/comments/y5gauf/ffxiv\_tracker\_62\_update\_improved\_formatting/](https://www.reddit.com/user/Cyberfunk3/comments/y5gauf/ffxiv_tracker_62_update_improved_formatting/)

A quick eyeballing of time says I 100%'d the Pixel Remasters of 1 through 4 (\~115 hours) in less time than it takes to watch cutscenes in FF14 (\~123 hours). That's watching the extended version of the LotR trilogy 10 times, and still leaving time for bathroom breaks! If you could play all of the MSQ cutscenes sequentially without having to do dungeons and walk places between them, you'd be able to put the controller/mouse down for \*five days.\*

This is tolerable when you're playing it as it comes out, but don't undersell how gargantuanly long the story is, or how much of an advantage the MMO format breaking up these story sections over literal years helps.
            Yeah I recently created an alt and just finished the 2.0 content. Sure the story content itself is about 20 hours, and I'm honestly okay with that, but I broke it up with a *lot* of side content. I leveled all my crafters, did every blue quest I came across, and, in general, lollygagged around for days just enjoying myself. Play time came out to around 80 or 90 hours by the time I cleared Praetorium.

And it still felt like it went by in the blink of an eye. So when people say they "slogged" through ARR I just question how out of touch I must be with those players to have genuinely enjoyed myself so thoroughly for like 4-5x the length of time it probably took them to do it. Or maybe just enjoying the content on offer rather than forcing yourself to binge the MSQ is the key to having fun with it after all. Who knows? I definitely agree that people downplay how much the MMO aspect helps that long stretch of story *work*. The world wouldn't be as interesting without it. Your achievements wouldn't mean as much. A solo version of FFXIV wouldn't really be the same.
                Well, for me 80 to 90 hours of playtime means about six months in real life, so the idea of levelling crafters (or BOT/MIN) without being able to fly or having a huge bank (i.e. spending a lot of time walking everywhere) is not that appealing to me. Different strokes for different folks, but I’m happy that I rushed the MSQ (some friends of mine just decided to buy the ARR quest skip instead) this time instead of bailing halfaway through because the downtime to meaningful content ratio was too high.

Persona 5 was for me a game that while long (first playthrough took me 120 hours spread throughout a year), stroke a good balance of having content interspersed with good fluff. So far post-ARR seems to be working out well enough for me, but I’m afraid it might be a couple of years until I actually get to Endwalker.
        I picked the Titan thing because it's a particularly egregious example and I'm trying to go lighter on spoilers for newer content. But there are absolutely places in Shadowbringers and Endwalker where massive forward momentum for important characters and the plot in general screech to a wailing halt so that we can meet brand new people who don't matter and spent waaaaay too long, say, building robots in the desert with them instead of actually completing someone's story arc. 

Again, I'm not saying 14 is bad and I'm not saying it doesn't hit hard when things are firing on all cylinders. But to make the point that it doesn't feel like an MMO with a ton of filler quests in hubs to pad out the runtime is absurd.
            They fixed this part in recent updates though I thought.
                The specific thing I'm talking about in this post happens in Shadowbringers, so I doubt it. I know there was a pass at some point to cut down on some of the fluff in the really old content but I suspect they didn't get rid of all of it.
                    As someone who very recently finished ARR, it's still so slow and bloated (especially the patch quests) that it's almost hard to believe it used to be worse.
            Yeah almost every major event is precluded by a lot of meaningless quests where you gather something or have to travel someplace to talk to someone else only to then fo back to the first place
    I haven't forgot it at all, trust me we FF14 fans remember it all too well lol (hell, the part in Return from Ivalice that's an ill-considered parody of the Titan questline was recently cut from the game because everyone hated that bit too).

But in a game that has spanned 9 years with 300+ hours of main story content and 100s of hours of side story content, the fact you're reaching for one of the earliest questlines in what is universally agreed to be the weakest part of the game that doesn't hold a candle to ShB and EW actually proves my point as much as anything.

And yeah I'm not claiming every single quest in that 300+ hours is a masterpiece, the pacing can be fairly slow at times and occasionally you can get quests that border on padding (level 88 Sharlayan...) but these moments pale in comparison to MSQ meaningfully pushing the story forward in some way or another.
        I like how you say "we FF14 fans" like I'm not one of you. I didn't beat Endwalker because I hate the game or the story. But people come out of the woodwork to chop your head off if you imply anything is wrong with the plot.

You could cut *a lot* out of it and it'd be exactly the same or better. I knew I'd get a ton of people trying to *got you* me by pointing out my example is old, but it absolutely still happens. I just don't want to fill my post with Shadowbringers spoilers because unlike ARR it's actually genuinely great sometimes and I don't want to ruin that for anyone.
    It's not even good pacing for an MMO. FF14 just has an amazing story that you have to do completely mundane stuff to progress. It could almost be billed as a whole new type of interactive storytelling experience. That's not to say the mmo aspects of the game aren't good, but they're only present in the questing portion of the game when it forces you to group up which honestly just annoys me at that point because I'm vibing on the story even though group play is why I started.
        This has been updated. They recently cut out many meaningless quests to make this part of the game more enjoyable.
            I played through post-patch ARR recently, and while I wouldn't call many of the quests *meaningless* exactly, it's still wayyyyyy longer and slower than it needs to be, especially post-ARR/pre-Heavensward.
            Yeah they cut some stuff but only so much that it went from absolutely absurd to slightly ridiculous.
    Which is from ARR, the worst part of FF14 and also not what he was referring to. He explicitly calls out 3 of the 4 expansions as being better stories. 

ARR needs to get a full revamp, it very much does not sell what kind of game the rest of the game is, which is a shame because it's most people's first taste.
FFXIV is exactly like that. I played through arr and some of the bridge content before the first expansion. There were plenty of times I was doing grindy, repetitive stuff to level up so I could do the next main quest mission. It had more of a cohesive story than other mmo's, but it was very much still an MMO. And who can forget dungeon: the movie? I was grinding that for some cosmetic event with a friend and I swear we spent more time watching a movie than actually controlling our characters. 

And let's be honest, the story in arr wasn't really anything great. It was pretty standard stuff and predictable as hell. Compare that to other ff's and it just pales in complexity, character development, and originality. Maybe the expansions improved, but the core game was only a 7\10 at best for an RPG story. 

I could go on about what I think is the right and wrong way to do MMO stories, out what makes a good singlet player story vs MMO, but I won't.
    Are you of the impression that this is controversial? ARR is a solid "Ok.". It really is nothing more. 

Get through Shadowbringers and Endwalker, and I have now played the best story, characters both friends and villains, soundtrack and writing in all of FF. Possibly my favorite in all gaming.
    ARR is barely even the prologue of the game. FF14 dramatically changes in quality from Heavensward on. It's not considered the best mmorpg for nothing.
    Literally nobody talking about how good FF14 is refers to ARR. The guy literally said Heavensward, Endwalker and Shadowbringers.
    You played the worst bits of the game and didn't touch any of the actual stuff that FFXIV won a shit ton of awards for. Everyone agrees that there are a lot of low points in the game, but the highs are well up there, enough to make FFXIV in the top 3 of FF, even the best for many people.
        The worst bits of the game comprise the entire first 50-ish hours of mandatory content. I like FFXIV but I really can't blame anyone for dropping out during or right after ARR because it's boring, long, and mandatory. It's an extremely valid criticism of the game.
    I don't think many FFXIV will disagree with you that ARR's story was okay at best. However Heavensward, Shadowbringers and Endwalker are definiately what people will think of when they talk about FFXIV's amazing story. I'll say that FFXIV has hit a groove in 'how' they tell the story, but this 'how' isn't really for everyone.
    ARR is not what people talk about when they describe FFXIV as a really good story. And the game is nine years old and has very much learned from it's early iteration.
I just plain stopped in the original.  Didn't remember a single thing that happened one day, had no attachment to a single character.  I just had no idea why I was playing.  I replayed the Royal and it definitely clicked more... that being said, I'm still not much of a fan.  The combat was super lacking, and the story needed a ton of editing.  And the game movement just took forever.  I got tired every time I hit a new zone.
XV didn't fail but it probably did lasting damage to the brand being the second mediocre Final Fantasy after XIII (with XIV 1.0 wreaking havoc in the background where the single player fans couldn't see). It still had the "Versus XIII was the real game" hype behind it at release which was hype that started in a time when there was more reverence for the Final Fantasy franchise. XVI is the first one that has to deal with the consequences of XIII and XV's mixed reception.
    For the hard-core fans probably, but people don't like to admit that FF is a very broad appeal franchise, with the majority being casual fans.  It's the most mainstream JRPG by a wide margin.  Each mainline game just needs cutting edge graphics, and it'll sell like hotcakes
The linear ending was annoying gameplay wise, especially not knowing you’d be stuck there till it’s over, but story-wise it really kicked the shit out of me lol

Though it’s nice they let you go back for endgame
Seems pretty standard for the start of any RPG, can't be taking down bosses the size of gods asscrack right out of the gate, you gotta be collecting 10 bear asses and giving some herbs you found on the floor to old lady dithers to treat her back pain.
i knew there was a decent amount of hate, but i think its mostly just cause its so different of a game from the classic FFs. doesnt appeal to the same type of person i guess
    The release hate was justified. The most complete edition (Royal edition I think?) adds so much content and extra context that I would say the game deserved a re-review. The base game was missing so much.
    >doesnt appeal to the same type of person i guess

Nah its more it just wasn't fleshed out enough, there brilliance under the surface but the game just skips past it.

For example a big moment should have been Ignis going blind, yet the how is completely skipped over devaluing the drama that comes from it.

XV is decent, better than some others in the series, but the development hell it went through absolutely marred the final product in a big way.
    In my experience the hate isn't due to any inherent negative with the gameplay, characters, or story. It's that they put the story out in a movie, anime, and other random places rather than in-game. Then rushed through the in-game story. Then to top it all off, canceled half the DLC which would have completed the story.
It's dumb in kind of a smart way (well, at least they try to make it so).   

There is a reason character interactions in the beginning are so weird and outlandish.
Same. I even own the Collectors Edition of World of Final Fantasy.
As I understand it, this was a error and they've stated FFXVI will not be releasing on PC, at least not on day 1.
Sure, but are those other JRPG at least 3D? Fidelity is part of art direction, Triangle Strategy and GoT might be similar thematically, but still feel very different to me.

I was just wondering if there are games that look close to XVI, because it appeals to me a lot.
Oh I'd totally agree it just felt like 12 was sort of a weird experiment that although it's easy to see how it inspired what came after it, was still different enough that I felt like I shouldn't say 12 and beyond, but honestly you're right.
I found the opposite. If you left the AI in control of the makes then they would chew through your MP far faster than it would replenish. 7R didn't even bother having the AI use MP.
Yep agreed, and those were also some of my favorites (including Persona for me). I mean I don't begrudge them for changing the style and I'm not out here shaking my fist saying they need to go back; if it's making them more money etc. that's just the way things evolve sometimes and I get that, it's just personally I'm not a fan.
Yeah if the question is just whether or not the characters are dudely then zidane and squall definitely don't qualify as dudely. Squalls got enough edgy bad boy vibes so he doesn't seem androgynous to me and Zidane is like a weird monkey boy who I wouldn't call manly but he's very boyish.
>Vaan's the guy you walk around as outside of combat

He's the errand boy
He was added post Matsuno basically as the character the player could identify with instead of a dude in his mid 30s - I can't remember if Basch or Balthier was meant to be the player character early on. Everything rotates around Ashe though.
    Basch was the original main
Doesn't get that much breast and cleavage in Fire Emblem Three Houses
    Nah, but Heroes more than makes up for it
I'm pretty sure that's for Final Fantasy Type-0, not FFXVI
Yep!
It was about stopping chaos?
Yeah, >!dunno how they got away with some dude putting a gun in his mouth and pulling the trigger with a T rating tbh.!<
    Yoshi-P's team has mastered the art of "implying but not showing" in FFXIV. You never actually seen the guy put the gun in his mouth, but the audience could put two and a two together within the context.
    A guy shot himself on-screen in Insomniac's Spider-Man and that got a T.
Which scene was this?
    Poor Tesleen.
Me and my friends joined just before the pandemic kicked off and its been a wild ride. I already enjoyed the game but once I reached shadowbringers it became an all-time classic rivalling the rose-tinted glasses of the other games. Endwalker launch was a special time for me too, theres a great feeling of community running along the main quests with all the other players, and its great just being able to pop on a few times a year to catch up on content rather than feeling obligated to be on every single day.
    Endwalker was my first time being truly caught up to MSQ. There's a certain *je ne sais quo* about going through an area and seeing two dozen people in the same innocuous spot, all watching a cutscene.

I sped through the entire expansion in a week, and to this day I still think >!Ultima Thule is one of the most beautifully haunting area in the game, if not in games period.!<
        That last walk was one of the heaviest things I’ve seen from a game.
there is a free trial you can play the base game and first expansion up to level 60. I hear it's critically acclaimed....
    Specifically speaking the trial takes you through one of the best story arcs in the game with the Heavansward expansion, it will give you a really good idea if the game is something you want to continue
It does
> Does it still require a monthly subscription?

The game has multiple expansions

A Realm Reborn > Heavensward > Stormblood > Shadowbringers > Endwalker.

You get to play ARR and HW for free, which should last you about 200 hours. ARR is a bit slow, but HW has a great story.
    Another note is that if you buy Endwalker you get all the previous expansions with it. Only ever need to buy the latest expac, and you get all of them.
        But if you buy the game keep in mind that you can't access the trial anymore. So you should play until lvl 60 and finish heavensword and then buy the game
Nothing to really "catch up" with if your main draw is the campagin. Just go at it at your own pace and enjoy one of the best rides in video games.
    Yeah been playing it at a pretty slow pace for over a year and am at Endwalker, been an incredible experience and I'm really glad I haven't rushed myself.
    Sure but when you have friends talk you into it like most of the time when you get into an MMO and everyone's excited about this new expansion coming or that new patch and then it's like cool but in a year and a half you can be there.
The thing is, unlike WoW, the "real game" game isn't at the end. The game is the journey as well as the destination. It's amazing.


You can even join a guild (Free Company) and they can *join you* in the biggest moments, their levels getting synced down without making the content completely trivial for people who haven't seen it a million times. It's just a really fun game that goes on and on and on. ...Once you get through most of ARR. Ooph.
    I agree the story experience is breathtaking, but even then the actual gameplay during questing is somehow even less engaging than leveling usually is, and I could not stand how on one hand the game was constantly making me disband my party to do certain quests but then on the other hand would make me join other big parties to do others, and some of those big group quests would be brain dead dungeons or they'd be challenging raids that you actually needed to study up on to get past. It's like I had to both care and not care more than I wanted to the whole time.

But again when you really were into the story it's like you could've dropped all the gameplay and just traveled from story beat to story beat. Whatever quests had you actually do felt like afterthoughts.
        Oh 100%. One of the things I miss from WoW is how clever and variable the quests got over time. Still simple stuff, but different.


14 has some neat stuff but it comes later on in the form of solo duties, and those and few and far between. Many agree basically solo boss fights. There was one brilliant and memorable one in Endwalker, though.
        I think the core problem is the first 2 expansions, despite their attempts to fix them (it’s been over a year for me, maybe 2?) are a real slog story wise IMO.

So unless you can skip through it but still get the story to lead into the other stuff it’s a big ask for a casual player. But they’re doing something right so my archmchair analysis is worth less than a grain of salt.
> It'll just take half a year of casual play to catch up.

Way more. The main campaign that gets you to max level alone is what, 600 hours long?

I no lifed it last year, from ARR to the end of Endwalker, and it took me 2 months to finish it.

But the MSQ is the game's strongest point by far so that's fine. It's a fantastic story.
    It really is.
Oh, there’s always something you can spend your time on, but none of it is mandatory. You can always get caught up in short order if you step away for a time.
    Same is true for WoW as well. Return at the start of a new patch and you have a bunch of catchup mechanics.
I usually just put FF14 off for a few months and come back when there’s a few major patches of content to get through. I don’t really see it as an MMO you keep coming back to every day. At least unless you really love the world and get sucked into every side activity. 

Even the endgame’s progression is very short once you’re there, so it doesn’t feel like you need to stay subscribed for months.
Sure--that makes total sense to me.

I've also been a Final Fantasy fan since the original in the 80s, though, so 14 was an easy and nostalgic sell for me when I transitioned.
It's hard to single out most of the main party but I'd probably throw Thancred in there too. Starts off as the "cool playboy" type and really gets some fantastic depth by the end of Shadowbringers.
    Special mention to Alphinaud throughout Heavensward. He was ablittle shit in A Realm Reborn, but he grew into a far more likeable person by the end. His growth as he became more humble was well done.
        Hell Alisaie too. She went from being stuffed into a highly optional raid series to being her own character who stands apart from her brother.
            Oh yes, getting to spend more time with her was one of the best parts of Stormblood.

But Alisale wasnt ablittle shit like her twin lol
                It was honestly the highlight for me. I love both the twins now, they really balance each other out. It was great finally getting to know her. They're really playing the long-form format well, having minor characters reappear from years ago to become lead roles, >!and also having leading characters retire to side ones as they do their own things!< really makes the world feel alive and natural. Its the same reason One Piece feels like such a grand adventure.
    From Playboy Thancred to Depressed Dadcred
    The stuff with him and Ryne is so so fucking good. Maybe my absolute favorite moment in ShB is the scene with him in the graveyard though.
Dragon Quest does this, it actually tends to work pretty well.
I know Xenoblade 2 used accents to highlight where a character came from. The Blades typically had an American accent (from metropolitan to valley girl to high school venacular), people from the more agriculturally focused Gormott had Welsh accents, or the people from Mor Ardain had Scottish accents. This feature sort of carried on in Xenoblade 3 (since it follows XC1 and 2).
Final Fantasy IX had a great localisation IMO which used different accents etc (although obviously it's not voiced).
The remixes in Endwalker of other expansion songs were great at repurposing the vibes of the original songs with adding new character to them.  Really well done by those composers and the team.
I’ve had this game in my steam library for ages. Is this some kind underperforming inferior version? I know nothing about it other than buying it ages ago.
    The PC version is perfectly fine, it runs very well and works right out of the box with controllers too (you may have to switch to controller control setting and max the graphics first). Funnily enough, it was considered probably the only good JRPG port on PC for years upon years despite the game itself not being hot.

The remastered version on console moves it to Unreal Engine 4 and honestly it's very impressive how much of UE4 they shoved into it without it looking like a rush job. And it also adds a super-sprint mode that lets you run in the overworld sections MUCH faster... that's it.
The PC port doesn't really run at 4k either so you're not missing anything. I have both, the console versions have better lighting while the pc version has better framerates.
I liked FFXV!

Bad Final Fantasy game but great camping with your buddies simulator.
    Ffxv is a interesting “failure”. For like every part it does well there’s 3 parts that are poorly developed.

But I think it’s the best FF game to establish the party as a real group. As opposed to a band of characters joining together for a common goal. Like they really were friends and it was obvious.

The campfire scene in the end of the game I think is a payoff worthy of getting through some of the slog that is the game.

Great world, lore, just poorly connected and told. I would love for them to redo it one day the way properly.
    I really like it too but they pretty blatantly gave up on the game/world halfway through their DLC plans. I think we ultimately got 4/7 character DLCs and one ok MP DLC. There's quite a bit of that story they deliberately left out.
    FFXV flirting with magical realism for its world is infinitely more interesting to me than the drab fantasy world for FFXVI.  I don't fault anyone for liking it though and wanting a return to that type of setting given it's integral to the series' history.
> after how FFXV was (understandably) received.

And FF13, and FF13-2, and FF13-3, and to some extent FF12.   
They really need to restore people faith in mainline non MMO Final Fantasy games.
Some of you act like Nomura killed your families.
    In another timeline he might have!!
        He kills your family in a random card battler side game off the main series
            that ends up being pivotal to the plot for the next decade
        I bet it was actually his nobody Romnuxa traveling between worldlines with the power of waking. Easy mistake to make
        Underrated comment. Next thing you know, Donald and Goofy will show up!
    My family died in the pouch and zipper wars so he did.
    Nomura didn't kill my family, he just won't leave my damn house.
>Game has nothing to do with Nomura, he's not even remotely involved

reddit: GRRR NOMURA
    Nomura is writing the last 2 books of ASOIF? The delayed release makes so much sense now...
Nomura has had some kind of creative input in nearly every single good thing that Square Enix has ever created.

Why the hate?
    Nomura to me is like Zack Snyder, dude is really good at what made his name (Nomura a character designer, Snyder was a director of photography) but when they started to get director roles, that's when it got meh.

I think that the first 2 KH games are good, but that's it. Everything else that he was involved as a director is sub par, but when he gets to just design things, he does a good job.
        kingdom hearts is really the only series he's directed, sans the f7 remake, but he wasn't responsible for the unpopular changes to its narrative despite people thinking it. even seems like most don't realize how much he contributed to the original

his work as producer/concept creator also extends to twewy and stranger of paradise, both of which are good!
            TWEWY’s design is top notch
        I don’t even think he’s a bad director per se, but he reminds me a bit of George Lucas where he needs someone to keep his ideas in check. I love KH1 and 2, along with the VII remake, and he’s not the primary writer on any of those. He’s got a good eye for visual flair, generally fun gameplay decisions and can come up with some interesting plot points, but he needs a good writer and producer to reign him in or it just goes off the rails and becomes too much.
It feels to me that Square has tons of talented people out in their company, but has difficulty reigning them in and making them focus. I think sometimes it is a clash of creative egos (which happens a lot in creative spaces, music, film, animation, etc.), sometimes it is mismanagement by the guys in charge, lack of understanding of certain technologies (i.e. FFXIII), or sometimes it is having too grand of a focus that is difficult to translate to a game (i.e. KH3, FFXV/VSXIII). FFXIV was successful partially because Yoshi P and his team found that the 1.0 team, though talented lacked focus and that sometimes caused chaos.
Agree completely. The game was terrific until then. Terrible after
Yes, and the last build was a rush job. That's what I meant by that.
Definitely mixed - it’s actually my personal favorite. Depends on who you ask
It's a little disingenuous to use their earliest content as the benchmark for CBU3 instead of the all recent stuff that they've won piles of awards for. There are of course obvious limitations to the gameplay and storytelling as a consequence of FFXIV being built on a decade old MMO, but the real meat of FFXIV's story succeeds on it's own merits. You could rip it all out of the MMO and build a (very long) singleplayer mainline title out of it with minimal adjustments (Mostly just getting rid of the filler quests), and it would still be phenomenal.
    >You could rip it all out of the MMO and build a (very long) singleplayer mainline title out of it with minimal adjustments

People really underestimate how long the MSQ is. People regularly complain about JRPGs breaking the 40 hour mark, and that includes gameplay. FF14 is over 20 hours of cutscene time \*per expansion.\*

[https://www.reddit.com/user/Cyberfunk3/comments/y5gauf/ffxiv\_tracker\_62\_update\_improved\_formatting/](https://www.reddit.com/user/Cyberfunk3/comments/y5gauf/ffxiv_tracker_62_update_improved_formatting/)

A quick eyeballing of time says I 100%'d the Pixel Remasters of 1 through 4 (\~115 hours) in less time than it takes to watch cutscenes in FF14 (\~123 hours). That's watching the extended version of the LotR trilogy 10 times, and still leaving time for bathroom breaks! If you could play all of the MSQ cutscenes sequentially without having to do dungeons and walk places between them, you'd be able to put the controller/mouse down for \*five days.\*

This is tolerable when you're playing it as it comes out, but don't undersell how gargantuanly long the story is, or how much of an advantage the MMO format breaking up these story sections over literal years helps.
        Yeah I recently created an alt and just finished the 2.0 content. Sure the story content itself is about 20 hours, and I'm honestly okay with that, but I broke it up with a *lot* of side content. I leveled all my crafters, did every blue quest I came across, and, in general, lollygagged around for days just enjoying myself. Play time came out to around 80 or 90 hours by the time I cleared Praetorium.

And it still felt like it went by in the blink of an eye. So when people say they "slogged" through ARR I just question how out of touch I must be with those players to have genuinely enjoyed myself so thoroughly for like 4-5x the length of time it probably took them to do it. Or maybe just enjoying the content on offer rather than forcing yourself to binge the MSQ is the key to having fun with it after all. Who knows? I definitely agree that people downplay how much the MMO aspect helps that long stretch of story *work*. The world wouldn't be as interesting without it. Your achievements wouldn't mean as much. A solo version of FFXIV wouldn't really be the same.
            Well, for me 80 to 90 hours of playtime means about six months in real life, so the idea of levelling crafters (or BOT/MIN) without being able to fly or having a huge bank (i.e. spending a lot of time walking everywhere) is not that appealing to me. Different strokes for different folks, but I’m happy that I rushed the MSQ (some friends of mine just decided to buy the ARR quest skip instead) this time instead of bailing halfaway through because the downtime to meaningful content ratio was too high.

Persona 5 was for me a game that while long (first playthrough took me 120 hours spread throughout a year), stroke a good balance of having content interspersed with good fluff. So far post-ARR seems to be working out well enough for me, but I’m afraid it might be a couple of years until I actually get to Endwalker.
    I picked the Titan thing because it's a particularly egregious example and I'm trying to go lighter on spoilers for newer content. But there are absolutely places in Shadowbringers and Endwalker where massive forward momentum for important characters and the plot in general screech to a wailing halt so that we can meet brand new people who don't matter and spent waaaaay too long, say, building robots in the desert with them instead of actually completing someone's story arc. 

Again, I'm not saying 14 is bad and I'm not saying it doesn't hit hard when things are firing on all cylinders. But to make the point that it doesn't feel like an MMO with a ton of filler quests in hubs to pad out the runtime is absurd.
        They fixed this part in recent updates though I thought.
            The specific thing I'm talking about in this post happens in Shadowbringers, so I doubt it. I know there was a pass at some point to cut down on some of the fluff in the really old content but I suspect they didn't get rid of all of it.
                As someone who very recently finished ARR, it's still so slow and bloated (especially the patch quests) that it's almost hard to believe it used to be worse.
        Yeah almost every major event is precluded by a lot of meaningless quests where you gather something or have to travel someplace to talk to someone else only to then fo back to the first place
I haven't forgot it at all, trust me we FF14 fans remember it all too well lol (hell, the part in Return from Ivalice that's an ill-considered parody of the Titan questline was recently cut from the game because everyone hated that bit too).

But in a game that has spanned 9 years with 300+ hours of main story content and 100s of hours of side story content, the fact you're reaching for one of the earliest questlines in what is universally agreed to be the weakest part of the game that doesn't hold a candle to ShB and EW actually proves my point as much as anything.

And yeah I'm not claiming every single quest in that 300+ hours is a masterpiece, the pacing can be fairly slow at times and occasionally you can get quests that border on padding (level 88 Sharlayan...) but these moments pale in comparison to MSQ meaningfully pushing the story forward in some way or another.
    I like how you say "we FF14 fans" like I'm not one of you. I didn't beat Endwalker because I hate the game or the story. But people come out of the woodwork to chop your head off if you imply anything is wrong with the plot.

You could cut *a lot* out of it and it'd be exactly the same or better. I knew I'd get a ton of people trying to *got you* me by pointing out my example is old, but it absolutely still happens. I just don't want to fill my post with Shadowbringers spoilers because unlike ARR it's actually genuinely great sometimes and I don't want to ruin that for anyone.
It's not even good pacing for an MMO. FF14 just has an amazing story that you have to do completely mundane stuff to progress. It could almost be billed as a whole new type of interactive storytelling experience. That's not to say the mmo aspects of the game aren't good, but they're only present in the questing portion of the game when it forces you to group up which honestly just annoys me at that point because I'm vibing on the story even though group play is why I started.
    This has been updated. They recently cut out many meaningless quests to make this part of the game more enjoyable.
        I played through post-patch ARR recently, and while I wouldn't call many of the quests *meaningless* exactly, it's still wayyyyyy longer and slower than it needs to be, especially post-ARR/pre-Heavensward.
        Yeah they cut some stuff but only so much that it went from absolutely absurd to slightly ridiculous.
Which is from ARR, the worst part of FF14 and also not what he was referring to. He explicitly calls out 3 of the 4 expansions as being better stories. 

ARR needs to get a full revamp, it very much does not sell what kind of game the rest of the game is, which is a shame because it's most people's first taste.
Are you of the impression that this is controversial? ARR is a solid "Ok.". It really is nothing more. 

Get through Shadowbringers and Endwalker, and I have now played the best story, characters both friends and villains, soundtrack and writing in all of FF. Possibly my favorite in all gaming.
ARR is barely even the prologue of the game. FF14 dramatically changes in quality from Heavensward on. It's not considered the best mmorpg for nothing.
Literally nobody talking about how good FF14 is refers to ARR. The guy literally said Heavensward, Endwalker and Shadowbringers.
You played the worst bits of the game and didn't touch any of the actual stuff that FFXIV won a shit ton of awards for. Everyone agrees that there are a lot of low points in the game, but the highs are well up there, enough to make FFXIV in the top 3 of FF, even the best for many people.
    The worst bits of the game comprise the entire first 50-ish hours of mandatory content. I like FFXIV but I really can't blame anyone for dropping out during or right after ARR because it's boring, long, and mandatory. It's an extremely valid criticism of the game.
I don't think many FFXIV will disagree with you that ARR's story was okay at best. However Heavensward, Shadowbringers and Endwalker are definiately what people will think of when they talk about FFXIV's amazing story. I'll say that FFXIV has hit a groove in 'how' they tell the story, but this 'how' isn't really for everyone.
ARR is not what people talk about when they describe FFXIV as a really good story. And the game is nine years old and has very much learned from it's early iteration.
For the hard-core fans probably, but people don't like to admit that FF is a very broad appeal franchise, with the majority being casual fans.  It's the most mainstream JRPG by a wide margin.  Each mainline game just needs cutting edge graphics, and it'll sell like hotcakes
The release hate was justified. The most complete edition (Royal edition I think?) adds so much content and extra context that I would say the game deserved a re-review. The base game was missing so much.
>doesnt appeal to the same type of person i guess

Nah its more it just wasn't fleshed out enough, there brilliance under the surface but the game just skips past it.

For example a big moment should have been Ignis going blind, yet the how is completely skipped over devaluing the drama that comes from it.

XV is decent, better than some others in the series, but the development hell it went through absolutely marred the final product in a big way.
In my experience the hate isn't due to any inherent negative with the gameplay, characters, or story. It's that they put the story out in a movie, anime, and other random places rather than in-game. Then rushed through the in-game story. Then to top it all off, canceled half the DLC which would have completed the story.
Basch was the original main
Nah, but Heroes more than makes up for it
Yoshi-P's team has mastered the art of "implying but not showing" in FFXIV. You never actually seen the guy put the gun in his mouth, but the audience could put two and a two together within the context.
A guy shot himself on-screen in Insomniac's Spider-Man and that got a T.
Poor Tesleen.
Endwalker was my first time being truly caught up to MSQ. There's a certain *je ne sais quo* about going through an area and seeing two dozen people in the same innocuous spot, all watching a cutscene.

I sped through the entire expansion in a week, and to this day I still think >!Ultima Thule is one of the most beautifully haunting area in the game, if not in games period.!<
    That last walk was one of the heaviest things I’ve seen from a game.
Specifically speaking the trial takes you through one of the best story arcs in the game with the Heavansward expansion, it will give you a really good idea if the game is something you want to continue
Another note is that if you buy Endwalker you get all the previous expansions with it. Only ever need to buy the latest expac, and you get all of them.
    But if you buy the game keep in mind that you can't access the trial anymore. So you should play until lvl 60 and finish heavensword and then buy the game
Yeah been playing it at a pretty slow pace for over a year and am at Endwalker, been an incredible experience and I'm really glad I haven't rushed myself.
Sure but when you have friends talk you into it like most of the time when you get into an MMO and everyone's excited about this new expansion coming or that new patch and then it's like cool but in a year and a half you can be there.
I agree the story experience is breathtaking, but even then the actual gameplay during questing is somehow even less engaging than leveling usually is, and I could not stand how on one hand the game was constantly making me disband my party to do certain quests but then on the other hand would make me join other big parties to do others, and some of those big group quests would be brain dead dungeons or they'd be challenging raids that you actually needed to study up on to get past. It's like I had to both care and not care more than I wanted to the whole time.

But again when you really were into the story it's like you could've dropped all the gameplay and just traveled from story beat to story beat. Whatever quests had you actually do felt like afterthoughts.
    Oh 100%. One of the things I miss from WoW is how clever and variable the quests got over time. Still simple stuff, but different.


14 has some neat stuff but it comes later on in the form of solo duties, and those and few and far between. Many agree basically solo boss fights. There was one brilliant and memorable one in Endwalker, though.
    I think the core problem is the first 2 expansions, despite their attempts to fix them (it’s been over a year for me, maybe 2?) are a real slog story wise IMO.

So unless you can skip through it but still get the story to lead into the other stuff it’s a big ask for a casual player. But they’re doing something right so my archmchair analysis is worth less than a grain of salt.
It really is.
Same is true for WoW as well. Return at the start of a new patch and you have a bunch of catchup mechanics.
Special mention to Alphinaud throughout Heavensward. He was ablittle shit in A Realm Reborn, but he grew into a far more likeable person by the end. His growth as he became more humble was well done.
    Hell Alisaie too. She went from being stuffed into a highly optional raid series to being her own character who stands apart from her brother.
        Oh yes, getting to spend more time with her was one of the best parts of Stormblood.

But Alisale wasnt ablittle shit like her twin lol
            It was honestly the highlight for me. I love both the twins now, they really balance each other out. It was great finally getting to know her. They're really playing the long-form format well, having minor characters reappear from years ago to become lead roles, >!and also having leading characters retire to side ones as they do their own things!< really makes the world feel alive and natural. Its the same reason One Piece feels like such a grand adventure.
From Playboy Thancred to Depressed Dadcred
The stuff with him and Ryne is so so fucking good. Maybe my absolute favorite moment in ShB is the scene with him in the graveyard though.
The PC version is perfectly fine, it runs very well and works right out of the box with controllers too (you may have to switch to controller control setting and max the graphics first). Funnily enough, it was considered probably the only good JRPG port on PC for years upon years despite the game itself not being hot.

The remastered version on console moves it to Unreal Engine 4 and honestly it's very impressive how much of UE4 they shoved into it without it looking like a rush job. And it also adds a super-sprint mode that lets you run in the overworld sections MUCH faster... that's it.
Ffxv is a interesting “failure”. For like every part it does well there’s 3 parts that are poorly developed.

But I think it’s the best FF game to establish the party as a real group. As opposed to a band of characters joining together for a common goal. Like they really were friends and it was obvious.

The campfire scene in the end of the game I think is a payoff worthy of getting through some of the slog that is the game.

Great world, lore, just poorly connected and told. I would love for them to redo it one day the way properly.
I really like it too but they pretty blatantly gave up on the game/world halfway through their DLC plans. I think we ultimately got 4/7 character DLCs and one ok MP DLC. There's quite a bit of that story they deliberately left out.
FFXV flirting with magical realism for its world is infinitely more interesting to me than the drab fantasy world for FFXVI.  I don't fault anyone for liking it though and wanting a return to that type of setting given it's integral to the series' history.
In another timeline he might have!!
    He kills your family in a random card battler side game off the main series
        that ends up being pivotal to the plot for the next decade
    I bet it was actually his nobody Romnuxa traveling between worldlines with the power of waking. Easy mistake to make
    Underrated comment. Next thing you know, Donald and Goofy will show up!
My family died in the pouch and zipper wars so he did.
Nomura didn't kill my family, he just won't leave my damn house.
Nomura is writing the last 2 books of ASOIF? The delayed release makes so much sense now...
Nomura to me is like Zack Snyder, dude is really good at what made his name (Nomura a character designer, Snyder was a director of photography) but when they started to get director roles, that's when it got meh.

I think that the first 2 KH games are good, but that's it. Everything else that he was involved as a director is sub par, but when he gets to just design things, he does a good job.
    kingdom hearts is really the only series he's directed, sans the f7 remake, but he wasn't responsible for the unpopular changes to its narrative despite people thinking it. even seems like most don't realize how much he contributed to the original

his work as producer/concept creator also extends to twewy and stranger of paradise, both of which are good!
        TWEWY’s design is top notch
    I don’t even think he’s a bad director per se, but he reminds me a bit of George Lucas where he needs someone to keep his ideas in check. I love KH1 and 2, along with the VII remake, and he’s not the primary writer on any of those. He’s got a good eye for visual flair, generally fun gameplay decisions and can come up with some interesting plot points, but he needs a good writer and producer to reign him in or it just goes off the rails and becomes too much.
>You could rip it all out of the MMO and build a (very long) singleplayer mainline title out of it with minimal adjustments

People really underestimate how long the MSQ is. People regularly complain about JRPGs breaking the 40 hour mark, and that includes gameplay. FF14 is over 20 hours of cutscene time \*per expansion.\*

[https://www.reddit.com/user/Cyberfunk3/comments/y5gauf/ffxiv\_tracker\_62\_update\_improved\_formatting/](https://www.reddit.com/user/Cyberfunk3/comments/y5gauf/ffxiv_tracker_62_update_improved_formatting/)

A quick eyeballing of time says I 100%'d the Pixel Remasters of 1 through 4 (\~115 hours) in less time than it takes to watch cutscenes in FF14 (\~123 hours). That's watching the extended version of the LotR trilogy 10 times, and still leaving time for bathroom breaks! If you could play all of the MSQ cutscenes sequentially without having to do dungeons and walk places between them, you'd be able to put the controller/mouse down for \*five days.\*

This is tolerable when you're playing it as it comes out, but don't undersell how gargantuanly long the story is, or how much of an advantage the MMO format breaking up these story sections over literal years helps.
    Yeah I recently created an alt and just finished the 2.0 content. Sure the story content itself is about 20 hours, and I'm honestly okay with that, but I broke it up with a *lot* of side content. I leveled all my crafters, did every blue quest I came across, and, in general, lollygagged around for days just enjoying myself. Play time came out to around 80 or 90 hours by the time I cleared Praetorium.

And it still felt like it went by in the blink of an eye. So when people say they "slogged" through ARR I just question how out of touch I must be with those players to have genuinely enjoyed myself so thoroughly for like 4-5x the length of time it probably took them to do it. Or maybe just enjoying the content on offer rather than forcing yourself to binge the MSQ is the key to having fun with it after all. Who knows? I definitely agree that people downplay how much the MMO aspect helps that long stretch of story *work*. The world wouldn't be as interesting without it. Your achievements wouldn't mean as much. A solo version of FFXIV wouldn't really be the same.
        Well, for me 80 to 90 hours of playtime means about six months in real life, so the idea of levelling crafters (or BOT/MIN) without being able to fly or having a huge bank (i.e. spending a lot of time walking everywhere) is not that appealing to me. Different strokes for different folks, but I’m happy that I rushed the MSQ (some friends of mine just decided to buy the ARR quest skip instead) this time instead of bailing halfaway through because the downtime to meaningful content ratio was too high.

Persona 5 was for me a game that while long (first playthrough took me 120 hours spread throughout a year), stroke a good balance of having content interspersed with good fluff. So far post-ARR seems to be working out well enough for me, but I’m afraid it might be a couple of years until I actually get to Endwalker.
I picked the Titan thing because it's a particularly egregious example and I'm trying to go lighter on spoilers for newer content. But there are absolutely places in Shadowbringers and Endwalker where massive forward momentum for important characters and the plot in general screech to a wailing halt so that we can meet brand new people who don't matter and spent waaaaay too long, say, building robots in the desert with them instead of actually completing someone's story arc. 

Again, I'm not saying 14 is bad and I'm not saying it doesn't hit hard when things are firing on all cylinders. But to make the point that it doesn't feel like an MMO with a ton of filler quests in hubs to pad out the runtime is absurd.
    They fixed this part in recent updates though I thought.
        The specific thing I'm talking about in this post happens in Shadowbringers, so I doubt it. I know there was a pass at some point to cut down on some of the fluff in the really old content but I suspect they didn't get rid of all of it.
            As someone who very recently finished ARR, it's still so slow and bloated (especially the patch quests) that it's almost hard to believe it used to be worse.
    Yeah almost every major event is precluded by a lot of meaningless quests where you gather something or have to travel someplace to talk to someone else only to then fo back to the first place
I like how you say "we FF14 fans" like I'm not one of you. I didn't beat Endwalker because I hate the game or the story. But people come out of the woodwork to chop your head off if you imply anything is wrong with the plot.

You could cut *a lot* out of it and it'd be exactly the same or better. I knew I'd get a ton of people trying to *got you* me by pointing out my example is old, but it absolutely still happens. I just don't want to fill my post with Shadowbringers spoilers because unlike ARR it's actually genuinely great sometimes and I don't want to ruin that for anyone.
This has been updated. They recently cut out many meaningless quests to make this part of the game more enjoyable.
    I played through post-patch ARR recently, and while I wouldn't call many of the quests *meaningless* exactly, it's still wayyyyyy longer and slower than it needs to be, especially post-ARR/pre-Heavensward.
    Yeah they cut some stuff but only so much that it went from absolutely absurd to slightly ridiculous.
The worst bits of the game comprise the entire first 50-ish hours of mandatory content. I like FFXIV but I really can't blame anyone for dropping out during or right after ARR because it's boring, long, and mandatory. It's an extremely valid criticism of the game.
