The idea that Ifrit Risen is just Clive giving Joshua a piggyback ride is wonderful. XD
    All it needs is to have Joshua flail his arms windmill style.
        "I'm gonna be waving my arms around and walking towards you. If you get hurt, it's your own fault" kinda vibes
    Totally gave me Gurren Lagann vibes when Kamina and Simon combined for the first time
        SAAAAAAAAME and I loved every moment of it!!
This is what kids actually look like when they‚Äôre play fighting Kaiju battles
    this is how i imagine those kids in the ending played that fight with another kid xD
    OMG...WAIT. Was the entire game just two kids LARPing?
        Ending spoilers: >!When you think about it, that kind of has a nice ring to it.!<

>!It would explain the abrupt transitions from largely grounded and gritty political fantasy, to ridiculously over the top, flashy Eikon fights.!<

>!Just the kids getting excited and embellishing the cool parts of the story, the younger kid playing Ifrit also checks out with how Ifrit learns new abilities seemingly at random. Kids love to make up rules on the fly.!<

>!To quote Yoda ‚ÄúTruly wonderful the mind of a child is‚Äù.!<

Added bonus >!The kids going back to playing *War of the Eikons* again, references us starting NG+!<
            I hate that this makes sense.
    As i was going thru the game and fighting some of the other dominants i was like.

Bro this is just gundam with extra steps
Exactly what i was thinking lmao. They're so silly
Now *this* is quality content
That Dion needs to be a cosplay at comic con or something
Joshua t-posing to establish Dominant
    Then Dion T-poses back during Zettaflare and Joshua and Clive were like "HOLY SH\*T HE'S GONNA BURN THE WORLD"
    Joshua has that 'yknw this is kinda embarrassingly dumb but... Ah idgaf we're doing this' face 

While Clive is.. üíØ rawr and committed üòÇ
    Criminally underappreciated response.
It's not wrong, it's not wrong at all! ü§£
Lmfao not Dion sippin on the crystal üòÇ
this is canon.

    # AND IT WAS GLORIOUS!!!
That's honestly accurate. ü§£
awesome depiction of that fight
This kinda explains why the Kulu Ya Ku in MHW gets so strong after hugging an FF crystal (Bird UP!). Dion essentially does the same thing and almost annihilates the world.
Joshua and Dion did know each other as kids, so there's a non-0% chance this actually happened before. Clive would definitely do it if asked because he's just that kind of older brother.
This is so accurate that it hurts
Needed this laugh, the sequence broke me  
Crazy, crazy part of the game
I actually thought Crystal Meth Bahamut would be a Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon/King Ghidorah type of fusion lol.
#THE T-POSE IS STRONG WITH THIS ONE
Always wondered what Crystal juice tastes like. Hmmm...
I love this so much
I love this lmao.
T-Pose Brotherly Combo >> Dragon with lazers for feet and arms.

Its eikon time.
Dion takes BIG SIPPPPP. LMFAOOO
That is‚Ä¶ surprisingly accurate.

Well done! üëç
This reminds me of the snowball fight in Chainsaw Man.
    Pain :')
Ok but accurate
I feel like a requisite for any true Dion cosplay would be a bottle of Crystal Pepsi.
Sibling rivalry at its finest...
It's a fight between bros and step bro.
Well‚Ä¶ yes.
This is just perfect!
Yup, this is cannon
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Lol perfect üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Highly accurate!
Mecha shiva, mecha shiva
I'm here for it!
This picture totally encapsulates the whole thing. Bravo!
This is my favorite Eikon fight for this reason alone
This is incredibly too accurate lol
This is cute
God damn, I laughed out loud in the middle of the night and got told off. This is way to accurate.
I mean‚Ä¶ in a nutshell, yeah. üòÇ
Haha amazing :D
Solid depiction of the fight
I got a lot of DragonBall and DBZ vibes from this fight.
I would've loved to see a RRR sequence of them in their human form like that
Needs more flare (in Christopher Walkens voice)
Lmfao this was blurred out at first, NOT what I expected and so pleasantly surprised
Does artist have twitter or insta?
I would love to see fanart of Hugo Kupka just in his day to day role as financial advisor in some boring office setting.

ü§ì ‚ÄúSir our food stores are depleted and our people are eating sand what should we do‚Äù 

üóø ‚ÄúCANNONS BUY MORE CANNONS WE WILL CRUSH THEM ALL‚Äù 

‚ÄúBUILD ME A PALACE HANGING OVER A GIANT RAVINE‚Äù
Nice art! But see It again...It reminds me




ASCENSION, Classic music starts (best ost of the game for me).
