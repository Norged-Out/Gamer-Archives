“I like Dirge of Cerberus.”

Gets shot instantly
    The shooter in question:

        Bro don't even like his own game 💀
    Point blank in the face with the Death Penalty.
    Holy shit more dirge of Cerberus fans i though I’d never see the day
        I don’t care what anyone says, it’s a fun game lol
    NOMURA PLS WE NEED REMAKE
        I would love a remake just in the sort of level of crisis core, maybe fixing some of the janky shooter mechanics. I never got a chance to play it.
            I liked it, the controllers were a bit stiff but overall, I had a good time
    You know what? I won’t call it a GREAT game, and I won’t call the story worth anything. But the way it was described made it sound way worse than it actually is. Gameplay-wise, it’s a standard arcade cabinet shooter that happens to be on PS2, and those can be kinda fun! Not mindblowing, but there’s way worse video games in the series. It’s definitely subpar in many aspects, but I was expecting the worst game in the series, and there’s way worse than this.
    Man, I really liked Dirge of Cerberus
    !! That was my first FF game beyond KH. 

I had no clue what was going on, but I loved playing it.
        Don't feel bad. Those of us who love and devour everything about the FF7 universe had no clue what was going on either.
    *Teleports behind you* Nothing personal kid!
My first FF was 13.

*gets shot*
    It wasn't my first, but I loved it.
    It’s always fucking me that gets targeted with these 😭
"I don't like ATB "

Crucified.
    Sorry but you're going to have to come with me, you're being detained for further questioning.
    crucify me then DO IT
"XV is my favorite!"
Gets tied to a vehicle and dragged for several miles
    Gets tied to the regalia?
    Come on it’s a solid game and has a nice story that was only held back by the game length
        And the combat, and a development hell, and a Director…
            Idk man if it had a longer story to better flesh it out I don’t think any of those would be such a problem anymore
                The combat would still be a problem tho, as far as I remember before Tabata took over the project, The comment system was going to be similar to kingdom hearts which had me excited, the rebrand happened and Igot less hopeful😅
                    Man, the thing about XV’s combat is that the bones of it are so fuckin’ badass both on paper and visually (at least at first). 

Teleporting to a sword after you throw it? Dope.

Awesome synchronized flourish finisher with all the chocobros? Straight fire.

And then the gamey reality of the systems (or lack of) hit you a few hours in.
            The combat in ff16 is bad now?! 
                No, we’re talking about 15
                Odin is so fun to use
                    funny* odin is funny to use
                        No no. He’s FUN
                Yes. lol it’s so barebones.
        I would say acceptable more than solid. In fact I did not feel the game was solid at all. More like a mousse.
Every franchise gets that way the longer it goes.
    [Insert Newest game] doesn’t “feel” like final fantasy
        I feel like every FF has gotten this from FF6 onwards
            That's interesting to note. If it started with 7 (ive never heard of having people rally against it around its initial PS1 launch) I'd say it's probably around when the heavy marketing of graphics and performance hit mainstream. Sega and Nintendo dabbled in it with their rival marketing for a bit before that, but it absolutely exploded between them after their first generation of rival hardware, and then PlayStation joined in on it and dumped gasoline on the fire. That's when people were firmly forming opinions and started to gather in camps about games. The internet was also on the rise, so more information was also available to help people form opinions on games and genres
            Nah from X onwards. The last time it was turn based
                Nah it's been happening earlier than that. There's always a reason. "not medieval enough", etc.
                Nah the internet was in its early stages but FF6 (or 3 as it was called in the west) vs. FF7 was a real thing. Then shitting on FF8 was a real thing from fans of the previous ones. Then FF9 homaging the older games had the newer fans from 7 and 8 dislike it. 10 is the only entry that was relatively safe from the discourse, but still had its share of haters.

Also I hear that jumping from normal turn-based to atb turn-based was controversial in Japan too so I’m sure the eternal FF fandom war predates this all. Ultimately all the entries switch things up in terms of system and format and genre, irking comfortable type fans unable to adapt to different changes (even though the ever changing nature is the series’ main constant).
                7 absolutely got hate for its strong turn into dieselpunk and sci-fi after 6 flirted with it.

Lot of people felt it wasn't fantasy enough for the franchise.
                There are a few old school FF fans from the SNES era who think the longer cinematics in battle starting 7 ruined the series and the entire genre of JRPGs.
                FF’s first non turn-based (mainline) game was XV. XIII was turn-based, and XI and XIV were turn-based due to that being the MMO standard (it’s just a different idea of turns is all). XII took after XI in some ways and is turn-based, the only difference is that the attack button is automated and you can program your AI to do turns for you. There’s still an ATB bar, if you can’t “press a to swing the sword” then it’s not action-based.

Edited for clarity
    Especially if they keep trying to reinvent the wheel, series with fewer big mechanic changes aren't quite as polarizing between titles.
        Like what Final Fantasy has been doing since X. I know it's a different universe with differing mechanics every time, but combat is even more varied in the games since then.
"Ivalician"

"Okay... What kind of Ivalician? You don't know?" ⚔️
    What if you're both or all three??
    The secret is that EVERY Ivalice game is pretty good, it just depends on HOW good you’re talking.
        I'm sure there are people who think every state in America is pretty cool too
    Never forget Vagrant Story...everyone always forgets about Vagrant Story.
“I prefer VIII over VII.”

*Gets disowned by the fandom.*

Your average FF 8 enjoyer
        This is me, and the OP is how I feel about 9ers
        As a FFVIII hater, you’re right. I only hate it because the story is incomprehensible to me and I don’t like the speedrun-designed combat system. But I can admit that it’s just not my thing, it’s so fucking cool to talk about regardless of whether or not I like playing it.
        https://preview.redd.it/b6e0358i04xc1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e092338514427a21548274b5f7e4e091314ba70a

FIFY
    I did prefer 8 to 7, but I was an ff6 guy. I do like the new remakes, those are fire. I didn’t remember a drop of what happened in 7 anyway, so I had that going for me
    I love VIII and XV, haha.

XVI wasn't my cup of tea though it was still fine and I am glad many people enjoyed it.

The franchise has just so many different games that it is almost impossible for someone to like them all. However, it also means that there is at least something for everybody.
    I have a friend like this. For how much we talk about 4, 6, 7, 9, and 12, I would never expect 8 to be his favorite.

Not gonna lie, made me question what our friendship really is.
    I don't care. That's me.
“X is my favorite”

*Becomes a Blitzball when I grow up*
    X is my favorite and I’m still not a blitzball. I still don’t know what I did wrong.

I only like 16

*gets shot multiple times and teabagged after*
Kitase games vs Yoshi P games
    Tbf, the original divide happened way before Yoshi-P's arrival, and Kitase is now the supervisor of the whole IP (he greenlighted pretty much everything about XVI).

But it sure feels like that in some parts of the fandom nowadays.
    Kitase🤝Yoshi P = making ff16
Enjoying FF is Enjoying FF and that's all that matters man
My first is 16 and my second is Stranger of Para-

*Gets nuked by Bahamut, Ifrit, and Phoenix*
    then stomped on by Odin for additional damage
        Phoenix accidentally raised him so Odin was sent in for the true final kill.
I like Aerith more than Tifa

*My house gets hit by Zettaflare*
    Can't help it
My personal top three games are:

1. Final Fantasy X
2. Crisis Core
3. Final Fantasy XVI

Where do I line up for the bullet to the head?
Only ones I’ve completed are dirge crisis core 15 and soon 16
“I like Stranger of Paradise.”

“My man.” *shakes hand*
    "We've got to kill Chaos!"
The kind that unironically thinks Edward was the best character in FF4?*awaits fate*
    You spoony bard
"I only dislike 2 and 13 of the main games. 15 is passable with the updates."

Marked down as a possible sleeper agent.
No one that hates final fantasy more than final fantasy fans
"FF6 was just okay." 

*Banned*

But seriously, I don't understand why in a franchise of 16 main titles and a ton of side games, remakes, and spin-offs why people aren't allowed to like or dislike any of them unless they're *new*. I'll admit, part of why I didn't like ff6 was because it was hyped up so much that once I actually played it, I was so disappointed. If I had played it years ago or hadn't heard much about it beforehand from overzealous fans who crowned it the 'best Final Fantasy' I probably would have thought it to be a lot better. Not Chrono Trigger levels of amazing, but still good.
    I feel the same way about FF6. I played it a couple of months ago for the first time, after hearing so many people calling it "the best Final Fantasy game", but I ended up dropping it after 12 hours or so. It's not a bad game, but I found it really hard to care about any of the characters, or the story. I like FF4 and 5 better, though.
    When they came out, Chrono Trigger and FF6 were considered close together in quality. But while Chrono Trigger has aged well, FF6 certainly has not. It feels dated in a way the other SNES games don't.
“XIV is my favourite game”

Ballistic missiles shot in my direction
    It is truly a magnificent game tho.
    Pretty much everyone except the hardcore ATB crew that hates everything after 10 and will never like another game in the series has come around on 14. Even the people who don't play it understand.
I like all of them and acknowledge their differences with FF15 & 7 being my favorite.
My first FF game was 7, but I greatly prefer 6.

\>.>  


<.<
"FF16 has a pretty deep combat system."

    I mean it actually does, just there are no enemies where that you can justify using the higher ceiling combos on
        No I mean I get yelled at for saying that LOL
    Elitist moment
Ff12 is my favorite of them all.
    ![gif](giphy|rMAs5XEGZmH3W|downsized)

My man.
I prefer 16 to 7R2.
    Same but you're also getting shot
    This is exactly the scenario I was thinking of when making this
I played 15 for my first one :)
I like X-2! *gun cocks* …But not as much as X.
    X is lower tier for me, and I prefer X-2 for that excellent battle system.
I like final fantasy. Yeah which. One.?

One? No that's not an answer
"Final Fantasy IX is a horribly flawed game and is nowhere near the best."

*\*gets Thanos snapped\**
    Ya 9 sucks bro I’m not waiting 45mins for the battle to load before I can make a decision then wait another 45mins for the computer to register my decision, it’s the only one I haven’t completed because it’s too damn slow
Sorry my first FF game was 16 and I love it. Kingdom Hearts is my first Square Enix game series
I don't like FFX, but I love X-2.
My favorite character is secretly Quina
My first final fantasy every played was
FF Crystal Chronicles the Crystal bearer for the Wii

And have 240 hours in FFXVI

Am I shot?
"FFXII was, and still is, my favorite *Final Fantasy.* Also, I loved XV and XVI in spite of their flaws, and XIII was pretty solid... until Barthandelus. *Fuck Barthandelus*."

Aight, how do I fare then?
    Acceptible. Still hurled an insult at XIII, most of fanbase will forgive you.
        Eh, fair enough. Though I wasn't really throwing shade at XIII, per se. I just *really* hate the Barthandelus fight... 😬
This is how organized religion started.
Hahaha too perfect
Hot takes? Holy shit here we go 

“IV is the 3rd worst mainline game”

“V is better than VI” 

“People hate X because it blows most other titles out of the water”

“Stranger of Paradise is better than Crisis Core, XV, Type-0, and XVI”

“The best classic Final Fantasy game is actually Octopath Traveler”

“XIII has better combat than most turn-based FF’s, and if it weren’t for the level design and translation issues it would be top tier”

“IV: The After Years is one of the worst JRPG’s ever made”

… not sure if the last one is a hot take, most people that I ask hate that game too. But I believe literally all of these.
The one that just plays whichever one they can and feels great when someone shares about their favorites and feels exhausted when any of them just get shot to shit for existing without any recourse.
    Amen
"FF13 is the best one"
7remake project is superior to OG7
My favorite is probably XV... :D
Final Fantasy died when they made it real time combat. 

Is this where I stand to get murdered?
XIII , XV and XVI aren’t gonna get the warmest of welcomes
The XIII Trilogy is pretty damn epic, from the music to the gameplay to the endgame. I let myself get turned off by the reception upon release and didn't play it until 6 years later, but was surprised as hell. I'm glad derision for it has lessened over time, because it is genuinely fun to play.
So far, the only one I didn't like is type -0. 

Really couldn't get into this one.

Otherwise I liked every game I played (3,4, only a few parts of 6 because of a technical problem, 7,8,9,10,12,15,16)
My first and favourite FF was Dissidia.

*Gets killed in an endless loop*
“I prefer the remake trilogy over the OG and ff16 is my number o-“ *get excommunicated the village style*
FFVIII my first and favorite
"XI and XIV aren't real main series FF's"

Spontaneously combusts
"I played X-2" *gets shot, while ghost is flying away* "and i played it nearly a decade before i played FFX" *gets exorcised*
There’s 3 kinds of FF fans. VII fans, XIV fans, and full series fans.
does kingdom hearts count?
    Final fantasy is what you believe final fantasy is
        kingdom hearts magical puzzle clash is my favorite ff game!
You see there’s a difference between being a fan of ff7 and ff12. Me personally I like 7 enough however 9 is my favorite.

![gif](giphy|tJ3F5KvJX7Ak0)
    Sounds like you’re a newb fan…  if you were a real fan you’d have a 1-6 game in your list /s
        I’ve played some of 5 & 6 back when I was 10. About 2005. I didn’t have access to all of the earliest games and haven’t played most of the earlier ones. I’ve played 5-10, 12-14. Sure I haven’t hardcore played every game however I’m far from a newb. I’m just not all in on final fantasy. I like many games and titles.
            It was just a jape
Crisis core was my first final fantasy game

Dissidia was my second. I had no idea who anybody was! 😅
My favorite is x-2. How long before im on a list
I skipped A Realm Reborn.
*Dies by “suicide”*
“I like to hang out in limsa” 

*massacre of server ensues*
Do I get shot for liking the first one and the 16th one?
I only watched walk-throughs of Crisis Core, some OG scenes, Dirge cutscenes, watched AC, and filled in the gaps by reading the wiki. And I proudly claim to be an FF7 fan. 🤷‍♀️ I deserve to be dropped into Mako for being a hypocrite. 

Ofc all kinds of FF fans are valid, but I feel that meme too.
Dirge of Cerberus was the only good one.
Best line in a terrible terrible film.
“I like ff16 but don’t like rebirth.”

Fandom: You are not a ff fan, because ff16 is not final fantasy and rebirth is the best ff ever
"FFX was peak of turn based combat."

Okay you can live, now how bout you?

"FFX2 was the best sto..."
    For a second I thought you were saying FF2 was the best story and was like “yeah, that one’s getting taken out for sure” lol
I hated 10 the combat was stupid.

I mean it actually does, just there are no enemies where that you can justify using the higher ceiling combos on
    No I mean I get yelled at for saying that LOL
Elitist moment

My man.
Same but you're also getting shot
This is exactly the scenario I was thinking of when making this
X is lower tier for me, and I prefer X-2 for that excellent battle system.
Ya 9 sucks bro I’m not waiting 45mins for the battle to load before I can make a decision then wait another 45mins for the computer to register my decision, it’s the only one I haven’t completed because it’s too damn slow
Acceptible. Still hurled an insult at XIII, most of fanbase will forgive you.
    Eh, fair enough. Though I wasn't really throwing shade at XIII, per se. I just *really* hate the Barthandelus fight... 😬
Amen
Final fantasy is what you believe final fantasy is
    kingdom hearts magical puzzle clash is my favorite ff game!
Sounds like you’re a newb fan…  if you were a real fan you’d have a 1-6 game in your list /s
    I’ve played some of 5 & 6 back when I was 10. About 2005. I didn’t have access to all of the earliest games and haven’t played most of the earlier ones. I’ve played 5-10, 12-14. Sure I haven’t hardcore played every game however I’m far from a newb. I’m just not all in on final fantasy. I like many games and titles.
        It was just a jape
For a second I thought you were saying FF2 was the best story and was like “yeah, that one’s getting taken out for sure” lol
Bro don't even like his own game 💀
I don’t care what anyone says, it’s a fun game lol
I would love a remake just in the sort of level of crisis core, maybe fixing some of the janky shooter mechanics. I never got a chance to play it.
    I liked it, the controllers were a bit stiff but overall, I had a good time
Don't feel bad. Those of us who love and devour everything about the FF7 universe had no clue what was going on either.
And the combat, and a development hell, and a Director…
    Idk man if it had a longer story to better flesh it out I don’t think any of those would be such a problem anymore
        The combat would still be a problem tho, as far as I remember before Tabata took over the project, The comment system was going to be similar to kingdom hearts which had me excited, the rebrand happened and Igot less hopeful😅
            Man, the thing about XV’s combat is that the bones of it are so fuckin’ badass both on paper and visually (at least at first). 

Teleporting to a sword after you throw it? Dope.

Awesome synchronized flourish finisher with all the chocobros? Straight fire.

And then the gamey reality of the systems (or lack of) hit you a few hours in.
    The combat in ff16 is bad now?! 
        No, we’re talking about 15
        Odin is so fun to use
            funny* odin is funny to use
                No no. He’s FUN
        Yes. lol it’s so barebones.
I would say acceptable more than solid. In fact I did not feel the game was solid at all. More like a mousse.
I feel like every FF has gotten this from FF6 onwards
    That's interesting to note. If it started with 7 (ive never heard of having people rally against it around its initial PS1 launch) I'd say it's probably around when the heavy marketing of graphics and performance hit mainstream. Sega and Nintendo dabbled in it with their rival marketing for a bit before that, but it absolutely exploded between them after their first generation of rival hardware, and then PlayStation joined in on it and dumped gasoline on the fire. That's when people were firmly forming opinions and started to gather in camps about games. The internet was also on the rise, so more information was also available to help people form opinions on games and genres
    Nah from X onwards. The last time it was turn based
        Nah it's been happening earlier than that. There's always a reason. "not medieval enough", etc.
        Nah the internet was in its early stages but FF6 (or 3 as it was called in the west) vs. FF7 was a real thing. Then shitting on FF8 was a real thing from fans of the previous ones. Then FF9 homaging the older games had the newer fans from 7 and 8 dislike it. 10 is the only entry that was relatively safe from the discourse, but still had its share of haters.

Also I hear that jumping from normal turn-based to atb turn-based was controversial in Japan too so I’m sure the eternal FF fandom war predates this all. Ultimately all the entries switch things up in terms of system and format and genre, irking comfortable type fans unable to adapt to different changes (even though the ever changing nature is the series’ main constant).
        7 absolutely got hate for its strong turn into dieselpunk and sci-fi after 6 flirted with it.

Lot of people felt it wasn't fantasy enough for the franchise.
        There are a few old school FF fans from the SNES era who think the longer cinematics in battle starting 7 ruined the series and the entire genre of JRPGs.
        FF’s first non turn-based (mainline) game was XV. XIII was turn-based, and XI and XIV were turn-based due to that being the MMO standard (it’s just a different idea of turns is all). XII took after XI in some ways and is turn-based, the only difference is that the attack button is automated and you can program your AI to do turns for you. There’s still an ATB bar, if you can’t “press a to swing the sword” then it’s not action-based.

Edited for clarity
Like what Final Fantasy has been doing since X. I know it's a different universe with differing mechanics every time, but combat is even more varied in the games since then.
I'm sure there are people who think every state in America is pretty cool too
This is me, and the OP is how I feel about 9ers
As a FFVIII hater, you’re right. I only hate it because the story is incomprehensible to me and I don’t like the speedrun-designed combat system. But I can admit that it’s just not my thing, it’s so fucking cool to talk about regardless of whether or not I like playing it.

Phoenix accidentally raised him so Odin was sent in for the true final kill.
No I mean I get yelled at for saying that LOL
