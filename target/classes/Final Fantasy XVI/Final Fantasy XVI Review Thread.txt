>A game in a series known for massive changes, easily changes the most, focusing on a tighter story, very specific combat type and arts like DMC, and delivers a beautiful, if truncated world. Well worth getting"

>Final Fantasy XVI is an outstanding achievement. Every part of it, from its characters to its combat, was put there with a purpose. Not only does it deliver satisfyingly slick action RPG combat in between masterfully directed cutscenes, but also a story with real heart. Most importantly, it's incredibly clear that a team of creative individuals was behind every decision. There's a human element that permeates every aspect of Final Fantasy XVI, and it'll end up becoming a lot of people's favorite Final Fantasy because of that.

>In a world full of games trying to stand out, Final Fantasy XVI has no problem rising above the rest. Wonderfully fun combat and beautiful presentation help make the excellent story even more impactful in an adventure well worth the price of admission.

>Final Fantasy XVI melds the best of the series’ themes with a modern, malleable take on combat—creating a heartrending, generation-defining tale of revenge, fate, and freedom.

>Final Fantasy XVI is a weirdo black-sheep entry for the series. It won't be for all nor what all fans necessarily want for the franchise, but I also love it for that boldness. It's a gripping and harrowing page-turner of an epic high-fantasy story with plenty of heart the series is known for. Complex too are the characters, even if not all see their justice by the end. Valisthea is an eerily gorgeous setting, providing some of the most memorable vistas you'll have seen in a Final Fantasy game yet. Accessibility might not be at the forefront of the combat in-game but on offer is some of the most stylistic, and satisfying gameplay we've ever seen in an Action RPG. Even if you take further umbrage with its small flaws, there's no denying that Final Fantasy XVI is a special and memorable event. Through thick and thin, that franchise magic is captured once again. Frankly, you can't ask for anything better than that.

>Final Fantasy XVI proposes a new foundation for finding a masterclass of perfection in action role-playing, and cements a prime legacy founded on past iterations, capitalising on a formula that's seen inarguable successes throughout its years in this medium, and has promulgated an establishment of extravagance that will indeed be hard to surpass.

>With a cast of characters that are easy to invest in, a story that pays off the promise of its impossible scale, and one of the best action combat systems ever committed to disk, Final Fantasy XVI is a game that you owe it to yourself to indulge in.

>In short, Final Fantasy XVI is a breath of fresh air for the Final Fantasy franchise despite its first steps into its grittiest, darkest, and most mature space yet. Its combat showcases action-forward combat held together by a backbone of RPG-similar ability management. Its highs truly showcase phenomenal displays of power in many forms, while its lows effectively strike emotional chords in the hearts of players. This might not be a Final Fantasy fans expect, but boy, it's what Final Fantasy games SHOULD be going forward. FFXVI doesn't have a strongest asset, per se, because its entire presentation is a gripping and fun compilation of the best parts of gaming without the filler and frivolity. PS5 owners, I implore you, don't miss out on what is currently my favorite game of the PS5 generation thus far.

>Final Fantasy XVI delivers on the “action” side of its action-RPG formula. A fierce and fast-paced combat system makes for the series’ most exciting stab at real-time swordplay yet, while its blockbuster Eikon fights rank among some of gaming’s most awe-inspiring battles. But there’s a general flatness surrounding those exhilarating highs, as shallow RPG hooks and dated design leave a promising evolution for the series stuck in the past.

>It’s far too early to determine where Final Fantasy XVI sits in the ranks of Square Enix’s venerable series. However, this is an engrossing, entertaining and, most importantly, fiercely intelligent game. The developers have taken the AAA-blockbuster budget they had to work with, and used it to craft an experience with a strong, provocative and timely message, and then backed it up with some of the most entertaining action combat we’ve ever seen. Not a second of the game’s runtime is wasted, there’s not a single dud character, moment, or scene, and the plot is a riveting epic “page-turner.” If only more blockbuster games were like this, game development would be a far more mature art form.

>Final Fantasy XVI boldly dares to defy series norms and forge a new path forward, resulting in the most satisfying single-player Final Fantasy in nearly two decades.

>Final Fantasy XVI is an excellent continuation point for the Square Enix saga, which, after several missteps, seems to have found the right balance between the tradition of the franchise and a new unabashedly more mature ethic.

>When I look back at my time with Clive, his friends, his enemies, and Valisthea, it’s those highs that I vividly remember. FFXVI is very different from its predecessors, but in many ways, very familiar; And it’s still a Final Fantasy, through and through, reminding me why I love this series so much.

>Stellar and surprisingly customizable combat, a masterfully written and engaging storyline, and a beautiful audio visual presentation. It's nearly a complete package, but with a few annoyances that keep it from being a perfect game. That said, even with those frustrations in mind, Final Fantasy XVI is an absolute return to form for the mainline franchise, and easily a reason to get yourself a PlayStation 5 if you've yet to.

>Final Fantasy 16 largely shines as an epic-length action game, though the places where it attempts to find a comfortable compromise between action game and RPG feel largely unambitious, and certainly fade into the background against aspects that are approached with gusto. But it’s difficult not to get swept up by the earnest saga that Final Fantasy 16 eagerly lays out for you, and the egregious heights of spectacle it displays.

>It's the kind of gamble that Final Fantasy has happily made in the past so that the series may reinvent itself to execute the type of story its creatives want to tell. Time will tell if Final Fantasy 16 pays off, but history certainly supports it.

>Final Fantasy XVI features excellent action combat and an intricate story, both with incredible depth. It combines gameplay, story, sound, and music together into one form all inextricably linked. It sets a new standard for action RPGs, and is quite possibly the pinnacle of the series.

>Final Fantasy XVI is a lot of things. It’s ambitious, gritty, and beautiful, but more importantly, it dares to dream. A sobering tale disguised as a dazzling visual spectacle, the almost-masterpiece presents a nuanced, clever take on all-too-familiar elements, and turns them into fresh experiences that devastate as much as they delight, before delivering the biggest reward – a well-executed emotional payoff.

>Featuring fast, reflex driven, action heavy combat, Final Fantasy 16 is certainly a departure from what fans may expect out of a Final Fantasy game, but its excellent story, characters, and world building are right up there with the best the series has to offer, and the innovative Active Time Lore feature should set a new standard for how lengthy, story-heavy games keep players invested in its world.

>Final Fantasy XVI is a well-crafted experience and a strong Game of the Year contender. Not only does it have a gripping narrative that restored my faith in Square Enix’s ability to tell a gripping story, but it also features several improvements that fans and newcomers alike will enjoy. This isn’t just improved visuals that scream Final Fantasy and a combat system balanced with players of various skill levels in mind. Hardcore players have a robust system to explore that expands on higher difficulties, with less skilled individuals having various paths to experience all that Final Fantasy XVI has to offer.

>Regardless if FFXVI is your first Final Fantasy game or you’re returning to the series, Square Enix’s latest game in the franchise lives up to the hype. Forget about JRPG’s or how action-RPGs nowadays need an open world, side quests that last for ages, co-op or whatever gimmick. FFXVI just throws all that out of the table and proves a tightly woven narrative-driven game –when built right — can make up for all those.
>
>The minor issues the game has doesn’t detract from the incredible experience Clive & Co. bring to the table. Players will be treated to a compelling tale, stunning visual spectacles, and a fluid and fun combat system. What’s even more impressive is, Square Enix manages to make the franchise “grow up” alongside the players who grew up playing the series. FFXVI deals with more mature themes and manages to make it matter without being overly preachy about it.
>
>Those looking for the series’ return to glory, rejoice! Final Fantasy XVI is that game, and this is one fantasy you’ll want to make sure you’re a part of.

>Final Fantasy XVI is an action JRPG polished to an iridescent sheen. Its well-designed combat system and enemies, outstanding character writing and worldbuilding, and consistently stellar side content make it a standout entry in this legendary franchise. Even when accounting for the weak villains and a lukewarm conclusion, this was a journey that truly gripped me from beginning to end. This is a must-play game of the year and a Final Fantasy adventure you won't forget.

>The combat isn’t turn-based, and you don’t control a huge party of characters… Yet, Final Fantasy XVI is still very much a Final Fantasy game through and through. Some fans, both long-time and more recent, will have a hard time accepting the fact, but there’s no denying the work that Yoshi-P and the team have done here. Final Fantasy XVI is a damn masterpiece of epic proportions.
>
>This is the future of Final Fantasy’s artistry – an ever-changing canvas that can be what the team wants it to be and at least, for Final Fantasy XVI, this exercise has proved to be a triumph.

>Inspired by the past but modern at every turn, Final Fantasy XVI is the overhaul the series needed with unparalleled quality.

>Very little gets in the way of the success that Final Fantasy XVI creates. The strength of combat on top of a compelling, deep narrative steal the show.

>I could barely put my controller down during my 57 hours with Final Fantasy XVI. It represents a huge milestone for this franchise, thanks to its bold shift to more adult story-telling (and language), addictive real-time combat, and gargantuan VFX spectacles that are best in class. Marry all that with what the series is already known for — epic orchestral OSTs and phenomenal world-building — and Final Fantasy XVI is nothing short of a must-own.

>Final Fantasy XVI is an epic in every sense of the word. Consistently sharp writing, a captivating cast of characters, exhilarating combat, and a timeless soundtrack coalesce into an experience that showcases what the PlayStation 5 is capable of at the highest level. It constantly finds ways to top its own scale in remarkable fashion, but never loses sight of the intimate journey its built around.

>Final Fantasy XVI’s grander narrative takes wild turns, evokes plenty of heartfelt emotions, and has given me a new cast of characters to fall in love with all over again. It’s a bold direction that Creative Business Unit 3 has taken the franchise, but one well worth the journey.

>At its best, Final Fantasy 16 is a jaw-dropping epic of rarely seen proportions. It's pretty much the pinnacle of cinematic spectacle in modern games, and its often gripping, emotional story is only matched by its fantastic combat system. While its overall quality does dip outside of the main plot, this is still a must-play action RPG, and the best single-player Final Fantasy in over a decade.

>Spectacular, with an epic story and astonishing graphics: and yet, Final Fantasy XVI forgets what is really important for the series. It's impossibile to create a build and there's nothing important left for you to manage through the menus. Proper RPG options are gone, dungeons are just banal corridors, players are forced to play the entire game in easy mode and you can beat the game with literally no effort. There's a decent base for the future, but it's not enough to see a real rebirth for the saga.

>This is one of the most polished AAA releases we have in recent memory. I encountered no major bugs, major performance issues, or even visual pop-ins. Final Fantasy 16 feels like a game that was made the way the creators intended it to be with the utmost care. There are no compromises made here for artificial extensions or hidden profit-making agendas. Final Fantasy 16 is a complete experience from start to finish and it is one that I’d say is worth taking.

>But it’s not that simple. It never is. In FF16, Clive, Cid, and the others ultimately derive their power from the same mysterious origins as the crystals themselves. To complete their objective, they need the very thing they seek to destroy. And so too does FF16 need that history, those traditions, leveraging some even as it drives a dagger through others. That is the duality of the game. A dichotomy at the heart of its structure, its triumphs, and its failures alike. It’s a fascinating piece of work, a wholly imperfect but nevertheless enthralling experience.

>Final Fantasy XVI is by no means a perfect game, but it is an exceptionally good one. The engaging plot, beautiful visuals, and enjoyable gameplay all combine to create something that feels special. It can occasionally be a little long for its own good, and the combat system is slow to get going, but once it hits all the right marks, it knocks them out of the park. I left Final Fantasy XV disappointed by how unfinished it felt, but Final Fantasy XVI is a true rarity these days: a fully finished game that is satisfying from start to finish.

>Final Fantasy XVI is a complete package with a refreshingly mature storyline, full of surprises that keeps raising the stakes. The switch to real-time fights is daring step, but works most of the time, as long as the graphical effects don't blur what's going on. The game can be greatily adapted to facilitate those that mostly play for the story, but also those that are looking for a real challenge. The most epic fights, those between the Eikons, are visually impressive, but a bit too hands-off.

Between Legend of Zelda, Resident Evil, Street Fighter and now Final Fantasy this has really been a great year for classic Japanese franchises .
    Also: A remake of a Super Mario RPG was just announced for this year, we're in another golden age.
        And Super Mario Bros. Wonder!
        Jesus Christ, that is going to be glorious
    And armored core 6 in august. I rented the original when I was super young, got my ass kicked and got lost in the intricacies of the customization. Now as a still shit at games adult I’m excited to give it another go
        I belieber in you
        Honestly, I forsee a lot of controversy surrounding the Armored Core release. With FromSoft's breakout success in the past decade a lot of fans are not familiar with their catalogue of older games. Armored Core is a pretty niche experience that is probably NOT going to be a big hit with most people. I think people buying it because of their love for the Soulsborne games are going to be in for a shock.
            I can definitely see there being people who will ultimately be pissed at what they get. The same thing happened when sekiro released. Idk if there’ll be *a lot* per say. 

At this point I think people that consider themselves part of the soulsborne community are probably so starved for new content that they’ve seen the gameplay vids for any new thing fromsoft puts out and have a baseline understanding for what to expect. 

But I could be way off. I know certain people were upset with elden ring being too different from dark souls and if that can happen, anything can.
    It's not a bad year for all games tbh (Dead Space, Diablo 4, Jedi Survivor, Hogwarts Legacy...) but yeah Japanese devs are on fire for this first half of the year. Ironically, the latter half seems more stacked with Western devs big titles (except Armored Core 6 and probably Pikmin 4, we'll see in a few hours for that one)
        The end of the year is also packed with big releases. It's so much that I can't play all that I want to play.
            This is shaping up to be one of the best years in gaming ever.
                This is why I laugh every time I read people writing how gaming is dead or something. We see some of the best games released every year. This year is no exception.
                    Some people just hyperfixate on the things they hate about gaming. I think it's just because hate is great for algorithmic content filters. So all they see is the worst stuff.

And maybe some of it is just the churn of people burning out. It's a hobby like any other and plenty of people get tired after a while.

Totally agree though, it's so packed that I'm skipping games I want to play because I just don't have the time ;-;
                        > I think it's just because hate is great for algorithmic content filters. So all they see is the worst stuff.

Half that, and half that the human brain is wired in such a way that negative experiences stick around more than positive ones. So its a bad feedback loop between the two all around.
                Absolutely. I thought the golden days of late 90s/2000s were over, but this year might be the best!
                    The difference I think is largely in frequency. This is a great year. But how often we get great years seems spaced further out.
                2017 had Super Mario Odyssey, Zelda Breath of the Wild, Persona 5, Nier:Automata, Horizon Zero Dawn,  Resident Evil 7, Cuphead, Nioh, What Remains of Edith Finch, Wolfenstein II, Undertale, to name a few.
                    undertale was 2015
                    Let's not forget Prey!
                    Undertale is older than that no? Great year though. I still need to go back and beat Nier
                    This year is already beating 2017 for me personally
                    How about 2020? New Horizons, Doom Eternal, Hades, Persona 5 Royal, FF7 Remake, TLOU2, Half-Life Alyx, Demon's Souls, Spider-Man Miles Morales, Microsoft Flight Simulator, Yakuza Like a Dragon, Ori and the Will of the Wisps, 13 Sentinels, Ghost of Tsushima, Genshin Impact, Cyberpunk (okay, it's debatable, but it has its fans), and more.
                I think we can safely say that it is. The best year for gaming since probably 2007 or 2008.
                    2011 was good, no? (Skyrim, Arkham City, MW3, Dark Souls, Battlefield 3, Portal 2, Uncharted 3)
                        2017 as well
                            Yeah, 2017 was just an insane year.

                                [deleted]
                            Horizon: Zero Dawn, Nier: Automata and Persona 5 all within a few months of each other (in the west at least). 2017 was great
                                So was Breath of the Wild. Horizon has consistently come out at bad times. First game was a week before BotW. Second game came out a week before Elden Ring.
                                    How could I miss BotW. Spring 2017 was on fire.
                        Kinda stops there though. The reason why this year is the best in awhile is because the games are good, they're mostly all beloved franchises, and there's just sooooooo many. The list of released games this year is enough to stand against 2007 for me, and we're only halfway through the year
                            Off the top of my head, 2007 had Halo 3, CoD 4, Mass Effect, Assassin's Creed, Rock Band, GH3, Bioshock, AND Orange Box. I'm sure there are more that I missed, but to me, it's still the GOAT year
                                [deleted]
                                    Supreme Commander released in 2007 as well, incredible RTS
                                Burning Crusade, Crysis, Uncharted, STALKER, God of War 2, Metroid Prime 3, Super Mario Galaxy.

What a fantastic year. I started out with Burning Crusade in January, picked up Bioshock and Orange Box in the middle, and ended with Halo 3, Mass Effect, and CoD 4. That's my personal favorite year for sure.
                        Yeah, that was a great year too. But a lot of huge IPs started in 2007.
                        Forgot Deus Ex: Human Revolution, The Witcher 2 and LA Noire.

2010 was almost as good IMO: Mass Effect 2, Fallout New Vegas, Bad Company 2, AC: Brotherhood, Starcraft 2, BLOPS 1, NFS Hot Pursuit, Alan Wake. Was an absolutely insane two-year period
                    It’s hard to picture a year more stacked than 2007, but this year definitely feels close.
                        1998 is pretty famous. You had Ocarina of Time, F-Zero X, Metal Gear Solid, Resident Evil 2, Sonic Adventure, Banjo-Kazooie, Spyro the Dragon, StarCraft, Pokemon Red and Blue (in North America), Half-Life, Grim Fandango, Thief, Baldur's Gate.

That year was insane.
                            it was doubly insane considering a lot of us were little kids for it.  I still miss when I could imagine wide worlds while playing things like Tomb Raider 2.  As an adult, I know there's "nothing there" but as a kid, you didn't know games had limitations, especially before the internet.

I miss impossible rumors like "every person you fight is an actual person somewhere playing too!" or "if you collect all 35 1/35 soldier, they come alive and kill Sephiroth before he stabs Aerith!"
                            Okay no, it’s definitely 1998 if that’s the case. That’s damn near unbeatable.
                                It actually gets better...  


OP missed:   
Mario Party, Rainbow Six, Xenogears, and Rogue Squadron among others.
                                1997 was better for me.

Diablo, Final Fantasy 7, Castlevania SOTN, Blood, MDK, Harvest Moon, Final Fantasy Tactics, Star Fox 64, GoldenEye 007, Oddworld, Fallout, Jedi Knight: Dark Forces 2, Age of Empires, Blade Runner, Quake 2 and Gran Tourismo.
                                    1994 gets no love, but was pretty amazing as well.

Sonic the Hedgehog 3, X-COM: UFO Defense, Super Metroid, The Elder Scrolls: Arena, Final Fantasy VI, Magic Carpet, TIE Fighter, Earthworm Jim, The King of Fighters '94, EarthBound, The Need for Speed, Master of Magic, Mortal Kombat II, System Shock, Doom II, Sonic & Knuckles, Killer Instinct, Warcraft: Orcs & Humans, Donkey Kong Country, King's Quest VII: The Princeless Bride, Wing Commander III: Heart of the Tiger, Tekken, King's Field, Marathon, Heretic
                2017 had Super Mario Odyssey, Zelda Breath of the Wild, Persona 5, Nier:Automata, Horizon Zero Dawn,  Resident Evil 7, Cuphead, Nioh, What Remains of Edith Finch, Wolfenstein II, Undertale, to name a few.
            I managed more or less on the big releases (but I'm not interested in all of them to be fair), except TOTK reported to whenever I have the time. But I certainly not progressing on my backlog (in fact I'm adding to it lol)
            im still on PS4 and for the past few years ive felt perfectly comfortable with that and like i didnt need to upgrade anytime soon. within the past half year that’s completely been demolished and my backlog has absolutely ballooned up lol. its to the point where the longer i wait the bigger an investment the ps5 becomes because id want to buy like at least 5 $70 games right away
        Is Jedi Survivor fixed on PC yet though? Last time I tried it it was still incredibly broken. I really want to play it but also don't want to support games being released in that state.
            Nope, it ain't. Still broken and crashing on specific planets. Latest patch (like 2 days ago) had no mention of significant performance or stability improvements afaik
            I'd still wait to play it, if I were you. I've played it on PC and beat it, and while it's undoubtedly a fantastic game, the experience was definitely tarnished by the sluggish frame rate and stuttering in cut scenes.
        I don't think "not a bad year" describes a year with ToTK, ff16, Diablo 4, good remakes of 2 of the best horror games of all time, releases from all 3 big fighting franchises, and later this year spiderman 2, starfield, and armored core 6.
            Yeah it was an understatement. Also a new Mario 2D just announced, Pikmin 4, Baldur's Gate 3, AC Mirage, Alan Wake 2, Avatar Frontiers of Pandora, Cyberpunk 2077 revamp and expansion,...

I think like the devs have just collectively decided to all come in 2023. And weirdly we know almost nothing coming post-2023 except a few games lol.
    In general, it's been a strong year for games.
        I don't think we've seen such a strong year for video games in a long time. This is definetly in the top 5 of video game years in terms of quality output.

If Elden Ring launched this year, it'd basically be unbeatable :O
            Zelda, Resident Evil 4, Jedi Survivor, Diablo 4, Starfield, Spider-Man 2, FF16, Mario RPG, Mario Wonder, Yakuza Gaiden, Honkai Star Rail, Dead Space, Alan Wake 2, Gollum.

What a year.
                You snuck that one in there didn't you
                    Yeah Zelda barely squeezed in.
                You forgot Hogwarts Legacy and Baldurs Gate 3. Absolutely nutty year.
                    I really enjoyed dead island 2. The video game equivalent of a really well executed B movie with great gore and visuals
            [removed]
    Capgod renaissance
        They only need to drop a Monster Hunter World 2 trailer to achieve absolute and total dominance this year.
            Sunbreak is done with it's TU cycle...announcement probably isn't THAT far off now
                Tokyo Game Show in September! That's where Rise was revealed.
                It's almost guaranteed to be revealed at TGS, they straight up said to monster hunter fans "to look forward to TGS 2023"
                I suspect it might still be a while since it might seem too similar to Dragon’s Dogma 2. I was hopeful too but I think world 2 gets announced closer to DD2 release
        From Crapcom to Capgod in the span of a decade, what a ride
    At first I thought Horizon (2022 ooops) would have been a great GOTY contender, then Tears of The Kingdom dropped and thought that was a shoe in for GOTY. Started playing SF6 and was having some of those "good ol days" moments not sure if a fighting game could win GOTY though. I'm enjoying my time with D4 and its a solid entry as well. The FFXVI absolutely blew me away, so I really have no idea what game is going to win this year.

Its been a great first half and we still got Baldurs Gate 3, Armored Core 6, Alan Wake 2, Spider-Man 2, MK1, Witchfire(EA?), Starfield, Remnants 2, Pikmin 4, Like a Dragon, Pay Day 3, Avatar, and Lies of P to look forward to.
        Yeah, this is gonna be one of those 'Was this one of the best years in gaming' years, I think, in discussions of the future.  I really didn't think things were going to keep getting -better- after Horizon.
            Wasn’t Horizon last year? Or are you talking about the Burning Shores DLC?
                To be fair, Burning Shores is a damned good DLC.
        >At first I thought Horizon would have been a great GOTY contender

Call of the Mountain? Because Forbidden West will be close to two years old by GOTY time.
            Man you're right. I only played it this year before Jedi Survivor* (My timeline is jacked up this morning) so thats why it was still fresh to me. lol.
    they just announced super mario RPG is getting remade and out in november. so this is officially the best year in gaming of all time for me lol
    Hi-Fi rush as well ;)
    Japanese devs have been delivering hit after hit for the last years. Not only they're pretty commercially successful, but I feel they're the only ones making interesting AAAs. 

From Software and Nintendo have revolutionized the open world genre with Zelda and Elden Ring. And even old sagas are receiving more attention in the west, like the Yakuza series. Persona has made turn based rpgs cool again, FF is looking great. 

There was a time when people wondered if Japanese gaming was in a crisis, and now they're artistically on top while having strong sales.
        They're definitely not the only ones making interesting AAA games. They're good. But there's nothing \*interesting\* about RE4 REmake, for instance. It's just really damned good. There's nothing \*interesting\* about Street Fighter VI, it's just really damned good. I'll definitely give you Persona but that series has been oozing with style since 3. People are just finally catching on after 5. 

&#x200B;

I don't really like this narrative that "western devs" are creatively bankrupt when all the incentives structures to turn a profit on a game still exist in Japan. Japan has a diverse set of developers creating great games and so does "the west".
I went from having passive interest in this game to counting down the seconds to Thursday once I played that demo. Just a genius idea to put the first few chapters out for free.
    It's also genuinely is a great opening on its own in terms of narrative, akin to a larger act instead of a chapter of a story, in how it condenses the first couple of hours with having an established opening with introducing the characters, a middle-portion that explores the relationships of the characters, and a cathartic finale that ends on a suspenseful note. If the rest of the game has this kind of roller-coaster feel, then this is going to be an absolute big treat.
        I also liked reading all the backstory during cutscenes.
            One of the standout features for me so far and I hope other games start to implement it.
                It's great for people who might need to take a break from playing and come back in a couple weeks and not remember everything in the story. And it cuts down on boring exposition for everyone.
                    It’s also great for folks like me that generally steer clear of high fantasy because of all the made up regions, names, supernatural elements, etc. sounding similar and being confusing. Such a great feature
        Its basically the pilot episode to the game
        For real. The fact that the context of the opening fight goes from "holy shit this is fucking awesome" to "holy shit nonono please make it stop" over the course of two hours is a serious testament to the narrative heft this game carries.
    Sometimes you get demos that make you want to play a game like FF16, SF6, RE4, and sometimes you get demos that make you want to avoid them like Balan Wonderworld and Forspoken.
        I think it’s pretty wild that Square is publishing things with such discrepancies in quality. Talk about diversification.
            I'd say a large part of the quality of FF16 (and 14!)  is down to Yoshi-P and his team. The man knows exactly what direction he wants to take his games in down to the smallest detail and his team is phenomenal at executing that.

It also helps that he is high enough in the company where he can mostly tell other suits to screw off when they try to cram in NFT's or other similar garbage.
            That's just how publishers used to be, the difference is that now big publishers don't make games anymore.
    It's so funny that big video game developers are rediscovering the concept of playable demos.

"Play the first chapter for free, pay for the rest" used to be *the* shareware concept.
        I get *why* publishers can be wary of demos because the last thing they want is something like the Forespoken demo to convince everyone not to get a game, but I can really pay dividends if the game is good. Like this, I've never had much interest in FF, but this one has been piquing my interest since it was revealed, and the demo totally sold me. 

Or another example, I played the shit out of the Mortal Kombat 9 demo after never playing a console fighter other than Smash, and now I'm a few months away from buying my 6th Netherrealm Studios game in MK1, all thanks to that demo.
            Demos work is you have confidence in the game.

I've been playing a number of impressive ones in Steam Next Fest (Little Kitty Big City is basically Stray but with more stuff to knock off ledges and humans to mess with) that I don't think would get any attention without the demo.

If your game is mediocre it can backfire, but if you have real confidence in the product it's a great way to build hype.
        Square Enix has always done demos for final fantasy though. I can’t think of one that didn’t. Even FF14 has a free trial that’s easily 60+ hours.
            It goes beyond Final Fantasy to Square Enix in general.

A lot of their games have had demos for years. All 3 Bravely Defaults, Forspoken, Triangle Strategy, both Octopaths, Dragon Quest 11, the new Valkyrie Profile, etc. Their collaborations with other studios (like Platinum for Nier Automata and Team Ninja for Strangers of Paradise) have also had demos.

DQ11’s demo in particular is one of the most generous demos I’ve ever seen. You get like the first 8 hours of the game.

At this point, it’s more surprising if a SE game *doesn’t* have a demo.
                By the time I hit the DQ11 demo stopping point I felt obligated to buy it cause I had so much time put in already lol
                    It's funny since I had the exact opposite reaction. There was a time when I'd be all over that JRPG comfort food but playing the demo made me realise I've probably done it too many times, and I've moved on so it didn't make me want more (I stopped before the end). But I think overall it could only have helped them find more sales so it was still a good idea to release it.
                I wasn’t 100% confident as I could only definitely remember every FF game but you’re absolutely right. Square Enix has always had this practice.
    Same here. I figured I’d try the demo and just wait for the game to come to PC, but after playing it I don’t want to wait anymore. My wife stopped playing her game to watch the demo and then had to stop watching at the end because of how emotional it made her.

We’re in for one hell of a ride.
        man, the end of the demo really made me feel uncomfortable, just brutal.

    Right there with you. I've had Horizon Forbidden West ready to go for so long but just can't bring myself to start it. I made the mistake of playing a bunch of Assassin's creed games near the end of last year and I've been burnt ever since.

Everything I've touched since has been story driven or souls-like. Can't be more hyped for this FFXVI play-through. Nice to see a game just work it's strengths instead of shoving in shallow RPG systems to micro-manage or patterned open world gameplay loops.
        [deleted]
    >But dude, I am open world burnt out. I could go for a linear experience at this point.

No joke I started Horizon FW and just put it down after the prologue. I was so burned by Elden ring at that point...
    It is extremely frustrating to me that comments like yours are such a common reply to criticisms about linearity. It's like nowadays gamers think there's only open world games on the one hand and completely linear games on the other.

You guys do know tons of non-open world games are not linear, right? There is a middle ground between open world and hallway level design.

Games like Dark Souls, Resident Evil, the recent God of War games, or the Metroidvania genre in general have interesting levels that offer satisfying exploration, without being open world.

Hallway levels are just awful, there is no excuse to ever have that in any AAA action RPG.

After about 8 hours of gameplay I can confirm most of what FF16 has is short, empty hallways. This is some of the worst "level design" (if you can even call it that) that I have ever experienced.

You might as well not let the player walk around and just have us go from cutscene to battle back to cutscene because there is really no point in being given control over your character when all you do is hold up for 15 seconds between battles.

There is absolutely zero exploration, let alone meaningful exploration to be found here.

I'm not asking for an open world, but just give me something that might actually make me think Square Enix employs a level designer. The maps don't need to be big open massive spaces, just give us a tightly designed dungeon crawling experience with branching paths, shortcuts, looping level design, etc...

I'm not asking for Dark Souls levels either, just give me *something*.
    Really hard to tell before playing it. Lots of "corridor" games are cool because they dress it up enough it doesn't feel as constrained as it actually is (FFX for me). Plenty don't go through the motions and it suffers for it (FF13, barring one notable exception).

It sounds like it leans more towards the former though, thank goodness.
    It really depends how linear it is. I loved the linear nature of FF10 and it is still my favorite FF. The way they did the linearity is a big part why. But if they are paths only from A to B (like the demo) with not exciting loot to incite exploring than it will feel bad.

I'm already salty for FF to follow the path of Action RPGs and throwing away the turn based combat. If they now decide to also delete the RPG from it then i'm done with the series.
    Agreed. I love open world games but they can be exhausting. And sometimes I'm not up to start one cause everything is so vast.
GOTY is gonna be stacked this year.  Instantly purchased this after completing the demo.  Can’t wait to play it.
    There are games that could have won on some slower years, that won’t even get nominated this year. Pretty crazy honestly.
        Dragon Age Inquisition and Shadow of Mordor fought for most GOTY picks in 2014. I don't know if a game equivalent in quality this year makes the top 10 of *already released* games, without even thinking about what's to come in the second half of the year.
            We're really coming out of the Covid Lull when it comes to gaming.  It takes two won GotY in 2021, could you imagine that happening today?
                Honestly still surprised It Takes Two won over: 

* Deathloop
* Metroid Dread
* Psychonauts 2
* PS5 Ratchet & Clank
* Resident Evil 8
* Returnal

ITT wasn't even the best reviewed game of that year and yet somehow won GotY.
                    Reviewers liked it but the player base LOVED it. It probably deserved to win
                    Returnal should have won imo.
                    Other than Metroid Dread, I think the rest were like 8/10 games... I think that was a pretty weak year tbh
            I think Dragon age Inquisition is really fantastic and definitely one of the biggest RPG of the last decade, i would absolutely put in very high among the best games of the year even if it relesed today.
            Those two games fighting for GOTY in 2014 indicates just how pathetically weak 2014 was.
                2014 had Bayonetta 2, Mario Kart 8, Shovel Knight, Divinity Original Sin, Dark Souls 2, Smash 3DS/Wii U, and Alien Isolation too

It wasn’t a great year in the grand scheme of things, but there were games to be played for sure
                Inquisition was great though. It's by far the most lore dense entry in the series. 

There were certainly some missteps (timed war table, the first area being garbage) but it was a great game as long as you weren't expecting Origins 2.
                    I found Inquisition painfully mediocre in every way. Everything it did, Witcher 3 did a million times better a year later.
        That’s Hi-Fi Rush for me. I thought it could at least get nominated for a GOTY award but there’s like no chance now. Still really happy with the game though.
            Hi-Fi Rush is *brilliant*, and it would absolutely be a top contender in a year that wasn't as wildly packed as this one.
            I mean, it seems like the Game Awards usually have at least one indie game nominated for GOTY each year, so I’m still hoping for Hi-Fi Rush to be there. I just want to hear the orchestra play one of its songs during the medley they always do, lol.
                Hi-Fi is not an indie, it was developed by Tango Gameworks who are a Zenimax studio.

Definitely a smaller budget title (that is incredible) but they are not an indie studio.

But yeh with you, would love to hear a medley of songs from Hi-Fi, that would be fucking awesome lmao
        for sure. most years only have like 3 real contenders. all of 2021 wouldnt even be in consideration this year
    We should switch to Game of the Month for 2023
        And for this past June we should probably switch to Game of the Week...
        Even that would be pretty hotly contested each month, lol.
    2023 seems to be best year for gaming since 2017 which was the best year for gaming since 2011. 

Maybe the secret to a great year for gaming is the release of a new 3D Zelda.
        Imagine if Elden Ring came out a year later than it's release date amongst all this.
        We just need the new 3d Mario game to drop during holidays and it’ll basically be 2017 part 2
            Well, not 3D, but still a great looking Mario game is coming out later on this year.
                Super Mario Bros. Wonder **AND** the most unexpected thing, a 3D Remake of Super Mario RPG.  My jaw dropped.
                I just saw those, 2023 is a certified classic
    Really feels like all the COVID impacted titles are finally spilling over the dam all at once.
    And we don't even have Spiderman, Mario, Alan Wake, Starfield etc... yet. What a bonkers year for games!
    I can't remember a year that stacked since a long time (2020 was pretty good but like all the year is equivalent to 6 months of 2023). And it's only half of it with tons of great hits to come (presumably).

2023 will reach 2007 levels probably (though while 2007 gave birth to many iconic franchises of gaming like Mass Effect, Uncharted, Bioshock..., this is mostly returning franchises now)
        I legitimately cannot remember the last time there were so many huge games in a single year, but so many of these have come out just *2 months* from one another.  In terms of critically acclaimed releases in a single year, I think 2023 may be the biggest year in gaming.  And we are only half way done with it.
            The late August/September timeframe is just crazy. Less than a month and Armored Core 6, Baldur's Gate 3, Mortal Kombat 1, Starfield and Phantom Liberty (which might as well be a full new game considering the extent of the changes it seems) are dropping. And that's just big games, there are also indies and smaller ones I probably forgot.
            Guys, just look at 2017, it's not so long ago.
    Armored Core coming in hot in 2 months as well.
If anyone has any questions, I've had the game since Friday last week and I'm about 40% through I believe. Just a few points I want to confirm.

-	Performance is hit and miss. According to my monitor, it rarely hits 60 stable and falls between the VRR threshold of 48Hz often. I don’t envy people playing this on non-VRR displays. HOWEVER because I got it early I do not have that 300mb patch the devs confirmed a few days ago
-	The sidequests are quite good, and tell a lot of the lore of the world, take time to get to those good ones though
-	Combat is as addicting as can be, and definitely takes it to another level vs the demo
-	The EIKON fights are as beautiful as you can imagine, and the first couple are quite good. BUT if you felt that the one in the demo is long....yeah they don’t get much shorter lol. And for some people (not me personally) they will probably get stale. It is essentially QTE railed ecstasy combat, for better or worse
-	The RPG ‘loot’ is not good. You auto pickup and I really didnt have any incentive to explore the already linear overworlds. Pretty much an afterthought from the devs it looks like
-	You really can't accessorize Clive in any way, expect it like FFVII (Cloud is the same looking the entire game)
    Really surprised to hear this (3rd comment I've seen about it and reviews lauding them) about side quests.

I read earlier before the embargo there were like 80 something so I prepared for them to be shallow and cookie cutter since there were so many.

Really happy that doesn't appear to be the case
        Now, without spoiling anything, the first 10 you do are pretty bad and generic, but it does get better when you advance in the story. I've done roughly 30-35? and I'd say 20 of them are what I consider good.
            Honestly a few mediocre side quests is what I expect even in games with the best side quests (even Witcher 3 had its share weak ones). As long as the ratio isn’t too stilted towards the mediocre then the high points of the good quests will outweigh any negatives.
                Yeah, and honestly a few beans quests are actually good for the game in the long run I think. Makes the really good one stand out over the 'meh' ones.
    Can I ask you a weird one? How easy is it to tell what the hell is going on in combat? I’ve noticed that with this style of game, where everything is over the top flashy, it can be very hard to read what’s going on vs your Souls games, or Horizon or something. And in a game that wants you dodge and parry with precision, that’s a problem. 

Also, when you say “combos”, are you talking about memorizing 8-button (or more) strings that have to be pressed rhythmically? I’ve never been good at those? 

Thanks.
    Disappointing about the Eikon fights. I was hoping that player agency wasn't going to be paper thin, but here we are. I guess how else would you do it right?
        Definitely spectacle over renowned combat. You're essentially Godzilla fighting things larger or as big as you. If that sounds fun to you you'll definitely enjoy it. The ones I've done are all different in their own ways so please don't mistake my description, but its 100% for the awe and not the engaging combat some might expect.
    > and I'm about 40% through I believe

How many hours of gametime to reach 40%?
        I’m about 20 hours in!
    My main concern is that enemies could feel quite spongy. And they often seem to have super armour outside the stagger mechanic . 

Does this get better over time? Or can fights drag on a bit?
        So I've personally found all enemies pair with your level, so if you felt that way with the demo enemy fodder (we're talking seperate from the mini boss battles like the dragoon) then I can say they will feel a bit spongy. 

I think thats why the combat is how it is. It forces you to combo and not just mash the attack button. If I just do that they do feel spongy, if I get huge combos by using eikon attacks + jumping and swerving that spongyness is still there but is drastically reduced. Does that make sense?
            I guess my worry was if they don’t flinch much. Do you get time to pull off combos?
                Very much. Obviously theres stagger, but if you pull big combos even when they're not staggered, they can't really do anything until you're done them lol. Very empowering if you can master them.

        Im pretty avid in action RPGs, so I do believe if you're like me you would find this easy. For reference I've yet to die. + I do not use the necklaces that provide some handicaps for gameplay. 

I was debating just trying to get the New Game+ as fast as possible so I can be challenged, but decided not too and I'm just enjoying the ride. I hear that that mode is the challenge mode.

I'd say its in the middle of Final Fantasy VII Remake normal mode and hard mode.
    What are the towns/cities like?
        Lively in terms of how many NPCs are around (much more than VII Remake Sector's) but don't expect Novigrad. If you played Horizon Zero Dawn, its like Meridian. Lots of talking (not to you) but going about their business.

I've been to two major cities. The towns are much smaller but still populated.
I just finished Tears of the Kingdom and am so stoked for Final Fantasy XVI. It's crazy immediately jumping from one Game of the Year contender to another.
    Right?! 2023 is going down in history
        Reddit hates it, but shit, diablo released between the two and the reviews were great too.
            Which is funny because I think Diablo is probably the best Western (as in not Japanese) game so far this year with Jedi close second.
    Once done with that. End august you can play baldurs gate 3, another huge game which will end up being the actual best game of the year obviously.
They both liked the game but it nearly sounds like ACG and Easy Allies didn't play the same game.

ACG: "It's the story of a single person, Clive."

Easy Allies: "The story is great and fleshes out all the characters!"

ACG: "The side quests are boring and not worth discussing"

Easy Allies: "The side quests are great and really add a lot to the backgrounds of the different characters!"
    From a French youtuber i follow, he said that the side quest were mostly MMO-tier very barebones ones but some of them stands out by , i quote" trying very hard to be like The Witcher 3". So apparently there is some really good quests inside a lot of forgettable ones.
    I heard the side quest only get interesting halfway through, that was from ign review so perhaps there is truth from both reviewers?
    You can still have a story that fleshes out multiple characters but ultimately it can still be the story of one person and his journey.
    The sidequests can be both at once. Mechanically a bit eh but with good dialog and story. 

The first few I did were just fetch quests. However, they did a lot to flesh out how the people felt about being where they were.
The big drawback that I am seeing in these reviews is that the game has shaved off much of the franchise’s deeper RPG systems, and the RPG aspect of this game is pretty shallow compared to previous titles. The levels are more linear as well.

Game is not locked at 60FPS, buts it’s targeting 60FPS, so there is some performance stuttering.

But the story, the characters (especially Clive Rosfield), the visuals, the soundtrack, the side quests and most importantly the gameplay are all being acclaimed, and compensates for the game’s linearity and RPG mechanics. 

This is a surefire GOTY contender.
    It seems they have traded that for mechanical complexity in the combat. It's not quite DMC or Bayoneta level of course, but compared to your average Character Action game it seems to have more going on for combo building.
        The combat was actually designed by the dude who did DMC 5 combat
            *One* of the guys who did DMC 5. Ryota Suzuki also worked on Dragon’s Dogma and Marvel Vs Capcom 2.
    Are the levels truly more linear, or do they just not put as much effort into making it feel non-linear? Because most FF games are actually pretty on-rails for the majority of the game, even if you feel like you can explore a world map.

FF7 was completely linear until you found Cid's plane for example.
        That's true, but it did give players some different options/experiences by the time you get Cid's plane, even if relatively minor.

Wall Market, how you played through Shinra Tower, the Phoenix thing, exploring the Golden Saucer, and getting Yuffie and/or Vincent all had the potential to give players different experiences by the time you get the plane and the map opens up a bit.
            I played FF7 my whole childhood and atleast for young me I felt completely free and even lost at so many times. At 8 years old I didn't have the gamesense to see where they were trying to lead me I suppose. All in all it took me 5-6 years to beat it (6/7yo to 12yo)
        FF7 gave you the illusion of freedom while heavily guiding you around especially with the mode of transportation. Still, you could always do extra stuff or skip it - so more like a Metroidvania nowadays. For a 90's game, it was pretty open.
        FF16's levels, at least in the first 8 hours, are literal hallways.

It's not about story progression being linear. That's fine. It's that the spaces you ""explore"" are literal straight lines 95% of the time.

Short, straight, empty hallways. You hold up for 15 seconds, then you get a battle, then up for 15 seconds, then a cutscene, then a battle, then up for 15 seconds, rinse and repeat ad nauseam. 

What little loot there is is basically just potions and crafting materials, and Clive automatically hoovers them up just by walking within 10 feet of them.

Oh, and they even give you a dog who will "show you the way", you know, in case you get lost in the tiny hallway that literally only gives you one way to go.

It's just unbearably hand-holdy and braindead. You might as well not give the player control to walk around if that's how it's going to be. Just have us go from cutscene to battle to cutscene to battle, cause that's all it is anyway. No need to let us explore when there's nothing to explore. It's pointless. 

And there is simply no comparison with the older games. Sure you had linear story progression for the most part, but the spaces you explored were not straight lines.

I replayed FF9 just a couple years ago, and that game has actual level design. It's not gonna blow your mind like a Dark Souls level, but the spaces you explore are not hallways. 

FF16 right now is almost making me think CBU3 do not employ any level designers.
    > The big drawback that I am seeing in these reviews is that the game has shaved off much of the franchise’s deeper RPG systems, and the RPG aspect of this game is pretty shallow compared to previous titles

I like Final Fantasy but I think that it have never really had that deep RPG systems compared to many other in the genre, both compared to the west and Japan.
        They have, the games are just usually just really easy so the complexity is in how broken you can get it to be (Except for like the one or two optional super hard bosses every game).

Same as pokemon, it can be pretty interesting mechanically but main story is brain dead easy.
    Ehhh Final Fantasy was never that deep to begin with tbh. 

Like , unless i missing something most games you can just Power level anything. 

The most ''in-depth'' FF that i tried out was 12 Zodiac Edition with the job system and gambits.
        I don't know if "depth" would be the right descriptor, but FF7's materia system could lead to some pretty wacky character builds, along with FF8's junction system.
            Which is a bit of a double edged sword.  One weakness of FFVII is all the characters feel very samey because of the materia system.  That's fixed in FFVII Remake though
            the depth of the combat system will probably not be fully explored by most critics
                Probably because the game also doesn't demand that from the player.
                    I just beat FF8 again last year. I kid you not I didn't use an ability outside of attack or limit break for the first 30 hours.
                        Yeah FF8 has the air of complexity but it's incredibly basic and none of it is at all necessary to complete the game.
                            FF8 is legit my all time favourite game, but once you figure out how to cure-refine tents into curaga on disc 1 it is over.
                                Nah, getting Curagas from tents is nice, but the thing that breaks the game is realizing that Abyss Worm cards refine into Windmills which refine into Tornadoes.  Those will give you OP strength until the mid-game and by the mid-game you can easily get more upgrades.

Not to mention Disc 1 Lionheart, and general limit break spam.
                        Yea, you just spam Aura on Squall and Renzokuken your way from disk 1 to the end of disk 4.
                            Haha yeah aura is that one non-limit break ability you cast...because it lets you cast more limits. Occasionally haste too. Ya know. More limits faster. Love the game but it feels like they literally never even gave it a single balancing pass.
            Those (and I'd add FFX and the MMOs to that list) are more the exception, honestly... It's really what makes "JRPG" different than "RPG".

Look at FFIX, for example. A wonderful, virtually perfect game, but it has very little in the way of RPG systems. In a lot of numbered FFs, pretty much the only choices that change anything are which party members you choose to bring along. (By the way, the right answer is Quina.)
            While I agree with them that FF series and JRPG's in general never really have what I would call depth in terms of the RPG systems, I replayed FF7 about a year or two ago and there's a certain satisfaction that comes from how absolutely broken you can make Tifa by putting her in the backline with Long Range materia and always making sure she has Sadness, then mixing in counter/cover/X4 attack with Powersoul and Curse Ring and giving her Odin linked with Added Effect. I can't remember my exact materia/gear setup but by the end of the game she was just demolishing everything in a turn or two.
        7's materia system and even 8's junk system had some depth I'd say. Especially 7 had some absolute ridiculous combinations if you could figure (and, well, grind) them out.
            I'm a huge FF7 fan, but that game is pretty easy. It was basically the JRPG tutorial (along with Pokémon Red and Blue) for a lot of us. Materia combos can be absurd, though.
                I don't know how adult me would feel about them, but back in the day I wouldn't say the optional bosses were that easy. Of course if you look up online where to find the best weapons, limit breaks and materia you can make them fairly trivial, but I'm talking about just playing the game blind.
                    That's for sure. You can cheese basically any encounter if you look it up. I do recall child me struggling with the weapons.
                    The optional bosses were the only parts that had any incentive on actually using the systems, but they were also designed around selling you the Ultimania guides, that was SquareSoft's MTX back in the day, so they were basically never fair but hard, just hard with almost no way of truly figuring them out without the guide
                        Fighting Emerald with no knowledge of materia for Underwater breathing.
        You could literally change most characters and the job system is a hallmark of the series
    I mean it's not like JRPGs are always particularly deep mechanics wise and neither has FF as a franchise been. The series only got mechanically more "complicated" with the job system in FF3 where something other than just "equip best gear and accessories"  got introduced. FF6 has the magicite which boggled down to "equip on everyone until they get their magic and then swap around". FF7 and FF8 went a bit more complicated as the materia system essentially allowed everyone to do everything, the GF system was similar to magicite in 8 but you couldn't permanently keep the abilities. FF9 was pretty much just "make sure everyone learns all abilities from the items" and only FF10 went far enough where you could actually cripple your characters with the advanced sphere grid. Outside of that it's generally been nothing more than "equip your best items and a ribbon if you got one".
        The job system got much better from FF1->FF3->FF5->Bravely Default, so that was progress there. Being able to combine parts of different jobs in FF5 and even moreso in BD added a lot of depth imo.
        I agree. Chrono Trigger is loved by many JRPG fans and its a very short and mechanically shallow game.
            It was 1995 on SNES, at the time the game was fairly robust in mechanics for a console game. Characters with abilities that interacted with each other was pretty exciting back then. Plus the several minigames (millennial fair, bike chase, etc) and for RPGs it set a standard for sure.

Now, yeah, it's extremely basic but it does the things it does very well. Which is hard for most new JRPGs to achieve.
                Oh I agree. I’m just saying JRPGs dont need crazy mechanical depth to be enjoyable. I like CT as much now as I did then. The game is just a vehicle for the story
    FF15's RPG aspects were pretty shallow as well. It's unfortunate but they just seem to view the series as an action series now. From what I've seen (and played) the rest of the game more than makes up for it.

That said love to see the mainline series try turn based again (or atb) with games like Persona and Dragon Quest's mainstream western popularity proving there's still a market for that.
        To be honest, I have never considered FF's RPG aspects to be that deep at all.

For most games, you equip a weapon, you have a skill book and you equip an armor piece, an amulet or a trinket, a ring and that's it.
        They're "overhauling" Dragon Quest's combat system for the next mainline entry. It might end up not being a turn-based game either.
        FF15 was a unfinished game with a seemingly unfocused idea of what they wanted their action combat to be. FF7 remake improved on that, and it seems FF16 improved and mayhaps perfect it.
            FF7 remake was weirdly not much of an action game. Or it was one with a lot of menu usage. It was weird. But it's probably as close to another ATB game as we'll get
    > The levels are more linear as well.

This has raised my interest in the game. I'm so burnt out from open worlds.
    >the game has shaved off much of the franchise’s deeper RPG systems

To be fair, most of these were shaved off in FF13 and 15. Based on what I played of the demo, this game seems to be re-adding some complexity. Certainly an abundance of potential complexity with the combat.
    Yeah the gameplay sounds amazing in combat,  but exploration seems to not really be as rewarding as past games. The demo performance didn’t really bother me, so I’m not worried about that and will probably play in quality mode regardless. Side quests sounded like more of a mixed bag to me though, and this description makes it sound pretty similar to FF7Rs which aren’t my favorite.

> Sidequests especially strike out on that front, delivering dull content that seems uncharacteristically weak for a team that’s responsible for the beloved Final Fantasy XIV. The glut of side stories here are as by the books as they come, repeating the same few mission structures that herd Clive from NPC to NPC. Close to a dozen of the sidequests simply ask me to talk to someone, speak to three NPCs stiffly standing around a town, and then go back to the quest-giver for more lore. Others have me fast-traveling somewhere to fight a battle that’s sometimes over in as little as 30 seconds before throwing me into another lengthy chat. Rinse, repeat

EDIT: the IGN review makes it sound like they get better by the end of the game at least:

>They actually start out pretty generic and menial, with objectives like finding X number of Y items out in the field, or delivering three hot bowls of soup to people in the hideout. However, in the back half of the story, these sidequests act as smart ways to button up all of the loose threads outside of the main campaign
What I'm getting from this is essentially: If you liked the demo, you'll like the game. If you didn't enjoy the demo, the game won't be for you.
    Sounds like the demo did a good job in that case

I admit the changes in the story delivery style, focus on combat, and a couple of lackluster locations did slightly bring it down for me. But in a series known for change, I feel this game changed the most and did that very well in the action parts and in the focus on the character and, for me, the writing.. It also offers an excellent group of NPC's, more interesting characters for me than most other titles, tight action, and Torgal the Dog!

A game with changes to almost everywhere, its going to be dissected for story content, story delivery, combat, its impact on the actual tried and true gameplay, and the subcategories in there. 

Pretty insane to see this much change in a game.
    “Changes in the story”? Would you mind expanding on what you mean by that?
        I watched the video and I think he meant as a its a more adult story than previous ff games which primarily focuses on one person rather than the party of players in other games which he prefers.
            The more mature story is one of the bigger hooks for me that sealed the deal.

Based on the demo and combat/gameplay I would have almost certainly gotten it anyway, but I personally prefer more adult/mature stories and a more 'kiddie' one would have poured some water on the entire thing for me.
                Yeah. The general tone of FF games prior kept me away from them. I played the NES and SNES ones as a kid, but never got much into anything after VI except Tactics. Seeing a trailer for the story then playing the demo had be very interested. I was just waiting for reviews to see if that tone and quality carried on for the full game and now I'm waiting for this pre-order download.
                    If you love tactics then you'll love this. The devs pretty much worship FFT with XIV having a whole mini arc with the characters and locations. I expect XVI will be the same.

Fun fact: The main characters kingdom Rozaria is a reference to the offscreen rival kingdom in FFT.
            I see that as an absolute positive for me. Give me the demo tone over a full game and it'll be one of my favourite games.
                This is indeed what you get basically.
                    Nice 👍
            The story kinda gives me an FF Tactics vibe tbh, which also primarily focuses on the protagonist's life. It's also very dark with a heavy political-theme.
            Is that true though?  FFVI never really had a primary protagonist and it's one of the greats
                That's what they're saying - this game focuses on the primary protagonist while most previous FF games split the story focus among the party.
                    Wow, I completely misread that, thought you were saying the opposite 😅
            This too and ya it is WAY more mature and it has to be. The stuff dealt with and talked about. It would have felt weird if they were like "silly darn Susan burned the muffins"
        I think he meant changes in tone. Tonally it's more mature than previous entries
            [deleted]
                FFXIV at its core is still a light hearted game though. I haven’t played or even looked much at FFXVI, but it may be that it’s gritty and dark all the time which would be a change of pace for this series.
                    read that there were plenty of lighthearted moments in one review
                and then they go and (EW Spoilers) >!Goomba stomp a kid in front of his dad right on screen. God that entire Final Days section was just brutal!<
            Some previous entries were pretty dark story-wise too, to be fair. FF6 for sure. You could probably argue FF7 as well.
                Honestly this is pretty much in line with most of the Ivalice world games. I know they rarely show up in the mainline titles, but a lot of the narrative feels very comparable to FF Tactics or Vagrant Story.
        More like story delivery style. I edited it. Its just very, very different in that way. It took a bit of getting accustomed to.
            Hmm interesting so it's not just gameplay->cutscene->gameplay repeat?
                > That to, at times. But more about, *I am worried about spoilers here sorry and we can't say a ton*, but the timeline changes and back and forth and who has done what where and what MIGHT be a cutscene turns into gameplay an stuff like that.
Cant dive into it much more than that.
                    At the very least it sounds like an interesting approach
                        It is for sure. I liked the slightly Game of thrones darker tones.
    [deleted]
    Seconding another reply- I’m curious what you mean by “changes in the story.”
        The core focuses tighter than many games before, the mature themes I discuss in the video, and how they are acted. Which I liked. But I can see people sort of thinking...weird. The first time some of the bits occur, or they watch a cutscene.
        I think what he meant changes in the story is that this final fantasy has a more mature story than others.
    Torgal is enough for me, also the writing, i love a game with a good amount of fucks
    Sounds like this review would be different if the game wasn't titled Final Fantasy.
    I knew Torgal was good for at least +2 score out of 10 the second I saw him! Good boy.
    Changes in the story? Like from what we saw in the demo?  Or changes from like the traditional FF trope?
    You mentioned in your review that it's not your favourite Final Fantasy by a long shot. Please can I ask which is, and where would you place XVI in the hierarchy?
91 right now! I missed when the mainline series was top tier 😭

Seems like Yoshi-P and crew knocked it out of the park!
    The last time a mainline, new Final Fantasy game pulled above a 90 on Metacritic was with FFXII, way back in 2006.
        And even that's wild given how utterly divisive FF12 was
            12 was divisive because the world wasn't ready for it yet. Mechanically and world wise its one of if not the best FF game. The gambit system was years ahead of the competition and is something a lot of games could benefit from. Its the only game where I am genuinely excited to see how the AI will handle a situation. Its a game where every new location is a joy to explore and years later people are still discussing party compositions due to how well balanced and expressive the job system in that game is.

Yes it has flaws like its story not being finished or the early game being a mess with you having to buy Gambits but even with those flaws its a brilliant game and one of the best FF games.
                > 12 was divisive because the world wasn't ready for it yet.

Hi, its me, I'm the problem its me. Granted I was like 14 when it released, I hated the mechanics. It wasn't until revisiting it a few years ago that I truly appreciated it.
                FFXII suffered by making Vaan the main character, for good reason. God he was annoying.

Also the gambit system would be niche today, it wasn't just ahead of its time, it straight up will never be for everyone, and that's okay.  Personally it is my least favourite battle system in the franchise besides 15s half-assed action approach. For perspective, my favourite is VII-Rs system, followed by X and XIII. I don't have issues with ATB either.

And like you said, the early game is so messy that it turns a lot of people off.
                    Vaan and Penelo were garbage characters and dragged down the experience and the story. The ending was also half-baked.

I personally loved the gambit system but can see why it's not for everyone.
                        You can tell the developer was afraid of having an older character as the main character for a final fantasy, so they created Vaan who is pretty unimportant to the story.
                Final Fantasy XII was the first FF game I played and the most appealing to me. I was extremely disappointed when the 13th part was not even close in gameplay to the previous game.
                    I still love FF13’s combat system. It takes way too long to unlock Paradigms but once you do it becomes an extremely engaging balancing act. Shame about the level design though.
            12 was the first of the mainline games I didn't enjoy and I still don't understand the appeal.

The narrative is the least interesting of all the Final Fantasy games I've played. It starts off promising and the character designs are amazing, but it just doesn't quite gel. When I learned years later that the original creator's vision was compromised by Square it made so much sense. All the pieces were there, but he wasn't given creative freedom to execute it the way he wanted.

And people rail on FFXIII for it's linear corridor exploring, but FFXII was the exact same and no one seems to mind. At least FFXIII had a solid narrative with characters that all made sense.
        Can we count shadowbringers and endwalker, they are basically new games with the size of the average 14 expansion
            MMO expansions get even more skewed from bias than regular releases, since only the dedicated are playing them in the first place
                and you have to be *hella dedicated* to get through ARR tbh

Took me 5 tries over years before finally sticking with it.
                    Yeah I've tried twice now. Never make it past level 20 or so. Really wanna get to the "great stories" later on but I literally am falling asleep when I try to play through ARR X_X
        > The last time a mainline, new Final Fantasy game pulled above a 90 on Metacritic was with FFXII

FF16 is sitting at 88 on metacritic: https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-5/final-fantasy-xvi

it never went above 90 on metacritic, was just on opencritic it did. 

90 now on opencritic: https://opencritic.com/game/14516/final-fantasy-xvi
        It's down to 88 on Metacritic which is what FF7R got. I don't understand why, I was banking on a 93 on open critic and I thought that was perhaps a little conservative (I did not want to entertain a 95 or higher despite how high quality the game seemed) but 88 on Metacritic and now down to 90 on Open Critic is beyond even my conservative estimate. A lot of the 70 reviews are complaining about the shallow RPG mechanics, simple combat (bullet sponge enemies that don't require much other than mindless burning of their healthbars), side quests or "overambitious"main story that fails to piece things together. Seems a wee bit more divisive than I expected. What a shame, I was thinking this game would embarrass 7R.
    Down to 88 by now.

I wonder if your companions will stand out or be as meaningful as the ones in Final Fantasy 15? I may be wrong but I feel like that game kind of divided people on if they liked it or not.

One thing it did for me though, more so then any game has ever done, was it got me really attached to my party. The game just did an absolutely amazing job of really making the player feel as if they were in this group of friends. I felt the comradery throughout the entire game. When the game ended I genuinely felt sad for a few minutes as it felt like I was leaving my friends. 

Maybe I'm just crazy or weird, but I've never had a game connect me so much with other characters as FF15 did. I really felt like I was experiencing really close friends come of age and just live their lives together.
    [deleted]
        i definitely did not appreciate it at the time but holy shit it really is the best bro trip game in the series.
        My favorite FF, damn sphere grid is so oddly satisfying.
    Hoo boy, if you want a game that makes you feel like you're close friends with the characters, then Persona 4 Golden may possibly be for you!

Final Fantasy XV is also the only other game besides the Persona games that made me feel like that.
    I’m on your side. There were a lot of things that were kinda mediocre about 15, but the characters were well realized and I easily got attached. The campfire scene at the end had me in tears. FFX is the only other FF to make me so attached to the characters.
    That's one of FF15's goals and it did it really really well. It always struck me as lame when people criticize the game but completely missed or ignored what it did well. There is true history with your party because they're not colleagues or randoms you picked up to do a task. They're childhood friends and it shows in the narrative, characterization, and game mechanics/
    I genuinely loved Noctis and the bros and it's why I put so many hours into that game, the party chemistry was so great. It reminded me a lot of old Bioware games where I would walk around just to hear what people were going to say.
    ff15’s party dynamic was definitely a strong point
    FF15 does some things incredibly well and other things incredibly poorly; whether people like it comes down to whether they think the good parts are enough to outweigh the bad.

The party characters are the perfect example of this. I've still yet to play another game where the ai companions were anywhere near as good as in FF15. They actually feel like friends, and have an insane amount of dialogue for the overworld.

Unfortunately most of that is missed if you don't spend a ton of time in side quests, hearing all of their dialogue and reactions to different things, and FF15 has absolutely awful sidequests.
    It doesn't match XV in that (which was the first FF to have the entire party already be established BFFs, which helps with the chemistry) but it's still good. I definitely feel like there are character's I feel invested in. Cid and Jill are both solid characters as well.
    > One thing it did for me though, more so then any game has ever done, was it got me really attached to my party.

You *must* play the Persona games. PS5 Royal is the most modern one and a great game that delivers on this, but PS4 Golden might be the best example of friendship and camaraderie *ever*. So good in that particular area
Another great hit for the year it seems (though I feel like pretty much everyone knew this since weeks or months and there's really no surprise there). 

Damn, 2023 is really stacked. And we're only at the middle of the year.

I'm not a player of JRPG in general (and never played a Final Fantasy actually) but this one is definitively on my list (and actually preordered).
    If you end up enjoying FFXVI, I'd highly recommend FFVII Remake. While it's definitely more of a **J**RPG, it's got a pretty good story. Even if you don't know the original, it's still a very enjoyable game.
        It's in my backlog too. All the FF kind of are I guess but I actually own this one, just haven't got around to play it
            I love the FF games, but if you aren't a big fan of JRPGs, especially if you don't like turn based combat, then it might be hard to go back to the first 10 mainline games. Just know that every numbered mainline game is completely unrelated to the others. There is no overarching story from 1-15 leading into 16. There have been sequels, prequels, and spin-offs of some of them though. 

1-6 are pixel based classic games. With the pixel remasters, that's the easiest and most convenient way to play them all. They mostly are similar with different mechanics introduced in each. 

7, 8, and 9 were all PS1 era games each with HD remasters. 7 has the first 3D graphics of the series, and it looks rough, even with the HD remaster. They all run on the same engine and are often considered a trilogy of sorts, but still had no relation to each other. 

10 is the first one with voice acting and the graphics were a huge step up at the time. It has a direct sequel (10-2).

11 and 14 are literally MMOs that take hundreds of hours to get through (look up a recap of you'd like). They seem like good games, but not an MMO kinda guy. 

12 was decent but it was the first (single player) step away from turn based combat. It plays almost identically to the first Dragon Age if you happen to have played that. It has at least a spinoff

FF13 and it's 2 sequels are harder to play if you don't have a PS3 or Xbox with backwards compatibility (emulation may be possible). They're the only ones I haven't played enough to remember. I started 13, but it just didn't click for me at the time. If I remember right, they tried a more action based approach to a turn based combat. I want to give them a fair try, but haven't had the chance. 

15 was unique and more of a hack and slash type gameplay, with a very different style. I really enjoyed 15, but I know I'm in the minority there. 

If you play FF7 Remake I'd also **highly** recommend the prequel Crisis Core Reunion. I love it's story and it has some very interesting tie in with the remake and it's sequel.
I just wish the combat was more engaging. I don't find there is ever any threat of dying in a boss battle. I just don't see alot of people playing this game after they beat it once. Unlike Elden ring where the combat is competitive even after beating it you still want to spend time mastering it and exploring every part of the world. I just can't justify the price either why is ff16 base copy 15 dollars CAD more then Elden ring. It's not like it got more content, more epuipment to find, better combat. Yes it got a better story and graphics but that's it. I bought it regardless but still it's nothing special to warrant the price. I'm enjoying it but once I beat it I will never touch it again unlike Elden ring. Also I would argue that this game is not a rpg. It's just a action game

    Don‘t ask me, I‘m waiting for the Xbox port
        I don’t believe it’ll be ever coming to Xbox.
My review (Brazilian portuguese) - 10/10: [https://criticalhits.com.br/reviews/final-fantasy-xvi-16-analise-review-vale-a-pena/](https://criticalhits.com.br/reviews/final-fantasy-xvi-16-analise-review-vale-a-pena/)

&#x200B;

Final Fantasy XVI is a true next-gen experience on PlayStation 5. The game combines one of the most mature and well-crafted plots in the history of the franchise, with charismatic and multi-layered characters, together with and an extremely fun combat system, especially when the Eikons fight, an unique visual presentation.  
  
The result of this is a game that will mark the fans and hardly be forgotten anytime soon, and make those who don't have a PS5 want to buy the console to enjoy this incredible experience.
After reading a small handful of reviews it seems that the main negative points are:

* Open areas are empty and not very interesting to explore

* Boring fetch sidequests

* Some major characters should have been more interesting

* Some complaints about lack of RPG systems

* Playable but not great framerate in performance mode ~~(not clear if tested with the day 1 patch)~~
    > Playable but not great framerate in performance mode (not clear if tested with the day 1 patch)

Digital Foundry just did a tech review that mentioned the day 1 patch not making much of a diffeerence in performance. Seems like it drops the resolution in battle though, which boosts the framerate to a stable 60fps.

I hope 40fps / VRR will be implemented in this game though, as that will likely solve a lot of peoples issues with 30fps.
    >Open areas are empty and not very interesting to explore

>Boring fetch sidequests

>Some complaints about lack of RPG systems

Ah there's the FFXIV influence
        Yeah this is what I was expecting after XIV tbh.

Definitely not CBU3's forte.
            what you don't like having large pretty environments except restricted by the one narrow path the player is allowed to walk in? ff14 is abysmal at exploration, other games do it so much better
                14 is terrible for exploration but in the exact opposite direction 

Starting with HW and areas designed with flying in mind every single area is just a giant open bowl with absolutely nothing of value inside it
            [deleted]
                The story of the sidequests is usually good. The gameplay...is not.
    > Open areas are empty and not very interesting to explore

oh hey, an homage to FF14
    "Open areas are empty and not very interesting to explore"

Whelp they really did take alot of inspiration from FF14 didn't they
    Important to note that the complaint about side quests seem to pertain mostly to the first half of the game, and the second half of the game has excellent side quests
        I heard the opposite, some say the game falls off the second half where even main quest starts to feel like sidequest.
            There seems to be a trend in the reviews that says the second half is much stronger but I don’t doubt that some people think otherwise
    [deleted]
    I felt that playing the demo, from both the 2 hours and the Eikon challenge part. The story was interesting, but the actual wandering around until you get to a new cutscene was super dull and generic.
How are people praising this game yet were so against Final Fantasy 13 for being linear?
    FFXIII has more anime-ish style and plot. This one is "realistic medieval European", GoT inspired, so ofc it's better/s
    The storytelling in 16 is much better. 13 had a really compelling story but I literally had to read it all through the logs to understand what was going on because the actual gameplay provided no clarity. Plus the game “opens up” a lot more a lot quicker.
>players are forced to play the entire game in easy mode

Spaziogames states this but I pretty sure you could choose your difficulty option at the start. Then, the new game plus open up the difficulty even further.
    I did find the demo pretty easy, but I have to wonder how much of this is because of how much souls games have warped the difficulty curve of the AAA space.
        all the complaints i've seen are pretty valid, the first playthrough on action mode is too easy for most of the mechanics to ever be used.

i always replay these games so i'm fine with it being moderately challenging while i'm focused on the story and then NG+ being wild, that sounds like a good middle ground. i guess they could make NG+ available from the start, but that would be a worse mode imo, since wouldn't have your full suite of tools.

i like how they're doin it!
        God of War 2018 let you start on GMGoW difficulty immediately and while it was frustrating at times that's what I signed up for and am happy it gave me the choice.
        It’s warped some people/groups to the point of brainrot unfortunately.
            It's called personal preference... I also want hard mode by default instead of needing to earn it
    Depends on what you consider difficulty,at the start it's either with the accessories pre-equipped or without them.
    The higher difficulty shouldn't be in locked after you finish the game. This is not a 5 hour long game. People that like challenges will get bored.
    Yeah I’m about 15 hours in. The two options are “story heavy” or “ action heavy” which pretty much means mash one button for cool move or learn the combos. Idk been playing if I get hit once I gotta start the level over.
First I'll start off, I play FF for the story and characters.  Not everyone does.  People are gonna hate me for saying this.  But there were parts of this game that were an utter slog.  First 3-5 hours of the story was fantastic.  But then it just meanders.  Wish there had been more screen time and character development on several NPCs.  I actually preferred Stranger of Paradise to this, in that regard.  It kinda bored me after a certain point.  Hope others had a better experience.
All seem to be 9/10 apart from one review from Digital Trends, but looking at the guys review history it doesn't look like he actually enjoys any games.
    Most of his reviews are a 6/10. I think he's in the wrong job lol
        Bruh he rated The Callisto Protocol and Ghostwire: Tokyo higher than both FF16 and Crisis Core remake.
            Ghostwire Tokyo is higher than ff16? Now that's funny.
                Callisto is such a bad game lol. It’s like they modded one section of dead space and you keep redoing that spot 1000 times
                I absolutely love Ghostwire (I’ve 100%ed it twice) but even I think that sounds like quite the take based on the FF16 demo.
            We are in for a weird time where Tales of Arise has a better metacritic score than FFXVI

Reviews are a funny thing when looked at  from a distance
                Not that weird, Tales of Arise is superb.
                    I first half of Tales of Arise is superb, the latter portions I found to be less so (not much less, but still less).
                    >Tales of Arise is superb.

Is it? I thought it was average. Xenoblade 3 that came out not long after was far superior.
            That's just absurd. Calistos combat system was borderline broken from a fundamental level
        could be someone who subscribes to the notion that 5/10 means average and 6/10 is already a positive score. Similar to how YourMovieSucks rates movies.

It's not a bad system as it allows for a bit more nuance that the standard "10=great, 9=good, 8=mostly good, 7=disappointing, 6 and lowe = literal garbage" ranking used for video games.

There are some implications when it comes to actively swimming against the stream (like developers bonuses tied to metascore rankings) but at least in isolation it's not an inherently good or bad thing to use a different scale
            One problem with scoring that way is video games can go much lower than movies. Movie reviews don't generally have to deal with the movie crashing.
                I feel like most of the time technical issues are left out of the review score and instead are mentioned as a warning separate from it. I mean, look at the review scores of highly buggy (at lunch) games like cyberpunk, Witcher, Skyrim etc.

When a buggy game gets bad review scores then it's usually because the critics aren't a big fan of the game to begin with (forspoken, fallout 76 at launch etc)
        I wish most reviewers averaged scores in that range...

    These were his main issues:

Uneven story  
Disappointing character arcs  
Dull sidequests  
Shallow RPG systems

If you think these are important in an arpg and this game doesn't do well in them, then it makes sense to lower the score. The thing is, even the positive reviews mention at least half of this, they probably don't think it's as big of a problem.
    I don't think he enjoys story driven games... So I'm not sure why the fuck he's playing final fantasy
        I suppose it can be useful for people who hate story driven games to see how someone who also hates story driven games reviews a game.
        It’s always good to have opinions from people who aren’t usually into them sort of games, if it was only FF fans or JRPG fans then the reviews would be incredible biased.
    I actually think there's an oversaturation of 9/10 and 10/10 reviews in the gaming community. 10/10 loses meaning when so many games get that. 10/10 means literal perfection so it should not be thrown around casually.

6/10 is actually above average. Idk why the gaming community is so behind in terms of reviews. Movies and TV shows constantly get 5/10s and that's acceptable. Gaming community has a taboo it seems.
I was looking forward to this heavily probably like most fans but the only thing I like about it is the boss battles. The side missions are too repetitive and most of them are pointless. I mean everything really is repetitive thoughout the whole game except the boss battle. With such good graphics they let me down with the map layouts. Most of the maps are very dull and boring. The only time I ever even get amazed at what I'm looking is once again the boss battles. And it's kinda dumb the new sword u get is only good for one mission then there's a better one lol. I completely agree how this feels like a devil may cry game not a final fantasy. Every bit of player design, what he says, and how he moves and attacks is reminiscent of Dante. Hopefully this was just to hold us over until rebirth. If rebirth letse down too I will be highly upset
Story:7.5/10. Boring at times. Moments were I was falling asleep and I shouldn’t of been tired lol. However I did find my self wondering what would happen. It did capture my interest for the most part.
Graphics:9/10. Fighting cut scenes are great. Still seems like their could be more. It’s very dark and depressing. No Wall Market type city. No lights. All seems very games if thrones.
Fighting:8/10 repetitive. Bring back turn base!!!!  I don’t want to play an action game. The ff series was popular with turn base. This is a no talent game that you just smash buttons. Some of the moves were cool and it gave me ambition to upgrade them.

The cities are almost walking dead. No bustling cities at all. Little city talk, no background noise at all. It’s not vibrant and NPCs are just shit. Theyre sooooo boring acting and looking. The loot system is as basic as it gets. The weapon and armor system are basic as well. Literally 90’s final fantasies and other rpgs are far better. It’s nuts to me. You wear the same out fit basically all game. Your sword changes appearance but that’s it. The crafting is basic and elementary. The side missions are shit and sooo boring. Skipped the dialogue in 90% of them. 

It seems that ff16 is catering to a young, ignorant audience. They focused on cinematic scenes and graphics. That’s it. Everything else is just lazy. 

The magic system is restricted and repetitive af.

I can’t tell you how much I love hitting an enemy 3,000 times before they die. It’s fucking silly. What person in history can take 20 sword strikes. FF most basic enemy’s that are levels under you still take 15 basic strikes to kill. It’s mind blowing.
 
The map is limited and you can’t interact with anything. Your character animations are basically nonexistent when you run around. Ff7 had a bigger map and more towns. Had more things to do. This game is so limited it’s crazy. 
How about letting me race chocobos or letting me breed them. What about letting me having diverse weapons or outfits. Hairstyles, armor. Like wtf. It’s all so elementary and basic.
Overall 5/10. 
 How can a series like this go so fucking backwards. I remember skipping school to play ff7. The only thing this game has going for it are the fighting cutscenes and the story. That’s it.
Spaziogames review is weird. 

Paraphrasing: "Yeah it's nothing special. Story is good but you'll forget the rest of the ezpz pie in an hour. 8 out of 10 tho".

We're living in the world where anything less than an 8 is apparently utterly unplayable.
    We are living in a world where the reviewers are too afraid to upset the publishers and get their game advance taken away. It's all bullshit.

Now that I'm older, I feel that all the cons these reviewers states are really just positive points for me.

No open world and no incentive to explore? All good, I got no time to run around a giant map. Show me what I need to see and let me move on asap.

No ailments? Perfect. They were annoying anyways. 

Lack of skills and in-depth character build. Perfect I dont need 30 skills. Recently finished GoW 2018 and I only really used 4 5 skills for the whole campaign. Crafted only 3 sets of equipment.

But to each their own. Cant wait for tomorrow.
    100%. Ailments I'm kinda sad about but the lack of big, open world maps are dead to me. I'd rather have a linear story told well and a combat system that's fun.
        There is a middle ground between open world and hallway level design.

Games like Dark Souls, Resident Evil, the recent God of War games, or the Metroidvania genre in general have interesting levels that offer satisfying exploration, without being open world.

Hallway levels are just awful, there is no excuse to ever have that in any AAA action RPG.

If you look at some of the classic FF games, the story was linear but not the spaces you explored.

FF16 has short, empty hallways. I'm not asking for an open world, I just want the bare minimum effort put into level design so I can actually get a little bit of exploration in my video game.

They create these beautiful, fascinating environments, and you can't engage with them at all. You're on a guided tour. Look but don't touch.

You hold up for 15 seconds, then you get a battle, then a cutscene, then up for 15 seconds again, rinse and repeat.

At that point why even give us control to walk around at all? It's literally pointless, I don't need to be holding up for 15 seconds.

All this game has to offer is cutscenes and battles so they might as well just auto-load us into battle after each cutscene ends because there's really no reason to ever give you control to walk around.
Demo really sold me on the story and the game itself. 

Gonna be nice to dive into this during the upcoming holiday break.
> Final Fantasy XVI forgets what is really important for the series. It's impossibile to create a build and there's nothing important left for you to manage through the menus. Proper RPG options are gone, dungeons are just banal corridors, players are forced to play the entire game in easy mode and you can beat the game with literally no effort. There's a decent base for the future, but it's not enough to see a real rebirth for the saga.

And somehow they gave it an 8/10?  The endless cutscenes must be really good I guess
Just finished first play through (no spoilers) and wanted to give my thoughts. 

The bad:
1. Pacing (0/10) — Break the story into thirds.

a) The opening narrative and setup is excellent. 

b) The middle section is awful and boring. 

c) The final 1/3 is almost as good as the first narrative section — but it is set back by terrible side quest dump in the last act that probably comes close to accounting for half the side quests in the game.

2. Setting/Universe (Subjective, 3/10):
This has not been discussed enough. With too few exceptions, the environments are mostly barren & unimaginative. Every town looks and feels the same. It just did not immerse me. I thought that FF9 and 10 did their worlds the best.

I like Diablo & I like GoT. I also get that it’s part of the story, but this FF tries so hard to be “mature” and bleak… in practice, it just comes off as a bore. 

FF7 is a good comparison because it was also bleak with a fair amount of brown and grey industrial/slummy environments — but the mystery and sci-fi elements managed to spice things up without taking away from the tone.

The great:
1. Combat (10/10)
I have played every FF since VI and did not miss RPG elements a bit here. The action combat feels smooth and is enjoyable. Is the game too easy? Meh, I think that’s overblown.

It’s not “punishing”, but that doesn’t mean it’s mindless or “easy”. This game’s implementation of the parry mechanic is arguably a revolution in action combat. Watch some vids on it (but master your dodge counter first).

Surprisingly tons of combat customization & replayability — just less focus on equipment/stats & more focus on ability combinations/accessories.

2. Music (10/10) - right there with X fighting for best in series

3. Animation/Visuals (9/10)
About as good as it gets here in the cutscenes and battles. Again, environments are another story, with too few exceptions. 

The Overrated:
1. Story (6.5/10) - the high water marks for the series as a narrative gaming experience are VI, VII, IX, and X. Nothing has changed with this.

This was thought out and doesn’t have too many holes, but it’s just not executed well & lacks imagination. I won’t spoil anything — but the criticism relates very closely to the points made about pacing and setting.


Verdict: 
Can’t Miss this if you are a FF fan, especially if XV is what turned you off. 

Excluding remake, this is probably the best mainline FF game we have had since X. 

That’s a major statement — The disappointment is that it could have (and maybe should) have been even better. 

The good news is this is a huge step forward from XV for the main series — the boss battles are must-see material & combat alone makes this an enjoyable experience (also have Remake Part II on deck).
Seeing all the near-perfect scores pouring in. Picking it up myself as we speak. Well done Yoshi P and co.
This is one of the most boring games I’ve ever played. It’s a fucking cutscene simulator. You walk down a hallway, watch a cutscene, fight in a circular arena of some sort, watch a cut scene, walk down another hallway, watch a cutscene, fight in a circular arena, pick a new place on the world map, repeat.

Legit one of the worst final fantasy games I have ever played. What a disappointment.
It's kind of hard to not be a homebody anymore when every month there is a badass game being released
Amazing return to form for the series. Yoshi P and CBU3 cannot get enough praise for what they've accomplished here. 

Tim from Kinda Funny just said "this is the best Final Fantasy ever made". From a FF nut, that is a crazy statement and I can't believe Square have pulled it off.
>Eikon fights, while not as interesting to play, are gorgeous to witness

This was my biggest fear with those. They are basically God of War QTEs when they should be difficult fights.
    If it’s anything like the demo the QTE moments are interspersed in the fights and only serve to stagger the enemy or do extra damage
        Or for phase transitions.
        I mean, the rest of that first eikon fight was just holding triangle and moving the cursor. It wasn't super in-depth or engaging. 

That being said, it was only the first one of these in the game so I assume they get more hands on and interesting as the game continues.
    id rather they stay GOW QTEs tbh
        💯 they're spectacles that happen every once in a while. You can't make them complex with heavy mechanics that you gotta learn.
            Why not? Honest question.
                I don't think the Eikon battles are gonna happen often enough for you to be able to grasp a completely new and varied moveset.
                Probably because it's a waste of time and resource to develop a complex mechanics for something that you do for maybe 7 times in the whole game.
                    Every fight will be different mechanically too IIRC
        Asura's Wrath was awesome and that's basically the whole game
            I liked how Metal Gear Rising did QTEs.
        Having JUST finished GoW (2018) yesterday... that last boss fight actually slapped, even though I usually dislike QTE's they made it look & feel great.
        Same.  I get easily frustrated by gimmick fights, so I'd rather just have those fights be a glorified interactive cutscenes and have the gameplay focus be on Clive.
        I don't think I've ever experienced a QTE event I wouldn't rather have just experienced as a cutscene where I could put the controller down and enjoy the spectacle instead of sitting on edge scanning for prompts.
    Yeah this was a minor concern of mine as well. Overall I feel like it’s just going to be more of a small gripe than a genuine issue but it is still a bummer that they’re more “gimmicky” than anything
    TBH, with how excellent the base combat is, it's easy to forgive and even appreciate some spectacle fluff. if it was all flash and no substance I'd call it a big knock against the game but obviously this isn't the case.
    The demo eikon fight was worse than GOW QTE's honestly. It was just me moving the cursor to track the enemy and dodge with a button everytime he lunges at me, for like 5minutes. Either have it be a challenge to do these fights or just let me watch the cool animations that's not this repetitive. 

Very minor gripe in an otherwise great demo though.
As a big fan of 14, I figured CBU3 would deliver. 

Love the more adult tone they went with. Not that other FF's didn't have mature/adult themes, but this is the first to present them in such a raw and direct way.

Like watching The Last Duel or Game of Thrones.

Edit: There's a missable trophy. For those who care about platinum as well, do not >!sell your materials.!<
that Polygon review is terrible, incredibly overdramatic.

Feels like I'm reading a students first draft and they're trying to impress me.

Eurogamer is just taking the piss however, the same score as REDFALL???

Damn, game journos really wanted some attention today.
    I guess I'm confused what you specifically felt made this review worse then others?

It was pretty positive about the game overall, but basically "I play FF for the plot, but the plot wasn't interesting to me" seems to summarize their main issue with the game. Is that a problem? ~~Are reviewers not criticize the plot in video games?~~
        "I like this game therefore any reviewer who dislikes it is wrong"

The same people who complain that critic score doesn't mean anything nowadays are usually the same to screech whenever a publication gives an outlier score.
    u folks are being way more dramatic than that review is
    Polygon is more or less a college student newspaper with a focus on videogames.
        The whole rant about the slavery part is like:

this is why games writers don't go after complex subjects in their games, because people bitch about it but if they're not there; they'll bitch about that too. Can't win.
            > this is why games writers don't go after complex subjects in their games, because people bitch about it but if they're not there; they'll bitch about that too. Can't win.

Are we at the point where "slavery is bad" is considered a "complex subject"? If anything, I feel like it's the opposite of a complex issue, at least when you are just tackling the issue head on.
                You can't make slavery a complex at all subject because morally it's wrong and the moment you even try to justify it economically or culturally it's gonna be a PR shitshow.
            I wouldn't go that far. There's a school of thought that games are chill entertainment first, and if they don't dissect really complex and thorny social issues with nuance and care, that's ok. 

Then there's another school of thought which views games and movies as art forms on par with literature or more "serious" movies, and if they bring up a real world issue, they better damn well treat that issue with respect. 

Which reviews speak to you depend, IMO, on which school you subscribe to. I know I've seen movies before, where I look at the reviews and wonder whether critics have watched the same movie I have, simply because we had different ideas on how topics should be treated in films.
            Is slavery = bad really a complex topic, though? Like the criticism isn't "the game has slavery", it's that "MC realizing slavery is bad" is a very weak and tired plot hook. Whether you agree with that or not, I don't think you're characterizing it fairly; the problem Gita seems to have is that it discards interesting/complex topics for a simple slavery plot
                I don’t think its that outlandish for Clive to realize its wrong later in life. Dude grew up as a child soldier in a world where slavery is literally the only thing keeping these nations functioning.
                    Well, there are two things here.

First, in-game, Clive is already visibly uncomfortable with slavery as a child and then literally sold into slavery. It may be hard to square this with a realize slavery is wrong plot, which Gita notes.

Second, the criticism isn't necessarily that the plot doesn't make sense, it's a criticism of the plot the writers chose. The game can justify an MC realizing slavery is wrong but the writers still had to decide that was the story they wanted to tell and Gita clearly finds that story pretty boring and tired.
                    True, but it doesn't change the fact that "slavery is bad" isn't a complex topic to tackle. I get that in the world of FF16 that may be an incredible revelation, but in storytelling in general, that isn't some great narrative feat.
                        Who says it’s an incredible revelation? It comes in the first 3 hours of the game when Clive gets to the hideout.  It’s a 30 hour rpg.
                    Not only that - he grew up as a son of the ruler (even if not chosed to be the Dominant), so his grew up as part of a royalty and not common folk. 

And even then, in the prologue he treats branded man just like any other person, so he has a kind heart
                    A story having a good internal logic doesn't automatically make the story good, or make it not trite. It can both be true that Clive thinking slavery okay for a time makes sense for him and the world and the story of any character thinking slavery was okay is lame by the standards of today. Look at Avatar 1. That director puts his foot into the worldbuilding, it's kind of insane, and ~~people loved that movie~~ it made an equally insane amount of money. It's still FernGully. Or The Last Samurai. Or the older movies I can't remember.
                        [Dan Olson made a really good video about this that he calls the "Thermian Argument"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxV8gAGmbtk). Alternatively known as Watsonian perspective.
                            I'm a Folding Ideas fan but I've never seen this video. Thanks, this is everything I mean, and surely what Polygon's talking about.
                Clive grew up a spoiled lordling, it's not a far step.

Rich people live in bubbles, I think it's pretty accurate. 

I know it's a joke but 'what could a banana cost? 10 dollars?' comes to mind.
                    It might make sense logically, but that doesn't make it any more interesting. "Privileged man realizes slavery bad" is a very well-worn arc that often comes off as dull and pointless unless the story has something new to say.

No idea how well it plays out in-game, haven't played it, but feeling it chose a tired premise and did nothing with it is valid criticism for a story-focused game.
                Eh most plot hooks can sound weak and like something that's been done countless times already if you try to summarise it in one sentence.

Don't misunderstand I'm not saying whether FF XVI story is great/bad because I obviously haven't played the game already. I'm only saying, just because the plot hook have been done already, doesn't make it bad. It's the execution that matters.

For example "A good man turns bad due to life circumstances" is something that's been done countless times before and sounds tiring as fuck, but that doesn't change the fact that Breaking Bad is one of the best shows of all time and Walt's slowly becoming more and more fucked up with each season is a joy to follow.
                    Sure, the game could be great, and most reviews are super positive on the story. I’m more noting that the criticism from Polygon is very understandable and not absurd, especially since it doesn’t even affect the precious metascore. People having very different takes and tastes than others isn't always a sign of bad faith or whatever.
            Maybe they're complaining because they, uh, thought the game handled the subject poorly?

Dunno how the scenario of "you asked for this to be in the game, this game did it badly, and you're criticizing it for handling it badly? checkmate" unironically became a "gotcha" people use.
            Is that true tho? Maybe not in most mainstream games, but thats true for most pop culture in every form of entertainment and most media. It's mostly about applying to the lowest denominator and selling well. There's plenty of indies and AA games that go for more. Besides that, gamer's love to complain about things being "woke" online
            When you make a serious game with serious topics, you are going to have more criticism when you don't handle themes, topics, etc. well. That's just regular criticism.
    How is it overdramatic? The developers clearly want players to engage with the story on a deep level because they’ve been tripping over their dicks for months trying to sell the idea of a “mature” Final Fantasy, and the Polygon reviewer did just that. It seems that, despite all of Yoshi-P’s promising, we’ve gotten your run-of-the-mill FF tale but with way more graphic violence and language with some sex thrown in there for good measure, and I’m not surprised at all that some people think it’s a waste.
    Jesus, that’s a joke to give it the same score as Redfall. If you didn’t like FF16 then fair enough, but Redfall was basically a barely functional product. And the “barely functional” is very arguable

    Don’t the rings help with skill issues but not really accessibility? If you’re vision impaired or hard of hearing, does the game offer options for those (basic examples are high contrast mode, visual indicators for audio cues, etc.).
        Yes for hard of hearing.
        I don't know about high contrast mode, but it does have an option to turn on a visual indicator for audio cues (and of course it has sub-titles).
    Compare it to accessibility settings in Last of Us 2. This is why the rings received critisms when they were revealed to be the accessibility settings when accessibility settings are supposed to be so much more than just making the game easier.
Currently 88 on metacritic, don't know why they stopped putting that in the OP for these threads.

https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-5/final-fantasy-xvi?ref=hp
    Because Opencritic offers a direct to reddit export option and Metacritic doesn't. The template you see from every review thread here is from there.
    u/Turbostrider27 not planning in adding metacritic? it has over 90 reviews compared to 60 reviews opencritic.
My review on an Estonian site: [https://mkuubis.ee/2023/final-fan](https://mkuubis.ee/2023/final-fantasy-xvi/)[tasy-xvi/](https://mkuubis.ee/2023/final-fantasy-xvi/)  


Loved the game, but I missed the strategy elements in combat. There are no status effects or elemental strengths/weaknesses.
    > There are no status effects or elemental strengths/weaknesses.

Oh, that sucks.
    Aw, I can do without elemental weaknesses since it's never really been big in FF but lack of status effects is a bummer.
I've played for around four hours so far and if those are any indication at all, this is going to be a very, *very* special experience. I'm beyond hyped by how good it is.
How newbie friendly is this game?

I never played a final fantasy game, so i have no experience with this franchise whatsoever.

Is this game a sequel to one/some of the prior games or is this a new story one can enjoy without any prior knowledge?
    Each Final Fantasy is an independent entry.
Thank god it’s not open world , I have so many open world games to complete - I just never will. I miss more linear games. Especially now that I’m getting older.
Long time FF fan here. Almost done with the game. I give this 7/10. The game lacks polish in cutscenes (awkward when it’s just machina instead of acting), and graphics feel lacking sometimes. Its side quests can be sometimes boring, and there isn’t much freedom with equipment optimization. 

I really really appreciate its Active Time Lore feature and their gorgeous cutscenes during the climaxes, though. The high points are really well done.
Played the demo and then went into the main game.

Thoughts -

Demo was good, not great. Story seems ok so far.

The first eikon "fight" dragged on far too long. Should have been a bitchin 90-120 second cinematic but was instead dragged out to 5-10 minute on rails quick time event. REALLY hope they all aren't like this.

In fact, most fights are too long until you figure out how to use your eikon abilities. Then it's just use aoe and kill all monsters in 1 hit. Wish there was middle ground.

All the zones feel very linear. The forest was the absolute worst. Walk for 3 seconds, see a clearing, hop down, fight. Repeat 6-10 times and that's the entire zone. Very repetitive, and not in a good way.

Frame rate issues even in performance mode for the flashier scenes. Overall the game looks good but doing in game cutscenes instead of pre renders fucks up the fps, looks weird and was clearly done for cost saving. Feels bad after they just jacked the price up 10 bucks.

Went to bed after getting to the second "town." Probably would have played more if this felt like a 10/10 game but so far feels more like 7.5/10. Was very excited, now not so much. Still having fun, but not as much as I'd hoped. Ff7R was much more enjoyable so far. I have a feeling ill like this story more, but like that better as a game. Guess we will see.
    People don't seem to like an honest opinion, jesus.
        Yep. You can't criticize shit these days without getting assblasted by fan boys.


The game is far from perfect. Very far. From performance, to pacing, to just not even feeling like a final fantasy game (not the turn based complaint). Exploration is meaningless. Shiny blue markers for items to get 2 Gil is a joke. I'm multiple hours into the game now and haven't found any real items. Inventory maxing out potions is dumb since the game let's you put it into easy mode anyway. Fighting a giant boss for 5 mins gives 60 xp, fighting 3 humans with 3 eiikon abilities in 5 seconds gives 30 xp. The ability system feels bad, you just spam cooldownd asap. 

It feels like they wanted to make a movie and then somewhere realized that they had to make a game as well and tacked that on. 


I paid my 70 bucks, so I'm going to grind it out, but it already feels like a chore instead of fun. They really missed the mark imo.
Some reviews praise the story and others say it is boring and the worst part of the game. The demo had me hooked on the story and I know I’m going to play it, but wish there was a more in depth but spoiler free story review if such a thing exists.

15 was fun but the story was almost non-existent, so the bar is on the floor anyways.
I've had access to a review copy. The things people are excited about are great; namely story, music and combat. 

For me personally, the rest falls into mediocre to good territory. Doesn't mean that will be the case for everybody, of course, and I do think most people who are excited will enjoy the game immensely.
    Well, story, music and combat are the most important elements in a game, so this sounds awesome.
        For this kind of game, definitely. It's not like the problems detract too much from the core, which is why I said most will probably enjoy it.
From Eurogamer  
\>The world is also conspicuous for its ethnic homogeneity, which producer Naoki Yoshida has explained as a reflection of the "geographical, technological, and geopolitical constraints" of medieval Europe. Leaving aside the fact that there /were/ Black and brown people in medieval Europe, this justification rings hollow given that several locations take open inspiration from north Africa and the Middle East, with towns that, for example, riff on Islamic architectural traditions and attire, but are predominantly or exclusively populated by anglophone white people (I hedge, here, simply because I haven't been around and talked to everybody). I find the deletion of people of colour from these spaces more sinister than the racial stereotypes of older Final Fantasies, particularly in a game that wants to talk about overcoming structural injustice and bringing people together. That "togetherness" is worth fighting for, but it's characterized here by what it excludes.

Yeah let's not review the game, just talk about your racist biases. By the way eurogamer does not have a single black employee.
    Racist biases? Where are you getting that from?

        [removed]
    It's a choice the game makes, and if it was distracting enough to bother the reviewer then it bears mentioning. I certainly wouldn't agree with the characterization as "sinister" but it's not unreasonable to note that regions drawing heavily from non-white cultures are exclusively populated by white people.
    You pulled this from a massive review that does talk about the actual game, though? 

I don't see what's wrong with pointing out these things. People are allowed to have differing opinions or level of caring about these topics. For this reviewer, it was important enough to them to take away from their enjoyment of the game, and that could be useful information for someone else too. And in my opinion it's something that people should be thinking about more often than they do. 

>By the way eurogamer does not have a single black employee.

It feels weird to make this argument while also attacking that paragraph from the article. Does diversity matter or not? 

Both things can be a problem at the same time. Also, I'm sure the reviewer has no say in the hiring process.
        > It feels weird to make this argument while also attacking that paragraph from the article. Does diversity matter or not?

In this instance it's rather clear the OP wants to highlight the hypocrisy.
    What are the racist biases
    I can never understand the American obsession with race and representation. I'm a Filipino, we never get this sort of stuff in media. Am I happy when there is? Sure, but I'm not going to play or watch something just because there's representation. I'm not gonna dock points from something if there isn't either.
        >the American obsession with race and representation

Tbf this wasn't even written by an American; it's a British writer in a publication literally called Eurogamer.
            Honestly, British is so Americanized at this point.

    If it's like 12, I can see myself glazing over during any of those "sit around a table and talk about how Kingdom Fluxia is attacking the Kingdom of Luneri while allying with the disgraced Archduchy of Flenth\*" cutscenes.

&#x200B;

\*not actual names or plot points.
    Coming from ffxiv it seems to me like they added "quiet moments" like in ffxiv, where characters will just sit around and enjoy each others company for a bit. I enjoy these scenes but it's definitely not for everyone.
        I can appreciate those scenes sometimes but I feel that they were way over done in Endwalker.
            Nod. Nod. Chest bump. Nod.
                No fist clench?
    Yeah, [Jason Schreier has posted he's not a fan of the last third of the game.](https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1671893813915439104?s=20)

[Gene Park also found the ending disappointing overall.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2023/06/21/final-fantasy-xvi-16-review-video-game/)
I think this game will be one where after a few months everyone will be talking about how the critics reviews were way too kind.

This is even less “Final Fantasy” than the last couple of single player main line installments.

For me FFVII part 2 is the next final fantasy.
I've been mostly enjoying it so far,and it's a beautiful game but man those 3 arrows indicating what to hop over or go through next every half minute really break the immersion, especially when the HUD goes off. Could it kill them to make it less obvious? Does it even have to be there? Can it not also  overlay your character?
[deleted]
    I've only played a couple hours (after demo) and uts easy so far - but it is still early game.

When I did the eikon challenge or whatever after beating the demo, the final boss was no pushover.

I had none of the easy mode accessories equipped, and I just beat her with 0 potions or buffs left. I did manage to do it in one shot but just by skin of my teeth
    Wait you can’t change difficulty????
        The game starts with one difficulty mode but you can add accessories that make certain mechanics easier or no effort. One accessory makes you auto dodge, another makes dodging a quick time event, and another makes combos just one button press. It's your choice to equip them or not. 

Once you beat the game, there is a higher difficulty mode and/or you can play areas of the game as stages and compete for high scores.
    But then you have Rectifygaming saying:

>The attention to detail is astounding, with every town, dungeon, and landscape exuding a distinct sense of place and history

So it's even more confusing.
        I'm sure there can be both spaces that are atmospheric and add to the worldbuilding while also not having the most compelling level design.

Sums up a fair bit of Dark Souls 2 well for me lol, a game I'm fond of, in spite or, or perhaps in part due to its flaws.
I am four hours in and just bored. The map so far is similar to Stranger of Paradise, pick a place to go do X thing then pick next area. Why? A game thats exclusive to PS5 cant have an open world? I swear this was the same issue with FF13 being linear but hopefully it opens up. The combat is amazing, the voice overs are whatever and the story in four hours did nothing to grab my interest. There's moments where they clearly want you to cheer, clap and be excited but it doesn't feels like I'm doing nothing. Arcade mode is something that should be unlocked in new game plus. Going to town to revisit an area to replay it or watch cutscenes is so jarring to me.
    > A game thats exclusive to PS5 cant have an open world?

It's a valid decision. IMO, most of the time open world design just pads playtime without adding much value to the experience.
    I myself am pretty disappointed because the story is nothing to write home about.
I'll be the odd voice out. I played the demo and thought it was good. Obviously well produced, good gameplay and all that.

But I don't get the extreme praise. It might be because I'm not into animes at all either, but so much in the presentation felt caricatured. Characters were all extremely handsome, the direction of the actors lacked subtlety, the UI was not great, the gameplay was extremely frequently interrupted by cut-scenes to the point I questioned why they even had me move ten feet.

Everything about it was extremely competently made, and I think the story itself and world building is great, but I could not get over the characters. The main character being 15 and having a fully grown adult voice. I just could not square the sort of gritty fantasy with the "anime" sort of elements.
    The main character is FIFTEEN?! From all the pictures and trailers I thought he was AT LEAST in his mid twenties lol
        In the prologue haha. The game takes place across many years (which I definitely like). Demo is a few hours and covers the prologue.
    It’s funny too because this is the least “anime” Final Fantasy game pretty much ever. I mean I loved it but if this was too much for you, steer clear of JRPGs in general.
        The combat is more anime than any other FF. That's 100% fine with me!
    Same here, but it's hard to criticise anything but the framerate online. It's fair to disregard any opinion online which seems badly formed, but mention anything negative about the game's problems and you're called out for just looking for something to be upset about. The CBU3 bias is definitely real.

I resigned myself to just not raining on others' parade. I'm glad people are looking forward to the game and I think most will enjoy it because of the things it does do well. But, speaking as someone with access to a review copy, there are definite flaws here that are at least fair to be mentioned, even should they not detract from the main experience.
        >  The CBU3 bias is definitely real.

yoshi-p fans are on another level with how they worship yoshi-p, defend CBU3 and anything they do :/ you'd get piled on for even daring to suggest this game might have some issues or you not liking some part of the demo. 

it's been funny seeing their reactions to this game not getting 10/10s (most of the high scores are 9/10s, only a few 10/10s) and the metacritic score being at 88 and opencritic score at 90, cause they were going off hyping it up as "instant 10/10 masterpiece! will easily reach metacritic score of Zelda, RE4 remake, etc"
        It really is insanely frustrating sometimes to be in this hobby due to some of the culture around it.

I’ve never seen another group of people who take the slightest criticism towards something they like as if it were a personal attack. And inb4 the “good criticism is fine but complaining is not.” No? This might apply if you’re a professional critic but as a consumer you have the complete right to complain.

I’ve been in this sphere forever but the way people have attached their identities and entire existence to revolve specific brands and products is the most depressing development ive seen as of late.
        I have to say I actually loved the demo and it got me excited for the game. But completely agree that the CBU3 bias is very obvious and has been in place for months. Even just suggesting you couldn't see what people were thinking was looking good about the game led to a pile-on.
    >The main character being 15 and having a fully grown adult voice

Eh, I pretty much had my fully grown voice by the time I was 15.
Its seems good but not the resurgence some were anticipating. For me it is a problem that the rpg aspects and exploration are the lows and the combat and story the highs. It seems it is an action game with rpgs elements.
>It's impossible to create a build and there's nothing important left for you to manage through the menus. Proper RPG options are gone, dungeons are just banal corridors, players are forced to play the entire game in easy mode and you can beat the game with literally no effort.

Welp, no hard mode on first playthrough might actually be a dealbreaker for me. FF7R and DMC5 also did this, and they bored me to tears, I need a bit of pushback to stay engaged. Scaled back RPG elements doesn't help. Crap
Heard we back up? 👀
Also: A remake of a Super Mario RPG was just announced for this year, we're in another golden age.
    And Super Mario Bros. Wonder!
    Jesus Christ, that is going to be glorious
And armored core 6 in august. I rented the original when I was super young, got my ass kicked and got lost in the intricacies of the customization. Now as a still shit at games adult I’m excited to give it another go
    I belieber in you
    Honestly, I forsee a lot of controversy surrounding the Armored Core release. With FromSoft's breakout success in the past decade a lot of fans are not familiar with their catalogue of older games. Armored Core is a pretty niche experience that is probably NOT going to be a big hit with most people. I think people buying it because of their love for the Soulsborne games are going to be in for a shock.
        I can definitely see there being people who will ultimately be pissed at what they get. The same thing happened when sekiro released. Idk if there’ll be *a lot* per say. 

At this point I think people that consider themselves part of the soulsborne community are probably so starved for new content that they’ve seen the gameplay vids for any new thing fromsoft puts out and have a baseline understanding for what to expect. 

But I could be way off. I know certain people were upset with elden ring being too different from dark souls and if that can happen, anything can.
It's not a bad year for all games tbh (Dead Space, Diablo 4, Jedi Survivor, Hogwarts Legacy...) but yeah Japanese devs are on fire for this first half of the year. Ironically, the latter half seems more stacked with Western devs big titles (except Armored Core 6 and probably Pikmin 4, we'll see in a few hours for that one)
    The end of the year is also packed with big releases. It's so much that I can't play all that I want to play.
        This is shaping up to be one of the best years in gaming ever.
            This is why I laugh every time I read people writing how gaming is dead or something. We see some of the best games released every year. This year is no exception.
                Some people just hyperfixate on the things they hate about gaming. I think it's just because hate is great for algorithmic content filters. So all they see is the worst stuff.

And maybe some of it is just the churn of people burning out. It's a hobby like any other and plenty of people get tired after a while.

Totally agree though, it's so packed that I'm skipping games I want to play because I just don't have the time ;-;
                    > I think it's just because hate is great for algorithmic content filters. So all they see is the worst stuff.

Half that, and half that the human brain is wired in such a way that negative experiences stick around more than positive ones. So its a bad feedback loop between the two all around.
            Absolutely. I thought the golden days of late 90s/2000s were over, but this year might be the best!
                The difference I think is largely in frequency. This is a great year. But how often we get great years seems spaced further out.
            2017 had Super Mario Odyssey, Zelda Breath of the Wild, Persona 5, Nier:Automata, Horizon Zero Dawn,  Resident Evil 7, Cuphead, Nioh, What Remains of Edith Finch, Wolfenstein II, Undertale, to name a few.
                undertale was 2015
                Let's not forget Prey!
                Undertale is older than that no? Great year though. I still need to go back and beat Nier
                This year is already beating 2017 for me personally
                How about 2020? New Horizons, Doom Eternal, Hades, Persona 5 Royal, FF7 Remake, TLOU2, Half-Life Alyx, Demon's Souls, Spider-Man Miles Morales, Microsoft Flight Simulator, Yakuza Like a Dragon, Ori and the Will of the Wisps, 13 Sentinels, Ghost of Tsushima, Genshin Impact, Cyberpunk (okay, it's debatable, but it has its fans), and more.
            I think we can safely say that it is. The best year for gaming since probably 2007 or 2008.
                2011 was good, no? (Skyrim, Arkham City, MW3, Dark Souls, Battlefield 3, Portal 2, Uncharted 3)
                    2017 as well
                        Yeah, 2017 was just an insane year.
                        [deleted]
                            [deleted]
                        Horizon: Zero Dawn, Nier: Automata and Persona 5 all within a few months of each other (in the west at least). 2017 was great
                            So was Breath of the Wild. Horizon has consistently come out at bad times. First game was a week before BotW. Second game came out a week before Elden Ring.
                                How could I miss BotW. Spring 2017 was on fire.
                    Kinda stops there though. The reason why this year is the best in awhile is because the games are good, they're mostly all beloved franchises, and there's just sooooooo many. The list of released games this year is enough to stand against 2007 for me, and we're only halfway through the year
                        Off the top of my head, 2007 had Halo 3, CoD 4, Mass Effect, Assassin's Creed, Rock Band, GH3, Bioshock, AND Orange Box. I'm sure there are more that I missed, but to me, it's still the GOAT year
                            [deleted]
                                Supreme Commander released in 2007 as well, incredible RTS
                            Burning Crusade, Crysis, Uncharted, STALKER, God of War 2, Metroid Prime 3, Super Mario Galaxy.

What a fantastic year. I started out with Burning Crusade in January, picked up Bioshock and Orange Box in the middle, and ended with Halo 3, Mass Effect, and CoD 4. That's my personal favorite year for sure.
                    Yeah, that was a great year too. But a lot of huge IPs started in 2007.
                    Forgot Deus Ex: Human Revolution, The Witcher 2 and LA Noire.

2010 was almost as good IMO: Mass Effect 2, Fallout New Vegas, Bad Company 2, AC: Brotherhood, Starcraft 2, BLOPS 1, NFS Hot Pursuit, Alan Wake. Was an absolutely insane two-year period
                It’s hard to picture a year more stacked than 2007, but this year definitely feels close.
                    1998 is pretty famous. You had Ocarina of Time, F-Zero X, Metal Gear Solid, Resident Evil 2, Sonic Adventure, Banjo-Kazooie, Spyro the Dragon, StarCraft, Pokemon Red and Blue (in North America), Half-Life, Grim Fandango, Thief, Baldur's Gate.

That year was insane.
                        it was doubly insane considering a lot of us were little kids for it.  I still miss when I could imagine wide worlds while playing things like Tomb Raider 2.  As an adult, I know there's "nothing there" but as a kid, you didn't know games had limitations, especially before the internet.

I miss impossible rumors like "every person you fight is an actual person somewhere playing too!" or "if you collect all 35 1/35 soldier, they come alive and kill Sephiroth before he stabs Aerith!"
                        Okay no, it’s definitely 1998 if that’s the case. That’s damn near unbeatable.
                            It actually gets better...  


OP missed:   
Mario Party, Rainbow Six, Xenogears, and Rogue Squadron among others.
                            1997 was better for me.

Diablo, Final Fantasy 7, Castlevania SOTN, Blood, MDK, Harvest Moon, Final Fantasy Tactics, Star Fox 64, GoldenEye 007, Oddworld, Fallout, Jedi Knight: Dark Forces 2, Age of Empires, Blade Runner, Quake 2 and Gran Tourismo.
                                1994 gets no love, but was pretty amazing as well.

Sonic the Hedgehog 3, X-COM: UFO Defense, Super Metroid, The Elder Scrolls: Arena, Final Fantasy VI, Magic Carpet, TIE Fighter, Earthworm Jim, The King of Fighters '94, EarthBound, The Need for Speed, Master of Magic, Mortal Kombat II, System Shock, Doom II, Sonic & Knuckles, Killer Instinct, Warcraft: Orcs & Humans, Donkey Kong Country, King's Quest VII: The Princeless Bride, Wing Commander III: Heart of the Tiger, Tekken, King's Field, Marathon, Heretic
            2017 had Super Mario Odyssey, Zelda Breath of the Wild, Persona 5, Nier:Automata, Horizon Zero Dawn,  Resident Evil 7, Cuphead, Nioh, What Remains of Edith Finch, Wolfenstein II, Undertale, to name a few.
        I managed more or less on the big releases (but I'm not interested in all of them to be fair), except TOTK reported to whenever I have the time. But I certainly not progressing on my backlog (in fact I'm adding to it lol)
        im still on PS4 and for the past few years ive felt perfectly comfortable with that and like i didnt need to upgrade anytime soon. within the past half year that’s completely been demolished and my backlog has absolutely ballooned up lol. its to the point where the longer i wait the bigger an investment the ps5 becomes because id want to buy like at least 5 $70 games right away
    Is Jedi Survivor fixed on PC yet though? Last time I tried it it was still incredibly broken. I really want to play it but also don't want to support games being released in that state.
        Nope, it ain't. Still broken and crashing on specific planets. Latest patch (like 2 days ago) had no mention of significant performance or stability improvements afaik
        I'd still wait to play it, if I were you. I've played it on PC and beat it, and while it's undoubtedly a fantastic game, the experience was definitely tarnished by the sluggish frame rate and stuttering in cut scenes.
    I don't think "not a bad year" describes a year with ToTK, ff16, Diablo 4, good remakes of 2 of the best horror games of all time, releases from all 3 big fighting franchises, and later this year spiderman 2, starfield, and armored core 6.
        Yeah it was an understatement. Also a new Mario 2D just announced, Pikmin 4, Baldur's Gate 3, AC Mirage, Alan Wake 2, Avatar Frontiers of Pandora, Cyberpunk 2077 revamp and expansion,...

I think like the devs have just collectively decided to all come in 2023. And weirdly we know almost nothing coming post-2023 except a few games lol.
In general, it's been a strong year for games.
    I don't think we've seen such a strong year for video games in a long time. This is definetly in the top 5 of video game years in terms of quality output.

If Elden Ring launched this year, it'd basically be unbeatable :O
        Zelda, Resident Evil 4, Jedi Survivor, Diablo 4, Starfield, Spider-Man 2, FF16, Mario RPG, Mario Wonder, Yakuza Gaiden, Honkai Star Rail, Dead Space, Alan Wake 2, Gollum.

What a year.
            You snuck that one in there didn't you
                Yeah Zelda barely squeezed in.
            You forgot Hogwarts Legacy and Baldurs Gate 3. Absolutely nutty year.
                I really enjoyed dead island 2. The video game equivalent of a really well executed B movie with great gore and visuals
        [removed]
Capgod renaissance
    They only need to drop a Monster Hunter World 2 trailer to achieve absolute and total dominance this year.
        Sunbreak is done with it's TU cycle...announcement probably isn't THAT far off now
            Tokyo Game Show in September! That's where Rise was revealed.
            It's almost guaranteed to be revealed at TGS, they straight up said to monster hunter fans "to look forward to TGS 2023"
            I suspect it might still be a while since it might seem too similar to Dragon’s Dogma 2. I was hopeful too but I think world 2 gets announced closer to DD2 release
    From Crapcom to Capgod in the span of a decade, what a ride
At first I thought Horizon (2022 ooops) would have been a great GOTY contender, then Tears of The Kingdom dropped and thought that was a shoe in for GOTY. Started playing SF6 and was having some of those "good ol days" moments not sure if a fighting game could win GOTY though. I'm enjoying my time with D4 and its a solid entry as well. The FFXVI absolutely blew me away, so I really have no idea what game is going to win this year.

Its been a great first half and we still got Baldurs Gate 3, Armored Core 6, Alan Wake 2, Spider-Man 2, MK1, Witchfire(EA?), Starfield, Remnants 2, Pikmin 4, Like a Dragon, Pay Day 3, Avatar, and Lies of P to look forward to.
    Yeah, this is gonna be one of those 'Was this one of the best years in gaming' years, I think, in discussions of the future.  I really didn't think things were going to keep getting -better- after Horizon.
        Wasn’t Horizon last year? Or are you talking about the Burning Shores DLC?
            To be fair, Burning Shores is a damned good DLC.
    >At first I thought Horizon would have been a great GOTY contender

Call of the Mountain? Because Forbidden West will be close to two years old by GOTY time.
        Man you're right. I only played it this year before Jedi Survivor* (My timeline is jacked up this morning) so thats why it was still fresh to me. lol.
they just announced super mario RPG is getting remade and out in november. so this is officially the best year in gaming of all time for me lol
Hi-Fi rush as well ;)
Japanese devs have been delivering hit after hit for the last years. Not only they're pretty commercially successful, but I feel they're the only ones making interesting AAAs. 

From Software and Nintendo have revolutionized the open world genre with Zelda and Elden Ring. And even old sagas are receiving more attention in the west, like the Yakuza series. Persona has made turn based rpgs cool again, FF is looking great. 

There was a time when people wondered if Japanese gaming was in a crisis, and now they're artistically on top while having strong sales.
    They're definitely not the only ones making interesting AAA games. They're good. But there's nothing \*interesting\* about RE4 REmake, for instance. It's just really damned good. There's nothing \*interesting\* about Street Fighter VI, it's just really damned good. I'll definitely give you Persona but that series has been oozing with style since 3. People are just finally catching on after 5. 

&#x200B;

I don't really like this narrative that "western devs" are creatively bankrupt when all the incentives structures to turn a profit on a game still exist in Japan. Japan has a diverse set of developers creating great games and so does "the west".
It's also genuinely is a great opening on its own in terms of narrative, akin to a larger act instead of a chapter of a story, in how it condenses the first couple of hours with having an established opening with introducing the characters, a middle-portion that explores the relationships of the characters, and a cathartic finale that ends on a suspenseful note. If the rest of the game has this kind of roller-coaster feel, then this is going to be an absolute big treat.
    I also liked reading all the backstory during cutscenes.
        One of the standout features for me so far and I hope other games start to implement it.
            It's great for people who might need to take a break from playing and come back in a couple weeks and not remember everything in the story. And it cuts down on boring exposition for everyone.
                It’s also great for folks like me that generally steer clear of high fantasy because of all the made up regions, names, supernatural elements, etc. sounding similar and being confusing. Such a great feature
    Its basically the pilot episode to the game
    For real. The fact that the context of the opening fight goes from "holy shit this is fucking awesome" to "holy shit nonono please make it stop" over the course of two hours is a serious testament to the narrative heft this game carries.
Sometimes you get demos that make you want to play a game like FF16, SF6, RE4, and sometimes you get demos that make you want to avoid them like Balan Wonderworld and Forspoken.
    I think it’s pretty wild that Square is publishing things with such discrepancies in quality. Talk about diversification.
        I'd say a large part of the quality of FF16 (and 14!)  is down to Yoshi-P and his team. The man knows exactly what direction he wants to take his games in down to the smallest detail and his team is phenomenal at executing that.

It also helps that he is high enough in the company where he can mostly tell other suits to screw off when they try to cram in NFT's or other similar garbage.
        That's just how publishers used to be, the difference is that now big publishers don't make games anymore.
It's so funny that big video game developers are rediscovering the concept of playable demos.

"Play the first chapter for free, pay for the rest" used to be *the* shareware concept.
    I get *why* publishers can be wary of demos because the last thing they want is something like the Forespoken demo to convince everyone not to get a game, but I can really pay dividends if the game is good. Like this, I've never had much interest in FF, but this one has been piquing my interest since it was revealed, and the demo totally sold me. 

Or another example, I played the shit out of the Mortal Kombat 9 demo after never playing a console fighter other than Smash, and now I'm a few months away from buying my 6th Netherrealm Studios game in MK1, all thanks to that demo.
        Demos work is you have confidence in the game.

I've been playing a number of impressive ones in Steam Next Fest (Little Kitty Big City is basically Stray but with more stuff to knock off ledges and humans to mess with) that I don't think would get any attention without the demo.

If your game is mediocre it can backfire, but if you have real confidence in the product it's a great way to build hype.
    Square Enix has always done demos for final fantasy though. I can’t think of one that didn’t. Even FF14 has a free trial that’s easily 60+ hours.
        It goes beyond Final Fantasy to Square Enix in general.

A lot of their games have had demos for years. All 3 Bravely Defaults, Forspoken, Triangle Strategy, both Octopaths, Dragon Quest 11, the new Valkyrie Profile, etc. Their collaborations with other studios (like Platinum for Nier Automata and Team Ninja for Strangers of Paradise) have also had demos.

DQ11’s demo in particular is one of the most generous demos I’ve ever seen. You get like the first 8 hours of the game.

At this point, it’s more surprising if a SE game *doesn’t* have a demo.
            By the time I hit the DQ11 demo stopping point I felt obligated to buy it cause I had so much time put in already lol
                It's funny since I had the exact opposite reaction. There was a time when I'd be all over that JRPG comfort food but playing the demo made me realise I've probably done it too many times, and I've moved on so it didn't make me want more (I stopped before the end). But I think overall it could only have helped them find more sales so it was still a good idea to release it.
            I wasn’t 100% confident as I could only definitely remember every FF game but you’re absolutely right. Square Enix has always had this practice.
Same here. I figured I’d try the demo and just wait for the game to come to PC, but after playing it I don’t want to wait anymore. My wife stopped playing her game to watch the demo and then had to stop watching at the end because of how emotional it made her.

We’re in for one hell of a ride.
    man, the end of the demo really made me feel uncomfortable, just brutal.
Right there with you. I've had Horizon Forbidden West ready to go for so long but just can't bring myself to start it. I made the mistake of playing a bunch of Assassin's creed games near the end of last year and I've been burnt ever since.

Everything I've touched since has been story driven or souls-like. Can't be more hyped for this FFXVI play-through. Nice to see a game just work it's strengths instead of shoving in shallow RPG systems to micro-manage or patterned open world gameplay loops.

>But dude, I am open world burnt out. I could go for a linear experience at this point.

No joke I started Horizon FW and just put it down after the prologue. I was so burned by Elden ring at that point...
It is extremely frustrating to me that comments like yours are such a common reply to criticisms about linearity. It's like nowadays gamers think there's only open world games on the one hand and completely linear games on the other.

You guys do know tons of non-open world games are not linear, right? There is a middle ground between open world and hallway level design.

Games like Dark Souls, Resident Evil, the recent God of War games, or the Metroidvania genre in general have interesting levels that offer satisfying exploration, without being open world.

Hallway levels are just awful, there is no excuse to ever have that in any AAA action RPG.

After about 8 hours of gameplay I can confirm most of what FF16 has is short, empty hallways. This is some of the worst "level design" (if you can even call it that) that I have ever experienced.

You might as well not let the player walk around and just have us go from cutscene to battle back to cutscene because there is really no point in being given control over your character when all you do is hold up for 15 seconds between battles.

There is absolutely zero exploration, let alone meaningful exploration to be found here.

I'm not asking for an open world, but just give me something that might actually make me think Square Enix employs a level designer. The maps don't need to be big open massive spaces, just give us a tightly designed dungeon crawling experience with branching paths, shortcuts, looping level design, etc...

I'm not asking for Dark Souls levels either, just give me *something*.
Really hard to tell before playing it. Lots of "corridor" games are cool because they dress it up enough it doesn't feel as constrained as it actually is (FFX for me). Plenty don't go through the motions and it suffers for it (FF13, barring one notable exception).

It sounds like it leans more towards the former though, thank goodness.
It really depends how linear it is. I loved the linear nature of FF10 and it is still my favorite FF. The way they did the linearity is a big part why. But if they are paths only from A to B (like the demo) with not exciting loot to incite exploring than it will feel bad.

I'm already salty for FF to follow the path of Action RPGs and throwing away the turn based combat. If they now decide to also delete the RPG from it then i'm done with the series.
Agreed. I love open world games but they can be exhausting. And sometimes I'm not up to start one cause everything is so vast.
There are games that could have won on some slower years, that won’t even get nominated this year. Pretty crazy honestly.
    Dragon Age Inquisition and Shadow of Mordor fought for most GOTY picks in 2014. I don't know if a game equivalent in quality this year makes the top 10 of *already released* games, without even thinking about what's to come in the second half of the year.
        We're really coming out of the Covid Lull when it comes to gaming.  It takes two won GotY in 2021, could you imagine that happening today?
            Honestly still surprised It Takes Two won over: 

* Deathloop
* Metroid Dread
* Psychonauts 2
* PS5 Ratchet & Clank
* Resident Evil 8
* Returnal

ITT wasn't even the best reviewed game of that year and yet somehow won GotY.
                Reviewers liked it but the player base LOVED it. It probably deserved to win
                Returnal should have won imo.
                Other than Metroid Dread, I think the rest were like 8/10 games... I think that was a pretty weak year tbh
        I think Dragon age Inquisition is really fantastic and definitely one of the biggest RPG of the last decade, i would absolutely put in very high among the best games of the year even if it relesed today.
        Those two games fighting for GOTY in 2014 indicates just how pathetically weak 2014 was.
            2014 had Bayonetta 2, Mario Kart 8, Shovel Knight, Divinity Original Sin, Dark Souls 2, Smash 3DS/Wii U, and Alien Isolation too

It wasn’t a great year in the grand scheme of things, but there were games to be played for sure
            Inquisition was great though. It's by far the most lore dense entry in the series. 

There were certainly some missteps (timed war table, the first area being garbage) but it was a great game as long as you weren't expecting Origins 2.
                I found Inquisition painfully mediocre in every way. Everything it did, Witcher 3 did a million times better a year later.
    That’s Hi-Fi Rush for me. I thought it could at least get nominated for a GOTY award but there’s like no chance now. Still really happy with the game though.
        Hi-Fi Rush is *brilliant*, and it would absolutely be a top contender in a year that wasn't as wildly packed as this one.
        I mean, it seems like the Game Awards usually have at least one indie game nominated for GOTY each year, so I’m still hoping for Hi-Fi Rush to be there. I just want to hear the orchestra play one of its songs during the medley they always do, lol.
            Hi-Fi is not an indie, it was developed by Tango Gameworks who are a Zenimax studio.

Definitely a smaller budget title (that is incredible) but they are not an indie studio.

But yeh with you, would love to hear a medley of songs from Hi-Fi, that would be fucking awesome lmao
    for sure. most years only have like 3 real contenders. all of 2021 wouldnt even be in consideration this year
We should switch to Game of the Month for 2023
    And for this past June we should probably switch to Game of the Week...
    Even that would be pretty hotly contested each month, lol.
2023 seems to be best year for gaming since 2017 which was the best year for gaming since 2011. 

Maybe the secret to a great year for gaming is the release of a new 3D Zelda.
    Imagine if Elden Ring came out a year later than it's release date amongst all this.
    We just need the new 3d Mario game to drop during holidays and it’ll basically be 2017 part 2
        Well, not 3D, but still a great looking Mario game is coming out later on this year.
            Super Mario Bros. Wonder **AND** the most unexpected thing, a 3D Remake of Super Mario RPG.  My jaw dropped.
            I just saw those, 2023 is a certified classic
Really feels like all the COVID impacted titles are finally spilling over the dam all at once.
And we don't even have Spiderman, Mario, Alan Wake, Starfield etc... yet. What a bonkers year for games!
I can't remember a year that stacked since a long time (2020 was pretty good but like all the year is equivalent to 6 months of 2023). And it's only half of it with tons of great hits to come (presumably).

2023 will reach 2007 levels probably (though while 2007 gave birth to many iconic franchises of gaming like Mass Effect, Uncharted, Bioshock..., this is mostly returning franchises now)
    I legitimately cannot remember the last time there were so many huge games in a single year, but so many of these have come out just *2 months* from one another.  In terms of critically acclaimed releases in a single year, I think 2023 may be the biggest year in gaming.  And we are only half way done with it.
        The late August/September timeframe is just crazy. Less than a month and Armored Core 6, Baldur's Gate 3, Mortal Kombat 1, Starfield and Phantom Liberty (which might as well be a full new game considering the extent of the changes it seems) are dropping. And that's just big games, there are also indies and smaller ones I probably forgot.
        Guys, just look at 2017, it's not so long ago.
Armored Core coming in hot in 2 months as well.
Really surprised to hear this (3rd comment I've seen about it and reviews lauding them) about side quests.

I read earlier before the embargo there were like 80 something so I prepared for them to be shallow and cookie cutter since there were so many.

Really happy that doesn't appear to be the case
    Now, without spoiling anything, the first 10 you do are pretty bad and generic, but it does get better when you advance in the story. I've done roughly 30-35? and I'd say 20 of them are what I consider good.
        Honestly a few mediocre side quests is what I expect even in games with the best side quests (even Witcher 3 had its share weak ones). As long as the ratio isn’t too stilted towards the mediocre then the high points of the good quests will outweigh any negatives.
            Yeah, and honestly a few beans quests are actually good for the game in the long run I think. Makes the really good one stand out over the 'meh' ones.
Can I ask you a weird one? How easy is it to tell what the hell is going on in combat? I’ve noticed that with this style of game, where everything is over the top flashy, it can be very hard to read what’s going on vs your Souls games, or Horizon or something. And in a game that wants you dodge and parry with precision, that’s a problem. 

Also, when you say “combos”, are you talking about memorizing 8-button (or more) strings that have to be pressed rhythmically? I’ve never been good at those? 

Thanks.
Disappointing about the Eikon fights. I was hoping that player agency wasn't going to be paper thin, but here we are. I guess how else would you do it right?
    Definitely spectacle over renowned combat. You're essentially Godzilla fighting things larger or as big as you. If that sounds fun to you you'll definitely enjoy it. The ones I've done are all different in their own ways so please don't mistake my description, but its 100% for the awe and not the engaging combat some might expect.
> and I'm about 40% through I believe

How many hours of gametime to reach 40%?
    I’m about 20 hours in!
My main concern is that enemies could feel quite spongy. And they often seem to have super armour outside the stagger mechanic . 

Does this get better over time? Or can fights drag on a bit?
    So I've personally found all enemies pair with your level, so if you felt that way with the demo enemy fodder (we're talking seperate from the mini boss battles like the dragoon) then I can say they will feel a bit spongy. 

I think thats why the combat is how it is. It forces you to combo and not just mash the attack button. If I just do that they do feel spongy, if I get huge combos by using eikon attacks + jumping and swerving that spongyness is still there but is drastically reduced. Does that make sense?
        I guess my worry was if they don’t flinch much. Do you get time to pull off combos?
            Very much. Obviously theres stagger, but if you pull big combos even when they're not staggered, they can't really do anything until you're done them lol. Very empowering if you can master them.

    Im pretty avid in action RPGs, so I do believe if you're like me you would find this easy. For reference I've yet to die. + I do not use the necklaces that provide some handicaps for gameplay. 

I was debating just trying to get the New Game+ as fast as possible so I can be challenged, but decided not too and I'm just enjoying the ride. I hear that that mode is the challenge mode.

I'd say its in the middle of Final Fantasy VII Remake normal mode and hard mode.
What are the towns/cities like?
    Lively in terms of how many NPCs are around (much more than VII Remake Sector's) but don't expect Novigrad. If you played Horizon Zero Dawn, its like Meridian. Lots of talking (not to you) but going about their business.

I've been to two major cities. The towns are much smaller but still populated.
Right?! 2023 is going down in history
    Reddit hates it, but shit, diablo released between the two and the reviews were great too.
        Which is funny because I think Diablo is probably the best Western (as in not Japanese) game so far this year with Jedi close second.
Once done with that. End august you can play baldurs gate 3, another huge game which will end up being the actual best game of the year obviously.
From a French youtuber i follow, he said that the side quest were mostly MMO-tier very barebones ones but some of them stands out by , i quote" trying very hard to be like The Witcher 3". So apparently there is some really good quests inside a lot of forgettable ones.
I heard the side quest only get interesting halfway through, that was from ign review so perhaps there is truth from both reviewers?
You can still have a story that fleshes out multiple characters but ultimately it can still be the story of one person and his journey.
The sidequests can be both at once. Mechanically a bit eh but with good dialog and story. 

The first few I did were just fetch quests. However, they did a lot to flesh out how the people felt about being where they were.
It seems they have traded that for mechanical complexity in the combat. It's not quite DMC or Bayoneta level of course, but compared to your average Character Action game it seems to have more going on for combo building.
    The combat was actually designed by the dude who did DMC 5 combat
        *One* of the guys who did DMC 5. Ryota Suzuki also worked on Dragon’s Dogma and Marvel Vs Capcom 2.
Are the levels truly more linear, or do they just not put as much effort into making it feel non-linear? Because most FF games are actually pretty on-rails for the majority of the game, even if you feel like you can explore a world map.

FF7 was completely linear until you found Cid's plane for example.
    That's true, but it did give players some different options/experiences by the time you get Cid's plane, even if relatively minor.

Wall Market, how you played through Shinra Tower, the Phoenix thing, exploring the Golden Saucer, and getting Yuffie and/or Vincent all had the potential to give players different experiences by the time you get the plane and the map opens up a bit.
        I played FF7 my whole childhood and atleast for young me I felt completely free and even lost at so many times. At 8 years old I didn't have the gamesense to see where they were trying to lead me I suppose. All in all it took me 5-6 years to beat it (6/7yo to 12yo)
    FF7 gave you the illusion of freedom while heavily guiding you around especially with the mode of transportation. Still, you could always do extra stuff or skip it - so more like a Metroidvania nowadays. For a 90's game, it was pretty open.
    FF16's levels, at least in the first 8 hours, are literal hallways.

It's not about story progression being linear. That's fine. It's that the spaces you ""explore"" are literal straight lines 95% of the time.

Short, straight, empty hallways. You hold up for 15 seconds, then you get a battle, then up for 15 seconds, then a cutscene, then a battle, then up for 15 seconds, rinse and repeat ad nauseam. 

What little loot there is is basically just potions and crafting materials, and Clive automatically hoovers them up just by walking within 10 feet of them.

Oh, and they even give you a dog who will "show you the way", you know, in case you get lost in the tiny hallway that literally only gives you one way to go.

It's just unbearably hand-holdy and braindead. You might as well not give the player control to walk around if that's how it's going to be. Just have us go from cutscene to battle to cutscene to battle, cause that's all it is anyway. No need to let us explore when there's nothing to explore. It's pointless. 

And there is simply no comparison with the older games. Sure you had linear story progression for the most part, but the spaces you explored were not straight lines.

I replayed FF9 just a couple years ago, and that game has actual level design. It's not gonna blow your mind like a Dark Souls level, but the spaces you explore are not hallways. 

FF16 right now is almost making me think CBU3 do not employ any level designers.
> The big drawback that I am seeing in these reviews is that the game has shaved off much of the franchise’s deeper RPG systems, and the RPG aspect of this game is pretty shallow compared to previous titles

I like Final Fantasy but I think that it have never really had that deep RPG systems compared to many other in the genre, both compared to the west and Japan.
    They have, the games are just usually just really easy so the complexity is in how broken you can get it to be (Except for like the one or two optional super hard bosses every game).

Same as pokemon, it can be pretty interesting mechanically but main story is brain dead easy.
Ehhh Final Fantasy was never that deep to begin with tbh. 

Like , unless i missing something most games you can just Power level anything. 

The most ''in-depth'' FF that i tried out was 12 Zodiac Edition with the job system and gambits.
    I don't know if "depth" would be the right descriptor, but FF7's materia system could lead to some pretty wacky character builds, along with FF8's junction system.
        Which is a bit of a double edged sword.  One weakness of FFVII is all the characters feel very samey because of the materia system.  That's fixed in FFVII Remake though
        the depth of the combat system will probably not be fully explored by most critics
            Probably because the game also doesn't demand that from the player.
                I just beat FF8 again last year. I kid you not I didn't use an ability outside of attack or limit break for the first 30 hours.
                    Yeah FF8 has the air of complexity but it's incredibly basic and none of it is at all necessary to complete the game.
                        FF8 is legit my all time favourite game, but once you figure out how to cure-refine tents into curaga on disc 1 it is over.
                            Nah, getting Curagas from tents is nice, but the thing that breaks the game is realizing that Abyss Worm cards refine into Windmills which refine into Tornadoes.  Those will give you OP strength until the mid-game and by the mid-game you can easily get more upgrades.

Not to mention Disc 1 Lionheart, and general limit break spam.
                    Yea, you just spam Aura on Squall and Renzokuken your way from disk 1 to the end of disk 4.
                        Haha yeah aura is that one non-limit break ability you cast...because it lets you cast more limits. Occasionally haste too. Ya know. More limits faster. Love the game but it feels like they literally never even gave it a single balancing pass.
        Those (and I'd add FFX and the MMOs to that list) are more the exception, honestly... It's really what makes "JRPG" different than "RPG".

Look at FFIX, for example. A wonderful, virtually perfect game, but it has very little in the way of RPG systems. In a lot of numbered FFs, pretty much the only choices that change anything are which party members you choose to bring along. (By the way, the right answer is Quina.)
        While I agree with them that FF series and JRPG's in general never really have what I would call depth in terms of the RPG systems, I replayed FF7 about a year or two ago and there's a certain satisfaction that comes from how absolutely broken you can make Tifa by putting her in the backline with Long Range materia and always making sure she has Sadness, then mixing in counter/cover/X4 attack with Powersoul and Curse Ring and giving her Odin linked with Added Effect. I can't remember my exact materia/gear setup but by the end of the game she was just demolishing everything in a turn or two.
    7's materia system and even 8's junk system had some depth I'd say. Especially 7 had some absolute ridiculous combinations if you could figure (and, well, grind) them out.
        I'm a huge FF7 fan, but that game is pretty easy. It was basically the JRPG tutorial (along with Pokémon Red and Blue) for a lot of us. Materia combos can be absurd, though.
            I don't know how adult me would feel about them, but back in the day I wouldn't say the optional bosses were that easy. Of course if you look up online where to find the best weapons, limit breaks and materia you can make them fairly trivial, but I'm talking about just playing the game blind.
                That's for sure. You can cheese basically any encounter if you look it up. I do recall child me struggling with the weapons.
                The optional bosses were the only parts that had any incentive on actually using the systems, but they were also designed around selling you the Ultimania guides, that was SquareSoft's MTX back in the day, so they were basically never fair but hard, just hard with almost no way of truly figuring them out without the guide
                    Fighting Emerald with no knowledge of materia for Underwater breathing.
    You could literally change most characters and the job system is a hallmark of the series
I mean it's not like JRPGs are always particularly deep mechanics wise and neither has FF as a franchise been. The series only got mechanically more "complicated" with the job system in FF3 where something other than just "equip best gear and accessories"  got introduced. FF6 has the magicite which boggled down to "equip on everyone until they get their magic and then swap around". FF7 and FF8 went a bit more complicated as the materia system essentially allowed everyone to do everything, the GF system was similar to magicite in 8 but you couldn't permanently keep the abilities. FF9 was pretty much just "make sure everyone learns all abilities from the items" and only FF10 went far enough where you could actually cripple your characters with the advanced sphere grid. Outside of that it's generally been nothing more than "equip your best items and a ribbon if you got one".
    The job system got much better from FF1->FF3->FF5->Bravely Default, so that was progress there. Being able to combine parts of different jobs in FF5 and even moreso in BD added a lot of depth imo.
    I agree. Chrono Trigger is loved by many JRPG fans and its a very short and mechanically shallow game.
        It was 1995 on SNES, at the time the game was fairly robust in mechanics for a console game. Characters with abilities that interacted with each other was pretty exciting back then. Plus the several minigames (millennial fair, bike chase, etc) and for RPGs it set a standard for sure.

Now, yeah, it's extremely basic but it does the things it does very well. Which is hard for most new JRPGs to achieve.
            Oh I agree. I’m just saying JRPGs dont need crazy mechanical depth to be enjoyable. I like CT as much now as I did then. The game is just a vehicle for the story
FF15's RPG aspects were pretty shallow as well. It's unfortunate but they just seem to view the series as an action series now. From what I've seen (and played) the rest of the game more than makes up for it.

That said love to see the mainline series try turn based again (or atb) with games like Persona and Dragon Quest's mainstream western popularity proving there's still a market for that.
    To be honest, I have never considered FF's RPG aspects to be that deep at all.

For most games, you equip a weapon, you have a skill book and you equip an armor piece, an amulet or a trinket, a ring and that's it.
    They're "overhauling" Dragon Quest's combat system for the next mainline entry. It might end up not being a turn-based game either.
    FF15 was a unfinished game with a seemingly unfocused idea of what they wanted their action combat to be. FF7 remake improved on that, and it seems FF16 improved and mayhaps perfect it.
        FF7 remake was weirdly not much of an action game. Or it was one with a lot of menu usage. It was weird. But it's probably as close to another ATB game as we'll get
> The levels are more linear as well.

This has raised my interest in the game. I'm so burnt out from open worlds.
>the game has shaved off much of the franchise’s deeper RPG systems

To be fair, most of these were shaved off in FF13 and 15. Based on what I played of the demo, this game seems to be re-adding some complexity. Certainly an abundance of potential complexity with the combat.
Yeah the gameplay sounds amazing in combat,  but exploration seems to not really be as rewarding as past games. The demo performance didn’t really bother me, so I’m not worried about that and will probably play in quality mode regardless. Side quests sounded like more of a mixed bag to me though, and this description makes it sound pretty similar to FF7Rs which aren’t my favorite.

> Sidequests especially strike out on that front, delivering dull content that seems uncharacteristically weak for a team that’s responsible for the beloved Final Fantasy XIV. The glut of side stories here are as by the books as they come, repeating the same few mission structures that herd Clive from NPC to NPC. Close to a dozen of the sidequests simply ask me to talk to someone, speak to three NPCs stiffly standing around a town, and then go back to the quest-giver for more lore. Others have me fast-traveling somewhere to fight a battle that’s sometimes over in as little as 30 seconds before throwing me into another lengthy chat. Rinse, repeat

EDIT: the IGN review makes it sound like they get better by the end of the game at least:

>They actually start out pretty generic and menial, with objectives like finding X number of Y items out in the field, or delivering three hot bowls of soup to people in the hideout. However, in the back half of the story, these sidequests act as smart ways to button up all of the loose threads outside of the main campaign
Sounds like the demo did a good job in that case
“Changes in the story”? Would you mind expanding on what you mean by that?
    I watched the video and I think he meant as a its a more adult story than previous ff games which primarily focuses on one person rather than the party of players in other games which he prefers.
        The more mature story is one of the bigger hooks for me that sealed the deal.

Based on the demo and combat/gameplay I would have almost certainly gotten it anyway, but I personally prefer more adult/mature stories and a more 'kiddie' one would have poured some water on the entire thing for me.
            Yeah. The general tone of FF games prior kept me away from them. I played the NES and SNES ones as a kid, but never got much into anything after VI except Tactics. Seeing a trailer for the story then playing the demo had be very interested. I was just waiting for reviews to see if that tone and quality carried on for the full game and now I'm waiting for this pre-order download.
                If you love tactics then you'll love this. The devs pretty much worship FFT with XIV having a whole mini arc with the characters and locations. I expect XVI will be the same.

Fun fact: The main characters kingdom Rozaria is a reference to the offscreen rival kingdom in FFT.
        I see that as an absolute positive for me. Give me the demo tone over a full game and it'll be one of my favourite games.
            This is indeed what you get basically.
                Nice 👍
        The story kinda gives me an FF Tactics vibe tbh, which also primarily focuses on the protagonist's life. It's also very dark with a heavy political-theme.
        Is that true though?  FFVI never really had a primary protagonist and it's one of the greats
            That's what they're saying - this game focuses on the primary protagonist while most previous FF games split the story focus among the party.
                Wow, I completely misread that, thought you were saying the opposite 😅
        This too and ya it is WAY more mature and it has to be. The stuff dealt with and talked about. It would have felt weird if they were like "silly darn Susan burned the muffins"
    I think he meant changes in tone. Tonally it's more mature than previous entries

            FFXIV at its core is still a light hearted game though. I haven’t played or even looked much at FFXVI, but it may be that it’s gritty and dark all the time which would be a change of pace for this series.
                read that there were plenty of lighthearted moments in one review
            and then they go and (EW Spoilers) >!Goomba stomp a kid in front of his dad right on screen. God that entire Final Days section was just brutal!<
        Some previous entries were pretty dark story-wise too, to be fair. FF6 for sure. You could probably argue FF7 as well.
            Honestly this is pretty much in line with most of the Ivalice world games. I know they rarely show up in the mainline titles, but a lot of the narrative feels very comparable to FF Tactics or Vagrant Story.
    More like story delivery style. I edited it. Its just very, very different in that way. It took a bit of getting accustomed to.
        Hmm interesting so it's not just gameplay->cutscene->gameplay repeat?
            > That to, at times. But more about, *I am worried about spoilers here sorry and we can't say a ton*, but the timeline changes and back and forth and who has done what where and what MIGHT be a cutscene turns into gameplay an stuff like that.
Cant dive into it much more than that.
                At the very least it sounds like an interesting approach
                    It is for sure. I liked the slightly Game of thrones darker tones.

Seconding another reply- I’m curious what you mean by “changes in the story.”
    The core focuses tighter than many games before, the mature themes I discuss in the video, and how they are acted. Which I liked. But I can see people sort of thinking...weird. The first time some of the bits occur, or they watch a cutscene.
    I think what he meant changes in the story is that this final fantasy has a more mature story than others.
Torgal is enough for me, also the writing, i love a game with a good amount of fucks
Sounds like this review would be different if the game wasn't titled Final Fantasy.
I knew Torgal was good for at least +2 score out of 10 the second I saw him! Good boy.
Changes in the story? Like from what we saw in the demo?  Or changes from like the traditional FF trope?
You mentioned in your review that it's not your favourite Final Fantasy by a long shot. Please can I ask which is, and where would you place XVI in the hierarchy?
The last time a mainline, new Final Fantasy game pulled above a 90 on Metacritic was with FFXII, way back in 2006.
    And even that's wild given how utterly divisive FF12 was
        12 was divisive because the world wasn't ready for it yet. Mechanically and world wise its one of if not the best FF game. The gambit system was years ahead of the competition and is something a lot of games could benefit from. Its the only game where I am genuinely excited to see how the AI will handle a situation. Its a game where every new location is a joy to explore and years later people are still discussing party compositions due to how well balanced and expressive the job system in that game is.

Yes it has flaws like its story not being finished or the early game being a mess with you having to buy Gambits but even with those flaws its a brilliant game and one of the best FF games.
            > 12 was divisive because the world wasn't ready for it yet.

Hi, its me, I'm the problem its me. Granted I was like 14 when it released, I hated the mechanics. It wasn't until revisiting it a few years ago that I truly appreciated it.
            FFXII suffered by making Vaan the main character, for good reason. God he was annoying.

Also the gambit system would be niche today, it wasn't just ahead of its time, it straight up will never be for everyone, and that's okay.  Personally it is my least favourite battle system in the franchise besides 15s half-assed action approach. For perspective, my favourite is VII-Rs system, followed by X and XIII. I don't have issues with ATB either.

And like you said, the early game is so messy that it turns a lot of people off.
                Vaan and Penelo were garbage characters and dragged down the experience and the story. The ending was also half-baked.

I personally loved the gambit system but can see why it's not for everyone.
                    You can tell the developer was afraid of having an older character as the main character for a final fantasy, so they created Vaan who is pretty unimportant to the story.
            Final Fantasy XII was the first FF game I played and the most appealing to me. I was extremely disappointed when the 13th part was not even close in gameplay to the previous game.
                I still love FF13’s combat system. It takes way too long to unlock Paradigms but once you do it becomes an extremely engaging balancing act. Shame about the level design though.
        12 was the first of the mainline games I didn't enjoy and I still don't understand the appeal.

The narrative is the least interesting of all the Final Fantasy games I've played. It starts off promising and the character designs are amazing, but it just doesn't quite gel. When I learned years later that the original creator's vision was compromised by Square it made so much sense. All the pieces were there, but he wasn't given creative freedom to execute it the way he wanted.

And people rail on FFXIII for it's linear corridor exploring, but FFXII was the exact same and no one seems to mind. At least FFXIII had a solid narrative with characters that all made sense.
    Can we count shadowbringers and endwalker, they are basically new games with the size of the average 14 expansion
        MMO expansions get even more skewed from bias than regular releases, since only the dedicated are playing them in the first place
            and you have to be *hella dedicated* to get through ARR tbh

Took me 5 tries over years before finally sticking with it.
                Yeah I've tried twice now. Never make it past level 20 or so. Really wanna get to the "great stories" later on but I literally am falling asleep when I try to play through ARR X_X
    > The last time a mainline, new Final Fantasy game pulled above a 90 on Metacritic was with FFXII

FF16 is sitting at 88 on metacritic: https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-5/final-fantasy-xvi

it never went above 90 on metacritic, was just on opencritic it did. 

90 now on opencritic: https://opencritic.com/game/14516/final-fantasy-xvi
    It's down to 88 on Metacritic which is what FF7R got. I don't understand why, I was banking on a 93 on open critic and I thought that was perhaps a little conservative (I did not want to entertain a 95 or higher despite how high quality the game seemed) but 88 on Metacritic and now down to 90 on Open Critic is beyond even my conservative estimate. A lot of the 70 reviews are complaining about the shallow RPG mechanics, simple combat (bullet sponge enemies that don't require much other than mindless burning of their healthbars), side quests or "overambitious"main story that fails to piece things together. Seems a wee bit more divisive than I expected. What a shame, I was thinking this game would embarrass 7R.
Down to 88 by now.

    i definitely did not appreciate it at the time but holy shit it really is the best bro trip game in the series.
    My favorite FF, damn sphere grid is so oddly satisfying.
Hoo boy, if you want a game that makes you feel like you're close friends with the characters, then Persona 4 Golden may possibly be for you!

Final Fantasy XV is also the only other game besides the Persona games that made me feel like that.
I’m on your side. There were a lot of things that were kinda mediocre about 15, but the characters were well realized and I easily got attached. The campfire scene at the end had me in tears. FFX is the only other FF to make me so attached to the characters.
That's one of FF15's goals and it did it really really well. It always struck me as lame when people criticize the game but completely missed or ignored what it did well. There is true history with your party because they're not colleagues or randoms you picked up to do a task. They're childhood friends and it shows in the narrative, characterization, and game mechanics/
I genuinely loved Noctis and the bros and it's why I put so many hours into that game, the party chemistry was so great. It reminded me a lot of old Bioware games where I would walk around just to hear what people were going to say.
ff15’s party dynamic was definitely a strong point
FF15 does some things incredibly well and other things incredibly poorly; whether people like it comes down to whether they think the good parts are enough to outweigh the bad.

The party characters are the perfect example of this. I've still yet to play another game where the ai companions were anywhere near as good as in FF15. They actually feel like friends, and have an insane amount of dialogue for the overworld.

Unfortunately most of that is missed if you don't spend a ton of time in side quests, hearing all of their dialogue and reactions to different things, and FF15 has absolutely awful sidequests.
It doesn't match XV in that (which was the first FF to have the entire party already be established BFFs, which helps with the chemistry) but it's still good. I definitely feel like there are character's I feel invested in. Cid and Jill are both solid characters as well.
> One thing it did for me though, more so then any game has ever done, was it got me really attached to my party. The game just did an absolutely amazing job of really making the player feel as if they were in this group of friends. I felt the comradery throughout the entire game. When the game ended I genuinely felt sad for a few minutes as it felt like I was leaving my friends.

You *must* play the Persona games. PS5 Royal is the most modern one and a great game that delivers on this, but PS4 Golden might be the best example of friendship and camaraderie *ever*. So good in that particular area
If you end up enjoying FFXVI, I'd highly recommend FFVII Remake. While it's definitely more of a **J**RPG, it's got a pretty good story. Even if you don't know the original, it's still a very enjoyable game.
    It's in my backlog too. All the FF kind of are I guess but I actually own this one, just haven't got around to play it
        I love the FF games, but if you aren't a big fan of JRPGs, especially if you don't like turn based combat, then it might be hard to go back to the first 10 mainline games. Just know that every numbered mainline game is completely unrelated to the others. There is no overarching story from 1-15 leading into 16. There have been sequels, prequels, and spin-offs of some of them though. 

1-6 are pixel based classic games. With the pixel remasters, that's the easiest and most convenient way to play them all. They mostly are similar with different mechanics introduced in each. 

7, 8, and 9 were all PS1 era games each with HD remasters. 7 has the first 3D graphics of the series, and it looks rough, even with the HD remaster. They all run on the same engine and are often considered a trilogy of sorts, but still had no relation to each other. 

10 is the first one with voice acting and the graphics were a huge step up at the time. It has a direct sequel (10-2).

11 and 14 are literally MMOs that take hundreds of hours to get through (look up a recap of you'd like). They seem like good games, but not an MMO kinda guy. 

12 was decent but it was the first (single player) step away from turn based combat. It plays almost identically to the first Dragon Age if you happen to have played that. It has at least a spinoff

FF13 and it's 2 sequels are harder to play if you don't have a PS3 or Xbox with backwards compatibility (emulation may be possible). They're the only ones I haven't played enough to remember. I started 13, but it just didn't click for me at the time. If I remember right, they tried a more action based approach to a turn based combat. I want to give them a fair try, but haven't had the chance. 

15 was unique and more of a hack and slash type gameplay, with a very different style. I really enjoyed 15, but I know I'm in the minority there. 

If you play FF7 Remake I'd also **highly** recommend the prequel Crisis Core Reunion. I love it's story and it has some very interesting tie in with the remake and it's sequel.
Don‘t ask me, I‘m waiting for the Xbox port
    I don’t believe it’ll be ever coming to Xbox.
> Playable but not great framerate in performance mode (not clear if tested with the day 1 patch)

Digital Foundry just did a tech review that mentioned the day 1 patch not making much of a diffeerence in performance. Seems like it drops the resolution in battle though, which boosts the framerate to a stable 60fps.

I hope 40fps / VRR will be implemented in this game though, as that will likely solve a lot of peoples issues with 30fps.
>Open areas are empty and not very interesting to explore

>Boring fetch sidequests

>Some complaints about lack of RPG systems

Ah there's the FFXIV influence
    Yeah this is what I was expecting after XIV tbh.

Definitely not CBU3's forte.
        what you don't like having large pretty environments except restricted by the one narrow path the player is allowed to walk in? ff14 is abysmal at exploration, other games do it so much better
            14 is terrible for exploration but in the exact opposite direction 

Starting with HW and areas designed with flying in mind every single area is just a giant open bowl with absolutely nothing of value inside it
        [deleted]
            The story of the sidequests is usually good. The gameplay...is not.
> Open areas are empty and not very interesting to explore

oh hey, an homage to FF14
"Open areas are empty and not very interesting to explore"

Whelp they really did take alot of inspiration from FF14 didn't they
Important to note that the complaint about side quests seem to pertain mostly to the first half of the game, and the second half of the game has excellent side quests
    I heard the opposite, some say the game falls off the second half where even main quest starts to feel like sidequest.
        There seems to be a trend in the reviews that says the second half is much stronger but I don’t doubt that some people think otherwise
[deleted]
I felt that playing the demo, from both the 2 hours and the Eikon challenge part. The story was interesting, but the actual wandering around until you get to a new cutscene was super dull and generic.
FFXIII has more anime-ish style and plot. This one is "realistic medieval European", GoT inspired, so ofc it's better/s
The storytelling in 16 is much better. 13 had a really compelling story but I literally had to read it all through the logs to understand what was going on because the actual gameplay provided no clarity. Plus the game “opens up” a lot more a lot quicker.
I did find the demo pretty easy, but I have to wonder how much of this is because of how much souls games have warped the difficulty curve of the AAA space.
    all the complaints i've seen are pretty valid, the first playthrough on action mode is too easy for most of the mechanics to ever be used.

i always replay these games so i'm fine with it being moderately challenging while i'm focused on the story and then NG+ being wild, that sounds like a good middle ground. i guess they could make NG+ available from the start, but that would be a worse mode imo, since wouldn't have your full suite of tools.

i like how they're doin it!
    God of War 2018 let you start on GMGoW difficulty immediately and while it was frustrating at times that's what I signed up for and am happy it gave me the choice.
    It’s warped some people/groups to the point of brainrot unfortunately.
        It's called personal preference... I also want hard mode by default instead of needing to earn it
Depends on what you consider difficulty,at the start it's either with the accessories pre-equipped or without them.
The higher difficulty shouldn't be in locked after you finish the game. This is not a 5 hour long game. People that like challenges will get bored.
Yeah I’m about 15 hours in. The two options are “story heavy” or “ action heavy” which pretty much means mash one button for cool move or learn the combos. Idk been playing if I get hit once I gotta start the level over.
Most of his reviews are a 6/10. I think he's in the wrong job lol
    Bruh he rated The Callisto Protocol and Ghostwire: Tokyo higher than both FF16 and Crisis Core remake.
        Ghostwire Tokyo is higher than ff16? Now that's funny.
            Callisto is such a bad game lol. It’s like they modded one section of dead space and you keep redoing that spot 1000 times
            I absolutely love Ghostwire (I’ve 100%ed it twice) but even I think that sounds like quite the take based on the FF16 demo.
        We are in for a weird time where Tales of Arise has a better metacritic score than FFXVI

Reviews are a funny thing when looked at  from a distance
            Not that weird, Tales of Arise is superb.
                I first half of Tales of Arise is superb, the latter portions I found to be less so (not much less, but still less).
                >Tales of Arise is superb.

Is it? I thought it was average. Xenoblade 3 that came out not long after was far superior.
        That's just absurd. Calistos combat system was borderline broken from a fundamental level
    could be someone who subscribes to the notion that 5/10 means average and 6/10 is already a positive score. Similar to how YourMovieSucks rates movies.

It's not a bad system as it allows for a bit more nuance that the standard "10=great, 9=good, 8=mostly good, 7=disappointing, 6 and lowe = literal garbage" ranking used for video games.

There are some implications when it comes to actively swimming against the stream (like developers bonuses tied to metascore rankings) but at least in isolation it's not an inherently good or bad thing to use a different scale
        One problem with scoring that way is video games can go much lower than movies. Movie reviews don't generally have to deal with the movie crashing.
            I feel like most of the time technical issues are left out of the review score and instead are mentioned as a warning separate from it. I mean, look at the review scores of highly buggy (at lunch) games like cyberpunk, Witcher, Skyrim etc.

When a buggy game gets bad review scores then it's usually because the critics aren't a big fan of the game to begin with (forspoken, fallout 76 at launch etc)
    I wish most reviewers averaged scores in that range...
    [deleted]
These were his main issues:

Uneven story  
Disappointing character arcs  
Dull sidequests  
Shallow RPG systems

If you think these are important in an arpg and this game doesn't do well in them, then it makes sense to lower the score. The thing is, even the positive reviews mention at least half of this, they probably don't think it's as big of a problem.
I don't think he enjoys story driven games... So I'm not sure why the fuck he's playing final fantasy
    I suppose it can be useful for people who hate story driven games to see how someone who also hates story driven games reviews a game.
    It’s always good to have opinions from people who aren’t usually into them sort of games, if it was only FF fans or JRPG fans then the reviews would be incredible biased.
I actually think there's an oversaturation of 9/10 and 10/10 reviews in the gaming community. 10/10 loses meaning when so many games get that. 10/10 means literal perfection so it should not be thrown around casually.

6/10 is actually above average. Idk why the gaming community is so behind in terms of reviews. Movies and TV shows constantly get 5/10s and that's acceptable. Gaming community has a taboo it seems.
We are living in a world where the reviewers are too afraid to upset the publishers and get their game advance taken away. It's all bullshit.

100%. Ailments I'm kinda sad about but the lack of big, open world maps are dead to me. I'd rather have a linear story told well and a combat system that's fun.
    There is a middle ground between open world and hallway level design.

Games like Dark Souls, Resident Evil, the recent God of War games, or the Metroidvania genre in general have interesting levels that offer satisfying exploration, without being open world.

Hallway levels are just awful, there is no excuse to ever have that in any AAA action RPG.

If you look at some of the classic FF games, the story was linear but not the spaces you explored.

FF16 has short, empty hallways. I'm not asking for an open world, I just want the bare minimum effort put into level design so I can actually get a little bit of exploration in my video game.

They create these beautiful, fascinating environments, and you can't engage with them at all. You're on a guided tour. Look but don't touch.

You hold up for 15 seconds, then you get a battle, then a cutscene, then up for 15 seconds again, rinse and repeat.

At that point why even give us control to walk around at all? It's literally pointless, I don't need to be holding up for 15 seconds.

All this game has to offer is cutscenes and battles so they might as well just auto-load us into battle after each cutscene ends because there's really no reason to ever give you control to walk around.
If it’s anything like the demo the QTE moments are interspersed in the fights and only serve to stagger the enemy or do extra damage
    Or for phase transitions.
    I mean, the rest of that first eikon fight was just holding triangle and moving the cursor. It wasn't super in-depth or engaging. 

That being said, it was only the first one of these in the game so I assume they get more hands on and interesting as the game continues.
id rather they stay GOW QTEs tbh
    💯 they're spectacles that happen every once in a while. You can't make them complex with heavy mechanics that you gotta learn.
        Why not? Honest question.
            I don't think the Eikon battles are gonna happen often enough for you to be able to grasp a completely new and varied moveset.
            Probably because it's a waste of time and resource to develop a complex mechanics for something that you do for maybe 7 times in the whole game.
                Every fight will be different mechanically too IIRC
    Asura's Wrath was awesome and that's basically the whole game
        I liked how Metal Gear Rising did QTEs.
    Having JUST finished GoW (2018) yesterday... that last boss fight actually slapped, even though I usually dislike QTE's they made it look & feel great.
    Same.  I get easily frustrated by gimmick fights, so I'd rather just have those fights be a glorified interactive cutscenes and have the gameplay focus be on Clive.
    I don't think I've ever experienced a QTE event I wouldn't rather have just experienced as a cutscene where I could put the controller down and enjoy the spectacle instead of sitting on edge scanning for prompts.
Yeah this was a minor concern of mine as well. Overall I feel like it’s just going to be more of a small gripe than a genuine issue but it is still a bummer that they’re more “gimmicky” than anything
TBH, with how excellent the base combat is, it's easy to forgive and even appreciate some spectacle fluff. if it was all flash and no substance I'd call it a big knock against the game but obviously this isn't the case.
The demo eikon fight was worse than GOW QTE's honestly. It was just me moving the cursor to track the enemy and dodge with a button everytime he lunges at me, for like 5minutes. Either have it be a challenge to do these fights or just let me watch the cool animations that's not this repetitive. 

Very minor gripe in an otherwise great demo though.
I guess I'm confused what you specifically felt made this review worse then others?

It was pretty positive about the game overall, but basically "I play FF for the plot, but the plot wasn't interesting to me" seems to summarize their main issue with the game. Is that a problem? ~~Are reviewers not criticize the plot in video games?~~
    "I like this game therefore any reviewer who dislikes it is wrong"

The same people who complain that critic score doesn't mean anything nowadays are usually the same to screech whenever a publication gives an outlier score.
u folks are being way more dramatic than that review is
Polygon is more or less a college student newspaper with a focus on videogames.
    The whole rant about the slavery part is like:

this is why games writers don't go after complex subjects in their games, because people bitch about it but if they're not there; they'll bitch about that too. Can't win.
        > this is why games writers don't go after complex subjects in their games, because people bitch about it but if they're not there; they'll bitch about that too. Can't win.

Are we at the point where "slavery is bad" is considered a "complex subject"? If anything, I feel like it's the opposite of a complex issue, at least when you are just tackling the issue head on.
            You can't make slavery a complex at all subject because morally it's wrong and the moment you even try to justify it economically or culturally it's gonna be a PR shitshow.
        I wouldn't go that far. There's a school of thought that games are chill entertainment first, and if they don't dissect really complex and thorny social issues with nuance and care, that's ok. 

Then there's another school of thought which views games and movies as art forms on par with literature or more "serious" movies, and if they bring up a real world issue, they better damn well treat that issue with respect. 

Which reviews speak to you depend, IMO, on which school you subscribe to. I know I've seen movies before, where I look at the reviews and wonder whether critics have watched the same movie I have, simply because we had different ideas on how topics should be treated in films.
        Is slavery = bad really a complex topic, though? Like the criticism isn't "the game has slavery", it's that "MC realizing slavery is bad" is a very weak and tired plot hook. Whether you agree with that or not, I don't think you're characterizing it fairly; the problem Gita seems to have is that it discards interesting/complex topics for a simple slavery plot
            I don’t think its that outlandish for Clive to realize its wrong later in life. Dude grew up as a child soldier in a world where slavery is literally the only thing keeping these nations functioning.
                Well, there are two things here.

First, in-game, Clive is already visibly uncomfortable with slavery as a child and then literally sold into slavery. It may be hard to square this with a realize slavery is wrong plot, which Gita notes.

Second, the criticism isn't necessarily that the plot doesn't make sense, it's a criticism of the plot the writers chose. The game can justify an MC realizing slavery is wrong but the writers still had to decide that was the story they wanted to tell and Gita clearly finds that story pretty boring and tired.
                True, but it doesn't change the fact that "slavery is bad" isn't a complex topic to tackle. I get that in the world of FF16 that may be an incredible revelation, but in storytelling in general, that isn't some great narrative feat.
                    Who says it’s an incredible revelation? It comes in the first 3 hours of the game when Clive gets to the hideout.  It’s a 30 hour rpg.
                Not only that - he grew up as a son of the ruler (even if not chosed to be the Dominant), so his grew up as part of a royalty and not common folk. 

And even then, in the prologue he treats branded man just like any other person, so he has a kind heart
                A story having a good internal logic doesn't automatically make the story good, or make it not trite. It can both be true that Clive thinking slavery okay for a time makes sense for him and the world and the story of any character thinking slavery was okay is lame by the standards of today. Look at Avatar 1. That director puts his foot into the worldbuilding, it's kind of insane, and ~~people loved that movie~~ it made an equally insane amount of money. It's still FernGully. Or The Last Samurai. Or the older movies I can't remember.
                    [Dan Olson made a really good video about this that he calls the "Thermian Argument"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxV8gAGmbtk). Alternatively known as Watsonian perspective.
                        I'm a Folding Ideas fan but I've never seen this video. Thanks, this is everything I mean, and surely what Polygon's talking about.
            Clive grew up a spoiled lordling, it's not a far step.

Rich people live in bubbles, I think it's pretty accurate. 

I know it's a joke but 'what could a banana cost? 10 dollars?' comes to mind.
                It might make sense logically, but that doesn't make it any more interesting. "Privileged man realizes slavery bad" is a very well-worn arc that often comes off as dull and pointless unless the story has something new to say.

No idea how well it plays out in-game, haven't played it, but feeling it chose a tired premise and did nothing with it is valid criticism for a story-focused game.
            Eh most plot hooks can sound weak and like something that's been done countless times already if you try to summarise it in one sentence.

Don't misunderstand I'm not saying whether FF XVI story is great/bad because I obviously haven't played the game already. I'm only saying, just because the plot hook have been done already, doesn't make it bad. It's the execution that matters.

For example "A good man turns bad due to life circumstances" is something that's been done countless times before and sounds tiring as fuck, but that doesn't change the fact that Breaking Bad is one of the best shows of all time and Walt's slowly becoming more and more fucked up with each season is a joy to follow.
                Sure, the game could be great, and most reviews are super positive on the story. I’m more noting that the criticism from Polygon is very understandable and not absurd, especially since it doesn’t even affect the precious metascore. People having very different takes and tastes than others isn't always a sign of bad faith or whatever.
        Maybe they're complaining because they, uh, thought the game handled the subject poorly?

Dunno how the scenario of "you asked for this to be in the game, this game did it badly, and you're criticizing it for handling it badly? checkmate" unironically became a "gotcha" people use.
        Is that true tho? Maybe not in most mainstream games, but thats true for most pop culture in every form of entertainment and most media. It's mostly about applying to the lowest denominator and selling well. There's plenty of indies and AA games that go for more. Besides that, gamer's love to complain about things being "woke" online
        When you make a serious game with serious topics, you are going to have more criticism when you don't handle themes, topics, etc. well. That's just regular criticism.
How is it overdramatic? The developers clearly want players to engage with the story on a deep level because they’ve been tripping over their dicks for months trying to sell the idea of a “mature” Final Fantasy, and the Polygon reviewer did just that. It seems that, despite all of Yoshi-P’s promising, we’ve gotten your run-of-the-mill FF tale but with way more graphic violence and language with some sex thrown in there for good measure, and I’m not surprised at all that some people think it’s a waste.
Jesus, that’s a joke to give it the same score as Redfall. If you didn’t like FF16 then fair enough, but Redfall was basically a barely functional product. And the “barely functional” is very arguable
Don’t the rings help with skill issues but not really accessibility? If you’re vision impaired or hard of hearing, does the game offer options for those (basic examples are high contrast mode, visual indicators for audio cues, etc.).
    Yes for hard of hearing.
    I don't know about high contrast mode, but it does have an option to turn on a visual indicator for audio cues (and of course it has sub-titles).
Compare it to accessibility settings in Last of Us 2. This is why the rings received critisms when they were revealed to be the accessibility settings when accessibility settings are supposed to be so much more than just making the game easier.
Because Opencritic offers a direct to reddit export option and Metacritic doesn't. The template you see from every review thread here is from there.
u/Turbostrider27 not planning in adding metacritic? it has over 90 reviews compared to 60 reviews opencritic.
> There are no status effects or elemental strengths/weaknesses.

Oh, that sucks.
Aw, I can do without elemental weaknesses since it's never really been big in FF but lack of status effects is a bummer.
Each Final Fantasy is an independent entry.
People don't seem to like an honest opinion, jesus.
    Yep. You can't criticize shit these days without getting assblasted by fan boys.


The game is far from perfect. Very far. From performance, to pacing, to just not even feeling like a final fantasy game (not the turn based complaint). Exploration is meaningless. Shiny blue markers for items to get 2 Gil is a joke. I'm multiple hours into the game now and haven't found any real items. Inventory maxing out potions is dumb since the game let's you put it into easy mode anyway. Fighting a giant boss for 5 mins gives 60 xp, fighting 3 humans with 3 eiikon abilities in 5 seconds gives 30 xp. The ability system feels bad, you just spam cooldownd asap. 

It feels like they wanted to make a movie and then somewhere realized that they had to make a game as well and tacked that on. 


I paid my 70 bucks, so I'm going to grind it out, but it already feels like a chore instead of fun. They really missed the mark imo.
Well, story, music and combat are the most important elements in a game, so this sounds awesome.
    For this kind of game, definitely. It's not like the problems detract too much from the core, which is why I said most will probably enjoy it.
Racist biases? Where are you getting that from?

It's a choice the game makes, and if it was distracting enough to bother the reviewer then it bears mentioning. I certainly wouldn't agree with the characterization as "sinister" but it's not unreasonable to note that regions drawing heavily from non-white cultures are exclusively populated by white people.
You pulled this from a massive review that does talk about the actual game, though? 

I don't see what's wrong with pointing out these things. People are allowed to have differing opinions or level of caring about these topics. For this reviewer, it was important enough to them to take away from their enjoyment of the game, and that could be useful information for someone else too. And in my opinion it's something that people should be thinking about more often than they do. 

>By the way eurogamer does not have a single black employee.

It feels weird to make this argument while also attacking that paragraph from the article. Does diversity matter or not? 

Both things can be a problem at the same time. Also, I'm sure the reviewer has no say in the hiring process.
    > It feels weird to make this argument while also attacking that paragraph from the article. Does diversity matter or not?

In this instance it's rather clear the OP wants to highlight the hypocrisy.
What are the racist biases
I can never understand the American obsession with race and representation. I'm a Filipino, we never get this sort of stuff in media. Am I happy when there is? Sure, but I'm not going to play or watch something just because there's representation. I'm not gonna dock points from something if there isn't either.
    >the American obsession with race and representation

Tbf this wasn't even written by an American; it's a British writer in a publication literally called Eurogamer.
        Honestly, British is so Americanized at this point.
If it's like 12, I can see myself glazing over during any of those "sit around a table and talk about how Kingdom Fluxia is attacking the Kingdom of Luneri while allying with the disgraced Archduchy of Flenth\*" cutscenes.

&#x200B;

\*not actual names or plot points.
Coming from ffxiv it seems to me like they added "quiet moments" like in ffxiv, where characters will just sit around and enjoy each others company for a bit. I enjoy these scenes but it's definitely not for everyone.
    I can appreciate those scenes sometimes but I feel that they were way over done in Endwalker.
        Nod. Nod. Chest bump. Nod.
            No fist clench?
Yeah, [Jason Schreier has posted he's not a fan of the last third of the game.](https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1671893813915439104?s=20)

[Gene Park also found the ending disappointing overall.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2023/06/21/final-fantasy-xvi-16-review-video-game/)
I've only played a couple hours (after demo) and uts easy so far - but it is still early game.

When I did the eikon challenge or whatever after beating the demo, the final boss was no pushover.

I had none of the easy mode accessories equipped, and I just beat her with 0 potions or buffs left. I did manage to do it in one shot but just by skin of my teeth
Wait you can’t change difficulty????
    The game starts with one difficulty mode but you can add accessories that make certain mechanics easier or no effort. One accessory makes you auto dodge, another makes dodging a quick time event, and another makes combos just one button press. It's your choice to equip them or not. 

Once you beat the game, there is a higher difficulty mode and/or you can play areas of the game as stages and compete for high scores.
But then you have Rectifygaming saying:

>The attention to detail is astounding, with every town, dungeon, and landscape exuding a distinct sense of place and history

So it's even more confusing.
    I'm sure there can be both spaces that are atmospheric and add to the worldbuilding while also not having the most compelling level design.

Sums up a fair bit of Dark Souls 2 well for me lol, a game I'm fond of, in spite or, or perhaps in part due to its flaws.
> A game thats exclusive to PS5 cant have an open world?

It's a valid decision. IMO, most of the time open world design just pads playtime without adding much value to the experience.
I myself am pretty disappointed because the story is nothing to write home about.
The main character is FIFTEEN?! From all the pictures and trailers I thought he was AT LEAST in his mid twenties lol
    In the prologue haha. The game takes place across many years (which I definitely like). Demo is a few hours and covers the prologue.
It’s funny too because this is the least “anime” Final Fantasy game pretty much ever. I mean I loved it but if this was too much for you, steer clear of JRPGs in general.
    The combat is more anime than any other FF. That's 100% fine with me!
Same here, but it's hard to criticise anything but the framerate online. It's fair to disregard any opinion online which seems badly formed, but mention anything negative about the game's problems and you're called out for just looking for something to be upset about. The CBU3 bias is definitely real.

I resigned myself to just not raining on others' parade. I'm glad people are looking forward to the game and I think most will enjoy it because of the things it does do well. But, speaking as someone with access to a review copy, there are definite flaws here that are at least fair to be mentioned, even should they not detract from the main experience.
    >  The CBU3 bias is definitely real.

yoshi-p fans are on another level with how they worship yoshi-p, defend CBU3 and anything they do :/ you'd get piled on for even daring to suggest this game might have some issues or you not liking some part of the demo. 

it's been funny seeing their reactions to this game not getting 10/10s (most of the high scores are 9/10s, only a few 10/10s) and the metacritic score being at 88 and opencritic score at 90, cause they were going off hyping it up as "instant 10/10 masterpiece! will easily reach metacritic score of Zelda, RE4 remake, etc"
    It really is insanely frustrating sometimes to be in this hobby due to some of the culture around it.

I’ve never seen another group of people who take the slightest criticism towards something they like as if it were a personal attack. And inb4 the “good criticism is fine but complaining is not.” No? This might apply if you’re a professional critic but as a consumer you have the complete right to complain.

I’ve been in this sphere forever but the way people have attached their identities and entire existence to revolve specific brands and products is the most depressing development ive seen as of late.
    I have to say I actually loved the demo and it got me excited for the game. But completely agree that the CBU3 bias is very obvious and has been in place for months. Even just suggesting you couldn't see what people were thinking was looking good about the game led to a pile-on.
>The main character being 15 and having a fully grown adult voice

Eh, I pretty much had my fully grown voice by the time I was 15.
And Super Mario Bros. Wonder!
Jesus Christ, that is going to be glorious
I belieber in you
Honestly, I forsee a lot of controversy surrounding the Armored Core release. With FromSoft's breakout success in the past decade a lot of fans are not familiar with their catalogue of older games. Armored Core is a pretty niche experience that is probably NOT going to be a big hit with most people. I think people buying it because of their love for the Soulsborne games are going to be in for a shock.
    I can definitely see there being people who will ultimately be pissed at what they get. The same thing happened when sekiro released. Idk if there’ll be *a lot* per say. 

At this point I think people that consider themselves part of the soulsborne community are probably so starved for new content that they’ve seen the gameplay vids for any new thing fromsoft puts out and have a baseline understanding for what to expect. 

But I could be way off. I know certain people were upset with elden ring being too different from dark souls and if that can happen, anything can.
The end of the year is also packed with big releases. It's so much that I can't play all that I want to play.
    This is shaping up to be one of the best years in gaming ever.
        This is why I laugh every time I read people writing how gaming is dead or something. We see some of the best games released every year. This year is no exception.
            Some people just hyperfixate on the things they hate about gaming. I think it's just because hate is great for algorithmic content filters. So all they see is the worst stuff.

And maybe some of it is just the churn of people burning out. It's a hobby like any other and plenty of people get tired after a while.

Totally agree though, it's so packed that I'm skipping games I want to play because I just don't have the time ;-;
                > I think it's just because hate is great for algorithmic content filters. So all they see is the worst stuff.

Half that, and half that the human brain is wired in such a way that negative experiences stick around more than positive ones. So its a bad feedback loop between the two all around.
        Absolutely. I thought the golden days of late 90s/2000s were over, but this year might be the best!
            The difference I think is largely in frequency. This is a great year. But how often we get great years seems spaced further out.
        2017 had Super Mario Odyssey, Zelda Breath of the Wild, Persona 5, Nier:Automata, Horizon Zero Dawn,  Resident Evil 7, Cuphead, Nioh, What Remains of Edith Finch, Wolfenstein II, Undertale, to name a few.
            undertale was 2015
            Let's not forget Prey!
            Undertale is older than that no? Great year though. I still need to go back and beat Nier
            This year is already beating 2017 for me personally
            How about 2020? New Horizons, Doom Eternal, Hades, Persona 5 Royal, FF7 Remake, TLOU2, Half-Life Alyx, Demon's Souls, Spider-Man Miles Morales, Microsoft Flight Simulator, Yakuza Like a Dragon, Ori and the Will of the Wisps, 13 Sentinels, Ghost of Tsushima, Genshin Impact, Cyberpunk (okay, it's debatable, but it has its fans), and more.
        I think we can safely say that it is. The best year for gaming since probably 2007 or 2008.
            2011 was good, no? (Skyrim, Arkham City, MW3, Dark Souls, Battlefield 3, Portal 2, Uncharted 3)
                2017 as well
                    Yeah, 2017 was just an insane year.
                    [deleted]
                        [deleted]
                    Horizon: Zero Dawn, Nier: Automata and Persona 5 all within a few months of each other (in the west at least). 2017 was great
                        So was Breath of the Wild. Horizon has consistently come out at bad times. First game was a week before BotW. Second game came out a week before Elden Ring.
                            How could I miss BotW. Spring 2017 was on fire.
                Kinda stops there though. The reason why this year is the best in awhile is because the games are good, they're mostly all beloved franchises, and there's just sooooooo many. The list of released games this year is enough to stand against 2007 for me, and we're only halfway through the year
                    Off the top of my head, 2007 had Halo 3, CoD 4, Mass Effect, Assassin's Creed, Rock Band, GH3, Bioshock, AND Orange Box. I'm sure there are more that I missed, but to me, it's still the GOAT year
                        [deleted]
                            Supreme Commander released in 2007 as well, incredible RTS
                        Burning Crusade, Crysis, Uncharted, STALKER, God of War 2, Metroid Prime 3, Super Mario Galaxy.

What a fantastic year. I started out with Burning Crusade in January, picked up Bioshock and Orange Box in the middle, and ended with Halo 3, Mass Effect, and CoD 4. That's my personal favorite year for sure.
                Yeah, that was a great year too. But a lot of huge IPs started in 2007.
                Forgot Deus Ex: Human Revolution, The Witcher 2 and LA Noire.

2010 was almost as good IMO: Mass Effect 2, Fallout New Vegas, Bad Company 2, AC: Brotherhood, Starcraft 2, BLOPS 1, NFS Hot Pursuit, Alan Wake. Was an absolutely insane two-year period
            It’s hard to picture a year more stacked than 2007, but this year definitely feels close.
                1998 is pretty famous. You had Ocarina of Time, F-Zero X, Metal Gear Solid, Resident Evil 2, Sonic Adventure, Banjo-Kazooie, Spyro the Dragon, StarCraft, Pokemon Red and Blue (in North America), Half-Life, Grim Fandango, Thief, Baldur's Gate.

That year was insane.
                    it was doubly insane considering a lot of us were little kids for it.  I still miss when I could imagine wide worlds while playing things like Tomb Raider 2.  As an adult, I know there's "nothing there" but as a kid, you didn't know games had limitations, especially before the internet.

I miss impossible rumors like "every person you fight is an actual person somewhere playing too!" or "if you collect all 35 1/35 soldier, they come alive and kill Sephiroth before he stabs Aerith!"
                    Okay no, it’s definitely 1998 if that’s the case. That’s damn near unbeatable.
                        It actually gets better...  


OP missed:   
Mario Party, Rainbow Six, Xenogears, and Rogue Squadron among others.
                        1997 was better for me.

Diablo, Final Fantasy 7, Castlevania SOTN, Blood, MDK, Harvest Moon, Final Fantasy Tactics, Star Fox 64, GoldenEye 007, Oddworld, Fallout, Jedi Knight: Dark Forces 2, Age of Empires, Blade Runner, Quake 2 and Gran Tourismo.
                            1994 gets no love, but was pretty amazing as well.

Sonic the Hedgehog 3, X-COM: UFO Defense, Super Metroid, The Elder Scrolls: Arena, Final Fantasy VI, Magic Carpet, TIE Fighter, Earthworm Jim, The King of Fighters '94, EarthBound, The Need for Speed, Master of Magic, Mortal Kombat II, System Shock, Doom II, Sonic & Knuckles, Killer Instinct, Warcraft: Orcs & Humans, Donkey Kong Country, King's Quest VII: The Princeless Bride, Wing Commander III: Heart of the Tiger, Tekken, King's Field, Marathon, Heretic
        2017 had Super Mario Odyssey, Zelda Breath of the Wild, Persona 5, Nier:Automata, Horizon Zero Dawn,  Resident Evil 7, Cuphead, Nioh, What Remains of Edith Finch, Wolfenstein II, Undertale, to name a few.
    I managed more or less on the big releases (but I'm not interested in all of them to be fair), except TOTK reported to whenever I have the time. But I certainly not progressing on my backlog (in fact I'm adding to it lol)
    im still on PS4 and for the past few years ive felt perfectly comfortable with that and like i didnt need to upgrade anytime soon. within the past half year that’s completely been demolished and my backlog has absolutely ballooned up lol. its to the point where the longer i wait the bigger an investment the ps5 becomes because id want to buy like at least 5 $70 games right away
Is Jedi Survivor fixed on PC yet though? Last time I tried it it was still incredibly broken. I really want to play it but also don't want to support games being released in that state.
    Nope, it ain't. Still broken and crashing on specific planets. Latest patch (like 2 days ago) had no mention of significant performance or stability improvements afaik
    I'd still wait to play it, if I were you. I've played it on PC and beat it, and while it's undoubtedly a fantastic game, the experience was definitely tarnished by the sluggish frame rate and stuttering in cut scenes.
I don't think "not a bad year" describes a year with ToTK, ff16, Diablo 4, good remakes of 2 of the best horror games of all time, releases from all 3 big fighting franchises, and later this year spiderman 2, starfield, and armored core 6.
    Yeah it was an understatement. Also a new Mario 2D just announced, Pikmin 4, Baldur's Gate 3, AC Mirage, Alan Wake 2, Avatar Frontiers of Pandora, Cyberpunk 2077 revamp and expansion,...

I think like the devs have just collectively decided to all come in 2023. And weirdly we know almost nothing coming post-2023 except a few games lol.
I don't think we've seen such a strong year for video games in a long time. This is definetly in the top 5 of video game years in terms of quality output.

If Elden Ring launched this year, it'd basically be unbeatable :O
    Zelda, Resident Evil 4, Jedi Survivor, Diablo 4, Starfield, Spider-Man 2, FF16, Mario RPG, Mario Wonder, Yakuza Gaiden, Honkai Star Rail, Dead Space, Alan Wake 2, Gollum.

What a year.
        You snuck that one in there didn't you
            Yeah Zelda barely squeezed in.
        You forgot Hogwarts Legacy and Baldurs Gate 3. Absolutely nutty year.
            I really enjoyed dead island 2. The video game equivalent of a really well executed B movie with great gore and visuals
    [removed]
They only need to drop a Monster Hunter World 2 trailer to achieve absolute and total dominance this year.
    Sunbreak is done with it's TU cycle...announcement probably isn't THAT far off now
        Tokyo Game Show in September! That's where Rise was revealed.
        It's almost guaranteed to be revealed at TGS, they straight up said to monster hunter fans "to look forward to TGS 2023"
        I suspect it might still be a while since it might seem too similar to Dragon’s Dogma 2. I was hopeful too but I think world 2 gets announced closer to DD2 release
From Crapcom to Capgod in the span of a decade, what a ride
Yeah, this is gonna be one of those 'Was this one of the best years in gaming' years, I think, in discussions of the future.  I really didn't think things were going to keep getting -better- after Horizon.
    Wasn’t Horizon last year? Or are you talking about the Burning Shores DLC?
        To be fair, Burning Shores is a damned good DLC.
>At first I thought Horizon would have been a great GOTY contender

Call of the Mountain? Because Forbidden West will be close to two years old by GOTY time.
    Man you're right. I only played it this year before Jedi Survivor* (My timeline is jacked up this morning) so thats why it was still fresh to me. lol.
They're definitely not the only ones making interesting AAA games. They're good. But there's nothing \*interesting\* about RE4 REmake, for instance. It's just really damned good. There's nothing \*interesting\* about Street Fighter VI, it's just really damned good. I'll definitely give you Persona but that series has been oozing with style since 3. People are just finally catching on after 5. 

&#x200B;

I don't really like this narrative that "western devs" are creatively bankrupt when all the incentives structures to turn a profit on a game still exist in Japan. Japan has a diverse set of developers creating great games and so does "the west".
I also liked reading all the backstory during cutscenes.
    One of the standout features for me so far and I hope other games start to implement it.
        It's great for people who might need to take a break from playing and come back in a couple weeks and not remember everything in the story. And it cuts down on boring exposition for everyone.
            It’s also great for folks like me that generally steer clear of high fantasy because of all the made up regions, names, supernatural elements, etc. sounding similar and being confusing. Such a great feature
Its basically the pilot episode to the game
For real. The fact that the context of the opening fight goes from "holy shit this is fucking awesome" to "holy shit nonono please make it stop" over the course of two hours is a serious testament to the narrative heft this game carries.
I think it’s pretty wild that Square is publishing things with such discrepancies in quality. Talk about diversification.
    I'd say a large part of the quality of FF16 (and 14!)  is down to Yoshi-P and his team. The man knows exactly what direction he wants to take his games in down to the smallest detail and his team is phenomenal at executing that.

It also helps that he is high enough in the company where he can mostly tell other suits to screw off when they try to cram in NFT's or other similar garbage.
    That's just how publishers used to be, the difference is that now big publishers don't make games anymore.
I get *why* publishers can be wary of demos because the last thing they want is something like the Forespoken demo to convince everyone not to get a game, but I can really pay dividends if the game is good. Like this, I've never had much interest in FF, but this one has been piquing my interest since it was revealed, and the demo totally sold me. 

Or another example, I played the shit out of the Mortal Kombat 9 demo after never playing a console fighter other than Smash, and now I'm a few months away from buying my 6th Netherrealm Studios game in MK1, all thanks to that demo.
    Demos work is you have confidence in the game.

I've been playing a number of impressive ones in Steam Next Fest (Little Kitty Big City is basically Stray but with more stuff to knock off ledges and humans to mess with) that I don't think would get any attention without the demo.

If your game is mediocre it can backfire, but if you have real confidence in the product it's a great way to build hype.
Square Enix has always done demos for final fantasy though. I can’t think of one that didn’t. Even FF14 has a free trial that’s easily 60+ hours.
    It goes beyond Final Fantasy to Square Enix in general.

A lot of their games have had demos for years. All 3 Bravely Defaults, Forspoken, Triangle Strategy, both Octopaths, Dragon Quest 11, the new Valkyrie Profile, etc. Their collaborations with other studios (like Platinum for Nier Automata and Team Ninja for Strangers of Paradise) have also had demos.

DQ11’s demo in particular is one of the most generous demos I’ve ever seen. You get like the first 8 hours of the game.

At this point, it’s more surprising if a SE game *doesn’t* have a demo.
        By the time I hit the DQ11 demo stopping point I felt obligated to buy it cause I had so much time put in already lol
            It's funny since I had the exact opposite reaction. There was a time when I'd be all over that JRPG comfort food but playing the demo made me realise I've probably done it too many times, and I've moved on so it didn't make me want more (I stopped before the end). But I think overall it could only have helped them find more sales so it was still a good idea to release it.
        I wasn’t 100% confident as I could only definitely remember every FF game but you’re absolutely right. Square Enix has always had this practice.
man, the end of the demo really made me feel uncomfortable, just brutal.

Dragon Age Inquisition and Shadow of Mordor fought for most GOTY picks in 2014. I don't know if a game equivalent in quality this year makes the top 10 of *already released* games, without even thinking about what's to come in the second half of the year.
    We're really coming out of the Covid Lull when it comes to gaming.  It takes two won GotY in 2021, could you imagine that happening today?
        Honestly still surprised It Takes Two won over: 

* Deathloop
* Metroid Dread
* Psychonauts 2
* PS5 Ratchet & Clank
* Resident Evil 8
* Returnal

ITT wasn't even the best reviewed game of that year and yet somehow won GotY.
            Reviewers liked it but the player base LOVED it. It probably deserved to win
            Returnal should have won imo.
            Other than Metroid Dread, I think the rest were like 8/10 games... I think that was a pretty weak year tbh
    I think Dragon age Inquisition is really fantastic and definitely one of the biggest RPG of the last decade, i would absolutely put in very high among the best games of the year even if it relesed today.
    Those two games fighting for GOTY in 2014 indicates just how pathetically weak 2014 was.
        2014 had Bayonetta 2, Mario Kart 8, Shovel Knight, Divinity Original Sin, Dark Souls 2, Smash 3DS/Wii U, and Alien Isolation too

It wasn’t a great year in the grand scheme of things, but there were games to be played for sure
        Inquisition was great though. It's by far the most lore dense entry in the series. 

There were certainly some missteps (timed war table, the first area being garbage) but it was a great game as long as you weren't expecting Origins 2.
            I found Inquisition painfully mediocre in every way. Everything it did, Witcher 3 did a million times better a year later.
That’s Hi-Fi Rush for me. I thought it could at least get nominated for a GOTY award but there’s like no chance now. Still really happy with the game though.
    Hi-Fi Rush is *brilliant*, and it would absolutely be a top contender in a year that wasn't as wildly packed as this one.
    I mean, it seems like the Game Awards usually have at least one indie game nominated for GOTY each year, so I’m still hoping for Hi-Fi Rush to be there. I just want to hear the orchestra play one of its songs during the medley they always do, lol.
        Hi-Fi is not an indie, it was developed by Tango Gameworks who are a Zenimax studio.

Definitely a smaller budget title (that is incredible) but they are not an indie studio.

But yeh with you, would love to hear a medley of songs from Hi-Fi, that would be fucking awesome lmao
for sure. most years only have like 3 real contenders. all of 2021 wouldnt even be in consideration this year
And for this past June we should probably switch to Game of the Week...
Even that would be pretty hotly contested each month, lol.
Imagine if Elden Ring came out a year later than it's release date amongst all this.
We just need the new 3d Mario game to drop during holidays and it’ll basically be 2017 part 2
    Well, not 3D, but still a great looking Mario game is coming out later on this year.
        Super Mario Bros. Wonder **AND** the most unexpected thing, a 3D Remake of Super Mario RPG.  My jaw dropped.
        I just saw those, 2023 is a certified classic
I legitimately cannot remember the last time there were so many huge games in a single year, but so many of these have come out just *2 months* from one another.  In terms of critically acclaimed releases in a single year, I think 2023 may be the biggest year in gaming.  And we are only half way done with it.
    The late August/September timeframe is just crazy. Less than a month and Armored Core 6, Baldur's Gate 3, Mortal Kombat 1, Starfield and Phantom Liberty (which might as well be a full new game considering the extent of the changes it seems) are dropping. And that's just big games, there are also indies and smaller ones I probably forgot.
    Guys, just look at 2017, it's not so long ago.
Now, without spoiling anything, the first 10 you do are pretty bad and generic, but it does get better when you advance in the story. I've done roughly 30-35? and I'd say 20 of them are what I consider good.
    Honestly a few mediocre side quests is what I expect even in games with the best side quests (even Witcher 3 had its share weak ones). As long as the ratio isn’t too stilted towards the mediocre then the high points of the good quests will outweigh any negatives.
        Yeah, and honestly a few beans quests are actually good for the game in the long run I think. Makes the really good one stand out over the 'meh' ones.
Definitely spectacle over renowned combat. You're essentially Godzilla fighting things larger or as big as you. If that sounds fun to you you'll definitely enjoy it. The ones I've done are all different in their own ways so please don't mistake my description, but its 100% for the awe and not the engaging combat some might expect.
I’m about 20 hours in!
So I've personally found all enemies pair with your level, so if you felt that way with the demo enemy fodder (we're talking seperate from the mini boss battles like the dragoon) then I can say they will feel a bit spongy. 

I think thats why the combat is how it is. It forces you to combo and not just mash the attack button. If I just do that they do feel spongy, if I get huge combos by using eikon attacks + jumping and swerving that spongyness is still there but is drastically reduced. Does that make sense?
    I guess my worry was if they don’t flinch much. Do you get time to pull off combos?
        Very much. Obviously theres stagger, but if you pull big combos even when they're not staggered, they can't really do anything until you're done them lol. Very empowering if you can master them.
Im pretty avid in action RPGs, so I do believe if you're like me you would find this easy. For reference I've yet to die. + I do not use the necklaces that provide some handicaps for gameplay. 

I was debating just trying to get the New Game+ as fast as possible so I can be challenged, but decided not too and I'm just enjoying the ride. I hear that that mode is the challenge mode.

I'd say its in the middle of Final Fantasy VII Remake normal mode and hard mode.
Lively in terms of how many NPCs are around (much more than VII Remake Sector's) but don't expect Novigrad. If you played Horizon Zero Dawn, its like Meridian. Lots of talking (not to you) but going about their business.

I've been to two major cities. The towns are much smaller but still populated.
Reddit hates it, but shit, diablo released between the two and the reviews were great too.
    Which is funny because I think Diablo is probably the best Western (as in not Japanese) game so far this year with Jedi close second.
The combat was actually designed by the dude who did DMC 5 combat
    *One* of the guys who did DMC 5. Ryota Suzuki also worked on Dragon’s Dogma and Marvel Vs Capcom 2.
That's true, but it did give players some different options/experiences by the time you get Cid's plane, even if relatively minor.

Wall Market, how you played through Shinra Tower, the Phoenix thing, exploring the Golden Saucer, and getting Yuffie and/or Vincent all had the potential to give players different experiences by the time you get the plane and the map opens up a bit.
    I played FF7 my whole childhood and atleast for young me I felt completely free and even lost at so many times. At 8 years old I didn't have the gamesense to see where they were trying to lead me I suppose. All in all it took me 5-6 years to beat it (6/7yo to 12yo)
FF7 gave you the illusion of freedom while heavily guiding you around especially with the mode of transportation. Still, you could always do extra stuff or skip it - so more like a Metroidvania nowadays. For a 90's game, it was pretty open.
FF16's levels, at least in the first 8 hours, are literal hallways.

It's not about story progression being linear. That's fine. It's that the spaces you ""explore"" are literal straight lines 95% of the time.

Short, straight, empty hallways. You hold up for 15 seconds, then you get a battle, then up for 15 seconds, then a cutscene, then a battle, then up for 15 seconds, rinse and repeat ad nauseam. 

What little loot there is is basically just potions and crafting materials, and Clive automatically hoovers them up just by walking within 10 feet of them.

Oh, and they even give you a dog who will "show you the way", you know, in case you get lost in the tiny hallway that literally only gives you one way to go.

It's just unbearably hand-holdy and braindead. You might as well not give the player control to walk around if that's how it's going to be. Just have us go from cutscene to battle to cutscene to battle, cause that's all it is anyway. No need to let us explore when there's nothing to explore. It's pointless. 

And there is simply no comparison with the older games. Sure you had linear story progression for the most part, but the spaces you explored were not straight lines.

I replayed FF9 just a couple years ago, and that game has actual level design. It's not gonna blow your mind like a Dark Souls level, but the spaces you explore are not hallways. 

FF16 right now is almost making me think CBU3 do not employ any level designers.
They have, the games are just usually just really easy so the complexity is in how broken you can get it to be (Except for like the one or two optional super hard bosses every game).

Same as pokemon, it can be pretty interesting mechanically but main story is brain dead easy.
I don't know if "depth" would be the right descriptor, but FF7's materia system could lead to some pretty wacky character builds, along with FF8's junction system.
    Which is a bit of a double edged sword.  One weakness of FFVII is all the characters feel very samey because of the materia system.  That's fixed in FFVII Remake though
    the depth of the combat system will probably not be fully explored by most critics
        Probably because the game also doesn't demand that from the player.
            I just beat FF8 again last year. I kid you not I didn't use an ability outside of attack or limit break for the first 30 hours.
                Yeah FF8 has the air of complexity but it's incredibly basic and none of it is at all necessary to complete the game.
                    FF8 is legit my all time favourite game, but once you figure out how to cure-refine tents into curaga on disc 1 it is over.
                        Nah, getting Curagas from tents is nice, but the thing that breaks the game is realizing that Abyss Worm cards refine into Windmills which refine into Tornadoes.  Those will give you OP strength until the mid-game and by the mid-game you can easily get more upgrades.

Not to mention Disc 1 Lionheart, and general limit break spam.
                Yea, you just spam Aura on Squall and Renzokuken your way from disk 1 to the end of disk 4.
                    Haha yeah aura is that one non-limit break ability you cast...because it lets you cast more limits. Occasionally haste too. Ya know. More limits faster. Love the game but it feels like they literally never even gave it a single balancing pass.
    Those (and I'd add FFX and the MMOs to that list) are more the exception, honestly... It's really what makes "JRPG" different than "RPG".

Look at FFIX, for example. A wonderful, virtually perfect game, but it has very little in the way of RPG systems. In a lot of numbered FFs, pretty much the only choices that change anything are which party members you choose to bring along. (By the way, the right answer is Quina.)
    While I agree with them that FF series and JRPG's in general never really have what I would call depth in terms of the RPG systems, I replayed FF7 about a year or two ago and there's a certain satisfaction that comes from how absolutely broken you can make Tifa by putting her in the backline with Long Range materia and always making sure she has Sadness, then mixing in counter/cover/X4 attack with Powersoul and Curse Ring and giving her Odin linked with Added Effect. I can't remember my exact materia/gear setup but by the end of the game she was just demolishing everything in a turn or two.
7's materia system and even 8's junk system had some depth I'd say. Especially 7 had some absolute ridiculous combinations if you could figure (and, well, grind) them out.
    I'm a huge FF7 fan, but that game is pretty easy. It was basically the JRPG tutorial (along with Pokémon Red and Blue) for a lot of us. Materia combos can be absurd, though.
        I don't know how adult me would feel about them, but back in the day I wouldn't say the optional bosses were that easy. Of course if you look up online where to find the best weapons, limit breaks and materia you can make them fairly trivial, but I'm talking about just playing the game blind.
            That's for sure. You can cheese basically any encounter if you look it up. I do recall child me struggling with the weapons.
            The optional bosses were the only parts that had any incentive on actually using the systems, but they were also designed around selling you the Ultimania guides, that was SquareSoft's MTX back in the day, so they were basically never fair but hard, just hard with almost no way of truly figuring them out without the guide
                Fighting Emerald with no knowledge of materia for Underwater breathing.
You could literally change most characters and the job system is a hallmark of the series
The job system got much better from FF1->FF3->FF5->Bravely Default, so that was progress there. Being able to combine parts of different jobs in FF5 and even moreso in BD added a lot of depth imo.
I agree. Chrono Trigger is loved by many JRPG fans and its a very short and mechanically shallow game.
    It was 1995 on SNES, at the time the game was fairly robust in mechanics for a console game. Characters with abilities that interacted with each other was pretty exciting back then. Plus the several minigames (millennial fair, bike chase, etc) and for RPGs it set a standard for sure.

Now, yeah, it's extremely basic but it does the things it does very well. Which is hard for most new JRPGs to achieve.
        Oh I agree. I’m just saying JRPGs dont need crazy mechanical depth to be enjoyable. I like CT as much now as I did then. The game is just a vehicle for the story
To be honest, I have never considered FF's RPG aspects to be that deep at all.

For most games, you equip a weapon, you have a skill book and you equip an armor piece, an amulet or a trinket, a ring and that's it.
They're "overhauling" Dragon Quest's combat system for the next mainline entry. It might end up not being a turn-based game either.
FF15 was a unfinished game with a seemingly unfocused idea of what they wanted their action combat to be. FF7 remake improved on that, and it seems FF16 improved and mayhaps perfect it.
    FF7 remake was weirdly not much of an action game. Or it was one with a lot of menu usage. It was weird. But it's probably as close to another ATB game as we'll get
I watched the video and I think he meant as a its a more adult story than previous ff games which primarily focuses on one person rather than the party of players in other games which he prefers.
    The more mature story is one of the bigger hooks for me that sealed the deal.

Based on the demo and combat/gameplay I would have almost certainly gotten it anyway, but I personally prefer more adult/mature stories and a more 'kiddie' one would have poured some water on the entire thing for me.
        Yeah. The general tone of FF games prior kept me away from them. I played the NES and SNES ones as a kid, but never got much into anything after VI except Tactics. Seeing a trailer for the story then playing the demo had be very interested. I was just waiting for reviews to see if that tone and quality carried on for the full game and now I'm waiting for this pre-order download.
            If you love tactics then you'll love this. The devs pretty much worship FFT with XIV having a whole mini arc with the characters and locations. I expect XVI will be the same.

Fun fact: The main characters kingdom Rozaria is a reference to the offscreen rival kingdom in FFT.
    I see that as an absolute positive for me. Give me the demo tone over a full game and it'll be one of my favourite games.
        This is indeed what you get basically.
            Nice 👍
    The story kinda gives me an FF Tactics vibe tbh, which also primarily focuses on the protagonist's life. It's also very dark with a heavy political-theme.
    Is that true though?  FFVI never really had a primary protagonist and it's one of the greats
        That's what they're saying - this game focuses on the primary protagonist while most previous FF games split the story focus among the party.
            Wow, I completely misread that, thought you were saying the opposite 😅
    This too and ya it is WAY more mature and it has to be. The stuff dealt with and talked about. It would have felt weird if they were like "silly darn Susan burned the muffins"
I think he meant changes in tone. Tonally it's more mature than previous entries
    [deleted]
        FFXIV at its core is still a light hearted game though. I haven’t played or even looked much at FFXVI, but it may be that it’s gritty and dark all the time which would be a change of pace for this series.
            read that there were plenty of lighthearted moments in one review
        and then they go and (EW Spoilers) >!Goomba stomp a kid in front of his dad right on screen. God that entire Final Days section was just brutal!<
    Some previous entries were pretty dark story-wise too, to be fair. FF6 for sure. You could probably argue FF7 as well.
        Honestly this is pretty much in line with most of the Ivalice world games. I know they rarely show up in the mainline titles, but a lot of the narrative feels very comparable to FF Tactics or Vagrant Story.
More like story delivery style. I edited it. Its just very, very different in that way. It took a bit of getting accustomed to.
    Hmm interesting so it's not just gameplay->cutscene->gameplay repeat?
        > That to, at times. But more about, *I am worried about spoilers here sorry and we can't say a ton*, but the timeline changes and back and forth and who has done what where and what MIGHT be a cutscene turns into gameplay an stuff like that.
Cant dive into it much more than that.
            At the very least it sounds like an interesting approach
                It is for sure. I liked the slightly Game of thrones darker tones.
The core focuses tighter than many games before, the mature themes I discuss in the video, and how they are acted. Which I liked. But I can see people sort of thinking...weird. The first time some of the bits occur, or they watch a cutscene.
I think what he meant changes in the story is that this final fantasy has a more mature story than others.
And even that's wild given how utterly divisive FF12 was
    12 was divisive because the world wasn't ready for it yet. Mechanically and world wise its one of if not the best FF game. The gambit system was years ahead of the competition and is something a lot of games could benefit from. Its the only game where I am genuinely excited to see how the AI will handle a situation. Its a game where every new location is a joy to explore and years later people are still discussing party compositions due to how well balanced and expressive the job system in that game is.

Yes it has flaws like its story not being finished or the early game being a mess with you having to buy Gambits but even with those flaws its a brilliant game and one of the best FF games.
        > 12 was divisive because the world wasn't ready for it yet.

Hi, its me, I'm the problem its me. Granted I was like 14 when it released, I hated the mechanics. It wasn't until revisiting it a few years ago that I truly appreciated it.
        FFXII suffered by making Vaan the main character, for good reason. God he was annoying.

Also the gambit system would be niche today, it wasn't just ahead of its time, it straight up will never be for everyone, and that's okay.  Personally it is my least favourite battle system in the franchise besides 15s half-assed action approach. For perspective, my favourite is VII-Rs system, followed by X and XIII. I don't have issues with ATB either.

And like you said, the early game is so messy that it turns a lot of people off.
            Vaan and Penelo were garbage characters and dragged down the experience and the story. The ending was also half-baked.

I personally loved the gambit system but can see why it's not for everyone.
                You can tell the developer was afraid of having an older character as the main character for a final fantasy, so they created Vaan who is pretty unimportant to the story.
        Final Fantasy XII was the first FF game I played and the most appealing to me. I was extremely disappointed when the 13th part was not even close in gameplay to the previous game.
            I still love FF13’s combat system. It takes way too long to unlock Paradigms but once you do it becomes an extremely engaging balancing act. Shame about the level design though.
    12 was the first of the mainline games I didn't enjoy and I still don't understand the appeal.

The narrative is the least interesting of all the Final Fantasy games I've played. It starts off promising and the character designs are amazing, but it just doesn't quite gel. When I learned years later that the original creator's vision was compromised by Square it made so much sense. All the pieces were there, but he wasn't given creative freedom to execute it the way he wanted.

And people rail on FFXIII for it's linear corridor exploring, but FFXII was the exact same and no one seems to mind. At least FFXIII had a solid narrative with characters that all made sense.
Can we count shadowbringers and endwalker, they are basically new games with the size of the average 14 expansion
    MMO expansions get even more skewed from bias than regular releases, since only the dedicated are playing them in the first place
        and you have to be *hella dedicated* to get through ARR tbh

Took me 5 tries over years before finally sticking with it.
            Yeah I've tried twice now. Never make it past level 20 or so. Really wanna get to the "great stories" later on but I literally am falling asleep when I try to play through ARR X_X
> The last time a mainline, new Final Fantasy game pulled above a 90 on Metacritic was with FFXII

FF16 is sitting at 88 on metacritic: https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-5/final-fantasy-xvi

it never went above 90 on metacritic, was just on opencritic it did. 

90 now on opencritic: https://opencritic.com/game/14516/final-fantasy-xvi
It's down to 88 on Metacritic which is what FF7R got. I don't understand why, I was banking on a 93 on open critic and I thought that was perhaps a little conservative (I did not want to entertain a 95 or higher despite how high quality the game seemed) but 88 on Metacritic and now down to 90 on Open Critic is beyond even my conservative estimate. A lot of the 70 reviews are complaining about the shallow RPG mechanics, simple combat (bullet sponge enemies that don't require much other than mindless burning of their healthbars), side quests or "overambitious"main story that fails to piece things together. Seems a wee bit more divisive than I expected. What a shame, I was thinking this game would embarrass 7R.

    opencrotic down to 90 now: https://opencritic.com/game/14516/final-fantasy-xvi
i definitely did not appreciate it at the time but holy shit it really is the best bro trip game in the series.
My favorite FF, damn sphere grid is so oddly satisfying.
It's in my backlog too. All the FF kind of are I guess but I actually own this one, just haven't got around to play it
    I love the FF games, but if you aren't a big fan of JRPGs, especially if you don't like turn based combat, then it might be hard to go back to the first 10 mainline games. Just know that every numbered mainline game is completely unrelated to the others. There is no overarching story from 1-15 leading into 16. There have been sequels, prequels, and spin-offs of some of them though. 

1-6 are pixel based classic games. With the pixel remasters, that's the easiest and most convenient way to play them all. They mostly are similar with different mechanics introduced in each. 

7, 8, and 9 were all PS1 era games each with HD remasters. 7 has the first 3D graphics of the series, and it looks rough, even with the HD remaster. They all run on the same engine and are often considered a trilogy of sorts, but still had no relation to each other. 

10 is the first one with voice acting and the graphics were a huge step up at the time. It has a direct sequel (10-2).

11 and 14 are literally MMOs that take hundreds of hours to get through (look up a recap of you'd like). They seem like good games, but not an MMO kinda guy. 

12 was decent but it was the first (single player) step away from turn based combat. It plays almost identically to the first Dragon Age if you happen to have played that. It has at least a spinoff

FF13 and it's 2 sequels are harder to play if you don't have a PS3 or Xbox with backwards compatibility (emulation may be possible). They're the only ones I haven't played enough to remember. I started 13, but it just didn't click for me at the time. If I remember right, they tried a more action based approach to a turn based combat. I want to give them a fair try, but haven't had the chance. 

15 was unique and more of a hack and slash type gameplay, with a very different style. I really enjoyed 15, but I know I'm in the minority there. 

If you play FF7 Remake I'd also **highly** recommend the prequel Crisis Core Reunion. I love it's story and it has some very interesting tie in with the remake and it's sequel.
I don’t believe it’ll be ever coming to Xbox.
Yeah this is what I was expecting after XIV tbh.

Definitely not CBU3's forte.
    what you don't like having large pretty environments except restricted by the one narrow path the player is allowed to walk in? ff14 is abysmal at exploration, other games do it so much better
        14 is terrible for exploration but in the exact opposite direction 

Starting with HW and areas designed with flying in mind every single area is just a giant open bowl with absolutely nothing of value inside it
    [deleted]
        The story of the sidequests is usually good. The gameplay...is not.
I heard the opposite, some say the game falls off the second half where even main quest starts to feel like sidequest.
    There seems to be a trend in the reviews that says the second half is much stronger but I don’t doubt that some people think otherwise
all the complaints i've seen are pretty valid, the first playthrough on action mode is too easy for most of the mechanics to ever be used.

i always replay these games so i'm fine with it being moderately challenging while i'm focused on the story and then NG+ being wild, that sounds like a good middle ground. i guess they could make NG+ available from the start, but that would be a worse mode imo, since wouldn't have your full suite of tools.

i like how they're doin it!
God of War 2018 let you start on GMGoW difficulty immediately and while it was frustrating at times that's what I signed up for and am happy it gave me the choice.
It’s warped some people/groups to the point of brainrot unfortunately.
    It's called personal preference... I also want hard mode by default instead of needing to earn it
Bruh he rated The Callisto Protocol and Ghostwire: Tokyo higher than both FF16 and Crisis Core remake.
    Ghostwire Tokyo is higher than ff16? Now that's funny.
        Callisto is such a bad game lol. It’s like they modded one section of dead space and you keep redoing that spot 1000 times
        I absolutely love Ghostwire (I’ve 100%ed it twice) but even I think that sounds like quite the take based on the FF16 demo.
    We are in for a weird time where Tales of Arise has a better metacritic score than FFXVI

Reviews are a funny thing when looked at  from a distance
        Not that weird, Tales of Arise is superb.
            I first half of Tales of Arise is superb, the latter portions I found to be less so (not much less, but still less).
            >Tales of Arise is superb.

Is it? I thought it was average. Xenoblade 3 that came out not long after was far superior.
    That's just absurd. Calistos combat system was borderline broken from a fundamental level
could be someone who subscribes to the notion that 5/10 means average and 6/10 is already a positive score. Similar to how YourMovieSucks rates movies.

It's not a bad system as it allows for a bit more nuance that the standard "10=great, 9=good, 8=mostly good, 7=disappointing, 6 and lowe = literal garbage" ranking used for video games.

There are some implications when it comes to actively swimming against the stream (like developers bonuses tied to metascore rankings) but at least in isolation it's not an inherently good or bad thing to use a different scale
    One problem with scoring that way is video games can go much lower than movies. Movie reviews don't generally have to deal with the movie crashing.
        I feel like most of the time technical issues are left out of the review score and instead are mentioned as a warning separate from it. I mean, look at the review scores of highly buggy (at lunch) games like cyberpunk, Witcher, Skyrim etc.

When a buggy game gets bad review scores then it's usually because the critics aren't a big fan of the game to begin with (forspoken, fallout 76 at launch etc)
I wish most reviewers averaged scores in that range...

I suppose it can be useful for people who hate story driven games to see how someone who also hates story driven games reviews a game.
It’s always good to have opinions from people who aren’t usually into them sort of games, if it was only FF fans or JRPG fans then the reviews would be incredible biased.

There is a middle ground between open world and hallway level design.

Games like Dark Souls, Resident Evil, the recent God of War games, or the Metroidvania genre in general have interesting levels that offer satisfying exploration, without being open world.

Hallway levels are just awful, there is no excuse to ever have that in any AAA action RPG.

If you look at some of the classic FF games, the story was linear but not the spaces you explored.

FF16 has short, empty hallways. I'm not asking for an open world, I just want the bare minimum effort put into level design so I can actually get a little bit of exploration in my video game.

They create these beautiful, fascinating environments, and you can't engage with them at all. You're on a guided tour. Look but don't touch.

You hold up for 15 seconds, then you get a battle, then a cutscene, then up for 15 seconds again, rinse and repeat.

At that point why even give us control to walk around at all? It's literally pointless, I don't need to be holding up for 15 seconds.

All this game has to offer is cutscenes and battles so they might as well just auto-load us into battle after each cutscene ends because there's really no reason to ever give you control to walk around.
Or for phase transitions.
I mean, the rest of that first eikon fight was just holding triangle and moving the cursor. It wasn't super in-depth or engaging. 

That being said, it was only the first one of these in the game so I assume they get more hands on and interesting as the game continues.
💯 they're spectacles that happen every once in a while. You can't make them complex with heavy mechanics that you gotta learn.
    Why not? Honest question.
        I don't think the Eikon battles are gonna happen often enough for you to be able to grasp a completely new and varied moveset.
        Probably because it's a waste of time and resource to develop a complex mechanics for something that you do for maybe 7 times in the whole game.
            Every fight will be different mechanically too IIRC
Asura's Wrath was awesome and that's basically the whole game
    I liked how Metal Gear Rising did QTEs.
Having JUST finished GoW (2018) yesterday... that last boss fight actually slapped, even though I usually dislike QTE's they made it look & feel great.
Same.  I get easily frustrated by gimmick fights, so I'd rather just have those fights be a glorified interactive cutscenes and have the gameplay focus be on Clive.
I don't think I've ever experienced a QTE event I wouldn't rather have just experienced as a cutscene where I could put the controller down and enjoy the spectacle instead of sitting on edge scanning for prompts.
"I like this game therefore any reviewer who dislikes it is wrong"

The same people who complain that critic score doesn't mean anything nowadays are usually the same to screech whenever a publication gives an outlier score.
The whole rant about the slavery part is like:

this is why games writers don't go after complex subjects in their games, because people bitch about it but if they're not there; they'll bitch about that too. Can't win.
    > this is why games writers don't go after complex subjects in their games, because people bitch about it but if they're not there; they'll bitch about that too. Can't win.

Are we at the point where "slavery is bad" is considered a "complex subject"? If anything, I feel like it's the opposite of a complex issue, at least when you are just tackling the issue head on.
        You can't make slavery a complex at all subject because morally it's wrong and the moment you even try to justify it economically or culturally it's gonna be a PR shitshow.
    I wouldn't go that far. There's a school of thought that games are chill entertainment first, and if they don't dissect really complex and thorny social issues with nuance and care, that's ok. 

Then there's another school of thought which views games and movies as art forms on par with literature or more "serious" movies, and if they bring up a real world issue, they better damn well treat that issue with respect. 

Which reviews speak to you depend, IMO, on which school you subscribe to. I know I've seen movies before, where I look at the reviews and wonder whether critics have watched the same movie I have, simply because we had different ideas on how topics should be treated in films.
    Is slavery = bad really a complex topic, though? Like the criticism isn't "the game has slavery", it's that "MC realizing slavery is bad" is a very weak and tired plot hook. Whether you agree with that or not, I don't think you're characterizing it fairly; the problem Gita seems to have is that it discards interesting/complex topics for a simple slavery plot
        I don’t think its that outlandish for Clive to realize its wrong later in life. Dude grew up as a child soldier in a world where slavery is literally the only thing keeping these nations functioning.
            Well, there are two things here.

First, in-game, Clive is already visibly uncomfortable with slavery as a child and then literally sold into slavery. It may be hard to square this with a realize slavery is wrong plot, which Gita notes.

Second, the criticism isn't necessarily that the plot doesn't make sense, it's a criticism of the plot the writers chose. The game can justify an MC realizing slavery is wrong but the writers still had to decide that was the story they wanted to tell and Gita clearly finds that story pretty boring and tired.
            True, but it doesn't change the fact that "slavery is bad" isn't a complex topic to tackle. I get that in the world of FF16 that may be an incredible revelation, but in storytelling in general, that isn't some great narrative feat.
                Who says it’s an incredible revelation? It comes in the first 3 hours of the game when Clive gets to the hideout.  It’s a 30 hour rpg.
            Not only that - he grew up as a son of the ruler (even if not chosed to be the Dominant), so his grew up as part of a royalty and not common folk. 

And even then, in the prologue he treats branded man just like any other person, so he has a kind heart
            A story having a good internal logic doesn't automatically make the story good, or make it not trite. It can both be true that Clive thinking slavery okay for a time makes sense for him and the world and the story of any character thinking slavery was okay is lame by the standards of today. Look at Avatar 1. That director puts his foot into the worldbuilding, it's kind of insane, and ~~people loved that movie~~ it made an equally insane amount of money. It's still FernGully. Or The Last Samurai. Or the older movies I can't remember.
                [Dan Olson made a really good video about this that he calls the "Thermian Argument"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxV8gAGmbtk). Alternatively known as Watsonian perspective.
                    I'm a Folding Ideas fan but I've never seen this video. Thanks, this is everything I mean, and surely what Polygon's talking about.
        Clive grew up a spoiled lordling, it's not a far step.

Rich people live in bubbles, I think it's pretty accurate. 

I know it's a joke but 'what could a banana cost? 10 dollars?' comes to mind.
            It might make sense logically, but that doesn't make it any more interesting. "Privileged man realizes slavery bad" is a very well-worn arc that often comes off as dull and pointless unless the story has something new to say.

No idea how well it plays out in-game, haven't played it, but feeling it chose a tired premise and did nothing with it is valid criticism for a story-focused game.
        Eh most plot hooks can sound weak and like something that's been done countless times already if you try to summarise it in one sentence.

Don't misunderstand I'm not saying whether FF XVI story is great/bad because I obviously haven't played the game already. I'm only saying, just because the plot hook have been done already, doesn't make it bad. It's the execution that matters.

For example "A good man turns bad due to life circumstances" is something that's been done countless times before and sounds tiring as fuck, but that doesn't change the fact that Breaking Bad is one of the best shows of all time and Walt's slowly becoming more and more fucked up with each season is a joy to follow.
            Sure, the game could be great, and most reviews are super positive on the story. I’m more noting that the criticism from Polygon is very understandable and not absurd, especially since it doesn’t even affect the precious metascore. People having very different takes and tastes than others isn't always a sign of bad faith or whatever.
    Maybe they're complaining because they, uh, thought the game handled the subject poorly?

Dunno how the scenario of "you asked for this to be in the game, this game did it badly, and you're criticizing it for handling it badly? checkmate" unironically became a "gotcha" people use.
    Is that true tho? Maybe not in most mainstream games, but thats true for most pop culture in every form of entertainment and most media. It's mostly about applying to the lowest denominator and selling well. There's plenty of indies and AA games that go for more. Besides that, gamer's love to complain about things being "woke" online
    When you make a serious game with serious topics, you are going to have more criticism when you don't handle themes, topics, etc. well. That's just regular criticism.
Yes for hard of hearing.
I don't know about high contrast mode, but it does have an option to turn on a visual indicator for audio cues (and of course it has sub-titles).
Yep. You can't criticize shit these days without getting assblasted by fan boys.


The game is far from perfect. Very far. From performance, to pacing, to just not even feeling like a final fantasy game (not the turn based complaint). Exploration is meaningless. Shiny blue markers for items to get 2 Gil is a joke. I'm multiple hours into the game now and haven't found any real items. Inventory maxing out potions is dumb since the game let's you put it into easy mode anyway. Fighting a giant boss for 5 mins gives 60 xp, fighting 3 humans with 3 eiikon abilities in 5 seconds gives 30 xp. The ability system feels bad, you just spam cooldownd asap. 

It feels like they wanted to make a movie and then somewhere realized that they had to make a game as well and tacked that on. 


I paid my 70 bucks, so I'm going to grind it out, but it already feels like a chore instead of fun. They really missed the mark imo.
For this kind of game, definitely. It's not like the problems detract too much from the core, which is why I said most will probably enjoy it.

> It feels weird to make this argument while also attacking that paragraph from the article. Does diversity matter or not?

In this instance it's rather clear the OP wants to highlight the hypocrisy.
>the American obsession with race and representation

Tbf this wasn't even written by an American; it's a British writer in a publication literally called Eurogamer.
    Honestly, British is so Americanized at this point.
I can appreciate those scenes sometimes but I feel that they were way over done in Endwalker.
    Nod. Nod. Chest bump. Nod.
        No fist clench?
The game starts with one difficulty mode but you can add accessories that make certain mechanics easier or no effort. One accessory makes you auto dodge, another makes dodging a quick time event, and another makes combos just one button press. It's your choice to equip them or not. 

Once you beat the game, there is a higher difficulty mode and/or you can play areas of the game as stages and compete for high scores.
I'm sure there can be both spaces that are atmospheric and add to the worldbuilding while also not having the most compelling level design.

Sums up a fair bit of Dark Souls 2 well for me lol, a game I'm fond of, in spite or, or perhaps in part due to its flaws.
In the prologue haha. The game takes place across many years (which I definitely like). Demo is a few hours and covers the prologue.
The combat is more anime than any other FF. That's 100% fine with me!
>  The CBU3 bias is definitely real.

yoshi-p fans are on another level with how they worship yoshi-p, defend CBU3 and anything they do :/ you'd get piled on for even daring to suggest this game might have some issues or you not liking some part of the demo. 

it's been funny seeing their reactions to this game not getting 10/10s (most of the high scores are 9/10s, only a few 10/10s) and the metacritic score being at 88 and opencritic score at 90, cause they were going off hyping it up as "instant 10/10 masterpiece! will easily reach metacritic score of Zelda, RE4 remake, etc"
It really is insanely frustrating sometimes to be in this hobby due to some of the culture around it.

I’ve never seen another group of people who take the slightest criticism towards something they like as if it were a personal attack. And inb4 the “good criticism is fine but complaining is not.” No? This might apply if you’re a professional critic but as a consumer you have the complete right to complain.

I’ve been in this sphere forever but the way people have attached their identities and entire existence to revolve specific brands and products is the most depressing development ive seen as of late.
I have to say I actually loved the demo and it got me excited for the game. But completely agree that the CBU3 bias is very obvious and has been in place for months. Even just suggesting you couldn't see what people were thinking was looking good about the game led to a pile-on.
I can definitely see there being people who will ultimately be pissed at what they get. The same thing happened when sekiro released. Idk if there’ll be *a lot* per say. 

At this point I think people that consider themselves part of the soulsborne community are probably so starved for new content that they’ve seen the gameplay vids for any new thing fromsoft puts out and have a baseline understanding for what to expect. 

But I could be way off. I know certain people were upset with elden ring being too different from dark souls and if that can happen, anything can.
This is shaping up to be one of the best years in gaming ever.
    This is why I laugh every time I read people writing how gaming is dead or something. We see some of the best games released every year. This year is no exception.
        Some people just hyperfixate on the things they hate about gaming. I think it's just because hate is great for algorithmic content filters. So all they see is the worst stuff.

And maybe some of it is just the churn of people burning out. It's a hobby like any other and plenty of people get tired after a while.

Totally agree though, it's so packed that I'm skipping games I want to play because I just don't have the time ;-;
            > I think it's just because hate is great for algorithmic content filters. So all they see is the worst stuff.

Half that, and half that the human brain is wired in such a way that negative experiences stick around more than positive ones. So its a bad feedback loop between the two all around.
    Absolutely. I thought the golden days of late 90s/2000s were over, but this year might be the best!
        The difference I think is largely in frequency. This is a great year. But how often we get great years seems spaced further out.
    2017 had Super Mario Odyssey, Zelda Breath of the Wild, Persona 5, Nier:Automata, Horizon Zero Dawn,  Resident Evil 7, Cuphead, Nioh, What Remains of Edith Finch, Wolfenstein II, Undertale, to name a few.
        undertale was 2015
        Let's not forget Prey!
        Undertale is older than that no? Great year though. I still need to go back and beat Nier
        This year is already beating 2017 for me personally
        How about 2020? New Horizons, Doom Eternal, Hades, Persona 5 Royal, FF7 Remake, TLOU2, Half-Life Alyx, Demon's Souls, Spider-Man Miles Morales, Microsoft Flight Simulator, Yakuza Like a Dragon, Ori and the Will of the Wisps, 13 Sentinels, Ghost of Tsushima, Genshin Impact, Cyberpunk (okay, it's debatable, but it has its fans), and more.
    I think we can safely say that it is. The best year for gaming since probably 2007 or 2008.
        2011 was good, no? (Skyrim, Arkham City, MW3, Dark Souls, Battlefield 3, Portal 2, Uncharted 3)
            2017 as well
                Yeah, 2017 was just an insane year.

                    [deleted]
                Horizon: Zero Dawn, Nier: Automata and Persona 5 all within a few months of each other (in the west at least). 2017 was great
                    So was Breath of the Wild. Horizon has consistently come out at bad times. First game was a week before BotW. Second game came out a week before Elden Ring.
                        How could I miss BotW. Spring 2017 was on fire.
            Kinda stops there though. The reason why this year is the best in awhile is because the games are good, they're mostly all beloved franchises, and there's just sooooooo many. The list of released games this year is enough to stand against 2007 for me, and we're only halfway through the year
                Off the top of my head, 2007 had Halo 3, CoD 4, Mass Effect, Assassin's Creed, Rock Band, GH3, Bioshock, AND Orange Box. I'm sure there are more that I missed, but to me, it's still the GOAT year
                    [deleted]
                        Supreme Commander released in 2007 as well, incredible RTS
                    Burning Crusade, Crysis, Uncharted, STALKER, God of War 2, Metroid Prime 3, Super Mario Galaxy.

What a fantastic year. I started out with Burning Crusade in January, picked up Bioshock and Orange Box in the middle, and ended with Halo 3, Mass Effect, and CoD 4. That's my personal favorite year for sure.
            Yeah, that was a great year too. But a lot of huge IPs started in 2007.
            Forgot Deus Ex: Human Revolution, The Witcher 2 and LA Noire.

2010 was almost as good IMO: Mass Effect 2, Fallout New Vegas, Bad Company 2, AC: Brotherhood, Starcraft 2, BLOPS 1, NFS Hot Pursuit, Alan Wake. Was an absolutely insane two-year period
        It’s hard to picture a year more stacked than 2007, but this year definitely feels close.
            1998 is pretty famous. You had Ocarina of Time, F-Zero X, Metal Gear Solid, Resident Evil 2, Sonic Adventure, Banjo-Kazooie, Spyro the Dragon, StarCraft, Pokemon Red and Blue (in North America), Half-Life, Grim Fandango, Thief, Baldur's Gate.

That year was insane.
                it was doubly insane considering a lot of us were little kids for it.  I still miss when I could imagine wide worlds while playing things like Tomb Raider 2.  As an adult, I know there's "nothing there" but as a kid, you didn't know games had limitations, especially before the internet.

I miss impossible rumors like "every person you fight is an actual person somewhere playing too!" or "if you collect all 35 1/35 soldier, they come alive and kill Sephiroth before he stabs Aerith!"
                Okay no, it’s definitely 1998 if that’s the case. That’s damn near unbeatable.
                    It actually gets better...  


OP missed:   
Mario Party, Rainbow Six, Xenogears, and Rogue Squadron among others.
                    1997 was better for me.

Diablo, Final Fantasy 7, Castlevania SOTN, Blood, MDK, Harvest Moon, Final Fantasy Tactics, Star Fox 64, GoldenEye 007, Oddworld, Fallout, Jedi Knight: Dark Forces 2, Age of Empires, Blade Runner, Quake 2 and Gran Tourismo.
                        1994 gets no love, but was pretty amazing as well.

Sonic the Hedgehog 3, X-COM: UFO Defense, Super Metroid, The Elder Scrolls: Arena, Final Fantasy VI, Magic Carpet, TIE Fighter, Earthworm Jim, The King of Fighters '94, EarthBound, The Need for Speed, Master of Magic, Mortal Kombat II, System Shock, Doom II, Sonic & Knuckles, Killer Instinct, Warcraft: Orcs & Humans, Donkey Kong Country, King's Quest VII: The Princeless Bride, Wing Commander III: Heart of the Tiger, Tekken, King's Field, Marathon, Heretic
    2017 had Super Mario Odyssey, Zelda Breath of the Wild, Persona 5, Nier:Automata, Horizon Zero Dawn,  Resident Evil 7, Cuphead, Nioh, What Remains of Edith Finch, Wolfenstein II, Undertale, to name a few.
I managed more or less on the big releases (but I'm not interested in all of them to be fair), except TOTK reported to whenever I have the time. But I certainly not progressing on my backlog (in fact I'm adding to it lol)
im still on PS4 and for the past few years ive felt perfectly comfortable with that and like i didnt need to upgrade anytime soon. within the past half year that’s completely been demolished and my backlog has absolutely ballooned up lol. its to the point where the longer i wait the bigger an investment the ps5 becomes because id want to buy like at least 5 $70 games right away
Nope, it ain't. Still broken and crashing on specific planets. Latest patch (like 2 days ago) had no mention of significant performance or stability improvements afaik
I'd still wait to play it, if I were you. I've played it on PC and beat it, and while it's undoubtedly a fantastic game, the experience was definitely tarnished by the sluggish frame rate and stuttering in cut scenes.
Yeah it was an understatement. Also a new Mario 2D just announced, Pikmin 4, Baldur's Gate 3, AC Mirage, Alan Wake 2, Avatar Frontiers of Pandora, Cyberpunk 2077 revamp and expansion,...

I think like the devs have just collectively decided to all come in 2023. And weirdly we know almost nothing coming post-2023 except a few games lol.
Zelda, Resident Evil 4, Jedi Survivor, Diablo 4, Starfield, Spider-Man 2, FF16, Mario RPG, Mario Wonder, Yakuza Gaiden, Honkai Star Rail, Dead Space, Alan Wake 2, Gollum.

What a year.
    You snuck that one in there didn't you
        Yeah Zelda barely squeezed in.
    You forgot Hogwarts Legacy and Baldurs Gate 3. Absolutely nutty year.
        I really enjoyed dead island 2. The video game equivalent of a really well executed B movie with great gore and visuals
[removed]
Sunbreak is done with it's TU cycle...announcement probably isn't THAT far off now
    Tokyo Game Show in September! That's where Rise was revealed.
    It's almost guaranteed to be revealed at TGS, they straight up said to monster hunter fans "to look forward to TGS 2023"
    I suspect it might still be a while since it might seem too similar to Dragon’s Dogma 2. I was hopeful too but I think world 2 gets announced closer to DD2 release
Wasn’t Horizon last year? Or are you talking about the Burning Shores DLC?
    To be fair, Burning Shores is a damned good DLC.
Man you're right. I only played it this year before Jedi Survivor* (My timeline is jacked up this morning) so thats why it was still fresh to me. lol.
One of the standout features for me so far and I hope other games start to implement it.
    It's great for people who might need to take a break from playing and come back in a couple weeks and not remember everything in the story. And it cuts down on boring exposition for everyone.
        It’s also great for folks like me that generally steer clear of high fantasy because of all the made up regions, names, supernatural elements, etc. sounding similar and being confusing. Such a great feature
I'd say a large part of the quality of FF16 (and 14!)  is down to Yoshi-P and his team. The man knows exactly what direction he wants to take his games in down to the smallest detail and his team is phenomenal at executing that.

It also helps that he is high enough in the company where he can mostly tell other suits to screw off when they try to cram in NFT's or other similar garbage.
That's just how publishers used to be, the difference is that now big publishers don't make games anymore.
Demos work is you have confidence in the game.

I've been playing a number of impressive ones in Steam Next Fest (Little Kitty Big City is basically Stray but with more stuff to knock off ledges and humans to mess with) that I don't think would get any attention without the demo.

If your game is mediocre it can backfire, but if you have real confidence in the product it's a great way to build hype.
It goes beyond Final Fantasy to Square Enix in general.

A lot of their games have had demos for years. All 3 Bravely Defaults, Forspoken, Triangle Strategy, both Octopaths, Dragon Quest 11, the new Valkyrie Profile, etc. Their collaborations with other studios (like Platinum for Nier Automata and Team Ninja for Strangers of Paradise) have also had demos.

DQ11’s demo in particular is one of the most generous demos I’ve ever seen. You get like the first 8 hours of the game.

At this point, it’s more surprising if a SE game *doesn’t* have a demo.
    By the time I hit the DQ11 demo stopping point I felt obligated to buy it cause I had so much time put in already lol
        It's funny since I had the exact opposite reaction. There was a time when I'd be all over that JRPG comfort food but playing the demo made me realise I've probably done it too many times, and I've moved on so it didn't make me want more (I stopped before the end). But I think overall it could only have helped them find more sales so it was still a good idea to release it.
    I wasn’t 100% confident as I could only definitely remember every FF game but you’re absolutely right. Square Enix has always had this practice.
We're really coming out of the Covid Lull when it comes to gaming.  It takes two won GotY in 2021, could you imagine that happening today?
    Honestly still surprised It Takes Two won over: 

* Deathloop
* Metroid Dread
* Psychonauts 2
* PS5 Ratchet & Clank
* Resident Evil 8
* Returnal

ITT wasn't even the best reviewed game of that year and yet somehow won GotY.
        Reviewers liked it but the player base LOVED it. It probably deserved to win
        Returnal should have won imo.
        Other than Metroid Dread, I think the rest were like 8/10 games... I think that was a pretty weak year tbh
I think Dragon age Inquisition is really fantastic and definitely one of the biggest RPG of the last decade, i would absolutely put in very high among the best games of the year even if it relesed today.
Those two games fighting for GOTY in 2014 indicates just how pathetically weak 2014 was.
    2014 had Bayonetta 2, Mario Kart 8, Shovel Knight, Divinity Original Sin, Dark Souls 2, Smash 3DS/Wii U, and Alien Isolation too

It wasn’t a great year in the grand scheme of things, but there were games to be played for sure
    Inquisition was great though. It's by far the most lore dense entry in the series. 

There were certainly some missteps (timed war table, the first area being garbage) but it was a great game as long as you weren't expecting Origins 2.
        I found Inquisition painfully mediocre in every way. Everything it did, Witcher 3 did a million times better a year later.
Hi-Fi Rush is *brilliant*, and it would absolutely be a top contender in a year that wasn't as wildly packed as this one.
I mean, it seems like the Game Awards usually have at least one indie game nominated for GOTY each year, so I’m still hoping for Hi-Fi Rush to be there. I just want to hear the orchestra play one of its songs during the medley they always do, lol.
    Hi-Fi is not an indie, it was developed by Tango Gameworks who are a Zenimax studio.

Definitely a smaller budget title (that is incredible) but they are not an indie studio.

But yeh with you, would love to hear a medley of songs from Hi-Fi, that would be fucking awesome lmao
Well, not 3D, but still a great looking Mario game is coming out later on this year.
    Super Mario Bros. Wonder **AND** the most unexpected thing, a 3D Remake of Super Mario RPG.  My jaw dropped.
    I just saw those, 2023 is a certified classic
The late August/September timeframe is just crazy. Less than a month and Armored Core 6, Baldur's Gate 3, Mortal Kombat 1, Starfield and Phantom Liberty (which might as well be a full new game considering the extent of the changes it seems) are dropping. And that's just big games, there are also indies and smaller ones I probably forgot.
Guys, just look at 2017, it's not so long ago.
Honestly a few mediocre side quests is what I expect even in games with the best side quests (even Witcher 3 had its share weak ones). As long as the ratio isn’t too stilted towards the mediocre then the high points of the good quests will outweigh any negatives.
    Yeah, and honestly a few beans quests are actually good for the game in the long run I think. Makes the really good one stand out over the 'meh' ones.
I guess my worry was if they don’t flinch much. Do you get time to pull off combos?
    Very much. Obviously theres stagger, but if you pull big combos even when they're not staggered, they can't really do anything until you're done them lol. Very empowering if you can master them.
Which is funny because I think Diablo is probably the best Western (as in not Japanese) game so far this year with Jedi close second.
*One* of the guys who did DMC 5. Ryota Suzuki also worked on Dragon’s Dogma and Marvel Vs Capcom 2.
I played FF7 my whole childhood and atleast for young me I felt completely free and even lost at so many times. At 8 years old I didn't have the gamesense to see where they were trying to lead me I suppose. All in all it took me 5-6 years to beat it (6/7yo to 12yo)
Which is a bit of a double edged sword.  One weakness of FFVII is all the characters feel very samey because of the materia system.  That's fixed in FFVII Remake though
the depth of the combat system will probably not be fully explored by most critics
    Probably because the game also doesn't demand that from the player.
        I just beat FF8 again last year. I kid you not I didn't use an ability outside of attack or limit break for the first 30 hours.
            Yeah FF8 has the air of complexity but it's incredibly basic and none of it is at all necessary to complete the game.
                FF8 is legit my all time favourite game, but once you figure out how to cure-refine tents into curaga on disc 1 it is over.
                    Nah, getting Curagas from tents is nice, but the thing that breaks the game is realizing that Abyss Worm cards refine into Windmills which refine into Tornadoes.  Those will give you OP strength until the mid-game and by the mid-game you can easily get more upgrades.

Not to mention Disc 1 Lionheart, and general limit break spam.
            Yea, you just spam Aura on Squall and Renzokuken your way from disk 1 to the end of disk 4.
                Haha yeah aura is that one non-limit break ability you cast...because it lets you cast more limits. Occasionally haste too. Ya know. More limits faster. Love the game but it feels like they literally never even gave it a single balancing pass.
Those (and I'd add FFX and the MMOs to that list) are more the exception, honestly... It's really what makes "JRPG" different than "RPG".

Look at FFIX, for example. A wonderful, virtually perfect game, but it has very little in the way of RPG systems. In a lot of numbered FFs, pretty much the only choices that change anything are which party members you choose to bring along. (By the way, the right answer is Quina.)
While I agree with them that FF series and JRPG's in general never really have what I would call depth in terms of the RPG systems, I replayed FF7 about a year or two ago and there's a certain satisfaction that comes from how absolutely broken you can make Tifa by putting her in the backline with Long Range materia and always making sure she has Sadness, then mixing in counter/cover/X4 attack with Powersoul and Curse Ring and giving her Odin linked with Added Effect. I can't remember my exact materia/gear setup but by the end of the game she was just demolishing everything in a turn or two.
I'm a huge FF7 fan, but that game is pretty easy. It was basically the JRPG tutorial (along with Pokémon Red and Blue) for a lot of us. Materia combos can be absurd, though.
    I don't know how adult me would feel about them, but back in the day I wouldn't say the optional bosses were that easy. Of course if you look up online where to find the best weapons, limit breaks and materia you can make them fairly trivial, but I'm talking about just playing the game blind.
        That's for sure. You can cheese basically any encounter if you look it up. I do recall child me struggling with the weapons.
        The optional bosses were the only parts that had any incentive on actually using the systems, but they were also designed around selling you the Ultimania guides, that was SquareSoft's MTX back in the day, so they were basically never fair but hard, just hard with almost no way of truly figuring them out without the guide
            Fighting Emerald with no knowledge of materia for Underwater breathing.
It was 1995 on SNES, at the time the game was fairly robust in mechanics for a console game. Characters with abilities that interacted with each other was pretty exciting back then. Plus the several minigames (millennial fair, bike chase, etc) and for RPGs it set a standard for sure.

Now, yeah, it's extremely basic but it does the things it does very well. Which is hard for most new JRPGs to achieve.
    Oh I agree. I’m just saying JRPGs dont need crazy mechanical depth to be enjoyable. I like CT as much now as I did then. The game is just a vehicle for the story
FF7 remake was weirdly not much of an action game. Or it was one with a lot of menu usage. It was weird. But it's probably as close to another ATB game as we'll get
The more mature story is one of the bigger hooks for me that sealed the deal.

Based on the demo and combat/gameplay I would have almost certainly gotten it anyway, but I personally prefer more adult/mature stories and a more 'kiddie' one would have poured some water on the entire thing for me.
    Yeah. The general tone of FF games prior kept me away from them. I played the NES and SNES ones as a kid, but never got much into anything after VI except Tactics. Seeing a trailer for the story then playing the demo had be very interested. I was just waiting for reviews to see if that tone and quality carried on for the full game and now I'm waiting for this pre-order download.
        If you love tactics then you'll love this. The devs pretty much worship FFT with XIV having a whole mini arc with the characters and locations. I expect XVI will be the same.

Fun fact: The main characters kingdom Rozaria is a reference to the offscreen rival kingdom in FFT.
I see that as an absolute positive for me. Give me the demo tone over a full game and it'll be one of my favourite games.
    This is indeed what you get basically.
        Nice 👍
The story kinda gives me an FF Tactics vibe tbh, which also primarily focuses on the protagonist's life. It's also very dark with a heavy political-theme.
Is that true though?  FFVI never really had a primary protagonist and it's one of the greats
    That's what they're saying - this game focuses on the primary protagonist while most previous FF games split the story focus among the party.
        Wow, I completely misread that, thought you were saying the opposite 😅
This too and ya it is WAY more mature and it has to be. The stuff dealt with and talked about. It would have felt weird if they were like "silly darn Susan burned the muffins"
[deleted]
    FFXIV at its core is still a light hearted game though. I haven’t played or even looked much at FFXVI, but it may be that it’s gritty and dark all the time which would be a change of pace for this series.
        read that there were plenty of lighthearted moments in one review
    and then they go and (EW Spoilers) >!Goomba stomp a kid in front of his dad right on screen. God that entire Final Days section was just brutal!<
Some previous entries were pretty dark story-wise too, to be fair. FF6 for sure. You could probably argue FF7 as well.
    Honestly this is pretty much in line with most of the Ivalice world games. I know they rarely show up in the mainline titles, but a lot of the narrative feels very comparable to FF Tactics or Vagrant Story.
Hmm interesting so it's not just gameplay->cutscene->gameplay repeat?
    > That to, at times. But more about, *I am worried about spoilers here sorry and we can't say a ton*, but the timeline changes and back and forth and who has done what where and what MIGHT be a cutscene turns into gameplay an stuff like that.
Cant dive into it much more than that.
        At the very least it sounds like an interesting approach
            It is for sure. I liked the slightly Game of thrones darker tones.
12 was divisive because the world wasn't ready for it yet. Mechanically and world wise its one of if not the best FF game. The gambit system was years ahead of the competition and is something a lot of games could benefit from. Its the only game where I am genuinely excited to see how the AI will handle a situation. Its a game where every new location is a joy to explore and years later people are still discussing party compositions due to how well balanced and expressive the job system in that game is.

Yes it has flaws like its story not being finished or the early game being a mess with you having to buy Gambits but even with those flaws its a brilliant game and one of the best FF games.
    > 12 was divisive because the world wasn't ready for it yet.

Hi, its me, I'm the problem its me. Granted I was like 14 when it released, I hated the mechanics. It wasn't until revisiting it a few years ago that I truly appreciated it.
    FFXII suffered by making Vaan the main character, for good reason. God he was annoying.

Also the gambit system would be niche today, it wasn't just ahead of its time, it straight up will never be for everyone, and that's okay.  Personally it is my least favourite battle system in the franchise besides 15s half-assed action approach. For perspective, my favourite is VII-Rs system, followed by X and XIII. I don't have issues with ATB either.

And like you said, the early game is so messy that it turns a lot of people off.
        Vaan and Penelo were garbage characters and dragged down the experience and the story. The ending was also half-baked.

I personally loved the gambit system but can see why it's not for everyone.
            You can tell the developer was afraid of having an older character as the main character for a final fantasy, so they created Vaan who is pretty unimportant to the story.
    Final Fantasy XII was the first FF game I played and the most appealing to me. I was extremely disappointed when the 13th part was not even close in gameplay to the previous game.
        I still love FF13’s combat system. It takes way too long to unlock Paradigms but once you do it becomes an extremely engaging balancing act. Shame about the level design though.
12 was the first of the mainline games I didn't enjoy and I still don't understand the appeal.

The narrative is the least interesting of all the Final Fantasy games I've played. It starts off promising and the character designs are amazing, but it just doesn't quite gel. When I learned years later that the original creator's vision was compromised by Square it made so much sense. All the pieces were there, but he wasn't given creative freedom to execute it the way he wanted.

And people rail on FFXIII for it's linear corridor exploring, but FFXII was the exact same and no one seems to mind. At least FFXIII had a solid narrative with characters that all made sense.
MMO expansions get even more skewed from bias than regular releases, since only the dedicated are playing them in the first place
    and you have to be *hella dedicated* to get through ARR tbh

Took me 5 tries over years before finally sticking with it.
        Yeah I've tried twice now. Never make it past level 20 or so. Really wanna get to the "great stories" later on but I literally am falling asleep when I try to play through ARR X_X

I love the FF games, but if you aren't a big fan of JRPGs, especially if you don't like turn based combat, then it might be hard to go back to the first 10 mainline games. Just know that every numbered mainline game is completely unrelated to the others. There is no overarching story from 1-15 leading into 16. There have been sequels, prequels, and spin-offs of some of them though. 

1-6 are pixel based classic games. With the pixel remasters, that's the easiest and most convenient way to play them all. They mostly are similar with different mechanics introduced in each. 

7, 8, and 9 were all PS1 era games each with HD remasters. 7 has the first 3D graphics of the series, and it looks rough, even with the HD remaster. They all run on the same engine and are often considered a trilogy of sorts, but still had no relation to each other. 

10 is the first one with voice acting and the graphics were a huge step up at the time. It has a direct sequel (10-2).

11 and 14 are literally MMOs that take hundreds of hours to get through (look up a recap of you'd like). They seem like good games, but not an MMO kinda guy. 

12 was decent but it was the first (single player) step away from turn based combat. It plays almost identically to the first Dragon Age if you happen to have played that. It has at least a spinoff

FF13 and it's 2 sequels are harder to play if you don't have a PS3 or Xbox with backwards compatibility (emulation may be possible). They're the only ones I haven't played enough to remember. I started 13, but it just didn't click for me at the time. If I remember right, they tried a more action based approach to a turn based combat. I want to give them a fair try, but haven't had the chance. 

15 was unique and more of a hack and slash type gameplay, with a very different style. I really enjoyed 15, but I know I'm in the minority there. 

If you play FF7 Remake I'd also **highly** recommend the prequel Crisis Core Reunion. I love it's story and it has some very interesting tie in with the remake and it's sequel.
what you don't like having large pretty environments except restricted by the one narrow path the player is allowed to walk in? ff14 is abysmal at exploration, other games do it so much better
    14 is terrible for exploration but in the exact opposite direction 

Starting with HW and areas designed with flying in mind every single area is just a giant open bowl with absolutely nothing of value inside it
[deleted]
    The story of the sidequests is usually good. The gameplay...is not.
There seems to be a trend in the reviews that says the second half is much stronger but I don’t doubt that some people think otherwise
It's called personal preference... I also want hard mode by default instead of needing to earn it
Ghostwire Tokyo is higher than ff16? Now that's funny.
    Callisto is such a bad game lol. It’s like they modded one section of dead space and you keep redoing that spot 1000 times
    I absolutely love Ghostwire (I’ve 100%ed it twice) but even I think that sounds like quite the take based on the FF16 demo.
We are in for a weird time where Tales of Arise has a better metacritic score than FFXVI

Reviews are a funny thing when looked at  from a distance
    Not that weird, Tales of Arise is superb.
        I first half of Tales of Arise is superb, the latter portions I found to be less so (not much less, but still less).
        >Tales of Arise is superb.

Is it? I thought it was average. Xenoblade 3 that came out not long after was far superior.
That's just absurd. Calistos combat system was borderline broken from a fundamental level
One problem with scoring that way is video games can go much lower than movies. Movie reviews don't generally have to deal with the movie crashing.
    I feel like most of the time technical issues are left out of the review score and instead are mentioned as a warning separate from it. I mean, look at the review scores of highly buggy (at lunch) games like cyberpunk, Witcher, Skyrim etc.

When a buggy game gets bad review scores then it's usually because the critics aren't a big fan of the game to begin with (forspoken, fallout 76 at launch etc)

Why not? Honest question.
    I don't think the Eikon battles are gonna happen often enough for you to be able to grasp a completely new and varied moveset.
    Probably because it's a waste of time and resource to develop a complex mechanics for something that you do for maybe 7 times in the whole game.
        Every fight will be different mechanically too IIRC
I liked how Metal Gear Rising did QTEs.
> this is why games writers don't go after complex subjects in their games, because people bitch about it but if they're not there; they'll bitch about that too. Can't win.

Are we at the point where "slavery is bad" is considered a "complex subject"? If anything, I feel like it's the opposite of a complex issue, at least when you are just tackling the issue head on.
    You can't make slavery a complex at all subject because morally it's wrong and the moment you even try to justify it economically or culturally it's gonna be a PR shitshow.
I wouldn't go that far. There's a school of thought that games are chill entertainment first, and if they don't dissect really complex and thorny social issues with nuance and care, that's ok. 

Then there's another school of thought which views games and movies as art forms on par with literature or more "serious" movies, and if they bring up a real world issue, they better damn well treat that issue with respect. 

Which reviews speak to you depend, IMO, on which school you subscribe to. I know I've seen movies before, where I look at the reviews and wonder whether critics have watched the same movie I have, simply because we had different ideas on how topics should be treated in films.
Is slavery = bad really a complex topic, though? Like the criticism isn't "the game has slavery", it's that "MC realizing slavery is bad" is a very weak and tired plot hook. Whether you agree with that or not, I don't think you're characterizing it fairly; the problem Gita seems to have is that it discards interesting/complex topics for a simple slavery plot
    I don’t think its that outlandish for Clive to realize its wrong later in life. Dude grew up as a child soldier in a world where slavery is literally the only thing keeping these nations functioning.
        Well, there are two things here.

First, in-game, Clive is already visibly uncomfortable with slavery as a child and then literally sold into slavery. It may be hard to square this with a realize slavery is wrong plot, which Gita notes.

Second, the criticism isn't necessarily that the plot doesn't make sense, it's a criticism of the plot the writers chose. The game can justify an MC realizing slavery is wrong but the writers still had to decide that was the story they wanted to tell and Gita clearly finds that story pretty boring and tired.
        True, but it doesn't change the fact that "slavery is bad" isn't a complex topic to tackle. I get that in the world of FF16 that may be an incredible revelation, but in storytelling in general, that isn't some great narrative feat.
            Who says it’s an incredible revelation? It comes in the first 3 hours of the game when Clive gets to the hideout.  It’s a 30 hour rpg.
        Not only that - he grew up as a son of the ruler (even if not chosed to be the Dominant), so his grew up as part of a royalty and not common folk. 

And even then, in the prologue he treats branded man just like any other person, so he has a kind heart
        A story having a good internal logic doesn't automatically make the story good, or make it not trite. It can both be true that Clive thinking slavery okay for a time makes sense for him and the world and the story of any character thinking slavery was okay is lame by the standards of today. Look at Avatar 1. That director puts his foot into the worldbuilding, it's kind of insane, and ~~people loved that movie~~ it made an equally insane amount of money. It's still FernGully. Or The Last Samurai. Or the older movies I can't remember.
            [Dan Olson made a really good video about this that he calls the "Thermian Argument"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxV8gAGmbtk). Alternatively known as Watsonian perspective.
                I'm a Folding Ideas fan but I've never seen this video. Thanks, this is everything I mean, and surely what Polygon's talking about.
    Clive grew up a spoiled lordling, it's not a far step.

Rich people live in bubbles, I think it's pretty accurate. 

I know it's a joke but 'what could a banana cost? 10 dollars?' comes to mind.
        It might make sense logically, but that doesn't make it any more interesting. "Privileged man realizes slavery bad" is a very well-worn arc that often comes off as dull and pointless unless the story has something new to say.

No idea how well it plays out in-game, haven't played it, but feeling it chose a tired premise and did nothing with it is valid criticism for a story-focused game.
    Eh most plot hooks can sound weak and like something that's been done countless times already if you try to summarise it in one sentence.

Don't misunderstand I'm not saying whether FF XVI story is great/bad because I obviously haven't played the game already. I'm only saying, just because the plot hook have been done already, doesn't make it bad. It's the execution that matters.

For example "A good man turns bad due to life circumstances" is something that's been done countless times before and sounds tiring as fuck, but that doesn't change the fact that Breaking Bad is one of the best shows of all time and Walt's slowly becoming more and more fucked up with each season is a joy to follow.
        Sure, the game could be great, and most reviews are super positive on the story. I’m more noting that the criticism from Polygon is very understandable and not absurd, especially since it doesn’t even affect the precious metascore. People having very different takes and tastes than others isn't always a sign of bad faith or whatever.
Maybe they're complaining because they, uh, thought the game handled the subject poorly?

Dunno how the scenario of "you asked for this to be in the game, this game did it badly, and you're criticizing it for handling it badly? checkmate" unironically became a "gotcha" people use.
Is that true tho? Maybe not in most mainstream games, but thats true for most pop culture in every form of entertainment and most media. It's mostly about applying to the lowest denominator and selling well. There's plenty of indies and AA games that go for more. Besides that, gamer's love to complain about things being "woke" online
When you make a serious game with serious topics, you are going to have more criticism when you don't handle themes, topics, etc. well. That's just regular criticism.

Honestly, British is so Americanized at this point.
Nod. Nod. Chest bump. Nod.
    No fist clench?
This is why I laugh every time I read people writing how gaming is dead or something. We see some of the best games released every year. This year is no exception.
    Some people just hyperfixate on the things they hate about gaming. I think it's just because hate is great for algorithmic content filters. So all they see is the worst stuff.

And maybe some of it is just the churn of people burning out. It's a hobby like any other and plenty of people get tired after a while.

Totally agree though, it's so packed that I'm skipping games I want to play because I just don't have the time ;-;
        > I think it's just because hate is great for algorithmic content filters. So all they see is the worst stuff.

Half that, and half that the human brain is wired in such a way that negative experiences stick around more than positive ones. So its a bad feedback loop between the two all around.
Absolutely. I thought the golden days of late 90s/2000s were over, but this year might be the best!
    The difference I think is largely in frequency. This is a great year. But how often we get great years seems spaced further out.
2017 had Super Mario Odyssey, Zelda Breath of the Wild, Persona 5, Nier:Automata, Horizon Zero Dawn,  Resident Evil 7, Cuphead, Nioh, What Remains of Edith Finch, Wolfenstein II, Undertale, to name a few.
    undertale was 2015
    Let's not forget Prey!
    Undertale is older than that no? Great year though. I still need to go back and beat Nier
    This year is already beating 2017 for me personally
    How about 2020? New Horizons, Doom Eternal, Hades, Persona 5 Royal, FF7 Remake, TLOU2, Half-Life Alyx, Demon's Souls, Spider-Man Miles Morales, Microsoft Flight Simulator, Yakuza Like a Dragon, Ori and the Will of the Wisps, 13 Sentinels, Ghost of Tsushima, Genshin Impact, Cyberpunk (okay, it's debatable, but it has its fans), and more.
I think we can safely say that it is. The best year for gaming since probably 2007 or 2008.
    2011 was good, no? (Skyrim, Arkham City, MW3, Dark Souls, Battlefield 3, Portal 2, Uncharted 3)
        2017 as well
            Yeah, 2017 was just an insane year.
            [deleted]
                [deleted]
            Horizon: Zero Dawn, Nier: Automata and Persona 5 all within a few months of each other (in the west at least). 2017 was great
                So was Breath of the Wild. Horizon has consistently come out at bad times. First game was a week before BotW. Second game came out a week before Elden Ring.
                    How could I miss BotW. Spring 2017 was on fire.
        Kinda stops there though. The reason why this year is the best in awhile is because the games are good, they're mostly all beloved franchises, and there's just sooooooo many. The list of released games this year is enough to stand against 2007 for me, and we're only halfway through the year
            Off the top of my head, 2007 had Halo 3, CoD 4, Mass Effect, Assassin's Creed, Rock Band, GH3, Bioshock, AND Orange Box. I'm sure there are more that I missed, but to me, it's still the GOAT year
                [deleted]
                    Supreme Commander released in 2007 as well, incredible RTS
                Burning Crusade, Crysis, Uncharted, STALKER, God of War 2, Metroid Prime 3, Super Mario Galaxy.

What a fantastic year. I started out with Burning Crusade in January, picked up Bioshock and Orange Box in the middle, and ended with Halo 3, Mass Effect, and CoD 4. That's my personal favorite year for sure.
        Yeah, that was a great year too. But a lot of huge IPs started in 2007.
        Forgot Deus Ex: Human Revolution, The Witcher 2 and LA Noire.

2010 was almost as good IMO: Mass Effect 2, Fallout New Vegas, Bad Company 2, AC: Brotherhood, Starcraft 2, BLOPS 1, NFS Hot Pursuit, Alan Wake. Was an absolutely insane two-year period
    It’s hard to picture a year more stacked than 2007, but this year definitely feels close.
        1998 is pretty famous. You had Ocarina of Time, F-Zero X, Metal Gear Solid, Resident Evil 2, Sonic Adventure, Banjo-Kazooie, Spyro the Dragon, StarCraft, Pokemon Red and Blue (in North America), Half-Life, Grim Fandango, Thief, Baldur's Gate.

That year was insane.
            it was doubly insane considering a lot of us were little kids for it.  I still miss when I could imagine wide worlds while playing things like Tomb Raider 2.  As an adult, I know there's "nothing there" but as a kid, you didn't know games had limitations, especially before the internet.

I miss impossible rumors like "every person you fight is an actual person somewhere playing too!" or "if you collect all 35 1/35 soldier, they come alive and kill Sephiroth before he stabs Aerith!"
            Okay no, it’s definitely 1998 if that’s the case. That’s damn near unbeatable.
                It actually gets better...  


OP missed:   
Mario Party, Rainbow Six, Xenogears, and Rogue Squadron among others.
                1997 was better for me.

Diablo, Final Fantasy 7, Castlevania SOTN, Blood, MDK, Harvest Moon, Final Fantasy Tactics, Star Fox 64, GoldenEye 007, Oddworld, Fallout, Jedi Knight: Dark Forces 2, Age of Empires, Blade Runner, Quake 2 and Gran Tourismo.
                    1994 gets no love, but was pretty amazing as well.

Sonic the Hedgehog 3, X-COM: UFO Defense, Super Metroid, The Elder Scrolls: Arena, Final Fantasy VI, Magic Carpet, TIE Fighter, Earthworm Jim, The King of Fighters '94, EarthBound, The Need for Speed, Master of Magic, Mortal Kombat II, System Shock, Doom II, Sonic & Knuckles, Killer Instinct, Warcraft: Orcs & Humans, Donkey Kong Country, King's Quest VII: The Princeless Bride, Wing Commander III: Heart of the Tiger, Tekken, King's Field, Marathon, Heretic
2017 had Super Mario Odyssey, Zelda Breath of the Wild, Persona 5, Nier:Automata, Horizon Zero Dawn,  Resident Evil 7, Cuphead, Nioh, What Remains of Edith Finch, Wolfenstein II, Undertale, to name a few.
You snuck that one in there didn't you
    Yeah Zelda barely squeezed in.
You forgot Hogwarts Legacy and Baldurs Gate 3. Absolutely nutty year.
    I really enjoyed dead island 2. The video game equivalent of a really well executed B movie with great gore and visuals
Tokyo Game Show in September! That's where Rise was revealed.
It's almost guaranteed to be revealed at TGS, they straight up said to monster hunter fans "to look forward to TGS 2023"
I suspect it might still be a while since it might seem too similar to Dragon’s Dogma 2. I was hopeful too but I think world 2 gets announced closer to DD2 release
To be fair, Burning Shores is a damned good DLC.
It's great for people who might need to take a break from playing and come back in a couple weeks and not remember everything in the story. And it cuts down on boring exposition for everyone.
    It’s also great for folks like me that generally steer clear of high fantasy because of all the made up regions, names, supernatural elements, etc. sounding similar and being confusing. Such a great feature
By the time I hit the DQ11 demo stopping point I felt obligated to buy it cause I had so much time put in already lol
    It's funny since I had the exact opposite reaction. There was a time when I'd be all over that JRPG comfort food but playing the demo made me realise I've probably done it too many times, and I've moved on so it didn't make me want more (I stopped before the end). But I think overall it could only have helped them find more sales so it was still a good idea to release it.
I wasn’t 100% confident as I could only definitely remember every FF game but you’re absolutely right. Square Enix has always had this practice.
Honestly still surprised It Takes Two won over: 

* Deathloop
* Metroid Dread
* Psychonauts 2
* PS5 Ratchet & Clank
* Resident Evil 8
* Returnal

ITT wasn't even the best reviewed game of that year and yet somehow won GotY.
    Reviewers liked it but the player base LOVED it. It probably deserved to win
    Returnal should have won imo.
    Other than Metroid Dread, I think the rest were like 8/10 games... I think that was a pretty weak year tbh
2014 had Bayonetta 2, Mario Kart 8, Shovel Knight, Divinity Original Sin, Dark Souls 2, Smash 3DS/Wii U, and Alien Isolation too

It wasn’t a great year in the grand scheme of things, but there were games to be played for sure
Inquisition was great though. It's by far the most lore dense entry in the series. 

There were certainly some missteps (timed war table, the first area being garbage) but it was a great game as long as you weren't expecting Origins 2.
    I found Inquisition painfully mediocre in every way. Everything it did, Witcher 3 did a million times better a year later.
Hi-Fi is not an indie, it was developed by Tango Gameworks who are a Zenimax studio.

Definitely a smaller budget title (that is incredible) but they are not an indie studio.

But yeh with you, would love to hear a medley of songs from Hi-Fi, that would be fucking awesome lmao
Super Mario Bros. Wonder **AND** the most unexpected thing, a 3D Remake of Super Mario RPG.  My jaw dropped.
I just saw those, 2023 is a certified classic
Yeah, and honestly a few beans quests are actually good for the game in the long run I think. Makes the really good one stand out over the 'meh' ones.
Very much. Obviously theres stagger, but if you pull big combos even when they're not staggered, they can't really do anything until you're done them lol. Very empowering if you can master them.
Probably because the game also doesn't demand that from the player.
    I just beat FF8 again last year. I kid you not I didn't use an ability outside of attack or limit break for the first 30 hours.
        Yeah FF8 has the air of complexity but it's incredibly basic and none of it is at all necessary to complete the game.
            FF8 is legit my all time favourite game, but once you figure out how to cure-refine tents into curaga on disc 1 it is over.
                Nah, getting Curagas from tents is nice, but the thing that breaks the game is realizing that Abyss Worm cards refine into Windmills which refine into Tornadoes.  Those will give you OP strength until the mid-game and by the mid-game you can easily get more upgrades.

Not to mention Disc 1 Lionheart, and general limit break spam.
        Yea, you just spam Aura on Squall and Renzokuken your way from disk 1 to the end of disk 4.
            Haha yeah aura is that one non-limit break ability you cast...because it lets you cast more limits. Occasionally haste too. Ya know. More limits faster. Love the game but it feels like they literally never even gave it a single balancing pass.
I don't know how adult me would feel about them, but back in the day I wouldn't say the optional bosses were that easy. Of course if you look up online where to find the best weapons, limit breaks and materia you can make them fairly trivial, but I'm talking about just playing the game blind.
    That's for sure. You can cheese basically any encounter if you look it up. I do recall child me struggling with the weapons.
    The optional bosses were the only parts that had any incentive on actually using the systems, but they were also designed around selling you the Ultimania guides, that was SquareSoft's MTX back in the day, so they were basically never fair but hard, just hard with almost no way of truly figuring them out without the guide
        Fighting Emerald with no knowledge of materia for Underwater breathing.
Oh I agree. I’m just saying JRPGs dont need crazy mechanical depth to be enjoyable. I like CT as much now as I did then. The game is just a vehicle for the story
Yeah. The general tone of FF games prior kept me away from them. I played the NES and SNES ones as a kid, but never got much into anything after VI except Tactics. Seeing a trailer for the story then playing the demo had be very interested. I was just waiting for reviews to see if that tone and quality carried on for the full game and now I'm waiting for this pre-order download.
    If you love tactics then you'll love this. The devs pretty much worship FFT with XIV having a whole mini arc with the characters and locations. I expect XVI will be the same.

Fun fact: The main characters kingdom Rozaria is a reference to the offscreen rival kingdom in FFT.
This is indeed what you get basically.
    Nice 👍
That's what they're saying - this game focuses on the primary protagonist while most previous FF games split the story focus among the party.
    Wow, I completely misread that, thought you were saying the opposite 😅
FFXIV at its core is still a light hearted game though. I haven’t played or even looked much at FFXVI, but it may be that it’s gritty and dark all the time which would be a change of pace for this series.
    read that there were plenty of lighthearted moments in one review
and then they go and (EW Spoilers) >!Goomba stomp a kid in front of his dad right on screen. God that entire Final Days section was just brutal!<
Honestly this is pretty much in line with most of the Ivalice world games. I know they rarely show up in the mainline titles, but a lot of the narrative feels very comparable to FF Tactics or Vagrant Story.
> That to, at times. But more about, *I am worried about spoilers here sorry and we can't say a ton*, but the timeline changes and back and forth and who has done what where and what MIGHT be a cutscene turns into gameplay an stuff like that.
Cant dive into it much more than that.
    At the very least it sounds like an interesting approach
        It is for sure. I liked the slightly Game of thrones darker tones.
> 12 was divisive because the world wasn't ready for it yet.

Hi, its me, I'm the problem its me. Granted I was like 14 when it released, I hated the mechanics. It wasn't until revisiting it a few years ago that I truly appreciated it.
FFXII suffered by making Vaan the main character, for good reason. God he was annoying.

Also the gambit system would be niche today, it wasn't just ahead of its time, it straight up will never be for everyone, and that's okay.  Personally it is my least favourite battle system in the franchise besides 15s half-assed action approach. For perspective, my favourite is VII-Rs system, followed by X and XIII. I don't have issues with ATB either.

And like you said, the early game is so messy that it turns a lot of people off.
    Vaan and Penelo were garbage characters and dragged down the experience and the story. The ending was also half-baked.

I personally loved the gambit system but can see why it's not for everyone.
        You can tell the developer was afraid of having an older character as the main character for a final fantasy, so they created Vaan who is pretty unimportant to the story.
Final Fantasy XII was the first FF game I played and the most appealing to me. I was extremely disappointed when the 13th part was not even close in gameplay to the previous game.
    I still love FF13’s combat system. It takes way too long to unlock Paradigms but once you do it becomes an extremely engaging balancing act. Shame about the level design though.
and you have to be *hella dedicated* to get through ARR tbh

Took me 5 tries over years before finally sticking with it.
    Yeah I've tried twice now. Never make it past level 20 or so. Really wanna get to the "great stories" later on but I literally am falling asleep when I try to play through ARR X_X
14 is terrible for exploration but in the exact opposite direction 

Starting with HW and areas designed with flying in mind every single area is just a giant open bowl with absolutely nothing of value inside it
The story of the sidequests is usually good. The gameplay...is not.
Callisto is such a bad game lol. It’s like they modded one section of dead space and you keep redoing that spot 1000 times
I absolutely love Ghostwire (I’ve 100%ed it twice) but even I think that sounds like quite the take based on the FF16 demo.
Not that weird, Tales of Arise is superb.
    I first half of Tales of Arise is superb, the latter portions I found to be less so (not much less, but still less).
    >Tales of Arise is superb.

Is it? I thought it was average. Xenoblade 3 that came out not long after was far superior.
I feel like most of the time technical issues are left out of the review score and instead are mentioned as a warning separate from it. I mean, look at the review scores of highly buggy (at lunch) games like cyberpunk, Witcher, Skyrim etc.

When a buggy game gets bad review scores then it's usually because the critics aren't a big fan of the game to begin with (forspoken, fallout 76 at launch etc)
[removed]
I don't think the Eikon battles are gonna happen often enough for you to be able to grasp a completely new and varied moveset.
Probably because it's a waste of time and resource to develop a complex mechanics for something that you do for maybe 7 times in the whole game.
    Every fight will be different mechanically too IIRC
You can't make slavery a complex at all subject because morally it's wrong and the moment you even try to justify it economically or culturally it's gonna be a PR shitshow.
I don’t think its that outlandish for Clive to realize its wrong later in life. Dude grew up as a child soldier in a world where slavery is literally the only thing keeping these nations functioning.
    Well, there are two things here.

First, in-game, Clive is already visibly uncomfortable with slavery as a child and then literally sold into slavery. It may be hard to square this with a realize slavery is wrong plot, which Gita notes.

Second, the criticism isn't necessarily that the plot doesn't make sense, it's a criticism of the plot the writers chose. The game can justify an MC realizing slavery is wrong but the writers still had to decide that was the story they wanted to tell and Gita clearly finds that story pretty boring and tired.
    True, but it doesn't change the fact that "slavery is bad" isn't a complex topic to tackle. I get that in the world of FF16 that may be an incredible revelation, but in storytelling in general, that isn't some great narrative feat.
        Who says it’s an incredible revelation? It comes in the first 3 hours of the game when Clive gets to the hideout.  It’s a 30 hour rpg.
    Not only that - he grew up as a son of the ruler (even if not chosed to be the Dominant), so his grew up as part of a royalty and not common folk. 

And even then, in the prologue he treats branded man just like any other person, so he has a kind heart
    A story having a good internal logic doesn't automatically make the story good, or make it not trite. It can both be true that Clive thinking slavery okay for a time makes sense for him and the world and the story of any character thinking slavery was okay is lame by the standards of today. Look at Avatar 1. That director puts his foot into the worldbuilding, it's kind of insane, and ~~people loved that movie~~ it made an equally insane amount of money. It's still FernGully. Or The Last Samurai. Or the older movies I can't remember.
        [Dan Olson made a really good video about this that he calls the "Thermian Argument"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxV8gAGmbtk). Alternatively known as Watsonian perspective.
            I'm a Folding Ideas fan but I've never seen this video. Thanks, this is everything I mean, and surely what Polygon's talking about.
Clive grew up a spoiled lordling, it's not a far step.

Rich people live in bubbles, I think it's pretty accurate. 

I know it's a joke but 'what could a banana cost? 10 dollars?' comes to mind.
    It might make sense logically, but that doesn't make it any more interesting. "Privileged man realizes slavery bad" is a very well-worn arc that often comes off as dull and pointless unless the story has something new to say.

No idea how well it plays out in-game, haven't played it, but feeling it chose a tired premise and did nothing with it is valid criticism for a story-focused game.
Eh most plot hooks can sound weak and like something that's been done countless times already if you try to summarise it in one sentence.

Don't misunderstand I'm not saying whether FF XVI story is great/bad because I obviously haven't played the game already. I'm only saying, just because the plot hook have been done already, doesn't make it bad. It's the execution that matters.

For example "A good man turns bad due to life circumstances" is something that's been done countless times before and sounds tiring as fuck, but that doesn't change the fact that Breaking Bad is one of the best shows of all time and Walt's slowly becoming more and more fucked up with each season is a joy to follow.
    Sure, the game could be great, and most reviews are super positive on the story. I’m more noting that the criticism from Polygon is very understandable and not absurd, especially since it doesn’t even affect the precious metascore. People having very different takes and tastes than others isn't always a sign of bad faith or whatever.
No fist clench?
Some people just hyperfixate on the things they hate about gaming. I think it's just because hate is great for algorithmic content filters. So all they see is the worst stuff.

And maybe some of it is just the churn of people burning out. It's a hobby like any other and plenty of people get tired after a while.

Totally agree though, it's so packed that I'm skipping games I want to play because I just don't have the time ;-;
    > I think it's just because hate is great for algorithmic content filters. So all they see is the worst stuff.

Half that, and half that the human brain is wired in such a way that negative experiences stick around more than positive ones. So its a bad feedback loop between the two all around.
The difference I think is largely in frequency. This is a great year. But how often we get great years seems spaced further out.
undertale was 2015
Let's not forget Prey!
Undertale is older than that no? Great year though. I still need to go back and beat Nier
This year is already beating 2017 for me personally
How about 2020? New Horizons, Doom Eternal, Hades, Persona 5 Royal, FF7 Remake, TLOU2, Half-Life Alyx, Demon's Souls, Spider-Man Miles Morales, Microsoft Flight Simulator, Yakuza Like a Dragon, Ori and the Will of the Wisps, 13 Sentinels, Ghost of Tsushima, Genshin Impact, Cyberpunk (okay, it's debatable, but it has its fans), and more.
2011 was good, no? (Skyrim, Arkham City, MW3, Dark Souls, Battlefield 3, Portal 2, Uncharted 3)
    2017 as well
        Yeah, 2017 was just an insane year.
        [deleted]
            [deleted]
        Horizon: Zero Dawn, Nier: Automata and Persona 5 all within a few months of each other (in the west at least). 2017 was great
            So was Breath of the Wild. Horizon has consistently come out at bad times. First game was a week before BotW. Second game came out a week before Elden Ring.
                How could I miss BotW. Spring 2017 was on fire.
    Kinda stops there though. The reason why this year is the best in awhile is because the games are good, they're mostly all beloved franchises, and there's just sooooooo many. The list of released games this year is enough to stand against 2007 for me, and we're only halfway through the year
        Off the top of my head, 2007 had Halo 3, CoD 4, Mass Effect, Assassin's Creed, Rock Band, GH3, Bioshock, AND Orange Box. I'm sure there are more that I missed, but to me, it's still the GOAT year
            [deleted]
                Supreme Commander released in 2007 as well, incredible RTS
            Burning Crusade, Crysis, Uncharted, STALKER, God of War 2, Metroid Prime 3, Super Mario Galaxy.

What a fantastic year. I started out with Burning Crusade in January, picked up Bioshock and Orange Box in the middle, and ended with Halo 3, Mass Effect, and CoD 4. That's my personal favorite year for sure.
    Yeah, that was a great year too. But a lot of huge IPs started in 2007.
    Forgot Deus Ex: Human Revolution, The Witcher 2 and LA Noire.

2010 was almost as good IMO: Mass Effect 2, Fallout New Vegas, Bad Company 2, AC: Brotherhood, Starcraft 2, BLOPS 1, NFS Hot Pursuit, Alan Wake. Was an absolutely insane two-year period
It’s hard to picture a year more stacked than 2007, but this year definitely feels close.
    1998 is pretty famous. You had Ocarina of Time, F-Zero X, Metal Gear Solid, Resident Evil 2, Sonic Adventure, Banjo-Kazooie, Spyro the Dragon, StarCraft, Pokemon Red and Blue (in North America), Half-Life, Grim Fandango, Thief, Baldur's Gate.

That year was insane.
        it was doubly insane considering a lot of us were little kids for it.  I still miss when I could imagine wide worlds while playing things like Tomb Raider 2.  As an adult, I know there's "nothing there" but as a kid, you didn't know games had limitations, especially before the internet.

I miss impossible rumors like "every person you fight is an actual person somewhere playing too!" or "if you collect all 35 1/35 soldier, they come alive and kill Sephiroth before he stabs Aerith!"
        Okay no, it’s definitely 1998 if that’s the case. That’s damn near unbeatable.
            It actually gets better...  


OP missed:   
Mario Party, Rainbow Six, Xenogears, and Rogue Squadron among others.
            1997 was better for me.

Diablo, Final Fantasy 7, Castlevania SOTN, Blood, MDK, Harvest Moon, Final Fantasy Tactics, Star Fox 64, GoldenEye 007, Oddworld, Fallout, Jedi Knight: Dark Forces 2, Age of Empires, Blade Runner, Quake 2 and Gran Tourismo.
                1994 gets no love, but was pretty amazing as well.

Sonic the Hedgehog 3, X-COM: UFO Defense, Super Metroid, The Elder Scrolls: Arena, Final Fantasy VI, Magic Carpet, TIE Fighter, Earthworm Jim, The King of Fighters '94, EarthBound, The Need for Speed, Master of Magic, Mortal Kombat II, System Shock, Doom II, Sonic & Knuckles, Killer Instinct, Warcraft: Orcs & Humans, Donkey Kong Country, King's Quest VII: The Princeless Bride, Wing Commander III: Heart of the Tiger, Tekken, King's Field, Marathon, Heretic

2010 was almost as good IMO: Mass Effect 2, Fallout New Vegas, Bad Company 2, AC: Brotherhood, Starcraft 2, BLOPS 1, NFS Hot Pursuit, Alan Wake. Was an absolutely insane two-year period
1998 is pretty famous. You had Ocarina of Time, F-Zero X, Metal Gear Solid, Resident Evil 2, Sonic Adventure, Banjo-Kazooie, Spyro the Dragon, StarCraft, Pokemon Red and Blue (in North America), Half-Life, Grim Fandango, Thief, Baldur's Gate.

That year was insane.
    it was doubly insane considering a lot of us were little kids for it.  I still miss when I could imagine wide worlds while playing things like Tomb Raider 2.  As an adult, I know there's "nothing there" but as a kid, you didn't know games had limitations, especially before the internet.

I miss impossible rumors like "every person you fight is an actual person somewhere playing too!" or "if you collect all 35 1/35 soldier, they come alive and kill Sephiroth before he stabs Aerith!"
    Okay no, it’s definitely 1998 if that’s the case. That’s damn near unbeatable.
        It actually gets better...  


OP missed:   
Mario Party, Rainbow Six, Xenogears, and Rogue Squadron among others.
        1997 was better for me.

Diablo, Final Fantasy 7, Castlevania SOTN, Blood, MDK, Harvest Moon, Final Fantasy Tactics, Star Fox 64, GoldenEye 007, Oddworld, Fallout, Jedi Knight: Dark Forces 2, Age of Empires, Blade Runner, Quake 2 and Gran Tourismo.
            1994 gets no love, but was pretty amazing as well.

Sonic the Hedgehog 3, X-COM: UFO Defense, Super Metroid, The Elder Scrolls: Arena, Final Fantasy VI, Magic Carpet, TIE Fighter, Earthworm Jim, The King of Fighters '94, EarthBound, The Need for Speed, Master of Magic, Mortal Kombat II, System Shock, Doom II, Sonic & Knuckles, Killer Instinct, Warcraft: Orcs & Humans, Donkey Kong Country, King's Quest VII: The Princeless Bride, Wing Commander III: Heart of the Tiger, Tekken, King's Field, Marathon, Heretic
Yeah FF8 has the air of complexity but it's incredibly basic and none of it is at all necessary to complete the game.
    FF8 is legit my all time favourite game, but once you figure out how to cure-refine tents into curaga on disc 1 it is over.
        Nah, getting Curagas from tents is nice, but the thing that breaks the game is realizing that Abyss Worm cards refine into Windmills which refine into Tornadoes.  Those will give you OP strength until the mid-game and by the mid-game you can easily get more upgrades.

Not to mention Disc 1 Lionheart, and general limit break spam.
Yea, you just spam Aura on Squall and Renzokuken your way from disk 1 to the end of disk 4.
    Haha yeah aura is that one non-limit break ability you cast...because it lets you cast more limits. Occasionally haste too. Ya know. More limits faster. Love the game but it feels like they literally never even gave it a single balancing pass.
Fighting Emerald with no knowledge of materia for Underwater breathing.
It is for sure. I liked the slightly Game of thrones darker tones.
You can tell the developer was afraid of having an older character as the main character for a final fantasy, so they created Vaan who is pretty unimportant to the story.
Who says it’s an incredible revelation? It comes in the first 3 hours of the game when Clive gets to the hideout.  It’s a 30 hour rpg.
[Dan Olson made a really good video about this that he calls the "Thermian Argument"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxV8gAGmbtk). Alternatively known as Watsonian perspective.
    I'm a Folding Ideas fan but I've never seen this video. Thanks, this is everything I mean, and surely what Polygon's talking about.
Yeah, 2017 was just an insane year.

Horizon: Zero Dawn, Nier: Automata and Persona 5 all within a few months of each other (in the west at least). 2017 was great
    So was Breath of the Wild. Horizon has consistently come out at bad times. First game was a week before BotW. Second game came out a week before Elden Ring.
        How could I miss BotW. Spring 2017 was on fire.
Off the top of my head, 2007 had Halo 3, CoD 4, Mass Effect, Assassin's Creed, Rock Band, GH3, Bioshock, AND Orange Box. I'm sure there are more that I missed, but to me, it's still the GOAT year

        Supreme Commander released in 2007 as well, incredible RTS
    Burning Crusade, Crysis, Uncharted, STALKER, God of War 2, Metroid Prime 3, Super Mario Galaxy.

What a fantastic year. I started out with Burning Crusade in January, picked up Bioshock and Orange Box in the middle, and ended with Halo 3, Mass Effect, and CoD 4. That's my personal favorite year for sure.
