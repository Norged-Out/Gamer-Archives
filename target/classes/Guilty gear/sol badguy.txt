[[Sol Badguy]]





Ah, very nice, Asuka. Well played, in fact. I have, however, decided that I would prefer to win this round. I'm sure you understand.
    I fking read this in Dunkey's voice god damn
hmm today i shall approach sol badguy with pixel health and 50 meter. what could possibly go wrong?

    Literally this. Youre playing a zoner, you approached sol. Already stupid. You approached sol with bar. More stupid. You approached sol with meter as asuka without his mana based def boost. Even more so. And totop it all ofyou didnt even walk up and block. Lmao.
        Imo Asuka is way scarier when he puts you in the corner than in the other end of the screen
        he just tried to meaty jesus christ
            I mean yeah, the whole clip and post is geared to paint the sol player as someone who got free brainless damage.

When the event in question is a manaless asuka running up to meaty a sol with bar....hence my criticism. There was certainly a thoughtless act here.

EDIT: OP is sol, good job OP
    Lmaooo its prolly cause I kept messing up my dp inputs so he wasnt looking for reversalsðŸ˜‚ the true mindgame is being bad
        Would a reversal even beat TR here? idk how the ice spike behaves, i think youd just get clipped by the latter parts of it. Tho i didnt see it on your list, and you had no mana.

Not to say i dont get that that happens, a mental stack is a big deal, especially on a zoner, and ESPECIALLY on a zoner of this caliber.

I just wanted to point out that sol in fact did earn that round, since you unfortunately handed it to him.
            Oh I was on Sol haha I meant he wasnt expecting *my* reversal. Although, theoretically any reversal can beat another given its timed to i-frame the opponent's. In this case a properly timed dp would hit Sol between the first and second hit.
                Oh right between the hits, im a dingus. Also sry for the curtness. Congrats tho.

Bro got the fetty wap music dlc ðŸ’€
    It goes so hard bro

"YOU HAVE NO MANA...GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!"
Was gonna say "should've used that meter to regen mana" then I noticed THE WHOLE SECOND THEY COULD'VE SPENT CHARGING MANA WITHOUT MUCH RETALIATION FROM SOL
Lore-accurate
He needs it
Asuka would listen to fetty wap
I donâ€™t think this is lore accurate
That's why Sol is gonna be my main forever.
NOT EVEN CLOSE BABY

Can someone explain why he did so much damage? High guts? Iâ€™m like floor 7 but Iâ€™m still not that knowledgeable on the game
    The guts rating of a character means they get more defense the lower their health is. Its why when some characters are super low they just tend to just survive things. May, Chipp, and Anji are examples of characters with high guts, so more "health".

Defense modifier is a number which gives characters more or less "health" essentially. Chipp has a high defense modifier so he takes more damage.

Its pretty nuanced but essentially high guts = high health, and low defense modifier = high health.

Asuka without mana has no shield, and no shield Asuka has the lowest health in the game, 0 guts, and super high defense modifier. For this reason, Sol's super which already does like a billion damage does even more on him.
        Ah ok so itâ€™s an asuka thing lol
has the guilty gear a single player like M.O.M. from Rv2?

Idea, why don't we all just, not approach Sol at 50 tension, ***ever.***
When the zoner runs up to close slash completely disregarding Sol's resources. Ya love to see it.
ASUKA YOU JUST HAD TO HIT HIM OTG
