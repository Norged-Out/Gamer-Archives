[[Has Roman Cancelling ever been explained in universe]]


Guilty Gear has a lot of lore but I don't think Roman Cancel has ever been talked about.

Can it be applied outside of combat? Is it used in everyday life??? 




I can see it making canonical sense that bursts are just high density info spheres as seen in another story. Using a quick burst of magic to push people away and stop whatever you're doing.
    Hug me please

Shut up I burst
        only works before the command grab connects
    Its probably exactly that since they're called "psych burst"
    Can't only some people use magic in the GG universe? Not every character would be able to do it.
        Everyone can use magic in the guilty gear universe with practice. Some people have an affinity for certain types e.g. ki for Japanese people, but theoretically anyone can use any type. Everyone has some inherent ki and it can be inferred that it is why everyone on the roster has superhuman strength.

As for why every character uses bursts even when some don't use other spells it is probably because it is easier to just release some magic rather than structure it.
I wish I could Roman cancel in real life
    lmao this guy doesn't even know how to roman cancel in real life
        How tf do you build meter IRL?
            You hit people. Repeatedly. If you stop, you will get negative penalty.
                Also, sprint at them, full tilt.
                    Don‚Äôt listen to these people. I am now facing a class action lawsuit because I followed their instructions üôÅüòî
                        You did it wrong.
                        Well clearly you dropped the combo
                        *Negative Penalty!*
            The easiest way for me has been to start a fight with a small child and keep running at them until the meter is full.
                Just throw him into a window and gain positive bomus
                    Bursting in their face helps with the positive bonus too apparently
            Aggressively approaches people TENSION
            Walk forward
        I got Roman cancelled on Twitter.com
            jesus christ got roman cancelled once
    P K S H.S
        Not in this game, sir
    Would be great for escaping awkward situations
i dont think roman cancels are ever brought up in universe but its not a huge leap in logic to just assume its some kind of magic that the characters are just capable of given that its a science. Probably not used in everyday life since you probably have to have a great understanding of magic to use it and it takes a lot of energy (tension gauge) to do.
    but it's probably canon for I-no/Axl since they can manipulate time.
        Roman cancel me saying ‚Äúyou too‚Äù to the cashier when they tell me to enjoy my food.
    So how does Potemkin do it?
        He sniffed magic glue

        In the english dub of strive potemkin goes "second limiter release" during red RC so i'd guess its using energy from his power limiters like giganter kai
            Thanks!
‚Ä¶

PRC drift back instead of contraceptives

‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry
    You know you messed up the timing if you RRC
        So does the cum explode then?

Or does your penetrated partner fly 5 feet into the air?
            Oh she flies
                Into the ceiling fan
            Knocking upwards as they say
            Just wiff a normal so you get the short RRC
            They get launched for a combo
            You‚Äôre partner flys up but if you‚Äôve still got the stamina you can start dustlooping them
    At least we got it out of the way

do you care if along the way‚Äôs a little sacrifice?
            STRIKE BACK!
                GO EXCITED!
                    GET THEM OUT OF YOUR WAY!
    What if I PRCC into cum, can I shoot it on her afterwards? I didn't spend my meter yet so the special move should work
I imagine it's just a kind of commonplace low-level magic ability that fighters use in combat all the time. Easy to learn, hence the whole cast can do it. Same with FD, Burst, etc.
Same as air dash, common low level magic
    Wow, the air dash having that magic circle in the beginning of the animation adds so much to this.
Considering the fucked up things that happened in the GG lore, I'm not that surprised to learn that they canceled the Roman empire tbh
Power of love, baby

That's why it's a romantic cancel

RC is just The universal anime technique of time stopping while protagonist explaining their thought process and what‚Äôs going on in the battle
Lore wise, axl probably be the only one who could. And i-no. 

Time stop/slow bs is the couples schtick
It's just taunting that requires meter
My own headcanon is that it's like using magic to make the backyard reload a savestate of yourself from a second or two ago. Most of the time shenanigans are left to Axl and i-no, but it wouldn't be a stretch to say that the others could do it too, at least on a scale this small.
Obligatory deepest lore.

‚ÄúHey Ky check this out I can just stop my attack with magic‚Äù

‚ÄúGoddammit, Sol.‚Äù
Everyone commenting that it's a simple application of magic... how does Potemkin do it? People from Zepp can't use magic.
    Techno magic
    Magitech
can you Roman cancel mid sex to give yourself time to pull out
Axl and/or I-no are on the sidelines of the match and just go

"ah shit he stopped the move, that's a slowdown for like half a second or so"
It is called the Romantic Cancel (or at least X implies that it is its full title) so I'm going to imagine it has bed room applications
Yeah havent you ever considered you can roman cancel your way out of a conversation when it starts going south and wild rush out the door
No. It‚Äôs just a gameplay mechanic.
I think Axl has something to do with it
I genuinely don‚Äôt think Roman Cancels are canonical in story. Just a gameplay system, kinda like trying to explain Special Cancelling in the Street Fighter universe or Blue Sparks in the Tekken Universe
I always figured it was just like, a quick burst of adrenaline that makes you move really fast
You know, while we're on the subject, I've been wondering for a while, why is it even called "Roman Cancel"?
Can you imagine dropping a mug and then roman cancelling to pick it up and still failing
Oh shit I dropped my bread
*PRC intensifies*
No
Hug me please

Shut up I burst
    only works before the command grab connects
Its probably exactly that since they're called "psych burst"
Can't only some people use magic in the GG universe? Not every character would be able to do it.
    Everyone can use magic in the guilty gear universe with practice. Some people have an affinity for certain types e.g. ki for Japanese people, but theoretically anyone can use any type. Everyone has some inherent ki and it can be inferred that it is why everyone on the roster has superhuman strength.

As for why every character uses bursts even when some don't use other spells it is probably because it is easier to just release some magic rather than structure it.
