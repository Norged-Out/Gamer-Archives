[[Why is his name sol badguy]]


Got curious and wanted to know why he's named that.


He's a guilty gear
    perhaps he strives for something
        My favorite part of the Sol arc was when he XX Λ Core Plus R
            when the guilt gear overtured he peaked
                My favorite part was when he said “You should’ve read the Sign” and Revelated all over the bad guys
                    You think he did that for the xrd time?
                        Nah, but he surely enjoys to XX those guys
The government designated him "Badguy" after he destroyed a lot of their Gear research facilities.

Then Slayer found out about him and went, "Wow you're pretty cool, mister funny gunflame man. But why not make the sun part of your name, since you shine so brightly?"

So Frederick started calling himself "Sol Badguy", because he was a Guilty Gear who no longer felt worthy of using his real name.
    Or we go by the funny way. The name Frederick Bulsara is derived from the stage name and birth name of Freddie mercury. Fredrick being the long form of Freddie and Bulsara being Freddie Mercury’s birth last name (I say birth because he legally changed it). The name Badguy also comes from the fact that Freddie Mercury was sometimes referred to as “Mr. Badguy”. He also has many other Queen references too, go check the wiki
    Wasn't Kliff who gave him his name?
        No, it was Slayer under the pseudonym "Eripmavs D Yraid", which is an anagram for "D (The) Vampire's Diary".
            God dammit 

Did he unironically go by that name though?
                probably, knowing him
    I thought it was dr. paradigm that gave Sol his name?

Edit: corrected twice, wiki says it was slayer. Not sure how those two got mixed up lol.
        Paradigm was introduced in Overture.
            Could've sworn Xrd or rev had a moment in the story mode where paradigm narrates the story of giving Sol his name... its been a few years though so memory is fuzzy.

Edit: wiki says it was Slayer, not sure where I got Paradigm, maybe similar EN VAs? *shrugs*
                Dr. Paradigm needs to be in Strive

Same as every other character in the series, even if they were only in like one game

we need to give uMVC3 a run for its money in the roster

        Not unless there's a retcon I missed.

Paradigm didn't know who "Sol Badguy" was until he sent Izuna to find Frederick in Overture, then learned he was going by that name.
    in conclusion, he got that name because he was agressive terrorist and Freddie Merury reference
    I didn't see that anywhere yet, but I'm pretty sure the name "Sol" comes from the Latin music notation ( Italian/French/Spanish ) which corresponds to the note G ( A is La, B is Si, C is Do, and so on )


It makes sense, given how every names in the game are derived from music references, and what better name for the protagonist of the GG series name be the G note.


I'm really surprised this isn't referenced in the wiki, or previous conversations/topics


My response is a month late I know.
    I always thought the Sol part was a double entendre partly about how he feels isolated and lonely,to society he is the "sole badguy"
Because Daisuke thought it sounded cool.
    and he was correct!
the sol part of his name was suggested to him by slayer because his passion "shone like the sun", and he decided to take it. (sol = sun in many languages)

the badguy part, in universe was given to him by the government because he tore down many gear research facilities, but irl it comes from the freddy mercury single "mr. bad guy". sol's real name before becoming a gear was frederick bulsara (frederick = freddie, and bulsara was freddie mercury's original last name before he changed it to mercury)

daisuke is a huge queen fan as i'm sure you've noticed. other characters have such references to queen members as well, amongst many other rock bands.
    I’ve been a GG fan for a long time and I never noticed the Queen reference with Sol’s name!
        Did you notice that ROCK YOU on his head band is from WE WILL ROCK YOU?
            Oh. My. God.
                Also I’m fairly certain that Daisuke’s stated that Sol’s weird backwards sword grip is based on how Freddie Mercury would hold his mic stands while singing
                    It might be but I read that his blocking animation is how Sir Mercury would hold up a mic.
                Also Napalm Death and Order Sol's Instant Kill All Guns Blazing are song references/titles.
            His belt inscribed with “FREE” is from “I Want To Break Free”, another Queen song
[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr.\_Bad\_Guy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/mr._bad_guy)

Because of Freddie Mercury's first Solo album entitled Mr. Badguy. Daisuke is a fan of Queen.

Guilty Gear lore has lots of references to Rock music. From artists names, lyrics, albums and track titles.

    Mr Bad Guy

Bad me a Guy
        Bad me the Sol'est  


man car door gunflame
Sol Badguy
    Sol Badguy
        Sol Badguy
            Sol Badguy
                Sol Badguy
1. First name:Slayer named him that, no idea what it references though
2. Last name:He's based on freddie mercury and he has a song named "mr. badguy"
    Sol just references the sun, since his passion shone so brightly and shit.  
   
Badguy is also in-universe what the government designates him since they didn’t have his real name
        I guess Sol's first name is the G note in Latin music notation, but this is not referenced anywhere
Frederick Goodman is a scientist, not a creative writer.
slaye gave him the "sol" part cause he was so fucking cool or something, then he started bounty hunting and given he can blow up a mountain with general ease, he was pretty good at it, so much so that the people of the criminal underworld started calling him "badguy" cause thats kinda what he wss to them.
After the United States started weaponizing gear tech, he raided their bases. He never introduced himself, so they used the callsign badguy when talking about him. He liked it. 

Later, when he met Slayer and they had a friendly fist fight. After the fight slayer said he was like the sun(sol). 

That's how he got his name in the lore.
Same reason ppl are named Goodman irl
He is the sole bad guy
he has fire magic and hated himself
Because He is my shining ray of light that’s called the sun (sol) and he is badguy
Still waiting on the day we meet Luna Goodgal.
Someone said he fights like the sun so sol and the U.N I think gave him the name badguy after he did some stuff someone please elaborate it you know it's been a bit since I've seen the lore
    Slayer said he had the passion of the sun iirc
        ya that was it thank you
    The stuff he did to be called “bad guy” was blow up some government research facilities (they were making gears)
        Ah yes thank you
perhaps he strives for something
    My favorite part of the Sol arc was when he XX Λ Core Plus R
        when the guilt gear overtured he peaked
            My favorite part was when he said “You should’ve read the Sign” and Revelated all over the bad guys
                You think he did that for the xrd time?
                    Nah, but he surely enjoys to XX those guys
