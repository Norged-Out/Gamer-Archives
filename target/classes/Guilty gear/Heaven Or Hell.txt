[[Heaven or Hell]]





How I wish it were possible to skip or disable that without skipping the actual character intros...
    Somewhat relevant but I also wish I-No's intro wasn't 4 hours long lmao
        You're mistaken. I-no's intro should be longer.
            What would a arcsys game be without a Zamasu intro?
                *I am justice given form. I am the world. Now venerate the most noble, most splendid immortal, and supremely powerful god... ZAMASU!*
                They are necessary
                Wretched Mortals!
            Time spent looking at I-no is never wasted
                When I was young and played XX I mastered I-no just so I could see her go topless more
                    I played accent core for the first time a few months back and it was me and my friend's first time with gg as well and we started screaming when she took her top off. We down bad.
                        It was for a guilty gear character you are forgiven brother
                    Nice
            I meme that all ino mains think alike but the more I see the more it becomes reality.
        Fucking coolest intro though
    I don’t even know what they’re talking about lol
        They're saying that they wish that they could skip the "mankind knew that they could not change society, blah blah blah" part of the intro and still see the character intros.
            You mean the "Mankind knew that they could not change society, so instead of reflect on themselves they blame the beasts. HEAVEN OR HELL"

                    The doctor said 6 months, the clock says 90 seconds!
            … I don’t know what the mankind thing is talking about
                Oh. That's funny. It's just some shit about how humanity ruined themselves with an arms race over magic, created the gears, and almost destroyed themselves.

                    I'll need this refresher
                        Watched all four the other day, and its great. There is a lot there and it's still missing one from what I understand.
                            Yup rev's story
                            the 5th video is missing a lot. it's worth looking up more info.
                Japan is really anti-nuke. So I'm guessing its that but magic and gears
                    >Japan is really anti-nuke

I wonder why
                        Its a real head scratcher lul
                            I think it had something to do with pearls
                                I hear its a real crime to harbor them
Beast knew that they cannot change mankind.  
So instead of reflecting on themselves, they blamed the memes.

NICE COCK!
            This could be the intro to "Innocent Magic: Carefree"
    THE DNA OF THE SOUL
Does anyone know if ArcSys have some plans on improving character introduction cutscenes in future? Compared to the previous Xrd, Strive's character introduction cutscenes are pretty weak. It doesn't even starts with opponent introduction either.
    My thoughts as well. I really liked the banter before/after matches between characters. With it stripped, the game still has HELLA polish, but that's something I wish they didn't get rid of.
Guilty Gear and Bloodborne have the same plot
    Thought this was a BB meme before I saw the subreddit
Now this, this is perfect
fucking love this
The UI design and that... intro quote... are the only things of this latest installment that I heavily question with great critique.

*The doctor said I had 9 months; the clock says 90 seconds - HEAVEN OR HELL!*
Very good one!
Those damn beasts I'll make some gears!
Yes
I found this way too funny
Made me screech good job
Take your up arrow and get outta here.
would have been funnier without the "humans" text
please a option to disable it!!!! thanks
Stinkin beasts
WW3 IS UNDERWAY. RUSSIA IS ADVANCING TOWARDS CHINA. THE ICE CAPS ARE MELTING. SEA LEVELS ARE RISING. NUKES AT THE READY. ITS ARMAGEDDON BABY!

Time to die.

First homicide.

Knock yourself out!
