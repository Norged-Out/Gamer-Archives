Lets fking to yanking???
    Go*
        Hmm, I think he really meant that 🤨
        You can edit your comment, you know?
        also fucking*
    Let's what? 🧐
        be a hindrance to our team
        tragically overperform
    YANKING YANWINNING!! (inhales extreme copium)
    ''Live''
    I just saw that post
To be honest Yanqing was never Physical Mc/Arlan lvl at E0
    He wasn’t but his absurd team requirements and restrictions made him worse than phys mc.
        Yanqing before 2.1: "TASUKETE, GEPAAARD"
            Yanqing after 2.2: "I'm now a gambling man!"
            lol ye and gepard hates bronya
        Having been stuck with him since like 1.2 as my only ice DPS (I finally pulled Jingliu yesterday, so bye bye fuckquing) that's blatantly false and anyone who actually played him would confirm it.

He requires shielders only against enemies that spam AOE or DoT. For anything else you can deal with the loss in DPS. I 30* and 36* multiple MoCs thanks to him. He does his thing, and it's absolutely not on DH or Arlan level of power.

I've made 3* clears on MoC 11 and 4* clears on MoC 12 with him: and since this result varies dramatically with the level of investment of one's account, let's say that that's on par with my limited 5* DPSs, my Clara and my Qingque.
            Translation: "I had bad luck and got objectively the worst 5\* character in the game and now want to retcon their power level while people are high off a mediocre combo between them and Aventurine so I'll embellish the truth about how effective they work when they do take damage and act like 99% of the enemies in this game in MoC 11/12 don't have AoE".   

If your limited 5\*'s and Clara don't outperform your Yanqing it's not because Yanqing is good it's because you have zero investment into your other 5\*'s or don't know how to play them.
                That shows that you don't know the character.

Yanquing issue is not in power, but flexibility. He's not a character that can force content and has a very narrow niche, but in that niche he performs fine.

The point was always "he is not Arlan level". If I can chose between him and Clara in an encounter, I'd run Clara any day, but sometimes he was the best choice.

Putting this aside for a moment: him being so narrow and with little to offer besides the element and the multipliers really made him get old faster than any other character. I haven't been using him in the last two MoC because my account has enough alternatives and his niche is less existent than before.
                    Issue is his niche can’t take advantage of av advancers and needs sp+ supports w out aventurine

        Happy cake day
    Even Arlan is not bad, and Aventurine solves his most major issue, survivability.
He should be atleast C tier as well.
        No, Arlan is bad. He can be built usable, but he's bad.
            Full disclaimer, I haven't built Arlan, but at least from what I've seen he has notable strengths that he can play to; his main issue has always been the difficulty of actually keeping him alive at low HP to take advantage of his Talent, which Aventurine solves. Not consuming SP means he can comfortably use Skill twice with -1 SPD Bronya, the Talent's DMG boost is sizable, and he has a great multiplier on his Ultimate, especially with E6. I'm not expecting him to be limited character level, but I'd be surprised if he stays D tier.
            I literally never touched him cuz it'd be a waste of resources when I have, literally two of the best dps characters in the game
                There is a point in the game where, from that perspective, every resource you use is a waste because you already have enough. And that's not so far from where you are.
                    I didn't think like that, thanks!
                        Yeah at some point you'll pull just to get a different feel of the team, maybe I feel like using DoT, maybe FuA, maybe good old monoquantum QQ, maybe I feel lazy and just brute force with JL.

This eventually leads to trying out weaker 4* with busted supports lol
                            Ah, sweet!
                    That's quitter talk, every resource is valuable to increase by crit dmg by another 5%
            If he wasn't Lightning and saved on SP they'd be almost no scenarios where he could fit in as a niche. Sure, maybe we'll get MoC or PF where HP drain is good so if you don't have Blade or Jingliu (and Sam guessing from the lightcone in the shop) he could be used but...
                >If he wasn't Lightning and saved on SP

They give you Serval for free, that can keep a very high DPS on a skill-basic-basic rotation... I don't think there is any reason to build Arlan if not because you like him.
                    The saving SP and Self Damage could come up depending on MoC or challenges but yeah 99% of them time just go Serval
        Agreed. I got aventurine today and with the survivability I got from him, I was able to clear first half of MoC 12 with Arlan in 4 cycles.
        Survivability isn't even his major issue, it's simply that he doesn't do enough damage even without his downside.
        Survivabilty is one thing but damge is bigger of an issue
    I got him and clara 1st and 2nd for 5* pulls, so Clara's semi-taunt made him more palatable for me. Because of that, he was way better than Physcial MC for me.
        Yeah until 2.2 gave every elite a ton of AOE which is when he really fell off. Like the moment 2.2 launched he suddenly just felt unplayable compared to to just a day before because of the new enemies
            Did you mean 1.2? 2.2 isn't even out yet lol
                yeah 1.2. they added all the AOE shit then which DUMPSTERED him
    Agreed.


Im still waiting for hanya to be pushed down a tier.


Have her at E6 and shes aggressively mediocre. At 160 speed her ult gives 1 character less atk and speed than asta gives the whole team from her talent and ult.


Her mark only gives a 43% dmg buff (30 If not E6). While they are 5 stars S1Bronya or S1RuanMei give around 90%. 


Her sp gain from her mark is finicky and not that impactful.
        As a character that was supposed to be an SP battery she's just not that at all. A normal support with high speed and spamming basic attacks generates close to the same amount, while doing a lot more.
    Yes he was.
Aventurine is very good and 2nd floor is all weak to ice, so yeah, its understandable
    The lists are not based on current moc. They've changed that in like 1.6.

It says on the site that it doesn't take turbulences into account.
        Yanqings main Flaw was that he required a shielder to function, which only two before Aventurine existed and one was unviable 

Now the Aventruine is here Yanqing can now much more easily go off with a constant shielder that also oh so happened to get more shields if a FUA is done, which while not consistent Yanqing does have
        They were always basically a general tierlist anyway since their tierlist rankings are skewed by their own bias that goes contrary to their own data.
            Agreed. You just need to read the review sections and you can see the bias pretty clear.
                I've been reading a lot of comments about prydwens own bias in these lists, but are there any examples of those?
                    The evidence is that they rated *<X, my fav character>* as not a S+ unit.
                    Jing Yuan was one of the more extreme examples. There were multiple MOCs where his best teams, based on the clear time averages that Prywden posts in its own site, was at least part of the Top 3 DPS in clear times (even before Sparkle came out), and yet he was rated worse than other DPS for some reason.

edit: I am aware that rankings are not based on a specific MOC cycle. I am talking about average performance, not a specific cycle with buffs.
                        You’re literally replying to a thread that says Prydwen doesn’t base their tier list on individual MOCs.
                            Yes, but would not general performance over multiple MOC cycles be indicative of power level of a unit? Average performance indicates a trend. JY was never that low power level wise as the data across time suggested, which was my point.
                        afaik the tier lists are rated for e0 with f2p cones, is the MOC data also with e0/f2p cones?

edit: 

looks like the avg cycles only considers e0 characters yeah. at that point idk, I'd be interested in hearing the justification. they should do a better job at explaining the ratings if they have a tier list lol

how was jy rated? characters within a tier are alphabatized it seems
                            [deleted]
                                why do you assume acheron is rated with her sig in mind?
                                    If you look at Acheron's character page, you can view the LC assumptions they have on their damage calculations, where, Acheron is assumed to use an S5 version of a gacha LC (good night LC), or her signature LC. She is the only character with damage calcs in the Prywden website using gacha LCs that are not from the welfare Herta store/MOC shop.

I do acknowledge that this does not necessarily confirm that Prywden used the same LC assumptions for ranking purposes, but it at least shows that they are willing to make "special conditions" for certain characters that they don't do for others to hype them up. I actually personally have Acheron at E0 S1 and I know she's one of the few characters that fundamentally change without her signature.

Again, no hate on Prywden -- I would still say that they have useful guides, but just be careful in taking their rankings at face value. Take of that as you will.
                    QQ is the biggest example of this, she have nothing to do in the same tier than the like of Seele/JY/Ratio. 

Should be A tier maximum.
                    QQ in S tier is the most obvious example
    Doesn't Yanqing get fucked by Aventurine's dice phase tho?
        I’m guessing his follow up has smth to do with that
            His follow up only hits the same target so it’s still bad
                You can still get more than 9 points
                Hitting the same target still counts
                    If you NA on a character turn and someone else follows up (Kafka, Topass, etc.) what's the interaction like? Do both get the point? Only the person hitting?
                        It only counts for the one who's hitting the dice
                        The follow-up counts for the character who does it. So Kafka/Topaz would get an additional roll there
        freeze hard counters him since it prevents the betting phase from activating
    In that case misha should be 2 tiers higher
Sushang not here because she is chilling in SSS+++
    She's in the specialist tier for breaker rather than the DPS tier, but with Ruan Mei it's hilarious how fast she deletes physical toughness bars.
        Have you seen Misha's ultimate with ruan mei on a single enemy?
            Everyday I’m sad I don’t have Misha. I want the funny freeze shenanigans too!
                Misha is (in my opinion) underated. His mechanics are fun to play and he has rng AoE and the less enemies there are, the more powerful his ultimate becomoes.
                    I feel like there are lots of 4*s like this. Xueyi has RNG with her followup, but if all three hits hit the same target (i.e. there is only one target) it's probably the most damage a 4-star can do currently. I forget if its a trace or eidolon but it can also have universal weakness depletion so if all three hits land the same target, it'll do a lot of weakness damage as well. 

Asta is the same way. Her fire break against a single target is pretty much unmatched, and Sampo too.
                        4* are the queens and kings of "i could be SO good if i land my rng attack"
                            If yanqings followup is 100% chance instead too
                        Everyone with this attack jumping abilities are so good
                        Xueyi's E2, and the E1 adds 40% to each hit of her follow up.

So it's 130%x3 that heals 5%, reduces anyone's toughness, and gets buffed by Xueyi's "1:1 Break to DMG%" up to 240%.
                        That would be true if QQ didn’t exist, haha… the queen of the highest ceilings and lowest floors
                            Very rng dependent tho.
                                Just be lucky (Reset the fight until it happens)
                            If her FUA triggered on every attack she would be S+ tier.
                    He is basically 4 star JY
                You could get him from the Vignette in a Cup event if you haven't yet. If you still didn't pick him then who'd you get from it?
                    Xueyi
                        Still a great choice! She works great in Pure Fiction with anyone who can provide the stacks.
                Misha is so fun for remembrance runs in SU
        Is she that good at breaking? I have her, I might as well as build her, since she is so good in HI3
            She does some of the highest toughness damage in the game and also doesn't consume SP on her skill if she attacks a weakness broken target making her a really weirdly unique but effective breaker DPS. But be warned that it's only single target and ofc only against physical weak breakbars, so this makes her a lot more niche in practice.
                Good point. Still, for physical weak bosses, with Gallapher and Ruan Mei, I bet she will shine. Also kind of funny if I use Bronya with her for free skills 2x/turn.
                    Wouldn't Luka be better to use instead of Bronya? One of them with BE build while other one have standard build.
                Would you go break effect on her or do you mean just in general using her to break enemy weaknesses? Because her E4 looks nice for a BE build, but then I realize Luka exists. He is also single target with high toughness damage, but he can also detonate the bleed dot. So I'm always a bit lost on what Sushang's niche is suppose to be.
                    Her shtick is action advance, large self speed buff and the ability to build crit/BE hybrid, mostly. Generally these two fulfill a similar role but for different teams, with Luka being geared more towards dot teams and Su preferring hypercarry/crit comps so it's mostly down to gameplay preferences or what characters you have or want to build
        I've made a promise to build her in the event that I fail to pull yeehaw man whenever he comes out.
    E6 Sushang is actually really competent in MOC of the enemy is weak to physical, she can be run in a really sp-hungry team as well
        Sushang's kit in general is often very good for MoC/PF. In this turbulence for example, she can help stack. 

Similarly March has been swimming in season advantages for a while now. All her return fire counts towards the 6 stack. Her quick energy regen = lots of ults = stack shatter. She even contributes a bit on the follow up stacking in PF with the bird cage thing albeit her throughput isn't that great.
    Hanya + Sushang = SP positive if broken. Love it.
Oh good, I pulled one today, now he’s been upgraded from “don’t even bother” to “don’t even bother, situationally”
Yanking is just so good that he loops back from S tier to C tier 😎
Daddy Dan Heng and Mommy Himeko taking care of the 4 Express crew Hook, Misha, Yanqing and trouble child with the mind of an old overeducated Harvard lady, Herta.
    It's big bro Dan heng and mommy Himeko. Ain't no way he's half as adult as Himeko 💀

There is a difference between being an adult and acting like an adult.
        Current Dan Heng life experience isn't much but by chronological age he's by far the oldest crew member, he just gets lopped in with the amnesiac young adult gang (March, TB, why are y'all amnesiacs? Acheron foreshadowing?!)
            the teen team
        Dan Heng is older than himeko tho, by a lot.
        Dan Heng, not even Dan Feng, is centuries old. Dude is even more ancient than Welt.
        bro?? Isn't dan heng like 70+ in Vidyadhara years??
Maybe I realised it too late but all are in alphabetical order . Characters in Every tier

Misha s teir
Everyday moving closer to S tier
Every time I see Himeko in such memes I got to remind... well, first check actual list and then remind myself that it is MoC tier list indeed.
    she's incredible in MOC regardless, prydwen are just terrible at using anyone that's slightly less complicated than bladie unga bunga
        Extremely complicated character Himeko: uses skill every turn, ult when it's up, no specific teambuilding restrictions?
            having to break effectively(aka don't break both elites at once) to make sure that you get her follow ups as much as possible is the thing you have to worry about, which despite not being that much extra to worry about it makes the feelscrafters piss themselves, similarly to having to actually worry about skill order when using jing yuan  
"you have to mildly think when using this character in a strategy game therefore bad" is the motto of prydwen, they're untrustworthy to give accurate assessments, you can tell because they have a tier list to begin with, tiering characters when things are as situational as playing star rail's endgame is going to misinform players who don't know any better (such as a good chunk of this subreddit)
                Looks like you missed literally every single note on the tierlist stating how many factors play into it. (and also that 36* are possible regardless of tiers if you invested enough)

But even as someone who really likes FUA teams, Himeko is really bad in and non-AOE setting without Fire weaknesses. Replacing her with any actual blast or single-target character in MOC is usually going to be significantly better for your general damage. 

And no, Jing Yuan wasn’t considered "mid“ because he was more complicated to use, but because of the sheer amount of investment he needs to work decently, and how easily a single CC can completely fuck up your cycle, moreso than pretty much any other character with backloaded damage.
                JY is in S for both lists though??
                Jing Yuan is in S for both lists
        the refrain of the low-tier is always "they're incredible if you play them right," where "inrcredible" means "almost as strong as a high-tier" and "play them right" means "satisfy a bunch of extra and situational requirements that better characters don't have to worry about"
            The standard five stars all have some jank that makes them more difficult to play or less efficient than the limiteds, that's why they're permanent and not limited to begin with, that doesn't mean that they're necessarily bad though, and speaking of tiers in a game as complex with it's team building as star rail is disingenuous and hurts anyone learning the game at large as it will end up making people not build good characters because dickwipes are telling them that they're bad.  
Himeko's skill has roughly 72% of the MV of jingliu's enhanced skill but jingliu can only spend 60% of her turns doing that damage, and then has the follow up attack which is very easily spammable (in the situation of facing fire weak elites), plus grand duke and the 15% crit rate is really nice, not exactly comparable to the hp drain attack buff or the 50% CR from being in the buffed state and himeko gets a lot more out of facing fire weak opponents than jingliu gets out of ice weak, but facing weaknesses is the intention considering how your damage is just cut by 20% at least if you're not, and that's the only thing himeko has to worry about compared to "high-tiers", unless if you include the arduous task of breaking the two elites individually, unfortunately that's something this shit site considers as being a massive detriment and is complete bullshit.
        Come on man I like Himeko but in moc she does not remotely compare to the destruction carries and Acheron. You want a lot of breaks and you want them often so she's one of the best for pure fiction but moc, not so much. I already prefer Topaz against a fire weak side and once Firefly comes out it's completely over.
            fantastic idea, topaz and hime together, maybe with a ruan mei, or an asta if you made a bad decision like I did.  
all I'm saying is that my mediocre built himeko getting 50k per skill (in blast) with the only buff coming from asta, versus a similarly mediocre IL only getting 120k on a fulgurant leap with tingyun + hanya.  
can't compare my jingliu in good faith with her being e1 and with her sig so automatically getting a massive damage boost in single target and my blade is terrible so also not fair   
can't be assed to really do damage per round/rotation calculations for a full numbers comparison but if in my own experience she's able to compete with a similarly mid built IL then that's enough to tell me that she works perfectly fine.
        Himeko is objectively not good in MoC. The good MoC DPS units have damage multipliers that blow hers out of the water for 1-2 targets and they have massive self buffs she doesn't have to boot.                     

She's really good in PF though, so even if you're simped out I still dunno why you're upset people correctly say she isn't good in MoC. There are two end game modes and she's one of the best DPS for one of them, why's that not enough?
            She's got a blast attack, all the five star eruditions are essentially blast units(her skill which is only 80% of jingliu's single target attack and 66% of the damage to units on the sides, which is compensated by the ultimate and follow up attack's hits as well, (just to add on lightning lord is a blast attack and argenti's full ult is technically aoe into bounce but that usually ends up with the bounce hitting the big targets, therefore blast)

I'm upset because it's simple misinformation, slandering one of the standard characters for no good reason, opportunity cost isn't as big a factor in a game where you may not have all of the characters and she's great for fire weak opponents in moc. 

Not going to take anything about facing non fire weak enemies because the intention is for you to use characters against opponents weak to their elements, not something that should dictate the place on a tier list (tier lists are bad regardless), yes she's one of the best in PF, but she's also fantastic in MOC, anyone saying otherwise either didn't bother, didn't have a built enough himeko or are bad at the game.

the pricks at prydwen are a case of people bad at the game, evidenced by how they bumped up jing yuan after sparkle's release when he works perfectly with tingyun and asta, replacing asta with sparkle is a big buff but becuase asta needs you to consider when you use her skill, or god forsake how lightning lord dare not have a bronya buff, is asinine.
                JY definitely doesn't work perfectly with TY and Asta though. JY is extremely SP negative, Asta is extremely SP negative, Tingyun isn't even SP positive with JY because she has to use her skill more often than once per 3 turns due to JY's buff often needing a refresh while he's on one turn remaining to make sure the buff is still active when LL goes. Even running a fully SP positive sustain like Luocha doesn't make that team not run out of SP if the trio are all trying to play to their max potential. Yes you can just not Asta skill sometimes and let her buffs drop some in value and get less ults, and the team will do fine. But that's not the team working perfectly is it? You're literally making Asta perform worse than she can to make the team work at all, there's no world I'd call that perfect. Meanwhile Sparkle buffs more than Asta, has less buff overlap with TY, and is SP positive, and gives more effective speed stat to JY, so the team's issues all vanish while the strong points get stronger. Sparkle is a perfect solution to JY's problems and I think it's completely fair to say he's one of the units who benefited most from her addition.                   

Also, it's literally not misinformation. Himeko's multipliers are significantly lower than other DPS units in context of a mode where a team only has up to 5 cycles to clear a side assuming the other side's team is same strength, and she doesn't give herself any big buffs the way better MoC DPS units do. Idk, there's no way around that in spite of you acting like it's not significant, but it really is. Yes, if you invest in her to the max she can clear fire weak MoC comfortably, that doesn't make her "incredible" in any sense of the word, every single DPS in the game can be heavily invested in and clear MoC. Better DPS do not need to be well invested into to clear comfortably. You say there's no opportunity cost but there absolutely is, the opportunity cost is that it takes a long time to build units in this game and getting Himeko a great build aka having good gear is an RNG time sink that could take months. Every single DPS on the S or S+ tier of that tier list you hate give themselves some form of massive damage up/crit up/atk up/etc., be it through skills or ults or major traces, and it significantly decreases their reliance on being well built to perform.                   

Idk, seems like you just hate Prydwen and have a chip on your shoulder in general about people not wanting to hyper invest into units you like that aren't good in MoC. But tbh, no one cares that lower tier units can do well if invested in, and it only makes yourself unhappier to get so upset over it you're starting arguments with strangers online. Good luck with that in the future, hope my comment is useful in any way at all, I'm not gonna reply any more lol.
It's really too bad Yanqing doesn't have an eidolon that makes his follow up attack chance 100%. I feel like that would fix most of his issues in energy, damage, and utility and make him actually worth considering
    you mean, like what they did with Ratio's talent? It'd be crazy for it to take a talent + eidolon to just end up being Ratio's base talent LOL
Damn now arlans all alone
We're Yanqack
All memes aside… it does actually make sense.
so proud of him
lmao was gonna comment to defend green dan until seeing the yanqing and himeko
THE RETURN OF THE KING
I feel like i'm the only one that adores using Yanqing... he's in my team almost all the time lol
    What build do you use for him? I love yanqing but I never finished building him, and since I’m getting aventurine today it feels like as good a time as any to use him. 

I have his sig lc, just not sure about relics 🤔 when I check prydwen they recommend the debuff set for everyone these days and I’m already stuck farming that for ratio and Acheron so I don’t have extra pieces to give him lol
        Don't know about OP but I use 2pc/2pc atk% sets. The problem i see alot of people have for yanqing is that they don't build crit rate on him. He still wants like 40% so he's at 60% on while his talent is active and at 100% for his ultimate. I have 46/184 with him and its been pretty nice.

    Try me.
    He's just really obnoxious to use because he loses his buffs when he gets hit; and high MoC enemies hit hard, fast, and with AOE.
        I personally never have issues with him  but i guess it depends on the gameplay preference of each player
In my heart Misha is S+
    Wtf aint he like 12

Edit: if y'all dont know ofc im referring to username
        anytime I bring up how hsr players have a very high chance of being on a registry I get banned from the sub for a couple days
        it's unclear
        What do you mean?
            I think he's talking about your username
                We don't have his official age. And which kid works at a hotel?
                    he literally talks about how he will grow up one day, and is referred to as a child multiple times
                        So I was right about him being a kid 😭
                    Is a serious question? Kids in hotel where pretty common. That is what misha is, a lobby boy

                        But not nowadays, right? Or this still a thing?
                            Today not in developed countries. In some poor countries children with jobs are still a thing.
Also this is way more recent than you think my dad is 62 and he started working at an 5 star hotel at age 15 as a waiter.
                                Damn. Sounds hard
                                    That’s it? We established he absolutely is a child and is referred to as one multiple and you’re essentially like “dam… well anyways”.
                            Yeah but Penacony is very much modelled after the time period where they were common
                                Indeed penacony has strong 20s or 30s vives. Robin mic is also the very old style use in that time frame.

                                Thats a movie? Okay
                                    The other is a real picture. But this was common until the 1950s. I shared this picture because this movie os very well know and the best movie depiction of a lobby boy.
                        Exactly what I was waiting for following this trend lmao
                    Acts like a kid, talks a kid, looks like a kid, why even take a chance dude? This isn’t even talking about him literally talking about doing stuff *when he grows up* and he’s referred to as a child multiple times.
                    westerners have a real hard time dealing with the fact shotacons exist

I don't use Herta but I feel like I'll end up E6ing her with the amount of times I get her on banners and simulated universe 💀
    I mean if you do all the simulated universe stuff you get her to e5.
        E6 is bound to happen
    Everyones gonna get e6 herta probably, I think you can get e5 with the free copies alone lol
        e6, no? After the world 9 got released
            Nah, mine’s only at E5.
    I got her to E6 in 1.0 because she kept showing up on my standard banner pulls. She was a curse until 1.6 where she became a blessing.
This makes no sense. We already had gepard who could provide about as much shielding with more aggro. Only thing is less team damage since aventurine provides lots of buffs/debuffs for preservation...but that damage contribution applies to all the other damage dealers too so in a comparative tier list it makes no sense. 


I do think YQ was a little underrated before though. He was never amazing but he was the best semi f2p ice damage dealer if you happened to have a need for that. 


But the people who put this tier list together change something any time there is a logical assumption to regardless of the weight of its impact or if the logic is unsubstantiated.
Some character: /moves 1 position in tier list

  
HSR content creators: Whats up, back again with another video...
THE BOY IS UP!!
To Arlan: muahaha, I am the big brother now, call me Senior Brother!
Misha is criminally underrated against Aventurine.

Having control over ice LL is much more important than overall high damage per turn (like JL), in a sense he's like Acheron. The opposite would be like JY where it takes a lot of effort to not waste his damage on rolls.

Speaking of rolls, he also has burst (unlike YQ) to win the bet.
Misha is always my best ice warrior. I love him.

Wait. Himeko is ranked C in MOC ?? I usually 2-3 cycles with her, wtf
    Don't worry she will get even lower when Sam release
WHY IS HIMEKO SO LOW
Prydew aint cooking bro
    I assume it's MoC, where she is decidedly Not Great
        Ohhhh my bad😭😭
        I still think C is too low for her. She is at the very least B tier and still able to clear MoC 12 if she is against fire weak enemies
            [removed]
                Well that is why she is pretty good with Topaz. A Topaz, Himeko, Asta team is really solid. Topaz and Asta just delete toughness bars against single targets. Asta also buffs fire damage dps characters and when combined with Planetary Rendezvous + Penacony relic + Fire buff trace her buffing power is quite substantial. The only issue is that Ruan Mei is better than her. Even in the most perfect ideal scenario for Asta. Ruan Mei is just too absurd.
                    > Well that is why she is pretty good with Topaz.

So if she needs Topaz to be good, then it's not Himeko that is solid, but Topaz instead
                        but prydew doesn't care about this, look a kafka jumped to S+ with black swan, look a dhil  jumped to S+ with sparkle, look at yanqing jumped to C with aventurine...
                        Well I do not think Topaz is that amazing though. Some characters just synergize well with each other. They cover each other's weaknesses and work off each other abilities.
                            > Well I do not think Topaz is that amazing though. Some characters just synergize well with each other. They cover each other's weaknesses and work off each other abilities.

Except this entire thread is about a tier list that rates characters based mostly on their individual kits

And you are downplaying Topaz SO bad especially when she opens up multiple team compositions involving followup characters. If you think mono Fire or enabling Himeko is the only thing she can do, think again.
                                Never said she is only good for enabling Himeko. Also this is a team game. You can not just consider individual kits but their relationship with others as well as the content. Topaz is great in MoC but pales in comparison to Himeko in Pure Fiction.

For example [Himeko + Topaz](https://youtu.be/WPnx_7WM9Ag?t=62) is amazing against the Ebon Deer.

            Prydwen updates their tier list to current content. Current MOC has low fire weakness, ergo Himeko is ranked lower.
                Not since 1.6, its a generalist tier list now ignoring moc/pf buffs
                He lowered her position after the last Moc which was actually brutal for her. This one was pretty comfy for her
            It's based on usage rates sometimes sso lack of small mobs affected her latest standings
    It's moc
        Ohh mb😭😭
Someone explain what MoC stands for please

Where is this Tierlist from? :o
    Pryden's tier list
What's wrong with Himeko?
    I presume this tier list is about moc
        So what's wrong with Himeko in MOC?
            not a lot of damage, talent is hard to trigger if there aren’t a lot of fodder and just being generally outclassed
he needs to get buffs the way jy does every patch so he can become meta

Even dan Heng beat him 😂

fuck tier lists
Ayy right as I lose 50/50 to him on JL banner
I pulled him E2 instead of Aventurine and was shattered…
Somehow got Aventurine on the very next 10 pull!
i won't stand for this slander. yanqing +march 7th carried me through early game.
Ah lets go my 2 out of 3 legendaries are useless
My luck
    This is for MoC, Himeko is really good in Pure Fiction
Hook in C is blasphemy
nerf himeko

Yanqing is a small piece of garbage. This bastard fell to me instead of Aventurine

this tier list is so bad it's funny
Whats next???? At this rete they are going to let arlan out of the basement too
It would really help if you put the actual category this is even for in the title OP. This post has zero context.
At this point i trust their tier lists as i would ray charles to cook me supper.

THE HELL THEY DID TO MY HIMEKO 😡😡😡😡😡❗❗❗😡❗😡❗😡❗😡❗❗😡❗
    It's MoC stats not pure fiction tho C is kinda low but somewhat understandable
i didnt know it was april fools today damn
Is the lady from the banner that just left good? I got her yesterday and I don’t really understand the meta yet.
    She is, but she really needs two Nihility teammates and her personal LC is a massive upgrade.

If you just started the most realistic team for you is probably Acheron/Pela/Gui/Sustain.
        Toss in Gallagher as the sustain, decent chance they have him and he’s her best 4 star.
            I tried E6 Gallagher/Silver Wolf/Sparkle/E2S1 Acheron and couldn't keep the team alive in the current MoC12. Which is an outlier, but I'm not so hot on Gallagher as solo sustain.
                Oof. I heard it’s rough but doable with E2 Gallagher. I’d assume it would take a *lot* of investment though.

Natasha and Lynx aren’t going to heal that much better than Gallagher and he’s at least got a debuff.

Plus in all fairness, Floor 12 is probably out of touch for a newbie unless they cheese it super hard or get mad lucky with relics.
                    I'm not sure. I haven't busted out the calculator on this or anything, but since Gallagher's healing is directly tied to a debuff, enemies with very high speed will shed the mark and then he can't heal the team anymore outside of his skill. The MoC 12 boss on the second half has 160 speed, so keeping the mark up is hard (That's the example I'm going with, but any enemy with high speed or debuff cleanse like Cocolia is going to really hurt Gallagher's healing vs Natasha or Lynx)
    If you mean Acheron, yes, she's a very good as a damage dealer with high aoe and single target burst damage from her ultimate that ignores weakness types.
        Oh cool, I lucked out then!
Bailu takes the banner of being the worst 5 star and continues Qiqi's legacy

What  no cleanse does to a mf

Yanqing was more of a Keqing anyways
    Keqing got her revival with aggravate though. Yanqing revival in 3.0 inc?
        my goats from both games
    >Bailu takes the banner of being the worst 5 star and continues Qiqi's legacy

I disagree with that, cleanse is ridiculously overrated. Bailu has one of the best healing output, easily being able to sustain by only using her ult while Lynx with the same gear struggles. Bailu can even outheal most DoTs. So the only fight Bailu is bad in, are those with strong CC. But her healing output, damage reduction and revive still give her a niche. 

Compare that to Yanqing. He needs specific teammates to avoid getting hit. He gets 60% crit chance on ult, but it has an extremely high cost. So either you build him with 40% crit and don't deal damage outside of the ult turn, or you waste your ult buff. His kit just has fundamental problems that is not really fixable. And even when you jump through all those hoops, at best you end up with a single target Jingliu. Unlike Bailu, he just lacks a niche.
    Nah cleanse is overrated unless it's team wide 5 stacks of wind shear or you need someone's ult immediately imo 

I see people dying with healer only teams all the time, but I have never struggled to survive with Bailu. That and people treat her revive as an emergency button instead of a resource, if I have one teammate low and I still have my revive then I'm not wasting SP or a burst healing them lol

Yanking is atleast B tier cmonnn
What IF Himeko is E6? Where is ranked?
E6 he is surely B or even A tier right? Right? Please tell me my E6 is useful...
I call BS on rank C Himeko.
he needs to get buffs the way jy does every patch so he can become meta please hoyo
he needs to get buffs the way jy does every patch so he can become meta please hoyo please he deserves it
Hey.. himeko cant be down there :(
    Its MoC not PF.
        in any tier list. i just like running her even though i know she isn't the best unit.
            Well she is one of the best characters in PF. She just doesn’t have the raw damage for MoC so people rate her low there. She isn’t underrated its just MoC isn’t good for her kit.
                True. i just run her regardless as someone who won't bench her.
If this tier list is supposed to be based on the current MoC then Misha being C is just straight up a lie. He’s incredibly good for 12-2. He’s A tier for sure.
[deleted]
    Because this is tierlist for MOC?
Big whoop, every unit in that pic is still a worthless waste of resources.

YANKING YANWINNING!! (inhales extreme copium)
''Live''
I just saw that post
He wasn’t but his absurd team requirements and restrictions made him worse than phys mc.
    Yanqing before 2.1: "TASUKETE, GEPAAARD"
        Yanqing after 2.2: "I'm now a gambling man!"
        lol ye and gepard hates bronya
    Having been stuck with him since like 1.2 as my only ice DPS (I finally pulled Jingliu yesterday, so bye bye fuckquing) that's blatantly false and anyone who actually played him would confirm it.

He requires shielders only against enemies that spam AOE or DoT. For anything else you can deal with the loss in DPS. I 30* and 36* multiple MoCs thanks to him. He does his thing, and it's absolutely not on DH or Arlan level of power.

I've made 3* clears on MoC 11 and 4* clears on MoC 12 with him: and since this result varies dramatically with the level of investment of one's account, let's say that that's on par with my limited 5* DPSs, my Clara and my Qingque.
        Translation: "I had bad luck and got objectively the worst 5\* character in the game and now want to retcon their power level while people are high off a mediocre combo between them and Aventurine so I'll embellish the truth about how effective they work when they do take damage and act like 99% of the enemies in this game in MoC 11/12 don't have AoE".   

If your limited 5\*'s and Clara don't outperform your Yanqing it's not because Yanqing is good it's because you have zero investment into your other 5\*'s or don't know how to play them.
            That shows that you don't know the character.

Yanquing issue is not in power, but flexibility. He's not a character that can force content and has a very narrow niche, but in that niche he performs fine.

The point was always "he is not Arlan level". If I can chose between him and Clara in an encounter, I'd run Clara any day, but sometimes he was the best choice.

Putting this aside for a moment: him being so narrow and with little to offer besides the element and the multipliers really made him get old faster than any other character. I haven't been using him in the last two MoC because my account has enough alternatives and his niche is less existent than before.
                Issue is his niche can’t take advantage of av advancers and needs sp+ supports w out aventurine
[deleted]
    Happy cake day
Even Arlan is not bad, and Aventurine solves his most major issue, survivability.
He should be atleast C tier as well.
    No, Arlan is bad. He can be built usable, but he's bad.
        Full disclaimer, I haven't built Arlan, but at least from what I've seen he has notable strengths that he can play to; his main issue has always been the difficulty of actually keeping him alive at low HP to take advantage of his Talent, which Aventurine solves. Not consuming SP means he can comfortably use Skill twice with -1 SPD Bronya, the Talent's DMG boost is sizable, and he has a great multiplier on his Ultimate, especially with E6. I'm not expecting him to be limited character level, but I'd be surprised if he stays D tier.
        I literally never touched him cuz it'd be a waste of resources when I have, literally two of the best dps characters in the game
            There is a point in the game where, from that perspective, every resource you use is a waste because you already have enough. And that's not so far from where you are.
                I didn't think like that, thanks!
                    Yeah at some point you'll pull just to get a different feel of the team, maybe I feel like using DoT, maybe FuA, maybe good old monoquantum QQ, maybe I feel lazy and just brute force with JL.

This eventually leads to trying out weaker 4* with busted supports lol
                        Ah, sweet!
                That's quitter talk, every resource is valuable to increase by crit dmg by another 5%
        If he wasn't Lightning and saved on SP they'd be almost no scenarios where he could fit in as a niche. Sure, maybe we'll get MoC or PF where HP drain is good so if you don't have Blade or Jingliu (and Sam guessing from the lightcone in the shop) he could be used but...
            >If he wasn't Lightning and saved on SP

They give you Serval for free, that can keep a very high DPS on a skill-basic-basic rotation... I don't think there is any reason to build Arlan if not because you like him.
                The saving SP and Self Damage could come up depending on MoC or challenges but yeah 99% of them time just go Serval
    Agreed. I got aventurine today and with the survivability I got from him, I was able to clear first half of MoC 12 with Arlan in 4 cycles.
    Survivability isn't even his major issue, it's simply that he doesn't do enough damage even without his downside.
    Survivabilty is one thing but damge is bigger of an issue
I got him and clara 1st and 2nd for 5* pulls, so Clara's semi-taunt made him more palatable for me. Because of that, he was way better than Physcial MC for me.
    Yeah until 2.2 gave every elite a ton of AOE which is when he really fell off. Like the moment 2.2 launched he suddenly just felt unplayable compared to to just a day before because of the new enemies
        Did you mean 1.2? 2.2 isn't even out yet lol
            yeah 1.2. they added all the AOE shit then which DUMPSTERED him
Agreed.


Im still waiting for hanya to be pushed down a tier.


Have her at E6 and shes aggressively mediocre. At 160 speed her ult gives 1 character less atk and speed than asta gives the whole team from her talent and ult.


Her mark only gives a 43% dmg buff (30 If not E6). While they are 5 stars S1Bronya or S1RuanMei give around 90%. 


Her sp gain from her mark is finicky and not that impactful.
    As a character that was supposed to be an SP battery she's just not that at all. A normal support with high speed and spamming basic attacks generates close to the same amount, while doing a lot more.
Yes he was.
The lists are not based on current moc. They've changed that in like 1.6.

It says on the site that it doesn't take turbulences into account.
    Yanqings main Flaw was that he required a shielder to function, which only two before Aventurine existed and one was unviable 

Now the Aventruine is here Yanqing can now much more easily go off with a constant shielder that also oh so happened to get more shields if a FUA is done, which while not consistent Yanqing does have
    They were always basically a general tierlist anyway since their tierlist rankings are skewed by their own bias that goes contrary to their own data.
        Agreed. You just need to read the review sections and you can see the bias pretty clear.
            I've been reading a lot of comments about prydwens own bias in these lists, but are there any examples of those?
                The evidence is that they rated *<X, my fav character>* as not a S+ unit.
                Jing Yuan was one of the more extreme examples. There were multiple MOCs where his best teams, based on the clear time averages that Prywden posts in its own site, was at least part of the Top 3 DPS in clear times (even before Sparkle came out), and yet he was rated worse than other DPS for some reason.

edit: I am aware that rankings are not based on a specific MOC cycle. I am talking about average performance, not a specific cycle with buffs.
                    You’re literally replying to a thread that says Prydwen doesn’t base their tier list on individual MOCs.
                        Yes, but would not general performance over multiple MOC cycles be indicative of power level of a unit? Average performance indicates a trend. JY was never that low power level wise as the data across time suggested, which was my point.
                    afaik the tier lists are rated for e0 with f2p cones, is the MOC data also with e0/f2p cones?

edit: 

looks like the avg cycles only considers e0 characters yeah. at that point idk, I'd be interested in hearing the justification. they should do a better job at explaining the ratings if they have a tier list lol

how was jy rated? characters within a tier are alphabatized it seems
                        [deleted]
                            why do you assume acheron is rated with her sig in mind?
                                If you look at Acheron's character page, you can view the LC assumptions they have on their damage calculations, where, Acheron is assumed to use an S5 version of a gacha LC (good night LC), or her signature LC. She is the only character with damage calcs in the Prywden website using gacha LCs that are not from the welfare Herta store/MOC shop.

I do acknowledge that this does not necessarily confirm that Prywden used the same LC assumptions for ranking purposes, but it at least shows that they are willing to make "special conditions" for certain characters that they don't do for others to hype them up. I actually personally have Acheron at E0 S1 and I know she's one of the few characters that fundamentally change without her signature.

Again, no hate on Prywden -- I would still say that they have useful guides, but just be careful in taking their rankings at face value. Take of that as you will.
                QQ is the biggest example of this, she have nothing to do in the same tier than the like of Seele/JY/Ratio. 

Should be A tier maximum.
                QQ in S tier is the most obvious example
Doesn't Yanqing get fucked by Aventurine's dice phase tho?
    I’m guessing his follow up has smth to do with that
        His follow up only hits the same target so it’s still bad
            You can still get more than 9 points
            Hitting the same target still counts
                If you NA on a character turn and someone else follows up (Kafka, Topass, etc.) what's the interaction like? Do both get the point? Only the person hitting?
                    It only counts for the one who's hitting the dice
                    The follow-up counts for the character who does it. So Kafka/Topaz would get an additional roll there
    freeze hard counters him since it prevents the betting phase from activating
In that case misha should be 2 tiers higher
She's in the specialist tier for breaker rather than the DPS tier, but with Ruan Mei it's hilarious how fast she deletes physical toughness bars.
    Have you seen Misha's ultimate with ruan mei on a single enemy?
        Everyday I’m sad I don’t have Misha. I want the funny freeze shenanigans too!
            Misha is (in my opinion) underated. His mechanics are fun to play and he has rng AoE and the less enemies there are, the more powerful his ultimate becomoes.
                I feel like there are lots of 4*s like this. Xueyi has RNG with her followup, but if all three hits hit the same target (i.e. there is only one target) it's probably the most damage a 4-star can do currently. I forget if its a trace or eidolon but it can also have universal weakness depletion so if all three hits land the same target, it'll do a lot of weakness damage as well. 

Asta is the same way. Her fire break against a single target is pretty much unmatched, and Sampo too.
                    4* are the queens and kings of "i could be SO good if i land my rng attack"
                        If yanqings followup is 100% chance instead too
                    Everyone with this attack jumping abilities are so good
                    Xueyi's E2, and the E1 adds 40% to each hit of her follow up.

So it's 130%x3 that heals 5%, reduces anyone's toughness, and gets buffed by Xueyi's "1:1 Break to DMG%" up to 240%.
                    That would be true if QQ didn’t exist, haha… the queen of the highest ceilings and lowest floors
                        Very rng dependent tho.
                            Just be lucky (Reset the fight until it happens)
                        If her FUA triggered on every attack she would be S+ tier.
                He is basically 4 star JY
            You could get him from the Vignette in a Cup event if you haven't yet. If you still didn't pick him then who'd you get from it?
                Xueyi
                    Still a great choice! She works great in Pure Fiction with anyone who can provide the stacks.
            Misha is so fun for remembrance runs in SU
    Is she that good at breaking? I have her, I might as well as build her, since she is so good in HI3
        She does some of the highest toughness damage in the game and also doesn't consume SP on her skill if she attacks a weakness broken target making her a really weirdly unique but effective breaker DPS. But be warned that it's only single target and ofc only against physical weak breakbars, so this makes her a lot more niche in practice.
            Good point. Still, for physical weak bosses, with Gallapher and Ruan Mei, I bet she will shine. Also kind of funny if I use Bronya with her for free skills 2x/turn.
                Wouldn't Luka be better to use instead of Bronya? One of them with BE build while other one have standard build.
            Would you go break effect on her or do you mean just in general using her to break enemy weaknesses? Because her E4 looks nice for a BE build, but then I realize Luka exists. He is also single target with high toughness damage, but he can also detonate the bleed dot. So I'm always a bit lost on what Sushang's niche is suppose to be.
                Her shtick is action advance, large self speed buff and the ability to build crit/BE hybrid, mostly. Generally these two fulfill a similar role but for different teams, with Luka being geared more towards dot teams and Su preferring hypercarry/crit comps so it's mostly down to gameplay preferences or what characters you have or want to build
    I've made a promise to build her in the event that I fail to pull yeehaw man whenever he comes out.
E6 Sushang is actually really competent in MOC of the enemy is weak to physical, she can be run in a really sp-hungry team as well
    Sushang's kit in general is often very good for MoC/PF. In this turbulence for example, she can help stack. 

Similarly March has been swimming in season advantages for a while now. All her return fire counts towards the 6 stack. Her quick energy regen = lots of ults = stack shatter. She even contributes a bit on the follow up stacking in PF with the bird cage thing albeit her throughput isn't that great.
Hanya + Sushang = SP positive if broken. Love it.
It's big bro Dan heng and mommy Himeko. Ain't no way he's half as adult as Himeko 💀

There is a difference between being an adult and acting like an adult.
    Current Dan Heng life experience isn't much but by chronological age he's by far the oldest crew member, he just gets lopped in with the amnesiac young adult gang (March, TB, why are y'all amnesiacs? Acheron foreshadowing?!)
        the teen team
    Dan Heng is older than himeko tho, by a lot.
    Dan Heng, not even Dan Feng, is centuries old. Dude is even more ancient than Welt.
    bro?? Isn't dan heng like 70+ in Vidyadhara years??
I'm sorry for your loss 😟
    Already E1. From Limited and Standard.. but hey i still have my 300 picker

                        That's a really good one!
she's incredible in MOC regardless, prydwen are just terrible at using anyone that's slightly less complicated than bladie unga bunga
    Extremely complicated character Himeko: uses skill every turn, ult when it's up, no specific teambuilding restrictions?
        having to break effectively(aka don't break both elites at once) to make sure that you get her follow ups as much as possible is the thing you have to worry about, which despite not being that much extra to worry about it makes the feelscrafters piss themselves, similarly to having to actually worry about skill order when using jing yuan  
"you have to mildly think when using this character in a strategy game therefore bad" is the motto of prydwen, they're untrustworthy to give accurate assessments, you can tell because they have a tier list to begin with, tiering characters when things are as situational as playing star rail's endgame is going to misinform players who don't know any better (such as a good chunk of this subreddit)
            Looks like you missed literally every single note on the tierlist stating how many factors play into it. (and also that 36* are possible regardless of tiers if you invested enough)

But even as someone who really likes FUA teams, Himeko is really bad in and non-AOE setting without Fire weaknesses. Replacing her with any actual blast or single-target character in MOC is usually going to be significantly better for your general damage. 

And no, Jing Yuan wasn’t considered "mid“ because he was more complicated to use, but because of the sheer amount of investment he needs to work decently, and how easily a single CC can completely fuck up your cycle, moreso than pretty much any other character with backloaded damage.
            JY is in S for both lists though??
            Jing Yuan is in S for both lists
    the refrain of the low-tier is always "they're incredible if you play them right," where "inrcredible" means "almost as strong as a high-tier" and "play them right" means "satisfy a bunch of extra and situational requirements that better characters don't have to worry about"
        The standard five stars all have some jank that makes them more difficult to play or less efficient than the limiteds, that's why they're permanent and not limited to begin with, that doesn't mean that they're necessarily bad though, and speaking of tiers in a game as complex with it's team building as star rail is disingenuous and hurts anyone learning the game at large as it will end up making people not build good characters because dickwipes are telling them that they're bad.  
Himeko's skill has roughly 72% of the MV of jingliu's enhanced skill but jingliu can only spend 60% of her turns doing that damage, and then has the follow up attack which is very easily spammable (in the situation of facing fire weak elites), plus grand duke and the 15% crit rate is really nice, not exactly comparable to the hp drain attack buff or the 50% CR from being in the buffed state and himeko gets a lot more out of facing fire weak opponents than jingliu gets out of ice weak, but facing weaknesses is the intention considering how your damage is just cut by 20% at least if you're not, and that's the only thing himeko has to worry about compared to "high-tiers", unless if you include the arduous task of breaking the two elites individually, unfortunately that's something this shit site considers as being a massive detriment and is complete bullshit.
    Come on man I like Himeko but in moc she does not remotely compare to the destruction carries and Acheron. You want a lot of breaks and you want them often so she's one of the best for pure fiction but moc, not so much. I already prefer Topaz against a fire weak side and once Firefly comes out it's completely over.
        fantastic idea, topaz and hime together, maybe with a ruan mei, or an asta if you made a bad decision like I did.  
all I'm saying is that my mediocre built himeko getting 50k per skill (in blast) with the only buff coming from asta, versus a similarly mediocre IL only getting 120k on a fulgurant leap with tingyun + hanya.  
can't compare my jingliu in good faith with her being e1 and with her sig so automatically getting a massive damage boost in single target and my blade is terrible so also not fair   
can't be assed to really do damage per round/rotation calculations for a full numbers comparison but if in my own experience she's able to compete with a similarly mid built IL then that's enough to tell me that she works perfectly fine.
    Himeko is objectively not good in MoC. The good MoC DPS units have damage multipliers that blow hers out of the water for 1-2 targets and they have massive self buffs she doesn't have to boot.                     

She's really good in PF though, so even if you're simped out I still dunno why you're upset people correctly say she isn't good in MoC. There are two end game modes and she's one of the best DPS for one of them, why's that not enough?
        She's got a blast attack, all the five star eruditions are essentially blast units(her skill which is only 80% of jingliu's single target attack and 66% of the damage to units on the sides, which is compensated by the ultimate and follow up attack's hits as well, (just to add on lightning lord is a blast attack and argenti's full ult is technically aoe into bounce but that usually ends up with the bounce hitting the big targets, therefore blast)

I'm upset because it's simple misinformation, slandering one of the standard characters for no good reason, opportunity cost isn't as big a factor in a game where you may not have all of the characters and she's great for fire weak opponents in moc. 

Not going to take anything about facing non fire weak enemies because the intention is for you to use characters against opponents weak to their elements, not something that should dictate the place on a tier list (tier lists are bad regardless), yes she's one of the best in PF, but she's also fantastic in MOC, anyone saying otherwise either didn't bother, didn't have a built enough himeko or are bad at the game.

the pricks at prydwen are a case of people bad at the game, evidenced by how they bumped up jing yuan after sparkle's release when he works perfectly with tingyun and asta, replacing asta with sparkle is a big buff but becuase asta needs you to consider when you use her skill, or god forsake how lightning lord dare not have a bronya buff, is asinine.
            JY definitely doesn't work perfectly with TY and Asta though. JY is extremely SP negative, Asta is extremely SP negative, Tingyun isn't even SP positive with JY because she has to use her skill more often than once per 3 turns due to JY's buff often needing a refresh while he's on one turn remaining to make sure the buff is still active when LL goes. Even running a fully SP positive sustain like Luocha doesn't make that team not run out of SP if the trio are all trying to play to their max potential. Yes you can just not Asta skill sometimes and let her buffs drop some in value and get less ults, and the team will do fine. But that's not the team working perfectly is it? You're literally making Asta perform worse than she can to make the team work at all, there's no world I'd call that perfect. Meanwhile Sparkle buffs more than Asta, has less buff overlap with TY, and is SP positive, and gives more effective speed stat to JY, so the team's issues all vanish while the strong points get stronger. Sparkle is a perfect solution to JY's problems and I think it's completely fair to say he's one of the units who benefited most from her addition.                   

Also, it's literally not misinformation. Himeko's multipliers are significantly lower than other DPS units in context of a mode where a team only has up to 5 cycles to clear a side assuming the other side's team is same strength, and she doesn't give herself any big buffs the way better MoC DPS units do. Idk, there's no way around that in spite of you acting like it's not significant, but it really is. Yes, if you invest in her to the max she can clear fire weak MoC comfortably, that doesn't make her "incredible" in any sense of the word, every single DPS in the game can be heavily invested in and clear MoC. Better DPS do not need to be well invested into to clear comfortably. You say there's no opportunity cost but there absolutely is, the opportunity cost is that it takes a long time to build units in this game and getting Himeko a great build aka having good gear is an RNG time sink that could take months. Every single DPS on the S or S+ tier of that tier list you hate give themselves some form of massive damage up/crit up/atk up/etc., be it through skills or ults or major traces, and it significantly decreases their reliance on being well built to perform.                   

Idk, seems like you just hate Prydwen and have a chip on your shoulder in general about people not wanting to hyper invest into units you like that aren't good in MoC. But tbh, no one cares that lower tier units can do well if invested in, and it only makes yourself unhappier to get so upset over it you're starting arguments with strangers online. Good luck with that in the future, hope my comment is useful in any way at all, I'm not gonna reply any more lol.
you mean, like what they did with Ratio's talent? It'd be crazy for it to take a talent + eidolon to just end up being Ratio's base talent LOL
What build do you use for him? I love yanqing but I never finished building him, and since I’m getting aventurine today it feels like as good a time as any to use him. 

I have his sig lc, just not sure about relics 🤔 when I check prydwen they recommend the debuff set for everyone these days and I’m already stuck farming that for ratio and Acheron so I don’t have extra pieces to give him lol
    Don't know about OP but I use 2pc/2pc atk% sets. The problem i see alot of people have for yanqing is that they don't build crit rate on him. He still wants like 40% so he's at 60% on while his talent is active and at 100% for his ultimate. I have 46/184 with him and its been pretty nice.

Try me.
He's just really obnoxious to use because he loses his buffs when he gets hit; and high MoC enemies hit hard, fast, and with AOE.
    I personally never have issues with him  but i guess it depends on the gameplay preference of each player
Wtf aint he like 12

Edit: if y'all dont know ofc im referring to username

            We don't have his official age. And which kid works at a hotel?
                he literally talks about how he will grow up one day, and is referred to as a child multiple times
                    So I was right about him being a kid 😭
                Is a serious question? Kids in hotel where pretty common. That is what misha is, a lobby boy

                        Warning of what????
                    But not nowadays, right? Or this still a thing?
                        Today not in developed countries. In some poor countries children with jobs are still a thing.
Also this is way more recent than you think my dad is 62 and he started working at an 5 star hotel at age 15 as a waiter.
                            Damn. Sounds hard
                                That’s it? We established he absolutely is a child and is referred to as one multiple and you’re essentially like “dam… well anyways”.
                        Yeah but Penacony is very much modelled after the time period where they were common
                            Indeed penacony has strong 20s or 30s vives. Robin mic is also the very old style use in that time frame.

                                The other is a real picture. But this was common until the 1950s. I shared this picture because this movie os very well know and the best movie depiction of a lobby boy.
                    Exactly what I was waiting for following this trend lmao
                Acts like a kid, talks a kid, looks like a kid, why even take a chance dude? This isn’t even talking about him literally talking about doing stuff *when he grows up* and he’s referred to as a child multiple times.
                westerners have a real hard time dealing with the fact shotacons exist

                                Bro, it's a character. A Character. It doesn't matter if he's hurt, manipulated, killed or whatever, he is a bunch of lines animated with voicelines. Seriously what is wrong with u ppl
                            Nah, fuck pedophiles :)
                                Bro, are u seriously equating literal children for a fictional character? Uuuh no thanks...
        Bro cant handle Fembussy.
            Don't worry, Caterina will be playable some day
                I Will destroy that Hagussy when shes out.I really want to see more fanarts of her.
damn bro's username caused a whole ass war

I'm almost jealous
    Your profile picture could cause the same on other subs
        which is why i'm jealous because it actually doesn't get that much attention lol
            Now it got attention
same
Found the child toucher.
Relatable nick
I mean if you do all the simulated universe stuff you get her to e5.
    E6 is bound to happen
Everyones gonna get e6 herta probably, I think you can get e5 with the free copies alone lol
    e6, no? After the world 9 got released
        Nah, mine’s only at E5.
I got her to E6 in 1.0 because she kept showing up on my standard banner pulls. She was a curse until 1.6 where she became a blessing.
Don't worry she will get even lower when Sam release
I assume it's MoC, where she is decidedly Not Great
    Ohhhh my bad😭😭
    I still think C is too low for her. She is at the very least B tier and still able to clear MoC 12 if she is against fire weak enemies
        [removed]
            Well that is why she is pretty good with Topaz. A Topaz, Himeko, Asta team is really solid. Topaz and Asta just delete toughness bars against single targets. Asta also buffs fire damage dps characters and when combined with Planetary Rendezvous + Penacony relic + Fire buff trace her buffing power is quite substantial. The only issue is that Ruan Mei is better than her. Even in the most perfect ideal scenario for Asta. Ruan Mei is just too absurd.
                > Well that is why she is pretty good with Topaz.

So if she needs Topaz to be good, then it's not Himeko that is solid, but Topaz instead
                    but prydew doesn't care about this, look a kafka jumped to S+ with black swan, look a dhil  jumped to S+ with sparkle, look at yanqing jumped to C with aventurine...
                    Well I do not think Topaz is that amazing though. Some characters just synergize well with each other. They cover each other's weaknesses and work off each other abilities.
                        > Well I do not think Topaz is that amazing though. Some characters just synergize well with each other. They cover each other's weaknesses and work off each other abilities.

Except this entire thread is about a tier list that rates characters based mostly on their individual kits

And you are downplaying Topaz SO bad especially when she opens up multiple team compositions involving followup characters. If you think mono Fire or enabling Himeko is the only thing she can do, think again.
                            Never said she is only good for enabling Himeko. Also this is a team game. You can not just consider individual kits but their relationship with others as well as the content. Topaz is great in MoC but pales in comparison to Himeko in Pure Fiction.

For example [Himeko + Topaz](https://youtu.be/WPnx_7WM9Ag?t=62) is amazing against the Ebon Deer.

        Prydwen updates their tier list to current content. Current MOC has low fire weakness, ergo Himeko is ranked lower.
            Not since 1.6, its a generalist tier list now ignoring moc/pf buffs
            He lowered her position after the last Moc which was actually brutal for her. This one was pretty comfy for her
        It's based on usage rates sometimes sso lack of small mobs affected her latest standings
It's moc
    Ohh mb😭😭
Memory of chaos
Memory of Chaos.
Pryden's tier list
I presume this tier list is about moc
    So what's wrong with Himeko in MOC?
        not a lot of damage, talent is hard to trigger if there aren’t a lot of fodder and just being generally outclassed
This is for MoC, Himeko is really good in Pure Fiction
https://www.prydwen.gg/star-rail/tier-list
It's MoC stats not pure fiction tho C is kinda low but somewhat understandable
She is, but she really needs two Nihility teammates and her personal LC is a massive upgrade.

If you just started the most realistic team for you is probably Acheron/Pela/Gui/Sustain.
    Toss in Gallagher as the sustain, decent chance they have him and he’s her best 4 star.
        I tried E6 Gallagher/Silver Wolf/Sparkle/E2S1 Acheron and couldn't keep the team alive in the current MoC12. Which is an outlier, but I'm not so hot on Gallagher as solo sustain.
            Oof. I heard it’s rough but doable with E2 Gallagher. I’d assume it would take a *lot* of investment though.

Natasha and Lynx aren’t going to heal that much better than Gallagher and he’s at least got a debuff.

Plus in all fairness, Floor 12 is probably out of touch for a newbie unless they cheese it super hard or get mad lucky with relics.
                I'm not sure. I haven't busted out the calculator on this or anything, but since Gallagher's healing is directly tied to a debuff, enemies with very high speed will shed the mark and then he can't heal the team anymore outside of his skill. The MoC 12 boss on the second half has 160 speed, so keeping the mark up is hard (That's the example I'm going with, but any enemy with high speed or debuff cleanse like Cocolia is going to really hurt Gallagher's healing vs Natasha or Lynx)
If you mean Acheron, yes, she's a very good as a damage dealer with high aoe and single target burst damage from her ultimate that ignores weakness types.
    Oh cool, I lucked out then!
Keqing got her revival with aggravate though. Yanqing revival in 3.0 inc?
    my goats from both games
>Bailu takes the banner of being the worst 5 star and continues Qiqi's legacy

I disagree with that, cleanse is ridiculously overrated. Bailu has one of the best healing output, easily being able to sustain by only using her ult while Lynx with the same gear struggles. Bailu can even outheal most DoTs. So the only fight Bailu is bad in, are those with strong CC. But her healing output, damage reduction and revive still give her a niche. 

Compare that to Yanqing. He needs specific teammates to avoid getting hit. He gets 60% crit chance on ult, but it has an extremely high cost. So either you build him with 40% crit and don't deal damage outside of the ult turn, or you waste your ult buff. His kit just has fundamental problems that is not really fixable. And even when you jump through all those hoops, at best you end up with a single target Jingliu. Unlike Bailu, he just lacks a niche.
Nah cleanse is overrated unless it's team wide 5 stacks of wind shear or you need someone's ult immediately imo 

I see people dying with healer only teams all the time, but I have never struggled to survive with Bailu. That and people treat her revive as an emergency button instead of a resource, if I have one teammate low and I still have my revive then I'm not wasting SP or a burst healing them lol
Its MoC not PF.
    in any tier list. i just like running her even though i know she isn't the best unit.
        Well she is one of the best characters in PF. She just doesn’t have the raw damage for MoC so people rate her low there. She isn’t underrated its just MoC isn’t good for her kit.
            True. i just run her regardless as someone who won't bench her.
Because this is tierlist for MOC?
my art jumpscare !?!
    It is beautiful

Thank you for this gift
Hmm, I think he really meant that 🤨
You can edit your comment, you know?
also fucking*
be a hindrance to our team
tragically overperform
Yanqing before 2.1: "TASUKETE, GEPAAARD"
    Yanqing after 2.2: "I'm now a gambling man!"
    lol ye and gepard hates bronya
Having been stuck with him since like 1.2 as my only ice DPS (I finally pulled Jingliu yesterday, so bye bye fuckquing) that's blatantly false and anyone who actually played him would confirm it.

He requires shielders only against enemies that spam AOE or DoT. For anything else you can deal with the loss in DPS. I 30* and 36* multiple MoCs thanks to him. He does his thing, and it's absolutely not on DH or Arlan level of power.

I've made 3* clears on MoC 11 and 4* clears on MoC 12 with him: and since this result varies dramatically with the level of investment of one's account, let's say that that's on par with my limited 5* DPSs, my Clara and my Qingque.
    Translation: "I had bad luck and got objectively the worst 5\* character in the game and now want to retcon their power level while people are high off a mediocre combo between them and Aventurine so I'll embellish the truth about how effective they work when they do take damage and act like 99% of the enemies in this game in MoC 11/12 don't have AoE".   

If your limited 5\*'s and Clara don't outperform your Yanqing it's not because Yanqing is good it's because you have zero investment into your other 5\*'s or don't know how to play them.
        That shows that you don't know the character.

Yanquing issue is not in power, but flexibility. He's not a character that can force content and has a very narrow niche, but in that niche he performs fine.

The point was always "he is not Arlan level". If I can chose between him and Clara in an encounter, I'd run Clara any day, but sometimes he was the best choice.

Putting this aside for a moment: him being so narrow and with little to offer besides the element and the multipliers really made him get old faster than any other character. I haven't been using him in the last two MoC because my account has enough alternatives and his niche is less existent than before.
            Issue is his niche can’t take advantage of av advancers and needs sp+ supports w out aventurine
Happy cake day
No, Arlan is bad. He can be built usable, but he's bad.
    Full disclaimer, I haven't built Arlan, but at least from what I've seen he has notable strengths that he can play to; his main issue has always been the difficulty of actually keeping him alive at low HP to take advantage of his Talent, which Aventurine solves. Not consuming SP means he can comfortably use Skill twice with -1 SPD Bronya, the Talent's DMG boost is sizable, and he has a great multiplier on his Ultimate, especially with E6. I'm not expecting him to be limited character level, but I'd be surprised if he stays D tier.
    I literally never touched him cuz it'd be a waste of resources when I have, literally two of the best dps characters in the game
        There is a point in the game where, from that perspective, every resource you use is a waste because you already have enough. And that's not so far from where you are.
            I didn't think like that, thanks!
                Yeah at some point you'll pull just to get a different feel of the team, maybe I feel like using DoT, maybe FuA, maybe good old monoquantum QQ, maybe I feel lazy and just brute force with JL.

This eventually leads to trying out weaker 4* with busted supports lol
                    Ah, sweet!
            That's quitter talk, every resource is valuable to increase by crit dmg by another 5%
    If he wasn't Lightning and saved on SP they'd be almost no scenarios where he could fit in as a niche. Sure, maybe we'll get MoC or PF where HP drain is good so if you don't have Blade or Jingliu (and Sam guessing from the lightcone in the shop) he could be used but...
        >If he wasn't Lightning and saved on SP

They give you Serval for free, that can keep a very high DPS on a skill-basic-basic rotation... I don't think there is any reason to build Arlan if not because you like him.
            The saving SP and Self Damage could come up depending on MoC or challenges but yeah 99% of them time just go Serval
Agreed. I got aventurine today and with the survivability I got from him, I was able to clear first half of MoC 12 with Arlan in 4 cycles.
Survivability isn't even his major issue, it's simply that he doesn't do enough damage even without his downside.
Survivabilty is one thing but damge is bigger of an issue
Yeah until 2.2 gave every elite a ton of AOE which is when he really fell off. Like the moment 2.2 launched he suddenly just felt unplayable compared to to just a day before because of the new enemies
    Did you mean 1.2? 2.2 isn't even out yet lol
        yeah 1.2. they added all the AOE shit then which DUMPSTERED him
As a character that was supposed to be an SP battery she's just not that at all. A normal support with high speed and spamming basic attacks generates close to the same amount, while doing a lot more.
Yanqings main Flaw was that he required a shielder to function, which only two before Aventurine existed and one was unviable 

Now the Aventruine is here Yanqing can now much more easily go off with a constant shielder that also oh so happened to get more shields if a FUA is done, which while not consistent Yanqing does have
They were always basically a general tierlist anyway since their tierlist rankings are skewed by their own bias that goes contrary to their own data.
    Agreed. You just need to read the review sections and you can see the bias pretty clear.
        I've been reading a lot of comments about prydwens own bias in these lists, but are there any examples of those?
            The evidence is that they rated *<X, my fav character>* as not a S+ unit.
            Jing Yuan was one of the more extreme examples. There were multiple MOCs where his best teams, based on the clear time averages that Prywden posts in its own site, was at least part of the Top 3 DPS in clear times (even before Sparkle came out), and yet he was rated worse than other DPS for some reason.

edit: I am aware that rankings are not based on a specific MOC cycle. I am talking about average performance, not a specific cycle with buffs.
                You’re literally replying to a thread that says Prydwen doesn’t base their tier list on individual MOCs.
                    Yes, but would not general performance over multiple MOC cycles be indicative of power level of a unit? Average performance indicates a trend. JY was never that low power level wise as the data across time suggested, which was my point.
                afaik the tier lists are rated for e0 with f2p cones, is the MOC data also with e0/f2p cones?

edit: 

looks like the avg cycles only considers e0 characters yeah. at that point idk, I'd be interested in hearing the justification. they should do a better job at explaining the ratings if they have a tier list lol

how was jy rated? characters within a tier are alphabatized it seems
                    [deleted]
                        why do you assume acheron is rated with her sig in mind?
                            If you look at Acheron's character page, you can view the LC assumptions they have on their damage calculations, where, Acheron is assumed to use an S5 version of a gacha LC (good night LC), or her signature LC. She is the only character with damage calcs in the Prywden website using gacha LCs that are not from the welfare Herta store/MOC shop.

I do acknowledge that this does not necessarily confirm that Prywden used the same LC assumptions for ranking purposes, but it at least shows that they are willing to make "special conditions" for certain characters that they don't do for others to hype them up. I actually personally have Acheron at E0 S1 and I know she's one of the few characters that fundamentally change without her signature.

Again, no hate on Prywden -- I would still say that they have useful guides, but just be careful in taking their rankings at face value. Take of that as you will.
            QQ is the biggest example of this, she have nothing to do in the same tier than the like of Seele/JY/Ratio. 

Should be A tier maximum.
            QQ in S tier is the most obvious example
I’m guessing his follow up has smth to do with that
    His follow up only hits the same target so it’s still bad
        You can still get more than 9 points
        Hitting the same target still counts
            If you NA on a character turn and someone else follows up (Kafka, Topass, etc.) what's the interaction like? Do both get the point? Only the person hitting?
                It only counts for the one who's hitting the dice
                The follow-up counts for the character who does it. So Kafka/Topaz would get an additional roll there
freeze hard counters him since it prevents the betting phase from activating
Have you seen Misha's ultimate with ruan mei on a single enemy?
    Everyday I’m sad I don’t have Misha. I want the funny freeze shenanigans too!
        Misha is (in my opinion) underated. His mechanics are fun to play and he has rng AoE and the less enemies there are, the more powerful his ultimate becomoes.
            I feel like there are lots of 4*s like this. Xueyi has RNG with her followup, but if all three hits hit the same target (i.e. there is only one target) it's probably the most damage a 4-star can do currently. I forget if its a trace or eidolon but it can also have universal weakness depletion so if all three hits land the same target, it'll do a lot of weakness damage as well. 

Asta is the same way. Her fire break against a single target is pretty much unmatched, and Sampo too.
                4* are the queens and kings of "i could be SO good if i land my rng attack"
                    If yanqings followup is 100% chance instead too
                Everyone with this attack jumping abilities are so good
                Xueyi's E2, and the E1 adds 40% to each hit of her follow up.

So it's 130%x3 that heals 5%, reduces anyone's toughness, and gets buffed by Xueyi's "1:1 Break to DMG%" up to 240%.
                That would be true if QQ didn’t exist, haha… the queen of the highest ceilings and lowest floors
                    Very rng dependent tho.
                        Just be lucky (Reset the fight until it happens)
                    If her FUA triggered on every attack she would be S+ tier.
            He is basically 4 star JY
        You could get him from the Vignette in a Cup event if you haven't yet. If you still didn't pick him then who'd you get from it?
            Xueyi
                Still a great choice! She works great in Pure Fiction with anyone who can provide the stacks.
        Misha is so fun for remembrance runs in SU
Is she that good at breaking? I have her, I might as well as build her, since she is so good in HI3
    She does some of the highest toughness damage in the game and also doesn't consume SP on her skill if she attacks a weakness broken target making her a really weirdly unique but effective breaker DPS. But be warned that it's only single target and ofc only against physical weak breakbars, so this makes her a lot more niche in practice.
        Good point. Still, for physical weak bosses, with Gallapher and Ruan Mei, I bet she will shine. Also kind of funny if I use Bronya with her for free skills 2x/turn.
            Wouldn't Luka be better to use instead of Bronya? One of them with BE build while other one have standard build.
        Would you go break effect on her or do you mean just in general using her to break enemy weaknesses? Because her E4 looks nice for a BE build, but then I realize Luka exists. He is also single target with high toughness damage, but he can also detonate the bleed dot. So I'm always a bit lost on what Sushang's niche is suppose to be.
            Her shtick is action advance, large self speed buff and the ability to build crit/BE hybrid, mostly. Generally these two fulfill a similar role but for different teams, with Luka being geared more towards dot teams and Su preferring hypercarry/crit comps so it's mostly down to gameplay preferences or what characters you have or want to build
I've made a promise to build her in the event that I fail to pull yeehaw man whenever he comes out.
Sushang's kit in general is often very good for MoC/PF. In this turbulence for example, she can help stack. 

Similarly March has been swimming in season advantages for a while now. All her return fire counts towards the 6 stack. Her quick energy regen = lots of ults = stack shatter. She even contributes a bit on the follow up stacking in PF with the bird cage thing albeit her throughput isn't that great.
Current Dan Heng life experience isn't much but by chronological age he's by far the oldest crew member, he just gets lopped in with the amnesiac young adult gang (March, TB, why are y'all amnesiacs? Acheron foreshadowing?!)
    the teen team
Dan Heng is older than himeko tho, by a lot.
Dan Heng, not even Dan Feng, is centuries old. Dude is even more ancient than Welt.
bro?? Isn't dan heng like 70+ in Vidyadhara years??
Already E1. From Limited and Standard.. but hey i still have my 300 picker

                    That's a really good one!
Extremely complicated character Himeko: uses skill every turn, ult when it's up, no specific teambuilding restrictions?
    having to break effectively(aka don't break both elites at once) to make sure that you get her follow ups as much as possible is the thing you have to worry about, which despite not being that much extra to worry about it makes the feelscrafters piss themselves, similarly to having to actually worry about skill order when using jing yuan  
"you have to mildly think when using this character in a strategy game therefore bad" is the motto of prydwen, they're untrustworthy to give accurate assessments, you can tell because they have a tier list to begin with, tiering characters when things are as situational as playing star rail's endgame is going to misinform players who don't know any better (such as a good chunk of this subreddit)
        Looks like you missed literally every single note on the tierlist stating how many factors play into it. (and also that 36* are possible regardless of tiers if you invested enough)

But even as someone who really likes FUA teams, Himeko is really bad in and non-AOE setting without Fire weaknesses. Replacing her with any actual blast or single-target character in MOC is usually going to be significantly better for your general damage. 

And no, Jing Yuan wasn’t considered "mid“ because he was more complicated to use, but because of the sheer amount of investment he needs to work decently, and how easily a single CC can completely fuck up your cycle, moreso than pretty much any other character with backloaded damage.
        JY is in S for both lists though??
        Jing Yuan is in S for both lists
the refrain of the low-tier is always "they're incredible if you play them right," where "inrcredible" means "almost as strong as a high-tier" and "play them right" means "satisfy a bunch of extra and situational requirements that better characters don't have to worry about"
    The standard five stars all have some jank that makes them more difficult to play or less efficient than the limiteds, that's why they're permanent and not limited to begin with, that doesn't mean that they're necessarily bad though, and speaking of tiers in a game as complex with it's team building as star rail is disingenuous and hurts anyone learning the game at large as it will end up making people not build good characters because dickwipes are telling them that they're bad.  
Himeko's skill has roughly 72% of the MV of jingliu's enhanced skill but jingliu can only spend 60% of her turns doing that damage, and then has the follow up attack which is very easily spammable (in the situation of facing fire weak elites), plus grand duke and the 15% crit rate is really nice, not exactly comparable to the hp drain attack buff or the 50% CR from being in the buffed state and himeko gets a lot more out of facing fire weak opponents than jingliu gets out of ice weak, but facing weaknesses is the intention considering how your damage is just cut by 20% at least if you're not, and that's the only thing himeko has to worry about compared to "high-tiers", unless if you include the arduous task of breaking the two elites individually, unfortunately that's something this shit site considers as being a massive detriment and is complete bullshit.
Come on man I like Himeko but in moc she does not remotely compare to the destruction carries and Acheron. You want a lot of breaks and you want them often so she's one of the best for pure fiction but moc, not so much. I already prefer Topaz against a fire weak side and once Firefly comes out it's completely over.
    fantastic idea, topaz and hime together, maybe with a ruan mei, or an asta if you made a bad decision like I did.  
all I'm saying is that my mediocre built himeko getting 50k per skill (in blast) with the only buff coming from asta, versus a similarly mediocre IL only getting 120k on a fulgurant leap with tingyun + hanya.  
can't compare my jingliu in good faith with her being e1 and with her sig so automatically getting a massive damage boost in single target and my blade is terrible so also not fair   
can't be assed to really do damage per round/rotation calculations for a full numbers comparison but if in my own experience she's able to compete with a similarly mid built IL then that's enough to tell me that she works perfectly fine.
Himeko is objectively not good in MoC. The good MoC DPS units have damage multipliers that blow hers out of the water for 1-2 targets and they have massive self buffs she doesn't have to boot.                     

She's really good in PF though, so even if you're simped out I still dunno why you're upset people correctly say she isn't good in MoC. There are two end game modes and she's one of the best DPS for one of them, why's that not enough?
    She's got a blast attack, all the five star eruditions are essentially blast units(her skill which is only 80% of jingliu's single target attack and 66% of the damage to units on the sides, which is compensated by the ultimate and follow up attack's hits as well, (just to add on lightning lord is a blast attack and argenti's full ult is technically aoe into bounce but that usually ends up with the bounce hitting the big targets, therefore blast)

I'm upset because it's simple misinformation, slandering one of the standard characters for no good reason, opportunity cost isn't as big a factor in a game where you may not have all of the characters and she's great for fire weak opponents in moc. 

Not going to take anything about facing non fire weak enemies because the intention is for you to use characters against opponents weak to their elements, not something that should dictate the place on a tier list (tier lists are bad regardless), yes she's one of the best in PF, but she's also fantastic in MOC, anyone saying otherwise either didn't bother, didn't have a built enough himeko or are bad at the game.

the pricks at prydwen are a case of people bad at the game, evidenced by how they bumped up jing yuan after sparkle's release when he works perfectly with tingyun and asta, replacing asta with sparkle is a big buff but becuase asta needs you to consider when you use her skill, or god forsake how lightning lord dare not have a bronya buff, is asinine.
        JY definitely doesn't work perfectly with TY and Asta though. JY is extremely SP negative, Asta is extremely SP negative, Tingyun isn't even SP positive with JY because she has to use her skill more often than once per 3 turns due to JY's buff often needing a refresh while he's on one turn remaining to make sure the buff is still active when LL goes. Even running a fully SP positive sustain like Luocha doesn't make that team not run out of SP if the trio are all trying to play to their max potential. Yes you can just not Asta skill sometimes and let her buffs drop some in value and get less ults, and the team will do fine. But that's not the team working perfectly is it? You're literally making Asta perform worse than she can to make the team work at all, there's no world I'd call that perfect. Meanwhile Sparkle buffs more than Asta, has less buff overlap with TY, and is SP positive, and gives more effective speed stat to JY, so the team's issues all vanish while the strong points get stronger. Sparkle is a perfect solution to JY's problems and I think it's completely fair to say he's one of the units who benefited most from her addition.                   

Also, it's literally not misinformation. Himeko's multipliers are significantly lower than other DPS units in context of a mode where a team only has up to 5 cycles to clear a side assuming the other side's team is same strength, and she doesn't give herself any big buffs the way better MoC DPS units do. Idk, there's no way around that in spite of you acting like it's not significant, but it really is. Yes, if you invest in her to the max she can clear fire weak MoC comfortably, that doesn't make her "incredible" in any sense of the word, every single DPS in the game can be heavily invested in and clear MoC. Better DPS do not need to be well invested into to clear comfortably. You say there's no opportunity cost but there absolutely is, the opportunity cost is that it takes a long time to build units in this game and getting Himeko a great build aka having good gear is an RNG time sink that could take months. Every single DPS on the S or S+ tier of that tier list you hate give themselves some form of massive damage up/crit up/atk up/etc., be it through skills or ults or major traces, and it significantly decreases their reliance on being well built to perform.                   

Idk, seems like you just hate Prydwen and have a chip on your shoulder in general about people not wanting to hyper invest into units you like that aren't good in MoC. But tbh, no one cares that lower tier units can do well if invested in, and it only makes yourself unhappier to get so upset over it you're starting arguments with strangers online. Good luck with that in the future, hope my comment is useful in any way at all, I'm not gonna reply any more lol.
Don't know about OP but I use 2pc/2pc atk% sets. The problem i see alot of people have for yanqing is that they don't build crit rate on him. He still wants like 40% so he's at 60% on while his talent is active and at 100% for his ultimate. I have 46/184 with him and its been pretty nice.

I personally never have issues with him  but i guess it depends on the gameplay preference of each player
anytime I bring up how hsr players have a very high chance of being on a registry I get banned from the sub for a couple days
it's unclear
What do you mean?
    I think he's talking about your username
        We don't have his official age. And which kid works at a hotel?
            he literally talks about how he will grow up one day, and is referred to as a child multiple times
                So I was right about him being a kid 😭
            Is a serious question? Kids in hotel where pretty common. That is what misha is, a lobby boy

                    ?? Are you scared of kids in a hotel lmao
                    Warning of what? History?
                    Warning of what????
                But not nowadays, right? Or this still a thing?
                    Today not in developed countries. In some poor countries children with jobs are still a thing.
Also this is way more recent than you think my dad is 62 and he started working at an 5 star hotel at age 15 as a waiter.
                        Damn. Sounds hard
                            That’s it? We established he absolutely is a child and is referred to as one multiple and you’re essentially like “dam… well anyways”.
                    Yeah but Penacony is very much modelled after the time period where they were common
                        Indeed penacony has strong 20s or 30s vives. Robin mic is also the very old style use in that time frame.

                            The other is a real picture. But this was common until the 1950s. I shared this picture because this movie os very well know and the best movie depiction of a lobby boy.
                Exactly what I was waiting for following this trend lmao
            Acts like a kid, talks a kid, looks like a kid, why even take a chance dude? This isn’t even talking about him literally talking about doing stuff *when he grows up* and he’s referred to as a child multiple times.

Ohhhh my bad😭😭
I still think C is too low for her. She is at the very least B tier and still able to clear MoC 12 if she is against fire weak enemies
    [removed]
        Well that is why she is pretty good with Topaz. A Topaz, Himeko, Asta team is really solid. Topaz and Asta just delete toughness bars against single targets. Asta also buffs fire damage dps characters and when combined with Planetary Rendezvous + Penacony relic + Fire buff trace her buffing power is quite substantial. The only issue is that Ruan Mei is better than her. Even in the most perfect ideal scenario for Asta. Ruan Mei is just too absurd.
            > Well that is why she is pretty good with Topaz.

So if she needs Topaz to be good, then it's not Himeko that is solid, but Topaz instead
                but prydew doesn't care about this, look a kafka jumped to S+ with black swan, look a dhil  jumped to S+ with sparkle, look at yanqing jumped to C with aventurine...
                Well I do not think Topaz is that amazing though. Some characters just synergize well with each other. They cover each other's weaknesses and work off each other abilities.
                    > Well I do not think Topaz is that amazing though. Some characters just synergize well with each other. They cover each other's weaknesses and work off each other abilities.

Except this entire thread is about a tier list that rates characters based mostly on their individual kits

And you are downplaying Topaz SO bad especially when she opens up multiple team compositions involving followup characters. If you think mono Fire or enabling Himeko is the only thing she can do, think again.
                        Never said she is only good for enabling Himeko. Also this is a team game. You can not just consider individual kits but their relationship with others as well as the content. Topaz is great in MoC but pales in comparison to Himeko in Pure Fiction.

For example [Himeko + Topaz](https://youtu.be/WPnx_7WM9Ag?t=62) is amazing against the Ebon Deer.

    Prydwen updates their tier list to current content. Current MOC has low fire weakness, ergo Himeko is ranked lower.
        Not since 1.6, its a generalist tier list now ignoring moc/pf buffs
        He lowered her position after the last Moc which was actually brutal for her. This one was pretty comfy for her
    It's based on usage rates sometimes sso lack of small mobs affected her latest standings
Ohh mb😭😭
So what's wrong with Himeko in MOC?
    not a lot of damage, talent is hard to trigger if there aren’t a lot of fodder and just being generally outclassed
Toss in Gallagher as the sustain, decent chance they have him and he’s her best 4 star.
    I tried E6 Gallagher/Silver Wolf/Sparkle/E2S1 Acheron and couldn't keep the team alive in the current MoC12. Which is an outlier, but I'm not so hot on Gallagher as solo sustain.
        Oof. I heard it’s rough but doable with E2 Gallagher. I’d assume it would take a *lot* of investment though.

Natasha and Lynx aren’t going to heal that much better than Gallagher and he’s at least got a debuff.

Plus in all fairness, Floor 12 is probably out of touch for a newbie unless they cheese it super hard or get mad lucky with relics.
            I'm not sure. I haven't busted out the calculator on this or anything, but since Gallagher's healing is directly tied to a debuff, enemies with very high speed will shed the mark and then he can't heal the team anymore outside of his skill. The MoC 12 boss on the second half has 160 speed, so keeping the mark up is hard (That's the example I'm going with, but any enemy with high speed or debuff cleanse like Cocolia is going to really hurt Gallagher's healing vs Natasha or Lynx)
Oh cool, I lucked out then!
my goats from both games
in any tier list. i just like running her even though i know she isn't the best unit.
    Well she is one of the best characters in PF. She just doesn’t have the raw damage for MoC so people rate her low there. She isn’t underrated its just MoC isn’t good for her kit.
        True. i just run her regardless as someone who won't bench her.
It is beautiful

Thank you for this gift
Yanqing after 2.2: "I'm now a gambling man!"
lol ye and gepard hates bronya
Translation: "I had bad luck and got objectively the worst 5\* character in the game and now want to retcon their power level while people are high off a mediocre combo between them and Aventurine so I'll embellish the truth about how effective they work when they do take damage and act like 99% of the enemies in this game in MoC 11/12 don't have AoE".   

If your limited 5\*'s and Clara don't outperform your Yanqing it's not because Yanqing is good it's because you have zero investment into your other 5\*'s or don't know how to play them.
    That shows that you don't know the character.

Yanquing issue is not in power, but flexibility. He's not a character that can force content and has a very narrow niche, but in that niche he performs fine.

The point was always "he is not Arlan level". If I can chose between him and Clara in an encounter, I'd run Clara any day, but sometimes he was the best choice.

Putting this aside for a moment: him being so narrow and with little to offer besides the element and the multipliers really made him get old faster than any other character. I haven't been using him in the last two MoC because my account has enough alternatives and his niche is less existent than before.
        Issue is his niche can’t take advantage of av advancers and needs sp+ supports w out aventurine
Full disclaimer, I haven't built Arlan, but at least from what I've seen he has notable strengths that he can play to; his main issue has always been the difficulty of actually keeping him alive at low HP to take advantage of his Talent, which Aventurine solves. Not consuming SP means he can comfortably use Skill twice with -1 SPD Bronya, the Talent's DMG boost is sizable, and he has a great multiplier on his Ultimate, especially with E6. I'm not expecting him to be limited character level, but I'd be surprised if he stays D tier.
I literally never touched him cuz it'd be a waste of resources when I have, literally two of the best dps characters in the game
    There is a point in the game where, from that perspective, every resource you use is a waste because you already have enough. And that's not so far from where you are.
        I didn't think like that, thanks!
            Yeah at some point you'll pull just to get a different feel of the team, maybe I feel like using DoT, maybe FuA, maybe good old monoquantum QQ, maybe I feel lazy and just brute force with JL.

This eventually leads to trying out weaker 4* with busted supports lol
                Ah, sweet!
        That's quitter talk, every resource is valuable to increase by crit dmg by another 5%
If he wasn't Lightning and saved on SP they'd be almost no scenarios where he could fit in as a niche. Sure, maybe we'll get MoC or PF where HP drain is good so if you don't have Blade or Jingliu (and Sam guessing from the lightcone in the shop) he could be used but...
    >If he wasn't Lightning and saved on SP

They give you Serval for free, that can keep a very high DPS on a skill-basic-basic rotation... I don't think there is any reason to build Arlan if not because you like him.
        The saving SP and Self Damage could come up depending on MoC or challenges but yeah 99% of them time just go Serval
Did you mean 1.2? 2.2 isn't even out yet lol
    yeah 1.2. they added all the AOE shit then which DUMPSTERED him
Agreed. You just need to read the review sections and you can see the bias pretty clear.
    I've been reading a lot of comments about prydwens own bias in these lists, but are there any examples of those?
        The evidence is that they rated *<X, my fav character>* as not a S+ unit.
        Jing Yuan was one of the more extreme examples. There were multiple MOCs where his best teams, based on the clear time averages that Prywden posts in its own site, was at least part of the Top 3 DPS in clear times (even before Sparkle came out), and yet he was rated worse than other DPS for some reason.

edit: I am aware that rankings are not based on a specific MOC cycle. I am talking about average performance, not a specific cycle with buffs.
            You’re literally replying to a thread that says Prydwen doesn’t base their tier list on individual MOCs.
                Yes, but would not general performance over multiple MOC cycles be indicative of power level of a unit? Average performance indicates a trend. JY was never that low power level wise as the data across time suggested, which was my point.
            afaik the tier lists are rated for e0 with f2p cones, is the MOC data also with e0/f2p cones?

edit: 

looks like the avg cycles only considers e0 characters yeah. at that point idk, I'd be interested in hearing the justification. they should do a better job at explaining the ratings if they have a tier list lol

how was jy rated? characters within a tier are alphabatized it seems
                [deleted]
                    why do you assume acheron is rated with her sig in mind?
                        If you look at Acheron's character page, you can view the LC assumptions they have on their damage calculations, where, Acheron is assumed to use an S5 version of a gacha LC (good night LC), or her signature LC. She is the only character with damage calcs in the Prywden website using gacha LCs that are not from the welfare Herta store/MOC shop.

I do acknowledge that this does not necessarily confirm that Prywden used the same LC assumptions for ranking purposes, but it at least shows that they are willing to make "special conditions" for certain characters that they don't do for others to hype them up. I actually personally have Acheron at E0 S1 and I know she's one of the few characters that fundamentally change without her signature.

Again, no hate on Prywden -- I would still say that they have useful guides, but just be careful in taking their rankings at face value. Take of that as you will.
        QQ is the biggest example of this, she have nothing to do in the same tier than the like of Seele/JY/Ratio. 

Should be A tier maximum.
        QQ in S tier is the most obvious example
His follow up only hits the same target so it’s still bad
    You can still get more than 9 points
    Hitting the same target still counts
        If you NA on a character turn and someone else follows up (Kafka, Topass, etc.) what's the interaction like? Do both get the point? Only the person hitting?
            It only counts for the one who's hitting the dice
            The follow-up counts for the character who does it. So Kafka/Topaz would get an additional roll there
Everyday I’m sad I don’t have Misha. I want the funny freeze shenanigans too!
    Misha is (in my opinion) underated. His mechanics are fun to play and he has rng AoE and the less enemies there are, the more powerful his ultimate becomoes.
        I feel like there are lots of 4*s like this. Xueyi has RNG with her followup, but if all three hits hit the same target (i.e. there is only one target) it's probably the most damage a 4-star can do currently. I forget if its a trace or eidolon but it can also have universal weakness depletion so if all three hits land the same target, it'll do a lot of weakness damage as well. 

Asta is the same way. Her fire break against a single target is pretty much unmatched, and Sampo too.
            4* are the queens and kings of "i could be SO good if i land my rng attack"
                If yanqings followup is 100% chance instead too
            Everyone with this attack jumping abilities are so good
            Xueyi's E2, and the E1 adds 40% to each hit of her follow up.

So it's 130%x3 that heals 5%, reduces anyone's toughness, and gets buffed by Xueyi's "1:1 Break to DMG%" up to 240%.
            That would be true if QQ didn’t exist, haha… the queen of the highest ceilings and lowest floors
                Very rng dependent tho.
                    Just be lucky (Reset the fight until it happens)
                If her FUA triggered on every attack she would be S+ tier.
        He is basically 4 star JY
    You could get him from the Vignette in a Cup event if you haven't yet. If you still didn't pick him then who'd you get from it?
        Xueyi
            Still a great choice! She works great in Pure Fiction with anyone who can provide the stacks.
    Misha is so fun for remembrance runs in SU
She does some of the highest toughness damage in the game and also doesn't consume SP on her skill if she attacks a weakness broken target making her a really weirdly unique but effective breaker DPS. But be warned that it's only single target and ofc only against physical weak breakbars, so this makes her a lot more niche in practice.
    Good point. Still, for physical weak bosses, with Gallapher and Ruan Mei, I bet she will shine. Also kind of funny if I use Bronya with her for free skills 2x/turn.
        Wouldn't Luka be better to use instead of Bronya? One of them with BE build while other one have standard build.
    Would you go break effect on her or do you mean just in general using her to break enemy weaknesses? Because her E4 looks nice for a BE build, but then I realize Luka exists. He is also single target with high toughness damage, but he can also detonate the bleed dot. So I'm always a bit lost on what Sushang's niche is suppose to be.
        Her shtick is action advance, large self speed buff and the ability to build crit/BE hybrid, mostly. Generally these two fulfill a similar role but for different teams, with Luka being geared more towards dot teams and Su preferring hypercarry/crit comps so it's mostly down to gameplay preferences or what characters you have or want to build

                That's a really good one!
having to break effectively(aka don't break both elites at once) to make sure that you get her follow ups as much as possible is the thing you have to worry about, which despite not being that much extra to worry about it makes the feelscrafters piss themselves, similarly to having to actually worry about skill order when using jing yuan  
"you have to mildly think when using this character in a strategy game therefore bad" is the motto of prydwen, they're untrustworthy to give accurate assessments, you can tell because they have a tier list to begin with, tiering characters when things are as situational as playing star rail's endgame is going to misinform players who don't know any better (such as a good chunk of this subreddit)
    Looks like you missed literally every single note on the tierlist stating how many factors play into it. (and also that 36* are possible regardless of tiers if you invested enough)

But even as someone who really likes FUA teams, Himeko is really bad in and non-AOE setting without Fire weaknesses. Replacing her with any actual blast or single-target character in MOC is usually going to be significantly better for your general damage. 

And no, Jing Yuan wasn’t considered "mid“ because he was more complicated to use, but because of the sheer amount of investment he needs to work decently, and how easily a single CC can completely fuck up your cycle, moreso than pretty much any other character with backloaded damage.
    JY is in S for both lists though??
    Jing Yuan is in S for both lists
The standard five stars all have some jank that makes them more difficult to play or less efficient than the limiteds, that's why they're permanent and not limited to begin with, that doesn't mean that they're necessarily bad though, and speaking of tiers in a game as complex with it's team building as star rail is disingenuous and hurts anyone learning the game at large as it will end up making people not build good characters because dickwipes are telling them that they're bad.  
Himeko's skill has roughly 72% of the MV of jingliu's enhanced skill but jingliu can only spend 60% of her turns doing that damage, and then has the follow up attack which is very easily spammable (in the situation of facing fire weak elites), plus grand duke and the 15% crit rate is really nice, not exactly comparable to the hp drain attack buff or the 50% CR from being in the buffed state and himeko gets a lot more out of facing fire weak opponents than jingliu gets out of ice weak, but facing weaknesses is the intention considering how your damage is just cut by 20% at least if you're not, and that's the only thing himeko has to worry about compared to "high-tiers", unless if you include the arduous task of breaking the two elites individually, unfortunately that's something this shit site considers as being a massive detriment and is complete bullshit.
fantastic idea, topaz and hime together, maybe with a ruan mei, or an asta if you made a bad decision like I did.  
all I'm saying is that my mediocre built himeko getting 50k per skill (in blast) with the only buff coming from asta, versus a similarly mediocre IL only getting 120k on a fulgurant leap with tingyun + hanya.  
can't compare my jingliu in good faith with her being e1 and with her sig so automatically getting a massive damage boost in single target and my blade is terrible so also not fair   
can't be assed to really do damage per round/rotation calculations for a full numbers comparison but if in my own experience she's able to compete with a similarly mid built IL then that's enough to tell me that she works perfectly fine.
She's got a blast attack, all the five star eruditions are essentially blast units(her skill which is only 80% of jingliu's single target attack and 66% of the damage to units on the sides, which is compensated by the ultimate and follow up attack's hits as well, (just to add on lightning lord is a blast attack and argenti's full ult is technically aoe into bounce but that usually ends up with the bounce hitting the big targets, therefore blast)

I'm upset because it's simple misinformation, slandering one of the standard characters for no good reason, opportunity cost isn't as big a factor in a game where you may not have all of the characters and she's great for fire weak opponents in moc. 

Not going to take anything about facing non fire weak enemies because the intention is for you to use characters against opponents weak to their elements, not something that should dictate the place on a tier list (tier lists are bad regardless), yes she's one of the best in PF, but she's also fantastic in MOC, anyone saying otherwise either didn't bother, didn't have a built enough himeko or are bad at the game.

the pricks at prydwen are a case of people bad at the game, evidenced by how they bumped up jing yuan after sparkle's release when he works perfectly with tingyun and asta, replacing asta with sparkle is a big buff but becuase asta needs you to consider when you use her skill, or god forsake how lightning lord dare not have a bronya buff, is asinine.
    JY definitely doesn't work perfectly with TY and Asta though. JY is extremely SP negative, Asta is extremely SP negative, Tingyun isn't even SP positive with JY because she has to use her skill more often than once per 3 turns due to JY's buff often needing a refresh while he's on one turn remaining to make sure the buff is still active when LL goes. Even running a fully SP positive sustain like Luocha doesn't make that team not run out of SP if the trio are all trying to play to their max potential. Yes you can just not Asta skill sometimes and let her buffs drop some in value and get less ults, and the team will do fine. But that's not the team working perfectly is it? You're literally making Asta perform worse than she can to make the team work at all, there's no world I'd call that perfect. Meanwhile Sparkle buffs more than Asta, has less buff overlap with TY, and is SP positive, and gives more effective speed stat to JY, so the team's issues all vanish while the strong points get stronger. Sparkle is a perfect solution to JY's problems and I think it's completely fair to say he's one of the units who benefited most from her addition.                   

Also, it's literally not misinformation. Himeko's multipliers are significantly lower than other DPS units in context of a mode where a team only has up to 5 cycles to clear a side assuming the other side's team is same strength, and she doesn't give herself any big buffs the way better MoC DPS units do. Idk, there's no way around that in spite of you acting like it's not significant, but it really is. Yes, if you invest in her to the max she can clear fire weak MoC comfortably, that doesn't make her "incredible" in any sense of the word, every single DPS in the game can be heavily invested in and clear MoC. Better DPS do not need to be well invested into to clear comfortably. You say there's no opportunity cost but there absolutely is, the opportunity cost is that it takes a long time to build units in this game and getting Himeko a great build aka having good gear is an RNG time sink that could take months. Every single DPS on the S or S+ tier of that tier list you hate give themselves some form of massive damage up/crit up/atk up/etc., be it through skills or ults or major traces, and it significantly decreases their reliance on being well built to perform.                   

Idk, seems like you just hate Prydwen and have a chip on your shoulder in general about people not wanting to hyper invest into units you like that aren't good in MoC. But tbh, no one cares that lower tier units can do well if invested in, and it only makes yourself unhappier to get so upset over it you're starting arguments with strangers online. Good luck with that in the future, hope my comment is useful in any way at all, I'm not gonna reply any more lol.

    Well that is why she is pretty good with Topaz. A Topaz, Himeko, Asta team is really solid. Topaz and Asta just delete toughness bars against single targets. Asta also buffs fire damage dps characters and when combined with Planetary Rendezvous + Penacony relic + Fire buff trace her buffing power is quite substantial. The only issue is that Ruan Mei is better than her. Even in the most perfect ideal scenario for Asta. Ruan Mei is just too absurd.
        > Well that is why she is pretty good with Topaz.

So if she needs Topaz to be good, then it's not Himeko that is solid, but Topaz instead
            but prydew doesn't care about this, look a kafka jumped to S+ with black swan, look a dhil  jumped to S+ with sparkle, look at yanqing jumped to C with aventurine...
            Well I do not think Topaz is that amazing though. Some characters just synergize well with each other. They cover each other's weaknesses and work off each other abilities.
                > Well I do not think Topaz is that amazing though. Some characters just synergize well with each other. They cover each other's weaknesses and work off each other abilities.

Except this entire thread is about a tier list that rates characters based mostly on their individual kits

And you are downplaying Topaz SO bad especially when she opens up multiple team compositions involving followup characters. If you think mono Fire or enabling Himeko is the only thing she can do, think again.
                    Never said she is only good for enabling Himeko. Also this is a team game. You can not just consider individual kits but their relationship with others as well as the content. Topaz is great in MoC but pales in comparison to Himeko in Pure Fiction.

For example [Himeko + Topaz](https://youtu.be/WPnx_7WM9Ag?t=62) is amazing against the Ebon Deer.

Prydwen updates their tier list to current content. Current MOC has low fire weakness, ergo Himeko is ranked lower.
    Not since 1.6, its a generalist tier list now ignoring moc/pf buffs
    He lowered her position after the last Moc which was actually brutal for her. This one was pretty comfy for her
It's based on usage rates sometimes sso lack of small mobs affected her latest standings
not a lot of damage, talent is hard to trigger if there aren’t a lot of fodder and just being generally outclassed
I tried E6 Gallagher/Silver Wolf/Sparkle/E2S1 Acheron and couldn't keep the team alive in the current MoC12. Which is an outlier, but I'm not so hot on Gallagher as solo sustain.
    Oof. I heard it’s rough but doable with E2 Gallagher. I’d assume it would take a *lot* of investment though.

Natasha and Lynx aren’t going to heal that much better than Gallagher and he’s at least got a debuff.

Plus in all fairness, Floor 12 is probably out of touch for a newbie unless they cheese it super hard or get mad lucky with relics.
        I'm not sure. I haven't busted out the calculator on this or anything, but since Gallagher's healing is directly tied to a debuff, enemies with very high speed will shed the mark and then he can't heal the team anymore outside of his skill. The MoC 12 boss on the second half has 160 speed, so keeping the mark up is hard (That's the example I'm going with, but any enemy with high speed or debuff cleanse like Cocolia is going to really hurt Gallagher's healing vs Natasha or Lynx)
Well she is one of the best characters in PF. She just doesn’t have the raw damage for MoC so people rate her low there. She isn’t underrated its just MoC isn’t good for her kit.
    True. i just run her regardless as someone who won't bench her.
That shows that you don't know the character.

Yanquing issue is not in power, but flexibility. He's not a character that can force content and has a very narrow niche, but in that niche he performs fine.

The point was always "he is not Arlan level". If I can chose between him and Clara in an encounter, I'd run Clara any day, but sometimes he was the best choice.

Putting this aside for a moment: him being so narrow and with little to offer besides the element and the multipliers really made him get old faster than any other character. I haven't been using him in the last two MoC because my account has enough alternatives and his niche is less existent than before.
    Issue is his niche can’t take advantage of av advancers and needs sp+ supports w out aventurine
There is a point in the game where, from that perspective, every resource you use is a waste because you already have enough. And that's not so far from where you are.
    I didn't think like that, thanks!
        Yeah at some point you'll pull just to get a different feel of the team, maybe I feel like using DoT, maybe FuA, maybe good old monoquantum QQ, maybe I feel lazy and just brute force with JL.

This eventually leads to trying out weaker 4* with busted supports lol
            Ah, sweet!
    That's quitter talk, every resource is valuable to increase by crit dmg by another 5%
>If he wasn't Lightning and saved on SP

They give you Serval for free, that can keep a very high DPS on a skill-basic-basic rotation... I don't think there is any reason to build Arlan if not because you like him.
    The saving SP and Self Damage could come up depending on MoC or challenges but yeah 99% of them time just go Serval
yeah 1.2. they added all the AOE shit then which DUMPSTERED him
I've been reading a lot of comments about prydwens own bias in these lists, but are there any examples of those?
    The evidence is that they rated *<X, my fav character>* as not a S+ unit.
    Jing Yuan was one of the more extreme examples. There were multiple MOCs where his best teams, based on the clear time averages that Prywden posts in its own site, was at least part of the Top 3 DPS in clear times (even before Sparkle came out), and yet he was rated worse than other DPS for some reason.

edit: I am aware that rankings are not based on a specific MOC cycle. I am talking about average performance, not a specific cycle with buffs.
        You’re literally replying to a thread that says Prydwen doesn’t base their tier list on individual MOCs.
            Yes, but would not general performance over multiple MOC cycles be indicative of power level of a unit? Average performance indicates a trend. JY was never that low power level wise as the data across time suggested, which was my point.
        afaik the tier lists are rated for e0 with f2p cones, is the MOC data also with e0/f2p cones?

edit: 

looks like the avg cycles only considers e0 characters yeah. at that point idk, I'd be interested in hearing the justification. they should do a better job at explaining the ratings if they have a tier list lol

how was jy rated? characters within a tier are alphabatized it seems
            [deleted]
                why do you assume acheron is rated with her sig in mind?
                    If you look at Acheron's character page, you can view the LC assumptions they have on their damage calculations, where, Acheron is assumed to use an S5 version of a gacha LC (good night LC), or her signature LC. She is the only character with damage calcs in the Prywden website using gacha LCs that are not from the welfare Herta store/MOC shop.

I do acknowledge that this does not necessarily confirm that Prywden used the same LC assumptions for ranking purposes, but it at least shows that they are willing to make "special conditions" for certain characters that they don't do for others to hype them up. I actually personally have Acheron at E0 S1 and I know she's one of the few characters that fundamentally change without her signature.

Again, no hate on Prywden -- I would still say that they have useful guides, but just be careful in taking their rankings at face value. Take of that as you will.
    QQ is the biggest example of this, she have nothing to do in the same tier than the like of Seele/JY/Ratio. 

Should be A tier maximum.
    QQ in S tier is the most obvious example
You can still get more than 9 points
Hitting the same target still counts
    If you NA on a character turn and someone else follows up (Kafka, Topass, etc.) what's the interaction like? Do both get the point? Only the person hitting?
        It only counts for the one who's hitting the dice
        The follow-up counts for the character who does it. So Kafka/Topaz would get an additional roll there
Misha is (in my opinion) underated. His mechanics are fun to play and he has rng AoE and the less enemies there are, the more powerful his ultimate becomoes.
    I feel like there are lots of 4*s like this. Xueyi has RNG with her followup, but if all three hits hit the same target (i.e. there is only one target) it's probably the most damage a 4-star can do currently. I forget if its a trace or eidolon but it can also have universal weakness depletion so if all three hits land the same target, it'll do a lot of weakness damage as well. 

Asta is the same way. Her fire break against a single target is pretty much unmatched, and Sampo too.
        4* are the queens and kings of "i could be SO good if i land my rng attack"
            If yanqings followup is 100% chance instead too
        Everyone with this attack jumping abilities are so good
        Xueyi's E2, and the E1 adds 40% to each hit of her follow up.

So it's 130%x3 that heals 5%, reduces anyone's toughness, and gets buffed by Xueyi's "1:1 Break to DMG%" up to 240%.
        That would be true if QQ didn’t exist, haha… the queen of the highest ceilings and lowest floors
            Very rng dependent tho.
                Just be lucky (Reset the fight until it happens)
            If her FUA triggered on every attack she would be S+ tier.
    He is basically 4 star JY
You could get him from the Vignette in a Cup event if you haven't yet. If you still didn't pick him then who'd you get from it?
    Xueyi
        Still a great choice! She works great in Pure Fiction with anyone who can provide the stacks.
Misha is so fun for remembrance runs in SU
Good point. Still, for physical weak bosses, with Gallapher and Ruan Mei, I bet she will shine. Also kind of funny if I use Bronya with her for free skills 2x/turn.
    Wouldn't Luka be better to use instead of Bronya? One of them with BE build while other one have standard build.
Would you go break effect on her or do you mean just in general using her to break enemy weaknesses? Because her E4 looks nice for a BE build, but then I realize Luka exists. He is also single target with high toughness damage, but he can also detonate the bleed dot. So I'm always a bit lost on what Sushang's niche is suppose to be.
    Her shtick is action advance, large self speed buff and the ability to build crit/BE hybrid, mostly. Generally these two fulfill a similar role but for different teams, with Luka being geared more towards dot teams and Su preferring hypercarry/crit comps so it's mostly down to gameplay preferences or what characters you have or want to build

            That's a really good one!
Looks like you missed literally every single note on the tierlist stating how many factors play into it. (and also that 36* are possible regardless of tiers if you invested enough)

But even as someone who really likes FUA teams, Himeko is really bad in and non-AOE setting without Fire weaknesses. Replacing her with any actual blast or single-target character in MOC is usually going to be significantly better for your general damage. 

And no, Jing Yuan wasn’t considered "mid“ because he was more complicated to use, but because of the sheer amount of investment he needs to work decently, and how easily a single CC can completely fuck up your cycle, moreso than pretty much any other character with backloaded damage.
JY is in S for both lists though??
Jing Yuan is in S for both lists
JY definitely doesn't work perfectly with TY and Asta though. JY is extremely SP negative, Asta is extremely SP negative, Tingyun isn't even SP positive with JY because she has to use her skill more often than once per 3 turns due to JY's buff often needing a refresh while he's on one turn remaining to make sure the buff is still active when LL goes.

                Be sorry for being horny for a minor on main
                    Bro, it's a character. A Character. It doesn't matter if he's hurt, manipulated, killed or whatever, he is a bunch of lines animated with voicelines. Seriously what is wrong with u ppl
                Nah, fuck pedophiles :)
                    Bro, are u seriously equating literal children for a fictional character? Uuuh no thanks...
Don't worry, Caterina will be playable some day
    I Will destroy that Hagussy when shes out.I really want to see more fanarts of her.
Now it got attention
Well that is why she is pretty good with Topaz. A Topaz, Himeko, Asta team is really solid. Topaz and Asta just delete toughness bars against single targets. Asta also buffs fire damage dps characters and when combined with Planetary Rendezvous + Penacony relic + Fire buff trace her buffing power is quite substantial. The only issue is that Ruan Mei is better than her. Even in the most perfect ideal scenario for Asta. Ruan Mei is just too absurd.
    > Well that is why she is pretty good with Topaz.

So if she needs Topaz to be good, then it's not Himeko that is solid, but Topaz instead
        but prydew doesn't care about this, look a kafka jumped to S+ with black swan, look a dhil  jumped to S+ with sparkle, look at yanqing jumped to C with aventurine...
        Well I do not think Topaz is that amazing though. Some characters just synergize well with each other. They cover each other's weaknesses and work off each other abilities.
            > Well I do not think Topaz is that amazing though. Some characters just synergize well with each other. They cover each other's weaknesses and work off each other abilities.

Except this entire thread is about a tier list that rates characters based mostly on their individual kits

And you are downplaying Topaz SO bad especially when she opens up multiple team compositions involving followup characters. If you think mono Fire or enabling Himeko is the only thing she can do, think again.
                Never said she is only good for enabling Himeko. Also this is a team game. You can not just consider individual kits but their relationship with others as well as the content. Topaz is great in MoC but pales in comparison to Himeko in Pure Fiction.

For example [Himeko + Topaz](https://youtu.be/WPnx_7WM9Ag?t=62) is amazing against the Ebon Deer.

Not since 1.6, its a generalist tier list now ignoring moc/pf buffs
He lowered her position after the last Moc which was actually brutal for her. This one was pretty comfy for her
Oof. I heard it’s rough but doable with E2 Gallagher. I’d assume it would take a *lot* of investment though.

Natasha and Lynx aren’t going to heal that much better than Gallagher and he’s at least got a debuff.

Plus in all fairness, Floor 12 is probably out of touch for a newbie unless they cheese it super hard or get mad lucky with relics.
    I'm not sure. I haven't busted out the calculator on this or anything, but since Gallagher's healing is directly tied to a debuff, enemies with very high speed will shed the mark and then he can't heal the team anymore outside of his skill. The MoC 12 boss on the second half has 160 speed, so keeping the mark up is hard (That's the example I'm going with, but any enemy with high speed or debuff cleanse like Cocolia is going to really hurt Gallagher's healing vs Natasha or Lynx)
True. i just run her regardless as someone who won't bench her.
Issue is his niche can’t take advantage of av advancers and needs sp+ supports w out aventurine
I didn't think like that, thanks!
    Yeah at some point you'll pull just to get a different feel of the team, maybe I feel like using DoT, maybe FuA, maybe good old monoquantum QQ, maybe I feel lazy and just brute force with JL.

This eventually leads to trying out weaker 4* with busted supports lol
        Ah, sweet!
That's quitter talk, every resource is valuable to increase by crit dmg by another 5%
The saving SP and Self Damage could come up depending on MoC or challenges but yeah 99% of them time just go Serval
The evidence is that they rated *<X, my fav character>* as not a S+ unit.
Jing Yuan was one of the more extreme examples. There were multiple MOCs where his best teams, based on the clear time averages that Prywden posts in its own site, was at least part of the Top 3 DPS in clear times (even before Sparkle came out), and yet he was rated worse than other DPS for some reason.

edit: I am aware that rankings are not based on a specific MOC cycle. I am talking about average performance, not a specific cycle with buffs.
    You’re literally replying to a thread that says Prydwen doesn’t base their tier list on individual MOCs.
        Yes, but would not general performance over multiple MOC cycles be indicative of power level of a unit? Average performance indicates a trend. JY was never that low power level wise as the data across time suggested, which was my point.
    afaik the tier lists are rated for e0 with f2p cones, is the MOC data also with e0/f2p cones?

edit: 

looks like the avg cycles only considers e0 characters yeah. at that point idk, I'd be interested in hearing the justification. they should do a better job at explaining the ratings if they have a tier list lol

how was jy rated? characters within a tier are alphabatized it seems
        [deleted]
            why do you assume acheron is rated with her sig in mind?
                If you look at Acheron's character page, you can view the LC assumptions they have on their damage calculations, where, Acheron is assumed to use an S5 version of a gacha LC (good night LC), or her signature LC. She is the only character with damage calcs in the Prywden website using gacha LCs that are not from the welfare Herta store/MOC shop.

I do acknowledge that this does not necessarily confirm that Prywden used the same LC assumptions for ranking purposes, but it at least shows that they are willing to make "special conditions" for certain characters that they don't do for others to hype them up. I actually personally have Acheron at E0 S1 and I know she's one of the few characters that fundamentally change without her signature.

Again, no hate on Prywden -- I would still say that they have useful guides, but just be careful in taking their rankings at face value. Take of that as you will.
QQ is the biggest example of this, she have nothing to do in the same tier than the like of Seele/JY/Ratio. 

Should be A tier maximum.
QQ in S tier is the most obvious example
If you NA on a character turn and someone else follows up (Kafka, Topass, etc.) what's the interaction like? Do both get the point? Only the person hitting?
    It only counts for the one who's hitting the dice
    The follow-up counts for the character who does it. So Kafka/Topaz would get an additional roll there
I feel like there are lots of 4*s like this. Xueyi has RNG with her followup, but if all three hits hit the same target (i.e. there is only one target) it's probably the most damage a 4-star can do currently. I forget if its a trace or eidolon but it can also have universal weakness depletion so if all three hits land the same target, it'll do a lot of weakness damage as well. 

Asta is the same way. Her fire break against a single target is pretty much unmatched, and Sampo too.
    4* are the queens and kings of "i could be SO good if i land my rng attack"
        If yanqings followup is 100% chance instead too
    Everyone with this attack jumping abilities are so good
    Xueyi's E2, and the E1 adds 40% to each hit of her follow up.

So it's 130%x3 that heals 5%, reduces anyone's toughness, and gets buffed by Xueyi's "1:1 Break to DMG%" up to 240%.
    That would be true if QQ didn’t exist, haha… the queen of the highest ceilings and lowest floors
        Very rng dependent tho.
            Just be lucky (Reset the fight until it happens)
        If her FUA triggered on every attack she would be S+ tier.
He is basically 4 star JY
Xueyi
    Still a great choice! She works great in Pure Fiction with anyone who can provide the stacks.
Wouldn't Luka be better to use instead of Bronya? One of them with BE build while other one have standard build.
Her shtick is action advance, large self speed buff and the ability to build crit/BE hybrid, mostly. Generally these two fulfill a similar role but for different teams, with Luka being geared more towards dot teams and Su preferring hypercarry/crit comps so it's mostly down to gameplay preferences or what characters you have or want to build

        That's a really good one!
he literally talks about how he will grow up one day, and is referred to as a child multiple times
    So I was right about him being a kid 😭
Is a serious question? Kids in hotel where pretty common. That is what misha is, a lobby boy

    more commonly a bell boy / bellhop in NA
        In my country they are called buttons
    You can't just post something like that without warning.
        ?? Are you scared of kids in a hotel lmao
        Warning of what? History?
        Warning of what????
    But not nowadays, right? Or this still a thing?
        Today not in developed countries. In some poor countries children with jobs are still a thing.
Also this is way more recent than you think my dad is 62 and he started working at an 5 star hotel at age 15 as a waiter.
            Damn. Sounds hard
                That’s it? We established he absolutely is a child and is referred to as one multiple and you’re essentially like “dam… well anyways”.
        Yeah but Penacony is very much modelled after the time period where they were common
            Indeed penacony has strong 20s or 30s vives. Robin mic is also the very old style use in that time frame.

        This is one of the best movies ever. Grand hotel budapest
            Thats a movie? Okay
                The other is a real picture. But this was common until the 1950s. I shared this picture because this movie os very well know and the best movie depiction of a lobby boy.
    Exactly what I was waiting for following this trend lmao
Acts like a kid, talks a kid, looks like a kid, why even take a chance dude? This isn’t even talking about him literally talking about doing stuff *when he grows up* and he’s referred to as a child multiple times.
westerners have a real hard time dealing with the fact shotacons exist
    Westerners also have a real hard time discerning fiction from reality to begin with but it is what it is.
