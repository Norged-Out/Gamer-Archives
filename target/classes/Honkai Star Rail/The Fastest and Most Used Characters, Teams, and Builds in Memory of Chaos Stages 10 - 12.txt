    battle of PEAK
        Star rail team cooked with the sustainers
To think that they all where called mid before beta
            I hope they cook just as much with Aventurine 🙏
                They sorta have to because of that image. Why would you pull for another sustain unit when, realistically, you only need 2 to clear the endgame content? That's probably their biggest challenge with designing Preservation/Abundance units.

My guess is that he'll lean into adding more damage to the team directly, since one of the LC we got in the new MoC store for Preservation is highly damage focused, which would be useless for all our current Preservation units.
                    They should go for niche characters
                        I think so too, like a DoT sustain or a follow up one for example
                        I'm so torn, because on one hand, I think niche characters are cool since they open up new avenues of gameplay.

On the other hand, someone like Ruan Mei has infinitely more use and pull value for an account than, say, Topaz will. One can be slotted into a lot of teams for optimal or slightly sub-optimal builds, the other can only really interact with FU-focused units.
                            Thats great actually, if every character was like ruan mei and didn’t have a niche there would be a big problem in the game
                                I guess my concern would be "how niche?" 

You don't want characters who are so niche that, outside of one or maybe two teams, they're not very good, because then you get an issue w/ new players (or players who have to pick and choose who to pull) where it's like "Well, I want Black Swan, but I don't want Kafka and \[Third Unit for BS\]" or "Well, I want Black Swan, but I cannot afford to pull for Kafka and \[Third Unit for BS\]."
                    or they'll just make harder content that basically requires you to run the new support
                        Swarm and GaG in a nutshell.

It's not necessarily necessary to have gotten Daniel/Fu Xuan or Argenti, but I'd be lying if it didn't feel like they made it way easier if you didn't have existing, cracked out units built.
                I think they will 
Ans even id he does end up being underwhelming they'll find a way to indurectly buff him with characters and relics
            When ALL are OP. Then no one is. /s/s, if all are OP they still are OP. So it's good for us player base where we can use anyone we like 👍
                All the limited feel op of properly built
This is good cause you can main your fav without many problems (if your fav is a limited)
        love a good PEAK-off
Dr. Ratio being close to the top both solo and team-wise is super great to see!
    The turbulence buff played a huge role to his clear times. Getting a free Bronya adv forward every cycle is really broken, and the rest of the hunt carries (including Jingliu because well, it's Jingliu) greatly benefitted from it as well.

Kafka and the rest of the Erudition units have close to realistic clear times in comparison, considering that they don't benefit from turbulence at all. What's surprising is that both Kafka and Jing Yuan have improved their average cycles in MoC12 when both sides have lightning RES.
        Not really surprising, because this Turbulence buff actually affects their gameplay. The debuffs on enemies matter even if they can't get advanced forward.

Last Turbulence, not being able to Break enemies meant essentially having no Turbulence buff.
        https://preview.redd.it/9n5uk4p4jzec1.png?width=1168&format=png&auto=webp&s=752a11909cd0be85c148566ac9873e8f763dcdd1

I think excluding abominations like the second team helped JY’s average score a lot
            What the fuck were they cooking in rank 185
                It’s a substage 1 btw with almost full lightning-wind res. Maybe it comes from misconception that JY is too weak to fight alone and blade is an excellent sub dps for everyone
                    Avg. cycles: 19 😩😩😩
                my bad
                I was running that team for quite a while tbh. Blade + bronya + luocha + flex works great with most dps. Rn I run jingliu in that spot. Blade doesn't consume any sp , luocha constantly generates them so you want someone else that uses sp to not overflow. JY was my go to for that before jingliu and it was a very consistent way to clear MoC 12 without much risk.
            Holy fuck. Who added that bullshit into the data…
        Yeah, thanks to the turbulance I used a full hypercarry team on Floor 12 with Ruan Mei and Tingyun, no debuffer. Kafka literally did not make any move, it was the first time ever that it happened to me.
    bc they gave buffs to tailored to him hes the strongest for now.
    His team with 4 star supports (Pela and Ting) does way better than with 5 stars one like SW+ Topaz lol

If you replace pela with ruan mei is a bit faster but doesnt appear here for some reason, it does appear on their webpage if you look at raio teams, their appeareance rate is pretty similar so not sure why it doesnt show here tho
        That's because the turbulence that forwards 1 hunt/dest character benefits going full hypercarry. In dual dps this turbulence effects a lower damage contribution from the second dps. That team isn't necessarily better than the other in a vacuum, try it without the turbulence.
            On any of the past turbulances SW + Topaz have perform worst than SW + Tingyun , Tingyun + Pela ,etc

So i was right
Here you can see the reality of the difference between dpses in hsr. For example both sides have lightning resistance enemies, you basically deal 40% less dmg to them. And the difference between JY, Kafka and other dpses is laughable, btw they can't even use half of the MoC buff.

I don't understand why Argenti is noticeably lower than the others tho, I thought it was enough time for people to farm his relics and build his teams.
    Average argenti kinda sucks in 2-target scenario, he benefits from bosses who summon mobs frequently because energy issues.
        It especially sucks for lower investment Argentis because if you're not killing stuff fast enough, the more downtime you spend on trying to battery him even with Tingyun + HH.

I am E0S1 with stacked relics and supports so I don't have an issue, but I can definitely see how the energy deficit vs just 1-2 elites can spiral out of control.
    Moc 12 has no minions. It's tough to get Argenti's ult up when he's only facing 2 enemies at a time. In a sense, he is a volatile dps in MoC unlike JY who doesn't really care about the number of enemies as long as he can clear ads with skill + ult before LL lands. JY also works as a sub dps for Topaz who is really good against the Ebon Deer whereas Argenti is locked in as a hypercarry.
    Yeah the 40% lightning res on both side kinda sucks (which is ironic since Kafka is also on the banner lol)

Then again I still see showcase from different mains able to bruteforce it so I see it as a win game state wise.
    Energy supports. I could have pulled HuoHuo, but having 2 limited sustain units already, getting her just for the ER charge is quite a luxury. If only the energy charger was a 5star harmony..

Now Argenti only has TY taking care of his ult which makes him slow vs the other dpses I play.
    It should be noted there is a side effect of the way the stats are collected that gives a bias to this conclusion. The cleartime for each DPS is a combination of both sides as opposed to only their side.


If you 1 cycle on 1 side and take 4 on the other, thats a 5 cycle for both DPS, the strong will get dragged down and the weak will be lifted up (in my case JL cleared in 0 and Ratio took 3).


As a result all the DPS start to get pushed together for results that will always look similar.


In the pure fiction stats this wasn't the case and as a result we could see Argenti head and shoulders above the rest.


This isn't to say the data isn't useful or should be ignored, just note that the actual cycle differences can be lot larger than the numbers would imply.
    He has energy problems so he needs ideally 5 enemies, one is the boss and the other 4 are very weak.
    That's because you only need to do it in 10 cycles. There's no point in doing it faster even if your team can. And once you get the rewards there's no point in doing it again. We'll never really have reliable data to compare characters because of this.
    Imo, it's because there is no really good f2p euridition light cone. Destructions and the hunts herta light cones have only light a 5 to 10 percent damage decrease compared to other signature light cones. There is no f2p euridition light cone on that level.

Maybe it's just me, but that is how I fell whenever I use a f2p lightcone on himeko, qq, or argenti.
        >Destructions and the hunts herta light cones have only light a 5 to 10 percent damage decrease compared to other signature light cones.

No they're not. It depends on the character. Here is the damage difference referenced by Prydwen:

Jingliu - 15% from S5 Aeon

Blade - 32% from S1 Secret Vow

DHIL - 13% from S5 Aeon

Ratio - 12% from S5 Cruising

And here's the damage difference for limited Erudition units. I included the BP light cone for low spenders (it's the only good BP light cone):

Argenti - 15% from S5 Breakfast, 4% from S5 Peaceful Day

Jing Yuan - 17% from S5 Breakfast, 7% from S5 Peaceful Day

As you can see, Blade has the worst light cone selections, as his "F2P" option is a gacha light cone.
            Fair enough.
    Argenti is a PF god but exceedingly mid at MoC which is filled with two elite scenarios.
I've just implemented the exclusion of slow dual DPS teams from the average cycles calculation. As I've explained in my previous MoC post, turns out there are more players using dual carry for Jing Yuan (25%) than most other carries (Jingliu 6%, Sele 15%, Dan Heng IL 17%, etc). And that 25% isn't even counting Jing Yuan + Topaz teams, so those are teams like Jing Yuan + Clara and Jing Yuan + Blade. Which was why I decided to exclude those teams.

For example, if Seele + Blade dual carry is slower than Seele's average cycle or Blade's average cycle, then Seele + Blade is excluded. Topaz follow-up, Kafka DoT, and Ruan Mei teams are still included. This is also explained on the first slide's footnote. Here's an image showing how the average cycles changed with the exclusion of dual DPS.

Also, I attached the histograms of cycles for each of stages 10 - 12 on the last three slides.

    Thanks for your work
    Highly appreciate it! 
    Thanks for adding the histograms w/ averages for each floor!
Clara still up there. Nice. 

Wish I could get her.
    I'm rather surprised to see Clara doing so well. I only played during launch and had a lot of fun with the counter/follow-up attack playstyle.
It's wild to see every time DPSes averaging 70+/160+ CR/CD. I can't get this much even with rainbow set.

        "laughably easy"? Its possible but it by no means easy...
            [deleted]
                So never spent on refresh is your benchmark for "laughably easy"? okay then...

Cause for me, if someone say it's easy I figure it as 1 week of farming relic.
        "Yada yada, yall are pathetic. What's so hard getting these stats? Just lucksack it."

Ya jackass, you're talking like the gear substats are guaranteed to drop, and rolls go to the correct stats you're looking for. Shut the fuck up. Im already lucky if i can fully gear a character in 3 weeks without fuel refills.
        >idk how long you have been playing

Since day one

>just grind the domains

I do. Crits are so rare. I get only CR or CD at best and then everything goes into another substat.

>there are people with like 75/200+ ratios

Whales ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
            i doubt the majority of even whales are spending money to grind out relics like that. it just takes time - it took me 5 weeks to get a decent ratio set (70-200) and even longer to get an argenti set. you just need to commit to farming for one unit instead of spreading yourself too thin
                This is exactly the point I was trying to make, it’s really not hard to get artifacts it’s just not instant
            Look, i think you’ve been farming other things, which is completely optimal for guaranteed upgrades. But how could you not have been stuck on the quantum domain for at least four months. Or really insert any domain. If its because of the characters you have guess thats understandable for whatever enjoyment you want.

Getting 64/180, 80/160 is really just the most serviceable amt of ratios you need.

I played star rail first couple ptches, stopped couple months and came back. Given I only hyperinvest two teams, I have two dpses with a solid 90/200 and 60/200. Didnt spend a penny on jacksht
                I farmed quantum first two months of the game. The best I got is 53.4/144.1. And since release of 1.5 I farm FUP/DoT domain. My Topaz has wild 57.4/120.6.

Like look at Seele. With her traces she has 5/74 at base. We are trying to get 75/200. With crit rate body and 8% from planar set we still need 29.6 CR just from substats. For CD even if you have 5\* LC with 30 CD you still need 78.6% from substats to achieve 200.

Getting 29.6 CR and 78.6 CD from substats AT THE SAME TIME is insanely lucky.
                    He must be talking about Jingliu. Except of her, a 80/160 ratio is not easy to achieve. Possible, especially with outside buffs, but definitely not "everyone has it". Unless of course you play rainbow set, but that is only a good trade if their set is shit to begin with.


Of all my chars, only Ratio achieves this without their signature LC. 
                        No my highest rated one is seele, next is Imbibitor. The hardest sht i find hard to farm was a helm piece somehow.
                    Now its entirely possible you dont get sht for a year for a set, but the likelihood from you just spamming raimbow sets should net you at least close to 70/160. Idk maybe a select few of you out there are really unlucky but odds are you’ll get these stats eventually. Pickup smth else and have fun. Or go do whatever. 

These relic stats will be just a dent on your probable lifetime in this game.
                These stats are luck dependent. You could be like me where I had many many potential godly roll pieces, but they always roll flat stats. I have maxed out my relic inventory several times and crafted many relics. I could not get stats like that on any combination of my relics. Even so I still cleared everything in this game so even with trash stats and 4 star lightcones you can beat everything.

Not sure what a lot of relic farming is but I did some 700 or so relic calyx runs.
        Pls link your account I'd like to look it up. 75/200 is hardly possible without grinding for months + whaling for theirsignature  Edit:  
> I am a day 1 Genshin impact player that has spent welkin, bp and maxed bonus crystal rewards every time they reset    


> I’ve spent more on Honkai star rail and have appreciated the generous nature of the devs to support it even more.  


As I thought. Dude is a whale haha.
    [deleted]
        How the fuck it's not much? 140 is not much and even this is difficult to achieve
            [deleted]
                >If you get 10% cd per other pieces

Yeah, easy. Especially easy because I also need CR at the same time
Honestly still in half-disbelief that Dr Ratio at the state he was in was given out for free. He's been so fun *and* strong!
    I'm still worried about how he will perform after this cycle ends ngl. My only reliable debuffers are Pela and Welt and using only one still didn't do well for me and using both means I either have to ditch sustain or ditch harmony which will sink his dmg even further. What are the current best budget options he has right now?
        Best budget options are E1 Guinaifen (with the Luka LC) and E4 Pela (with Luka LC). They can both guarantee his follow-up attack within a single team slot, which is the main requirement for Ratio to succeed.
        With Pela and TY he's pretty good, you can try him in previous moc 12
        Welt sustain is always an option (especially if you have RM). The enemy hardly ever had a turn when I used him that way on floor 12
    Yeah I was worried he'd get nerfs for being free but glad he's getting the full premium treatment with a full powered kit and a catered MoC
Topaz and ratio are so fun to use together i imagine her rerun is gonna do very well crazy that they gave away such a strong character for free that i’d say you don’t need DHIL if you have him, also jingliu has been at the top cuz every moc since her release has had on side that favored her tho i have a feeling it will change soon, my girl seele is still great and is gonna skyrocket when hanabi releases I imagine
    i started the game week ago and did consider going for dhil but since i have welt and ratio i can skip him without regretting right ?
        Yeah you won’t need him at all since you have Welt and Ratio. It will be a lot better for you to save for either a DPS of a different element or a good support.
            my goal for now is getting sparkle since i use qinque a lot and i heard she will be like bronya which im desperate for. and i have no idea when i will lose my 50 50 to her. other units im aiming to get are jingliu and fu xuan i hope they are good characters to aim for. (i would like luocha too but i dont think i will have enough jades for him)
                Those are all going to be really good characters, sounds like you have a great plan!
                    thanks i try to avoid making mistakes for first couple months at least
                Sparkle is good in general though i wouldn’t recommend using qinque until she’s atleast e4 (ideally e6) shes pretty meh before then, i recommend getting aventurine cuz he’s preservation limited so an automatic pull and another good dps could be really any other future character but Aventurine for sustain and sparkle for support can never go wrong
                    ill get her to e4 on sparkle banner hopium    tbh im not interested in aventurine even if he turns out great cuz i need to collect some waifus first hehe maybe on his rerun
                        Have you seen the new music video? Bro is cool but if you dont want to  then you’ll have to wait for either fu xuan or huo huo for sustain
                >i would like luocha too but i dont think i will have enough jades for him

Don't worry, his rerun will be in version 3.4 at the very least.

(Yes, I'm salty his rerun got postponed)
        For gameplay yes, but it's never a waste to roll for a character if you like them.
            hes really fun i would like to get him but its quite expensive to get every character i want :(
        I'd say yeah.

You got enough Imaginary coverage. So getting a DPS for an element you're missing or maybe getting a strong Harmony support would be more beneficial than Dhil.
        Never listen to people that claim dhil stronger than Ratio thingy, only go for dhil if you like Dan Heng, of course.
        Dan il is worth  if you plan to get his E2, at that point has more damage than ratiop in single target and a fuck ton more as soon as theres 2 or more enemys present

Ratio is good but it  struggles hard as soon as theres more than 2 enemys on the field , so he is lock to MoC pretty much , Dan il can be play on any game mode witouth issues

  
BUT... you probably better covering other roles if you new, mainly strong supports, like sparkle soon enough
    Huo Huo too, battery is really good for Ratio make him able to spam more wiseman's folly talent, fua fua and more fua, everyone got's the chalk


aand that's why it got the fastest clear
        Yeah, honestly at this point i think alot of people are realizing how good she is and as long as sp isn’t an issue shes better than luocha in every way
            Well yeah, if you take away luocha's main strength(super sp positive) he becomes worse than HH. That's exactly why they are different and they both have their uses
            Its also why HuoHuo with DHiL is very feast or famine. Either you just utterly crush the enemy with ults or you eventually blow out your sp economy. But man when you get DHIL Tingyun and HuoHuo in a team with someone like Yukong and everyone is speed tuned to make things happen… the damage is gross.
    Ratio + pela and ting is way stronger than his Topaz teams as shown on this data, so not worth to waste so many jades to get a worst team tbh
I have Jingliu and love her, but please Hoyo, no more ice weak enemies in MoC
    No fr. I don’t have her, I only have Pela and March. March technically is a support unit but her attack is equal to Pela for me?! I low key neglect my MoC because of it. IL, TB, and Sampo are my big damage dealers, but the latest update has me speed running Pela into a sleeper agent
    >!2.0 moc don't have alot of ice weak enemies!<
Tingyun always performs better than Bronya in Seele teams
    Secure to kill minions is important in her cycle, using ult with her in some cases is like an extra turn too.
    She's just that good. Equip her with DDD ult early and suddenly even your slowest dps can act 2 times in the first cycle
    For low investment.
I always wondered why don't more people build multiplication on Luocha? Isn't that like his best LC after sig?
    I'm an avid Perfect Timing user and it's just due to the effect res stat where even Kafka has a hard time dominating him. Auto heal comes in clutch most of the time.
        I can understand this mindset. If you have enough speed subs lying around or when loucha’s speed and sp gen dont matter cause you have enough sp, just go comfy haha dominate what btch
            Luocha*
    Thanks for the reminder that i should build that lc for him one of these days.


Though in my case, i just wanted him to be tankier so he has bailu's sig lc. (i dont have bailu, i also... Have welts too now and no welt lol) 
    I had Multiplication on him for a time but switched it off him because his defense was too low with it. I went from him never dying to consistently getting one shot in the upper MoCs and simulated universe with Multiplication.

Figured there was no point in Luocha action advancing if he was dead so switched him to Perfect Timing and never looked back
    It is but honestly I play mine with Jingliu and Blade so they don't need the heavy sp generation

I recently got perfect timing I can finally say no to Kafka dominate it's quite funny
    What’s multiplication?
        A 3-star Abundance Cone, at S5 the wearer gets Advanced Forward by 20% everytime they use their Basic Attack
    Nah, it depends on your play style. If you don't have hardcore HP/DEF stats on Luocha, he becomes too weak with Multiplication. Also, an effect res build with Perfect Timing is excellent against high-CC bosses. And Bailu's sig works great if you want him tankier.
    Because he becomes hell squishy with it. Very low base stats
    My Luocha is already fast enough and i don't like base stats of 3* LC. Perfect Timing is what i like.
King Yuan and Queen Kafka cannot be stopped by a measly 40% lighting res. Waytoobased.
    Makes me wonder if they're gonna release enemies that are straight up immune to Lightning like the stupid thunderbirb in Genshin.
        I doubt they will.
Seele still performing great , guess the power creep reports were greatly exaggerated as always.
    Seele - always lose in excel calculations but win the actual fight
        Consistency is Seele's second name, rules are meant to be broken as always
        i mean they straight up calc her dmg without accounting for her resurgence at all lmao
        Excel calculations ≠ Actual gameplay

Folks need to realize this as there's many factors that an ally can ult earlier than the simulated numbers
            It’s even worse for Seele’s case because resurgence gives her extra turn and basic attack advances her forward (which you use quite often when you play Seele) so there’s no way to reliably calculate the overall damage she’s getting from all the turn manipulation without making several assumptions.
    Seele, silverwolf is going to be the best option if you don't have the element until the next 5* quantum damage dealer.
        I can't hear you over the qingqillion sound of qingqillion damage
            Did she ever outclass Seele in average cycles?
                no lol, as much as people love qq she is not better than seele (and QQ feels bad to play, Sparkle may fix this)
                    Sparkle can give her skill pts but can't fix her randomness. And her problem is not even skill pts.
                Nope. Even though her appearance rate is significantly lower which gives her an advantage.
                    There was a MoC, probably during DHIL release where the blessing was amazing for QQ, which makes sense since she works nearly the same as DHIL.

I switch them around depending how I feel anyway since both work, QQ gameplay is still the most fun in the game imo tho.

Fuck it we draw
                        You are probably talking about one of QQ’s teams performing better than a Seele team during that MOC cycle because QQ has never been above Seele in the average MOC cycle chart.
            The QQ sect exists only in reddit, Seele remains as queen 👑
            This ain't simulated universe
    But people told me Seele was going to get powercrept months ago! It's always her turn in everything except falling out of the meta!
        Even in 1.0 Jing Yuan wanters keep saying Seele users are gonna regret pulling when Jing Yuan power crept her.
            I regret not pulling JY because his kit is cool as hell
    And the constant Quantum team posts where it's always QQ in the past few days/weeks.
        She needs her blessings of propagation
            People love to shit on Seele for some reason, especially the QQ sect.
                They're mad they don't have her
                    Me having both, enjoying QQ gamba for SU and Seele if MoC gets too serious, though in the end both work.

Can't wait for sparkle for true monoquantum tho
                I see that same sentiment from Seele mains towards QQ. Which is fine, but doesn't make Seele mains stand out as better than those.
                    The Seele main call deluded QQ sect on their bullshit and lie their spread to shit on Seele, they don't shit on other character.

Can end up a little heated sometime but not a surprise a lot of people are fed up with QQ sect bullshit because they can't accept that E6 QQ can't compete with Seele in any category and with any limited 5\* dps.
                        I mean I would agree with you that bashing of a character feels wrong. I wouldn't want Seele to be bashed without reason and knowledge as well, but saying QQ E6 is worse than any limited 5\* dps is so wrong.

If we are talking about PF I completely agree. If we are talking about MoC, then no. You are basing that on? Let me know.
                            The only limited DPS that is worse than her in MoC is Argenti due to his mechanics (hates 1-2 targets w/o summons)
                    Ehh we're more busy calling each other or Seele frauds, suffering from shitty relic gacha and shipping seele with Bronya to care about QQ
                        Well, I've looked at the recent QQ post on the front page of this sub. That may altered my impression. 
                            are you sure, those post either exclude Seele's existence as a mono quantum character or present QQ as a top tier character even though she is the incarnation of gacha itself and not always reliable.
                                Nobody cares if she is always reliable or not. People like playing her because of the gamble part. But even then, her average is pretty reliable already. People are shitting on the character without much thought and rehash the same problems people said before people caught on that she actually is very good. Of course not Jingliu/DHIL good, nobody should debate that.

Also I don't understand how that post should include Seeles existence if it is specifically how QQ got buffs nearly every patch. Seele mains just come in and say "actually Sparkle is a big buff for Seele as well" which nobody debated. But somehow there is a need to go in shit on the character, praise Seele and then leave? There are good quantum options even without Seele and not every quantum post must involve her. Granted, I find the people who are commenting under every Seele thing a QQ copypasta or similar thing irritating as well.

If I look into most post histories of people commenting hate to QQ, I see them posting on Seele mains a lot or have some other connection to her, than it is so obvious what is happening. That's literally my point I made and that still stands as strong as ever.
                                    Not the amount of money posts of quantum girls that happen to exclude seele? Which are obviously passive aggressive attacks on her considering that everyone is quantum, you're just attention seekers that are mad at something, don't really care what is it about
        Dont worry. Everyone is going to realize that Seele is better with Sparkle anyway. Let them cope. (Note this does not apply to Propagation spam QQ in SU. Shes stupid in that mode. This is coming from a quantum dps main who literally has a built Seele, QQ, and Xueyi  just because I like them. Lol)
    Welcome to the immortal 1.0 powercreep roach. Naysayers cant kill her.
    Yes but as you can see it needs FX apparently, so it a yes, but for premium mono Quantum 


Dual carry quantum with FX/SW, viable 


Dual sustain quantum, viable 


But so far no Lynx only sustain, no SW/Seele/Lynx/flex nor SW/Selee/Lynx/Xueyi or QQ


Hanabi come out soon, So yeah she won't go anywhere, extra premium mono quantum comp gonna be real good. 


Hope Lynx can replace or temp subs FX hmm
        I can solo sustain with Lynx, but it lose a lot of damage
        All three premium sustains are sitting on the utilization table. This isnt a lynx issue. Its people not really using any of the other 4 star sustains in general except for niche uses like Lynx blade
The Powercreep in this game is so bad that two 1.0 units are among the top…. 🌚
My boy Luka is top 3 dps for MoC 12, so proud of him.

https://preview.redd.it/tnwv45ldezec1.png?width=976&format=png&auto=webp&s=544cb89f57874a4dd199efe32a74a82cf9b13c3f
    Brake effect Luka is honestly insane
        In the new event Despair mode he can kill an entire bar of Bronya/Gepard before they recover from break. It's hilarious.
        Break effect Luka? Sound interesting. I should build him. I'm guessing it's just about stacking attack and break effect?
            Yep, you should definetly try it, even a mid-investment build is impressive
            Yes, just stack as much BE as possible and time his attacks to break physical weak enemies. Bleed with lots of BE stacked is very strong, so he does work that way as a sub-DPS.
        Yeah. And Ruan Mei buffed him a lot. I've seen a video of him 0-cycling the Deer (current floor 12). Tried to recreate it myself, and it was one of the easiest 0-cycles I've ever had. His 200k-300k break hits are no joke.
            Does he need constellations ?
                His e6 helps if you are aiming for 0-cycling. But he can work even at e0.
            what is the build? i have him c6 but never used bc i dont care for dot teams and figured he was dot related?
                You basicly just stack break effect. As much as you can. His relics sets and planar sets don't really matter: Musketeer, Prisoner, Thief, 2+2 combo, Talia, SSS, Glamoth - anything works. All you need is to plan your actions - to ensure he is the one who lands break hits.

My Luka has 2.7k atk, 192% BE, 139 spd. 4pc Musketeer and 2pc Glamoth, LC - s5 Fermata. Not optimal, but works anyway.
                    What team works with him?
                        His current best teammates are:

1. Ruan Mei (break efficiency) - it takes less hits to break enemies.
2. SW - deals a lot of toughness damage, applies physical weakness, shreds defence.
                    [deleted]
                        Leveling up his talent definitely wouldn't hurt. Also, his a6 trace synergies very well with his e6 (if you have it) - for extra bleed dmg triggering.
                            [deleted]
                                His enhanced basic attack makes all bleed effects deal damage immediately; break bleed included. Leveling his talent will increase the triggering damage.
why is Jingliu no sustain excluded from ranked by average cycles? appearance rate rank tells me it has 4.91 average cycles which would be faster than ratio hc
    As explained on top of the slide, only teams used at least 5 times on each of the stages 10 - 12 are included in the list.
        ah didnt see the "each stage"! good work on the data love to see it
Stand proud Kafka mains, you'll be strong
The sudden improvements in clear times for most of the cast prove how much of a unit check the previous MOC was. Also, Prydwen better put ma boy Luka in S+ tier for, according to their stats, carrying floor 12 /hj
Love how Daniel is falling abit not because he's bad but the cycle doesn't favor him much unless you have good SP management
    More like the buffs straight up counter him. He gets forwarded with no SP left and has to BA and waste his turn
    So you saying cycle doesn't favor him, but a lots of folk calling his E2 op for some reason which are pretty much does the same thing as this turbulence.
        The turbulence forwards him when you have no SP left. Not much to do in that situation.

His E2 forwards him and gives him a free fully enhanced basic attack. Huge difference.
        You're ignoring the fact IL's Ult provides 3 Squama Stacks which are basically 3 SPs while the Turbulence pulls him up with no extra SPs to work with


I did comfortably clear the second half using 3 cycles with IL but I had to use normal Basic Attack multiple times which only really made me waste Tingyun buff turns
            It is just a 100% forward with 1 more addtional sp, meanwhile Ratio E2 is free massive damage, no turn spending required, so buff is retained and not using sp.
                Lol "just" 💀
                    Well you see what that "just" did for him in this MoC
                        Missed the part about the e2 giving him a free 3BA?

You cannot read
        LOL tell me you dont know what E2 dan doesn witouth telling me 

His E2 push him forward but also give him 3 skill point to use, thats the big differencem this turbulence advanc him forward and your are stuck doing a normal auatoatack , pretty useless
        His E2 gives him the three SP he needs to instantly attk. This is very different from having your attk timing completely botched by getting forwarded before your team can generate SP.
        His E2 gives him SP after the ult, the MOC turbulence doesn't.
        Learn what his E2 actually does before blabbering out of your ass. It literally directly counters him with this current turbulent blessings
        Sorry i didn't make my question clear, why is E2 Dan consider op and not a single person calling Ratio E2 op yet?
Shouldn't this be 1.6.2? The image says 3 for some reason
    Sorry, I mistakenly counted PF as 2
Im pretty an endgame player 3 star all moc 12 etc, and my first dps is QQ.

Can someone tell me how from this data, her average crit is 70%+ with her avg critd 137%+ while her most light cone (breakfast and BP) as well as set (quantum) give 0 crit?

If with crit rate chest, i find it extremely hard to reach high critd. And if i go with critd chest, its simply extremely hard to hot 70+ critc.

So how is her average critc is 70+ and her critd is 137++?

I really want to improve her, but i simply cannot reach those numbers combined. Whats the stat spread on each piece to achieve such numbers??
    People farm relics for many months to reach those numbers. LCs help too but it's completely realistic to reach those numbers for day one players who've been dumping their stamina every day and not trashing pieces with potential (if you have ten pieces with one line of crit, one of them will probably be good)
    probably people using jing yuan or argenti sig LCs that give 36 cdmg and 8 crit from rutilant arena

that gives you 13/86 at which point all you need is a crit chest and double crit pieces on all gear 

people have had since launch to work on QQ so there's going to be a lot of people that just spent a lot of time relic farming for her
        Fair enough, though i played every single day since i joined the game and bought every single bp, i only joined during Fu banner, was mid Sep i think. I farmed quite a bit the quant for both QQ and Jing together, but prolly not enough compared to day 1 players when it comes to quant set fatm
            My biggest regret in this game was not getting Jing Yuan light cone. It has been painful farming for relics to get the appropriate amount of crit when his light cone would instantly fix all my problems. It is like a cheat code that saves you 4 months of farming or more.

    "We heard you." - HoYo

\*Casually puts lightning res enemies on both sides.
        Nah they wouldn't do that to Acheron, she's the Raiden expy after all !
            "Fine, we'll have 1 patch with Lightning weakness. After that we're going back to form" - HoYo
    Need downfall for both ice and imaginary dps and let other elements shines in some moc
    Imagine Cocolias on both sides. Jingliu users had their fun for 3 patches in a row. Time to fuck them over just like how they did with lightning lmao
        [deleted]
            The deer should've been a cocolia side, Kafka is literally right there on banner atm. The deer is the most random choice ever...
                Idk why they keep pestering us with that dumb plant. Always found the deer annoying

    Same the entire thing is flooded with ice weakness. Make cocolia on one side and the fat dude and chainsaw man ice res dudes on the other side.
    Even against Ice RES enemies, Jingliu's capacity to brute force is quite high. 


Even more if you own Ruan Mei. 
        Also helps that one of the best f2p friendly debuffers in the game (pela) is able to ice res down AND synergizes explosively with the quantum set.
    Cocolia and Yanqing both sides

On the floor before that is Gepard and lets hope Sam will also resist to ice

Problem is she still probably has fairly high usage since until foreseable future she is the only premium ice DPS. By the time Acheron released there are 3 already for ligthning. Both DHIL and Blade also has Ratio and Black Swan already as premium new dps for their elements
        [deleted]
            Not really, you could just spam SP to attack just to remove that mechanic
    jingliu mains are laughing they already abused it for many months. plus she needs only e0.
        She dont need that shit either. Woman gets more than a free crit rate body worth of crit rate for practically free and a truck load of attk. Her damage floor is disgusting.
    Keep crying
        Well too bad, Jingliu havers are gonna be the ones crying. Because out of the 10 new Penacony mobs, only 3 of them are weak to ice.

Not to mention that neither of the 2 new bosses are weak to ice (but they both have lightning weakness lol)
            They have quantum weakness so she does get 20% Def shred
                So does every other dps with the quantum set. Not matching the element also mean you can break the ennemy shield effectively. Not to mention the 20% ice resistance they have.
                    The Res is cancelled because of the set. It's a no weakness no Res enemy for JL,the other dps do have quantum set but they have better relic sets. JL has the worst relic options in the game
            I mean, having ice weak enemies only meant breeze clears for Jingliu. I personally want more challenge and have SW anyways :\

It was just weird to me to wish for a character to drop down
                >It was just weird to me to wish for a character to drop down

I personally understand the feeling, if the meta is always the same for a long time it starts to get boring, having variety is good !
                    Agree :)
    You also just have to realize that jingliu’s damage floor being so high hard carries people who are f2p and dolphins with low eidolons (this impacts the data in her favor). With the free Attk% and 50% crit rate she can literally get to endgame with some of the most mid relics ever.
adding sparkle to mono quantum i can only see seele usage and clear speed being higher in future moc, it seems like quantum would be the future proof team to build after all
    Not only that you can always just switch out Silverwolf for another buffer like Ruan Mei or Tingyun whenever the enemy is on Quantum
And people STILL say that Jing Yuan is bad lmao. Being so high when he doesn't benefit from the MoC buff for hunt and destruction characters, and this moc cycle is very bad for electro chars.
bUt iN stAr RaiL, yOu neEd tHe laTeSt cHarActeRs tO fiNisH enDgaMe cOntEnT, tHat'S wHy thEy aRe mOrE gEneRoUs~
    I know right. Its not like the 1.0 dps still sits near the top irregardless of element coverage /s
Is Topaz good with Ratio even if the enemy isn't weak to Fire?
    she gives dmg bonus on FUA and her dumb goes forward with ratio's FUA so yes it's free dmg and single target, which is what ratio does
    she does decent damage even without fire weakness, great sub dps
    Yes
    Sub DPS support kinda like some builds of SW
    Not really, you better off with Pela, Ting and ruan mei any combination of those are stronger than topaz on any of those spots, if you lack those 3 then yeha she works but is far from the best option
        Nah, Topaz is better than Pela starting at S1, she has a 50% FUA damage increase and 24%crit damage AND personal good damage versus 40%def shred for Pela. The only reason you would use Pela is if you really need an SP generator. Heck, SW is a better option if you just need a debuffer.

If you look at the CN chart, the TY, Topaz, Ratio, Huohuo team is the 3rd highest after no sustain JL and DHIL.
            Like i say now with a lot more data Topaz is worst than most combination of Pela, ting and ruan mei consistently, it has being the case on every MoC so far ... so seems i was right
            CN data takes into account all eidolons so any team with multiple 5 stars is gonna be on top as they can have a lot of team with all E6 skewing the data , Tthe data we have here is a lot more representative of normal f2p - low spender players

So for normal people Ting + pela is stronger tna Topaz + SW as shown here , you need eidolons and/or signature lighctones for the other comp to be stronger , pela + ting is literally plug and play witouth using a single pull

  
Like i have E2 S1 Dan IL , for a E2 S1 he is probably the strongest dps, would i call him the strongets dps when talking in a reddit thread about MoC statistics that are meant for F2P ? not at all , same thing for thos ecomps, if they need multiple 5 stars and signature lightcones to be a bit better than characters you get for free then their pull value is pretty low
    She's good but not best in slot until maybe E1S1. Tingyun, Huohuo, and either Pela or RM are likely his best teammates for most people.
I really need to pick up Topaz on her rerun. Nice to see her enabling both meta and off-meta characters.
How is Ratio with Pela/TY clearing faster than with Topaz/SW? Also Blade hypercarry clearing faster than Seele hypercarry?
    > Also Blade hypercarry clearing faster than Seele hypercarry? 

Look at usage rate. I suspect those who use Blade in wind-res environment are more skilled/invested than who use Seele hypercarry (4x times more usage percent)
        Yeah this is perhaps it. Blade is my favourite character and I love to see him doing well but I'm under no delusion that he performs better than Seele.
            Well this data is 10-12 floor combined he’s excellent on floor 11, so it’s may be it as well
                This is what annoys me about their data. Just focus on floor 12.
                    And 3* clears
    The action forward turbulence benefits hypercarry. Topaz teams have less Ratio damage but similar or higher team damage, meaning the turbulence works against this kind of team.
    I honestly want explanation on this as well since I tried my Ratio with Topaz and SW and also with Tingyun and Pela, and he dealt more damage with the 4 stars plus he gets his ult faster
        Tingyun gives massive a buffs and energy so that’s already something
I think MoC has the thing where it puts like 8 debuffs on the enemy? SW becomes over redundant at that point. You need more buffers then anything to get massive damage. HuoHuo is also there and she gives energy and huge atk buff on ult plus refunds Tingyun a bit. Pela honestly feels the most replaceable in the team, you could swap her out for Topaz and get about the same result if said enemy was weak to fire anyway.

All that energy gives Ratio more ults and more follow ups which means more damage versus more debuffs that diminish due to the MoC turbulence.

Edit: Also another thing to think about is supports are built to be quick. They’ll atk multiple times to generate sp, with the right amount of debuffs the follow up becomes basically guaranteed which means fast = more damage

This is my assumption anyway
            I tested both teams not on the current MoC, but the last reset before it so there is no debuff turbulence but yeah more energy really is amazing on Ratio
                If it was done on the last MoC then it's most likely the energy gain just outweighs the benefits of Debuffs which feels crazy to say. Just more Tingyun/HuoHuo Stonks I suppose
    The blessing helps Blade a ton. The extra turn allows you to sync your biggest hits with Bronya's buff/ult fairly easily. Seele gets very little benefit from an unbuffed extra turn where she likely can't one shot.

SW has always been worse than Pela for fast clears - she won't be able to keep up with Ratio if he's killing targets fast enough. Topaz also just doesn't provide enough compared to Tingyun until maybe E1S1, Ratio benefits a lot from energy.
    Pela can do her job without using SP, SW can't

Ratio getting extra turns every cycle + TY refreshing her buff more often because of said extra turns means Pela's SP positivity is more beneficial

similar issue with seele, the turbulence gives her too many turns so most of her attacks end up being unbuffed or out of sync with the other supports

also these later fights are dual elite fights with 0 adds for extra resurgence options, seele is the only hunt that doesn't prefer pure ST fights
        I don't think SP is the main reason that team is performing better. Ratio is of course SP- , TY is SP+, SW is SP neutral and HH can be played SP+. Even if TY's buff runs out quicker and she drops down to being SP neutral, the team, theoretically, should not be facing any SP issues.
        I also think Pela's better ult uptime plus aoe shred lets her keep up with ratio better bcs he kills a single target so quick that SW struggles to keep up her ult def shred up against duo elites.

I think it's fairly ridiculous that my pela with only an energy regen rope alongside luka LC using technique plus skill can get her ultimate on her first turn, while my SW with tutorial and energy regen plus 5% from penacony set doing the same thing can't (pela becoming sp positive completely afterward doesnt help). I wish they'd change it so she can tbh, her energy cost is prob the most painful part about her bcs it forces me to save her ult meanwhile I don't hesitate to use pela's ult when i have it up.
Yanqing isn't even here...
Trying my best out here with no newer broken support or dps...

gotta say yanqing was actually useful in this moc 12... was only able to 3 star it with his help (he was faster than my seele and blade hypercarry teams)... sorry I doubted you my son, yanking on top

Shoutouts to the 18 people who raised Danny Boy to the top of the charts.
I hope that dude who kept saying that Luocha is outclassed by FX and HH take a good hard look at this post
    [deleted]
        Wait, people think Luocha is worse than Fu Xuan or HuoHuo?

I don’t own any of them, but each of them has their own separate utilities lol.

Luocha can basically AFK heal. FuXuan makes your team almost unkillable. HuoHuo makes a majority of debuffs worthless.

I don’t think its fair to compare them, but hey. JY gets shit on for a bunch of reasons so I am not surprised Luocha also gets shit on too.
            >I don’t think its fair to compare them

But it is. They fight for the same spot. If I have to build two teams and need one sustain per team, I have to make a choice between them.

Luocha heals a lot and is SP positive but FX and HH have other gimmicks that make them overall more valuable (HH has ATK buff and energy regeneration - and becomes SP neutral at E1, FX has crit rate and damage split).
            Well he not cute.
            The advantages FX and Huohuo have are their crit rate and Atk/energy buffs. Luocha has SP positivity but that's rarely if ever needed if you're clearing quickly. Running a cloud set (which Huohuo's best in slot regardless) gives you some extra leeway too.

Luocha's definitely better than Huohuo for sustaining your team but is overkill once your team has enough investment.
            Ok, here's a serious answer, he have no future. his Eidolon are too crappy compare to Fu Xuan or Huohuo.
my girl topaz top 3, you love to see it <3
What does the numbers in brackets denotes (2.37) etc
    Standard deviation, per what it says in the first image
God, I hated the turbulence buff for DHIL this time. It was straight up a nerf most of the time if I didn't use Bronya with him.
    Even with bronya is extremely disruptive. One of the few times I switched off dhil specifically because of how obnoxious it was
    Nerf? Since when was a guaranteed extra turn a nerf regardless of speed?.

Don't actually try to 3BA every turn. It screws rotations yes but play around it not force the typical strats always
        You said it yourself. It screws with rotations and buff uptime.
Question does the appearance rate exclude runs with 5star eidolons aswell?
    No, it doesn't
    yk being one of the most used is enough to tell us that people are running eidolons lol. I have seen a single guy play yk without E6 and she was mostly a 2nd dps, not even a support at that point.
        I mean I did say 5 star eidolons... I asked because i believe the cycles only take e0 5stars into account so was wondering if the same is for appearance rate. I know 4 stars with eidolons arent excluded coz thats just doesn't makes sense.
Himeko still got me a 7 cycle clear here. Honestly, my biggest issue was the second side since I didn't have the mats to level Ratio. Ended up doing two cycles against the deer and finally got my Kafka team to give a 5 cycle clear against Kafka and robo-girl.
what is my team if i use dhil, blade, and jingliu all in one team?
    [deleted]
        thats my go-to team though 🥲
    Blade and Jingliu are a great combo, add in a support like pela or Ruan mei and a sustain, I don't know about DHIL though
        i don't have RM. tho i do have bronya. idk if she's a good match for  jingliu
            She is! Bronya is good with everyone really
                oh thanks. time to build my bronya now
I find it very weird that the "fastest" teams are all with sustainers while the real fastest teams - the ones finishing in 0 cycles literally can't have sustainers because they'd lack the damage otherwise.
ive always wanted to ask about this. how can the average clear be >5? so most people basically fail to 3 star extremely badly? why even bother then? to mess up data collection? like salary or size surveys, those who submit their data tend to be on the better side, so its skewed positively, but here, it looks like the average does poorly.
    [deleted]
        so they use the same team on both sides and add their total cycle used?
    Its for both side , >10 would be not a 3 star clear
        so the last picture, the one of dan heng who used a median of 7.5 cycles. Means the average dan heng player player used 3.75 cycles 1st and 2nd side?
            Kinda yes , its a bit skewed since its only 18 submissions tho ; so not really the average Dan heng i'd say
                thank you for taking the time to answer. I always thought it was weird and assumed it was just subside 1 or 2. wish they could average for each side.
                    Unfortunately it's not possible with the data that we have, which comes from Hoyolab. Until Hoyolab updates their data (very unlikely), we'll keep showing this kind of data.
Dr. Ratio is too good.
Clara? Really? Is she really that good? 

I have her and her LC but I'm not 100% convinced yet that i should build her as a main dps.
    she's match up dependent but she's really good on bosses that attack twice and fast like kafka
        So should i bother building her? Or wait to pull for a better dps? I'm thinking Dan Heng.
            if you want a strong physical dps and tolerate her counter based gameplay then yes

the only other competition she has in that role is argenti and sushang but you also don't *need* a physical dps
                I found pairing her with Lynx is pretty good, since Lynx makes enemies focus her so she procs her attacks way more often specially with ult. 

But yeah idk if i want to heavily invest into a physical dps. Maybe pair her WITH Dan Heng so she tanks some damage from him? Build her tank-ish? But would that mess with his "optimal" team? Whatever that is...
                    she doesn't need any tank stats you just always build like a normal crit dps

you can pair her with other dps too yeah, she can just work as a sub dps that spams basics to generate SP while contributing good ddamage from counters
                        Yeah i think I'd like a sub-dps build for my 2nd team. 

Thanks
                    Lynx is a good healer but if you have Tingyun (which is a permanent slot in Clara teams) then you can easily use any other 5* sustain that you got.

Clara is super resilent to meta and MOC, you won't regret building her at all. This MOC features some of the worst effects (action advance, 2nd side deer does not attack first turn, few Physical weak enemies) and she still cleanly clears quick enough.
            I found her very good in a dual dps team since she does not consume a lot of skill points. Her teams are not that fast but they are comfy.

Team I used was Clara, Lynx, Ruan Mei, Sushang against the physical weak floors. It was really easy. With Ruan Mei buff Sushang can break those elites in one skill, ultimate, skill combo.
                Alright cool! Ty!
Dr Ratio pretty much devalues most dps characters in MoC. He is free and also clears faster than them
    Because of the turbulence buff. Man, they should incorporate the buffs in these infographics, because people tend to forget.
        We are going to have at least two more MoC cycle with floors full of imaginary weakness, so he is most likely going to remain very strong for a while.
            For sure, but you can't really take his current stats and place into a general evaluation considering this buff massively buffed him and his hunt peers (And Jingliu because we are still in her lovechild phase).
Dual-DoT Kafka is actually pretty good it seems even with lightning resistance. I don't even have Sampo, but i'll get swan and start using that team. 

Currently stuck with hypercarry Kafka and i want to use her the intended way.
Can someone explain this numbers? I never understood them
    So, in MoC, you need to clear waves of enemies as fast as possible. This is measured by cycles. The lower the cycles, the faster you cleared it. So basically, the number means how fast each character cleared a stage in MoC. And alongside the average is the standard deviation (the number in parentheses).

One thing to note is that an MoC stage has two phases, and you need to clear those two phases with two separate teams. The number that you see are the average cycles that includes the cycles used by those two teams, not just the phase with the character in it.
Ok, so I know he is really bad and a complete meme, but I expected more yanqing tbh. This moc is by fr his best, and I have seen plenty of people do very well with him, even w/o gepard. The biggest shock is he is used less than himeko, as this moc is by far the worst for euridition characters.

I guess it's more that people use jingling for ice, but my boy definitely deserves more love here :(.
    While he's really good for this MoC, it probably wouldn't justify the cost of building him for a lot of people.

I have used him with Gepard since 1.0 and from my experience he works pretty well but if i had gotten him at around 1.3\~1.4 I probably wouldn't have bothered trying to build him just for Ice weakness even with all the JL floors in MoC.
Sample size is less than the wechat one.
Why do people run dual sustain
    they just want the clear regardlesss of stars at that point
what’s average score in image 6 for LC and relics mean? average cycle count?

Also this crowd is not representative of the average, **slightly** skewed. Pretty sure the % of signature LC and stats is slightly too high.
    Sorry, I forgot to change it to AVG cycle.

It should represent the average player who could clear stage 12, as we only include players who cleared stage 12 in our sample.
So if you don't have a limited 5 star sustain is it better to just play no sustain? 

  
Lynx sometimes shows her face in the stats when paired with Blade/Clara but other sustains, even 5 stars from standard banner are nowhere to be seen.
    Keep in mind I only include the fastest and most used teams in the infographics. Lynx is still often used as a solo sustain, for more teams, check the Prydwen website.
        Ive seen it and its shows that overgeared Jingliu can carry almost anyone.  


All i am saying is 4 star supports in this game are so much better than 4 star sustain that one might consider running a team without one.   


Offence is the best defense. If you need heal it just means you are not killing them fast enough smh  


Thanks for the infographics tho
How does this list work? Bigger the number more used? Or lower the number more used?

        Ooooh thanks a lot.......i just started 1.5 and this is my First time seeing this list. *Me watching Argenti being the Lowest who is Also my Main Dps. I know he is good for Pure Fiction.*
Dr ratio is so good. I can now beat moc 12. I can't even beat moc 10 before
Argenti is missing in the Most Used Character Builds
Finally one that counts Welt as a dps
Me as a new player looking at this stuff without knowing anything

:D

        Thanks, also it's interesting to see what the good teams are cuz my current roster allows me for max Ratio/PhysStelle/Asta/Gepard, lol
battle of PEAK
    Star rail team cooked with the sustainers
To think that they all where called mid before beta
        I hope they cook just as much with Aventurine 🙏
            They sorta have to because of that image. Why would you pull for another sustain unit when, realistically, you only need 2 to clear the endgame content? That's probably their biggest challenge with designing Preservation/Abundance units.

My guess is that he'll lean into adding more damage to the team directly, since one of the LC we got in the new MoC store for Preservation is highly damage focused, which would be useless for all our current Preservation units.
                They should go for niche characters
                    I think so too, like a DoT sustain or a follow up one for example
                    I'm so torn, because on one hand, I think niche characters are cool since they open up new avenues of gameplay.

On the other hand, someone like Ruan Mei has infinitely more use and pull value for an account than, say, Topaz will. One can be slotted into a lot of teams for optimal or slightly sub-optimal builds, the other can only really interact with FU-focused units.
                        Thats great actually, if every character was like ruan mei and didn’t have a niche there would be a big problem in the game
                            I guess my concern would be "how niche?" 

You don't want characters who are so niche that, outside of one or maybe two teams, they're not very good, because then you get an issue w/ new players (or players who have to pick and choose who to pull) where it's like "Well, I want Black Swan, but I don't want Kafka and \[Third Unit for BS\]" or "Well, I want Black Swan, but I cannot afford to pull for Kafka and \[Third Unit for BS\]."
                or they'll just make harder content that basically requires you to run the new support
                    Swarm and GaG in a nutshell.

It's not necessarily necessary to have gotten Daniel/Fu Xuan or Argenti, but I'd be lying if it didn't feel like they made it way easier if you didn't have existing, cracked out units built.
            I think they will 
Ans even id he does end up being underwhelming they'll find a way to indurectly buff him with characters and relics
        When ALL are OP. Then no one is. /s/s, if all are OP they still are OP. So it's good for us player base where we can use anyone we like 👍
            All the limited feel op of properly built
This is good cause you can main your fav without many problems (if your fav is a limited)
    love a good PEAK-off
The turbulence buff played a huge role to his clear times. Getting a free Bronya adv forward every cycle is really broken, and the rest of the hunt carries (including Jingliu because well, it's Jingliu) greatly benefitted from it as well.

Kafka and the rest of the Erudition units have close to realistic clear times in comparison, considering that they don't benefit from turbulence at all. What's surprising is that both Kafka and Jing Yuan have improved their average cycles in MoC12 when both sides have lightning RES.
    Not really surprising, because this Turbulence buff actually affects their gameplay. The debuffs on enemies matter even if they can't get advanced forward.

Last Turbulence, not being able to Break enemies meant essentially having no Turbulence buff.

I think excluding abominations like the second team helped JY’s average score a lot
        What the fuck were they cooking in rank 185
            It’s a substage 1 btw with almost full lightning-wind res. Maybe it comes from misconception that JY is too weak to fight alone and blade is an excellent sub dps for everyone
                Avg. cycles: 19 😩😩😩
            my bad
            I was running that team for quite a while tbh. Blade + bronya + luocha + flex works great with most dps. Rn I run jingliu in that spot. Blade doesn't consume any sp , luocha constantly generates them so you want someone else that uses sp to not overflow. JY was my go to for that before jingliu and it was a very consistent way to clear MoC 12 without much risk.
        Holy fuck. Who added that bullshit into the data…
    Yeah, thanks to the turbulance I used a full hypercarry team on Floor 12 with Ruan Mei and Tingyun, no debuffer. Kafka literally did not make any move, it was the first time ever that it happened to me.
bc they gave buffs to tailored to him hes the strongest for now.
His team with 4 star supports (Pela and Ting) does way better than with 5 stars one like SW+ Topaz lol

If you replace pela with ruan mei is a bit faster but doesnt appear here for some reason, it does appear on their webpage if you look at raio teams, their appeareance rate is pretty similar so not sure why it doesnt show here tho
    That's because the turbulence that forwards 1 hunt/dest character benefits going full hypercarry. In dual dps this turbulence effects a lower damage contribution from the second dps. That team isn't necessarily better than the other in a vacuum, try it without the turbulence.
        On any of the past turbulances SW + Topaz have perform worst than SW + Tingyun , Tingyun + Pela ,etc

So i was right
Average argenti kinda sucks in 2-target scenario, he benefits from bosses who summon mobs frequently because energy issues.
    It especially sucks for lower investment Argentis because if you're not killing stuff fast enough, the more downtime you spend on trying to battery him even with Tingyun + HH.

I am E0S1 with stacked relics and supports so I don't have an issue, but I can definitely see how the energy deficit vs just 1-2 elites can spiral out of control.
Moc 12 has no minions. It's tough to get Argenti's ult up when he's only facing 2 enemies at a time. In a sense, he is a volatile dps in MoC unlike JY who doesn't really care about the number of enemies as long as he can clear ads with skill + ult before LL lands. JY also works as a sub dps for Topaz who is really good against the Ebon Deer whereas Argenti is locked in as a hypercarry.
Yeah the 40% lightning res on both side kinda sucks (which is ironic since Kafka is also on the banner lol)

Then again I still see showcase from different mains able to bruteforce it so I see it as a win game state wise.
Energy supports. I could have pulled HuoHuo, but having 2 limited sustain units already, getting her just for the ER charge is quite a luxury. If only the energy charger was a 5star harmony..

Now Argenti only has TY taking care of his ult which makes him slow vs the other dpses I play.
It should be noted there is a side effect of the way the stats are collected that gives a bias to this conclusion. The cleartime for each DPS is a combination of both sides as opposed to only their side.


If you 1 cycle on 1 side and take 4 on the other, thats a 5 cycle for both DPS, the strong will get dragged down and the weak will be lifted up (in my case JL cleared in 0 and Ratio took 3).


As a result all the DPS start to get pushed together for results that will always look similar.


In the pure fiction stats this wasn't the case and as a result we could see Argenti head and shoulders above the rest.


This isn't to say the data isn't useful or should be ignored, just note that the actual cycle differences can be lot larger than the numbers would imply.
He has energy problems so he needs ideally 5 enemies, one is the boss and the other 4 are very weak.
That's because you only need to do it in 10 cycles. There's no point in doing it faster even if your team can. And once you get the rewards there's no point in doing it again. We'll never really have reliable data to compare characters because of this.
Imo, it's because there is no really good f2p euridition light cone. Destructions and the hunts herta light cones have only light a 5 to 10 percent damage decrease compared to other signature light cones. There is no f2p euridition light cone on that level.

Maybe it's just me, but that is how I fell whenever I use a f2p lightcone on himeko, qq, or argenti.
    >Destructions and the hunts herta light cones have only light a 5 to 10 percent damage decrease compared to other signature light cones.

No they're not. It depends on the character. Here is the damage difference referenced by Prydwen:

Jingliu - 15% from S5 Aeon

Blade - 32% from S1 Secret Vow

DHIL - 13% from S5 Aeon

Ratio - 12% from S5 Cruising

And here's the damage difference for limited Erudition units. I included the BP light cone for low spenders (it's the only good BP light cone):

Argenti - 15% from S5 Breakfast, 4% from S5 Peaceful Day

Jing Yuan - 17% from S5 Breakfast, 7% from S5 Peaceful Day

As you can see, Blade has the worst light cone selections, as his "F2P" option is a gacha light cone.
        Fair enough.
Argenti is a PF god but exceedingly mid at MoC which is filled with two elite scenarios.
Thanks for your work
Highly appreciate it! 
Thanks for adding the histograms w/ averages for each floor!
I'm rather surprised to see Clara doing so well. I only played during launch and had a lot of fun with the counter/follow-up attack playstyle.

    "laughably easy"? Its possible but it by no means easy...
        [deleted]
            So never spent on refresh is your benchmark for "laughably easy"? okay then...

Cause for me, if someone say it's easy I figure it as 1 week of farming relic.
    "Yada yada, yall are pathetic. What's so hard getting these stats? Just lucksack it."

Ya jackass, you're talking like the gear substats are guaranteed to drop, and rolls go to the correct stats you're looking for. Shut the fuck up. Im already lucky if i can fully gear a character in 3 weeks without fuel refills.
    >idk how long you have been playing

Since day one

>just grind the domains

I do. Crits are so rare. I get only CR or CD at best and then everything goes into another substat.

>there are people with like 75/200+ ratios

Whales ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
        i doubt the majority of even whales are spending money to grind out relics like that. it just takes time - it took me 5 weeks to get a decent ratio set (70-200) and even longer to get an argenti set. you just need to commit to farming for one unit instead of spreading yourself too thin
            This is exactly the point I was trying to make, it’s really not hard to get artifacts it’s just not instant
        Look, i think you’ve been farming other things, which is completely optimal for guaranteed upgrades. But how could you not have been stuck on the quantum domain for at least four months. Or really insert any domain. If its because of the characters you have guess thats understandable for whatever enjoyment you want.

Getting 64/180, 80/160 is really just the most serviceable amt of ratios you need.

I played star rail first couple ptches, stopped couple months and came back. Given I only hyperinvest two teams, I have two dpses with a solid 90/200 and 60/200. Didnt spend a penny on jacksht
            I farmed quantum first two months of the game. The best I got is 53.4/144.1. And since release of 1.5 I farm FUP/DoT domain. My Topaz has wild 57.4/120.6.

Like look at Seele. With her traces she has 5/74 at base. We are trying to get 75/200. With crit rate body and 8% from planar set we still need 29.6 CR just from substats. For CD even if you have 5\* LC with 30 CD you still need 78.6% from substats to achieve 200.

Getting 29.6 CR and 78.6 CD from substats AT THE SAME TIME is insanely lucky.
                He must be talking about Jingliu. Except of her, a 80/160 ratio is not easy to achieve. Possible, especially with outside buffs, but definitely not "everyone has it". Unless of course you play rainbow set, but that is only a good trade if their set is shit to begin with.


Of all my chars, only Ratio achieves this without their signature LC. 
                    No my highest rated one is seele, next is Imbibitor. The hardest sht i find hard to farm was a helm piece somehow.
                Now its entirely possible you dont get sht for a year for a set, but the likelihood from you just spamming raimbow sets should net you at least close to 70/160. Idk maybe a select few of you out there are really unlucky but odds are you’ll get these stats eventually. Pickup smth else and have fun. Or go do whatever. 

These relic stats will be just a dent on your probable lifetime in this game.
            These stats are luck dependent. You could be like me where I had many many potential godly roll pieces, but they always roll flat stats. I have maxed out my relic inventory several times and crafted many relics. I could not get stats like that on any combination of my relics. Even so I still cleared everything in this game so even with trash stats and 4 star lightcones you can beat everything.

Not sure what a lot of relic farming is but I did some 700 or so relic calyx runs.
    Pls link your account I'd like to look it up. 75/200 is hardly possible without grinding for months + whaling for theirsignature  Edit:

As I thought. Dude is a whale haha.

    How the fuck it's not much? 140 is not much and even this is difficult to achieve
        [deleted]
            >If you get 10% cd per other pieces

Yeah, easy. Especially easy because I also need CR at the same time
I'm still worried about how he will perform after this cycle ends ngl. My only reliable debuffers are Pela and Welt and using only one still didn't do well for me and using both means I either have to ditch sustain or ditch harmony which will sink his dmg even further. What are the current best budget options he has right now?
    Best budget options are E1 Guinaifen (with the Luka LC) and E4 Pela (with Luka LC). They can both guarantee his follow-up attack within a single team slot, which is the main requirement for Ratio to succeed.
    With Pela and TY he's pretty good, you can try him in previous moc 12
    Welt sustain is always an option (especially if you have RM). The enemy hardly ever had a turn when I used him that way on floor 12
Yeah I was worried he'd get nerfs for being free but glad he's getting the full premium treatment with a full powered kit and a catered MoC
i started the game week ago and did consider going for dhil but since i have welt and ratio i can skip him without regretting right ?
    Yeah you won’t need him at all since you have Welt and Ratio. It will be a lot better for you to save for either a DPS of a different element or a good support.
        my goal for now is getting sparkle since i use qinque a lot and i heard she will be like bronya which im desperate for. and i have no idea when i will lose my 50 50 to her. other units im aiming to get are jingliu and fu xuan i hope they are good characters to aim for. (i would like luocha too but i dont think i will have enough jades for him)
            Those are all going to be really good characters, sounds like you have a great plan!
                thanks i try to avoid making mistakes for first couple months at least
            Sparkle is good in general though i wouldn’t recommend using qinque until she’s atleast e4 (ideally e6) shes pretty meh before then, i recommend getting aventurine cuz he’s preservation limited so an automatic pull and another good dps could be really any other future character but Aventurine for sustain and sparkle for support can never go wrong
                ill get her to e4 on sparkle banner hopium    tbh im not interested in aventurine even if he turns out great cuz i need to collect some waifus first hehe maybe on his rerun
                    Have you seen the new music video? Bro is cool but if you dont want to  then you’ll have to wait for either fu xuan or huo huo for sustain
            >i would like luocha too but i dont think i will have enough jades for him

Don't worry, his rerun will be in version 3.4 at the very least.

(Yes, I'm salty his rerun got postponed)
    For gameplay yes, but it's never a waste to roll for a character if you like them.
        hes really fun i would like to get him but its quite expensive to get every character i want :(
    I'd say yeah.

You got enough Imaginary coverage. So getting a DPS for an element you're missing or maybe getting a strong Harmony support would be more beneficial than Dhil.
    Never listen to people that claim dhil stronger than Ratio thingy, only go for dhil if you like Dan Heng, of course.
    Dan il is worth  if you plan to get his E2, at that point has more damage than ratiop in single target and a fuck ton more as soon as theres 2 or more enemys present

Ratio is good but it  struggles hard as soon as theres more than 2 enemys on the field , so he is lock to MoC pretty much , Dan il can be play on any game mode witouth issues

  
BUT... you probably better covering other roles if you new, mainly strong supports, like sparkle soon enough
Huo Huo too, battery is really good for Ratio make him able to spam more wiseman's folly talent, fua fua and more fua, everyone got's the chalk


aand that's why it got the fastest clear
    Yeah, honestly at this point i think alot of people are realizing how good she is and as long as sp isn’t an issue shes better than luocha in every way
        Well yeah, if you take away luocha's main strength(super sp positive) he becomes worse than HH. That's exactly why they are different and they both have their uses
        Its also why HuoHuo with DHiL is very feast or famine. Either you just utterly crush the enemy with ults or you eventually blow out your sp economy. But man when you get DHIL Tingyun and HuoHuo in a team with someone like Yukong and everyone is speed tuned to make things happen… the damage is gross.
Ratio + pela and ting is way stronger than his Topaz teams as shown on this data, so not worth to waste so many jades to get a worst team tbh
No fr. I don’t have her, I only have Pela and March. March technically is a support unit but her attack is equal to Pela for me?! I low key neglect my MoC because of it. IL, TB, and Sampo are my big damage dealers, but the latest update has me speed running Pela into a sleeper agent
>!2.0 moc don't have alot of ice weak enemies!<
Secure to kill minions is important in her cycle, using ult with her in some cases is like an extra turn too.
She's just that good. Equip her with DDD ult early and suddenly even your slowest dps can act 2 times in the first cycle
For low investment.
I'm an avid Perfect Timing user and it's just due to the effect res stat where even Kafka has a hard time dominating him. Auto heal comes in clutch most of the time.
    I can understand this mindset. If you have enough speed subs lying around or when loucha’s speed and sp gen dont matter cause you have enough sp, just go comfy haha dominate what btch
        Luocha*
Thanks for the reminder that i should build that lc for him one of these days.


Though in my case, i just wanted him to be tankier so he has bailu's sig lc. (i dont have bailu, i also... Have welts too now and no welt lol) 
I had Multiplication on him for a time but switched it off him because his defense was too low with it. I went from him never dying to consistently getting one shot in the upper MoCs and simulated universe with Multiplication.

Figured there was no point in Luocha action advancing if he was dead so switched him to Perfect Timing and never looked back
It is but honestly I play mine with Jingliu and Blade so they don't need the heavy sp generation

I recently got perfect timing I can finally say no to Kafka dominate it's quite funny
What’s multiplication?
    A 3-star Abundance Cone, at S5 the wearer gets Advanced Forward by 20% everytime they use their Basic Attack
Nah, it depends on your play style. If you don't have hardcore HP/DEF stats on Luocha, he becomes too weak with Multiplication. Also, an effect res build with Perfect Timing is excellent against high-CC bosses. And Bailu's sig works great if you want him tankier.
Because he becomes hell squishy with it. Very low base stats
My Luocha is already fast enough and i don't like base stats of 3* LC. Perfect Timing is what i like.
Makes me wonder if they're gonna release enemies that are straight up immune to Lightning like the stupid thunderbirb in Genshin.
    I doubt they will.
Seele - always lose in excel calculations but win the actual fight
    Consistency is Seele's second name, rules are meant to be broken as always
    i mean they straight up calc her dmg without accounting for her resurgence at all lmao
    Excel calculations ≠ Actual gameplay

Folks need to realize this as there's many factors that an ally can ult earlier than the simulated numbers
        It’s even worse for Seele’s case because resurgence gives her extra turn and basic attack advances her forward (which you use quite often when you play Seele) so there’s no way to reliably calculate the overall damage she’s getting from all the turn manipulation without making several assumptions.
Seele, silverwolf is going to be the best option if you don't have the element until the next 5* quantum damage dealer.
    I can't hear you over the qingqillion sound of qingqillion damage
        Did she ever outclass Seele in average cycles?
            no lol, as much as people love qq she is not better than seele (and QQ feels bad to play, Sparkle may fix this)
                Sparkle can give her skill pts but can't fix her randomness. And her problem is not even skill pts.
            Nope. Even though her appearance rate is significantly lower which gives her an advantage.
                There was a MoC, probably during DHIL release where the blessing was amazing for QQ, which makes sense since she works nearly the same as DHIL.

I switch them around depending how I feel anyway since both work, QQ gameplay is still the most fun in the game imo tho.

Fuck it we draw
                    You are probably talking about one of QQ’s teams performing better than a Seele team during that MOC cycle because QQ has never been above Seele in the average MOC cycle chart.
        The QQ sect exists only in reddit, Seele remains as queen 👑
        This ain't simulated universe
But people told me Seele was going to get powercrept months ago! It's always her turn in everything except falling out of the meta!
    Even in 1.0 Jing Yuan wanters keep saying Seele users are gonna regret pulling when Jing Yuan power crept her.
        I regret not pulling JY because his kit is cool as hell
And the constant Quantum team posts where it's always QQ in the past few days/weeks.
    She needs her blessings of propagation
        People love to shit on Seele for some reason, especially the QQ sect.
            They're mad they don't have her
                Me having both, enjoying QQ gamba for SU and Seele if MoC gets too serious, though in the end both work.

Can't wait for sparkle for true monoquantum tho
            I see that same sentiment from Seele mains towards QQ. Which is fine, but doesn't make Seele mains stand out as better than those.
                The Seele main call deluded QQ sect on their bullshit and lie their spread to shit on Seele, they don't shit on other character.

Can end up a little heated sometime but not a surprise a lot of people are fed up with QQ sect bullshit because they can't accept that E6 QQ can't compete with Seele in any category and with any limited 5\* dps.
                    I mean I would agree with you that bashing of a character feels wrong. I wouldn't want Seele to be bashed without reason and knowledge as well, but saying QQ E6 is worse than any limited 5\* dps is so wrong.

If we are talking about PF I completely agree. If we are talking about MoC, then no. You are basing that on? Let me know.
                        The only limited DPS that is worse than her in MoC is Argenti due to his mechanics (hates 1-2 targets w/o summons)
                Ehh we're more busy calling each other or Seele frauds, suffering from shitty relic gacha and shipping seele with Bronya to care about QQ
                    Well, I've looked at the recent QQ post on the front page of this sub. That may altered my impression. 
                        are you sure, those post either exclude Seele's existence as a mono quantum character or present QQ as a top tier character even though she is the incarnation of gacha itself and not always reliable.
                            Nobody cares if she is always reliable or not. People like playing her because of the gamble part. But even then, her average is pretty reliable already. People are shitting on the character without much thought and rehash the same problems people said before people caught on that she actually is very good. Of course not Jingliu/DHIL good, nobody should debate that.

Also I don't understand how that post should include Seeles existence if it is specifically how QQ got buffs nearly every patch. Seele mains just come in and say "actually Sparkle is a big buff for Seele as well" which nobody debated. But somehow there is a need to go in shit on the character, praise Seele and then leave? There are good quantum options even without Seele and not every quantum post must involve her. Granted, I find the people who are commenting under every Seele thing a QQ copypasta or similar thing irritating as well.

If I look into most post histories of people commenting hate to QQ, I see them posting on Seele mains a lot or have some other connection to her, than it is so obvious what is happening. That's literally my point I made and that still stands as strong as ever.
                                Not the amount of money posts of quantum girls that happen to exclude seele? Which are obviously passive aggressive attacks on her considering that everyone is quantum, you're just attention seekers that are mad at something, don't really care what is it about
    Dont worry. Everyone is going to realize that Seele is better with Sparkle anyway. Let them cope. (Note this does not apply to Propagation spam QQ in SU. Shes stupid in that mode. This is coming from a quantum dps main who literally has a built Seele, QQ, and Xueyi  just because I like them. Lol)
Welcome to the immortal 1.0 powercreep roach. Naysayers cant kill her.
Yes but as you can see it needs FX apparently, so it a yes, but for premium mono Quantum 


Dual carry quantum with FX/SW, viable 


Dual sustain quantum, viable 


But so far no Lynx only sustain, no SW/Seele/Lynx/flex nor SW/Selee/Lynx/Xueyi or QQ


Hanabi come out soon, So yeah she won't go anywhere, extra premium mono quantum comp gonna be real good. 


Hope Lynx can replace or temp subs FX hmm
    I can solo sustain with Lynx, but it lose a lot of damage
    All three premium sustains are sitting on the utilization table. This isnt a lynx issue. Its people not really using any of the other 4 star sustains in general except for niche uses like Lynx blade
Brake effect Luka is honestly insane
    In the new event Despair mode he can kill an entire bar of Bronya/Gepard before they recover from break. It's hilarious.
    Break effect Luka? Sound interesting. I should build him. I'm guessing it's just about stacking attack and break effect?
        Yep, you should definetly try it, even a mid-investment build is impressive
        Yes, just stack as much BE as possible and time his attacks to break physical weak enemies. Bleed with lots of BE stacked is very strong, so he does work that way as a sub-DPS.
    Yeah. And Ruan Mei buffed him a lot. I've seen a video of him 0-cycling the Deer (current floor 12). Tried to recreate it myself, and it was one of the easiest 0-cycles I've ever had. His 200k-300k break hits are no joke.
        Does he need constellations ?
            His e6 helps if you are aiming for 0-cycling. But he can work even at e0.
        what is the build? i have him c6 but never used bc i dont care for dot teams and figured he was dot related?
            You basicly just stack break effect. As much as you can. His relics sets and planar sets don't really matter: Musketeer, Prisoner, Thief, 2+2 combo, Talia, SSS, Glamoth - anything works. All you need is to plan your actions - to ensure he is the one who lands break hits.

My Luka has 2.7k atk, 192% BE, 139 spd. 4pc Musketeer and 2pc Glamoth, LC - s5 Fermata. Not optimal, but works anyway.
                What team works with him?
                    His current best teammates are:

1. Ruan Mei (break efficiency) - it takes less hits to break enemies.
2. SW - deals a lot of toughness damage, applies physical weakness, shreds defence.
                [deleted]
                    Leveling up his talent definitely wouldn't hurt. Also, his a6 trace synergies very well with his e6 (if you have it) - for extra bleed dmg triggering.
                        [deleted]
                            His enhanced basic attack makes all bleed effects deal damage immediately; break bleed included. Leveling his talent will increase the triggering damage.
As explained on top of the slide, only teams used at least 5 times on each of the stages 10 - 12 are included in the list.
    ah didnt see the "each stage"! good work on the data love to see it
More like the buffs straight up counter him. He gets forwarded with no SP left and has to BA and waste his turn
So you saying cycle doesn't favor him, but a lots of folk calling his E2 op for some reason which are pretty much does the same thing as this turbulence.
    The turbulence forwards him when you have no SP left. Not much to do in that situation.

His E2 forwards him and gives him a free fully enhanced basic attack. Huge difference.
    You're ignoring the fact IL's Ult provides 3 Squama Stacks which are basically 3 SPs while the Turbulence pulls him up with no extra SPs to work with


I did comfortably clear the second half using 3 cycles with IL but I had to use normal Basic Attack multiple times which only really made me waste Tingyun buff turns
        It is just a 100% forward with 1 more addtional sp, meanwhile Ratio E2 is free massive damage, no turn spending required, so buff is retained and not using sp.
            Lol "just" 💀
                Well you see what that "just" did for him in this MoC
                    Missed the part about the e2 giving him a free 3BA?

You cannot read
    LOL tell me you dont know what E2 dan doesn witouth telling me 

His E2 push him forward but also give him 3 skill point to use, thats the big differencem this turbulence advanc him forward and your are stuck doing a normal auatoatack , pretty useless
    His E2 gives him the three SP he needs to instantly attk. This is very different from having your attk timing completely botched by getting forwarded before your team can generate SP.
    His E2 gives him SP after the ult, the MOC turbulence doesn't.
    Learn what his E2 actually does before blabbering out of your ass. It literally directly counters him with this current turbulent blessings
    Sorry i didn't make my question clear, why is E2 Dan consider op and not a single person calling Ratio E2 op yet?
Sorry, I mistakenly counted PF as 2
People farm relics for many months to reach those numbers. LCs help too but it's completely realistic to reach those numbers for day one players who've been dumping their stamina every day and not trashing pieces with potential (if you have ten pieces with one line of crit, one of them will probably be good)
probably people using jing yuan or argenti sig LCs that give 36 cdmg and 8 crit from rutilant arena

that gives you 13/86 at which point all you need is a crit chest and double crit pieces on all gear 

people have had since launch to work on QQ so there's going to be a lot of people that just spent a lot of time relic farming for her
    Fair enough, though i played every single day since i joined the game and bought every single bp, i only joined during Fu banner, was mid Sep i think. I farmed quite a bit the quant for both QQ and Jing together, but prolly not enough compared to day 1 players when it comes to quant set fatm
        My biggest regret in this game was not getting Jing Yuan light cone. It has been painful farming for relics to get the appropriate amount of crit when his light cone would instantly fix all my problems. It is like a cheat code that saves you 4 months of farming or more.
"We heard you." - HoYo

\*Casually puts lightning res enemies on both sides.
    Nah they wouldn't do that to Acheron, she's the Raiden expy after all !
        "Fine, we'll have 1 patch with Lightning weakness. After that we're going back to form" - HoYo
Need downfall for both ice and imaginary dps and let other elements shines in some moc
Imagine Cocolias on both sides. Jingliu users had their fun for 3 patches in a row. Time to fuck them over just like how they did with lightning lmao
    [deleted]
        The deer should've been a cocolia side, Kafka is literally right there on banner atm. The deer is the most random choice ever...
            Idk why they keep pestering us with that dumb plant. Always found the deer annoying

Same the entire thing is flooded with ice weakness. Make cocolia on one side and the fat dude and chainsaw man ice res dudes on the other side.
Even against Ice RES enemies, Jingliu's capacity to brute force is quite high. 


Even more if you own Ruan Mei. 
    Also helps that one of the best f2p friendly debuffers in the game (pela) is able to ice res down AND synergizes explosively with the quantum set.
Cocolia and Yanqing both sides

On the floor before that is Gepard and lets hope Sam will also resist to ice

Problem is she still probably has fairly high usage since until foreseable future she is the only premium ice DPS. By the time Acheron released there are 3 already for ligthning. Both DHIL and Blade also has Ratio and Black Swan already as premium new dps for their elements
    [deleted]
        Not really, you could just spam SP to attack just to remove that mechanic
jingliu mains are laughing they already abused it for many months. plus she needs only e0.
    She dont need that shit either. Woman gets more than a free crit rate body worth of crit rate for practically free and a truck load of attk. Her damage floor is disgusting.
Keep crying
    Well too bad, Jingliu havers are gonna be the ones crying. Because out of the 10 new Penacony mobs, only 3 of them are weak to ice.

Not to mention that neither of the 2 new bosses are weak to ice (but they both have lightning weakness lol)
        They have quantum weakness so she does get 20% Def shred
            So does every other dps with the quantum set. Not matching the element also mean you can break the ennemy shield effectively. Not to mention the 20% ice resistance they have.
                The Res is cancelled because of the set. It's a no weakness no Res enemy for JL,the other dps do have quantum set but they have better relic sets. JL has the worst relic options in the game
        I mean, having ice weak enemies only meant breeze clears for Jingliu. I personally want more challenge and have SW anyways :\

It was just weird to me to wish for a character to drop down
            >It was just weird to me to wish for a character to drop down

I personally understand the feeling, if the meta is always the same for a long time it starts to get boring, having variety is good !
                Agree :)
You also just have to realize that jingliu’s damage floor being so high hard carries people who are f2p and dolphins with low eidolons (this impacts the data in her favor). With the free Attk% and 50% crit rate she can literally get to endgame with some of the most mid relics ever.
Not only that you can always just switch out Silverwolf for another buffer like Ruan Mei or Tingyun whenever the enemy is on Quantum
I know right. Its not like the 1.0 dps still sits near the top irregardless of element coverage /s
she gives dmg bonus on FUA and her dumb goes forward with ratio's FUA so yes it's free dmg and single target, which is what ratio does
she does decent damage even without fire weakness, great sub dps
Yes
Sub DPS support kinda like some builds of SW
Not really, you better off with Pela, Ting and ruan mei any combination of those are stronger than topaz on any of those spots, if you lack those 3 then yeha she works but is far from the best option
    Nah, Topaz is better than Pela starting at S1, she has a 50% FUA damage increase and 24%crit damage AND personal good damage versus 40%def shred for Pela. The only reason you would use Pela is if you really need an SP generator. Heck, SW is a better option if you just need a debuffer.

If you look at the CN chart, the TY, Topaz, Ratio, Huohuo team is the 3rd highest after no sustain JL and DHIL.
        Like i say now with a lot more data Topaz is worst than most combination of Pela, ting and ruan mei consistently, it has being the case on every MoC so far ... so seems i was right
        CN data takes into account all eidolons so any team with multiple 5 stars is gonna be on top as they can have a lot of team with all E6 skewing the data , Tthe data we have here is a lot more representative of normal f2p - low spender players

So for normal people Ting + pela is stronger tna Topaz + SW as shown here , you need eidolons and/or signature lighctones for the other comp to be stronger , pela + ting is literally plug and play witouth using a single pull

  
Like i have E2 S1 Dan IL , for a E2 S1 he is probably the strongest dps, would i call him the strongets dps when talking in a reddit thread about MoC statistics that are meant for F2P ? not at all , same thing for thos ecomps, if they need multiple 5 stars and signature lightcones to be a bit better than characters you get for free then their pull value is pretty low
She's good but not best in slot until maybe E1S1. Tingyun, Huohuo, and either Pela or RM are likely his best teammates for most people.
> Also Blade hypercarry clearing faster than Seele hypercarry? 

Look at usage rate. I suspect those who use Blade in wind-res environment are more skilled/invested than who use Seele hypercarry (4x times more usage percent)
    Yeah this is perhaps it. Blade is my favourite character and I love to see him doing well but I'm under no delusion that he performs better than Seele.
        Well this data is 10-12 floor combined he’s excellent on floor 11, so it’s may be it as well
            This is what annoys me about their data. Just focus on floor 12.
                And 3* clears
The action forward turbulence benefits hypercarry. Topaz teams have less Ratio damage but similar or higher team damage, meaning the turbulence works against this kind of team.
I honestly want explanation on this as well since I tried my Ratio with Topaz and SW and also with Tingyun and Pela, and he dealt more damage with the 4 stars plus he gets his ult faster
    Tingyun gives massive a buffs and energy so that’s already something
I think MoC has the thing where it puts like 8 debuffs on the enemy? SW becomes over redundant at that point. You need more buffers then anything to get massive damage. HuoHuo is also there and she gives energy and huge atk buff on ult plus refunds Tingyun a bit. Pela honestly feels the most replaceable in the team, you could swap her out for Topaz and get about the same result if said enemy was weak to fire anyway.

All that energy gives Ratio more ults and more follow ups which means more damage versus more debuffs that diminish due to the MoC turbulence.

Edit: Also another thing to think about is supports are built to be quick. They’ll atk multiple times to generate sp, with the right amount of debuffs the follow up becomes basically guaranteed which means fast = more damage

This is my assumption anyway
        I tested both teams not on the current MoC, but the last reset before it so there is no debuff turbulence but yeah more energy really is amazing on Ratio
            If it was done on the last MoC then it's most likely the energy gain just outweighs the benefits of Debuffs which feels crazy to say. Just more Tingyun/HuoHuo Stonks I suppose
The blessing helps Blade a ton. The extra turn allows you to sync your biggest hits with Bronya's buff/ult fairly easily. Seele gets very little benefit from an unbuffed extra turn where she likely can't one shot.

SW has always been worse than Pela for fast clears - she won't be able to keep up with Ratio if he's killing targets fast enough. Topaz also just doesn't provide enough compared to Tingyun until maybe E1S1, Ratio benefits a lot from energy.
Pela can do her job without using SP, SW can't

Ratio getting extra turns every cycle + TY refreshing her buff more often because of said extra turns means Pela's SP positivity is more beneficial

similar issue with seele, the turbulence gives her too many turns so most of her attacks end up being unbuffed or out of sync with the other supports

also these later fights are dual elite fights with 0 adds for extra resurgence options, seele is the only hunt that doesn't prefer pure ST fights
    I don't think SP is the main reason that team is performing better. Ratio is of course SP- , TY is SP+, SW is SP neutral and HH can be played SP+. Even if TY's buff runs out quicker and she drops down to being SP neutral, the team, theoretically, should not be facing any SP issues.
    I also think Pela's better ult uptime plus aoe shred lets her keep up with ratio better bcs he kills a single target so quick that SW struggles to keep up her ult def shred up against duo elites.

I think it's fairly ridiculous that my pela with only an energy regen rope alongside luka LC using technique plus skill can get her ultimate on her first turn, while my SW with tutorial and energy regen plus 5% from penacony set doing the same thing can't (pela becoming sp positive completely afterward doesnt help). I wish they'd change it so she can tbh, her energy cost is prob the most painful part about her bcs it forces me to save her ult meanwhile I don't hesitate to use pela's ult when i have it up.
[deleted]
    Wait, people think Luocha is worse than Fu Xuan or HuoHuo?

I don’t own any of them, but each of them has their own separate utilities lol.

Luocha can basically AFK heal. FuXuan makes your team almost unkillable. HuoHuo makes a majority of debuffs worthless.

I don’t think its fair to compare them, but hey. JY gets shit on for a bunch of reasons so I am not surprised Luocha also gets shit on too.
        >I don’t think its fair to compare them

But it is. They fight for the same spot. If I have to build two teams and need one sustain per team, I have to make a choice between them.

Luocha heals a lot and is SP positive but FX and HH have other gimmicks that make them overall more valuable (HH has ATK buff and energy regeneration - and becomes SP neutral at E1, FX has crit rate and damage split).
        Well he not cute.
        The advantages FX and Huohuo have are their crit rate and Atk/energy buffs. Luocha has SP positivity but that's rarely if ever needed if you're clearing quickly. Running a cloud set (which Huohuo's best in slot regardless) gives you some extra leeway too.

Luocha's definitely better than Huohuo for sustaining your team but is overkill once your team has enough investment.
        Ok, here's a serious answer, he have no future. his Eidolon are too crappy compare to Fu Xuan or Huohuo.
Standard deviation, per what it says in the first image
Even with bronya is extremely disruptive. One of the few times I switched off dhil specifically because of how obnoxious it was
Nerf? Since when was a guaranteed extra turn a nerf regardless of speed?.

Don't actually try to 3BA every turn. It screws rotations yes but play around it not force the typical strats always
    You said it yourself. It screws with rotations and buff uptime.
No, it doesn't
yk being one of the most used is enough to tell us that people are running eidolons lol. I have seen a single guy play yk without E6 and she was mostly a 2nd dps, not even a support at that point.
    I mean I did say 5 star eidolons... I asked because i believe the cycles only take e0 5stars into account so was wondering if the same is for appearance rate. I know 4 stars with eidolons arent excluded coz thats just doesn't makes sense.
[deleted]
    thats my go-to team though 🥲
Blade and Jingliu are a great combo, add in a support like pela or Ruan mei and a sustain, I don't know about DHIL though
    i don't have RM. tho i do have bronya. idk if she's a good match for  jingliu
        She is! Bronya is good with everyone really
            oh thanks. time to build my bronya now
[deleted]
    so they use the same team on both sides and add their total cycle used?
Its for both side , >10 would be not a 3 star clear
    so the last picture, the one of dan heng who used a median of 7.5 cycles. Means the average dan heng player player used 3.75 cycles 1st and 2nd side?
        Kinda yes , its a bit skewed since its only 18 submissions tho ; so not really the average Dan heng i'd say
            thank you for taking the time to answer. I always thought it was weird and assumed it was just subside 1 or 2. wish they could average for each side.
                Unfortunately it's not possible with the data that we have, which comes from Hoyolab. Until Hoyolab updates their data (very unlikely), we'll keep showing this kind of data.
she's match up dependent but she's really good on bosses that attack twice and fast like kafka
    So should i bother building her? Or wait to pull for a better dps? I'm thinking Dan Heng.
        if you want a strong physical dps and tolerate her counter based gameplay then yes

the only other competition she has in that role is argenti and sushang but you also don't *need* a physical dps
            I found pairing her with Lynx is pretty good, since Lynx makes enemies focus her so she procs her attacks way more often specially with ult. 

But yeah idk if i want to heavily invest into a physical dps. Maybe pair her WITH Dan Heng so she tanks some damage from him? Build her tank-ish? But would that mess with his "optimal" team? Whatever that is...
                she doesn't need any tank stats you just always build like a normal crit dps

you can pair her with other dps too yeah, she can just work as a sub dps that spams basics to generate SP while contributing good ddamage from counters
                    Yeah i think I'd like a sub-dps build for my 2nd team. 

Thanks
                Lynx is a good healer but if you have Tingyun (which is a permanent slot in Clara teams) then you can easily use any other 5* sustain that you got.

Clara is super resilent to meta and MOC, you won't regret building her at all. This MOC features some of the worst effects (action advance, 2nd side deer does not attack first turn, few Physical weak enemies) and she still cleanly clears quick enough.
        I found her very good in a dual dps team since she does not consume a lot of skill points. Her teams are not that fast but they are comfy.

Team I used was Clara, Lynx, Ruan Mei, Sushang against the physical weak floors. It was really easy. With Ruan Mei buff Sushang can break those elites in one skill, ultimate, skill combo.
            Alright cool! Ty!
Because of the turbulence buff. Man, they should incorporate the buffs in these infographics, because people tend to forget.
    We are going to have at least two more MoC cycle with floors full of imaginary weakness, so he is most likely going to remain very strong for a while.
        For sure, but you can't really take his current stats and place into a general evaluation considering this buff massively buffed him and his hunt peers (And Jingliu because we are still in her lovechild phase).
So, in MoC, you need to clear waves of enemies as fast as possible. This is measured by cycles. The lower the cycles, the faster you cleared it. So basically, the number means how fast each character cleared a stage in MoC. And alongside the average is the standard deviation (the number in parentheses).

One thing to note is that an MoC stage has two phases, and you need to clear those two phases with two separate teams. The number that you see are the average cycles that includes the cycles used by those two teams, not just the phase with the character in it.
While he's really good for this MoC, it probably wouldn't justify the cost of building him for a lot of people.

I have used him with Gepard since 1.0 and from my experience he works pretty well but if i had gotten him at around 1.3\~1.4 I probably wouldn't have bothered trying to build him just for Ice weakness even with all the JL floors in MoC.
they just want the clear regardlesss of stars at that point
Sorry, I forgot to change it to AVG cycle.

It should represent the average player who could clear stage 12, as we only include players who cleared stage 12 in our sample.
Keep in mind I only include the fastest and most used teams in the infographics. Lynx is still often used as a solo sustain, for more teams, check the Prydwen website.
    Ive seen it and its shows that overgeared Jingliu can carry almost anyone.  


All i am saying is 4 star supports in this game are so much better than 4 star sustain that one might consider running a team without one.   


Offence is the best defense. If you need heal it just means you are not killing them fast enough smh  


Thanks for the infographics tho

    Ooooh thanks a lot.......i just started 1.5 and this is my First time seeing this list. *Me watching Argenti being the Lowest who is Also my Main Dps. I know he is good for Pure Fiction.*

    Thanks, also it's interesting to see what the good teams are cuz my current roster allows me for max Ratio/PhysStelle/Asta/Gepard, lol
Star rail team cooked with the sustainers
To think that they all where called mid before beta
    I hope they cook just as much with Aventurine 🙏
        They sorta have to because of that image. Why would you pull for another sustain unit when, realistically, you only need 2 to clear the endgame content? That's probably their biggest challenge with designing Preservation/Abundance units.

My guess is that he'll lean into adding more damage to the team directly, since one of the LC we got in the new MoC store for Preservation is highly damage focused, which would be useless for all our current Preservation units.
            They should go for niche characters
                I think so too, like a DoT sustain or a follow up one for example
                I'm so torn, because on one hand, I think niche characters are cool since they open up new avenues of gameplay.

On the other hand, someone like Ruan Mei has infinitely more use and pull value for an account than, say, Topaz will. One can be slotted into a lot of teams for optimal or slightly sub-optimal builds, the other can only really interact with FU-focused units.
                    Thats great actually, if every character was like ruan mei and didn’t have a niche there would be a big problem in the game
                        I guess my concern would be "how niche?" 

You don't want characters who are so niche that, outside of one or maybe two teams, they're not very good, because then you get an issue w/ new players (or players who have to pick and choose who to pull) where it's like "Well, I want Black Swan, but I don't want Kafka and \[Third Unit for BS\]" or "Well, I want Black Swan, but I cannot afford to pull for Kafka and \[Third Unit for BS\]."
            or they'll just make harder content that basically requires you to run the new support
                Swarm and GaG in a nutshell.

It's not necessarily necessary to have gotten Daniel/Fu Xuan or Argenti, but I'd be lying if it didn't feel like they made it way easier if you didn't have existing, cracked out units built.
        I think they will 
Ans even id he does end up being underwhelming they'll find a way to indurectly buff him with characters and relics
    When ALL are OP. Then no one is. /s/s, if all are OP they still are OP. So it's good for us player base where we can use anyone we like 👍
        All the limited feel op of properly built
This is good cause you can main your fav without many problems (if your fav is a limited)
love a good PEAK-off
Not really surprising, because this Turbulence buff actually affects their gameplay. The debuffs on enemies matter even if they can't get advanced forward.

Last Turbulence, not being able to Break enemies meant essentially having no Turbulence buff.

I think excluding abominations like the second team helped JY’s average score a lot
    What the fuck were they cooking in rank 185
        It’s a substage 1 btw with almost full lightning-wind res. Maybe it comes from misconception that JY is too weak to fight alone and blade is an excellent sub dps for everyone
            Avg. cycles: 19 😩😩😩
        my bad
        I was running that team for quite a while tbh. Blade + bronya + luocha + flex works great with most dps. Rn I run jingliu in that spot. Blade doesn't consume any sp , luocha constantly generates them so you want someone else that uses sp to not overflow. JY was my go to for that before jingliu and it was a very consistent way to clear MoC 12 without much risk.
    Holy fuck. Who added that bullshit into the data…
Yeah, thanks to the turbulance I used a full hypercarry team on Floor 12 with Ruan Mei and Tingyun, no debuffer. Kafka literally did not make any move, it was the first time ever that it happened to me.
That's because the turbulence that forwards 1 hunt/dest character benefits going full hypercarry. In dual dps this turbulence effects a lower damage contribution from the second dps. That team isn't necessarily better than the other in a vacuum, try it without the turbulence.
    On any of the past turbulances SW + Topaz have perform worst than SW + Tingyun , Tingyun + Pela ,etc

So i was right
It especially sucks for lower investment Argentis because if you're not killing stuff fast enough, the more downtime you spend on trying to battery him even with Tingyun + HH.

I am E0S1 with stacked relics and supports so I don't have an issue, but I can definitely see how the energy deficit vs just 1-2 elites can spiral out of control.
>Destructions and the hunts herta light cones have only light a 5 to 10 percent damage decrease compared to other signature light cones.

No they're not. It depends on the character. Here is the damage difference referenced by Prydwen:

Jingliu - 15% from S5 Aeon

Blade - 32% from S1 Secret Vow

DHIL - 13% from S5 Aeon

Ratio - 12% from S5 Cruising

And here's the damage difference for limited Erudition units. I included the BP light cone for low spenders (it's the only good BP light cone):

Argenti - 15% from S5 Breakfast, 4% from S5 Peaceful Day

Jing Yuan - 17% from S5 Breakfast, 7% from S5 Peaceful Day

As you can see, Blade has the worst light cone selections, as his "F2P" option is a gacha light cone.
    Fair enough.
"laughably easy"? Its possible but it by no means easy...
    [deleted]
        So never spent on refresh is your benchmark for "laughably easy"? okay then...

Cause for me, if someone say it's easy I figure it as 1 week of farming relic.
"Yada yada, yall are pathetic. What's so hard getting these stats? Just lucksack it."

Ya jackass, you're talking like the gear substats are guaranteed to drop, and rolls go to the correct stats you're looking for. Shut the fuck up. Im already lucky if i can fully gear a character in 3 weeks without fuel refills.
>idk how long you have been playing

Since day one

>just grind the domains

I do. Crits are so rare. I get only CR or CD at best and then everything goes into another substat.

>there are people with like 75/200+ ratios

Whales ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
    i doubt the majority of even whales are spending money to grind out relics like that. it just takes time - it took me 5 weeks to get a decent ratio set (70-200) and even longer to get an argenti set. you just need to commit to farming for one unit instead of spreading yourself too thin
        This is exactly the point I was trying to make, it’s really not hard to get artifacts it’s just not instant
    Look, i think you’ve been farming other things, which is completely optimal for guaranteed upgrades. But how could you not have been stuck on the quantum domain for at least four months. Or really insert any domain. If its because of the characters you have guess thats understandable for whatever enjoyment you want.

Getting 64/180, 80/160 is really just the most serviceable amt of ratios you need.

I played star rail first couple ptches, stopped couple months and came back. Given I only hyperinvest two teams, I have two dpses with a solid 90/200 and 60/200. Didnt spend a penny on jacksht
        I farmed quantum first two months of the game. The best I got is 53.4/144.1. And since release of 1.5 I farm FUP/DoT domain. My Topaz has wild 57.4/120.6.

Like look at Seele. With her traces she has 5/74 at base. We are trying to get 75/200. With crit rate body and 8% from planar set we still need 29.6 CR just from substats. For CD even if you have 5\* LC with 30 CD you still need 78.6% from substats to achieve 200.

Getting 29.6 CR and 78.6 CD from substats AT THE SAME TIME is insanely lucky.
            He must be talking about Jingliu. Except of her, a 80/160 ratio is not easy to achieve. Possible, especially with outside buffs, but definitely not "everyone has it". Unless of course you play rainbow set, but that is only a good trade if their set is shit to begin with.


Of all my chars, only Ratio achieves this without their signature LC. 
                No my highest rated one is seele, next is Imbibitor. The hardest sht i find hard to farm was a helm piece somehow.
            Now its entirely possible you dont get sht for a year for a set, but the likelihood from you just spamming raimbow sets should net you at least close to 70/160. Idk maybe a select few of you out there are really unlucky but odds are you’ll get these stats eventually. Pickup smth else and have fun. Or go do whatever. 

These relic stats will be just a dent on your probable lifetime in this game.
        These stats are luck dependent. You could be like me where I had many many potential godly roll pieces, but they always roll flat stats. I have maxed out my relic inventory several times and crafted many relics. I could not get stats like that on any combination of my relics. Even so I still cleared everything in this game so even with trash stats and 4 star lightcones you can beat everything.

Not sure what a lot of relic farming is but I did some 700 or so relic calyx runs.
Pls link your account I'd like to look it up. 75/200 is hardly possible without grinding for months + whaling for theirsignature  Edit:

As I thought. Dude is a whale haha.
How the fuck it's not much? 140 is not much and even this is difficult to achieve
    [deleted]
        >If you get 10% cd per other pieces

Yeah, easy. Especially easy because I also need CR at the same time
Best budget options are E1 Guinaifen (with the Luka LC) and E4 Pela (with Luka LC). They can both guarantee his follow-up attack within a single team slot, which is the main requirement for Ratio to succeed.
With Pela and TY he's pretty good, you can try him in previous moc 12
Welt sustain is always an option (especially if you have RM). The enemy hardly ever had a turn when I used him that way on floor 12
Yeah you won’t need him at all since you have Welt and Ratio. It will be a lot better for you to save for either a DPS of a different element or a good support.
    my goal for now is getting sparkle since i use qinque a lot and i heard she will be like bronya which im desperate for. and i have no idea when i will lose my 50 50 to her. other units im aiming to get are jingliu and fu xuan i hope they are good characters to aim for. (i would like luocha too but i dont think i will have enough jades for him)
        Those are all going to be really good characters, sounds like you have a great plan!
            thanks i try to avoid making mistakes for first couple months at least
        Sparkle is good in general though i wouldn’t recommend using qinque until she’s atleast e4 (ideally e6) shes pretty meh before then, i recommend getting aventurine cuz he’s preservation limited so an automatic pull and another good dps could be really any other future character but Aventurine for sustain and sparkle for support can never go wrong
            ill get her to e4 on sparkle banner hopium    tbh im not interested in aventurine even if he turns out great cuz i need to collect some waifus first hehe maybe on his rerun
                Have you seen the new music video? Bro is cool but if you dont want to  then you’ll have to wait for either fu xuan or huo huo for sustain
        >i would like luocha too but i dont think i will have enough jades for him

Don't worry, his rerun will be in version 3.4 at the very least.

(Yes, I'm salty his rerun got postponed)
For gameplay yes, but it's never a waste to roll for a character if you like them.
    hes really fun i would like to get him but its quite expensive to get every character i want :(
I'd say yeah.

You got enough Imaginary coverage. So getting a DPS for an element you're missing or maybe getting a strong Harmony support would be more beneficial than Dhil.
Never listen to people that claim dhil stronger than Ratio thingy, only go for dhil if you like Dan Heng, of course.
Dan il is worth  if you plan to get his E2, at that point has more damage than ratiop in single target and a fuck ton more as soon as theres 2 or more enemys present

Ratio is good but it  struggles hard as soon as theres more than 2 enemys on the field , so he is lock to MoC pretty much , Dan il can be play on any game mode witouth issues

  
BUT... you probably better covering other roles if you new, mainly strong supports, like sparkle soon enough
Yeah, honestly at this point i think alot of people are realizing how good she is and as long as sp isn’t an issue shes better than luocha in every way
    Well yeah, if you take away luocha's main strength(super sp positive) he becomes worse than HH. That's exactly why they are different and they both have their uses
    Its also why HuoHuo with DHiL is very feast or famine. Either you just utterly crush the enemy with ults or you eventually blow out your sp economy. But man when you get DHIL Tingyun and HuoHuo in a team with someone like Yukong and everyone is speed tuned to make things happen… the damage is gross.
I can understand this mindset. If you have enough speed subs lying around or when loucha’s speed and sp gen dont matter cause you have enough sp, just go comfy haha dominate what btch
    Luocha*
A 3-star Abundance Cone, at S5 the wearer gets Advanced Forward by 20% everytime they use their Basic Attack
I doubt they will.
Consistency is Seele's second name, rules are meant to be broken as always
i mean they straight up calc her dmg without accounting for her resurgence at all lmao
Excel calculations ≠ Actual gameplay

Folks need to realize this as there's many factors that an ally can ult earlier than the simulated numbers
    It’s even worse for Seele’s case because resurgence gives her extra turn and basic attack advances her forward (which you use quite often when you play Seele) so there’s no way to reliably calculate the overall damage she’s getting from all the turn manipulation without making several assumptions.
I can't hear you over the qingqillion sound of qingqillion damage
    Did she ever outclass Seele in average cycles?
        no lol, as much as people love qq she is not better than seele (and QQ feels bad to play, Sparkle may fix this)
            Sparkle can give her skill pts but can't fix her randomness. And her problem is not even skill pts.
        Nope. Even though her appearance rate is significantly lower which gives her an advantage.
            There was a MoC, probably during DHIL release where the blessing was amazing for QQ, which makes sense since she works nearly the same as DHIL.

I switch them around depending how I feel anyway since both work, QQ gameplay is still the most fun in the game imo tho.

Fuck it we draw
                You are probably talking about one of QQ’s teams performing better than a Seele team during that MOC cycle because QQ has never been above Seele in the average MOC cycle chart.
    The QQ sect exists only in reddit, Seele remains as queen 👑
    This ain't simulated universe
Even in 1.0 Jing Yuan wanters keep saying Seele users are gonna regret pulling when Jing Yuan power crept her.
    I regret not pulling JY because his kit is cool as hell
She needs her blessings of propagation
    People love to shit on Seele for some reason, especially the QQ sect.
        They're mad they don't have her
            Me having both, enjoying QQ gamba for SU and Seele if MoC gets too serious, though in the end both work.

Can't wait for sparkle for true monoquantum tho
        I see that same sentiment from Seele mains towards QQ. Which is fine, but doesn't make Seele mains stand out as better than those.
            The Seele main call deluded QQ sect on their bullshit and lie their spread to shit on Seele, they don't shit on other character.

Can end up a little heated sometime but not a surprise a lot of people are fed up with QQ sect bullshit because they can't accept that E6 QQ can't compete with Seele in any category and with any limited 5\* dps.
                I mean I would agree with you that bashing of a character feels wrong. I wouldn't want Seele to be bashed without reason and knowledge as well, but saying QQ E6 is worse than any limited 5\* dps is so wrong.

If we are talking about PF I completely agree. If we are talking about MoC, then no. You are basing that on? Let me know.
                    The only limited DPS that is worse than her in MoC is Argenti due to his mechanics (hates 1-2 targets w/o summons)
            Ehh we're more busy calling each other or Seele frauds, suffering from shitty relic gacha and shipping seele with Bronya to care about QQ
                Well, I've looked at the recent QQ post on the front page of this sub. That may altered my impression. 
                    are you sure, those post either exclude Seele's existence as a mono quantum character or present QQ as a top tier character even though she is the incarnation of gacha itself and not always reliable.
                        Nobody cares if she is always reliable or not. People like playing her because of the gamble part. But even then, her average is pretty reliable already. People are shitting on the character without much thought and rehash the same problems people said before people caught on that she actually is very good. Of course not Jingliu/DHIL good, nobody should debate that.

Also I don't understand how that post should include Seeles existence if it is specifically how QQ got buffs nearly every patch. Seele mains just come in and say "actually Sparkle is a big buff for Seele as well" which nobody debated. But somehow there is a need to go in shit on the character, praise Seele and then leave? There are good quantum options even without Seele and not every quantum post must involve her. Granted, I find the people who are commenting under every Seele thing a QQ copypasta or similar thing irritating as well.

If I look into most post histories of people commenting hate to QQ, I see them posting on Seele mains a lot or have some other connection to her, than it is so obvious what is happening. That's literally my point I made and that still stands as strong as ever.
                            Not the amount of money posts of quantum girls that happen to exclude seele? Which are obviously passive aggressive attacks on her considering that everyone is quantum, you're just attention seekers that are mad at something, don't really care what is it about
Dont worry. Everyone is going to realize that Seele is better with Sparkle anyway. Let them cope. (Note this does not apply to Propagation spam QQ in SU. Shes stupid in that mode. This is coming from a quantum dps main who literally has a built Seele, QQ, and Xueyi  just because I like them. Lol)
I can solo sustain with Lynx, but it lose a lot of damage
All three premium sustains are sitting on the utilization table. This isnt a lynx issue. Its people not really using any of the other 4 star sustains in general except for niche uses like Lynx blade
In the new event Despair mode he can kill an entire bar of Bronya/Gepard before they recover from break. It's hilarious.
Break effect Luka? Sound interesting. I should build him. I'm guessing it's just about stacking attack and break effect?
    Yep, you should definetly try it, even a mid-investment build is impressive
    Yes, just stack as much BE as possible and time his attacks to break physical weak enemies. Bleed with lots of BE stacked is very strong, so he does work that way as a sub-DPS.
Yeah. And Ruan Mei buffed him a lot. I've seen a video of him 0-cycling the Deer (current floor 12). Tried to recreate it myself, and it was one of the easiest 0-cycles I've ever had. His 200k-300k break hits are no joke.
    Does he need constellations ?
        His e6 helps if you are aiming for 0-cycling. But he can work even at e0.
    what is the build? i have him c6 but never used bc i dont care for dot teams and figured he was dot related?
        You basicly just stack break effect. As much as you can. His relics sets and planar sets don't really matter: Musketeer, Prisoner, Thief, 2+2 combo, Talia, SSS, Glamoth - anything works. All you need is to plan your actions - to ensure he is the one who lands break hits.

My Luka has 2.7k atk, 192% BE, 139 spd. 4pc Musketeer and 2pc Glamoth, LC - s5 Fermata. Not optimal, but works anyway.
            What team works with him?
                His current best teammates are:

1. Ruan Mei (break efficiency) - it takes less hits to break enemies.
2. SW - deals a lot of toughness damage, applies physical weakness, shreds defence.
            [deleted]
                Leveling up his talent definitely wouldn't hurt. Also, his a6 trace synergies very well with his e6 (if you have it) - for extra bleed dmg triggering.
                    [deleted]
                        His enhanced basic attack makes all bleed effects deal damage immediately; break bleed included. Leveling his talent will increase the triggering damage.
ah didnt see the "each stage"! good work on the data love to see it
The turbulence forwards him when you have no SP left. Not much to do in that situation.

His E2 forwards him and gives him a free fully enhanced basic attack. Huge difference.
You're ignoring the fact IL's Ult provides 3 Squama Stacks which are basically 3 SPs while the Turbulence pulls him up with no extra SPs to work with


I did comfortably clear the second half using 3 cycles with IL but I had to use normal Basic Attack multiple times which only really made me waste Tingyun buff turns
    It is just a 100% forward with 1 more addtional sp, meanwhile Ratio E2 is free massive damage, no turn spending required, so buff is retained and not using sp.
        Lol "just" 💀
            Well you see what that "just" did for him in this MoC
                Missed the part about the e2 giving him a free 3BA?

You cannot read
LOL tell me you dont know what E2 dan doesn witouth telling me 

His E2 push him forward but also give him 3 skill point to use, thats the big differencem this turbulence advanc him forward and your are stuck doing a normal auatoatack , pretty useless
His E2 gives him the three SP he needs to instantly attk. This is very different from having your attk timing completely botched by getting forwarded before your team can generate SP.
His E2 gives him SP after the ult, the MOC turbulence doesn't.
Learn what his E2 actually does before blabbering out of your ass. It literally directly counters him with this current turbulent blessings
Sorry i didn't make my question clear, why is E2 Dan consider op and not a single person calling Ratio E2 op yet?
Fair enough, though i played every single day since i joined the game and bought every single bp, i only joined during Fu banner, was mid Sep i think. I farmed quite a bit the quant for both QQ and Jing together, but prolly not enough compared to day 1 players when it comes to quant set fatm
    My biggest regret in this game was not getting Jing Yuan light cone. It has been painful farming for relics to get the appropriate amount of crit when his light cone would instantly fix all my problems. It is like a cheat code that saves you 4 months of farming or more.
Nah they wouldn't do that to Acheron, she's the Raiden expy after all !

    Not really, you could just spam SP to attack just to remove that mechanic
She dont need that shit either. Woman gets more than a free crit rate body worth of crit rate for practically free and a truck load of attk. Her damage floor is disgusting.
Well too bad, Jingliu havers are gonna be the ones crying. Because out of the 10 new Penacony mobs, only 3 of them are weak to ice.

Not to mention that neither of the 2 new bosses are weak to ice (but they both have lightning weakness lol)
    They have quantum weakness so she does get 20% Def shred
        So does every other dps with the quantum set. Not matching the element also mean you can break the ennemy shield effectively. Not to mention the 20% ice resistance they have.
            The Res is cancelled because of the set. It's a no weakness no Res enemy for JL,the other dps do have quantum set but they have better relic sets. JL has the worst relic options in the game
    I mean, having ice weak enemies only meant breeze clears for Jingliu. I personally want more challenge and have SW anyways :\

It was just weird to me to wish for a character to drop down
        >It was just weird to me to wish for a character to drop down

I personally understand the feeling, if the meta is always the same for a long time it starts to get boring, having variety is good !
            Agree :)
Nah, Topaz is better than Pela starting at S1, she has a 50% FUA damage increase and 24%crit damage AND personal good damage versus 40%def shred for Pela. The only reason you would use Pela is if you really need an SP generator. Heck, SW is a better option if you just need a debuffer.

If you look at the CN chart, the TY, Topaz, Ratio, Huohuo team is the 3rd highest after no sustain JL and DHIL.
    Like i say now with a lot more data Topaz is worst than most combination of Pela, ting and ruan mei consistently, it has being the case on every MoC so far ... so seems i was right
    CN data takes into account all eidolons so any team with multiple 5 stars is gonna be on top as they can have a lot of team with all E6 skewing the data , Tthe data we have here is a lot more representative of normal f2p - low spender players

So for normal people Ting + pela is stronger tna Topaz + SW as shown here , you need eidolons and/or signature lighctones for the other comp to be stronger , pela + ting is literally plug and play witouth using a single pull

  
Like i have E2 S1 Dan IL , for a E2 S1 he is probably the strongest dps, would i call him the strongets dps when talking in a reddit thread about MoC statistics that are meant for F2P ? not at all , same thing for thos ecomps, if they need multiple 5 stars and signature lightcones to be a bit better than characters you get for free then their pull value is pretty low
Yeah this is perhaps it. Blade is my favourite character and I love to see him doing well but I'm under no delusion that he performs better than Seele.
    Well this data is 10-12 floor combined he’s excellent on floor 11, so it’s may be it as well
        This is what annoys me about their data. Just focus on floor 12.
            And 3* clears
Tingyun gives massive a buffs and energy so that’s already something
I think MoC has the thing where it puts like 8 debuffs on the enemy? SW becomes over redundant at that point. You need more buffers then anything to get massive damage. HuoHuo is also there and she gives energy and huge atk buff on ult plus refunds Tingyun a bit. Pela honestly feels the most replaceable in the team, you could swap her out for Topaz and get about the same result if said enemy was weak to fire anyway.

All that energy gives Ratio more ults and more follow ups which means more damage versus more debuffs that diminish due to the MoC turbulence.

Edit: Also another thing to think about is supports are built to be quick. They’ll atk multiple times to generate sp, with the right amount of debuffs the follow up becomes basically guaranteed which means fast = more damage

This is my assumption anyway
    I tested both teams not on the current MoC, but the last reset before it so there is no debuff turbulence but yeah more energy really is amazing on Ratio
        If it was done on the last MoC then it's most likely the energy gain just outweighs the benefits of Debuffs which feels crazy to say. Just more Tingyun/HuoHuo Stonks I suppose
I don't think SP is the main reason that team is performing better. Ratio is of course SP- , TY is SP+, SW is SP neutral and HH can be played SP+. Even if TY's buff runs out quicker and she drops down to being SP neutral, the team, theoretically, should not be facing any SP issues.
I also think Pela's better ult uptime plus aoe shred lets her keep up with ratio better bcs he kills a single target so quick that SW struggles to keep up her ult def shred up against duo elites.

I think it's fairly ridiculous that my pela with only an energy regen rope alongside luka LC using technique plus skill can get her ultimate on her first turn, while my SW with tutorial and energy regen plus 5% from penacony set doing the same thing can't (pela becoming sp positive completely afterward doesnt help). I wish they'd change it so she can tbh, her energy cost is prob the most painful part about her bcs it forces me to save her ult meanwhile I don't hesitate to use pela's ult when i have it up.
Wait, people think Luocha is worse than Fu Xuan or HuoHuo?

I don’t own any of them, but each of them has their own separate utilities lol.

Luocha can basically AFK heal. FuXuan makes your team almost unkillable. HuoHuo makes a majority of debuffs worthless.

I don’t think its fair to compare them, but hey. JY gets shit on for a bunch of reasons so I am not surprised Luocha also gets shit on too.
    >I don’t think its fair to compare them

But it is. They fight for the same spot. If I have to build two teams and need one sustain per team, I have to make a choice between them.

Luocha heals a lot and is SP positive but FX and HH have other gimmicks that make them overall more valuable (HH has ATK buff and energy regeneration - and becomes SP neutral at E1, FX has crit rate and damage split).
    Well he not cute.
    The advantages FX and Huohuo have are their crit rate and Atk/energy buffs. Luocha has SP positivity but that's rarely if ever needed if you're clearing quickly. Running a cloud set (which Huohuo's best in slot regardless) gives you some extra leeway too.

Luocha's definitely better than Huohuo for sustaining your team but is overkill once your team has enough investment.
    Ok, here's a serious answer, he have no future. his Eidolon are too crappy compare to Fu Xuan or Huohuo.
You said it yourself. It screws with rotations and buff uptime.
I mean I did say 5 star eidolons... I asked because i believe the cycles only take e0 5stars into account so was wondering if the same is for appearance rate. I know 4 stars with eidolons arent excluded coz thats just doesn't makes sense.
thats my go-to team though 🥲
i don't have RM. tho i do have bronya. idk if she's a good match for  jingliu
    She is! Bronya is good with everyone really
        oh thanks. time to build my bronya now
so they use the same team on both sides and add their total cycle used?
so the last picture, the one of dan heng who used a median of 7.5 cycles. Means the average dan heng player player used 3.75 cycles 1st and 2nd side?
    Kinda yes , its a bit skewed since its only 18 submissions tho ; so not really the average Dan heng i'd say
        thank you for taking the time to answer. I always thought it was weird and assumed it was just subside 1 or 2. wish they could average for each side.
            Unfortunately it's not possible with the data that we have, which comes from Hoyolab. Until Hoyolab updates their data (very unlikely), we'll keep showing this kind of data.
So should i bother building her? Or wait to pull for a better dps? I'm thinking Dan Heng.
    if you want a strong physical dps and tolerate her counter based gameplay then yes

the only other competition she has in that role is argenti and sushang but you also don't *need* a physical dps
        I found pairing her with Lynx is pretty good, since Lynx makes enemies focus her so she procs her attacks way more often specially with ult. 

But yeah idk if i want to heavily invest into a physical dps. Maybe pair her WITH Dan Heng so she tanks some damage from him? Build her tank-ish? But would that mess with his "optimal" team? Whatever that is...
            she doesn't need any tank stats you just always build like a normal crit dps

you can pair her with other dps too yeah, she can just work as a sub dps that spams basics to generate SP while contributing good ddamage from counters
                Yeah i think I'd like a sub-dps build for my 2nd team. 

Thanks
            Lynx is a good healer but if you have Tingyun (which is a permanent slot in Clara teams) then you can easily use any other 5* sustain that you got.

Clara is super resilent to meta and MOC, you won't regret building her at all. This MOC features some of the worst effects (action advance, 2nd side deer does not attack first turn, few Physical weak enemies) and she still cleanly clears quick enough.
    I found her very good in a dual dps team since she does not consume a lot of skill points. Her teams are not that fast but they are comfy.

Team I used was Clara, Lynx, Ruan Mei, Sushang against the physical weak floors. It was really easy. With Ruan Mei buff Sushang can break those elites in one skill, ultimate, skill combo.
        Alright cool! Ty!
We are going to have at least two more MoC cycle with floors full of imaginary weakness, so he is most likely going to remain very strong for a while.
    For sure, but you can't really take his current stats and place into a general evaluation considering this buff massively buffed him and his hunt peers (And Jingliu because we are still in her lovechild phase).
Ive seen it and its shows that overgeared Jingliu can carry almost anyone.  


All i am saying is 4 star supports in this game are so much better than 4 star sustain that one might consider running a team without one.   


Offence is the best defense. If you need heal it just means you are not killing them fast enough smh  


Thanks for the infographics tho
Ooooh thanks a lot.......i just started 1.5 and this is my First time seeing this list. *Me watching Argenti being the Lowest who is Also my Main Dps. I know he is good for Pure Fiction.*
Thanks, also it's interesting to see what the good teams are cuz my current roster allows me for max Ratio/PhysStelle/Asta/Gepard, lol
I hope they cook just as much with Aventurine 🙏
    They sorta have to because of that image. Why would you pull for another sustain unit when, realistically, you only need 2 to clear the endgame content? That's probably their biggest challenge with designing Preservation/Abundance units.

My guess is that he'll lean into adding more damage to the team directly, since one of the LC we got in the new MoC store for Preservation is highly damage focused, which would be useless for all our current Preservation units.
        They should go for niche characters
            I think so too, like a DoT sustain or a follow up one for example
            I'm so torn, because on one hand, I think niche characters are cool since they open up new avenues of gameplay.

On the other hand, someone like Ruan Mei has infinitely more use and pull value for an account than, say, Topaz will. One can be slotted into a lot of teams for optimal or slightly sub-optimal builds, the other can only really interact with FU-focused units.
                Thats great actually, if every character was like ruan mei and didn’t have a niche there would be a big problem in the game
                    I guess my concern would be "how niche?" 

You don't want characters who are so niche that, outside of one or maybe two teams, they're not very good, because then you get an issue w/ new players (or players who have to pick and choose who to pull) where it's like "Well, I want Black Swan, but I don't want Kafka and \[Third Unit for BS\]" or "Well, I want Black Swan, but I cannot afford to pull for Kafka and \[Third Unit for BS\]."
        or they'll just make harder content that basically requires you to run the new support
            Swarm and GaG in a nutshell.

It's not necessarily necessary to have gotten Daniel/Fu Xuan or Argenti, but I'd be lying if it didn't feel like they made it way easier if you didn't have existing, cracked out units built.
    I think they will 
Ans even id he does end up being underwhelming they'll find a way to indurectly buff him with characters and relics
When ALL are OP. Then no one is. /s/s, if all are OP they still are OP. So it's good for us player base where we can use anyone we like 👍
    All the limited feel op of properly built
This is good cause you can main your fav without many problems (if your fav is a limited)
What the fuck were they cooking in rank 185
    It’s a substage 1 btw with almost full lightning-wind res. Maybe it comes from misconception that JY is too weak to fight alone and blade is an excellent sub dps for everyone
        Avg. cycles: 19 😩😩😩
    my bad
    I was running that team for quite a while tbh. Blade + bronya + luocha + flex works great with most dps. Rn I run jingliu in that spot. Blade doesn't consume any sp , luocha constantly generates them so you want someone else that uses sp to not overflow. JY was my go to for that before jingliu and it was a very consistent way to clear MoC 12 without much risk.
Holy fuck. Who added that bullshit into the data…
On any of the past turbulances SW + Topaz have perform worst than SW + Tingyun , Tingyun + Pela ,etc

So i was right
Fair enough.
[deleted]
    So never spent on refresh is your benchmark for "laughably easy"? okay then...

Cause for me, if someone say it's easy I figure it as 1 week of farming relic.
i doubt the majority of even whales are spending money to grind out relics like that. it just takes time - it took me 5 weeks to get a decent ratio set (70-200) and even longer to get an argenti set. you just need to commit to farming for one unit instead of spreading yourself too thin
    This is exactly the point I was trying to make, it’s really not hard to get artifacts it’s just not instant
Look, i think you’ve been farming other things, which is completely optimal for guaranteed upgrades. But how could you not have been stuck on the quantum domain for at least four months. Or really insert any domain. If its because of the characters you have guess thats understandable for whatever enjoyment you want.

Getting 64/180, 80/160 is really just the most serviceable amt of ratios you need.

I played star rail first couple ptches, stopped couple months and came back. Given I only hyperinvest two teams, I have two dpses with a solid 90/200 and 60/200. Didnt spend a penny on jacksht
    I farmed quantum first two months of the game. The best I got is 53.4/144.1. And since release of 1.5 I farm FUP/DoT domain. My Topaz has wild 57.4/120.6.

Like look at Seele. With her traces she has 5/74 at base. We are trying to get 75/200. With crit rate body and 8% from planar set we still need 29.6 CR just from substats. For CD even if you have 5\* LC with 30 CD you still need 78.6% from substats to achieve 200.

Getting 29.6 CR and 78.6 CD from substats AT THE SAME TIME is insanely lucky.
        He must be talking about Jingliu. Except of her, a 80/160 ratio is not easy to achieve. Possible, especially with outside buffs, but definitely not "everyone has it". Unless of course you play rainbow set, but that is only a good trade if their set is shit to begin with.


Of all my chars, only Ratio achieves this without their signature LC. 
            No my highest rated one is seele, next is Imbibitor. The hardest sht i find hard to farm was a helm piece somehow.
        Now its entirely possible you dont get sht for a year for a set, but the likelihood from you just spamming raimbow sets should net you at least close to 70/160. Idk maybe a select few of you out there are really unlucky but odds are you’ll get these stats eventually. Pickup smth else and have fun. Or go do whatever. 

These relic stats will be just a dent on your probable lifetime in this game.
    These stats are luck dependent. You could be like me where I had many many potential godly roll pieces, but they always roll flat stats. I have maxed out my relic inventory several times and crafted many relics. I could not get stats like that on any combination of my relics. Even so I still cleared everything in this game so even with trash stats and 4 star lightcones you can beat everything.

Not sure what a lot of relic farming is but I did some 700 or so relic calyx runs.
[deleted]
    >If you get 10% cd per other pieces

Yeah, easy. Especially easy because I also need CR at the same time
my goal for now is getting sparkle since i use qinque a lot and i heard she will be like bronya which im desperate for. and i have no idea when i will lose my 50 50 to her. other units im aiming to get are jingliu and fu xuan i hope they are good characters to aim for. (i would like luocha too but i dont think i will have enough jades for him)
    Those are all going to be really good characters, sounds like you have a great plan!
        thanks i try to avoid making mistakes for first couple months at least
    Sparkle is good in general though i wouldn’t recommend using qinque until she’s atleast e4 (ideally e6) shes pretty meh before then, i recommend getting aventurine cuz he’s preservation limited so an automatic pull and another good dps could be really any other future character but Aventurine for sustain and sparkle for support can never go wrong
        ill get her to e4 on sparkle banner hopium    tbh im not interested in aventurine even if he turns out great cuz i need to collect some waifus first hehe maybe on his rerun
            Have you seen the new music video? Bro is cool but if you dont want to  then you’ll have to wait for either fu xuan or huo huo for sustain
    >i would like luocha too but i dont think i will have enough jades for him

Don't worry, his rerun will be in version 3.4 at the very least.

(Yes, I'm salty his rerun got postponed)
hes really fun i would like to get him but its quite expensive to get every character i want :(
Well yeah, if you take away luocha's main strength(super sp positive) he becomes worse than HH. That's exactly why they are different and they both have their uses
Its also why HuoHuo with DHiL is very feast or famine. Either you just utterly crush the enemy with ults or you eventually blow out your sp economy. But man when you get DHIL Tingyun and HuoHuo in a team with someone like Yukong and everyone is speed tuned to make things happen… the damage is gross.
Luocha*
It’s even worse for Seele’s case because resurgence gives her extra turn and basic attack advances her forward (which you use quite often when you play Seele) so there’s no way to reliably calculate the overall damage she’s getting from all the turn manipulation without making several assumptions.
Did she ever outclass Seele in average cycles?
    no lol, as much as people love qq she is not better than seele (and QQ feels bad to play, Sparkle may fix this)
        Sparkle can give her skill pts but can't fix her randomness. And her problem is not even skill pts.
    Nope. Even though her appearance rate is significantly lower which gives her an advantage.
        There was a MoC, probably during DHIL release where the blessing was amazing for QQ, which makes sense since she works nearly the same as DHIL.

I switch them around depending how I feel anyway since both work, QQ gameplay is still the most fun in the game imo tho.

Fuck it we draw
            You are probably talking about one of QQ’s teams performing better than a Seele team during that MOC cycle because QQ has never been above Seele in the average MOC cycle chart.
The QQ sect exists only in reddit, Seele remains as queen 👑
This ain't simulated universe
I regret not pulling JY because his kit is cool as hell
People love to shit on Seele for some reason, especially the QQ sect.
    They're mad they don't have her
        Me having both, enjoying QQ gamba for SU and Seele if MoC gets too serious, though in the end both work.

Can't wait for sparkle for true monoquantum tho
    I see that same sentiment from Seele mains towards QQ. Which is fine, but doesn't make Seele mains stand out as better than those.
        The Seele main call deluded QQ sect on their bullshit and lie their spread to shit on Seele, they don't shit on other character.

Can end up a little heated sometime but not a surprise a lot of people are fed up with QQ sect bullshit because they can't accept that E6 QQ can't compete with Seele in any category and with any limited 5\* dps.
            I mean I would agree with you that bashing of a character feels wrong. I wouldn't want Seele to be bashed without reason and knowledge as well, but saying QQ E6 is worse than any limited 5\* dps is so wrong.

If we are talking about PF I completely agree. If we are talking about MoC, then no. You are basing that on? Let me know.
                The only limited DPS that is worse than her in MoC is Argenti due to his mechanics (hates 1-2 targets w/o summons)
        Ehh we're more busy calling each other or Seele frauds, suffering from shitty relic gacha and shipping seele with Bronya to care about QQ
            Well, I've looked at the recent QQ post on the front page of this sub. That may altered my impression. 
                are you sure, those post either exclude Seele's existence as a mono quantum character or present QQ as a top tier character even though she is the incarnation of gacha itself and not always reliable.
                    Nobody cares if she is always reliable or not. People like playing her because of the gamble part. But even then, her average is pretty reliable already. People are shitting on the character without much thought and rehash the same problems people said before people caught on that she actually is very good. Of course not Jingliu/DHIL good, nobody should debate that.

Also I don't understand how that post should include Seeles existence if it is specifically how QQ got buffs nearly every patch. Seele mains just come in and say "actually Sparkle is a big buff for Seele as well" which nobody debated. But somehow there is a need to go in shit on the character, praise Seele and then leave? There are good quantum options even without Seele and not every quantum post must involve her. Granted, I find the people who are commenting under every Seele thing a QQ copypasta or similar thing irritating as well.

If I look into most post histories of people commenting hate to QQ, I see them posting on Seele mains a lot or have some other connection to her, than it is so obvious what is happening. That's literally my point I made and that still stands as strong as ever.
                        Not the amount of money posts of quantum girls that happen to exclude seele? Which are obviously passive aggressive attacks on her considering that everyone is quantum, you're just attention seekers that are mad at something, don't really care what is it about
Yep, you should definetly try it, even a mid-investment build is impressive
Yes, just stack as much BE as possible and time his attacks to break physical weak enemies. Bleed with lots of BE stacked is very strong, so he does work that way as a sub-DPS.
Does he need constellations ?
    His e6 helps if you are aiming for 0-cycling. But he can work even at e0.
what is the build? i have him c6 but never used bc i dont care for dot teams and figured he was dot related?
    You basicly just stack break effect. As much as you can. His relics sets and planar sets don't really matter: Musketeer, Prisoner, Thief, 2+2 combo, Talia, SSS, Glamoth - anything works. All you need is to plan your actions - to ensure he is the one who lands break hits.

My Luka has 2.7k atk, 192% BE, 139 spd. 4pc Musketeer and 2pc Glamoth, LC - s5 Fermata. Not optimal, but works anyway.
        What team works with him?
            His current best teammates are:

1. Ruan Mei (break efficiency) - it takes less hits to break enemies.
2. SW - deals a lot of toughness damage, applies physical weakness, shreds defence.
        [deleted]
            Leveling up his talent definitely wouldn't hurt. Also, his a6 trace synergies very well with his e6 (if you have it) - for extra bleed dmg triggering.
                [deleted]
                    His enhanced basic attack makes all bleed effects deal damage immediately; break bleed included. Leveling his talent will increase the triggering damage.
It is just a 100% forward with 1 more addtional sp, meanwhile Ratio E2 is free massive damage, no turn spending required, so buff is retained and not using sp.
    Lol "just" 💀
        Well you see what that "just" did for him in this MoC
            Missed the part about the e2 giving him a free 3BA?

You cannot read
My biggest regret in this game was not getting Jing Yuan light cone. It has been painful farming for relics to get the appropriate amount of crit when his light cone would instantly fix all my problems. It is like a cheat code that saves you 4 months of farming or more.

They have quantum weakness so she does get 20% Def shred
    So does every other dps with the quantum set. Not matching the element also mean you can break the ennemy shield effectively. Not to mention the 20% ice resistance they have.
        The Res is cancelled because of the set. It's a no weakness no Res enemy for JL,the other dps do have quantum set but they have better relic sets. JL has the worst relic options in the game
I mean, having ice weak enemies only meant breeze clears for Jingliu. I personally want more challenge and have SW anyways :\

It was just weird to me to wish for a character to drop down
    >It was just weird to me to wish for a character to drop down

I personally understand the feeling, if the meta is always the same for a long time it starts to get boring, having variety is good !
        Agree :)
Like i say now with a lot more data Topaz is worst than most combination of Pela, ting and ruan mei consistently, it has being the case on every MoC so far ... so seems i was right
CN data takes into account all eidolons so any team with multiple 5 stars is gonna be on top as they can have a lot of team with all E6 skewing the data , Tthe data we have here is a lot more representative of normal f2p - low spender players

So for normal people Ting + pela is stronger tna Topaz + SW as shown here , you need eidolons and/or signature lighctones for the other comp to be stronger , pela + ting is literally plug and play witouth using a single pull

  
Like i have E2 S1 Dan IL , for a E2 S1 he is probably the strongest dps, would i call him the strongets dps when talking in a reddit thread about MoC statistics that are meant for F2P ? not at all , same thing for thos ecomps, if they need multiple 5 stars and signature lightcones to be a bit better than characters you get for free then their pull value is pretty low
Well this data is 10-12 floor combined he’s excellent on floor 11, so it’s may be it as well
    This is what annoys me about their data. Just focus on floor 12.
        And 3* clears
I tested both teams not on the current MoC, but the last reset before it so there is no debuff turbulence but yeah more energy really is amazing on Ratio
    If it was done on the last MoC then it's most likely the energy gain just outweighs the benefits of Debuffs which feels crazy to say. Just more Tingyun/HuoHuo Stonks I suppose
>I don’t think its fair to compare them

But it is. They fight for the same spot. If I have to build two teams and need one sustain per team, I have to make a choice between them.

Luocha heals a lot and is SP positive but FX and HH have other gimmicks that make them overall more valuable (HH has ATK buff and energy regeneration - and becomes SP neutral at E1, FX has crit rate and damage split).
Well he not cute.
The advantages FX and Huohuo have are their crit rate and Atk/energy buffs. Luocha has SP positivity but that's rarely if ever needed if you're clearing quickly. Running a cloud set (which Huohuo's best in slot regardless) gives you some extra leeway too.

Luocha's definitely better than Huohuo for sustaining your team but is overkill once your team has enough investment.
Ok, here's a serious answer, he have no future. his Eidolon are too crappy compare to Fu Xuan or Huohuo.
She is! Bronya is good with everyone really
    oh thanks. time to build my bronya now
Kinda yes , its a bit skewed since its only 18 submissions tho ; so not really the average Dan heng i'd say
    thank you for taking the time to answer. I always thought it was weird and assumed it was just subside 1 or 2. wish they could average for each side.

I farmed quantum first two months of the game. The best I got is 53.4/144.1. And since release of 1.5 I farm FUP/DoT domain. My Topaz has wild 57.4/120.6.

Like look at Seele. With her traces she has 5/74 at base. We are trying to get 75/200. With crit rate body and 8% from planar set we still need 29.6 CR just from substats. For CD even if you have 5\* LC with 30 CD you still need 78.6% from substats to achieve 200.

Getting 29.6 CR and 78.6 CD from substats AT THE SAME TIME is insanely lucky.
    He must be talking about Jingliu. Except of her, a 80/160 ratio is not easy to achieve. Possible, especially with outside buffs, but definitely not "everyone has it". Unless of course you play rainbow set, but that is only a good trade if their set is shit to begin with.


Of all my chars, only Ratio achieves this without their signature LC. 
        No my highest rated one is seele, next is Imbibitor. The hardest sht i find hard to farm was a helm piece somehow.
    Now its entirely possible you dont get sht for a year for a set, but the likelihood from you just spamming raimbow sets should net you at least close to 70/160. Idk maybe a select few of you out there are really unlucky but odds are you’ll get these stats eventually. Pickup smth else and have fun. Or go do whatever. 

These relic stats will be just a dent on your probable lifetime in this game.
These stats are luck dependent. You could be like me where I had many many potential godly roll pieces, but they always roll flat stats. I have maxed out my relic inventory several times and crafted many relics. I could not get stats like that on any combination of my relics. Even so I still cleared everything in this game so even with trash stats and 4 star lightcones you can beat everything.

Not sure what a lot of relic farming is but I did some 700 or so relic calyx runs.
>If you get 10% cd per other pieces

Yeah, easy. Especially easy because I also need CR at the same time
Those are all going to be really good characters, sounds like you have a great plan!
    thanks i try to avoid making mistakes for first couple months at least
Sparkle is good in general though i wouldn’t recommend using qinque until she’s atleast e4 (ideally e6) shes pretty meh before then, i recommend getting aventurine cuz he’s preservation limited so an automatic pull and another good dps could be really any other future character but Aventurine for sustain and sparkle for support can never go wrong
    ill get her to e4 on sparkle banner hopium    tbh im not interested in aventurine even if he turns out great cuz i need to collect some waifus first hehe maybe on his rerun
        Have you seen the new music video? Bro is cool but if you dont want to  then you’ll have to wait for either fu xuan or huo huo for sustain
>i would like luocha too but i dont think i will have enough jades for him

Don't worry, his rerun will be in version 3.4 at the very least.

(Yes, I'm salty his rerun got postponed)
no lol, as much as people love qq she is not better than seele (and QQ feels bad to play, Sparkle may fix this)
    Sparkle can give her skill pts but can't fix her randomness. And her problem is not even skill pts.
Nope. Even though her appearance rate is significantly lower which gives her an advantage.
    There was a MoC, probably during DHIL release where the blessing was amazing for QQ, which makes sense since she works nearly the same as DHIL.

I switch them around depending how I feel anyway since both work, QQ gameplay is still the most fun in the game imo tho.

Fuck it we draw
        You are probably talking about one of QQ’s teams performing better than a Seele team during that MOC cycle because QQ has never been above Seele in the average MOC cycle chart.
They're mad they don't have her
    Me having both, enjoying QQ gamba for SU and Seele if MoC gets too serious, though in the end both work.

Can't wait for sparkle for true monoquantum tho
I see that same sentiment from Seele mains towards QQ. Which is fine, but doesn't make Seele mains stand out as better than those.
    The Seele main call deluded QQ sect on their bullshit and lie their spread to shit on Seele, they don't shit on other character.

Can end up a little heated sometime but not a surprise a lot of people are fed up with QQ sect bullshit because they can't accept that E6 QQ can't compete with Seele in any category and with any limited 5\* dps.
        I mean I would agree with you that bashing of a character feels wrong. I wouldn't want Seele to be bashed without reason and knowledge as well, but saying QQ E6 is worse than any limited 5\* dps is so wrong.

If we are talking about PF I completely agree. If we are talking about MoC, then no. You are basing that on? Let me know.
            The only limited DPS that is worse than her in MoC is Argenti due to his mechanics (hates 1-2 targets w/o summons)
    Ehh we're more busy calling each other or Seele frauds, suffering from shitty relic gacha and shipping seele with Bronya to care about QQ
        Well, I've looked at the recent QQ post on the front page of this sub. That may altered my impression. 
            are you sure, those post either exclude Seele's existence as a mono quantum character or present QQ as a top tier character even though she is the incarnation of gacha itself and not always reliable.
                Nobody cares if she is always reliable or not. People like playing her because of the gamble part. But even then, her average is pretty reliable already. People are shitting on the character without much thought and rehash the same problems people said before people caught on that she actually is very good. Of course not Jingliu/DHIL good, nobody should debate that.

Also I don't understand how that post should include Seeles existence if it is specifically how QQ got buffs nearly every patch. Seele mains just come in and say "actually Sparkle is a big buff for Seele as well" which nobody debated. But somehow there is a need to go in shit on the character, praise Seele and then leave? There are good quantum options even without Seele and not every quantum post must involve her. Granted, I find the people who are commenting under every Seele thing a QQ copypasta or similar thing irritating as well.

If I look into most post histories of people commenting hate to QQ, I see them posting on Seele mains a lot or have some other connection to her, than it is so obvious what is happening. That's literally my point I made and that still stands as strong as ever.
                    Not the amount of money posts of quantum girls that happen to exclude seele? Which are obviously passive aggressive attacks on her considering that everyone is quantum, you're just attention seekers that are mad at something, don't really care what is it about
His e6 helps if you are aiming for 0-cycling. But he can work even at e0.
You basicly just stack break effect. As much as you can. His relics sets and planar sets don't really matter: Musketeer, Prisoner, Thief, 2+2 combo, Talia, SSS, Glamoth - anything works. All you need is to plan your actions - to ensure he is the one who lands break hits.

My Luka has 2.7k atk, 192% BE, 139 spd. 4pc Musketeer and 2pc Glamoth, LC - s5 Fermata. Not optimal, but works anyway.
    What team works with him?
        His current best teammates are:

1. Ruan Mei (break efficiency) - it takes less hits to break enemies.
2. SW - deals a lot of toughness damage, applies physical weakness, shreds defence.
    [deleted]
        Leveling up his talent definitely wouldn't hurt. Also, his a6 trace synergies very well with his e6 (if you have it) - for extra bleed dmg triggering.
            [deleted]
                His enhanced basic attack makes all bleed effects deal damage immediately; break bleed included. Leveling his talent will increase the triggering damage.
Lol "just" 💀
    Well you see what that "just" did for him in this MoC
        Missed the part about the e2 giving him a free 3BA?

You cannot read
Idk why they keep pestering us with that dumb plant. Always found the deer annoying

So does every other dps with the quantum set. Not matching the element also mean you can break the ennemy shield effectively. Not to mention the 20% ice resistance they have.
    The Res is cancelled because of the set. It's a no weakness no Res enemy for JL,the other dps do have quantum set but they have better relic sets. JL has the worst relic options in the game
>It was just weird to me to wish for a character to drop down

I personally understand the feeling, if the meta is always the same for a long time it starts to get boring, having variety is good !
    Agree :)
This is what annoys me about their data. Just focus on floor 12.
    And 3* clears
If it was done on the last MoC then it's most likely the energy gain just outweighs the benefits of Debuffs which feels crazy to say. Just more Tingyun/HuoHuo Stonks I suppose
oh thanks. time to build my bronya now
thank you for taking the time to answer. I always thought it was weird and assumed it was just subside 1 or 2. wish they could average for each side.
    Unfortunately it's not possible with the data that we have, which comes from Hoyolab. Until Hoyolab updates their data (very unlikely), we'll keep showing this kind of data.
I found pairing her with Lynx is pretty good, since Lynx makes enemies focus her so she procs her attacks way more often specially with ult. 

But yeah idk if i want to heavily invest into a physical dps. Maybe pair her WITH Dan Heng so she tanks some damage from him? Build her tank-ish? But would that mess with his "optimal" team? Whatever that is...
    she doesn't need any tank stats you just always build like a normal crit dps

you can pair her with other dps too yeah, she can just work as a sub dps that spams basics to generate SP while contributing good ddamage from counters
        Yeah i think I'd like a sub-dps build for my 2nd team. 

Thanks
    Lynx is a good healer but if you have Tingyun (which is a permanent slot in Clara teams) then you can easily use any other 5* sustain that you got.

Clara is super resilent to meta and MOC, you won't regret building her at all. This MOC features some of the worst effects (action advance, 2nd side deer does not attack first turn, few Physical weak enemies) and she still cleanly clears quick enough.
Alright cool! Ty!
They should go for niche characters
    I think so too, like a DoT sustain or a follow up one for example
    I'm so torn, because on one hand, I think niche characters are cool since they open up new avenues of gameplay.

On the other hand, someone like Ruan Mei has infinitely more use and pull value for an account than, say, Topaz will. One can be slotted into a lot of teams for optimal or slightly sub-optimal builds, the other can only really interact with FU-focused units.
        Thats great actually, if every character was like ruan mei and didn’t have a niche there would be a big problem in the game
            I guess my concern would be "how niche?" 

You don't want characters who are so niche that, outside of one or maybe two teams, they're not very good, because then you get an issue w/ new players (or players who have to pick and choose who to pull) where it's like "Well, I want Black Swan, but I don't want Kafka and \[Third Unit for BS\]" or "Well, I want Black Swan, but I cannot afford to pull for Kafka and \[Third Unit for BS\]."
or they'll just make harder content that basically requires you to run the new support
    Swarm and GaG in a nutshell.

It's not necessarily necessary to have gotten Daniel/Fu Xuan or Argenti, but I'd be lying if it didn't feel like they made it way easier if you didn't have existing, cracked out units built.
Avg. cycles: 19 😩😩😩
