[[My initial thoughts on the Fatalis quest]]





Also if you need help we can get 3 guys to help max.
    We also can‚Äôt guarantee they‚Äôll have the required skill or even bring the appropriate gear to the hunt, if anybody even responds. Best we can do is tell you your request for help has been sent.
        We can also only give you a few crappy healing supplies that you may or may not be too dead to use.
            Also if you capture the monster we‚Äôll give you a couple of body parts, but we‚Äôre going to keep most of it.
                Oh and we're only gonna pay you peanuts.
                    And we can only rescue you about three times, we don't care if this monster will cause the end of the world. You get ko three times, you fail
                        Btw this applies as a whole to the team, not for each person.
                            Well obviously. Rescues are expensive. About a third of what we're willing to pay you for the kill. You go down three times we have to cut out losses. You can always find a new world.
                                Oh wait, how much alcohol did you drink before this? Well alright, I guess we can get you one more.
                                Also if you wanna earn some extra cash by capturing a monster during your expeditions without the assistance of the guild.  we'll take a huge cut of the materials and give you the leftovers for not taking one of our quests on the board
                                    Also you have a handler. They handle you. And the science stuff. You'll report to them. Bitch.
                    The richest person in this world is that bloody Forge Master, we literally supply him the raw materials and that bastard charges us hundreds of thousands of zennies to create an armor (which is going to be replaced by another one sooner or later) and when we resell that armor we don't even get half of what we paid for!!! Absolute Dungpod.

We the hunters who risk our lives for these ass holes and these ass holes instead of giving us free services for amour and weapon creation, charge us all most our whole mediocre earnings??!?!??!
What cost is that Forge Master incurring to charge so much??
We literally bring him all the material he needs!!!!!!!!
                        He needs to pay for the fuel for the forge, the buyable weapons, the forgeworkers, he needs to keep the tools they use functional, he needs to be sure that all of the machinery is functional, this is expensive stuff! As a fellow hunter, I understand it can be a bit expensive sometimes, but everyone has their own needs as well!
                            Also he operates at a colony, without much infrastructure of the Old World. I can imagine that a lot of stuff have to be imported.
                        Wait you sell armor?
                            I went through some desperate times buddy...
                    Bruh, I wouldn‚Äôt mind getting 50,000 bucks for 50 minutes of work

EDIT: Some of y‚Äôall are like, ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs dangerous!‚Äù Yeah, people have dangerous jobs in the real world too and some of them don‚Äôt even make 50k per _year_
                        50 minutes of work which is constantly life threatening, has you take notes of everything, has you fighting with heavy/draining to use weapons while constantly moving for around 30 mins usually, forces you to collect most of your equipment, supplying basic remedies for the major issues you might encounter while fighting a specific creature (along with not allowing you to keep most of those free supplies), and to top it off, practically forces you to go out and continue working because nobody else can do the job quite as good as you. 

At least you get a fancy room, I guess
                            You could do a few dangerous hunts for gear and then hunt overgrown chickens for a decent pay.
                                But nobody likes a wimp now do they
                        In the Monster Hunter world isn't 50 minutes almost 24 hours? I forget how long the day night cycle is
                            Interesting point. Still... I would not mind making 50,000 bucks in a day.
                        Would you say that when you have to fight monsters no one has even seen or heard of before ?
                I like to think that those are just the usable parts that are untouched or lightly damaged so when you carve you as a novice at dismantling can only salvage a few parts and  the handler or your palico dismanles it afterwards but they are not the best at it, and when you capture the monster a profesional does it but the parts are just badly damaged to salvage a lot more
                    That reminds me, hunter! Once you kill it, you've got 60 seconds to harvest parts and pick up anything the monster dropped during the fight. Then we're going to taze you and get you out.
                    With as much carving our hunters do I‚Äôd expect them to learn a thing or two about salvaging usable parts
                        We probably broke all the other parts
                            That‚Äôs true, we absolutely beat down on them after all
                            But if you dont cut the tail, you dont get it. Even though its literally right in front of you, fully intact
                                Bruised and damaged skin, and a rush of endorphins as the monster dies makes the tail no good.

If you cut it off before that then you can have a tail.
                                    I think they were saying when you capture the monster
                                    We're still not eating it, we're just using it as a handle to beat down other monsters.
                    Jokes on them. I get my works worth by breaking the head twice and then im out.
        Hey I always make sure to bring my geologist decos to endgame hunts
        Seriously, why isn't there an option to set minimum ranks when I host a quest
            Because rank just tells you how long someone's been playing, but not if that person got carried all the way to MR200 without learning anything
    Also you can bring a cat
        Also The cat will always die in one hit
            Also the cat has a drinking problem
                Is that really a problem tho?
                    It's only problem when the cat runs of drinks
                        I just hate seeing something I love turn to the drink due to the stress of saving my bitch ass
                    Drinking is never a problem
                        Name checks out
            Idk, Dr. Pete only ever got dropped against a handful of Monsters from base game to Icebourne. Also, Palicoes can survive Sapphire Star.
    Yeah and when any of you cart to the limit, the quest will immidiately fail and dismissed automatically.

What? God of fire? You need more chance? Nah bro, 3 cart, get it or leave it.
        Alright, since it's your first time and you're cool, I can get you 5 carts, but don't get cocky. That's √† one time deal and you're back to 3 after that!
            Since you ate some steak, you can have an extra cart BUT NO MORE AFTER THAT
                Ok fine. Since you teammate drank some ale you can have yet another extra cart. BUT THAT'S IT
                    Fine your cat can dump some booger stuff on you, that‚Äôs pretty funny so I‚Äôll give you one extra cart, BUT NO MORE
                        Oh, you think you're cute with your *moxie*? That's fine, but no one cheats the cart twice.
        God of fire literally burnt your ass.

Gets carted back to camp with nothing but a light concussion to the head.

~~Or subscribe to my theory of the hunter being carted is the clone of the one who died. They only brought 2 vats with them.~~
            Everyone knows hunters are robot created by government to watch us.

Maybe you cam subscribe to my theory instead
                *The Guild Knights would like to know your location*
    We also don't know whether they want to help out or want to be helped out.
    ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs superstition, bro. Can‚Äôt break tradition.‚Äù
    It‚Äôs either that or a cat
    And they will all share your carts allowance
    Or one guy and a couple cats.
    And if we die once we will left the game üí™üèº
Remember to eat well first or you're going to fucking die
    No we won't pay for your meal you freeloading sack of shit, also we need that monster captured.
    Remember to eat so to can die more
    Eat well, die anyways. Do it again.
We will watch you doing it alone from the camp
    ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt any of you help us?‚Äù
        Excitable dude did, and see where that got him!
            Got him straight into my favourite character list of this game along with the admiral is what it got him.
                It's a shame they pulled their punch. Him dying to save you would have been huge
                    I was hoping he'd look like Harvey Dent.
                    Especially since we've known him since MH4
                Fuck yeah for me this guy is a Hero now !
            Got him unscathed and slightly winded from what I saw. Capcom sucks at this sorta thing.
        BIRD UP
            Dan dan DAN!!
        Is that a Terminal Montage reference?

    ‚ÄúITS FLAME IS STILL AT FULL POWER‚Äù 

Serious Handler, he just one shotted my ass so you‚Äôd think I‚Äôd know.
    Sometimes at night I wake up in a cold sweat from a nightmare reliving fighting Xenojiiva while the handler screams at me about TEAMWORK and how WE can do it. PARD.
        You haven't felt true pain until you've had the Field Team Leader repeatedly yell into your ear about not whacking Alatreon with its elemental weakness 50 billion times
            The wosrst is when you have to use a ice weapon against a fire alatreon and they keep telling you that.

&#x200B;

I know  I messed up with the horns, please stop telling me that I suck.
                Or you are using ice and Alayreon switches to Ice making your Ice useless and you can't swap out without dying.
        Until you realize that Handler is Xenojiva.
    I turned off the voices while I was fighting Alatreon.  I was getting so mad at them that I was forgetting to dodge.
It destroyed an entire civilization but if it vaporizes you with fire breath we‚Äôll send a bunch of cats to save you
Also 

Human World:
We Need to evacuate!!

Evacuate within a few hours 

MH TRI:
We need to evacuate 

Literally the entire Moga Village stays because they trust in their Hunter
    Sometimes you just have to believe. Like when the commissioner told the general off because 2 hunters went to fight fatalis by themselves.
        Something about that (minor spoilers ahead).

Many of the major NPCs in World were *actual hunters* in previous games, right?

>!So how did the General get to his position without knowing dick about hunting?!<
            The games are, in my opinion, largely told in a perspective that every player character is so good at hunting that its awe inspiring. It's a shame because the cinematics used to be really cool. Like in (I think) MHFU it had an opening scene of gunner and melee hunters working together to make rathalos seem like nothing more than a minor annoyance. Yet the in game text and dialogue reads like even a great jagras can cause mass destruction.
            >!That's actually indirectly addressed in the epilogue bits post-hunt ‚Äî the Commission has a notably far more fluid leadership structure than the Guild. Commission leaders are expected to fill out any and every role if need be, whereas Guild leaders are a bit more... bureaucratic, to put it lightly.!<
                Yea. I both liked and disliked that explanation. It's very accurate, but the wording makes it sound a lot more flexible than it really is.
"We want you to kill this 50 meter abyssal god incarnation monster from hell. Alone. Underwater."
    Ah, yes. That classic of video.
        what video?
            "Monster Hunter in a Nutshell" I believe. 
Also an accurate description of MH3 village ending.
The day night cycle is 50min (4Min Dawn -> 25min Day -> 4min Dusk -> 17min Night).So 30min real time are actually 14,4 hours in mh universe. Thats alot of hunting time.
    That also explains why your hunter gets "hungry" by losing stamina.
    That explains the normal time limit - hunters need a bio break and lunch
        fucking sapphire star my ass cant skip a lunch or a nap
I always kinda thought about most hunts like this:  The handler does a majority of the research(or piecing together the research gathered by the hunter), or putting monster behaviors/patterns into place for the hunter. The hunter then takes that knowledge and heads out and does the hunt.  Now, as a video game we are kinda presented with the same areas again and again because its a game, and the areas are designed to be fun.  So while we have fought for the 500th time in the area of the ancient forest that has all the poison cups/stamina plants(I forget their name), it should be considered as more of a portrayal of a general idea/area the monsters would like to occupy(granted this idea does not work 100% of the time). 

Anyways, thats my 2cents ted talk.
    I always thought that it was the handler who has to handle the day-to-day of directing your braindead wargod of a hunter at a good target.
        "Yo that Nargacuga said your mama's a hoe!"
        The handler exists so hunters don't have to do Monster Hunter Accounting.
We brought a whole contingent of our best soldiers and hunters to kill this dragon.

But we'll just rely on this dude and his cat.
To be fair one of them requires you to kill them with literal money, while the other you're betting the crap out of them with some other god's left nut and forearm while cosplaying as a dragon.
    I cant tell which is which.
The funniest thing I though about what when you have to drive off zorah magdaros and they say is a massive job, and they need everyone‚Äôs help, but in the end it‚Äôs only you and like 4 other npc‚Äôs fighting.
Speedrunners: you have to kill this monster sub 5 mins or you are weak
Mines was more like "Fuck...ok."
What people haven't realized is that monster hunters are wage slaves, the absolute lowest of the low. They pay you peanuts for dangerous work. Heaven help you if you get injured on the job, they'll fix you a few times, give you another chance, but if you can't hack it, there are like 4 billion people waiting to hunt your monster.... They do not give a single shit about you. Oh your friend and support helper might have died, here's a replacement in less than an hour, you'd better fucking get back to hunting monsters, chop chop bitch, they don't fucking hunt themselves.... Well I mean, they do, but then we can't make pants out of them.
    But are you a wage slave if you carry more wealth in your armor than what most people will gain in their entire lives?
        Zenni probably has a terrible conversion rate to money used for things like pants.
    Monster hunters are clearly high-skilled essential petite bourgeois. Society can's make a step without them, and their body and their gear are the mean of production itself. I'm pretty sure that in terms of in-game lore there are not that many hunters. 

There are a plenty of ways to make a living in Monster Hunter world, working peaceful profession, that clearly should be paid worse than hunting huge monsters.
    Thats why we only get a few carves, the rest is taken to the pants factory so the rich can wear Dodogama Dickies

The parts we are rewarded are the parts too damaged to make stuff out of for the elite.
        Have you seen a single rich person in Monster Hunter series? I haven't. There are powerful people, influential people, smart people - but no rich people.
            Because they don't wanna interact with the plebs. We only see the commission and commoners.

Someone has to be funding them and the world governments.

To the player its just monsters and hunting but the world just has to have classes.
                It doesn't have to have classes actually. If you remember the backstory of Monster Hunter world, then you'll remember that it's actually a postapocalyptic world. The old advanced nation has destroyed itself because it didn't respect the nature and tried to bend everything to their will. Thanks to them, Hunters and other colonists have some pieces of advanced technology like gunlances.

Learning from the mistakes of the past, the new society found a new way of living - sustainable, ecologically safe, and without exploitation of sentient races. Even the way the hunts are conducted is respectable to the monsters - it gives them a chance to fight back.
    you could sell monster parts and the egg thingy
So true
I hate this requirement. You run out of time and fatalis just keeps fighting in the background.  At least make him run away or destructive finish the castle so the time limit is justified.
I read this very literally and immediately thought I must have missed the Beerus event.
And i'm still getting it done! Dropped em 6 times so far and got all his armor.
I feel like what we're playing is a super condensed version of what happens on a hunt.
... what monster hunters in human history?
    joe
        Oh, you mean Mr. Ligma?
Idk aren't Monster Hunter in the game like ridiculously strong. Grappling huge Monsters and swinging a sword 5 times their body weight lol.
I know it's a meme, but this one of those games were game play doesn't reflect the actual feel of time, but hunting one monster for days would not be fun at all.

P.S: Sry for my english
    And after a single jumpAnjanath's legs would be shattered and we could kill it at our leisure due to its inability to escape.
Speed runners: give me 5, 10 tops
Ahh yes the werewolf in human history
Lets be fair though. Our hunters are definitely not human.
Team Darkside : make it 5
Do not worry without it‚Äôs head it may very well be powerless
I can do it in 15. try me capcom
He'll do it in 3.
You can also make yourself immune to their preferred blight, and extremely resistant to their preferred element.
god of destruction which is also the incarnation of death
Yeah I hate time limits, would be nice for that to be turned off as a solo option. I play games for fun ,not rules.
    I mean guiding landa and expeditions exist.
Game play wise though I think the timers there to keep that sense of urgency in killing the beast. It would get kind of dull if you had unlimited time on every hunt
    Ppl made builds were palicos killed the monsters. Ull do just finr with 50 freakin mins brah. What r u doing where it takes u a freakin hour to kill a monster?
    Same. That's why I uninstalled MHW after this update. I had more fun in basic training than I did with the last few updates.
fought it for the first time yesterday before bed, not as bad as expected, but that does NOT mean is even remotely close to easy... 3 failures with 2 of them being with MR 500ish guys can confirm this .\_.
Kinda of noob 
So am struggling hard with the black dragon quest 
And finally got a lightbreak material ( main in switch axe but I can do anything) 
Which  lightbreak would yall recommend ? 
Suggestion on a build?
    so actually the lightbreak weapons aren‚Äôt something you‚Äôd want to use against Fatalis or Alatreon, they‚Äôre much more weak to elemental weapons. For Alatreon obviously just use the opposite element to what he starts in (if your quest says he starts in ice then use fire and vice versa), OR use a dragon element weapon for slightly less damage but useful for all phases regardless of what element he‚Äôs in. Once you kill alatreon enough to make his weapon series, use that weapon to go after fatalis. Since you‚Äôre a switch axe that means you‚Äôll be using the ‚ÄúDark Switch axe‚Äù which is already a phenomenal weapon. Against Fatalis the best strategy is actually to use a switch axe (lucky you) and pretty much just spam your zero sum discharge after grappling his face whenever you get openings. This does insanely high damage to his horns and once you get those broken off (usually first one will break in 2nd or 3rd phase) he becomes far weaker with his fire attacks and then just make sure to play cautiously and patiently while taking advantage of his more predictable attacks for damage
        Sweet. Thanks for the advice. I might need to farm to get mats for the dark switch ... I really appreciate  it
Absolute chads
We also can‚Äôt guarantee they‚Äôll have the required skill or even bring the appropriate gear to the hunt, if anybody even responds. Best we can do is tell you your request for help has been sent.

                        Well obviously. Rescues are expensive. About a third of what we're willing to pay you for the kill. You go down three times we have to cut out losses. You can always find a new world.
                            Oh wait, how much alcohol did you drink before this? Well alright, I guess we can get you one more.
                            Also if you wanna earn some extra cash by capturing a monster during your expeditions without the assistance of the guild.  we'll take a huge cut of the materials and give you the leftovers for not taking one of our quests on the board
                                Also you have a handler. They handle you. And the science stuff. You'll report to them. Bitch.
                The richest person in this world is that bloody Forge Master, we literally supply him the raw materials and that bastard charges us hundreds of thousands of zennies to create an armor (which is going to be replaced by another one sooner or later) and when we resell that armor we don't even get half of what we paid for!!!

As a fellow hunter, I understand it can be a bit expensive sometimes, but everyone has their own needs as well!
                        Also he operates at a colony, without much infrastructure of the Old World. I can imagine that a lot of stuff have to be imported.

            Is that really a problem tho?
                It's only problem when the cat runs of drinks
                    I just hate seeing something I love turn to the drink due to the stress of saving my bitch ass
                Drinking is never a problem
                    Name checks out
        Idk, Dr. Pete only ever got dropped against a handful of Monsters from base game to Icebourne. Also, Palicoes can survive Sapphire Star.
Yeah and when any of you cart to the limit, the quest will immidiately fail and dismissed automatically.

What? God of fire? You need more chance? Nah bro, 3 cart, get it or leave it.
    Alright, since it's your first time and you're cool, I can get you 5 carts, but don't get cocky. That's √† one time deal and you're back to 3 after that!
        Since you ate some steak, you can have an extra cart BUT NO MORE AFTER THAT
            Ok fine. Since you teammate drank some ale you can have yet another extra cart. BUT THAT'S IT
                Fine your cat can dump some booger stuff on you, that‚Äôs pretty funny so I‚Äôll give you one extra cart, BUT NO MORE
                    Oh, you think you're cute with your *moxie*? That's fine, but no one cheats the cart twice.
    God of fire literally burnt your ass.

Gets carted back to camp with nothing but a light concussion to the head.

~~Or subscribe to my theory of the hunter being carted is the clone of the one who died. They only brought 2 vats with them.~~
        Everyone knows hunters are robot created by government to watch us.

Maybe you cam subscribe to my theory instead
            *The Guild Knights would like to know your location*
We also don't know whether they want to help out or want to be helped out.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs superstition, bro. Can‚Äôt break tradition.‚Äù
It‚Äôs either that or a cat
And they will all share your carts allowance
Or one guy and a couple cats.
And if we die once we will left the game üí™üèº
No we won't pay for your meal you freeloading sack of shit, also we need that monster captured.
Remember to eat so to can die more
Eat well, die anyways. Do it again.
‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt any of you help us?‚Äù
    Excitable dude did, and see where that got him!
        Got him straight into my favourite character list of this game along with the admiral is what it got him.
            It's a shame they pulled their punch. Him dying to save you would have been huge
                I was hoping he'd look like Harvey Dent.
                Especially since we've known him since MH4
            Fuck yeah for me this guy is a Hero now !
        Got him unscathed and slightly winded from what I saw. Capcom sucks at this sorta thing.

    Is that a Terminal Montage reference?
        "Indeed i believe so"

Now that is a super obscure reference
        I H A V E T H I N G S
‚ÄúITS FLAME IS STILL AT FULL POWER‚Äù 

Serious Handler, he just one shotted my ass so you‚Äôd think I‚Äôd know.
Sometimes at night I wake up in a cold sweat from a nightmare reliving fighting Xenojiiva while the handler screams at me about TEAMWORK and how WE can do it. PARD.
    You haven't felt true pain until you've had the Field Team Leader repeatedly yell into your ear about not whacking Alatreon with its elemental weakness 50 billion times
        The wosrst is when you have to use a ice weapon against a fire alatreon and they keep telling you that.

&#x200B;

I know  I messed up with the horns, please stop telling me that I suck.
            Or you are using ice and Alayreon switches to Ice making your Ice useless and you can't swap out without dying.
    Until you realize that Handler is Xenojiva.
I turned off the voices while I was fighting Alatreon.  I was getting so mad at them that I was forgetting to dodge.
Sometimes you just have to believe. Like when the commissioner told the general off because 2 hunters went to fight fatalis by themselves.
    Something about that (minor spoilers ahead).

Many of the major NPCs in World were *actual hunters* in previous games, right?

>!So how did the General get to his position without knowing dick about hunting?!<
        The games are, in my opinion, largely told in a perspective that every player character is so good at hunting that its awe inspiring. It's a shame because the cinematics used to be really cool. Like in (I think) MHFU it had an opening scene of gunner and melee hunters working together to make rathalos seem like nothing more than a minor annoyance. Yet the in game text and dialogue reads like even a great jagras can cause mass destruction.
        >!That's actually indirectly addressed in the epilogue bits post-hunt ‚Äî the Commission has a notably far more fluid leadership structure than the Guild. Commission leaders are expected to fill out any and every role if need be, whereas Guild leaders are a bit more... bureaucratic, to put it lightly.!<
            Yea. I both liked and disliked that explanation. It's very accurate, but the wording makes it sound a lot more flexible than it really is.
Ah, yes. That classic of video.
    what video?
        "Monster Hunter in a Nutshell" I believe. 
Also an accurate description of MH3 village ending.
That also explains why your hunter gets "hungry" by losing stamina.
That explains the normal time limit - hunters need a bio break and lunch
    fucking sapphire star my ass cant skip a lunch or a nap
I always thought that it was the handler who has to handle the day-to-day of directing your braindead wargod of a hunter at a good target.
    "Yo that Nargacuga said your mama's a hoe!"
    The handler exists so hunters don't have to do Monster Hunter Accounting.
I cant tell which is which.
But are you a wage slave if you carry more wealth in your armor than what most people will gain in their entire lives?
    Zenni probably has a terrible conversion rate to money used for things like pants.
Monster hunters are clearly high-skilled essential petite bourgeois. Society can's make a step without them, and their body and their gear are the mean of production itself. I'm pretty sure that in terms of in-game lore there are not that many hunters. 

There are a plenty of ways to make a living in Monster Hunter world, working peaceful profession, that clearly should be paid worse than hunting huge monsters.
Thats why we only get a few carves, the rest is taken to the pants factory so the rich can wear Dodogama Dickies

The parts we are rewarded are the parts too damaged to make stuff out of for the elite.
    Have you seen a single rich person in Monster Hunter series? I haven't. There are powerful people, influential people, smart people - but no rich people.
        Because they don't wanna interact with the plebs. We only see the commission and commoners.

Someone has to be funding them and the world governments.

To the player its just monsters and hunting but the world just has to have classes.
            It doesn't have to have classes actually. If you remember the backstory of Monster Hunter world, then you'll remember that it's actually a postapocalyptic world. The old advanced nation has destroyed itself because it didn't respect the nature and tried to bend everything to their will. Thanks to them, Hunters and other colonists have some pieces of advanced technology like gunlances.

Learning from the mistakes of the past, the new society found a new way of living - sustainable, ecologically safe, and without exploitation of sentient races. Even the way the hunts are conducted is respectable to the monsters - it gives them a chance to fight back.
you could sell monster parts and the egg thingy
joe
    Oh, you mean Mr. Ligma?
And after a single jumpAnjanath's legs would be shattered and we could kill it at our leisure due to its inability to escape.
I mean guiding landa and expeditions exist.
Game play wise though I think the timers there to keep that sense of urgency in killing the beast. It would get kind of dull if you had unlimited time on every hunt
Ppl made builds were palicos killed the monsters. Ull do just finr with 50 freakin mins brah. What r u doing where it takes u a freakin hour to kill a monster?
Same. That's why I uninstalled MHW after this update. I had more fun in basic training than I did with the last few updates.
so actually the lightbreak weapons aren‚Äôt something you‚Äôd want to use against Fatalis or Alatreon, they‚Äôre much more weak to elemental weapons. For Alatreon obviously just use the opposite element to what he starts in (if your quest says he starts in ice then use fire and vice versa), OR use a dragon element weapon for slightly less damage but useful for all phases regardless of what element he‚Äôs in. Once you kill alatreon enough to make his weapon series, use that weapon to go after fatalis. Since you‚Äôre a switch axe that means you‚Äôll be using the ‚ÄúDark Switch axe‚Äù which is already a phenomenal weapon. Against Fatalis the best strategy is actually to use a switch axe (lucky you) and pretty much just spam your zero sum discharge after grappling his face whenever you get openings. This does insanely high damage to his horns and once you get those broken off (usually first one will break in 2nd or 3rd phase) he becomes far weaker with his fire attacks and then just make sure to play cautiously and patiently while taking advantage of his more predictable attacks for damage
    Sweet. Thanks for the advice. I might need to farm to get mats for the dark switch ... I really appreciate  it
We can also only give you a few crappy healing supplies that you may or may not be too dead to use.
    Also if you capture the monster we‚Äôll give you a couple of body parts, but we‚Äôre going to keep most of it.
        Oh and we're only gonna pay you peanuts.
            And we can only rescue you about three times, we don't care if this monster will cause the end of the world. You get ko three times, you fail
                Btw this applies as a whole to the team, not for each person.
                    Well obviously. Rescues are expensive. About a third of what we're willing to pay you for the kill. You go down three times we have to cut out losses. You can always find a new world.
                        Oh wait, how much alcohol did you drink before this? Well alright, I guess we can get you one more.
                        Also if you wanna earn some extra cash by capturing a monster during your expeditions without the assistance of the guild.  we'll take a huge cut of the materials and give you the leftovers for not taking one of our quests on the board
                            Also you have a handler. They handle you. And the science stuff. You'll report to them. Bitch.
            The richest person in this world is that bloody Forge Master, we literally supply him the raw materials and that bastard charges us hundreds of thousands of zennies to create an armor (which is going to be replaced by another one sooner or later) and when we resell that armor we don't even get half of what we paid for!!! Absolute Dungpod.

We the hunters who risk our lives for these ass holes and these ass holes instead of giving us free services for amour and weapon creation, charge us all most our whole mediocre earnings??!?!??!
What cost is that Forge Master incurring to charge so much??
We literally bring him all the material he needs!!!!!!!!
                He needs to pay for the fuel for the forge, the buyable weapons, the forgeworkers, he needs to keep the tools they use functional, he needs to be sure that all of the machinery is functional, this is expensive stuff! As a fellow hunter, I understand it can be a bit expensive sometimes, but everyone has their own needs as well!
                    Also he operates at a colony, without much infrastructure of the Old World. I can imagine that a lot of stuff have to be imported.
                Wait you sell armor?
                    I went through some desperate times buddy...
            Bruh, I wouldn‚Äôt mind getting 50,000 bucks for 50 minutes of work

EDIT: Some of y‚Äôall are like, ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs dangerous!‚Äù Yeah, people have dangerous jobs in the real world too and some of them don‚Äôt even make 50k per _year_
                50 minutes of work which is constantly life threatening, has you take notes of everything, has you fighting with heavy/draining to use weapons while constantly moving for around 30 mins usually, forces you to collect most of your equipment, supplying basic remedies for the major issues you might encounter while fighting a specific creature (along with not allowing you to keep most of those free supplies), and to top it off, practically forces you to go out and continue working because nobody else can do the job quite as good as you. 

At least you get a fancy room, I guess
                    You could do a few dangerous hunts for gear and then hunt overgrown chickens for a decent pay.
                        But nobody likes a wimp now do they
                In the Monster Hunter world isn't 50 minutes almost 24 hours? I forget how long the day night cycle is
                    Interesting point. Still... I would not mind making 50,000 bucks in a day.
                Would you say that when you have to fight monsters no one has even seen or heard of before ?
        I like to think that those are just the usable parts that are untouched or lightly damaged so when you carve you as a novice at dismantling can only salvage a few parts and  the handler or your palico dismanles it afterwards but they are not the best at it, and when you capture the monster a profesional does it but the parts are just badly damaged to salvage a lot more
            That reminds me, hunter! Once you kill it, you've got 60 seconds to harvest parts and pick up anything the monster dropped during the fight. Then we're going to taze you and get you out.
            With as much carving our hunters do I‚Äôd expect them to learn a thing or two about salvaging usable parts
                We probably broke all the other parts
                    That‚Äôs true, we absolutely beat down on them after all
                    But if you dont cut the tail, you dont get it. Even though its literally right in front of you, fully intact
                        Bruised and damaged skin, and a rush of endorphins as the monster dies makes the tail no good.

If you cut it off before that then you can have a tail.
                            I think they were saying when you capture the monster
                            We're still not eating it, we're just using it as a handle to beat down other monsters.
            Jokes on them. I get my works worth by breaking the head twice and then im out.
Hey I always make sure to bring my geologist decos to endgame hunts
Seriously, why isn't there an option to set minimum ranks when I host a quest
    Because rank just tells you how long someone's been playing, but not if that person got carried all the way to MR200 without learning anything

    Yea. I both liked and disliked that explanation. It's very accurate, but the wording makes it sound a lot more flexible than it really is.
"Monster Hunter in a Nutshell" I believe. 
Also an accurate description of MH3 village ending.
Because they don't wanna interact with the plebs. We only see the commission and commoners.

Someone has to be funding them and the world governments.

To the player its just monsters and hunting but the world just has to have classes.
    It doesn't have to have classes actually. If you remember the backstory of Monster Hunter world, then you'll remember that it's actually a postapocalyptic world. The old advanced nation has destroyed itself because it didn't respect the nature and tried to bend everything to their will. Thanks to them, Hunters and other colonists have some pieces of advanced technology like gunlances.

Learning from the mistakes of the past, the new society found a new way of living - sustainable, ecologically safe, and without exploitation of sentient races. Even the way the hunts are conducted is respectable to the monsters - it gives them a chance to fight back.
Oh and we're only gonna pay you peanuts.
    And we can only rescue you about three times, we don't care if this monster will cause the end of the world. You get ko three times, you fail
        Btw this applies as a whole to the team, not for each person.
            Well obviously. Rescues are expensive. About a third of what we're willing to pay you for the kill. You go down three times we have to cut out losses. You can always find a new world.
                Oh wait, how much alcohol did you drink before this? Well alright, I guess we can get you one more.
                Also if you wanna earn some extra cash by capturing a monster during your expeditions without the assistance of the guild.  we'll take a huge cut of the materials and give you the leftovers for not taking one of our quests on the board
                    Also you have a handler. They handle you. And the science stuff. You'll report to them. Bitch.
    The richest person in this world is that bloody Forge Master, we literally supply him the raw materials and that bastard charges us hundreds of thousands of zennies to create an armor (which is going to be replaced by another one sooner or later) and when we resell that armor we don't even get half of what we paid for!!! Absolute Dungpod.

We the hunters who risk our lives for these ass holes and these ass holes instead of giving us free services for amour and weapon creation, charge us all most our whole mediocre earnings??!?!??!
What cost is that Forge Master incurring to charge so much??
We literally bring him all the material he needs!!!!!!!!
        He needs to pay for the fuel for the forge, the buyable weapons, the forgeworkers, he needs to keep the tools they use functional, he needs to be sure that all of the machinery is functional, this is expensive stuff! As a fellow hunter, I understand it can be a bit expensive sometimes, but everyone has their own needs as well!
            Also he operates at a colony, without much infrastructure of the Old World. I can imagine that a lot of stuff have to be imported.
        Wait you sell armor?
            I went through some desperate times buddy...
    Bruh, I wouldn‚Äôt mind getting 50,000 bucks for 50 minutes of work

EDIT: Some of y‚Äôall are like, ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs dangerous!‚Äù Yeah, people have dangerous jobs in the real world too and some of them don‚Äôt even make 50k per _year_
        50 minutes of work which is constantly life threatening, has you take notes of everything, has you fighting with heavy/draining to use weapons while constantly moving for around 30 mins usually, forces you to collect most of your equipment, supplying basic remedies for the major issues you might encounter while fighting a specific creature (along with not allowing you to keep most of those free supplies), and to top it off, practically forces you to go out and continue working because nobody else can do the job quite as good as you. 

At least you get a fancy room, I guess
            You could do a few dangerous hunts for gear and then hunt overgrown chickens for a decent pay.
                But nobody likes a wimp now do they
        In the Monster Hunter world isn't 50 minutes almost 24 hours? I forget how long the day night cycle is
            Interesting point. Still... I would not mind making 50,000 bucks in a day.
        Would you say that when you have to fight monsters no one has even seen or heard of before ?
I like to think that those are just the usable parts that are untouched or lightly damaged so when you carve you as a novice at dismantling can only salvage a few parts and  the handler or your palico dismanles it afterwards but they are not the best at it, and when you capture the monster a profesional does it but the parts are just badly damaged to salvage a lot more
    That reminds me, hunter! Once you kill it, you've got 60 seconds to harvest parts and pick up anything the monster dropped during the fight. Then we're going to taze you and get you out.
    With as much carving our hunters do I‚Äôd expect them to learn a thing or two about salvaging usable parts
        We probably broke all the other parts
            That‚Äôs true, we absolutely beat down on them after all
            But if you dont cut the tail, you dont get it. Even though its literally right in front of you, fully intact
                Bruised and damaged skin, and a rush of endorphins as the monster dies makes the tail no good.

If you cut it off before that then you can have a tail.
                    I think they were saying when you capture the monster
                    We're still not eating it, we're just using it as a handle to beat down other monsters.
    Jokes on them. I get my works worth by breaking the head twice and then im out.
Is that really a problem tho?
    It's only problem when the cat runs of drinks
        I just hate seeing something I love turn to the drink due to the stress of saving my bitch ass
    Drinking is never a problem
        Name checks out
Ok fine. Since you teammate drank some ale you can have yet another extra cart. BUT THAT'S IT
    Fine your cat can dump some booger stuff on you, that‚Äôs pretty funny so I‚Äôll give you one extra cart, BUT NO MORE
        Oh, you think you're cute with your *moxie*? That's fine, but no one cheats the cart twice.
*The Guild Knights would like to know your location*
It's a shame they pulled their punch. Him dying to save you would have been huge
    I was hoping he'd look like Harvey Dent.
    Especially since we've known him since MH4
Fuck yeah for me this guy is a Hero now !
Or you are using ice and Alayreon switches to Ice making your Ice useless and you can't swap out without dying.
