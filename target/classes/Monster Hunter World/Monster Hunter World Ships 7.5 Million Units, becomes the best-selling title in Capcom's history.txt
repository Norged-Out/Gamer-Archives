[[Monster Hunter World Ships 7.5 Million Units, becomes the best-selling title in Capcom's history]]





As long as they have worthy DLC, new areas, more monsters, and just simply expand without disappointing its fan base, we’ll all be here for quite awhile. 
    I'm actually done with MHW for now. After I got the armour set that I wanted, I didn't really see much reason to keep on going. I don't mind the grind if I had a tangible goal to look forward to. Min/Maxing isn't exactly a tangible goal that I'm looking forward to. 

Edit: I'll most likely come back whenever they introduce new content but for now, I'm moving on to Shadow of the Colossus remake and back to Gwent
        If you aren't min/maxing,the most fun I've had is helping my friends through the game. I feel like a mini boss compared to them as I take a lot less damage. I've helped 5 friends through the game so far and it has yet to bore me. 
            Hey I still need my elders if you're bored lol
                Lol i would as i have today off, but unfortunately i still don't have Internet from that huge wind storm. I'll reply to you when i do though and we can knock 'em out of you're on xbox
                    Are you in Eastern MA?  They got wrecked.  Since I'm in Western MA, we haven't heard much of any other area due to the Cape getting steamrolled.
                        Nah I'm near the DC area. 
                            How bad did you guys get it?
                                My area had 330,000 homes without power for at least a day. My street had two transformers that were split in half and 6 areas where trees were piled up on the lines. I haven't heard of any casualties, fortunately. 

How about you? 


                                    I live in that area, too, in southern MD! My area didn't get hit too hard fortunately, but this makes 4 weeks in a row that I haven't been to my English class because of freak circumstances.
                            NOVA? Those winds were nutssss
                                Yeah one of my neighbors had all 6 trees in his front yard fall down. Luckily none of them hit his house but it took us a while day to get it cleaned up. I don't think nova/sova power companies were ready for the magnitude of this as i heard they had to get workers all the way from Kentucky to help out with the volume. Hats off to those guys. 
        the goal is that there are monsters. and you can hunt them! that's all there is. that's all there needs to be.
            Ya its literally the title. 
        Maybe you should do the challenging optional arenas where they give you set equipment. Actually fighting the monsters should be fun too.
        I will be at this for a while, I want to try out every weapon and so far it is only Bows, long sword and Hammers.   I don't even have all of those that I want.   So it will take a very long time.
            I'm in the middle of making all the weapons and killing all the monsters with all the weapons. 
            If you like melee, you should give Switch Axe a try soon. It has a bit less mobility than Hammer, but it has a much longer reach, is easy to time attacks to actually hit (unlike the Greatsword), and doesn't require any fancy moves to be at optimal damage like the Longsword. I consider it the best balance of damage, ease of use/ease of landing attacks out of the melee weapons.
        It's one of those "the journey is the goal"-type of games. It's the first MH I played but I don't really see how they could add an "endgame" to it without changing it in a major way. Sure they can keep adding new monsters and areas but playing through them when you are already decked out in tier 8 stuff wont take long either way.
            Since you are new to Monster Hunter, I asssume you have not heard of G rank which many consider to be the endgame of previous Monster Hunter games which could be implemented in World sooner or later. 
                I heard about it a couple of times, it's supposedly a more extreme version of what high rank is to normal. But in the end isn't that just more and harder monsters? MH isn't really an mmo, so either way you run out of stuff to do sooner or later. Not that this is a gripe for me though, the game is brilliant.
                    In other monster hunter games, G rank had several levels to it, and they were all brutal. I got to the lowest level of G rank before a Pink Rathian made me quit the game for a while, and I never really got around to beating it.
        Go for the platinum trophy, that’s my goal
            I agree.  There is a lot to do to get the platinum!
            Ive never gotten a platinum. Ever. Not even Witcher 3 and Persona 5, which are my favourite games of all time 
                Some games are easier to get than others, but this game to me seems very feasible if you're willing to invest the time and put in the work. I probably won't get it since this is my first MH game and I'm happily progressing at a snails pace, currently HR 12 at 42 hours. But I can see myself sticking with this game for awhile, so I figured it would be a good end game for me.
                    You think 42 hours is a snail's pace? I'm at over 100 and in terms of quests completed, I'm not even that far ahead of you. MH has so much content though, I spend so much time just making gear that I take forever to progress.
        What keeps me going is different weapons, so the game is still fresh to me , being a first time Hunter. Also planning on saving 4-5 weapons to use for the pc launch
            Man, I hope we can use the same account on PC as we do on consoles. But after playing this game for quite awhile and scratching my head at Capcom's extremely terrible online controls, I remain very doubtful that could happen.
        That's OK, you'll be back. Maybe even this Friday depending on rumors I've heard. 
            What rumors? I demand to know more!
                A certain monster..
                    Devil Joh? I knew he was coming in march, but never knew if there was a confirmed date. Is the rumor that he is coming this friday?
                        Yeah just the rumor I think. No official confirmation.
                        Well, besides the already confirmed Jho monster. I've heard they may release other monsters alongside him as well. 

These are just rumors though. I really hope they release batches of monsters rather than just one every so often but we'll have to see. 
                            Yeah i was thinking about this the other day, we can only hope and wait.
                        Well looking at the upcoming quest...

Title: A Simple Task (9*/Ancient Forest/HR30+)

Deliver 10 Gourmet shrooms

??? xD
                            Oh shit! That's definitively Jho, or Capcom trolling us big time.
        I would probably be like you, but I already know there's at least 2-3 weapon sets I really want to play with each with their own optimal armor system in my mind..  so.. I'll be building until I have at least 3 loadouts to run with at any given time lol... 
        i set myself a goal, to reach HR 100. and  also set sub-goals during that process.   Jewel farming, experimenting new weapons, acquiring all armour/weapons,   doing events.  basically playing every bit of the  game.
        Now you gotta augment everything
        I'm there with you. Got to HR101, did the three tempered elder quest on my first attempt in 35 mins. And now I find it hard to log in and do anything. 
            How many hours do you have so far? I'm 100 hours and still HR 29
                186hours. 
                202 as of today
    MHW scratches an itch for me that I haven't had since Diablo 2. Once I have maxed out 1 or 2 armor/weapon sets for my main Switch Axe build, I will move on to other weapons and other builds and will likely have enough content to play for a very long time. It reminds me of how I played Diablo 2 back in the day...enjoyed the gameplay so much that I would grind out different armor sets for different playstyles.

MHW has this in spades because the combat is just so much more compelling than any Diablo 2 clone (including D3).
    a long long while
Somebody show this to EA and Activision that you don't need lootboxes to sell the game.

Only complete games made with passion and without greed will succeed. See this game, witcher 3, and super mario oddysey as reference.
    That's the rub, though. Battlefront 2 had horrible press and still sold over 8m copies. They know you can still sell games, but why make some of the money when you can make all the money with the limitless profit potential of lootboxes? Idiots keep buying them, sadly.
        Monster Hunter seems to have been largely out of the public's eye here in the west though. They made an amazing game and came that close to a Star Wars title? Imagine how many more copies of BF2 would have been sold had they brought the quality that Monster Hunter brought. You'd have people like us on reddit raving about it, the general public raving about it, critics raving about... They might have sold a lot more. 

You have to think of how huge the draw of Star Wars is. I would have bought it straight away if the controversy hadn't happened and I saw some good reviews. I was going to wait till Monster Hunter World came out on PC but all the great reviews made me decide to buy it on PS4 first, and I'm definitely buying it on PC when it comes out so I can play with my friends who mostly PC game. 

The game is so good I'm going to buy it twice and convince a few friends to buy it too. That's not happening with BF2 and my money.
            I know what you are saying but you can't deny that even EA has made more money off of BF2 than Capcom will make off of Monster Hunter. Let's go one further GTA: Online making more money than that and Call of Duty probably banking the most. Companies see that there is merit into pissing fans off because of the other fans who still buy loot boxes and other nonsense. I would be shocked if the public outcry for no more loot boxes changes much, when in the end they see they can make money for MANY MANY years after launch vs. making it all up front and nothing later. Is it shitty for us consumers who HATE them, yup 100% it is. 
                Maybe, maybe not. They have to pay for the license, im wrong? 
                I 100% agree with you that EA made a fuckton off the Star Wars license, and the other games you mentioned are also incredibly popular IPs. And I agree that other companies see the money being made and want a piece of that pie. I'm just glad that Capcom are seeing this huge success on the back of a quality product and not just "hunting" the same whales that the rest of the industry, including other Capcom games, seem to be after.
                    Oh 100% and thank the lord (not even religious). They made the right decision in the end they put gamers first and shipped us a complete game in a time where that doesn't always happen anymore.
                        I do think it's sad that this behaviour is commendable now. We just have to show our support for the instances when it does happen, to encourage this kind of behaviour.
            Idk how many. But i would have bought the game. Didnt cause of the reviews. 
And im 46 years old, not rich but no money problem and huge SW fan. 


        8 million is not a success according to EA's standards. Forgot which article was that but I think it's forbes. You also have to consider that it's the most returned game when it was released in gamestop.
            It's different when you have a relatively unknown IPR in Monster Hunter in a western market compared to Star Wars which is massively popular worldwide.
                It is an it isn't. The reason why BF2 was unsuccessful and disappointing was not due to their total sales of the game but due to the fact they realized their 2-4 year plan was completely ruined and that their projections of money coming in for said years were completely wrong. Share holders don't like when you give them a number and the outcome is much lower.
                    Without a doubt that holds true.

But then if they'd had a relatively unknown IP, or one with almost no track record in their target market, and under promised shareholders then over delivered with 8m in sales then they wouldn't have got their asses kicked by them. 
                        Very true, MHW is a great success by any measure. Just kind of comparing apples to oranges with how their business models are set up differently. 
        But BF2 was released way earlier than MHW. Comparing it that way BF2 sold much less. I bet that MHW will reach the 8 million much earlier than BF2 did.
            Id wager bF2 goes to EA access within a few months and then they will add the millions of folks that use that to the sales numbers.
        I don't think it was sold. They stated shipped.  S bunch could be sitting at Walmart.
            From a publisher’s point of view, shipped = sold.  They got their money from the copies they’ve shipped, what the retailer does isn’t really their concern and doesn’t affect their bottom line.  That being said, retailers wouldn’t have ordered this many copies if they weren’t selling. 
                Capcom gave vague numbers though. They said 7.5 have been shipped, and "almost 7" players, so it seems to be between 6,8-7 actaully sold, which isn't that much of a difference to the shipped.
            Happy cake day.
        >Idiots keep buying them, sadly.

People not hating something you hate does not make them idiots.

This is the problem with reddit.  You guys state an opinion and think that it makes it fact.  Its not.  Most folks dont give two shits about loot boxes.

I do, so I dont purchase those games.  But others do and thats fine.  If they want to spend more money to get a full game, that is on them.

            EA had a profit margin of only $50M in 2012 just before their Ultimate Team took off. They now have a profit margin of close to $1 billion USD and saw the stock rise 600% in 5 years. It costs them 40 cents on the dollar to make actual games, but only 20 cents on the dollar to sell MTX like lootboxes. In that time, they actually spend $300m LESS on game development now than they did in 2012 and sales of actual units is about the same. Their profit is quite literally entirely lootboxes.

Only 10% of their playerbase ever bought MTX. Yet we see Ultimate Team being where they spend the bulk of their development resources in the sports games, while other parts languish. We now see games like BF2 where the lootboxes are the central focus of the game. Most people *DON'T* give a shit about lootboxes, yet you now can't escape them. COD:WW2 you literally have a "daily quest" to watch people open lootboxes to entice you into being jealous. (Which drop onto Normandy beach, breaking immersion)

EA and Activision both have patents filed now for new "monetization schema" where they do advanced analytics on what you do, what items your mouse hovers over, how you play, etc. in order to push more MTX at you. They talk about changing how they matchmake you in multiplayer games to entice you to stay in the game and parade people with items you looked at in front of you.

The executives no longer let them make games and add skins on the side. They now have a thick manual labeled "Monetization Plan" slapped with a thud onto the table in front of them and told to design a "service" around it that supports said plan.
            I'm not disagreeing with the first portion of your statement, but that last sentence struck a chord with me. The general consensus is that loot boxes are bad. The only way someone wouldn't know that everybody else thinks loot boxes are bad is if they actively avoid reddit and gaming journalism. We need to be making a much bigger deal about it than is being made. Bad practices need to be punished.
                Except its just your opinion that they are bad.

The guy that works 80 hours a week and doesnt have hours a day to play probably appreciates them.
                    I agree with the person that doesn't have time to"grind" paying to win. I don't think people care about that as much (there will always be haters). But the reason why lootboxes are so bad is because it's gambling. You are not guaranteed the item you want for the amount your pay. If said item was given for a set price then i think people wouldn't have this much hatred for it. Don't even get started on how kids are getting addicted to gambling at such a young age bc of lootboxes. 
                        Why is gambling bad?

You are also blaming the developer because parents' aren't controlling what their kids are doing online.  
                            Just Google why gambling is bad and you'll see how such an addictive thing like gambling can really ruin your life. Especially when you get addicted to it at a young age. 

I don't recall me ever saying I blame the devs. But if you want to go down this road, I would say they are part of the problem. There are so many parties at fault here. The devs, EA, the parents, the law makers. etc etc. Especially the law makers for not keeping up with the times and tackling this issue at the butt. How quick were they to regulate and enforce laws for children when it came to gambling at casinos? Pretty quickly... And they need to get on this matter too. 
                                I dont need to google why gambling is bad.

You are basically arguing that people dont have free will and that the EA developers are magically forcing them to do things.  They arent.

And the lawmakers already have laws against kids gambling.  ANd if kids are gambling using their parents' credit cards, their parents should be fined.

Its not EAs job to make sure you arent a shitty a parent.
    It's not always just about the games.  If you sell 30% fewer copies, but get 50% money out of each person, then the loot boxes were good.  
    Hope Anthem is just a futuristic Monster Hunter World but my hopes aren't high.

Also EA, Activision, Ubisoft don't make lootboxes to sell the game, the lootboxes are just to sell content after selling the game, they just prefer to sell less games but make millions of microtransitions...
        You always have borderlands 3 in the horizon. Borderlands 2 was a huge success cause it didnt had lootboxes
            Borderlands 2 came out on the cusp of the AAA lootbox age, shortly after ME3 introduced them. It did well because it was a good game. Not having Loot Boxes wasn't even a consideration at that point. 
                It's one of my favorite games.

I cannot wait for BL3.

If it comes out before Anthem I probably won't even give that game a try, if I'm being honest.

Where is my 7.5 million celebration login bonus ?
    Give it 2-3 weeks after its supposed to drop.

/s
Soooo......

$450 Million in just games sales (base game $60) I'm sure the figure is much larger and I'm glad it wasn't those other publishers or developers with this success.  This is a really good game, it slows down a little once you're augmenting but still a great time sink and worth the price of admission.

Think Capcom's revenue for 2017 was around $85 Million

Thanks  
    Capcom doesn't sell the game for $60 dollars. The retailers do. Capcom also needs to pay both Sony and Microsoft so they can sell the game on their platform. 
        they'll be doing better than 2017 though
        And they need to pay the devs and pay the huge marketing, so the profit is much smaller than what he said...
            Did MHW have lots of marketing?


                In Japan? Yes
                    Ah, yeah.  This is worldwide sales.  I somehow missed that on my first read-through.


        They sell their games for 60$, but they get 25% in return. The retailer don't decide on the 60$. The game developers do. They just give a percentage of the 60$ to the retailer and the console manufacturer. 
    Why so little? I thought resident evil sold a good amount.
It’s almost as if consumers appreciate honest business practices. 
    Fake news
Well deserved. MHW has a few issues here and there but it's been a lot of fun to play, especially on the big screen with an actual controller. Hopefully stuff like online, lack of monsters, etc can be fixed up along the way. 
    Lack of monsters? Explain yoself
        I think lack of variety in monsters is more accurate. Everything is some type of T-Rex or dragon, barring the 2 fish. Would be dope to see things like giant insects or like just a straight up bad ass wolf or lion or something. 
            You mean Odogaron and Teostra? Literally a Wolf and a Lion
                I think Teostra looks more like a Manticore. (Without the scorpion tail obviously)
                Lol pretty much
                To be fair, I literally had no idea Odogaron was supposed to be a wolf and I've captured him 4 times now. 
                Vespoid Queen and Atoraru Ka would be two unique and fun additions. I wouldn't mind Ketcha Watcha and Blangonga/Congalala would be cool.
                    That I agree. We need less predators. Vespoid/hornetaur kings, Congalala and the Hermitaur, I miss that crab.
                        I am honestly surprised Vespoid Queen wasn't thrown in as a little hidden thing, like kill 20 Vespoids in a single hunt/expedition and she shows up all pissed off. Something in the same vein as hitting Cuccos in Zelda or trying to "farm" the cows in the Witcher 3 and then the Chort shows up and murders you.
                Last time I checked lions don’t burst into flames or fly and wolves don’t have giant fangs. 
                    So you just want a normal Lion and a normal Wolf? LMAO obviously they need to change something if not this would be just a normal hunting game, not a fantasy one.
                        Are you saying you don't enjoy hunting the deer in wildspire?
                        Plus real life has a copyright on wolves and lions so they probably couldn't use them
            I think I understand what you mean.

Like how a lot of monsters are very similar to monsters from earlier areas,
            In a way, I believe that's why Trip included water zones and combat. There are only so many ways to choreograph terrestrial and flying monster combat. It wasn't everyone's cup of tea but id get pretty hyped to fight a Legiacrus. He was a terror in the water and a punching bag on land.
            I completely understand what you mean (you missed another specie, the Gerat Lizard one like Great Jagras, Great Girros and Dodogama) but I don't think that Uragaan and Radobaan fit your description too, do you think they are some sort of T-Rex???? (btw you meant to say Wyverns instes of Dragons... Dragons have 4 legs, Rathian, Rathalos, etc only have 2 legs, they are Wyverns).

That said I think Odogaron, Palomalu, Tobi-Kadashi, Kulu-Ya-Ku are very unique and don't fit your description at all...

Also I loved Legiana too.

My main complain are that there are many monsters that are the same but just with pallet swap, like Rathian, Rathalos, Pink Rathian and Azure Rathalos, they are all the same with different colours, that is fucking laziness..
                They have different AI and behaviours. And this pallet swap is a staple in the community for a lonh time already, they wouldn’t change it for the first *big* international release
        I'm coming from 4u and while I know it's not fair to compare the two rosters, I meant that I hope a good amount of them are added through dlc throughout the games lifespan.
        Look up Monster Hunter 4U's roster. Its ridiculous huge, especially if you include deviants
            Afaik the ultimate releases were expansions from the regular numeral releases. So world vs 4 is a better comparison here since world is still yet to have dlc, not world vs 4u. 

I mean, we don't have g Rank yet. More to come, yay!
                I would hesitate to compare World to a previous installment because we have yet to see this level of visual fidelity. It must take a  significant amount of time to create a new monster compared to other titles of the series. I absolutely want and expect more monsters to come, but temper that expectation based on the quality of content.

One thing, however, is that Kirin and Kuala have an uncanny resemblance to their respective predecessors. I don't think I've noted any new animations or significant changes to the models/textures. The rest of the roster, by comparison, is an obvious upgrade at the very least.
                     Kirin now casts a shadow. 
                    Fidelity wise the game looks nicer than the previous titles but honestly there's not much crazy going on here that would warrant any concern from a consumer or development perspective. 

Definitely keeping my expectations realistic, however, knowing how game dev and general product management works with being in both game/web dev vs what I've seen in world I would wager that there's a handful of monsters that the dev team can gleam off of to start with and hopefully the capability to modularize behavior. 

I'm excited for more and right now I'm loving what I've got. I'll continue to pay for this model over the handheld.
            Right, but they had to completely rework the game for world. It wouldn't be possible for them to sustain that amount on their first go.
        Rathian, Rathalos, Pink Rathian, Azure Rathalos, only here it is the same Monster in 4 different pallets...
             Rathian and Rathalos are very different. Similar but different. 
I am actually considering buying a second copy so my kid can play with me.  

This is the most fun i have had playing a video game while sober since Diablo 2.
Took em a while to get their heads out their asses and port this back to console.
    I love the fact that it came to a modern console as well, but the portable versions were wildly successful, so I can't really blame them too much.
If Destiny 2 wasnt the mess that it is, I never would have purchased MH. A big thank you goes out to Bungie for shitting the bed so thoroughly. 
Hopefully other Japanese companies see what kind of interest there is in North America for their IPs
    Greetings from europe, many players here, too.
    Im noticing Japenese IPs are coming over a bit more, like Sword Art Online just to name one....
        And Yakusa O! 
Hopefully their future plans for DLC and expansions have skyrocketed.  I'll gladly hand them my money.
    They said that all DLCs from Monster Hunter World will be free, if I’m correct 
        DLC yes but they will sell an Ultimate Version or something like that for sure just like they did before.
             As much as I like the game, buying 2 copies just to get additional content and difficulty is a big no no for me. They should definitely make the Ultimate a paid expansion this time. 
                Agree 100%
                    I think that's what they'll do since western audiences aren't as used to this marketing scheme. 
        Yes it will be and always has been 
I'm a newcomer and i must say i love this game.
Could have done this years ago if they'd given Dragons Dogma real co-op.  Shame, really.
The question is, how much really sold? Thats games shipped, i digitally downloaded mine and so did 2 of my friends. So add digital to that and what is the new magic number?
    It's in the first paragraph of the article:

Capcom Co., Ltd. (Capcom) today announced that Monster Hunter: World for the PlayStation®4 computer entertainment system and Xbox One*1 has shipped 7.5 million units worldwide (including digital download sales).
        Ok thanks.
    Next time read the article, not just the title.

>has shipped 7.5 million units worldwide (including digital download sales).
        Come on guy. Let’s keep this a friendly sub. 
Stellar game. Long time fan of the franchise and this was a complete overhaul in some ways. My fears of this being a superficial Port of a previous title was completely wiped away during the beta. 30 hours in and I had only hit High rank. A lot of good content and quality gameplay throughout and by far the best AAA gaming purchase in a long time.
    145 hours in here, only rank 14 (I'm waiting for my friends to catch up lol), and I get the same feeling still. Amazing game, well worth the price. I've bought games for double that price that gather dust because of the moneygrab.
        Good news is all the xp you gain will not disappear. It’s simply hidden. So as you finally progress through main story your level is gonna skyrocket 
            Is there XP? I don't know how hunter ranks work. I just assumed it arbitrarily went up as you did story missions but I've been going back and helping my friend with his since he got a late start so I'm still only rank 4 and starting the coral area expedition.
                Yes there is but you’re right in thinking your rank only goes up when doing story (for now) after you finish the main story your “cap” is lifted and all the xp you’ve been gaining gets added. If you really have been playing a lot you will probably hit the first cap immediately when beating the final boss 
        Im about 75 hours in at HR 14, not waiting for anyone but looking for these friggin' foot prints is killing me...

Took me like 4 hours to find the pink rathian trail, another 4 hours for nergigante and now i have to look for the elder dragon trail (and we know how many of them there are....) fml, other than that im loving it.
            I personnally didnt have any trouble with those tracks, the quests were done by the time I received the quest, except for Rotting Vale. 

If you spot them once, just focus on hunting something, and come back either later or after a quest at the exact same spot, and you'll gather another easy 2, then repeat a hunt or reload a new expedition.

I find that everything comes to fruitition in this game when you dont focus on the task at end, like when chasing for gems or special drops. Just have fun while giving it 5% of your brain's attention and  it will pop everytime.
            Once you find where the tracks are, just end the mission and launch an expedition back to the same spot. I did that for the elder dragon one and got all the prints in 4 expedition, so like 20 minutes.
I've never play(ed) another Monster Hunter game, but I can say this is the most fun I've had playing a game in very long time.  Well done Capcom!
This makes me so happy.

I've been interested in the series for a while (thanks to watching ProJared gush about the series from time to time.  Never really had any portable consoles, and was probably only playing WoW when Monster Hunter Tri was a thing.

I decided Monster Hunter World looked like a great time to jump into the series.  Friends and brothers agreed.  I picked up two copies (one for me, the other brothers).

I freaking love this game.  I'm only just now starting to farm elder dragons, and I've already put more time into this game than I did my 160 hour Breath of the Wild run (though, to be fair, I'm eagerly awaiting a "game of the year" edition BotW that contains all the DLC so I can rebuy it + a Switch to play it on, as I have the Wii U version!)

I will eagerly buy up any DLC they drop for this game, especially if that fabled "G-Rank" I've read about makes it's way to World... MOAR!
I just wish it had a levelling  component to it
    It has, but the cap just lifted after you done the last story mission.
maybe capcom will do something good with megaman now idk 
Wait for PC sales too
Imagine how many more it will sell when it hits PC.. I know I'm buying it again since all my IRL friends are on pc
10 million copy celebration DLC must be an armor transmog set!
Home run !!!!
I fear falcon May pull a street fighter on us with monster hunter' s growing success

Spell check is funny I am leaving the original

Capcom may
I am happy they are doing well and I hope sales continue to rise on console's.   I want a game with little to no loot boxes and microtransactions and free dlc to do well to show other companies that if they play fair people will love you for it.
Well deserved. I haven't had this much fun with a video game in what feels like years; I literally have to force myself to stop for breaks and other real life stuff. Now maybe the west can finally get their own MMO MH spinoff like Japan and China do...

Honestly, MHW finally gave me a reason to actually boot up and play my PS4 regularly. I've been with the series since 3U, and I've got to say, World is a G Rank expansion (and an actually-threatening final boss) away from being my favorite MH period.

Between worrying about work and school stuff, I have a huge backlog that includes stuff like Persona 5 and Mario Odyssey. Coming off the personal disappointment of Xenoblade Chronicles 2 (whose baffling design flaws/QOL omissions are still being fixed in piecemeal patches...at least it's free, I guess), World came out of the bloody gate near perfect with almost every streamline/QoL measure I didn't know I even wanted. Additionally, I've been dying for a HD Monster Hunter and they delivered it in spades.

My only real complaint is that the OST isn't too memorable outside a handful of exceptions and that it's really easy. Well, that and online multiplayer could be retooled so the Gathering Hub isn't so out of the way and devoid of life, lol -- just make all of Astera the new GH.

All this success for MH is going to bring out more clones and would-be MH Killers, lol. God Eater, Dauntless and Toukiden were only the beginning.
    I'd agree on the OST part. There are definitely some good ones out there, and in number the good ones outnumber the bland, but most of the time the bland ones are playing, negating the good.

 All the Elder Dragon Themes are great, especially Nerg's, the Odogoron hunt in the vale music is incredible, and the only thing dragging down Bazelgeuse's theme is that it's the same intro everytime. Even Zorah's theme is okay, despite me playing Battle of Heroes (Anakin vs Obi-wan theme.) or the Godzilla OST over it. That's more along the lines to spice the actual level up, not as a complaint about the music however. I even like the Galagaka music for it's tribalness in comparison to the orchestral music the monsters get. 

The rest, of which you spend the majority of the game listening to, are pretty forgettable however. I can mildly remember the Ancient Forest fight music, and that's it. 
Speculation is deviljo will be added soon, a few foke say 8th of this month!
Now will they release an English language localization for MHXX for DS and Switch? Since MHW won’t come to Switch (any time soon), this would be a great way to capitalize on the MHW enthusiasm and new players in the West.
It’s pretty amazing and scary considering there will be 100 different version of this game being released on 20 different platforms in the next ten years.
200 MILLION COPIES LATER!
It's pretty much one of my favorite games of all time already, glad it's doing so well.
This is my first MH title and I definitely get frustrated a lot as I learn the pace of the fights, but man when I get ahold of one of them with my switch axe and get the ele discharge right in the face it feels so amazing every time. Especially if its a monster I've been struggling with (looking at you Anjanath for the first time).
expect mhw super, ultra and a spinoff
This is my first MH game and I wish there was an Android game I could play while I'm away from home.
I think that it's on so many systems now helps. Imagine that number jump when it makes it to PC.
Without a doubt!
Hopefully this increase in plauerbase  encourages them to localize MHXX for the Switch!
    I am legit learning japanese right now with LingoDeer just so i can scrap by in MHXX hahaha
        Yep, I imported it and am struggling through using Google translate. It's not going well lol
Still can't receive those milestone rewards though...
    They've already been handed out
I'm actually done with MHW for now. After I got the armour set that I wanted, I didn't really see much reason to keep on going. I don't mind the grind if I had a tangible goal to look forward to. Min/Maxing isn't exactly a tangible goal that I'm looking forward to. 

Edit: I'll most likely come back whenever they introduce new content but for now, I'm moving on to Shadow of the Colossus remake and back to Gwent
    If you aren't min/maxing,the most fun I've had is helping my friends through the game. I feel like a mini boss compared to them as I take a lot less damage. I've helped 5 friends through the game so far and it has yet to bore me. 
        Hey I still need my elders if you're bored lol
            Lol i would as i have today off, but unfortunately i still don't have Internet from that huge wind storm. I'll reply to you when i do though and we can knock 'em out of you're on xbox
                Are you in Eastern MA?  They got wrecked.  Since I'm in Western MA, we haven't heard much of any other area due to the Cape getting steamrolled.
                    Nah I'm near the DC area. 
                        How bad did you guys get it?
                            My area had 330,000 homes without power for at least a day. My street had two transformers that were split in half and 6 areas where trees were piled up on the lines. I haven't heard of any casualties, fortunately. 

How about you? 


                                I live in that area, too, in southern MD! My area didn't get hit too hard fortunately, but this makes 4 weeks in a row that I haven't been to my English class because of freak circumstances.
                        NOVA? Those winds were nutssss
                            Yeah one of my neighbors had all 6 trees in his front yard fall down. Luckily none of them hit his house but it took us a while day to get it cleaned up. I don't think nova/sova power companies were ready for the magnitude of this as i heard they had to get workers all the way from Kentucky to help out with the volume. Hats off to those guys. 
    the goal is that there are monsters. and you can hunt them! that's all there is. that's all there needs to be.
        Ya its literally the title. 
    Maybe you should do the challenging optional arenas where they give you set equipment. Actually fighting the monsters should be fun too.
    I will be at this for a while, I want to try out every weapon and so far it is only Bows, long sword and Hammers.   I don't even have all of those that I want.   So it will take a very long time.
        I'm in the middle of making all the weapons and killing all the monsters with all the weapons. 
        If you like melee, you should give Switch Axe a try soon. It has a bit less mobility than Hammer, but it has a much longer reach, is easy to time attacks to actually hit (unlike the Greatsword), and doesn't require any fancy moves to be at optimal damage like the Longsword. I consider it the best balance of damage, ease of use/ease of landing attacks out of the melee weapons.
    It's one of those "the journey is the goal"-type of games. It's the first MH I played but I don't really see how they could add an "endgame" to it without changing it in a major way. Sure they can keep adding new monsters and areas but playing through them when you are already decked out in tier 8 stuff wont take long either way.
        Since you are new to Monster Hunter, I asssume you have not heard of G rank which many consider to be the endgame of previous Monster Hunter games which could be implemented in World sooner or later. 
            I heard about it a couple of times, it's supposedly a more extreme version of what high rank is to normal. But in the end isn't that just more and harder monsters? MH isn't really an mmo, so either way you run out of stuff to do sooner or later. Not that this is a gripe for me though, the game is brilliant.
                In other monster hunter games, G rank had several levels to it, and they were all brutal. I got to the lowest level of G rank before a Pink Rathian made me quit the game for a while, and I never really got around to beating it.
    Go for the platinum trophy, that’s my goal
        I agree.  There is a lot to do to get the platinum!
        Ive never gotten a platinum. Ever. Not even Witcher 3 and Persona 5, which are my favourite games of all time 
            Some games are easier to get than others, but this game to me seems very feasible if you're willing to invest the time and put in the work. I probably won't get it since this is my first MH game and I'm happily progressing at a snails pace, currently HR 12 at 42 hours. But I can see myself sticking with this game for awhile, so I figured it would be a good end game for me.
                You think 42 hours is a snail's pace? I'm at over 100 and in terms of quests completed, I'm not even that far ahead of you. MH has so much content though, I spend so much time just making gear that I take forever to progress.
    What keeps me going is different weapons, so the game is still fresh to me , being a first time Hunter. Also planning on saving 4-5 weapons to use for the pc launch
        Man, I hope we can use the same account on PC as we do on consoles. But after playing this game for quite awhile and scratching my head at Capcom's extremely terrible online controls, I remain very doubtful that could happen.
    That's OK, you'll be back. Maybe even this Friday depending on rumors I've heard. 
        What rumors? I demand to know more!
            A certain monster..
                Devil Joh? I knew he was coming in march, but never knew if there was a confirmed date. Is the rumor that he is coming this friday?
                    Yeah just the rumor I think. No official confirmation.
                    Well, besides the already confirmed Jho monster. I've heard they may release other monsters alongside him as well. 

These are just rumors though. I really hope they release batches of monsters rather than just one every so often but we'll have to see. 
                        Yeah i was thinking about this the other day, we can only hope and wait.
                    Well looking at the upcoming quest...

Title: A Simple Task (9*/Ancient Forest/HR30+)

Deliver 10 Gourmet shrooms

??? xD
                        Oh shit! That's definitively Jho, or Capcom trolling us big time.
    I would probably be like you, but I already know there's at least 2-3 weapon sets I really want to play with each with their own optimal armor system in my mind..  so.. I'll be building until I have at least 3 loadouts to run with at any given time lol... 
    i set myself a goal, to reach HR 100. and  also set sub-goals during that process.   Jewel farming, experimenting new weapons, acquiring all armour/weapons,   doing events.  basically playing every bit of the  game.
    Now you gotta augment everything
    I'm there with you. Got to HR101, did the three tempered elder quest on my first attempt in 35 mins. And now I find it hard to log in and do anything. 
        How many hours do you have so far? I'm 100 hours and still HR 29
            186hours. 
            202 as of today
MHW scratches an itch for me that I haven't had since Diablo 2. Once I have maxed out 1 or 2 armor/weapon sets for my main Switch Axe build, I will move on to other weapons and other builds and will likely have enough content to play for a very long time. It reminds me of how I played Diablo 2 back in the day...enjoyed the gameplay so much that I would grind out different armor sets for different playstyles.

MHW has this in spades because the combat is just so much more compelling than any Diablo 2 clone (including D3).
a long long while
That's the rub, though. Battlefront 2 had horrible press and still sold over 8m copies. They know you can still sell games, but why make some of the money when you can make all the money with the limitless profit potential of lootboxes? Idiots keep buying them, sadly.
    Monster Hunter seems to have been largely out of the public's eye here in the west though. They made an amazing game and came that close to a Star Wars title? Imagine how many more copies of BF2 would have been sold had they brought the quality that Monster Hunter brought. You'd have people like us on reddit raving about it, the general public raving about it, critics raving about... They might have sold a lot more. 

You have to think of how huge the draw of Star Wars is. I would have bought it straight away if the controversy hadn't happened and I saw some good reviews. I was going to wait till Monster Hunter World came out on PC but all the great reviews made me decide to buy it on PS4 first, and I'm definitely buying it on PC when it comes out so I can play with my friends who mostly PC game. 

The game is so good I'm going to buy it twice and convince a few friends to buy it too. That's not happening with BF2 and my money.
        I know what you are saying but you can't deny that even EA has made more money off of BF2 than Capcom will make off of Monster Hunter. Let's go one further GTA: Online making more money than that and Call of Duty probably banking the most. Companies see that there is merit into pissing fans off because of the other fans who still buy loot boxes and other nonsense. I would be shocked if the public outcry for no more loot boxes changes much, when in the end they see they can make money for MANY MANY years after launch vs. making it all up front and nothing later. Is it shitty for us consumers who HATE them, yup 100% it is. 
            Maybe, maybe not. They have to pay for the license, im wrong? 
            I 100% agree with you that EA made a fuckton off the Star Wars license, and the other games you mentioned are also incredibly popular IPs. And I agree that other companies see the money being made and want a piece of that pie. I'm just glad that Capcom are seeing this huge success on the back of a quality product and not just "hunting" the same whales that the rest of the industry, including other Capcom games, seem to be after.
                Oh 100% and thank the lord (not even religious). They made the right decision in the end they put gamers first and shipped us a complete game in a time where that doesn't always happen anymore.
                    I do think it's sad that this behaviour is commendable now. We just have to show our support for the instances when it does happen, to encourage this kind of behaviour.
        Idk how many. But i would have bought the game. Didnt cause of the reviews. 
And im 46 years old, not rich but no money problem and huge SW fan. 


    8 million is not a success according to EA's standards. Forgot which article was that but I think it's forbes. You also have to consider that it's the most returned game when it was released in gamestop.
        It's different when you have a relatively unknown IPR in Monster Hunter in a western market compared to Star Wars which is massively popular worldwide.
            It is an it isn't. The reason why BF2 was unsuccessful and disappointing was not due to their total sales of the game but due to the fact they realized their 2-4 year plan was completely ruined and that their projections of money coming in for said years were completely wrong. Share holders don't like when you give them a number and the outcome is much lower.
                Without a doubt that holds true.

But then if they'd had a relatively unknown IP, or one with almost no track record in their target market, and under promised shareholders then over delivered with 8m in sales then they wouldn't have got their asses kicked by them. 
                    Very true, MHW is a great success by any measure. Just kind of comparing apples to oranges with how their business models are set up differently. 
    But BF2 was released way earlier than MHW. Comparing it that way BF2 sold much less. I bet that MHW will reach the 8 million much earlier than BF2 did.
        Id wager bF2 goes to EA access within a few months and then they will add the millions of folks that use that to the sales numbers.
    I don't think it was sold. They stated shipped.  S bunch could be sitting at Walmart.
        From a publisher’s point of view, shipped = sold.  They got their money from the copies they’ve shipped, what the retailer does isn’t really their concern and doesn’t affect their bottom line.  That being said, retailers wouldn’t have ordered this many copies if they weren’t selling. 
            Capcom gave vague numbers though. They said 7.5 have been shipped, and "almost 7" players, so it seems to be between 6,8-7 actaully sold, which isn't that much of a difference to the shipped.
        Happy cake day.
    >Idiots keep buying them, sadly.

People not hating something you hate does not make them idiots.

This is the problem with reddit.  You guys state an opinion and think that it makes it fact.  Its not.  Most folks dont give two shits about loot boxes.

I do, so I dont purchase those games.  But others do and thats fine.  If they want to spend more money to get a full game, that is on them.

        EA had a profit margin of only $50M in 2012 just before their Ultimate Team took off. They now have a profit margin of close to $1 billion USD and saw the stock rise 600% in 5 years. It costs them 40 cents on the dollar to make actual games, but only 20 cents on the dollar to sell MTX like lootboxes. In that time, they actually spend $300m LESS on game development now than they did in 2012 and sales of actual units is about the same. Their profit is quite literally entirely lootboxes.

Only 10% of their playerbase ever bought MTX. Yet we see Ultimate Team being where they spend the bulk of their development resources in the sports games, while other parts languish. We now see games like BF2 where the lootboxes are the central focus of the game. Most people *DON'T* give a shit about lootboxes, yet you now can't escape them. COD:WW2 you literally have a "daily quest" to watch people open lootboxes to entice you into being jealous. (Which drop onto Normandy beach, breaking immersion)

EA and Activision both have patents filed now for new "monetization schema" where they do advanced analytics on what you do, what items your mouse hovers over, how you play, etc. in order to push more MTX at you. They talk about changing how they matchmake you in multiplayer games to entice you to stay in the game and parade people with items you looked at in front of you.

The executives no longer let them make games and add skins on the side. They now have a thick manual labeled "Monetization Plan" slapped with a thud onto the table in front of them and told to design a "service" around it that supports said plan.
        I'm not disagreeing with the first portion of your statement, but that last sentence struck a chord with me. The general consensus is that loot boxes are bad. The only way someone wouldn't know that everybody else thinks loot boxes are bad is if they actively avoid reddit and gaming journalism. We need to be making a much bigger deal about it than is being made. Bad practices need to be punished.
            Except its just your opinion that they are bad.

The guy that works 80 hours a week and doesnt have hours a day to play probably appreciates them.
                I agree with the person that doesn't have time to"grind" paying to win. I don't think people care about that as much (there will always be haters). But the reason why lootboxes are so bad is because it's gambling. You are not guaranteed the item you want for the amount your pay. If said item was given for a set price then i think people wouldn't have this much hatred for it. Don't even get started on how kids are getting addicted to gambling at such a young age bc of lootboxes. 
                    Why is gambling bad?

You are also blaming the developer because parents' aren't controlling what their kids are doing online.  
                        Just Google why gambling is bad and you'll see how such an addictive thing like gambling can really ruin your life. Especially when you get addicted to it at a young age. 

I don't recall me ever saying I blame the devs. But if you want to go down this road, I would say they are part of the problem. There are so many parties at fault here. The devs, EA, the parents, the law makers. etc etc. Especially the law makers for not keeping up with the times and tackling this issue at the butt. How quick were they to regulate and enforce laws for children when it came to gambling at casinos? Pretty quickly... And they need to get on this matter too. 
                            I dont need to google why gambling is bad.

You are basically arguing that people dont have free will and that the EA developers are magically forcing them to do things.  They arent.

And the lawmakers already have laws against kids gambling.  ANd if kids are gambling using their parents' credit cards, their parents should be fined.

Its not EAs job to make sure you arent a shitty a parent.
It's not always just about the games.  If you sell 30% fewer copies, but get 50% money out of each person, then the loot boxes were good.  
Hope Anthem is just a futuristic Monster Hunter World but my hopes aren't high.

Also EA, Activision, Ubisoft don't make lootboxes to sell the game, the lootboxes are just to sell content after selling the game, they just prefer to sell less games but make millions of microtransitions...
    You always have borderlands 3 in the horizon. Borderlands 2 was a huge success cause it didnt had lootboxes
        Borderlands 2 came out on the cusp of the AAA lootbox age, shortly after ME3 introduced them. It did well because it was a good game. Not having Loot Boxes wasn't even a consideration at that point. 
            It's one of my favorite games.

I cannot wait for BL3.

If it comes out before Anthem I probably won't even give that game a try, if I'm being honest.

Give it 2-3 weeks after its supposed to drop.

/s
Capcom doesn't sell the game for $60 dollars. The retailers do. Capcom also needs to pay both Sony and Microsoft so they can sell the game on their platform. 
    they'll be doing better than 2017 though
    And they need to pay the devs and pay the huge marketing, so the profit is much smaller than what he said...
        Did MHW have lots of marketing?


            In Japan? Yes
                Ah, yeah.  This is worldwide sales.  I somehow missed that on my first read-through.


    They sell their games for 60$, but they get 25% in return. The retailer don't decide on the 60$. The game developers do. They just give a percentage of the 60$ to the retailer and the console manufacturer. 
Why so little? I thought resident evil sold a good amount.
Fake news
Lack of monsters? Explain yoself
    I think lack of variety in monsters is more accurate. Everything is some type of T-Rex or dragon, barring the 2 fish. Would be dope to see things like giant insects or like just a straight up bad ass wolf or lion or something. 
        You mean Odogaron and Teostra? Literally a Wolf and a Lion
            I think Teostra looks more like a Manticore. (Without the scorpion tail obviously)
            Lol pretty much
            To be fair, I literally had no idea Odogaron was supposed to be a wolf and I've captured him 4 times now. 
            Vespoid Queen and Atoraru Ka would be two unique and fun additions. I wouldn't mind Ketcha Watcha and Blangonga/Congalala would be cool.
                That I agree. We need less predators. Vespoid/hornetaur kings, Congalala and the Hermitaur, I miss that crab.
                    I am honestly surprised Vespoid Queen wasn't thrown in as a little hidden thing, like kill 20 Vespoids in a single hunt/expedition and she shows up all pissed off. Something in the same vein as hitting Cuccos in Zelda or trying to "farm" the cows in the Witcher 3 and then the Chort shows up and murders you.
            Last time I checked lions don’t burst into flames or fly and wolves don’t have giant fangs. 
                So you just want a normal Lion and a normal Wolf? LMAO obviously they need to change something if not this would be just a normal hunting game, not a fantasy one.
                    Are you saying you don't enjoy hunting the deer in wildspire?
                    Plus real life has a copyright on wolves and lions so they probably couldn't use them
        I think I understand what you mean.

Like how a lot of monsters are very similar to monsters from earlier areas,
        In a way, I believe that's why Trip included water zones and combat. There are only so many ways to choreograph terrestrial and flying monster combat. It wasn't everyone's cup of tea but id get pretty hyped to fight a Legiacrus. He was a terror in the water and a punching bag on land.
        I completely understand what you mean (you missed another specie, the Gerat Lizard one like Great Jagras, Great Girros and Dodogama) but I don't think that Uragaan and Radobaan fit your description too, do you think they are some sort of T-Rex???? (btw you meant to say Wyverns instes of Dragons... Dragons have 4 legs, Rathian, Rathalos, etc only have 2 legs, they are Wyverns).

That said I think Odogaron, Palomalu, Tobi-Kadashi, Kulu-Ya-Ku are very unique and don't fit your description at all...

Also I loved Legiana too.

My main complain are that there are many monsters that are the same but just with pallet swap, like Rathian, Rathalos, Pink Rathian and Azure Rathalos, they are all the same with different colours, that is fucking laziness..
            They have different AI and behaviours. And this pallet swap is a staple in the community for a lonh time already, they wouldn’t change it for the first *big* international release
    I'm coming from 4u and while I know it's not fair to compare the two rosters, I meant that I hope a good amount of them are added through dlc throughout the games lifespan.
    Look up Monster Hunter 4U's roster. Its ridiculous huge, especially if you include deviants
        Afaik the ultimate releases were expansions from the regular numeral releases. So world vs 4 is a better comparison here since world is still yet to have dlc, not world vs 4u. 

I mean, we don't have g Rank yet. More to come, yay!
            I would hesitate to compare World to a previous installment because we have yet to see this level of visual fidelity. It must take a  significant amount of time to create a new monster compared to other titles of the series. I absolutely want and expect more monsters to come, but temper that expectation based on the quality of content.

One thing, however, is that Kirin and Kuala have an uncanny resemblance to their respective predecessors. I don't think I've noted any new animations or significant changes to the models/textures. The rest of the roster, by comparison, is an obvious upgrade at the very least.
                 Kirin now casts a shadow. 
                Fidelity wise the game looks nicer than the previous titles but honestly there's not much crazy going on here that would warrant any concern from a consumer or development perspective. 

Definitely keeping my expectations realistic, however, knowing how game dev and general product management works with being in both game/web dev vs what I've seen in world I would wager that there's a handful of monsters that the dev team can gleam off of to start with and hopefully the capability to modularize behavior. 

I'm excited for more and right now I'm loving what I've got. I'll continue to pay for this model over the handheld.
        Right, but they had to completely rework the game for world. It wouldn't be possible for them to sustain that amount on their first go.
    Rathian, Rathalos, Pink Rathian, Azure Rathalos, only here it is the same Monster in 4 different pallets...
         Rathian and Rathalos are very different. Similar but different. 
I love the fact that it came to a modern console as well, but the portable versions were wildly successful, so I can't really blame them too much.
Greetings from europe, many players here, too.
Im noticing Japenese IPs are coming over a bit more, like Sword Art Online just to name one....
    And Yakusa O! 
They said that all DLCs from Monster Hunter World will be free, if I’m correct 
    DLC yes but they will sell an Ultimate Version or something like that for sure just like they did before.
         As much as I like the game, buying 2 copies just to get additional content and difficulty is a big no no for me. They should definitely make the Ultimate a paid expansion this time. 
            Agree 100%
                I think that's what they'll do since western audiences aren't as used to this marketing scheme. 
    Yes it will be and always has been 
It's in the first paragraph of the article:

Capcom Co., Ltd. (Capcom) today announced that Monster Hunter: World for the PlayStation®4 computer entertainment system and Xbox One*1 has shipped 7.5 million units worldwide (including digital download sales).
    Ok thanks.
Next time read the article, not just the title.

>has shipped 7.5 million units worldwide (including digital download sales).
    Come on guy. Let’s keep this a friendly sub. 
145 hours in here, only rank 14 (I'm waiting for my friends to catch up lol), and I get the same feeling still. Amazing game, well worth the price. I've bought games for double that price that gather dust because of the moneygrab.
    Good news is all the xp you gain will not disappear. It’s simply hidden. So as you finally progress through main story your level is gonna skyrocket 
        Is there XP? I don't know how hunter ranks work. I just assumed it arbitrarily went up as you did story missions but I've been going back and helping my friend with his since he got a late start so I'm still only rank 4 and starting the coral area expedition.
            Yes there is but you’re right in thinking your rank only goes up when doing story (for now) after you finish the main story your “cap” is lifted and all the xp you’ve been gaining gets added. If you really have been playing a lot you will probably hit the first cap immediately when beating the final boss 
    Im about 75 hours in at HR 14, not waiting for anyone but looking for these friggin' foot prints is killing me...

Took me like 4 hours to find the pink rathian trail, another 4 hours for nergigante and now i have to look for the elder dragon trail (and we know how many of them there are....) fml, other than that im loving it.
        I personnally didnt have any trouble with those tracks, the quests were done by the time I received the quest, except for Rotting Vale. 

If you spot them once, just focus on hunting something, and come back either later or after a quest at the exact same spot, and you'll gather another easy 2, then repeat a hunt or reload a new expedition.

I find that everything comes to fruitition in this game when you dont focus on the task at end, like when chasing for gems or special drops. Just have fun while giving it 5% of your brain's attention and  it will pop everytime.
        Once you find where the tracks are, just end the mission and launch an expedition back to the same spot. I did that for the elder dragon one and got all the prints in 4 expedition, so like 20 minutes.
It has, but the cap just lifted after you done the last story mission.
I'd agree on the OST part. There are definitely some good ones out there, and in number the good ones outnumber the bland, but most of the time the bland ones are playing, negating the good.

 All the Elder Dragon Themes are great, especially Nerg's, the Odogoron hunt in the vale music is incredible, and the only thing dragging down Bazelgeuse's theme is that it's the same intro everytime. Even Zorah's theme is okay, despite me playing Battle of Heroes (Anakin vs Obi-wan theme.) or the Godzilla OST over it. That's more along the lines to spice the actual level up, not as a complaint about the music however. I even like the Galagaka music for it's tribalness in comparison to the orchestral music the monsters get. 

The rest, of which you spend the majority of the game listening to, are pretty forgettable however. I can mildly remember the Ancient Forest fight music, and that's it. 
I am legit learning japanese right now with LingoDeer just so i can scrap by in MHXX hahaha
    Yep, I imported it and am struggling through using Google translate. It's not going well lol
They've already been handed out
If you aren't min/maxing,the most fun I've had is helping my friends through the game. I feel like a mini boss compared to them as I take a lot less damage. I've helped 5 friends through the game so far and it has yet to bore me. 
    Hey I still need my elders if you're bored lol
        Lol i would as i have today off, but unfortunately i still don't have Internet from that huge wind storm. I'll reply to you when i do though and we can knock 'em out of you're on xbox
            Are you in Eastern MA?  They got wrecked.  Since I'm in Western MA, we haven't heard much of any other area due to the Cape getting steamrolled.
                Nah I'm near the DC area. 
                    How bad did you guys get it?
                        My area had 330,000 homes without power for at least a day. My street had two transformers that were split in half and 6 areas where trees were piled up on the lines. I haven't heard of any casualties, fortunately. 

How about you? 


                            I live in that area, too, in southern MD! My area didn't get hit too hard fortunately, but this makes 4 weeks in a row that I haven't been to my English class because of freak circumstances.
                    NOVA? Those winds were nutssss
                        Yeah one of my neighbors had all 6 trees in his front yard fall down. Luckily none of them hit his house but it took us a while day to get it cleaned up. I don't think nova/sova power companies were ready for the magnitude of this as i heard they had to get workers all the way from Kentucky to help out with the volume. Hats off to those guys. 
the goal is that there are monsters. and you can hunt them! that's all there is. that's all there needs to be.
    Ya its literally the title. 
Maybe you should do the challenging optional arenas where they give you set equipment. Actually fighting the monsters should be fun too.
I will be at this for a while, I want to try out every weapon and so far it is only Bows, long sword and Hammers.   I don't even have all of those that I want.   So it will take a very long time.
    I'm in the middle of making all the weapons and killing all the monsters with all the weapons. 
    If you like melee, you should give Switch Axe a try soon. It has a bit less mobility than Hammer, but it has a much longer reach, is easy to time attacks to actually hit (unlike the Greatsword), and doesn't require any fancy moves to be at optimal damage like the Longsword. I consider it the best balance of damage, ease of use/ease of landing attacks out of the melee weapons.
It's one of those "the journey is the goal"-type of games. It's the first MH I played but I don't really see how they could add an "endgame" to it without changing it in a major way. Sure they can keep adding new monsters and areas but playing through them when you are already decked out in tier 8 stuff wont take long either way.
    Since you are new to Monster Hunter, I asssume you have not heard of G rank which many consider to be the endgame of previous Monster Hunter games which could be implemented in World sooner or later. 
        I heard about it a couple of times, it's supposedly a more extreme version of what high rank is to normal. But in the end isn't that just more and harder monsters? MH isn't really an mmo, so either way you run out of stuff to do sooner or later. Not that this is a gripe for me though, the game is brilliant.
            In other monster hunter games, G rank had several levels to it, and they were all brutal. I got to the lowest level of G rank before a Pink Rathian made me quit the game for a while, and I never really got around to beating it.
Go for the platinum trophy, that’s my goal
    I agree.  There is a lot to do to get the platinum!
    Ive never gotten a platinum. Ever. Not even Witcher 3 and Persona 5, which are my favourite games of all time 
        Some games are easier to get than others, but this game to me seems very feasible if you're willing to invest the time and put in the work. I probably won't get it since this is my first MH game and I'm happily progressing at a snails pace, currently HR 12 at 42 hours. But I can see myself sticking with this game for awhile, so I figured it would be a good end game for me.
            You think 42 hours is a snail's pace? I'm at over 100 and in terms of quests completed, I'm not even that far ahead of you. MH has so much content though, I spend so much time just making gear that I take forever to progress.
What keeps me going is different weapons, so the game is still fresh to me , being a first time Hunter. Also planning on saving 4-5 weapons to use for the pc launch
    Man, I hope we can use the same account on PC as we do on consoles. But after playing this game for quite awhile and scratching my head at Capcom's extremely terrible online controls, I remain very doubtful that could happen.
That's OK, you'll be back. Maybe even this Friday depending on rumors I've heard. 
    What rumors? I demand to know more!
        A certain monster..
            Devil Joh? I knew he was coming in march, but never knew if there was a confirmed date. Is the rumor that he is coming this friday?
                Yeah just the rumor I think. No official confirmation.
                Well, besides the already confirmed Jho monster. I've heard they may release other monsters alongside him as well. 

These are just rumors though. I really hope they release batches of monsters rather than just one every so often but we'll have to see. 
                    Yeah i was thinking about this the other day, we can only hope and wait.
                Well looking at the upcoming quest...

Title: A Simple Task (9*/Ancient Forest/HR30+)

Deliver 10 Gourmet shrooms

??? xD
                    Oh shit! That's definitively Jho, or Capcom trolling us big time.
I would probably be like you, but I already know there's at least 2-3 weapon sets I really want to play with each with their own optimal armor system in my mind..  so.. I'll be building until I have at least 3 loadouts to run with at any given time lol... 
i set myself a goal, to reach HR 100. and  also set sub-goals during that process.   Jewel farming, experimenting new weapons, acquiring all armour/weapons,   doing events.  basically playing every bit of the  game.
Now you gotta augment everything
I'm there with you. Got to HR101, did the three tempered elder quest on my first attempt in 35 mins. And now I find it hard to log in and do anything. 
    How many hours do you have so far? I'm 100 hours and still HR 29
        186hours. 
        202 as of today
Monster Hunter seems to have been largely out of the public's eye here in the west though. They made an amazing game and came that close to a Star Wars title? Imagine how many more copies of BF2 would have been sold had they brought the quality that Monster Hunter brought. You'd have people like us on reddit raving about it, the general public raving about it, critics raving about... They might have sold a lot more. 

You have to think of how huge the draw of Star Wars is. I would have bought it straight away if the controversy hadn't happened and I saw some good reviews. I was going to wait till Monster Hunter World came out on PC but all the great reviews made me decide to buy it on PS4 first, and I'm definitely buying it on PC when it comes out so I can play with my friends who mostly PC game. 

The game is so good I'm going to buy it twice and convince a few friends to buy it too. That's not happening with BF2 and my money.
    I know what you are saying but you can't deny that even EA has made more money off of BF2 than Capcom will make off of Monster Hunter. Let's go one further GTA: Online making more money than that and Call of Duty probably banking the most. Companies see that there is merit into pissing fans off because of the other fans who still buy loot boxes and other nonsense. I would be shocked if the public outcry for no more loot boxes changes much, when in the end they see they can make money for MANY MANY years after launch vs. making it all up front and nothing later. Is it shitty for us consumers who HATE them, yup 100% it is. 
        Maybe, maybe not. They have to pay for the license, im wrong? 
        I 100% agree with you that EA made a fuckton off the Star Wars license, and the other games you mentioned are also incredibly popular IPs. And I agree that other companies see the money being made and want a piece of that pie. I'm just glad that Capcom are seeing this huge success on the back of a quality product and not just "hunting" the same whales that the rest of the industry, including other Capcom games, seem to be after.
            Oh 100% and thank the lord (not even religious). They made the right decision in the end they put gamers first and shipped us a complete game in a time where that doesn't always happen anymore.
                I do think it's sad that this behaviour is commendable now. We just have to show our support for the instances when it does happen, to encourage this kind of behaviour.
    Idk how many. But i would have bought the game. Didnt cause of the reviews. 
And im 46 years old, not rich but no money problem and huge SW fan. 


8 million is not a success according to EA's standards. Forgot which article was that but I think it's forbes. You also have to consider that it's the most returned game when it was released in gamestop.
    It's different when you have a relatively unknown IPR in Monster Hunter in a western market compared to Star Wars which is massively popular worldwide.
        It is an it isn't. The reason why BF2 was unsuccessful and disappointing was not due to their total sales of the game but due to the fact they realized their 2-4 year plan was completely ruined and that their projections of money coming in for said years were completely wrong. Share holders don't like when you give them a number and the outcome is much lower.
            Without a doubt that holds true.

But then if they'd had a relatively unknown IP, or one with almost no track record in their target market, and under promised shareholders then over delivered with 8m in sales then they wouldn't have got their asses kicked by them. 
                Very true, MHW is a great success by any measure. Just kind of comparing apples to oranges with how their business models are set up differently. 
But BF2 was released way earlier than MHW. Comparing it that way BF2 sold much less. I bet that MHW will reach the 8 million much earlier than BF2 did.
    Id wager bF2 goes to EA access within a few months and then they will add the millions of folks that use that to the sales numbers.
I don't think it was sold. They stated shipped.  S bunch could be sitting at Walmart.
    From a publisher’s point of view, shipped = sold.  They got their money from the copies they’ve shipped, what the retailer does isn’t really their concern and doesn’t affect their bottom line.  That being said, retailers wouldn’t have ordered this many copies if they weren’t selling. 
        Capcom gave vague numbers though. They said 7.5 have been shipped, and "almost 7" players, so it seems to be between 6,8-7 actaully sold, which isn't that much of a difference to the shipped.
    Happy cake day.
>Idiots keep buying them, sadly.

People not hating something you hate does not make them idiots.

This is the problem with reddit.  You guys state an opinion and think that it makes it fact.  Its not.  Most folks dont give two shits about loot boxes.

I do, so I dont purchase those games.  But others do and thats fine.  If they want to spend more money to get a full game, that is on them.

    EA had a profit margin of only $50M in 2012 just before their Ultimate Team took off. They now have a profit margin of close to $1 billion USD and saw the stock rise 600% in 5 years. It costs them 40 cents on the dollar to make actual games, but only 20 cents on the dollar to sell MTX like lootboxes. In that time, they actually spend $300m LESS on game development now than they did in 2012 and sales of actual units is about the same. Their profit is quite literally entirely lootboxes.

Only 10% of their playerbase ever bought MTX. Yet we see Ultimate Team being where they spend the bulk of their development resources in the sports games, while other parts languish. We now see games like BF2 where the lootboxes are the central focus of the game. Most people *DON'T* give a shit about lootboxes, yet you now can't escape them. COD:WW2 you literally have a "daily quest" to watch people open lootboxes to entice you into being jealous. (Which drop onto Normandy beach, breaking immersion)

EA and Activision both have patents filed now for new "monetization schema" where they do advanced analytics on what you do, what items your mouse hovers over, how you play, etc. in order to push more MTX at you. They talk about changing how they matchmake you in multiplayer games to entice you to stay in the game and parade people with items you looked at in front of you.

The executives no longer let them make games and add skins on the side. They now have a thick manual labeled "Monetization Plan" slapped with a thud onto the table in front of them and told to design a "service" around it that supports said plan.
    I'm not disagreeing with the first portion of your statement, but that last sentence struck a chord with me. The general consensus is that loot boxes are bad. The only way someone wouldn't know that everybody else thinks loot boxes are bad is if they actively avoid reddit and gaming journalism. We need to be making a much bigger deal about it than is being made. Bad practices need to be punished.
        Except its just your opinion that they are bad.

The guy that works 80 hours a week and doesnt have hours a day to play probably appreciates them.
            I agree with the person that doesn't have time to"grind" paying to win. I don't think people care about that as much (there will always be haters). But the reason why lootboxes are so bad is because it's gambling. You are not guaranteed the item you want for the amount your pay. If said item was given for a set price then i think people wouldn't have this much hatred for it. Don't even get started on how kids are getting addicted to gambling at such a young age bc of lootboxes. 
                Why is gambling bad?

You are also blaming the developer because parents' aren't controlling what their kids are doing online.  
                    Just Google why gambling is bad and you'll see how such an addictive thing like gambling can really ruin your life. Especially when you get addicted to it at a young age. 

I don't recall me ever saying I blame the devs. But if you want to go down this road, I would say they are part of the problem. There are so many parties at fault here. The devs, EA, the parents, the law makers. etc etc. Especially the law makers for not keeping up with the times and tackling this issue at the butt. How quick were they to regulate and enforce laws for children when it came to gambling at casinos? Pretty quickly... And they need to get on this matter too. 
                        I dont need to google why gambling is bad.

You are basically arguing that people dont have free will and that the EA developers are magically forcing them to do things.  They arent.

And the lawmakers already have laws against kids gambling.  ANd if kids are gambling using their parents' credit cards, their parents should be fined.

Its not EAs job to make sure you arent a shitty a parent.
You always have borderlands 3 in the horizon. Borderlands 2 was a huge success cause it didnt had lootboxes
    Borderlands 2 came out on the cusp of the AAA lootbox age, shortly after ME3 introduced them. It did well because it was a good game. Not having Loot Boxes wasn't even a consideration at that point. 
        It's one of my favorite games.

I cannot wait for BL3.

If it comes out before Anthem I probably won't even give that game a try, if I'm being honest.

And they need to pay the devs and pay the huge marketing, so the profit is much smaller than what he said...
    Did MHW have lots of marketing?

They sell their games for 60$, but they get 25% in return. The retailer don't decide on the 60$. The game developers do. They just give a percentage of the 60$ to the retailer and the console manufacturer. 
I think lack of variety in monsters is more accurate. Everything is some type of T-Rex or dragon, barring the 2 fish. Would be dope to see things like giant insects or like just a straight up bad ass wolf or lion or something. 
    You mean Odogaron and Teostra? Literally a Wolf and a Lion
        I think Teostra looks more like a Manticore. (Without the scorpion tail obviously)
        Lol pretty much
        To be fair, I literally had no idea Odogaron was supposed to be a wolf and I've captured him 4 times now. 
        Vespoid Queen and Atoraru Ka would be two unique and fun additions. I wouldn't mind Ketcha Watcha and Blangonga/Congalala would be cool.
            That I agree. We need less predators. Vespoid/hornetaur kings, Congalala and the Hermitaur, I miss that crab.
                I am honestly surprised Vespoid Queen wasn't thrown in as a little hidden thing, like kill 20 Vespoids in a single hunt/expedition and she shows up all pissed off. Something in the same vein as hitting Cuccos in Zelda or trying to "farm" the cows in the Witcher 3 and then the Chort shows up and murders you.
        Last time I checked lions don’t burst into flames or fly and wolves don’t have giant fangs. 
            So you just want a normal Lion and a normal Wolf? LMAO obviously they need to change something if not this would be just a normal hunting game, not a fantasy one.
                Are you saying you don't enjoy hunting the deer in wildspire?
                Plus real life has a copyright on wolves and lions so they probably couldn't use them
    I think I understand what you mean.

Like how a lot of monsters are very similar to monsters from earlier areas,
    In a way, I believe that's why Trip included water zones and combat. There are only so many ways to choreograph terrestrial and flying monster combat. It wasn't everyone's cup of tea but id get pretty hyped to fight a Legiacrus. He was a terror in the water and a punching bag on land.
    I completely understand what you mean (you missed another specie, the Gerat Lizard one like Great Jagras, Great Girros and Dodogama) but I don't think that Uragaan and Radobaan fit your description too, do you think they are some sort of T-Rex???? (btw you meant to say Wyverns instes of Dragons... Dragons have 4 legs, Rathian, Rathalos, etc only have 2 legs, they are Wyverns).

That said I think Odogaron, Palomalu, Tobi-Kadashi, Kulu-Ya-Ku are very unique and don't fit your description at all...

Also I loved Legiana too.

My main complain are that there are many monsters that are the same but just with pallet swap, like Rathian, Rathalos, Pink Rathian and Azure Rathalos, they are all the same with different colours, that is fucking laziness..
        They have different AI and behaviours. And this pallet swap is a staple in the community for a lonh time already, they wouldn’t change it for the first *big* international release
I'm coming from 4u and while I know it's not fair to compare the two rosters, I meant that I hope a good amount of them are added through dlc throughout the games lifespan.
Look up Monster Hunter 4U's roster. Its ridiculous huge, especially if you include deviants
    Afaik the ultimate releases were expansions from the regular numeral releases. So world vs 4 is a better comparison here since world is still yet to have dlc, not world vs 4u. 

I mean, we don't have g Rank yet. More to come, yay!
        I would hesitate to compare World to a previous installment because we have yet to see this level of visual fidelity. It must take a  significant amount of time to create a new monster compared to other titles of the series. I absolutely want and expect more monsters to come, but temper that expectation based on the quality of content.

One thing, however, is that Kirin and Kuala have an uncanny resemblance to their respective predecessors. I don't think I've noted any new animations or significant changes to the models/textures. The rest of the roster, by comparison, is an obvious upgrade at the very least.
             Kirin now casts a shadow. 
            Fidelity wise the game looks nicer than the previous titles but honestly there's not much crazy going on here that would warrant any concern from a consumer or development perspective. 

Definitely keeping my expectations realistic, however, knowing how game dev and general product management works with being in both game/web dev vs what I've seen in world I would wager that there's a handful of monsters that the dev team can gleam off of to start with and hopefully the capability to modularize behavior. 

I'm excited for more and right now I'm loving what I've got. I'll continue to pay for this model over the handheld.
    Right, but they had to completely rework the game for world. It wouldn't be possible for them to sustain that amount on their first go.
Rathian, Rathalos, Pink Rathian, Azure Rathalos, only here it is the same Monster in 4 different pallets...
     Rathian and Rathalos are very different. Similar but different. 
And Yakusa O! 
DLC yes but they will sell an Ultimate Version or something like that for sure just like they did before.
     As much as I like the game, buying 2 copies just to get additional content and difficulty is a big no no for me. They should definitely make the Ultimate a paid expansion this time. 
        Agree 100%
            I think that's what they'll do since western audiences aren't as used to this marketing scheme. 
Yes it will be and always has been 
Ok thanks.
Come on guy. Let’s keep this a friendly sub. 
Good news is all the xp you gain will not disappear. It’s simply hidden. So as you finally progress through main story your level is gonna skyrocket 
    Is there XP? I don't know how hunter ranks work. I just assumed it arbitrarily went up as you did story missions but I've been going back and helping my friend with his since he got a late start so I'm still only rank 4 and starting the coral area expedition.
        Yes there is but you’re right in thinking your rank only goes up when doing story (for now) after you finish the main story your “cap” is lifted and all the xp you’ve been gaining gets added. If you really have been playing a lot you will probably hit the first cap immediately when beating the final boss 
Im about 75 hours in at HR 14, not waiting for anyone but looking for these friggin' foot prints is killing me...

Took me like 4 hours to find the pink rathian trail, another 4 hours for nergigante and now i have to look for the elder dragon trail (and we know how many of them there are....) fml, other than that im loving it.
    I personnally didnt have any trouble with those tracks, the quests were done by the time I received the quest, except for Rotting Vale. 

If you spot them once, just focus on hunting something, and come back either later or after a quest at the exact same spot, and you'll gather another easy 2, then repeat a hunt or reload a new expedition.

I find that everything comes to fruitition in this game when you dont focus on the task at end, like when chasing for gems or special drops. Just have fun while giving it 5% of your brain's attention and  it will pop everytime.
    Once you find where the tracks are, just end the mission and launch an expedition back to the same spot. I did that for the elder dragon one and got all the prints in 4 expedition, so like 20 minutes.
Yep, I imported it and am struggling through using Google translate. It's not going well lol
Hey I still need my elders if you're bored lol
    Lol i would as i have today off, but unfortunately i still don't have Internet from that huge wind storm. I'll reply to you when i do though and we can knock 'em out of you're on xbox
        Are you in Eastern MA?  They got wrecked.  Since I'm in Western MA, we haven't heard much of any other area due to the Cape getting steamrolled.
            Nah I'm near the DC area. 
                How bad did you guys get it?
                    My area had 330,000 homes without power for at least a day. My street had two transformers that were split in half and 6 areas where trees were piled up on the lines. I haven't heard of any casualties, fortunately. 

How about you? 


                        I live in that area, too, in southern MD! My area didn't get hit too hard fortunately, but this makes 4 weeks in a row that I haven't been to my English class because of freak circumstances.
                NOVA? Those winds were nutssss
                    Yeah one of my neighbors had all 6 trees in his front yard fall down. Luckily none of them hit his house but it took us a while day to get it cleaned up. I don't think nova/sova power companies were ready for the magnitude of this as i heard they had to get workers all the way from Kentucky to help out with the volume. Hats off to those guys. 
Ya its literally the title. 
I'm in the middle of making all the weapons and killing all the monsters with all the weapons. 
If you like melee, you should give Switch Axe a try soon. It has a bit less mobility than Hammer, but it has a much longer reach, is easy to time attacks to actually hit (unlike the Greatsword), and doesn't require any fancy moves to be at optimal damage like the Longsword. I consider it the best balance of damage, ease of use/ease of landing attacks out of the melee weapons.
Since you are new to Monster Hunter, I asssume you have not heard of G rank which many consider to be the endgame of previous Monster Hunter games which could be implemented in World sooner or later. 
    I heard about it a couple of times, it's supposedly a more extreme version of what high rank is to normal. But in the end isn't that just more and harder monsters? MH isn't really an mmo, so either way you run out of stuff to do sooner or later. Not that this is a gripe for me though, the game is brilliant.
        In other monster hunter games, G rank had several levels to it, and they were all brutal. I got to the lowest level of G rank before a Pink Rathian made me quit the game for a while, and I never really got around to beating it.
I agree.  There is a lot to do to get the platinum!
Ive never gotten a platinum. Ever. Not even Witcher 3 and Persona 5, which are my favourite games of all time 
    Some games are easier to get than others, but this game to me seems very feasible if you're willing to invest the time and put in the work. I probably won't get it since this is my first MH game and I'm happily progressing at a snails pace, currently HR 12 at 42 hours. But I can see myself sticking with this game for awhile, so I figured it would be a good end game for me.
        You think 42 hours is a snail's pace? I'm at over 100 and in terms of quests completed, I'm not even that far ahead of you. MH has so much content though, I spend so much time just making gear that I take forever to progress.
Man, I hope we can use the same account on PC as we do on consoles. But after playing this game for quite awhile and scratching my head at Capcom's extremely terrible online controls, I remain very doubtful that could happen.
What rumors? I demand to know more!
    A certain monster..
        Devil Joh? I knew he was coming in march, but never knew if there was a confirmed date. Is the rumor that he is coming this friday?
            Yeah just the rumor I think. No official confirmation.
            Well, besides the already confirmed Jho monster. I've heard they may release other monsters alongside him as well. 

These are just rumors though. I really hope they release batches of monsters rather than just one every so often but we'll have to see. 
                Yeah i was thinking about this the other day, we can only hope and wait.
            Well looking at the upcoming quest...

Title: A Simple Task (9*/Ancient Forest/HR30+)

Deliver 10 Gourmet shrooms

??? xD
                Oh shit! That's definitively Jho, or Capcom trolling us big time.
How many hours do you have so far? I'm 100 hours and still HR 29
    186hours. 
    202 as of today
I know what you are saying but you can't deny that even EA has made more money off of BF2 than Capcom will make off of Monster Hunter. Let's go one further GTA: Online making more money than that and Call of Duty probably banking the most. Companies see that there is merit into pissing fans off because of the other fans who still buy loot boxes and other nonsense. I would be shocked if the public outcry for no more loot boxes changes much, when in the end they see they can make money for MANY MANY years after launch vs. making it all up front and nothing later. Is it shitty for us consumers who HATE them, yup 100% it is. 
    Maybe, maybe not. They have to pay for the license, im wrong? 
    I 100% agree with you that EA made a fuckton off the Star Wars license, and the other games you mentioned are also incredibly popular IPs. And I agree that other companies see the money being made and want a piece of that pie. I'm just glad that Capcom are seeing this huge success on the back of a quality product and not just "hunting" the same whales that the rest of the industry, including other Capcom games, seem to be after.
        Oh 100% and thank the lord (not even religious). They made the right decision in the end they put gamers first and shipped us a complete game in a time where that doesn't always happen anymore.
            I do think it's sad that this behaviour is commendable now. We just have to show our support for the instances when it does happen, to encourage this kind of behaviour.
Idk how many. But i would have bought the game. Didnt cause of the reviews. 
And im 46 years old, not rich but no money problem and huge SW fan. 


It's different when you have a relatively unknown IPR in Monster Hunter in a western market compared to Star Wars which is massively popular worldwide.
    It is an it isn't. The reason why BF2 was unsuccessful and disappointing was not due to their total sales of the game but due to the fact they realized their 2-4 year plan was completely ruined and that their projections of money coming in for said years were completely wrong. Share holders don't like when you give them a number and the outcome is much lower.
        Without a doubt that holds true.

But then if they'd had a relatively unknown IP, or one with almost no track record in their target market, and under promised shareholders then over delivered with 8m in sales then they wouldn't have got their asses kicked by them. 
            Very true, MHW is a great success by any measure. Just kind of comparing apples to oranges with how their business models are set up differently. 
Id wager bF2 goes to EA access within a few months and then they will add the millions of folks that use that to the sales numbers.
From a publisher’s point of view, shipped = sold.  They got their money from the copies they’ve shipped, what the retailer does isn’t really their concern and doesn’t affect their bottom line.  That being said, retailers wouldn’t have ordered this many copies if they weren’t selling. 
    Capcom gave vague numbers though. They said 7.5 have been shipped, and "almost 7" players, so it seems to be between 6,8-7 actaully sold, which isn't that much of a difference to the shipped.
Happy cake day.
EA had a profit margin of only $50M in 2012 just before their Ultimate Team took off. They now have a profit margin of close to $1 billion USD and saw the stock rise 600% in 5 years. It costs them 40 cents on the dollar to make actual games, but only 20 cents on the dollar to sell MTX like lootboxes. In that time, they actually spend $300m LESS on game development now than they did in 2012 and sales of actual units is about the same. Their profit is quite literally entirely lootboxes.

Only 10% of their playerbase ever bought MTX. Yet we see Ultimate Team being where they spend the bulk of their development resources in the sports games, while other parts languish. We now see games like BF2 where the lootboxes are the central focus of the game. Most people *DON'T* give a shit about lootboxes, yet you now can't escape them. COD:WW2 you literally have a "daily quest" to watch people open lootboxes to entice you into being jealous. (Which drop onto Normandy beach, breaking immersion)

EA and Activision both have patents filed now for new "monetization schema" where they do advanced analytics on what you do, what items your mouse hovers over, how you play, etc. in order to push more MTX at you. They talk about changing how they matchmake you in multiplayer games to entice you to stay in the game and parade people with items you looked at in front of you.

The executives no longer let them make games and add skins on the side. They now have a thick manual labeled "Monetization Plan" slapped with a thud onto the table in front of them and told to design a "service" around it that supports said plan.
I'm not disagreeing with the first portion of your statement, but that last sentence struck a chord with me. The general consensus is that loot boxes are bad. The only way someone wouldn't know that everybody else thinks loot boxes are bad is if they actively avoid reddit and gaming journalism. We need to be making a much bigger deal about it than is being made. Bad practices need to be punished.
    Except its just your opinion that they are bad.

The guy that works 80 hours a week and doesnt have hours a day to play probably appreciates them.
        I agree with the person that doesn't have time to"grind" paying to win. I don't think people care about that as much (there will always be haters). But the reason why lootboxes are so bad is because it's gambling. You are not guaranteed the item you want for the amount your pay. If said item was given for a set price then i think people wouldn't have this much hatred for it. Don't even get started on how kids are getting addicted to gambling at such a young age bc of lootboxes. 
            Why is gambling bad?

You are also blaming the developer because parents' aren't controlling what their kids are doing online.  
                Just Google why gambling is bad and you'll see how such an addictive thing like gambling can really ruin your life. Especially when you get addicted to it at a young age. 

I don't recall me ever saying I blame the devs. But if you want to go down this road, I would say they are part of the problem. There are so many parties at fault here. The devs, EA, the parents, the law makers. etc etc. Especially the law makers for not keeping up with the times and tackling this issue at the butt. How quick were they to regulate and enforce laws for children when it came to gambling at casinos? Pretty quickly... And they need to get on this matter too. 
                    I dont need to google why gambling is bad.

You are basically arguing that people dont have free will and that the EA developers are magically forcing them to do things.  They arent.

And the lawmakers already have laws against kids gambling.  ANd if kids are gambling using their parents' credit cards, their parents should be fined.

Its not EAs job to make sure you arent a shitty a parent.
Borderlands 2 came out on the cusp of the AAA lootbox age, shortly after ME3 introduced them. It did well because it was a good game. Not having Loot Boxes wasn't even a consideration at that point. 
    It's one of my favorite games.

I cannot wait for BL3.

If it comes out before Anthem I probably won't even give that game a try, if I'm being honest.
Did MHW have lots of marketing?


    In Japan? Yes
        Ah, yeah.  This is worldwide sales.  I somehow missed that on my first read-through.

Share holders don't like when you give them a number and the outcome is much lower.
    Without a doubt that holds true.

But then if they'd had a relatively unknown IP, or one with almost no track record in their target market, and under promised shareholders then over delivered with 8m in sales then they wouldn't have got their asses kicked by them. 
        Very true, MHW is a great success by any measure. Just kind of comparing apples to oranges with how their business models are set up differently. 
Capcom gave vague numbers though. They said 7.5 have been shipped, and "almost 7" players, so it seems to be between 6,8-7 actaully sold, which isn't that much of a difference to the shipped.
Except its just your opinion that they are bad.

The guy that works 80 hours a week and doesnt have hours a day to play probably appreciates them.
    I agree with the person that doesn't have time to"grind" paying to win. I don't think people care about that as much (there will always be haters). But the reason why lootboxes are so bad is because it's gambling. You are not guaranteed the item you want for the amount your pay. If said item was given for a set price then i think people wouldn't have this much hatred for it. Don't even get started on how kids are getting addicted to gambling at such a young age bc of lootboxes. 
        Why is gambling bad?

You are also blaming the developer because parents' aren't controlling what their kids are doing online.  
            Just Google why gambling is bad and you'll see how such an addictive thing like gambling can really ruin your life. Especially when you get addicted to it at a young age. 

I don't recall me ever saying I blame the devs. But if you want to go down this road, I would say they are part of the problem. There are so many parties at fault here. The devs, EA, the parents, the law makers. etc etc. Especially the law makers for not keeping up with the times and tackling this issue at the butt. How quick were they to regulate and enforce laws for children when it came to gambling at casinos? Pretty quickly... And they need to get on this matter too. 
                I dont need to google why gambling is bad.

You are basically arguing that people dont have free will and that the EA developers are magically forcing them to do things.  They arent.

And the lawmakers already have laws against kids gambling.  ANd if kids are gambling using their parents' credit cards, their parents should be fined.

Its not EAs job to make sure you arent a shitty a parent.
It's one of my favorite games.

I cannot wait for BL3.

If it comes out before Anthem I probably won't even give that game a try, if I'm being honest.
In Japan? Yes
    Ah, yeah.  This is worldwide sales.  I somehow missed that on my first read-through.


I think Teostra looks more like a Manticore. (Without the scorpion tail obviously)
Lol pretty much
To be fair, I literally had no idea Odogaron was supposed to be a wolf and I've captured him 4 times now. 
Vespoid Queen and Atoraru Ka would be two unique and fun additions. I wouldn't mind Ketcha Watcha and Blangonga/Congalala would be cool.
    That I agree. We need less predators. Vespoid/hornetaur kings, Congalala and the Hermitaur, I miss that crab.
        I am honestly surprised Vespoid Queen wasn't thrown in as a little hidden thing, like kill 20 Vespoids in a single hunt/expedition and she shows up all pissed off. Something in the same vein as hitting Cuccos in Zelda or trying to "farm" the cows in the Witcher 3 and then the Chort shows up and murders you.
Last time I checked lions don’t burst into flames or fly and wolves don’t have giant fangs. 
    So you just want a normal Lion and a normal Wolf? LMAO obviously they need to change something if not this would be just a normal hunting game, not a fantasy one.
        Are you saying you don't enjoy hunting the deer in wildspire?
        Plus real life has a copyright on wolves and lions so they probably couldn't use them
They have different AI and behaviours. And this pallet swap is a staple in the community for a lonh time already, they wouldn’t change it for the first *big* international release
I would hesitate to compare World to a previous installment because we have yet to see this level of visual fidelity. It must take a  significant amount of time to create a new monster compared to other titles of the series. I absolutely want and expect more monsters to come, but temper that expectation based on the quality of content.

One thing, however, is that Kirin and Kuala have an uncanny resemblance to their respective predecessors. I don't think I've noted any new animations or significant changes to the models/textures. The rest of the roster, by comparison, is an obvious upgrade at the very least.
     Kirin now casts a shadow. 
    Fidelity wise the game looks nicer than the previous titles but honestly there's not much crazy going on here that would warrant any concern from a consumer or development perspective. 

Definitely keeping my expectations realistic, however, knowing how game dev and general product management works with being in both game/web dev vs what I've seen in world I would wager that there's a handful of monsters that the dev team can gleam off of to start with and hopefully the capability to modularize behavior. 

I'm excited for more and right now I'm loving what I've got. I'll continue to pay for this model over the handheld.
Agree 100%
    I think that's what they'll do since western audiences aren't as used to this marketing scheme. 
Yes there is but you’re right in thinking your rank only goes up when doing story (for now) after you finish the main story your “cap” is lifted and all the xp you’ve been gaining gets added. If you really have been playing a lot you will probably hit the first cap immediately when beating the final boss 
Are you in Eastern MA?  They got wrecked.  Since I'm in Western MA, we haven't heard much of any other area due to the Cape getting steamrolled.
    Nah I'm near the DC area. 
        How bad did you guys get it?
            My area had 330,000 homes without power for at least a day. My street had two transformers that were split in half and 6 areas where trees were piled up on the lines. I haven't heard of any casualties, fortunately. 

How about you? 


                I live in that area, too, in southern MD! My area didn't get hit too hard fortunately, but this makes 4 weeks in a row that I haven't been to my English class because of freak circumstances.
        NOVA? Those winds were nutssss
            Yeah one of my neighbors had all 6 trees in his front yard fall down. Luckily none of them hit his house but it took us a while day to get it cleaned up. I don't think nova/sova power companies were ready for the magnitude of this as i heard they had to get workers all the way from Kentucky to help out with the volume. Hats off to those guys. 
In other monster hunter games, G rank had several levels to it, and they were all brutal. I got to the lowest level of G rank before a Pink Rathian made me quit the game for a while, and I never really got around to beating it.
You think 42 hours is a snail's pace? I'm at over 100 and in terms of quests completed, I'm not even that far ahead of you. MH has so much content though, I spend so much time just making gear that I take forever to progress.
Devil Joh? I knew he was coming in march, but never knew if there was a confirmed date. Is the rumor that he is coming this friday?
    Yeah just the rumor I think. No official confirmation.
    Well, besides the already confirmed Jho monster. I've heard they may release other monsters alongside him as well. 

These are just rumors though. I really hope they release batches of monsters rather than just one every so often but we'll have to see. 
        Yeah i was thinking about this the other day, we can only hope and wait.
    Well looking at the upcoming quest...

Title: A Simple Task (9*/Ancient Forest/HR30+)

Deliver 10 Gourmet shrooms

??? xD
        Oh shit! That's definitively Jho, or Capcom trolling us big time.
Oh 100% and thank the lord (not even religious). They made the right decision in the end they put gamers first and shipped us a complete game in a time where that doesn't always happen anymore.
    I do think it's sad that this behaviour is commendable now. We just have to show our support for the instances when it does happen, to encourage this kind of behaviour.
Without a doubt that holds true.

But then if they'd had a relatively unknown IP, or one with almost no track record in their target market, and under promised shareholders then over delivered with 8m in sales then they wouldn't have got their asses kicked by them.
