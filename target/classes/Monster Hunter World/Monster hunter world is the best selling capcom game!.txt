[[Monster hunter world is the best selling capcom game!]]





Theyve announced this along time ago. It shattered records for capcom. And continues too.
    I mean, what other capcom games have come out that could really compete?

            Source?

^^/s  ^^of ^^course
            I meant in recent sales.
                Street Fighter II Turbo?
                    SUPER Street Fighter II?
                        Street Fighter II and Knuckles?
                            Featuring Dante from the Devil May Cry Series?
                                Game of the year edition?
                                    The Definitive Edition
                                    Directorâ€™s cut?
                                Wait why are we talking about MHW again?
        Resident Evil 4? Maybe
            I meant in recent sales.
                Ohh maybe RE2 remake
                The RE4 remake might.

...they better not mess that up.
                    Like they did for 3. Capcom was on a roll until that remake.
                        I think it was good just criminally short. As short as the original but without the replay ability
                        I enjoyed it for what it is. I wish they had diverted money from the multiplayer mode to the singleplayer game, though, or even to a straight-up mercenaries mode.
        The new RE Remales are both fuckin awesome games and so is the new DMC. i guess the only thing those games have shorter play times.
        Dragons Dogma 2
            We can only wish
                Good news, dd2 is coming ðŸ™Œ
    Wasn't that announcement that it was their fastest selling game?
        [deleted]
            How can it be 17 million in the first week and then 15,7 million total in the image posted?
            17 million copies sold? I'm not sure how they track money earnings but wouldn't that mean the game made over a billion dollars in its first week?
    Because it's the first one to be on xbox
And just think. One day there will be another new monster hunter game
    I hope so
        Itâ€™s almost a guarantee but I wonder where that one will go or if theyâ€™ll continue to expand on the new world and everything in it. Hell I wonder if they are already starting to work on the next title.
            Maybe old world + new world maps with a ton of monsters old and new. It is a long stretch but a cool one.
                I could get behind that having old and new I wonder if theyâ€™ll reintroduce old mechanics like water combat and the like and they have potential to add to worlds map and add swamp lands that are less trees and still have some verticality but itâ€™s underneath the water not above they could make underwater with cave systems that you can on dry land again and the like
                    That is a good Idea.
                        Thank you! You could create a whole environment with water based monsters you could have crabs and sea serpents you could even create new fish type monsters as well and on the surface of the swamp land you can still have monsters who thrive in wetland or marshy environment it could open possibilities for movement or restrictions of movement and even new blight mechanics.
                            do you really want Plessy back?


like, really?


*gets hipchecked from miles away*
                                Well hopefully theyâ€™d fix the hit boxes and I mean pickles hipcheck has some bullshit as well
                                    i rarely fought Jho myself, but Plessy gave me nightmares. i remember almost throwing my PSP due to them hips...
            MRW VR for the Oculus Quest.  

One can only dream of playing IG in VR and vomiting everywhere.
                Just put out a tarp before you play less clean up that way
                    In all seriousness I would love a Monster Hunting VR game, clearly it could not be what MH is, with the flashing spinny anime finisher moves that it has and would have to be a totally different feel/game but the core gameplay of fighting massive monsters in VR and crafting gear and fighting other massive monsters, would be awesome.
                        I want to be a monster in VR so I can live out my pickle fantasies
                            You joke, but what if it was a game where you were monsters, hunting the hunters?  And if you're deviljho, rajang or nergigante, hunting other monsters?
                                That was not a joke. I really do have pickle fantasies
                                    You're Pickle Riiiiiick!
                Or pulling off the hammer somersault and the dual blade spin on the back.
            So I saw the other day that the Monster Hunter Franchise is managed by two studios (studio Alpha and Beta) and Alpha alone have done World + Iceborne and we haven't heard anything from Beta studio in a while, so likely they are hard at work on something else.

EDIT: We've also been told that Iceborne will be the last expansion of the World series.
                So we could see a new hand held then or they are getting a jump on next console version
                Last expansion? Isn't it the only expansion?
                    It is
                Iâ€™m just hoping we get another game based on world cause they have so much they can work with and I hope they expand on the new world and we can bring our characters along with it
                there is also the weirdos from frontier team
            Tbh I think we could see a real open world monster hunter game at some point, with the new consoles having just a massive step up in terms of power, and some of the clearly successful aspects of MHW. I could see them really putting an emphasis with the single world idea and maximizing that potential.
                Iâ€™m curious as to when the next one might come out
            >  Hell I wonder if they are already starting to work on the next title. 

I'd imagine so, but no one knows at what stage it's at right now obviously.

I'm just curious as to whether they'll continue producing "classic" MH on Switch alongside a sequel to World.
                Iâ€™m assuming theyâ€™ll do another sequel to world it was successful I donâ€™t see why they wouldnâ€™t do it or possibly but it at the top of the to do list
            Full Open-World and i am sold.
btw MHW is my first MH game so i donâ€™t know if that sound good for the Veteran hunters or not.
        With the way that World has become their best selling game and as far as I've seen, has overwhelmingly good reviews, I have no doubt that they are going to make another MH game and that will probably sell like hotcakes.
Cant wait for MHW Iceborne Ultimate 2
    MHW Iceborne Ultimate 2: Championship Edition EX
        With Turbo.
            Hyper Turbo HD Addition Edition.
    MHW Iceborne 2: Electric Boogaloo
    Tri*
    Wouldnâ€™t mind it actually ðŸ˜‚
    Imagine Capcom announcing a new Monster Hunter game and it's Monster Hunter Riders 2.
    But if they announce MHW Legends 3, I'm not biting.

I fell for that shit once.
This makes me so happy to see. After being fucked in the ass by video game companies like Koei Tecmo and Bandai Namco, itâ€™s so refreshing to see a game like World receive the reception it deserves. 

The developers work their fucking asses off for this game and have been pumping out free updates like itâ€™s nobodyâ€™s business. 

Kudos to Capcom for this fantastic game. As a monster hunter who started in World, you have a new loyal fan in me. Iâ€™m excited to see what comes next .
    Anyone who started with world/iceborn without playing any of the previous titles is equally valid as a fan of this great series and I'm so happy to have more people sharing this amazing experience, the creators put in tons of work and came a long way (especially in the quality of life department) to make this game accessible for new players and it defiantly shows.
        I played MH4U, then MH3U, then GenU, then World. The leap from something like 3U to World is astronomical. I hope they take what they learned from World and add a lot of extra things like swimming and tracking.
            I feel like having a full controller may also be a big factor in making the incorporation of swimming and underwater combat easier, I loved 3U and 4U on the 3DS but I don't think I will ever miss having my right analog be on the touchscreen.
                I had in on the Wii U lmao, my friend got one for family and got the game too but wasn't able to play it well. Swimming will be probably better if it comes back. Be faster, more responsive, etc.
        I started in World, but I like MHGU better. I like the cartoonish weapon and armor designs, and the hunter arts and ability to play as a palico are amazing. In addition the sheer number and variety of monsters is incredible. I wish I had gotten mh3u before my wii u broke.
            If they could take the visual design sense of the old games and cram it on top of the MHW base, I would be a happy camper.
            I am playing through GenU now because of having played through MWH:I. I can't say I like one other better as they both have their obvious differences. I will say however that they are both super fun, and I'm glad World made me get GenU for my Switch.
        That's what I did. I had no idea that there was a Monster Hunter series of games. I didn't even know about World until my friend said he was hyped to get it. I looked it up and it looked cool, but I wasn't super hyped on it. I was wrong. I picked it up and put around 350+ hours into it and then about the same amount of hours into Iceborne. Looking on Steam, I have 736 total hours. I only stopped playing it because Phantasy Star came out. It really is an amazing game and I can say for certain that I WILL get the next Monster Hunter game that comes out.
    I sat through both World and Iceborne's endgame credits, for this exact reason xD I realised there were like hundreds of studios involved in this one game
    Same. I've started playing World about a month ago and I'm completely hooked. Huge fan.
        Hey man! As a veteran I just want to wish you a warm welcome! Glad to see new blood in our midst!
            Thank you very much! :)
        I tried really hard to get my husband into MH with 4U, but it just couldn't click with him. He bought MHW for me for a birthday present, and then IB for my birthday the next year, and has managed to be so hooked that he's put twice as many hours in as I have.

This game is apparently the fan-maker.
    Not to mention probably the best paid DLC of all time. Honestly, Iâ€™d say Iceborne even beats The Ringed City and the Old Hunters DLC from DS3 and BB, and those are generally considered masterpiece DLCs, and two of my personal favorite, as well.
        Indeed, the teams working on monster hunter usually follow the trend of:
Release base game, add a ton of free updates and content, including events

Then after a year or so, the release a new game in the same generation. The expansion adds a new rank (g rank or master rank) l, a ton of new monsters, and some gameplay tweaks. 
In older games it would be called an ultimate version. So from monster hunter 3 to monster 3 ultimate would be the equivalent of going from world to iceborne.
            Ahhhh gotcha, this is actually my first MH, so that makes a lot of sense
    The sheer amount of efford that was clearly put into making the monsters behave like actual wildlife is amazing. I'm glad the game is doing so well.
        Not to mention all the little things, like the idle animations for the palico chefs, and the the fully orchestrated unique songs for all the new free content monsters.

You can tell it really is a labor of love, where the ones working on the game actually adore the game and put in far more than just what is required.
    Mhw is my first MH game and it's been absolutely amazing.  One of my favorite games ever.  
I'm usually pretty against DLC unless I can get it on sale, but in January I got the base game for $10 and Iceborne for $40 (pan bundle for $50 for both).  I was happy with the base game but I thought I was getting ripped off with the DLC.  
Holy shit I couldn't have been more wrong.  Iceborne is like an entirely new game, with arguably more content in it than the base game had, and they just keep adding in more for free.  

Seriously so awesome!
Dragon's Dogma 2 *someday*

*I still believe*

Edit: It's apparently in production now or something. That was the happiest gaming read in awhile.
No surprises that re5 is so high, but I thought re6 got a pretty bad rep? Interesting to see it up there
    Bad rep doesnt mean bad selling. Im one of the odd ones who thought 6 was decent. Not good mind you, just entertaining enough to not hate it. But im 33 and grew up playing all the old school resident evils so more RE is good for me.
        Oh 6 is more than decent, itâ€™s a very rich and highly polished game. people talked shit about it but at the end of the day they still had fun with it
            Game was extremely polished, agreed. The converging stories and updated situations of older characters was great as well. Actually, yeah, I dare say it was a damn good game.
                I wish I was able to play that version of RE6
            Half of the game is decent. And i'm not saying incredible, but just decent. The other half is a pile of horseshit. Specially the gunfight parts with Chris Redfield or the stupidly annoying levels with two El Gigantes we have to play twice.
        I played RE6 to death with my wife, it was just a perfect fit her.  
Its hard to get her into gaming, but she loved that game and we did like 10 playthroughs of every team
            Thats just awesome. My girl is not a gamer either but she did love Portal 2 and we played the hell out of the Co Op mode.
        RE6 had a good mercenaries mode, and Sherry's campaign was actually interesting
    It sold well because RE5 sold well, RE6 is part of the reason RE7 didn't sell better, despite being a much better game.

A games quality and reception often influence the next in the series.
    sales don't reflect a game's quality
    What's ironic is that Capcom planned for RE6 to sell way more, so it's not considered a success, at least not in Capcom's eyes.
    Pokemon Sword and Shield is one of the best-selling Pokemon games in the franchise, despite Gamersâ„¢ bitching about how bad it is since its first announcement. Reception =/= Sales.
Shame to see dragon's dogma isn't that high, it was a great game with some unique features
    Dragons Dogma 2 will come brother. Hail to Grigori
        We can but dream. The class mixing and matching was great. The fashion potential was out there.
        One of the best game I ever played.
    Pretty much introduced mounting for MH4.
        The mounting was what made it. I've never seen anything else that lets you physically crawl up a Cyclops legs, back and face just to mash his eye in before flipping down and destroying some goblins
            Shadow of the Colossus maybe?
    Only problem is it aged terribly.

I had fond memories of that game and recently reinstalled it. It took about five minutes of gameplay to realize that it was just straight up MHW gameplay... but far *far* worse and dumbed down.
    Or any Devil May Crys. I'm gonna cry ;_;
it only took them near a decade to come to ps4 xbox + pc lol. Don't think they regret not being exclusive.
    Well technically they released a Monster Hunter on the PS2. And I believe it took over a decade for them to come back
well deserved, ongoing grind, interesting world, challenging enemies, reasonable learning curves, never ending events, friendly community.
    >ongoing grind

Thatâ€™s what makes this game unbearable to play.
The game is one of the top 10 most played in steam too. Last time I saw it tho I don't know if it change now.
    IB has been in top sellers ever since it came out. Always the 1st after promotions too.
        Yep I am glad I found this game when Iceborne release. To be fair I feel like Iceborne completed the game.
            I started playing just a month ago, and in all honesty while playing the MHW part, while knowing that IB and master rank existed, the "end-game" vibe of the high rank was kinda killed. One thing i disliked is that i played the whole MHW campaign and only then bought the expansion, which had major changes for some weapons and the clutch claw. Given that there's no additional download needed for IB, I cant understand why they didnt implement these changes in the base game too.
                Well yeah, the game is good but far from perfect. Maybe because of budget issues or something? Since I don't know what's going on there I just love the game.
Maybe it will make Capcom actually release other Monster Hunter titles on PC.  


I would love to try playing with MHGU weapon arts and stuff.
    Hopefully they add crossplay or cross-saves in the future could really benefit this game.
    PC only contributed to a couple million of those sales, it wouldn't be enough on its own.
        It was like... 4,5m copies as of march 2019 though.   
It's almost one third of those sales, so I'd say it's a lot.
            World sold more than that in 3 days of launch.

It went from 8.3 million just before PC launch to 10 million after it launched.

In fact, in Asia alone PS4 World had sold 4 million copies.

Either way, PS4 was the heavy hitter.
                Even if PS4 sold more, still almost one third of 15m last year is a good record. I don't know why you have an urge to tell me that PS4 sold more, but ok.
                    I don't, but PC sales are nothing more than "we should keep porting later" numbers.

They are not the numbers for developing explicitly for PC.
                        ...Are you dumb?

I just said in my first post that I hope, because of those numbers, they will put more games on PC and you just said those numbers don't mean anything other that they will put other games on PC.
                            Rude.

How exactly does someone decide whether you meant PC exclusives or ports?
                                You know PC content is caught up to consoles now right? You can stop with your ps4 hard-on. We get it ps4 sold more.
                                    What does that have to do with literally anything?

Also the joke's on you, I don't even have the PS4 version, I use the version that sold a tiny portion, even next to PC.
                                Idk...by reading his original post and using the context of, "I would love to try playing with MHGU weapon arts and stuff," to come to the obvious conclusion that he's referring to ports for PC...
                                    The "obvious conclusion" is Capcom aren't going to release a mediocre-looking game on PC after World and so they mean new games.
                                With the fact I said I want to try out the MHGU I'd say it's pretty easy.   
Also the fact that I never said anything about exclusives, just PC releases. A PC release doesn't have to be exclusive.
                                    If you want to try out MHGU then you get a switch. You don't expect people to think you want a 3DS game ported to PC.

You never said anything about ports either. PC release is either or.
Monster Hunter World/Iceborne is ***EASILY*** in contention for my favorite game of all time, if not just taking the cake altogether, despite the flaws it has.

The gameplay is solid, the graphics are great, the world itself is absolutely amazing, everything is polished, and most importantly, Capcom doesn't employ any predatory bullshit to get at our wallets. This game is a prime example that, when done correctly, quality equals cash, and you can keep the respect of your player base to boot!

I can't wait to see where the game goes after Alatreon, and I can't wait to see what they do with the next game.
Tri being the second most sold of the franchise, no wonder, that game is simply incredible
    I dunno where that list creator got those numbers from but 3U sold 2.6M, Tri is 1.9M. They're among the least selling individual MH titles ever. Maybe they combined it with Portable 3rd/Freedom 3, the second best selling individual MH title? Which is literally a whole different game altogether from 3 and 3U lol 
http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/finance/million.html

What a weird graph lol
        Yeah, Freedom 3 shouldn't be clumped in with 3/3U. Different village, less maps, and less monsters. MH4/4U definitely would take the 2nd top selling after World/IB, which I believe is the superior game compared to 3/3U.
        Wasn't portable 3rd the place Holder for tri on the psp and PS3? Thought I Read that somewhere so could be the reason why they clumped together.
        "monster hunter freedom 3", yeah, lets split salt to the open western world wound -_-
    It had the benefit of being on Wii too, which sold phenomenally well.
Hasn't it been their best selling game for a while now?  Like, I remember them saying this a LONG time ago.
    Yeah, since it came out.
Thanks God, the best franchise I've ever played
Seriously, go look at Capcom stock from around the time MHW released. I really wish I invested.
I wonder how much of it is double buying from console to PC.
    Doesn't really matter tbh, considering SF2 is only so high due to their multiple versions and arcades having to buy new cabinets to stay up-to-date. Oh, and I'm sure they include even mobile ports into that number, including GameBoy SF2.
        I like how I'm curious about how many of the community bought the game multiple times and you're over here telling me my personal intrigue doesn't matter and rambling about Street Fighter.
Wasnâ€™t that the case for quite a while now or was that sales in cash and not numbers
    Games aren't measured in cash like movies.

They're measured by how many units are dispatched to stores.
        I know that was just confused bc I previously read that mhw is the most sold game capcom ever had but according to this statistic thatâ€™d be false
            It's still true though.
                Yeah but that was half a year ago and by this statistic half a year ago mhw was not the best selling capcom game of all time so i was just confused
Not suprising, considering the fact that Monster Hunter was already one of those RPGs that was heavily associated with the Japanese in gaming. Heck, there's even a lot of MH cameos in popular media entertainment like in anime. Also the fact that Capcom promised us 2 years of content for MHW after release (with 2020 being the final year, sadly) and they've been doing an excellent job.
    The anime Haganai has them playing a game together as group activity and it is basically monster hunter, they nailed it too so I was so excited. It's like the second episode I think so I was sold after that.
    The way they have continued rolling out content without gouging their fans has been a thing of beauty.
    I'd be more than happy to buy a new $60 MHW2 in 2021 if MHW content stops this year. Capcom earned as much from my wallet.
It has been their best selling game ever since it came out tho
So will they put more people to work on the PC version ?
As a new fan to monster hunter, congrats i really really really hope we get all the previous best and iconic monsters with World graphics.
That's not even including the 5.2 million units sold for IB. They probably don't count it since it's not a stand-alone game. But I think it should still count, because it's essentially a whole second game.
Gotta give props to Street Fighter II though, for 1991 that game sold a fucking obscene amount of copies, was in every arcade everywhere, even with the exponential growth of the "gamer population" over 20 years to today, it's still 2nd in Capcoms catalog and only shy of 1st place by a tiny margin. Of course that's accounting for 20 years of sales, but one can assume that the lions share was bought initially and it's only made money in trickles since then.
    It is impressive although the last time I checked the stats they were including sales from all sources. That includes the SNES classic which also sold with street fighter 2.
I am happy that a current Gen game break old Gen games sales, and I'd expect they'll care for monster hunter much more globally that how they previously took it. But one thing I am afraid that could happen but hopefully not is that this could set a stone for Capcom to make another installment and rush it for money, hopefully that doesn't happen and they take it patiently to make the next gen monster hunter (Gen 6) an upgrade to world.
Isn't on 20 million or something now? I think they h
Gave a 20 million gift on MHW.
[deleted]
    It's not old it just doesn't count Iceborne.
How the hell did RE5 get that far up? Is the power of memes really that strong?

MHW absolutely deserves the top spot though, I put 430 hours into that game and still have more farming to do.
And I still canâ€™t find a squad to play with ðŸ˜žðŸ˜žðŸ˜žðŸ“‰ðŸ“‰ðŸ“‰ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”
I'm more surprised that SF2 held the record for 27 years.
This means they are going to put even more into the next one because of how much of a success it was
WHAT. 15 million copies sold and I still get 'no SOS found' :(
Honest Capcom is turning into my favorite AAA dev. They games they've been putting out the last few years have been so damn good.
Me: *points at MH 3* we raised that boy :"D
As it should. I hope this makes Capcom shift more attention to this game, it really deserves all the praises
It's a beautiful game full of love by the developers. I always come back to MHW because the universe is so rich.
Brings a tear to my eye to see our baby reach the top.
Which is fucking **crazy** considering how niche the series was relative to their other franchises
Yet even with such a massive playerbase, they can't have all events & sieges available at once. SMH.
I remember when us mega man fans wanted to hate capcom for cancelling megaman legends 3, yet theyâ€™re here releasing good games. How can anyone resist lol
And yet I can't join a populated online lobby ðŸ™„
thank god!  here's hoping for a MHW2.
If you adjust for inflation SF2 still wins by landslide
    It's units sold, not revenue.
Yes and the RE5+6 haters can go suck it.
    Im under the impression that ppl hated em for being more focused on being action movie ish, than horror. I love these games, but I also understand the argument. These are amazing video games but horrible Resident Evil games, if you get my meaning.
        Thatâ€™s the best and most consistent take from fans of the series who got into it with RE4 or earlier

I still love the series and donâ€™t hate the direction it went. Changing the direction of the game towards BOWs pretty much necessitated the gameplay change in order to facilitate the fact that Leon and Chris (and the rest of the cast) couldnâ€™t keep being powerless against the normal T-Virus level zombies forever - much less the plaga and beyond. But even though I donâ€™t hate the new titles, thereâ€™s still a sort of magic that none of them have been able to recapture since that era of survival horror.

(As an aside to address something, tho, having a title be well selling doesnâ€™t translate to it being a good game.)
            that makes extra sense with the fact they went more back to their roots for 7 being mostly powerless against them and they went for a new set of characters
        Those are problems brought on by RE4.  Those fans should not have allowed 4 to hit such numbers in that state.  4 had a grand total of 2 scary bits, the xenomorph bossfight and the moments before you find the special scope.  The rest were hardly different from playing Contra or Doom, but those 2 moments focused on the feeling of helplessness.  Re5+6 offered the same you get from RE4, in the same action : helpless+horror ratio.  If you have a agent who carries firearms and moves like martial artists you have no horror, you give me a weapon and a enemy that i know has a HP bar you lose your horror.  All those criticism on 5 and 6 is actually for 4.
            You might be underestimating RE4's First Impressions. Ive thought about it and there is actually alot of scary moments in RE4. Fighting an entire village, have a guy with chain saw come after you, the dogs you fight at the church, the monster in the lake (the rope that drags Leon I remember filling me with anxiety), the sewer with bugs in the castle, ect.
                You simply have a lower tolerance for stress.  Personally speaking, Those moments might be tense, but not in the way of fear, but rather you are in a tough combat situation.  Only the lake scene comes close to the helplessness that is from the 2 situations i talked about.  Fear works through helplessness.  Needing 30 shots to kill something is still not the same as unloading 60 shots and still doing nothing to it, in that, is fear.
                    Like I said its the First Impression, I first played this game when I was a kid. You what else I played as a kid? Silent Hill. You know what that game taught me? Atmosphere and theme (plus music and sounds) instil just as much fear as feeling helpless in a fight. If your scared of entering the next room or your super cautious about your surroundings? The game has succeeded at being a horror game. RE4 has sections that have action game elements (I am remembering that time your running away from a giant statue...), but I feel it makes up for it in other parts that gives anxiety (like the part in the castle in the sewers with bugs). Anyway ive played this game many times (im planning on getting it again on Switch), and just how I feel about the overall game.
    The Skyrim of Capcom. (In term of multiple console porting)
        Nah, re 4 is Capcom's Skyrim. It has 11 ports, one of them being on the fucking zeebo.
            .. the fuck is a zeebo?

I guess that's your point
                It's an OS for smart gazebos, perhaps? Definitely sounds like it would be.
                Obscure Brazilian console thingy, a really cool piece of obscure tech if you ask me.

[Wikipedia link](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeebo)
        How about sf2 it got like milion versions and its on litterly every piece of electronic
        5 had 10mil+ in sales alone  last gen. It only got remastered once after that.
Makes sense considering its the only on that list ive actually played. Dont venture too far out of my comfort games, both WoW and Dota 2, so the game has to be pretty exceptional to pull me in. Not to say the others arent but they havent grabbed me quite like MHW
    I recommend you play Dark souls trilogy, bloodborne and Sekiro, and hollow knight as well now that I think about it. 
I found quite an interesting find, usually a lot of people who like one of these games would like the rest
        I would add Nioh to that list as well. Top tier game that too many people overlook. Itâ€™s the only game that has combat depth on par with MHW in my experience.
            The combat in Nioh is amazing, everything else is so stupid imo, idk why they decided a stage system and this horrendous loot system compliment this type of game, I honestly canâ€™t recommend Nioh. Maybe 2 but I still havenâ€™t finished it.
                I love the stage system! Too many games are open world just because itâ€™s the cool thing to do lately. And the loot can be overwhelming but once you learn to manage it really adds a lot more depth to the game!
                    In other games, sure these features could have worked wonderfully, not in this game, these decisions bring down the game so much, the only thing thatâ€™s redeeming it is the fantastic combat
                        Iâ€™m glad we could disagree respectfully, haha. The loot was a bummer for me in Nioh 1 first playthru, but after I really got into min maxing and build making in subsequent playthrus I have come to appreciate it for the options it presents. I will say that learning a system for locking down the gear I want to keep and disassembling everything else was crucial to me being able to appreciate the loot system. All that said it definitely has its flaws and I donâ€™t blame anyone for not jiving with it!
                            Yeah I honestly could see how you could love this game(also it isnâ€™t a bad game imo just not as good as these others I mentioned) I mean the combat is probably the best combat in a souls like
                            Yeah I honestly could see how you could love this game(also it isnâ€™t a bad game imo just not as good as these others I mentioned) I mean the combat is probably the best combat in a souls like. 
Anyways have a nice day/night mate!
damm street fighter number, and that was 30 years ago
Ye it's been like this since base world
Iâ€™m surprised Res 6 outsold Res 7... (I liked 6 but 7 was more back to Res roots in terms of horror over action).
    Not to mention 7 was one of the better Resi games in general
Somehow doesnâ€™t surprise me
14 yearold me would be so proud.
Yeah it broke that a while ago now, they haven't updated the sales number in a bit. Also it has the very successful iceborne dlc. It's by FAR capcoms most successful game ever so bet your ass they're already working on another for ps5
Itâ€™s been that way almost since launch. This is nothing new.
Great game I hope we get more DLC
you goshdamn right
Even the base game is enjoyable and lots of content.
I'll hunt to that!
Monster Hunter is the sole reason why I enroll in design course for my degree. Heck I even choose to design a game as my final year research
Real Gs want a new Dragons Dogma
question, does mhw support cross play? or bec i play pc i only play with pc players?
    It doesn't unfortunately.
        Oh that sux. Thanks though
RIP Dragon's Dogma Online.
:D
Does the 600$+ (CAD) include the mtxâ€™s?
Amazing how much SF2 has sold considering the era, Monster hunter world has been very successful but these days with the amount of ads and sales it helps.
I bought it twice, you're welcome Capcom. And thank you
The funny part is that street fighter 2 was 35-40 bucks when is came out and MHW was what 60-70 bucks + MHW iceborne sales would be figured into the revenue for mhw being an expansion. I'd figure if that is taken into account SF2 was the bigger seller. Does this data show the number of copies sold or the revenue of the sales. When SF2 dropped DLC and Microtransactions were not a thing. The goldern age of gaming when you bought a game you got the whole game not just half of it.
    It's number of copies. And it doesn't take Iceborne into account which is another 5 mil.
Hopefully the next game they make will also be a fully fleshed out stay-at-home console game and not another clunky portable game. I understand Japan has a huge market for that sort of stuff, but I'd rather be able to sit down and immerse myself in the game than have to buy a new (overpriced) portable console every couple of years just to play the new MH game. I literally only bought a 3DS for Rune Factory 4 and I never touched it again because it was such a pain to play on in comparison to my PC.
Nice
And yet the Monster Hunter still isn't a character in Smash ðŸ˜”
If they make a World 2 they need to make co-op more accessible and let the hub area be an actual hub area. Let players see other players running around like in other MMOs.
Friend: "Monster Hunter sucks . . . no way it can beat classics like Resident Evil."

Me: "Then could you care to explain these statistics, dumbass?"

Sticking to this franchise from MHTri has seriously paid off.
I'm surprised RE 5 and 6 sold so well
Monster Hunter VR, I'm waiting for you
Well duh, how am I gonna use my Insect Glaive in Resident Evil or Street Fighter???
Yeah we know? They announced this a long time ago well before iceborne. Where you been?
Cool story
Monster Hunter Universe next?
It's just so great and it also have  a lot of content for the price. No one is even close , ( looking at you DLCtiny 2).
This does put a smile on my face
Does this account for inflation? A dollar in Street Fighter 2 days is like 80 cents now (pulling that number out of my hat)
    It's units sold.
        Ah great
Well deserved.
Monster Hunter world is honestly just such a solid game, I've still not bought the expansion though, is it worth it?
    Yes very worth it. Maybe wait for it to go on sale if you donâ€™t wanna spend too much on it.
Such a great game! I just hope they streamline the multiplayer experience in the next one
I felt like resident evil 4 was much better than 5 and 6
It deserves to be there for the rest of time
You get what you fucking deserve!
Huh damn capcom must be fucking rich af even the worse resident evils sold a decent amount
How did re5 and 6 beat re4 in sales
This is great news but Iâ€™m honestly shocked street fighter 2 only sold 15m copies
You have to open or remove the reddit notifications up top...
If it had just been a PS$ exclusive and maybe come to the PC later it wouldn't have sold as much

The fact that they decided to include the Xbox market, which is not that big over in Japan; really helped out

Xbox Fans have been crying out for a MH game for awhile, because many of us are too stuck in our ways to spend another $300 on a system, especially just for a few games
All hail the king!
How could this incredible game isn't the most sold? No that is impossible!
Its concerning that Street Fighter 5 isn't in there
Get um MHW
Is 3 on that website actually Tri? Or one of the jap only releases
    That's all 3rd gen sales combined. (MH3, MHP3rd, MH3U)
        Makes more sense. I loved Tri but as a Wii game I can't imagine it was a great seller by itself
[deleted]
    Their SF2 sales number includes all of the modern ports as well.
Shame it won't come on switch, I burned too many hours on mhgu there. 

MHW is really nice, but it is not portalable for me.
    Get a vita an remote play it
        It surprisingly works well, even with the input lag, since execution and recover animations are naturally long. I normally play Lance, but when I remote play, I use Gunlance since I don't need to time anything except blocking/dodging.
[deleted]
    That figure is all versions of Street Fighter II tallied together.

[Capcom's own site](http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/finance/million.html) lists their games by version.
Uh yea? This has been known for a very long time. Get out of here, karma farmer.
Itâ€™s a game for all platforms that previously only was available for one+ it isnâ€™t in the horror genre of resident evil(havenâ€™t played resident so that are speculations but still)
How did RE 5 and 6 sell better than all the rest..?
Wow just as if i would care(sorry if this makes you sad)
I hate how high RE5 and RE6 are, those are awful games and don't deserve the RE name.
    To be fair RE5 was still enjoyable, given you're paying with another person but RE6 is just... I don't know even
But yet the game still runs like shit and lacks content despite an expansion.
    It does? I think someone just needs a pc upgrade.
        No.

Keep downvoting,keep denying what everyone knows since 2018.

The engine (MT Framework) was just not intended for a game like that. The CPU usage is insane. A modder even tried to improve this and explained [why the game runs so poorly](https://www.dsogaming.com/news/modder-kaldaien-25-of-cpu-usage-in-monster-hunter-world-is-for-switching-active-threads-has-over-100-threads/), it definitely [works in a fucked up way](https://www.dsogaming.com/news/monster-hunter-world-not-detecting-proper-number-of-cpu-cores-one-main-thread-dedicated-to-anti-debug-code/).

It wouldn't be a problem if MHW was technically impressive. But it's not. It looks outdated (and often severely outdated).

What kind of upgrade do you even suggest anyway? Ryzen 3950x and RTX 2080 perhaps?
I mean, what other capcom games have come out that could really compete?
    [deleted]
        Source?

^^/s  ^^of ^^course
        I meant in recent sales.
            Street Fighter II Turbo?
                SUPER Street Fighter II?
                    Street Fighter II and Knuckles?

                            Wait why are we talking about MHW again?
    Resident Evil 4? Maybe
        I meant in recent sales.
            Ohh maybe RE2 remake
            The RE4 remake might.

...they better not mess that up.
                Like they did for 3. Capcom was on a roll until that remake.
                    I think it was good just criminally short. As short as the original but without the replay ability
                    I enjoyed it for what it is. I wish they had diverted money from the multiplayer mode to the singleplayer game, though, or even to a straight-up mercenaries mode.
    The new RE Remales are both fuckin awesome games and so is the new DMC. i guess the only thing those games have shorter play times.
    Dragons Dogma 2
        We can only wish
            Good news, dd2 is coming ðŸ™Œ
Wasn't that announcement that it was their fastest selling game?
    [deleted]
        How can it be 17 million in the first week and then 15,7 million total in the image posted?
        17 million copies sold? I'm not sure how they track money earnings but wouldn't that mean the game made over a billion dollars in its first week?
Because it's the first one to be on xbox
I hope so
    Itâ€™s almost a guarantee but I wonder where that one will go or if theyâ€™ll continue to expand on the new world and everything in it. Hell I wonder if they are already starting to work on the next title.
        Maybe old world + new world maps with a ton of monsters old and new. It is a long stretch but a cool one.
            I could get behind that having old and new I wonder if theyâ€™ll reintroduce old mechanics like water combat and the like and they have potential to add to worlds map and add swamp lands that are less trees and still have some verticality but itâ€™s underneath the water not above they could make underwater with cave systems that you can on dry land again and the like
                That is a good Idea.
                    Thank you! You could create a whole environment with water based monsters you could have crabs and sea serpents you could even create new fish type monsters as well and on the surface of the swamp land you can still have monsters who thrive in wetland or marshy environment it could open possibilities for movement or restrictions of movement and even new blight mechanics.
                        do you really want Plessy back?


like, really?


*gets hipchecked from miles away*
                            Well hopefully theyâ€™d fix the hit boxes and I mean pickles hipcheck has some bullshit as well
                                i rarely fought Jho myself, but Plessy gave me nightmares. i remember almost throwing my PSP due to them hips...
        MRW VR for the Oculus Quest.  

One can only dream of playing IG in VR and vomiting everywhere.
            Just put out a tarp before you play less clean up that way
                In all seriousness I would love a Monster Hunting VR game, clearly it could not be what MH is, with the flashing spinny anime finisher moves that it has and would have to be a totally different feel/game but the core gameplay of fighting massive monsters in VR and crafting gear and fighting other massive monsters, would be awesome.
                    I want to be a monster in VR so I can live out my pickle fantasies
                        You joke, but what if it was a game where you were monsters, hunting the hunters?  And if you're deviljho, rajang or nergigante, hunting other monsters?
                            That was not a joke. I really do have pickle fantasies
                                You're Pickle Riiiiiick!
            Or pulling off the hammer somersault and the dual blade spin on the back.
        So I saw the other day that the Monster Hunter Franchise is managed by two studios (studio Alpha and Beta) and Alpha alone have done World + Iceborne and we haven't heard anything from Beta studio in a while, so likely they are hard at work on something else.

EDIT: We've also been told that Iceborne will be the last expansion of the World series.
            So we could see a new hand held then or they are getting a jump on next console version
            Last expansion? Isn't it the only expansion?
                It is
            Iâ€™m just hoping we get another game based on world cause they have so much they can work with and I hope they expand on the new world and we can bring our characters along with it
            there is also the weirdos from frontier team
        Tbh I think we could see a real open world monster hunter game at some point, with the new consoles having just a massive step up in terms of power, and some of the clearly successful aspects of MHW. I could see them really putting an emphasis with the single world idea and maximizing that potential.
            Iâ€™m curious as to when the next one might come out
        >  Hell I wonder if they are already starting to work on the next title. 

I'd imagine so, but no one knows at what stage it's at right now obviously.

I'm just curious as to whether they'll continue producing "classic" MH on Switch alongside a sequel to World.
            Iâ€™m assuming theyâ€™ll do another sequel to world it was successful I donâ€™t see why they wouldnâ€™t do it or possibly but it at the top of the to do list
        Full Open-World and i am sold.
btw MHW is my first MH game so i donâ€™t know if that sound good for the Veteran hunters or not.
    With the way that World has become their best selling game and as far as I've seen, has overwhelmingly good reviews, I have no doubt that they are going to make another MH game and that will probably sell like hotcakes.
MHW Iceborne Ultimate 2: Championship Edition EX
    With Turbo.
        Hyper Turbo HD Addition Edition.
MHW Iceborne 2: Electric Boogaloo
Tri*
Wouldnâ€™t mind it actually ðŸ˜‚
Imagine Capcom announcing a new Monster Hunter game and it's Monster Hunter Riders 2.
But if they announce MHW Legends 3, I'm not biting.

I fell for that shit once.
Anyone who started with world/iceborn without playing any of the previous titles is equally valid as a fan of this great series and I'm so happy to have more people sharing this amazing experience, the creators put in tons of work and came a long way (especially in the quality of life department) to make this game accessible for new players and it defiantly shows.
    I played MH4U, then MH3U, then GenU, then World. The leap from something like 3U to World is astronomical. I hope they take what they learned from World and add a lot of extra things like swimming and tracking.
        I feel like having a full controller may also be a big factor in making the incorporation of swimming and underwater combat easier, I loved 3U and 4U on the 3DS but I don't think I will ever miss having my right analog be on the touchscreen.
            I had in on the Wii U lmao, my friend got one for family and got the game too but wasn't able to play it well. Swimming will be probably better if it comes back. Be faster, more responsive, etc.
    I started in World, but I like MHGU better. I like the cartoonish weapon and armor designs, and the hunter arts and ability to play as a palico are amazing. In addition the sheer number and variety of monsters is incredible. I wish I had gotten mh3u before my wii u broke.
        If they could take the visual design sense of the old games and cram it on top of the MHW base, I would be a happy camper.
        I am playing through GenU now because of having played through MWH:I. I can't say I like one other better as they both have their obvious differences. I will say however that they are both super fun, and I'm glad World made me get GenU for my Switch.
    That's what I did. I had no idea that there was a Monster Hunter series of games. I didn't even know about World until my friend said he was hyped to get it. I looked it up and it looked cool, but I wasn't super hyped on it. I was wrong. I picked it up and put around 350+ hours into it and then about the same amount of hours into Iceborne. Looking on Steam, I have 736 total hours. I only stopped playing it because Phantasy Star came out. It really is an amazing game and I can say for certain that I WILL get the next Monster Hunter game that comes out.
I sat through both World and Iceborne's endgame credits, for this exact reason xD I realised there were like hundreds of studios involved in this one game
Same. I've started playing World about a month ago and I'm completely hooked. Huge fan.
    Hey man! As a veteran I just want to wish you a warm welcome! Glad to see new blood in our midst!
        Thank you very much! :)
    I tried really hard to get my husband into MH with 4U, but it just couldn't click with him. He bought MHW for me for a birthday present, and then IB for my birthday the next year, and has managed to be so hooked that he's put twice as many hours in as I have.

This game is apparently the fan-maker.
Not to mention probably the best paid DLC of all time. Honestly, Iâ€™d say Iceborne even beats The Ringed City and the Old Hunters DLC from DS3 and BB, and those are generally considered masterpiece DLCs, and two of my personal favorite, as well.
    Indeed, the teams working on monster hunter usually follow the trend of:
Release base game, add a ton of free updates and content, including events

Then after a year or so, the release a new game in the same generation. The expansion adds a new rank (g rank or master rank) l, a ton of new monsters, and some gameplay tweaks. 
In older games it would be called an ultimate version. So from monster hunter 3 to monster 3 ultimate would be the equivalent of going from world to iceborne.
        Ahhhh gotcha, this is actually my first MH, so that makes a lot of sense
The sheer amount of efford that was clearly put into making the monsters behave like actual wildlife is amazing. I'm glad the game is doing so well.
    Not to mention all the little things, like the idle animations for the palico chefs, and the the fully orchestrated unique songs for all the new free content monsters.

You can tell it really is a labor of love, where the ones working on the game actually adore the game and put in far more than just what is required.
Mhw is my first MH game and it's been absolutely amazing.  One of my favorite games ever.  
I'm usually pretty against DLC unless I can get it on sale, but in January I got the base game for $10 and Iceborne for $40 (pan bundle for $50 for both).  I was happy with the base game but I thought I was getting ripped off with the DLC.  
Holy shit I couldn't have been more wrong.  Iceborne is like an entirely new game, with arguably more content in it than the base game had, and they just keep adding in more for free.  

Seriously so awesome!
Bad rep doesnt mean bad selling. Im one of the odd ones who thought 6 was decent. Not good mind you, just entertaining enough to not hate it. But im 33 and grew up playing all the old school resident evils so more RE is good for me.
    Oh 6 is more than decent, itâ€™s a very rich and highly polished game. people talked shit about it but at the end of the day they still had fun with it
        Game was extremely polished, agreed. The converging stories and updated situations of older characters was great as well. Actually, yeah, I dare say it was a damn good game.
            I wish I was able to play that version of RE6
        Half of the game is decent. And i'm not saying incredible, but just decent. The other half is a pile of horseshit. Specially the gunfight parts with Chris Redfield or the stupidly annoying levels with two El Gigantes we have to play twice.
    I played RE6 to death with my wife, it was just a perfect fit her.  
Its hard to get her into gaming, but she loved that game and we did like 10 playthroughs of every team
        Thats just awesome. My girl is not a gamer either but she did love Portal 2 and we played the hell out of the Co Op mode.
    RE6 had a good mercenaries mode, and Sherry's campaign was actually interesting
It sold well because RE5 sold well, RE6 is part of the reason RE7 didn't sell better, despite being a much better game.

A games quality and reception often influence the next in the series.
sales don't reflect a game's quality
What's ironic is that Capcom planned for RE6 to sell way more, so it's not considered a success, at least not in Capcom's eyes.
Pokemon Sword and Shield is one of the best-selling Pokemon games in the franchise, despite Gamersâ„¢ bitching about how bad it is since its first announcement. Reception =/= Sales.
Dragons Dogma 2 will come brother. Hail to Grigori
    We can but dream. The class mixing and matching was great. The fashion potential was out there.
    One of the best game I ever played.
Pretty much introduced mounting for MH4.
    The mounting was what made it. I've never seen anything else that lets you physically crawl up a Cyclops legs, back and face just to mash his eye in before flipping down and destroying some goblins
        Shadow of the Colossus maybe?
Only problem is it aged terribly.

I had fond memories of that game and recently reinstalled it. It took about five minutes of gameplay to realize that it was just straight up MHW gameplay... but far *far* worse and dumbed down.
Or any Devil May Crys. I'm gonna cry ;_;
Well technically they released a Monster Hunter on the PS2. And I believe it took over a decade for them to come back
>ongoing grind

Thatâ€™s what makes this game unbearable to play.
IB has been in top sellers ever since it came out. Always the 1st after promotions too.
    Yep I am glad I found this game when Iceborne release. To be fair I feel like Iceborne completed the game.
        I started playing just a month ago, and in all honesty while playing the MHW part, while knowing that IB and master rank existed, the "end-game" vibe of the high rank was kinda killed. One thing i disliked is that i played the whole MHW campaign and only then bought the expansion, which had major changes for some weapons and the clutch claw. Given that there's no additional download needed for IB, I cant understand why they didnt implement these changes in the base game too.
            Well yeah, the game is good but far from perfect. Maybe because of budget issues or something? Since I don't know what's going on there I just love the game.
Hopefully they add crossplay or cross-saves in the future could really benefit this game.
PC only contributed to a couple million of those sales, it wouldn't be enough on its own.
    It was like... 4,5m copies as of march 2019 though.   
It's almost one third of those sales, so I'd say it's a lot.
        World sold more than that in 3 days of launch.

It went from 8.3 million just before PC launch to 10 million after it launched.

In fact, in Asia alone PS4 World had sold 4 million copies.

Either way, PS4 was the heavy hitter.
            Even if PS4 sold more, still almost one third of 15m last year is a good record. I don't know why you have an urge to tell me that PS4 sold more, but ok.
                I don't, but PC sales are nothing more than "we should keep porting later" numbers.

They are not the numbers for developing explicitly for PC.
                    ...Are you dumb?

I just said in my first post that I hope, because of those numbers, they will put more games on PC and you just said those numbers don't mean anything other that they will put other games on PC.
                        Rude.

How exactly does someone decide whether you meant PC exclusives or ports?
                            You know PC content is caught up to consoles now right? You can stop with your ps4 hard-on. We get it ps4 sold more.
                                What does that have to do with literally anything?

Also the joke's on you, I don't even have the PS4 version, I use the version that sold a tiny portion, even next to PC.
                            Idk...by reading his original post and using the context of, "I would love to try playing with MHGU weapon arts and stuff," to come to the obvious conclusion that he's referring to ports for PC...
                                The "obvious conclusion" is Capcom aren't going to release a mediocre-looking game on PC after World and so they mean new games.
                            With the fact I said I want to try out the MHGU I'd say it's pretty easy.   
Also the fact that I never said anything about exclusives, just PC releases. A PC release doesn't have to be exclusive.
                                If you want to try out MHGU then you get a switch. You don't expect people to think you want a 3DS game ported to PC.

You never said anything about ports either. PC release is either or.
I dunno where that list creator got those numbers from but 3U sold 2.6M, Tri is 1.9M. They're among the least selling individual MH titles ever. Maybe they combined it with Portable 3rd/Freedom 3, the second best selling individual MH title? Which is literally a whole different game altogether from 3 and 3U lol 
http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/finance/million.html

What a weird graph lol
    Yeah, Freedom 3 shouldn't be clumped in with 3/3U. Different village, less maps, and less monsters. MH4/4U definitely would take the 2nd top selling after World/IB, which I believe is the superior game compared to 3/3U.
    Wasn't portable 3rd the place Holder for tri on the psp and PS3? Thought I Read that somewhere so could be the reason why they clumped together.
    "monster hunter freedom 3", yeah, lets split salt to the open western world wound -_-
It had the benefit of being on Wii too, which sold phenomenally well.
Yeah, since it came out.
Doesn't really matter tbh, considering SF2 is only so high due to their multiple versions and arcades having to buy new cabinets to stay up-to-date. Oh, and I'm sure they include even mobile ports into that number, including GameBoy SF2.
    I like how I'm curious about how many of the community bought the game multiple times and you're over here telling me my personal intrigue doesn't matter and rambling about Street Fighter.
Games aren't measured in cash like movies.

They're measured by how many units are dispatched to stores.
    I know that was just confused bc I previously read that mhw is the most sold game capcom ever had but according to this statistic thatâ€™d be false
        It's still true though.
            Yeah but that was half a year ago and by this statistic half a year ago mhw was not the best selling capcom game of all time so i was just confused
The anime Haganai has them playing a game together as group activity and it is basically monster hunter, they nailed it too so I was so excited. It's like the second episode I think so I was sold after that.
The way they have continued rolling out content without gouging their fans has been a thing of beauty.
I'd be more than happy to buy a new $60 MHW2 in 2021 if MHW content stops this year. Capcom earned as much from my wallet.
It is impressive although the last time I checked the stats they were including sales from all sources. That includes the SNES classic which also sold with street fighter 2.
It's not old it just doesn't count Iceborne.
It's units sold, not revenue.
Im under the impression that ppl hated em for being more focused on being action movie ish, than horror. I love these games, but I also understand the argument. These are amazing video games but horrible Resident Evil games, if you get my meaning.
    Thatâ€™s the best and most consistent take from fans of the series who got into it with RE4 or earlier

I still love the series and donâ€™t hate the direction it went. Changing the direction of the game towards BOWs pretty much necessitated the gameplay change in order to facilitate the fact that Leon and Chris (and the rest of the cast) couldnâ€™t keep being powerless against the normal T-Virus level zombies forever - much less the plaga and beyond. But even though I donâ€™t hate the new titles, thereâ€™s still a sort of magic that none of them have been able to recapture since that era of survival horror.

(As an aside to address something, tho, having a title be well selling doesnâ€™t translate to it being a good game.)
        that makes extra sense with the fact they went more back to their roots for 7 being mostly powerless against them and they went for a new set of characters
    Those are problems brought on by RE4.  Those fans should not have allowed 4 to hit such numbers in that state.  4 had a grand total of 2 scary bits, the xenomorph bossfight and the moments before you find the special scope.  The rest were hardly different from playing Contra or Doom, but those 2 moments focused on the feeling of helplessness.  Re5+6 offered the same you get from RE4, in the same action : helpless+horror ratio.  If you have a agent who carries firearms and moves like martial artists you have no horror, you give me a weapon and a enemy that i know has a HP bar you lose your horror.  All those criticism on 5 and 6 is actually for 4.
        You might be underestimating RE4's First Impressions. Ive thought about it and there is actually alot of scary moments in RE4. Fighting an entire village, have a guy with chain saw come after you, the dogs you fight at the church, the monster in the lake (the rope that drags Leon I remember filling me with anxiety), the sewer with bugs in the castle, ect.
            You simply have a lower tolerance for stress.  Personally speaking, Those moments might be tense, but not in the way of fear, but rather you are in a tough combat situation.  Only the lake scene comes close to the helplessness that is from the 2 situations i talked about.  Fear works through helplessness.  Needing 30 shots to kill something is still not the same as unloading 60 shots and still doing nothing to it, in that, is fear.
                Like I said its the First Impression, I first played this game when I was a kid. You what else I played as a kid? Silent Hill. You know what that game taught me? Atmosphere and theme (plus music and sounds) instil just as much fear as feeling helpless in a fight. If your scared of entering the next room or your super cautious about your surroundings? The game has succeeded at being a horror game. RE4 has sections that have action game elements (I am remembering that time your running away from a giant statue...), but I feel it makes up for it in other parts that gives anxiety (like the part in the castle in the sewers with bugs). Anyway ive played this game many times (im planning on getting it again on Switch), and just how I feel about the overall game.
The Skyrim of Capcom. (In term of multiple console porting)
    Nah, re 4 is Capcom's Skyrim. It has 11 ports, one of them being on the fucking zeebo.
        .. the fuck is a zeebo?

I guess that's your point
            It's an OS for smart gazebos, perhaps? Definitely sounds like it would be.
            Obscure Brazilian console thingy, a really cool piece of obscure tech if you ask me.

[Wikipedia link](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeebo)
    How about sf2 it got like milion versions and its on litterly every piece of electronic
    5 had 10mil+ in sales alone  last gen. It only got remastered once after that.
I recommend you play Dark souls trilogy, bloodborne and Sekiro, and hollow knight as well now that I think about it. 
I found quite an interesting find, usually a lot of people who like one of these games would like the rest
    I would add Nioh to that list as well. Top tier game that too many people overlook. Itâ€™s the only game that has combat depth on par with MHW in my experience.
        The combat in Nioh is amazing, everything else is so stupid imo, idk why they decided a stage system and this horrendous loot system compliment this type of game, I honestly canâ€™t recommend Nioh. Maybe 2 but I still havenâ€™t finished it.
            I love the stage system! Too many games are open world just because itâ€™s the cool thing to do lately. And the loot can be overwhelming but once you learn to manage it really adds a lot more depth to the game!
                In other games, sure these features could have worked wonderfully, not in this game, these decisions bring down the game so much, the only thing thatâ€™s redeeming it is the fantastic combat
                    Iâ€™m glad we could disagree respectfully, haha. The loot was a bummer for me in Nioh 1 first playthru, but after I really got into min maxing and build making in subsequent playthrus I have come to appreciate it for the options it presents. I will say that learning a system for locking down the gear I want to keep and disassembling everything else was crucial to me being able to appreciate the loot system. All that said it definitely has its flaws and I donâ€™t blame anyone for not jiving with it!
                        Yeah I honestly could see how you could love this game(also it isnâ€™t a bad game imo just not as good as these others I mentioned) I mean the combat is probably the best combat in a souls like
                        Yeah I honestly could see how you could love this game(also it isnâ€™t a bad game imo just not as good as these others I mentioned) I mean the combat is probably the best combat in a souls like. 
Anyways have a nice day/night mate!
Not to mention 7 was one of the better Resi games in general
It doesn't unfortunately.
    Oh that sux. Thanks though
It's number of copies. And it doesn't take Iceborne into account which is another 5 mil.
It's units sold.
    Ah great
Yes very worth it. Maybe wait for it to go on sale if you donâ€™t wanna spend too much on it.
That's all 3rd gen sales combined. (MH3, MHP3rd, MH3U)
    Makes more sense. I loved Tri but as a Wii game I can't imagine it was a great seller by itself
Their SF2 sales number includes all of the modern ports as well.
Get a vita an remote play it
    It surprisingly works well, even with the input lag, since execution and recover animations are naturally long. I normally play Lance, but when I remote play, I use Gunlance since I don't need to time anything except blocking/dodging.
That figure is all versions of Street Fighter II tallied together.

[Capcom's own site](http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/finance/million.html) lists their games by version.
To be fair RE5 was still enjoyable, given you're paying with another person but RE6 is just... I don't know even
It does? I think someone just needs a pc upgrade.
    No.

Keep downvoting,keep denying what everyone knows since 2018.

The engine (MT Framework) was just not intended for a game like that. The CPU usage is insane. A modder even tried to improve this and explained [why the game runs so poorly](https://www.dsogaming.com/news/modder-kaldaien-25-of-cpu-usage-in-monster-hunter-world-is-for-switching-active-threads-has-over-100-threads/), it definitely [works in a fucked up way](https://www.dsogaming.com/news/monster-hunter-world-not-detecting-proper-number-of-cpu-cores-one-main-thread-dedicated-to-anti-debug-code/).

It wouldn't be a problem if MHW was technically impressive. But it's not. It looks outdated (and often severely outdated).

What kind of upgrade do you even suggest anyway? Ryzen 3950x and RTX 2080 perhaps?

    Source?

^^/s  ^^of ^^course
    I meant in recent sales.
        Street Fighter II Turbo?
            SUPER Street Fighter II?
                Street Fighter II and Knuckles?
                    Featuring Dante from the Devil May Cry Series?
                        Game of the year edition?

                            Directorâ€™s cut?
                        Wait why are we talking about MHW again?
Resident Evil 4? Maybe
    I meant in recent sales.
        Ohh maybe RE2 remake
        The RE4 remake might.

...they better not mess that up.
            Like they did for 3. Capcom was on a roll until that remake.
                I think it was good just criminally short. As short as the original but without the replay ability
                I enjoyed it for what it is. I wish they had diverted money from the multiplayer mode to the singleplayer game, though, or even to a straight-up mercenaries mode.
The new RE Remales are both fuckin awesome games and so is the new DMC. i guess the only thing those games have shorter play times.
Dragons Dogma 2

    How can it be 17 million in the first week and then 15,7 million total in the image posted?
    17 million copies sold? I'm not sure how they track money earnings but wouldn't that mean the game made over a billion dollars in its first week?
Itâ€™s almost a guarantee but I wonder where that one will go or if theyâ€™ll continue to expand on the new world and everything in it. Hell I wonder if they are already starting to work on the next title.
    Maybe old world + new world maps with a ton of monsters old and new. It is a long stretch but a cool one.
        I could get behind that having old and new I wonder if theyâ€™ll reintroduce old mechanics like water combat and the like and they have potential to add to worlds map and add swamp lands that are less trees and still have some verticality but itâ€™s underneath the water not above they could make underwater with cave systems that you can on dry land again and the like
            That is a good Idea.
                Thank you! You could create a whole environment with water based monsters you could have crabs and sea serpents you could even create new fish type monsters as well and on the surface of the swamp land you can still have monsters who thrive in wetland or marshy environment it could open possibilities for movement or restrictions of movement and even new blight mechanics.
                    do you really want Plessy back?


like, really?


*gets hipchecked from miles away*
                        Well hopefully theyâ€™d fix the hit boxes and I mean pickles hipcheck has some bullshit as well
                            i rarely fought Jho myself, but Plessy gave me nightmares. i remember almost throwing my PSP due to them hips...
    MRW VR for the Oculus Quest.  

One can only dream of playing IG in VR and vomiting everywhere.
        Just put out a tarp before you play less clean up that way
            In all seriousness I would love a Monster Hunting VR game, clearly it could not be what MH is, with the flashing spinny anime finisher moves that it has and would have to be a totally different feel/game but the core gameplay of fighting massive monsters in VR and crafting gear and fighting other massive monsters, would be awesome.
                I want to be a monster in VR so I can live out my pickle fantasies
                    You joke, but what if it was a game where you were monsters, hunting the hunters?  And if you're deviljho, rajang or nergigante, hunting other monsters?
                        That was not a joke. I really do have pickle fantasies
                            You're Pickle Riiiiiick!
        Or pulling off the hammer somersault and the dual blade spin on the back.
    So I saw the other day that the Monster Hunter Franchise is managed by two studios (studio Alpha and Beta) and Alpha alone have done World + Iceborne and we haven't heard anything from Beta studio in a while, so likely they are hard at work on something else.

EDIT: We've also been told that Iceborne will be the last expansion of the World series.
        So we could see a new hand held then or they are getting a jump on next console version
        Last expansion? Isn't it the only expansion?
            It is
        Iâ€™m just hoping we get another game based on world cause they have so much they can work with and I hope they expand on the new world and we can bring our characters along with it
        there is also the weirdos from frontier team
    Tbh I think we could see a real open world monster hunter game at some point, with the new consoles having just a massive step up in terms of power, and some of the clearly successful aspects of MHW. I could see them really putting an emphasis with the single world idea and maximizing that potential.
        Iâ€™m curious as to when the next one might come out
    >  Hell I wonder if they are already starting to work on the next title. 

I'd imagine so, but no one knows at what stage it's at right now obviously.

I'm just curious as to whether they'll continue producing "classic" MH on Switch alongside a sequel to World.
        Iâ€™m assuming theyâ€™ll do another sequel to world it was successful I donâ€™t see why they wouldnâ€™t do it or possibly but it at the top of the to do list
    Full Open-World and i am sold.
btw MHW is my first MH game so i donâ€™t know if that sound good for the Veteran hunters or not.
With the way that World has become their best selling game and as far as I've seen, has overwhelmingly good reviews, I have no doubt that they are going to make another MH game and that will probably sell like hotcakes.
With Turbo.
    Hyper Turbo HD Addition Edition.
I played MH4U, then MH3U, then GenU, then World. The leap from something like 3U to World is astronomical. I hope they take what they learned from World and add a lot of extra things like swimming and tracking.
    I feel like having a full controller may also be a big factor in making the incorporation of swimming and underwater combat easier, I loved 3U and 4U on the 3DS but I don't think I will ever miss having my right analog be on the touchscreen.
        I had in on the Wii U lmao, my friend got one for family and got the game too but wasn't able to play it well. Swimming will be probably better if it comes back. Be faster, more responsive, etc.
I started in World, but I like MHGU better. I like the cartoonish weapon and armor designs, and the hunter arts and ability to play as a palico are amazing. In addition the sheer number and variety of monsters is incredible. I wish I had gotten mh3u before my wii u broke.
    If they could take the visual design sense of the old games and cram it on top of the MHW base, I would be a happy camper.
    I am playing through GenU now because of having played through MWH:I. I can't say I like one other better as they both have their obvious differences. I will say however that they are both super fun, and I'm glad World made me get GenU for my Switch.
That's what I did. I had no idea that there was a Monster Hunter series of games. I didn't even know about World until my friend said he was hyped to get it. I looked it up and it looked cool, but I wasn't super hyped on it. I was wrong. I picked it up and put around 350+ hours into it and then about the same amount of hours into Iceborne. Looking on Steam, I have 736 total hours. I only stopped playing it because Phantasy Star came out. It really is an amazing game and I can say for certain that I WILL get the next Monster Hunter game that comes out.
Hey man! As a veteran I just want to wish you a warm welcome! Glad to see new blood in our midst!
    Thank you very much! :)
I tried really hard to get my husband into MH with 4U, but it just couldn't click with him. He bought MHW for me for a birthday present, and then IB for my birthday the next year, and has managed to be so hooked that he's put twice as many hours in as I have.

This game is apparently the fan-maker.
Indeed, the teams working on monster hunter usually follow the trend of:
Release base game, add a ton of free updates and content, including events

Then after a year or so, the release a new game in the same generation. The expansion adds a new rank (g rank or master rank) l, a ton of new monsters, and some gameplay tweaks. 
In older games it would be called an ultimate version. So from monster hunter 3 to monster 3 ultimate would be the equivalent of going from world to iceborne.
    Ahhhh gotcha, this is actually my first MH, so that makes a lot of sense
Not to mention all the little things, like the idle animations for the palico chefs, and the the fully orchestrated unique songs for all the new free content monsters.

You can tell it really is a labor of love, where the ones working on the game actually adore the game and put in far more than just what is required.
Oh 6 is more than decent, itâ€™s a very rich and highly polished game. people talked shit about it but at the end of the day they still had fun with it
    Game was extremely polished, agreed. The converging stories and updated situations of older characters was great as well. Actually, yeah, I dare say it was a damn good game.
        I wish I was able to play that version of RE6
    Half of the game is decent. And i'm not saying incredible, but just decent. The other half is a pile of horseshit. Specially the gunfight parts with Chris Redfield or the stupidly annoying levels with two El Gigantes we have to play twice.
I played RE6 to death with my wife, it was just a perfect fit her.  
Its hard to get her into gaming, but she loved that game and we did like 10 playthroughs of every team
    Thats just awesome. My girl is not a gamer either but she did love Portal 2 and we played the hell out of the Co Op mode.
RE6 had a good mercenaries mode, and Sherry's campaign was actually interesting
We can but dream. The class mixing and matching was great. The fashion potential was out there.
One of the best game I ever played.
The mounting was what made it. I've never seen anything else that lets you physically crawl up a Cyclops legs, back and face just to mash his eye in before flipping down and destroying some goblins
    Shadow of the Colossus maybe?
Yep I am glad I found this game when Iceborne release. To be fair I feel like Iceborne completed the game.
    I started playing just a month ago, and in all honesty while playing the MHW part, while knowing that IB and master rank existed, the "end-game" vibe of the high rank was kinda killed. One thing i disliked is that i played the whole MHW campaign and only then bought the expansion, which had major changes for some weapons and the clutch claw. Given that there's no additional download needed for IB, I cant understand why they didnt implement these changes in the base game too.
        Well yeah, the game is good but far from perfect. Maybe because of budget issues or something? Since I don't know what's going on there I just love the game.
It was like... 4,5m copies as of march 2019 though.   
It's almost one third of those sales, so I'd say it's a lot.
    World sold more than that in 3 days of launch.

It went from 8.3 million just before PC launch to 10 million after it launched.

In fact, in Asia alone PS4 World had sold 4 million copies.

Either way, PS4 was the heavy hitter.
        Even if PS4 sold more, still almost one third of 15m last year is a good record. I don't know why you have an urge to tell me that PS4 sold more, but ok.
            I don't, but PC sales are nothing more than "we should keep porting later" numbers.

They are not the numbers for developing explicitly for PC.
                ...Are you dumb?

I just said in my first post that I hope, because of those numbers, they will put more games on PC and you just said those numbers don't mean anything other that they will put other games on PC.
                    Rude.

How exactly does someone decide whether you meant PC exclusives or ports?
                        You know PC content is caught up to consoles now right? You can stop with your ps4 hard-on. We get it ps4 sold more.
                            What does that have to do with literally anything?

Also the joke's on you, I don't even have the PS4 version, I use the version that sold a tiny portion, even next to PC.
                        Idk...by reading his original post and using the context of, "I would love to try playing with MHGU weapon arts and stuff," to come to the obvious conclusion that he's referring to ports for PC...

                            If you want to try out MHGU then you get a switch. You don't expect people to think you want a 3DS game ported to PC.

You never said anything about ports either. PC release is either or.
Yeah, Freedom 3 shouldn't be clumped in with 3/3U. Different village, less maps, and less monsters. MH4/4U definitely would take the 2nd top selling after World/IB, which I believe is the superior game compared to 3/3U.
Wasn't portable 3rd the place Holder for tri on the psp and PS3? Thought I Read that somewhere so could be the reason why they clumped together.
"monster hunter freedom 3", yeah, lets split salt to the open western world wound -_-
I like how I'm curious about how many of the community bought the game multiple times and you're over here telling me my personal intrigue doesn't matter and rambling about Street Fighter.
I know that was just confused bc I previously read that mhw is the most sold game capcom ever had but according to this statistic thatâ€™d be false
    It's still true though.

    that makes extra sense with the fact they went more back to their roots for 7 being mostly powerless against them and they went for a new set of characters
Those are problems brought on by RE4.  Those fans should not have allowed 4 to hit such numbers in that state.  4 had a grand total of 2 scary bits, the xenomorph bossfight and the moments before you find the special scope.  The rest were hardly different from playing Contra or Doom, but those 2 moments focused on the feeling of helplessness.  Re5+6 offered the same you get from RE4, in the same action : helpless+horror ratio.  If you have a agent who carries firearms and moves like martial artists you have no horror, you give me a weapon and a enemy that i know has a HP bar you lose your horror.  All those criticism on 5 and 6 is actually for 4.
    You might be underestimating RE4's First Impressions. Ive thought about it and there is actually alot of scary moments in RE4. Fighting an entire village, have a guy with chain saw come after you, the dogs you fight at the church, the monster in the lake (the rope that drags Leon I remember filling me with anxiety), the sewer with bugs in the castle, ect.
        You simply have a lower tolerance for stress.  Personally speaking, Those moments might be tense, but not in the way of fear, but rather you are in a tough combat situation.  Only the lake scene comes close to the helplessness that is from the 2 situations i talked about.  Fear works through helplessness.  Needing 30 shots to kill something is still not the same as unloading 60 shots and still doing nothing to it, in that, is fear.
            Like I said its the First Impression, I first played this game when I was a kid. You what else I played as a kid? Silent Hill. You know what that game taught me? Atmosphere and theme (plus music and sounds) instil just as much fear as feeling helpless in a fight. If your scared of entering the next room or your super cautious about your surroundings? The game has succeeded at being a horror game. RE4 has sections that have action game elements (I am remembering that time your running away from a giant statue...), but I feel it makes up for it in other parts that gives anxiety (like the part in the castle in the sewers with bugs). Anyway ive played this game many times (im planning on getting it again on Switch), and just how I feel about the overall game.
Nah, re 4 is Capcom's Skyrim. It has 11 ports, one of them being on the fucking zeebo.
    .. the fuck is a zeebo?

I guess that's your point
        It's an OS for smart gazebos, perhaps? Definitely sounds like it would be.
        Obscure Brazilian console thingy, a really cool piece of obscure tech if you ask me.

How about sf2 it got like milion versions and its on litterly every piece of electronic
5 had 10mil+ in sales alone  last gen. It only got remastered once after that.
I would add Nioh to that list as well. Top tier game that too many people overlook. Itâ€™s the only game that has combat depth on par with MHW in my experience.
    The combat in Nioh is amazing, everything else is so stupid imo, idk why they decided a stage system and this horrendous loot system compliment this type of game, I honestly canâ€™t recommend Nioh. Maybe 2 but I still havenâ€™t finished it.
        I love the stage system! Too many games are open world just because itâ€™s the cool thing to do lately. And the loot can be overwhelming but once you learn to manage it really adds a lot more depth to the game!
            In other games, sure these features could have worked wonderfully, not in this game, these decisions bring down the game so much, the only thing thatâ€™s redeeming it is the fantastic combat
                Iâ€™m glad we could disagree respectfully, haha. The loot was a bummer for me in Nioh 1 first playthru, but after I really got into min maxing and build making in subsequent playthrus I have come to appreciate it for the options it presents. I will say that learning a system for locking down the gear I want to keep and disassembling everything else was crucial to me being able to appreciate the loot system. All that said it definitely has its flaws and I donâ€™t blame anyone for not jiving with it!
                    Yeah I honestly could see how you could love this game(also it isnâ€™t a bad game imo just not as good as these others I mentioned) I mean the combat is probably the best combat in a souls like

Anyways have a nice day/night mate!
Oh that sux. Thanks though
Ah great
Makes more sense. I loved Tri but as a Wii game I can't imagine it was a great seller by itself
It surprisingly works well, even with the input lag, since execution and recover animations are naturally long. I normally play Lance, but when I remote play, I use Gunlance since I don't need to time anything except blocking/dodging.
No.

Keep downvoting,keep denying what everyone knows since 2018.

The engine (MT Framework) was just not intended for a game like that. The CPU usage is insane. A modder even tried to improve this and explained [why the game runs so poorly](https://www.dsogaming.com/news/modder-kaldaien-25-of-cpu-usage-in-monster-hunter-world-is-for-switching-active-threads-has-over-100-threads/), it definitely [works in a fucked up way](https://www.dsogaming.com/news/monster-hunter-world-not-detecting-proper-number-of-cpu-cores-one-main-thread-dedicated-to-anti-debug-code/).

It wouldn't be a problem if MHW was technically impressive. But it's not. It looks outdated (and often severely outdated).

What kind of upgrade do you even suggest anyway? Ryzen 3950x and RTX 2080 perhaps?
Source?

^^/s  ^^of ^^course
I meant in recent sales.

I meant in recent sales.
    Ohh maybe RE2 remake
    The RE4 remake might.

...they better not mess that up.
        Like they did for 3. Capcom was on a roll until that remake.
            I think it was good just criminally short. As short as the original but without the replay ability
            I enjoyed it for what it is. I wish they had diverted money from the multiplayer mode to the singleplayer game, though, or even to a straight-up mercenaries mode.
We can only wish
    Good news, dd2 is coming ðŸ™Œ
How can it be 17 million in the first week and then 15,7 million total in the image posted?
17 million copies sold? I'm not sure how they track money earnings but wouldn't that mean the game made over a billion dollars in its first week?
Maybe old world + new world maps with a ton of monsters old and new. It is a long stretch but a cool one.
    I could get behind that having old and new I wonder if theyâ€™ll reintroduce old mechanics like water combat and the like and they have potential to add to worlds map and add swamp lands that are less trees and still have some verticality but itâ€™s underneath the water not above they could make underwater with cave systems that you can on dry land again and the like
        That is a good Idea.
            Thank you! You could create a whole environment with water based monsters you could have crabs and sea serpents you could even create new fish type monsters as well and on the surface of the swamp land you can still have monsters who thrive in wetland or marshy environment it could open possibilities for movement or restrictions of movement and even new blight mechanics.
                do you really want Plessy back?


like, really?


*gets hipchecked from miles away*
                    Well hopefully theyâ€™d fix the hit boxes and I mean pickles hipcheck has some bullshit as well
                        i rarely fought Jho myself, but Plessy gave me nightmares. i remember almost throwing my PSP due to them hips...
MRW VR for the Oculus Quest.  

One can only dream of playing IG in VR and vomiting everywhere.
    Just put out a tarp before you play less clean up that way
        In all seriousness I would love a Monster Hunting VR game, clearly it could not be what MH is, with the flashing spinny anime finisher moves that it has and would have to be a totally different feel/game but the core gameplay of fighting massive monsters in VR and crafting gear and fighting other massive monsters, would be awesome.
            I want to be a monster in VR so I can live out my pickle fantasies
                You joke, but what if it was a game where you were monsters, hunting the hunters?  And if you're deviljho, rajang or nergigante, hunting other monsters?
                    That was not a joke. I really do have pickle fantasies
                        You're Pickle Riiiiiick!
    Or pulling off the hammer somersault and the dual blade spin on the back.
So I saw the other day that the Monster Hunter Franchise is managed by two studios (studio Alpha and Beta) and Alpha alone have done World + Iceborne and we haven't heard anything from Beta studio in a while, so likely they are hard at work on something else.

EDIT: We've also been told that Iceborne will be the last expansion of the World series.
    So we could see a new hand held then or they are getting a jump on next console version
    Last expansion? Isn't it the only expansion?
        It is
    Iâ€™m just hoping we get another game based on world cause they have so much they can work with and I hope they expand on the new world and we can bring our characters along with it
    there is also the weirdos from frontier team
Tbh I think we could see a real open world monster hunter game at some point, with the new consoles having just a massive step up in terms of power, and some of the clearly successful aspects of MHW. I could see them really putting an emphasis with the single world idea and maximizing that potential.
    Iâ€™m curious as to when the next one might come out
>  Hell I wonder if they are already starting to work on the next title. 

I'd imagine so, but no one knows at what stage it's at right now obviously.

I'm just curious as to whether they'll continue producing "classic" MH on Switch alongside a sequel to World.
    Iâ€™m assuming theyâ€™ll do another sequel to world it was successful I donâ€™t see why they wouldnâ€™t do it or possibly but it at the top of the to do list
Full Open-World and i am sold.
btw MHW is my first MH game so i donâ€™t know if that sound good for the Veteran hunters or not.
Hyper Turbo HD Addition Edition.
I feel like having a full controller may also be a big factor in making the incorporation of swimming and underwater combat easier, I loved 3U and 4U on the 3DS but I don't think I will ever miss having my right analog be on the touchscreen.
    I had in on the Wii U lmao, my friend got one for family and got the game too but wasn't able to play it well. Swimming will be probably better if it comes back. Be faster, more responsive, etc.
If they could take the visual design sense of the old games and cram it on top of the MHW base, I would be a happy camper.
I am playing through GenU now because of having played through MWH:I. I can't say I like one other better as they both have their obvious differences. I will say however that they are both super fun, and I'm glad World made me get GenU for my Switch.
Thank you very much! :)
Ahhhh gotcha, this is actually my first MH, so that makes a lot of sense
Game was extremely polished, agreed. The converging stories and updated situations of older characters was great as well. Actually, yeah, I dare say it was a damn good game.
    I wish I was able to play that version of RE6
Half of the game is decent. And i'm not saying incredible, but just decent. The other half is a pile of horseshit. Specially the gunfight parts with Chris Redfield or the stupidly annoying levels with two El Gigantes we have to play twice.
Thats just awesome. My girl is not a gamer either but she did love Portal 2 and we played the hell out of the Co Op mode.
Shadow of the Colossus maybe?
I started playing just a month ago, and in all honesty while playing the MHW part, while knowing that IB and master rank existed, the "end-game" vibe of the high rank was kinda killed. One thing i disliked is that i played the whole MHW campaign and only then bought the expansion, which had major changes for some weapons and the clutch claw. Given that there's no additional download needed for IB, I cant understand why they didnt implement these changes in the base game too.
    Well yeah, the game is good but far from perfect. Maybe because of budget issues or something? Since I don't know what's going on there I just love the game.
World sold more than that in 3 days of launch.

It went from 8.3 million just before PC launch to 10 million after it launched.

In fact, in Asia alone PS4 World had sold 4 million copies.

Either way, PS4 was the heavy hitter.
    Even if PS4 sold more, still almost one third of 15m last year is a good record. I don't know why you have an urge to tell me that PS4 sold more, but ok.
        I don't, but PC sales are nothing more than "we should keep porting later" numbers.

They are not the numbers for developing explicitly for PC.
            ...Are you dumb?

I just said in my first post that I hope, because of those numbers, they will put more games on PC and you just said those numbers don't mean anything other that they will put other games on PC.
                Rude.

How exactly does someone decide whether you meant PC exclusives or ports?
                    You know PC content is caught up to consoles now right? You can stop with your ps4 hard-on. We get it ps4 sold more.
                        What does that have to do with literally anything?

Also the joke's on you, I don't even have the PS4 version, I use the version that sold a tiny portion, even next to PC.
                    Idk...by reading his original post and using the context of, "I would love to try playing with MHGU weapon arts and stuff," to come to the obvious conclusion that he's referring to ports for PC...
                        The "obvious conclusion" is Capcom aren't going to release a mediocre-looking game on PC after World and so they mean new games.
                    With the fact I said I want to try out the MHGU I'd say it's pretty easy.   
Also the fact that I never said anything about exclusives, just PC releases. A PC release doesn't have to be exclusive.
                        If you want to try out MHGU then you get a switch. You don't expect people to think you want a 3DS game ported to PC.

You never said anything about ports either. PC release is either or.
It's still true though.
    Yeah but that was half a year ago and by this statistic half a year ago mhw was not the best selling capcom game of all time so i was just confused
that makes extra sense with the fact they went more back to their roots for 7 being mostly powerless against them and they went for a new set of characters
You might be underestimating RE4's First Impressions. Ive thought about it and there is actually alot of scary moments in RE4. Fighting an entire village, have a guy with chain saw come after you, the dogs you fight at the church, the monster in the lake (the rope that drags Leon I remember filling me with anxiety), the sewer with bugs in the castle, ect.

            That was not a joke. I really do have pickle fantasies
                You're Pickle Riiiiiick!
It is
I don't, but PC sales are nothing more than "we should keep porting later" numbers.

They are not the numbers for developing explicitly for PC.
    ...Are you dumb?

I just said in my first post that I hope, because of those numbers, they will put more games on PC and you just said those numbers don't mean anything other that they will put other games on PC.
        Rude.

How exactly does someone decide whether you meant PC exclusives or ports?
            You know PC content is caught up to consoles now right? You can stop with your ps4 hard-on. We get it ps4 sold more.
                What does that have to do with literally anything?

Also the joke's on you, I don't even have the PS4 version, I use the version that sold a tiny portion, even next to PC.
            Idk...by reading his original post and using the context of, "I would love to try playing with MHGU weapon arts and stuff," to come to the obvious conclusion that he's referring to ports for PC...
                The "obvious conclusion" is Capcom aren't going to release a mediocre-looking game on PC after World and so they mean new games.
            With the fact I said I want to try out the MHGU I'd say it's pretty easy.   
Also the fact that I never said anything about exclusives, just PC releases. A PC release doesn't have to be exclusive.
                If you want to try out MHGU then you get a switch. You don't expect people to think you want a 3DS game ported to PC.

You never said anything about ports either. PC release is either or.
Like I said its the First Impression, I first played this game when I was a kid. You what else I played as a kid? Silent Hill. You know what that game taught me? Atmosphere and theme (plus music and sounds) instil just as much fear as feeling helpless in a fight. If your scared of entering the next room or your super cautious about your surroundings? The game has succeeded at being a horror game. RE4 has sections that have action game elements (I am remembering that time your running away from a giant statue...), but I feel it makes up for it in other parts that gives anxiety (like the part in the castle in the sewers with bugs). Anyway ive played this game many times (im planning on getting it again on Switch), and just how I feel about the overall game.
In other games, sure these features could have worked wonderfully, not in this game, these decisions bring down the game so much, the only thing thatâ€™s redeeming it is the fantastic combat
    Iâ€™m glad we could disagree respectfully, haha. The loot was a bummer for me in Nioh 1 first playthru, but after I really got into min maxing and build making in subsequent playthrus I have come to appreciate it for the options it presents. I will say that learning a system for locking down the gear I want to keep and disassembling everything else was crucial to me being able to appreciate the loot system. All that said it definitely has its flaws and I donâ€™t blame anyone for not jiving with it!
        Yeah I honestly could see how you could love this game(also it isnâ€™t a bad game imo just not as good as these others I mentioned) I mean the combat is probably the best combat in a souls like

Anyways have a nice day/night mate!
Street Fighter II and Knuckles?
    Featuring Dante from the Devil May Cry Series?
        Game of the year edition?
            The Definitive Edition
            Directorâ€™s cut?
        Wait why are we talking about MHW again?
I think it was good just criminally short. As short as the original but without the replay ability
I enjoyed it for what it is. I wish they had diverted money from the multiplayer mode to the singleplayer game, though, or even to a straight-up mercenaries mode.
Thank you! You could create a whole environment with water based monsters you could have crabs and sea serpents you could even create new fish type monsters as well and on the surface of the swamp land you can still have monsters who thrive in wetland or marshy environment it could open possibilities for movement or restrictions of movement and even new blight mechanics.
    do you really want Plessy back?


like, really?


*gets hipchecked from miles away*
        Well hopefully theyâ€™d fix the hit boxes and I mean pickles hipcheck has some bullshit as well
            i rarely fought Jho myself, but Plessy gave me nightmares. i remember almost throwing my PSP due to them hips...
