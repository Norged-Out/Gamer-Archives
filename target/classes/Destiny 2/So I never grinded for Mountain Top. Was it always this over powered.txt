[[So I never grinded for Mountain Top. Was it always this over powered]]





It was always a good weapon and now it is actually stronger I would argue. 

Thos this is in patrol on lost sector boss  ( also recombination goes brrrrr ) so no wonder it one hit him.
    I feel like it‚Äôs weaker now since we have so many strong options in the kinetic slot. Way back then nothing could top it, fusions were locked to energy, most breech loaders back then were not as good and not as common. (The only kinetic breech I remember was from lake of shadows and that shit wouldn‚Äôt drop.)
        My comment was on it being "stronger" now than it was. ( other weapons getting better does not effect that statement ) 

If we are talking about other options even back then there were better options for Special weapons ( unless we are counting lunafaction/rally barricade shenanigans )
    Which perk IS IT the forth one ?
        Yes the 4th one ( bottom right selected ) basically on any kill that is not the weapon itself it grants you stack each stack is 10% damage increase for the next shot. ( consuming all stacks ) 

at 10x it is 100% and if you get enhanced version ( which you can in TFS for MT it is 100% at 8 stacks and maximum is 8 )
            Wow OK thank you for the explanation gonna keep an eye Out for a Roll
Choosing ambitious assassin over auto loading for a recombination roll is dastardly work
    Eh, I switched to auto loading holster as I thought it wouldn't proc too much as I would save it for the tougher enemies. But maybe I should try it out.
        Basically the schtick is to get 10 kills to max Recomb, swap to it, Recomb shot to nuke something, switch back, repeat without needing to reload the Mtop. You can even save it for shenanigans with a Bait and Switch heavy- charge Recomb, boss becomes vulnerable, shoot with the Primary, Recomb, unload BnS Heavy, repeat. If the Heavy has ALH or Envious too you never need to reload any of your weapons besides your primary.


If just do the primary-Mtop swap for Champs and other beefy targets.
            I like auto loading holster as a perk, but most of the time I end up not using it because reloading weapons (especially breech loader gls) hits a certain switch in my brain.
    Ambitious assassin Recombination is actually a roll im interested in, cause you get the recomb shot (200% dmg) + an unupgraded shot (100% dmg) so in high difficulty content you get a SUPER NUKE as opposed to a regular nuke of (200% dmg)

Here is the roll for reference.
    Definitely switch to auto loading. Switch back to other gun, kill a few things, and switch back to this. It‚Äôs such a fun method
    I hate you...
    That‚Äôs a single vorpal instead of harmony away from an absolute god roll on the double perks, fantastic
    I hate you
    shard


edit: whoa, that's a lot of downvotes! All I meant is it's a garbage roll and OP should delete it
        Your mom should've sharded you.
            That coming from a chibi Nijika pfp has sent my sides into orbit
            Can I get a sharded as well?
                Reminds me of that interview where the dude is like "do you think abortion should be legal?"

Girl responds "definitely, I sometimes wish I was aborted."
        "Shard cause its not a perfect 7/7 shiny god roll!!1"

Ambitious + Recomb is goated. "it doesnt have spike nades!" shut mouth.
            I mean it's literaly a 6/5 shiny roll, reload MW is technically not better than handling, but who cares. Implosion + confined is the highest dmg possible on MT and sticky is used for movement tech. You'd be hard-pressed to find a better roll if you tried
                üëÄ
Movement tech? What's this?
                    Basically, since you can now 'rocket-jump' with MT, using sticky nades you can hit yourself with up to 7 or 8 grenades at the same time, which launches you at speeds rivaling eager edge skating (without needing heavy ammo or shatterdive/well), both vertically and/or horizontally.
                        üòê

This is the first I'm hearing about any of this lol
                            Here's a [clip](https://youtu.be/-QywHLoX3r8) that shows it off pretty well!
This was done using the sunset mountaintop, once that gets un-sunset it's probably going to get stealth nerfed a bit, but the interaction will still be there ofc.
                                Damn. That's pretty cool
            sorry, it's a garbage roll on a garbage gun. Op should farm the obvious GOAT, Wild Style, when it's back in rotation
It used to be better in Crucible (where it one-shot with very high grenade velocity), but it's probably better as PvE gun on its own nowadays.

By that I mean: the gun has actual traits on top of its micro-missile nature, meaning it is stronger as a firearm in its own right. Mountaintop used to be overpowered in the past, due to it abusing the original version of the Warlock exotic "Lunafaction Boots." Lunafactions Boots used to automatically reload all your weapons every couple ticks, meaning that the single-shot nature of grenade launchers was completely mitigated and it was a Boss-DPS king.

That doesn't exist anymore, but now the gun has really good traits to make up for lack of synergy. Recombination specifically is what I'm hunting for.
    Thanks for the breakdown. I was lucky to get this. I had just completed the quest for both forbearance and mountain top and when I turned them in I got the set roll for each after focusing them. I grabbed the reputation engram right after and it gave me this.
        Make sure you say your prayers to RNGesus today, cause there are people desperately farming for the roll you have.
            I fully understand how lucky I was. Bungie likes rewarding players when they take breaks and come back.
Not quite. Old MT top didn't have recombination, so you wouldn't get shots this powerful at all
What made it good was the autoloading from Luna factions wells and rally barricades, if that was still in the game the new version would be the superior one
    You can get the old one from the kiosk in the tower between the two vault terminals. It is fairly expensive to buy but you can get the original one.
        I meant the auto loading, not the old version
            Ah
                What they're referring to here is the fact that Rally Barricades and Lunafactin Boot Rifts/Wells *reloaded for you*. So the DPS meta was literally just combine Barricades/Lunas and shoot Mountaintop because you straight up did not have to reload.

Now Rally Barricade and Luna Boots only buff reload speed, instead of removing your need to manually reload.
I think you might want a better test than a year 2 lost sector boss.
    So what would be a good damage test? The first boss in the avarice dungeon?
        That‚Äôs always a good option for damage number testing, but even a strike boss from some of the recently added strikes like hypernet current or a boss from coil or rivens lair would work for seeing how much that type of weapon does against non endgame bosses that still have a health pool that can‚Äôt be deleted with primary
            I will definitely give it a try, thanks
                Glad I could help.
        I always test things in nightfalls master/GM, the first part always has enemies, any weapon used below master is "OP"

There's the first checkpoint in breakneck story mission on legend too
it's a lost sector boss anything would 1 shot it
Used to be much stronger, but current does more damage. The meta of Mountaintop, Recluse, Anarchy persisted for years for a reason.
Old MtTop with lunafacs, or rally baricade was definitely more broken
No. It was actually even *more* OP than this, and some people consider it to be the biggest reason, if not *the* reason, for sunsetting.
I‚Äôm using a demolitionist/rampage roll with ashen wake. Splosions go brrrrrr.
It used to be godly, you‚Äôre in a lost sector tho. Things die fast
People forget that mountaintop was the top dps weapon in the game because of lunafaction wells. You just drop anarchy mines on the boss and spam your full auto mountaintop. It made gahlran a meme
whats the roll
    Scroll down, it was posted.
