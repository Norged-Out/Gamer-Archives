[[From Lance’s wife, Stephanie 3]]





Kinda insane that she specifically thanked us out of all the communities he played a role in and who i imagine are also paying tribute. Sometimes this place ain't so terrible, we will forever remember you commander o7
    For every person making death threats against the devs, theres a guy doing raid sherpa's and teaching people how to enjoy this game despite its flaws.
        EDIT: NOT THE DEATH TREATHS NOT THE DEATH TREATHS OMG

                        Only the internet! Lol!!!
                    That’s a lot of coke for jijing bing
            In all seriousness, I appreciate people like you teaching others. I did a lot of VOG teaching in year one and now that I'm washed up it makes me happy to see the "willing to teach" in the sea of "kwtd"
                Best/worst experience was once where i had to dual wield languages while teachin oryx. Big mess but big fun lol
                Ok, but can they teach me vow

meesa haven’t done dat one yet
                    If h keep up with the jar jar speak then maybe...
            Lmaoooo
            That misunderstanding is quite hilarious.
            Not the silver bruh plz ![img](emote|t5_2we4j|5649)

            How about Death Treaties?
        Every time the community shenanigans gets me down, I try to remind myself that Goose is out there somewhere getting as many people Divinity as he can.    
    
There's still some good eggs in this community.
            Is that the dude with a bot set up to tell him when people are doing div runs and will join if someone leaves? Had that happen my div run, dude had 4K sherpas. Made the entire div puzzles so easy. Got to the final boss and 4 of us had never done it. Dude was just like “I don’t feel like explaining this. You two are team 1, you two are team 2, other dude that’s done this you’re with me on repairs. Just listen for my call outs, let’s go.” Got it first try. And all of this because he wants to get everyone div so no one ever runs the raid again because he despises it. Absolute legend
                > And all of this because he wants to get everyone div so no one ever runs the raid again because he despises it.

Damned spite is one hell of a motivator.
                    It really god dam is…A mixture of extreme hate for the raid and seeing hundreds of ppl get stuck on GoS every day for hours. Like it just sucks….

I might just go back to make a video for GoS ppl really struggle on it but there are some tricks that make it fairly simple for anyone to do.
                "He despises it"! ! ! woah, now THAT is a man on a mission.
                Is there a way to get in contact with him? I need help to get it for my clan mates
                    Cant even remember the guys name tbh, he just joined randomly after one of our guys quit halfway through, before we could find a new 6th. told us he has a bot set up to literally scan for people doing div runs and ping him if someone in said runs quits.
                        Absolute madlad lol
                Yep div bot.

I really do despise that raid….I will put it into the ground.

No but if they fixed the loot table to make it more enticing and fixing bugs I would only…somewhat hate it…instead of my want to see GoS burn to the ground…(Mechanics are just to dull and interesting to me.)
            He (Goose) actually got me Xenophage.
                Goose is to good for this community.
            Get off the internet and you will realize 99% of people arent bad apples but the 1% vocal minority that people for some reason give attention to.
                Social media and its consequences
            There's an entire discord out there full of sherpa getting people divinity. I only found out maybe a month and a half ago!

Edit: ~~https://discord.gg/756QngAV~~
                Whats the discord, i could help sherpa some people
                    Doin' the Traveler's work.
                I would love to join that! What’s the name?
                Could you let me know the name? I still need to get mine one day
                Says the link doesnt work
                    Hence the strike through
                I would also very much like to know the name of said discord
                Is there one for farming certain encounters of GoS?
                    I couldn't say
                Discord link is borked can you update plz
                    Can't unfortunately. The mods of the server contacted me and raged because they had no anti-bot or any sort of server security in place so they got swarmed by bots. I got banned and the link deactivated.
                        Wow
                            Well, they told me it was a public server so :/
                                So much for that
                                Do you have the name still at least?
                                    [deleted]
            There is a special place in my heart for guys like that. It resonates with my character. I only wish I was where I needed to be to even try being a sherpa for others.
                Well brother real talk when I started all of this (10 years ago) I never thought I would be able to help anyone. I was going through some really dark shit and had a lot of issues in my life.

But I loved playing destiny to get my mind off of things and fell in love with Gladd. The man became my idol of sorts and was able to make me laugh and mystified at how amazing of a personality and player he was.

I never thought I would low man a raid; but eventually did. I never thought I would do a low man flawless; but I eventually did. I never thought I would actually do a day 1; but I eventually did. 

Hell I never thought I would get over depression and be able to lead or talk to ppl. But in the game I have lead thousands of ppl and real life I lead meetings/other programmers pretty dam well with kindness and try to always keep everyone laughing and smiling while we work. (I am certainly not a perfect person and like anyone I have my good and bad days. Just important to know how to recover from the bad days.) 

Truthfully it was just about getting out of my comfort zone and trying new shit.

Honestly give it a shot you don’t know what you can do until you take that first step. (I know it sounds corny as f*** but it’s true.) 

I might make a video talking about all my Sherpa strategies and how I structure things.
                    Thank you for the candid and cogent reply. I have backed off a bit from Destiny 2 to get some things in life in order; IRL. I also need to get a new computer in order to play D2 well. I used to be in a clan and play in fireteams and had friends and we would hang out in our Discord channel and it was so good. Been lonely since. Hoping to get to a point again where I can be an active player in teams instead of solo stuff. I have recently got my brother into it so that has been fun carrying him through the old campaigns from the Witch Queen and back.
                        That’s fair. Real life shit > Destiny. 

I personally would suggest Toadsmoothie discord for meeting new ppl. A good amount of them are nice and chill ppl. You and your brother might find some nice ppl there. 

I joined awhile back when he solo prophecy for his gf so she could get that cute ghost cat thing.(Which I thought was adorable.) I wanted to get him div because I thought that was to dam cute.
                            thanks. will check that out when I get back into it.
            Aww Holly shit man thanks. Just was having a shit day stuck in bed coding (threw my back out at the gym the other day…my kettlebell swing form needs work…ow lol)

But I appreciate the love man.
        If you have a chance this weekend hang around the Cosmodrome and help new lights.

I was doing bounties today and saw a couple of titans trying to protect a warsat and getting pushed out by the wizards. I went around did my stuff and ran into another new light in the same situation. 

Do it for the Lance and Commander Zavala. You also just look badass. To them I came out of nowhere dropped a rift and made everything explode within moments.
            I regularly go to Cosmodrome for my dailies that don't require specific places to clear. There's a certain kind of fun watching new lights learning the ropes and stepping in when it gets too overwhelming.
                I tend to head there with Lumina and BotA running Well and Healing Nades. When I have weapon requirements, I switch it up to The Stag.
            I am so doing this. Brilliant .
            Always go there for gunsmith bounties. Just hang about, get shot at because they don't understand how the seemless mp works, flex the drip, point to gold chests etc
        I feel so happy because I accidentally ended up teaching a couple really nice guys how to do Duality the other day. They learned surprisingly fast so I may have been getting pranked but I don't care
            I just learned duality a couple day's ago and it was fairly easy to pick up so doesn't have to be a prank
            Check out dungeon.report (search for that in google) and you can pull up your individual clears from it... find the clear with the two you cleared it with and can see how many clears they as well have.
            Most of the dungeon mechanics are pretty easy to get the hang of
        I'm genuinely sorry to ask this here but any tips on where to find people like that please? I started a month ago, i'm super confused about endgame, gearing and getting into raids, i mostly just did campaigns and sidequests to boost my season pass. I wanna invest myself in the game further, but it's so overwhelming and confusing. Any tips welcome!
            Feel free to ask or pm and I'll do my best to help you out, since no one else seems to be stepping up to the plate. If your really interested me and a couple others have a discord (there's like 6 of us) I can get you in
                I'm in the same boat can you send me the discord link?
                Sorry for the late response, EU timezone here. Don't want to intrude in a private group as i'm not confident in my gameplay at all yet. Appreciate the offer!

My power seems to have come to a halt at 1770 and i can't figure out how to keep increasing it. Season pass asks that i do legend lost sector and some quests want me to do nightfall playlist but both content are crazy hard and i do not contribute. I'm also confused about gearing in general as i don't think the game ever explained how i  can identify which legendary weapon or armor i should keep and use or not.

My goal is raids at some point but i don't wanna get carried through it specifically, rather understand how i can get to there and how to gear for it correctly.
                    Power level gets stuck at around 1770 is because you are not doing powerful content. Basically, content that rewards u powerful gear (golden symbol thingy, these are weeklies. You can google what is the power level cap and etc, and how to power level yourself.

In terms of raids, dungeons or others, you can join a sherpa group or the LFG discord to find people to sherpa you across content. This is when they teach you how to do the raids and dungeons, so that in the future you are able to do them by yourself without needing a sherpa (with 5 other players, of course.)
                        Cool thank you, i'll try to get that powerful gear then and look for a group to help out. My confusion also comes with the various stats and elements related to mods and damage type. Gear is overflowing but i don't have the correct understanding of what to keep and use for which content and it's frustrating.
                            It takes time to understand for sure, destiny has to be one of the most non-newplayer friendly games ever.

elements for guns determine, obviously, the element of what you are shooting. For low/early game content, it doesnt really matter since u will pierce the shield no matter what. But moving to high tier content, different elements break different shields. This can be seen from the color of the shields matching the color of the elements, purple shields being void, blue shields being arc and orange shields being solar. 

Having the wrong elements means you don't do as much damage as compared to breaking the shield with the **CORRECT** element. This specific modifier is called match-game iirc.

Elements dont matter unless you do specific builds i would say? or use the weapon damage boost mods on your legs. Some elements also serve to enhance builds, specifically in this season, its all void weapons. You would have noticed that in your seasonal artifact (thing below your ghost), there is a perk on the middle tree at the bottom, which grants volatile rounds (one of the most broken rounds/perks for any weapon rn.) to any void weapon. 

Kinda getting ahead of myself. TLDR; shields have different elements, look at color. if match game is active in end game content (90 if not 100% of the time it is active), shields can only really be penetrated by the same element, or else it takes too many shots to break. 

exception to match game is adaptive munition, where guns do increased damage to all shield types.
                                also mods are important for builds and ETC, there are a couple of good guides out there for mods in lightfall since they redid the mods during lightfall. If you want, you could DM me and i could send you a couple of videos explaining them, along with some builds
                                    Thank you so much, that was very insightful! I'm on mobile rn but will definitely DM for videos later.
            Hey you can shoot me a PM if you need any help with certain content or need tips.
            r/destinysherpa
                Appreciated!!
        I don’t understand why more people can’t be like that. I never knew how badly people thought of destiny before it started popping up on my twitter. Yea there are flaws but everything in life has flaws. The game is very fun and more people should experience it imo
        Yeah I think death threats are just a part of Twitter lol
        I’m a 32 year old single dad. I don’t get much time to get online and raid. There’s this group of dudes who I met through lfg years ago. We don’t talk much but whenever a raid comes out they shoot me a message and offer to help me through it. I’ll admit for the most part my public destiny experience is toxic, but there’s some good people out there.
        Who's this name? This Guardian must be known!!
        Idk if that's the 1:1 ratio you want to propose
        Yep.  I don't play anymore but I'll always remember the raid sherpas who were insanely patient, calm and encouraging when they took me and 3 others through the Vault of Glass the first time.  Just incredibly nice people.  Nor will I forget the random raid parties I hopped on in D2 and how silly and hilarious they were.  Team wipe?  Someone had already had a joke in the chamber.
        there are people making death threats?
        I'm sorry. DEATH THREATS?
            Some people are fucking weird bro.
                Death threats were barely reasonable when directed at blood and honey, but against the devs of Destiny??? Christ almighty
                    Yeah- again, people are freaks. But with how many people play this game, and how its free to try, some of the worst end up playing it.

But for every piece of ahit, theres 20 people oppositely good
        4 and a half hours last night telling those blueberries they would see Nezarac go down and I believed in them when I very much did not.
        I'll never forget the time I got my friend (back) into d2. It happened to be during those 4 or 5 days where the apps were down cause they were messing with the API, so everyone had to go to the tower to open their vault.

We load into the tower, and some blueberry uses the fist bump emote on him. Then my friend went to a vault kiosk to see what exotic weapons he still had in there, and stops when he sees probably 7 people lined up in front of the vault, like it happens sometimes. He goes "They're in line?!?! This is nothing like the league community" (the game we had just been playing).
        This made me tear up. Also I think the sherpas are 10 to 1 on the toxic people
    I mean, he really cared about this game, and apparently the people who played it as well. 

[The full post on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cp8CBr3oDC_/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=)had 3 pics of Lance, two of which were black and white, one in color, and Zavala. 

Not Charon from John Wick, not Thordac, not any of his more popular or well known roles. Zavala. Someone who he only lent his voice to. I don't think it's a stretch to say that he loved Zavala more than most of his other ones, and while so many other voices left for one reason or another, he stayed on, because he loved it.
        Agreed, it's pretty clear he had a special place in his heart for Zavala. Through his mastery of the role and interaction with the community, he carved out a special place in our hearts too. I can't begin to speculate on what Bungie will do moving forward, but if they choose to have Zavala martyr himself to save all of us (which I hope they'll do), my eyes will not be dry. Even if they change voice actors, it'll choke me up. Standing in the tower with Zavala and hearing his voice makes it feel like Lance is still here in some way and when that goes away, it'll take away a character that has dominated my gaming hobby for a long time.
        I heard he was a fan of the game as well as being in it. Likely was a project he was passionate and engaged with.
            It was pretty clear he was paying attention to the community and really cared about the game.  I think he did a few Destiny meme posts.  Not to mention he went on recording for the game through COVID lockdowns.
                I think when you read between the lines, he made some sacrifices to keep voicing Zavala. There's a reason nearly every major VA other than him has been replaced over the years.
                    Which other VA got replaced?  I thought it was just Nathan Fillion being replaced by Nolan North for Cayde shortly before he died (and I suppose Peter Dinklage being replaced by Nolan North).
                        Nolan North replaced Nathan Fillion as Cayde  
Nolan North replaced Peter Dinklage as Ghost  
Mara Junot replaced Gina Torres as Ikora  
Erika Ishii replaced Jamie Chung as Ana Bray  
Moira Quirk replaced Lauren Cohan as Elsie Bray

Also Bill Nighy and Peter Stormare are were just written out
                            Thank you.

I thought they sounded different, but for some reason I couldn't find anything on the VA change.
                        I guess ikora got replaced but it's just some comment I read. They said Lance was the last original vanguard left.
                Lol he made a entire new voice line for the cabal cutscene cause people asked for it
            He played as a warlock pretty regularly. He would also, almost always, reveal on social media when he was recording for Bungie. It's say he loved this game and community. I don't know how Bungie is going to handle this with final shape already in the works. I don't think there is any way they can replace him like they did other actors.
            He even did a Cameo video as Zavala for someone
                He actually did several meme videos for free too
                He did one for Leopard, at least. Mocked him for his endless number of open tabs. He genuinely seemed like a good guy.
RIP Commander.
        > Someone who he only lent his voice to.

I'm a fan of the voice acting industry, and Lance is one of those guys that can literally act out his character's story and personality in full just with his voice alone.
        Dear god that post got me :(
            Me too, no lie.
                ![gif](giphy|l378giAZgxPw3eO52)
        Yeah he was a busy guy. To still go out of his way to voice Zavala after so many years makes it clear it probably became a bit of a passion project for him
    Dude no large news outlet recognized Lance’s roles in videogames, except the ones that are specifically for videogames. Amazing that his wife recognized the work he put 10 years into.
        I was about to say. Went through like 50 posts (on Twitter) paying respects to him, and literally everything they mentioned were his role in "John Wick" and some mentioned his role in "The Wire." Completely ignoring the fact that he played Zavala for a lot longer than any other role he ever had.
    I honestly don’t care about any other game, but Bungie and the Destiny community are one of the best and kindest gaming communities out there.

Yes there are bad times like the death threats, but when it comes to a specific cause, it’s the Destiny community that tries to go above and beyond for that.

I’ll honor lance reddick until the end of time
        The Destiny community is pretty great if you ignore the bad apples. 

Behind every level 1 guardian running around the cosmodrome, there’s two guys with 10,000 hours played in the game happily teaching him to spend all his free time fighting for the Traveler.
            i’m only 700 hours in but even i still love helping new guardians get their sea legs
            When I was really playing during COVID I think I did like 30 Sherpas and and pretty much most of my raids were teaching ones since some people would just tell first timers to just shoot add instead of actually teaching them and I probably was not even the highest Sherpa in my clan
        Back in Destiny 1, I always kept a set of very low-level armor and weapons on me when the game got stale. I would go to the Cosmodrome and shadow new players until they understood I was there to help. And sometimes, I would enter strikes. It would place me with new blueberries. After entering, I would switch to raid gear and baby them through, never dominating so as not to take all their kills or fun. Often, I'd get a message saying, "I know what you're doing, and thanks!"
Destiny has been the best gaming community by far.
Now Im a truck driver and only get to go home every couple of months. I haven't done any raids, and I don't have any friends in the game anymore. But I was trying to get the Gjallarhorn and could not solo Grasp of Avarice. I found the Discord Destiny LFG server and begged for a hand. A great guy jumped in with me and another newb. We were awful, but he stuck with us all the way through. Great guy.
Can't say enough about D2 players. For every toxic player, I've met 10 nice ones.
            That’s awesome. It’s like the ninja turtles meme with the mentor guiding the baby turtles with the turtles guiding the mentor years later. o7
            I would put D2 on the top for community, even over the vaunted FF14 community. The random acts of kindness I've experienced here has been quite the number.
    It’s not surprising considering the love Reddick had for the game and the community. 

I’m sure this would’ve been something Reddick would have wanted.

Best wishes to her and her family.
    Considering someone in another post someone found that he has over 2800 hours amongst the two games, she probably knew how much the game meant to him, and him to us.
    This place can be a fuck fest of toxicity but when push comes to shove we come out swinging with love for our peoples. Lance was one of us and we don’t let fellow Guardians go out without a huge bang. He’s been such a huge part of many of our lives for so long that it would be a great disservice to not honor him how we have been. 

Eyes up Guardians.
    What is the meaning of o7?
        Meant to recreate a salute. The 'o' is a lil head and the '7' is a raised and bent arm
            Oh shit, I’m dumb
                Thanks for asking so the rest of us didn't have to o7
                No worries dude, I’ve been thinking it’s a fist bump for a looooong time.
                Nah, you're not dumb. At least, not for this reason. It's a perfectly fair question to ask.
                    This whole time I thought it was a Bond reference, as in 007.... 

o7
            So an o/ or ol is ....
                it's yo/hi/howdy/whatev
        It's mimicking a salute.
    Look this game is a part of our lives as it was for Mr. Reddick. We now fight in his honor.
    He frequently played is why
    I paid tribute how i could, said my good byes to Zavala and saluted him.  RIP in peace.
    I watched the almost explosion of love, and homage. It made me love this game even more.
    Was thinking the same. Shes definately a guardian.

        Why u askin me? Idk. Also this isn't askin so much so as just aknowledging that donations can be made and if people wanna to go there. Idek if for the family or the town
        “MOMCares is an organization serving mothers and families, providing support, self care opportunities and healing experiences designed to strengthen the family unit with the matriarch at the center of its work. We are compassionate, trained advocates caring for moms and saving Black and brown lives. “

Asking for people to donate to charity in remembrance really doesn’t seem that odd
        She was talking about donating to that charity that Mr Reddick supported. As in, in lieu of flowers...
    As a Destiny 2 veteran who doesn't raid this game can be so much more fun without raids. Just saying I should be able to play the game how I want. Not how the game meta chooses how I get to play. It's my biggest issue with raids, "if you're not using the right set of weapons you're going to fail." Been playing since day one and I've done 5 raids, one of them twice. Just for divinity. Besides that it's too much hand holding a group working together and singing kumbaya around a campfire for me. Usually when I play Gambit I'm the MVP for both teams. 🤷

Like I said I have far more fun playing different activities than just raiding in six Man groups. 

I feel we should have six man teams no matter what. 

For any activity...

As a little bit of challenge or fun. Game doesn't have to always be about raiding. 

Reason my kd ratio is what it is... is because I like to play with new weapons or strategies. I don't care if they blow up in my face. It's all about fun & story to me.  If it's too hard or aggravating (cause I have issues with people in general.) I'll just wait till ebontis covers it on YouTube. 🤣 They're are certain things in life and in this game that I will avoid.

Personally trials are too sweaty less fun. 

And raids are too mechanic and talkative reliant. 

I've literally had people screaming at me over the guns I picked or how I did things. 

I'm totally good. I'll just tear ass in Gambit / Iron banner / Control 😂

Or spend hundreds of hours bouncing around on planets doing random patrols or killing mobs.

They're much more fun things to do in this game, than talk to people, I promise you 😘
        ....ooooooo-kay?
    Yo can you dm me you account banner? The image is sick
        Currently brushin my teeth to go sleep so either wait 7/8 hrs or (which i highly reccomend) look up D2 concept art. Very cool in general and easy to find thanks to gaming news outlets compiling them in article. My banner is one for the early ideas of the farm. Gl gamer or see ya later
            Yo thanks for the reply and the great options and hope you have a good rest

    Dude was literally playing Destiny 2 the night before he passed. What an absolute G Lance was. He didn't just do the role, he WAS the role. He embraced Zavala completely and loved being basically the leader of humanity when he put on that character. He wore Zavala like a set of titan armour and completely embraced him. When he was being Zavala you completely believed it, and had you hanging on every word he spoke.
i get a lump in my throat seeing his pics and words now. damn. RIP 🫡
    Grabbing vanguard bounties is an emotional challenge now
        I didn't do them before. I guess now I will.

"A Hollow man, leading others to die...for a silent god."

We did not follow a silent god, but the leader who through the uncertainty and pain, fought for everyone, every step of the way.

A silent God cannot give orders, a silent God cannot grieve with those who cry. A slient god cannot fight back and rally the people to never give up hope. Rest in peace Commander for we follow your orders until we are no more.

What a terrible day for rain.
            What a terrible day for rain indeed
                As a Vancouver resident.... it did not rain....

It's like the rain knew and just decided to shut up this week because there would be a different kind of downpour

![img](emote|t5_2we4j|5643)
            I mean, the Silent God did fight back and nearly killed itself in the process. We know now from extra raid lore that it released a gigantic blast of Light that practically ejected the Black Fleet from the galaxy, and buried Nezarec's pyramid a kilometer into the lunar soil from the sheer force (where Savathun then boarded the Pyramid and finished him off).

And then in its dying breath it released the Ghosts, to find people worthy of wielding the Light.

One of those Ghosts then found Lance Reddick, who died before his time many eons ago, and raised him as Zavala.
        I'm the opposite. Used to buy them from orbit via the app but now I go out of my way to go in person just to hear a voice line and see the tributes. Every tower instance I've been in since the news this week has had a vigil of guardians paying respects. So cool.
        I started a warlock a couple days ago and whenever I had to go to Zavala for bounties and quest progression and it was not easy. It's crazy how a person we never met has that kind of effect on us
        Zavala and strikes were my favorite part from the second I stepped into this game.
    Yeah, ngl I’m normally fairly indifferent when it comes to celebrities (don’t mean anything bad by it, but it’s the truth), but this one really hurt. 

I love his work; The Wire, Destiny 2, Horizon,… It’s such an immense loss.
        If you've never seen Fringe, it's a pretty great series that he was in as well.
            I’m so happy I’ve seen Fringe mentioned almost everywhere. 

I always felt it was such an under appreciated and unknown show to many. 

That’s where I was first introduced to Lance, and then watched the wire.    May his memory live on through the greatness he was apart of.
                I love Fringe! I used to watch it on TV, then bought all the blu-rays and recently I have been watching it on HBO max. It’s a hidden gem for me but can be a hit or miss, one of my sisters love it, the other one thinks it’s meh. Lance was absolutely brilliant in it! >!He plays all his versions of Broyles with so good!<
            He’s also incredible in Bosch
            Fringe was what x files wasn't, amazing.
            I'm literally in the middle of watching "Corporate" and I'm not sure I can finish it. Hard to laugh at it now. :/ Just started watching a couple weeks ago and was so surprised and psyched when Sylens walked on screen as the CEO.
            French fried fringe Friday! Me and my buddy would get some burgers and fries and watch fringe every Friday. Love that show.
        My wife was rewatching the Blacklist last night and Lance had a very brief part as one of the main character's colleagues. Made me realise just how much stuff he was in.
        I first saw him in Lost, then the Wire. When I started playing Destiny I was so psyched. He was incredible in everything he was in, but his unique way of speaking  and top-notch acting worked so well for Zavala.

I've donated to the charity. I hope it's something he cared about. I know he cared about Baltimore, and supporting mothers in need is a good cause anyway. RIP Commander.
        I only ever knew him as Zavala, it was always amazing hearing him in movies and making the connection.

He took a character that would otherwise be so bare-bones and made him into a father, leader, and guardian; destiny, and the entertainment business as a whole is a lot smaller now
    Especially considering Zavala will occasionally say “Farewell”.
    Hol' up! When did he die?
        Yesterday :(
    Sometimes, when I go to Zavala and then leave his interaction screen, he will say farewell. This had me in tears yesterday.
Indeed. 

Whether we wanted it or not, we are all Titans today.
    Ironically enough the titan commander himself played a warlock in game. But let's just honor him in general. Not saying this to say we aren't titans but it's just a neat fact.
        Someone found his gamer tag and apparently he had been playing Titan for the last year. He was on Calus on legend the night before he passed.
            That just makes it worse!  😭😭😭
                Apparently he only did a raid in D1 too😭
            All I'm saying tho when guardian games roll around I ain't dunking shit since I play hunter. Titans deserve it this year
                I just play the game I'll end up literally anywhere, but definitely Dunkin with the titan this year
                make a titan and dunk it there, pretty sure you can do that
            He was playing on Legend difficulty? Man is the GOAT for real.
            you got a source for this? Would love to know this for sure
                [Front page on this sub.](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/11u89s5/lance_was_just_playing_last_nightdetails_in/)
                    Cool
    I’ve decided to show my Titan love, was a hunter main but until I complete beyond light, witch queen, and lightfall and reach the power cap on my Titan, I shall be a Titan main
I'm glad his family knows how much he meant to the community. Guess I'm crying today too...
Everytime I loaded into the tower Zavala was surrounded. I shedded a tear every time, may he R.I.P
    While he wasn’t surrounded, me and a random last night sat right in front of Zavala for a good 15-20min. We simply just sat there and Zavala looked at us the entire time, never turning around. Made it even worse knowing that Lance is gone, but never forgotten
    I try to start a ceremony yesterday when joining a new Tower. But sadly after switching several tower there's just no people joining me. Really want to participate in one.
[deleted]
    Now that is an actual good idea. Not like they don't do this on the regular. It would just be a matter of time since they'd have to make an item for it
        There’s no way it’s not coming. The charity is listed, the impact is undeniable. The community expects it. It’ll happen.
    I could see some armor based off of zavalas, though I’m not sure how that would work on warlocks or hunters. Maybe they get other Zavala based things.
        Each of the classes have a memory of Cayde class item
            Yeah, and that was only for the character being killed off. They should make "Memory of Zavala" class items for everyone, put it in Eververse, proceeds to charity.
                We do have the vanguard dere eververse armour that gives us Cayde-6's cloak for hunters. I don't know if the other classes have something similar
                    They are for previous notable members of that class, Wei Ning and Ulan-Tan. The Hunter one is actually Andal Brask's set, Cayde took his cloak after his death, and if you compare them Cayde's is slightly modified.
                        Mmm I see. Ye I know it's andal brask

                "Reddick's Lance" exotic glaive when Bungie?
            I could see them naming it based around his name like, Piercing Lance Cloak/Mark/Bond or something
                I saw an idea on the other subreddit (I think) for Reddick's Lance.
        Bro I’m on hunter and I don’t care if it wouldn’t look good, give me a big ass shoulder thing.
            The 1 time I think everyone would agree that asymmetrical armour would be a good thing
    That'd be a great idea. I would 100% pay for it.
    They could reprise the Jovian Guard armor set from Destiny 1 and bring it to D2. That armor was basically a player version of his armor.
    As long as they don't pull what happened with Shadow of War, where only a small percentage went to the family of a passed employee and the rest went to monolith. It was corrected, but it shouldn't have had to of been
        Bungie has been good about such things, iirc they even have their own charity for things like when they did things like the dog sitting emote
        God that was fucking terrible. It was a worldwide thing but only purchases from the US ( or even just select states) had a portion go to donations. I'd never heard anything about it being corrected so that's good at least.
            Yeah, iirc they made it so that 100% of what would be profit went to the guys family
    Im against buying eververse stuff, but I would buy that
    Someone mentioned a new legendary gear in honor of Lance Reddick(like a Memory of Cayde) and that might be a good idea as well.
    Great idea.
    Charities are run by people. And many people are untrustworthy, selfish pricks. Hence, many charities are bullshit. 

Nice that people are real quick to drop cash to a random organization when they think it’s for support of a person they are of a fan of but never met. No sarcasm, it’s a good thing, but weird and shortsighted. Some of us are on the right track I guess.
    I’m hoping they make an exotic to commemorate him and his character. Kinda like how they brought ace of spades back for Cayde.
    Nah gimmy a exotic weapon to purchase . Immortalize him but letting me run around blasting people with his gun
    Dropping the Zavala ornaments for the titan would be insane
I had a variety of experiences that lead me to stop playing the game 2019 after playing for about a year. When I picked it back up in late 2022, the community seemed to become more welcoming (as much as any online game can be). It’s nice to see this recognition. Lance meant alot to this community, and this community meant alot to him.
    I have had a love/hate relationship with the game since it was released... but Lance as Zavala was always a bright spot. One of the best of the voice actors, hands down, but his involvement with the community and obvious love of the game and character just endear him to me so much. His death hit me harder than I could have guessed.
    Yeah I remember when we all went ape shit when he read the altered speech in season of the chosen. It was nice having someone so integral to the game also meme around with us. Now if you excuse me, my Titan still needs to beat the campaign.
Man, it still doesn’t feel real. 

I’ll have to get back on later and stand watch again
    Currently alone in the tower making sure our man has company.
        Thank you for your service

        It’s not for them. It’s a charity that he would have wanted donations to incase people want to show support. Get your head out of your ass for long enough to do a little research before you make a fool of yourself smh
            I'll admit that I had similar knee-jerk thought at first before realizing it was a charity.

So long, Lance Reddick!
I’d really like Bungie Foundation to do something nice for him. I’d love to support it
    Same.
I hope Bungie makes some kind of set either just for Titans or adapt it to every class, and use all the proceeds for us buying it goes to his family
    Have Zavala’s face tattoos on a class item. 

City’s Lance Mark 

City’s Lance Cloak 

City’s Lance Bond 

>*”Whether we wanted it or not.” - Commander Zavala*
    I would proudly rock those ornaments.
    A glaive called Reddick's Lance... and just don't nerf it... ever.
Zavala dedicated emblem please bungie🙏🏾
    3rd page in the strikes tab for emblems have one that is his color scheme. “Push Forward” I believe
        The symbol is also in his shoulder pad
He literally played yesterday, we lost him so suddenly... It's heartbreaking.
Damn, this hurts...
Watching this while Journey played right on cue in game, thanks for all the memories Mr Lance o7
I love how she really just thank the Destiny fanbase you can see right there that the man LOVED and respect playing Zavala and even if I didn’t personally like Zavala I respect and love that man and how he played that character so perfectly RIP commander 🫡

(Hopefully this doesn’t get taken down) but We all loved and appreciated his work on this game and his body of work throughout the action #mayherestinpeace #EyesUpGuardian

    It will not be taken down. All love today.
Bungie better do a donation for emblem thing so we can let lances love of the game help with not only his funeral costs but to help those left behind.
Lost Legend that will never be forgotten
I’m so heartbroken over this, as is everyone else. Gonna miss him being alive. So sad. RIP, Commander.
Hopefully the Bungie team makes some sort of memorial in the tower somewhere...something that can be based in lore around his personal guardian character he played maybe.
Not a Destiny player but I saw this on r/all and just wanted to drop in to say RIP to a king. He was good po-lice, natural po-lice.
Dude was legit in every thing he touched
    Well said. Lance really was.
Damn bro I just didn’t expect it this is sad asf especially since he’s from my home city 😔
Don't mean to be that guy, but you got a source on this?

        “Breaks her silence…”

One damn day after his passing…. And they characterize it as ‘silence’. 

Entertainment journalists can really be parasites. What an unnecessarily sensational headline. I won’t give them the click.
        #tl;dr

Lance Reddick's wife, Stephanie Reddick, has made a statement on her late husband's verified Instagram account following his sudden death. She thanked fans for their love and support, calling him "taken from us far too soon." She also requested donations to be made to Mom Cares in Baltimore.

So long commander
Your watch has ended, commander. We'll take it from here. May you rest.
I don't normally get hung up on celebrity/actor deaths but Lance's passing fucking stings
When creating new lore for later expansions, they should add a titan named Reddick, maybe an auto rifle called Reddick's fury.
    Honestly I'd love if they made an exotic for this years Solstice of Heroes and dedicated it to Lance. It would fit since it's meant to honor and remember those who have defended The Last City.
I'm going to hard in guardian games for titan I love get this win for lance
    [deleted]
        Yes but for the past year, he's been playing only on Titan. And as our Commander, it only feels right (to me at least) to win it as a Titan
            He was a GUARDIAN
        He was a GUARDIAN
        Yea but voice actor is for zavalah a titan vanguard
I'm glad that it's times like these D2 players actually come together, lance will be missed very much.
Next raid boss is death itself. Let’s turn him into a gun and avenge Lance.
Bungie should make an exotic ornament in his memory for whatever exotic weapon he used the most. Then, as people were saying, make it an eververse purchase and donate the profits to the charity
    That would be my one and only eververse purchase
    His last load out he was wearing lion ramparts.
I’m not crying, you’re crying.
    I am fucking crying!
        Same :(
ts priceless n special that she mentioned us literally specifically
Im 27 years old and there are few times I have felt genuine dread for a celebrity dying and I was genuinely shook when I heard the news. You will be missed commander, see you starside
He's been an iconic voice to players for 9 years. I really hope there is some final recordings for him. It felt like we had so many more years with him.
Eyes up Guardians.
Eyes up, Guardian
Eyes up Guardian
What sucks even more is that you know the game is going to have to send him out in a blaze of glory
First time I visibly felt sick seeing the him in the news at work. Life is short
I'm usually not bothered by celebrity deaths but for some reason this one has me upset and genuinely saddened. Perhaps because I started to like his character in Fringe, and then in Destiny 2. But still...this is sad for sure.
Rest In Peace Commander. Hearing your voice on the tower is bittersweet. I will miss you.
My heart 😢
Not played Destiny but looked up articles about this. It’s pretty amazing. Also just makes you sad. He was on my short list of actors where if he was part of a thing, I was likely going to check out that thing. His taste in projects was spot on, he always brought his A game to every role. In interviews and the like he also just came across loving what he did and oddly in Hollywood that is a rare thing.
o7
He will forever be the our commander

 rest well lance
I started playing destiny in the beginning of COVID, only played a bit and just barely picked it up again this past December. I’d seen lance riddick in his previous work as most of us, but it just weird that I feel incredibly sad about this like it bums me out, maybe it’s because of constantly hearing him as Zavala but this man was hilarious and a terrific actor, seriously just taken too soon
Well shit I didn't know he was local to me.
I know it's silly bit was really disappointed that the bbc article on Lance's death didn't even mention Destiny and the love the community has for him. So very very happy to know that he knew how much we loved him
He deserves his own exotic imo. Call it the Shining Lance.
This one hit hard. I need answers .
He left a mark on my soul…I never met him, but know his work was worth viewing 🙏🏽 rest easy now
Had no idea he was married.  Pretty cool of his wife to post that.


Not a Destiny player, myself, but y’all have been great with this.  He was a great actor
Make a Statue of his Warlock, and throw it right beside Cayde. Dude deserves it.
Eyes up, Guardians!
Rest in peace Commander. o7
I don’t even play and this is making me well up with tears.
John Wick going to hit different now. 😔🙏
God bless him
I shed a tear when I heard the news
Beautiful.
Incredibly sad story, but kind of give me a little hope for humanity. The people showing love and paying their respects us genuinely heartwarming.
This is the only celebrity death that I actually teared up for. Sitting at the tower with other guardians all emoting to show our respect the best way we could, seeing hundreds of others posting online to do the same, just hit hard. Lance will be hugely missed.
Love this man and his family. Haven't picked up destiny in years but his role is what brought me to it. May be in poor taste but I wish it was levar Burton. Eyes up guardian.
Wow.. Sad, I really liked him. Amazing guy, superb characters,  roles...
Man he was fantastic actor this really pains me rip to a legend class and sophistication
keep your eyes up gaudians
Eyes up Guardian
Godspeed, you magnificent bastard!
Nice
Of all Lights, he shined brightest.
I just got back into d2 this past week and this has me crying
Thanks for everything, commander!
Crazy how all the issues with the game cease to exist in a moment like this. Embrace it
Heartwarming that she mentioned us, seems that sometimes our community isn't that bad. Our commander set an example of great moral character and now we just follow. o7
Per Audacia ad Astra Commander. Rest in peace
    Ok Lore Daddy 🤣
I saw a video today where he says that his favorite word was tits/titties and now I imagine Zavala saying "titties" the same way he says indeed
![gif](giphy|14jv8vrOdNlb4k)
I’m not ugly crying you’re ugly crying!
To the stars commander
It’s a terrible day for rain.
Lance was the only reason I watched The Resident Evil show, and was one of my favorite voice actors. I’m still in disbelief that he passed, it’s just so unexpected.
o7
I don’t even play Destiny anymore but wanted to say this is Amazing. RIP, Guardian.
He will always be my favorite actor.
<3 bless this man
🙏 ❤️
I needed this closure thank you 🙏
What happened?!!
    Died in his apt. I don't think the cause has been released yet
Imagine if she had capitalized Taken though
where’s his iconic slave role?!
Natural Po-lice
Does anyone know how a healthy 60 yo man just drops dead with zero explanation?!?!
    Heart attack, brain aneurysm.  These both happen to healthy people randomly
        Both happened to him?!?! Fuck sake!
            The actual cause of death hasn’t been released but those are causes of death that could happen to literally anyone regardless of health condition
            No.  I’m saying these could happen.  It was likely one or the other.


Cause of death other than ‘natural causes’ hasn’t been released
Is there a good guide for returning players?  I got really into D2 a couple of years ago, and when I recently tried to pick it back up again I was just completely lost, and I mean I was *significantly* more lost when I started the game from scratch originally.

I really wanna hop back in, but it was just an unpleasant experience when I tried, that I am kinda scared to without some kind of onboarding tutorial.
    Datto
boys its time to build a statue of Lance the size of that of Jesus in Brazil

    The donations won't go to her. MOMCares is a charity in his hometown for mothers in need.
        Still. Why? How is her husband passing away the appropriate setting for her to ask for donations to a completely unrelated cause?
            This is really common, as fans often want to help in some way. 

This way that generous fan energy gets channeled into something the celebrity would’ve supported instead of towards the family that is likely financially fine despite the obvious pain of mourning and loss.
                Yeah, I've noticed that in the US. Everytime someone passes there's an ask for donations through gofundme or other cause. It's sickening.
                    That's because funerals are extremely expensive for the average person. There's no obligation for anyone to donate. It's not "sickening" to ask for help when you need it, especially after a devastating loss.
                        It’s sickening that the situation in a country is such that its citizens are forced to do that in order to afford dying. That’s something not even people in third world countries have to do.
    Because it’s pretty common for people to ask to donate to a charity rather than buying flowers for a funeral.
Donations? 
From the D community?
Love the dude, and its super sad that he passed. I don't personally like seeing this though as that is actually my deadname. I really enjoy hearing all his voicelines, but its a mix of sadness and anger. Sadness for his passing and anger at my past. very conflicted to say the least...
If there's one person who's going to be immortalized as an AI voice actor, it's this man.
Donations???? He was a rich movie star donate your own fking money lady
    It's not for her. She just mentioned that for ppl who feel the need to be charitable in the face of death. Or like instead of sending flowers... Don't be an unnecessary jerk.
        Horse shit it’s a money grab like everything else
            Well…I hope she doesn’t see your ass is part of the Destiny community, but I suppose there always has to be at least one needle dick.
                What’s the destiny community?
                    You are a 1 month old account
            > money grab

Damn greedy charities and shit
    Don't be toxic
Donations? Doesn't Reddit have rules against crowdfunding?

For all you know, that money could be going to **ME.** Or to **OP.**
    Its a legitimate charity....
Much love and thoughts go out to the family. RIP.
thoughts and prayers
That's awesome. 

Just donated what I can to help spread the light. rip commander.
i never watched the wire
never played destiny
never watched or heard anything he made

but i trust the collective passion that people have for this person and now i feel sad that he died.
    He had a very characteristic way of speaking, not the same as, but idealistically similar to Capt. Kirk. First time I saw him was in *Fringe* and I still enjoy mimicking his character because of the unique perfunctory way he would speak. I had no idea he was 60, I would have bet maybe mid to late 40's. I do recommend seeing something he was in, I'd recommend *Fringe* because the story is pretty cool, but really anything he was in pretty much encapsulates what he was like as an actor from what I've seen of him.
        Way better actor than Shatner ever was tho
            Leagues above Shatner. Although I sometimes wonder if the acting was more a sign of the times rather than a reflection of the actor's talent. Shatner wasn't a great actor imo, but he did have some decent moments. I imagine modern actors use past performances for inspiration for how they themselves could perform better.

What I mean is that while Shatner wasn't a top class actor, I think of his career as a building block used by other actors to perfect their own performances, like incorporating a specific speech pattern.

Mind you, these are my own naive assumptions, I'm not an actor by any means lol
Rest in peace Commander
What class did Mr Reddick play most?
    Warlock
    Warlock but Titan for the past year
RIP Charon
And people still think video games are “childish” or a lot waste of time. This is beautiful
Actually got a little bit emotional when I logged in last night and saw about 30 guardians kneeling in front of Zavala NGL
I am not ready to say goodbye, Sylens...
RIP Lance ❤️ the road ahead will be hard, but your light will be there with all us Guardians. Thank you for an amazing journey Commander. To the stars ❤️
Long live!
o7 Commander 😢

He was kinda like my video game dad in way. I'm sure I have others but I cant think of em.

All the TikTok things I'm seeing about his Zavala character have just been making me cry. 

I'm happy he's proud of me.
F
Didnt know he did another video game besides Horizon Zero Dawn until today. He will be missed. Once you heard his voice in anything, u knew at least his character would be top notch. 💔
Rest easy, Guardian
It's sad to see him go so soon. I will truly miss him and the amazing work he has done. 

Rest in Lance
Goodnight sweet prince
That's awesome. I'm glad the community rallier together to pay him respect.  I even logged in after not doing so for the past year to salute Zavala and pay my respects.
I sat with him with another warlock and just cried tbh. I hope he finds peace on the other side.
I cried for the first time over a celebrities death. I get choked up when I see posts like this - this is a first for me. This is tough..
Rip Lance man ❤️
R.I.P we are missing you 😢
Man I'm tearing up.
This one really bummed me out.  RIP.
I feel bad for even feeling bad as bad id because I never knew him  personally and his I feel horrible for the family  but damn this sucks for real imma really miss this man
Man it still hasn’t sunk in yet that we wont see anymore of our great commander
Rest in peace Commander Zavala o7
#goodluckcommander
The fact that he was so ingrained into his community as he was shows the class act he was. Thank you for going "off script" and delivering us "One Fucking Guardian". God bless his family.
He was loved so much by this community. All the emotes by Zavala the last couple days have made me get misty eyed several times. 

[https://imgur.com/cnc6yH3](https://imgur.com/cnc6yH3)

I hope he can see all this love from up above, RIP.
I ain't crying you are :'(.
It just doesn’t feel real. I hope bungie releases armor sets based on Zavala and donate the proceeds.
🥺🖤💚
Eyes up Guardian.

Even if you’re crying.
It must be very overwhelming for her knowing such a great number of fans from new generations are giving their respects from this community
Any new lights that are active between 8am and 3pm feel free to join me I will help in anyway I can

RIP king.  

Definitely one of my favorite actors/voice actors.
This sucks. I was so much younger when D1 came out. I’ll miss my friends and I stopping by Zalaval/Vavazala/Zalavalazal to pick up bounties. He was my favourite NPC. I wanted to see so much more of Zavala. I’ll cherish every footprint he left in this digital world but whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold. RIP Lance.
Rest in peace commander.
Donations to/for what though?
    It’s a charity that helps out struggling mothers and their families.

Sad moment
R.I.P A Legend
Hearing that he passed away was horrible news, it even made me come back to the game just to salute to Zavala for him
He will never be able to be replaced great man!!!
For every person making death threats against the devs, theres a guy doing raid sherpa's and teaching people how to enjoy this game despite its flaws.
    EDIT: NOT THE DEATH TREATHS NOT THE DEATH TREATHS OMG

                That’s a lot of coke for jijing bing
        In all seriousness, I appreciate people like you teaching others. I did a lot of VOG teaching in year one and now that I'm washed up it makes me happy to see the "willing to teach" in the sea of "kwtd"
            Best/worst experience was once where i had to dual wield languages while teachin oryx. Big mess but big fun lol
            Ok, but can they teach me vow

meesa haven’t done dat one yet
                If h keep up with the jar jar speak then maybe...
        Lmaoooo

        How about Death Treaties?
    Every time the community shenanigans gets me down, I try to remind myself that Goose is out there somewhere getting as many people Divinity as he can.    
    
There's still some good eggs in this community.
        Is that the dude with a bot set up to tell him when people are doing div runs and will join if someone leaves? Had that happen my div run, dude had 4K sherpas. Made the entire div puzzles so easy. Got to the final boss and 4 of us had never done it. Dude was just like “I don’t feel like explaining this. You two are team 1, you two are team 2, other dude that’s done this you’re with me on repairs. Just listen for my call outs, let’s go.” Got it first try. And all of this because he wants to get everyone div so no one ever runs the raid again because he despises it. Absolute legend
            > And all of this because he wants to get everyone div so no one ever runs the raid again because he despises it.

Damned spite is one hell of a motivator.
                It really god dam is…A mixture of extreme hate for the raid and seeing hundreds of ppl get stuck on GoS every day for hours. Like it just sucks….

I might just go back to make a video for GoS ppl really struggle on it but there are some tricks that make it fairly simple for anyone to do.
            "He despises it"! ! ! woah, now THAT is a man on a mission.
            Is there a way to get in contact with him? I need help to get it for my clan mates
                Cant even remember the guys name tbh, he just joined randomly after one of our guys quit halfway through, before we could find a new 6th. told us he has a bot set up to literally scan for people doing div runs and ping him if someone in said runs quits.
                    Absolute madlad lol
            Yep div bot.

I really do despise that raid….I will put it into the ground.

No but if they fixed the loot table to make it more enticing and fixing bugs I would only…somewhat hate it…instead of my want to see GoS burn to the ground…(Mechanics are just to dull and interesting to me.)
        He (Goose) actually got me Xenophage.
            Goose is to good for this community.
        Get off the internet and you will realize 99% of people arent bad apples but the 1% vocal minority that people for some reason give attention to.
            Social media and its consequences
        There's an entire discord out there full of sherpa getting people divinity. I only found out maybe a month and a half ago!

Edit: ~~https://discord.gg/756QngAV~~
            Whats the discord, i could help sherpa some people
                Doin' the Traveler's work.
            I would love to join that! What’s the name?
            Could you let me know the name? I still need to get mine one day
            Says the link doesnt work
                Hence the strike through
            I would also very much like to know the name of said discord
            Is there one for farming certain encounters of GoS?
                I couldn't say
            Discord link is borked can you update plz
                Can't unfortunately. The mods of the server contacted me and raged because they had no anti-bot or any sort of server security in place so they got swarmed by bots. I got banned and the link deactivated.
                    Wow
                        Well, they told me it was a public server so :/
                            So much for that
                            Do you have the name still at least?
                                [deleted]
        There is a special place in my heart for guys like that. It resonates with my character. I only wish I was where I needed to be to even try being a sherpa for others.
            Well brother real talk when I started all of this (10 years ago) I never thought I would be able to help anyone. I was going through some really dark shit and had a lot of issues in my life.

But I loved playing destiny to get my mind off of things and fell in love with Gladd. The man became my idol of sorts and was able to make me laugh and mystified at how amazing of a personality and player he was.

I never thought I would low man a raid; but eventually did. I never thought I would do a low man flawless; but I eventually did. I never thought I would actually do a day 1; but I eventually did. 

Hell I never thought I would get over depression and be able to lead or talk to ppl. But in the game I have lead thousands of ppl and real life I lead meetings/other programmers pretty dam well with kindness and try to always keep everyone laughing and smiling while we work. (I am certainly not a perfect person and like anyone I have my good and bad days. Just important to know how to recover from the bad days.) 

Truthfully it was just about getting out of my comfort zone and trying new shit.

Honestly give it a shot you don’t know what you can do until you take that first step. (I know it sounds corny as f*** but it’s true.) 

I might make a video talking about all my Sherpa strategies and how I structure things.
                Thank you for the candid and cogent reply. I have backed off a bit from Destiny 2 to get some things in life in order; IRL. I also need to get a new computer in order to play D2 well. I used to be in a clan and play in fireteams and had friends and we would hang out in our Discord channel and it was so good. Been lonely since. Hoping to get to a point again where I can be an active player in teams instead of solo stuff. I have recently got my brother into it so that has been fun carrying him through the old campaigns from the Witch Queen and back.
                    That’s fair. Real life shit > Destiny. 

I personally would suggest Toadsmoothie discord for meeting new ppl. A good amount of them are nice and chill ppl. You and your brother might find some nice ppl there. 

I joined awhile back when he solo prophecy for his gf so she could get that cute ghost cat thing.(Which I thought was adorable.) I wanted to get him div because I thought that was to dam cute.
                        thanks. will check that out when I get back into it.
        Aww Holly shit man thanks. Just was having a shit day stuck in bed coding (threw my back out at the gym the other day…my kettlebell swing form needs work…ow lol)

But I appreciate the love man.
    If you have a chance this weekend hang around the Cosmodrome and help new lights.

I was doing bounties today and saw a couple of titans trying to protect a warsat and getting pushed out by the wizards. I went around did my stuff and ran into another new light in the same situation. 

Do it for the Lance and Commander Zavala. You also just look badass. To them I came out of nowhere dropped a rift and made everything explode within moments.
        I regularly go to Cosmodrome for my dailies that don't require specific places to clear. There's a certain kind of fun watching new lights learning the ropes and stepping in when it gets too overwhelming.
            I tend to head there with Lumina and BotA running Well and Healing Nades. When I have weapon requirements, I switch it up to The Stag.
        I am so doing this. Brilliant .
        Always go there for gunsmith bounties. Just hang about, get shot at because they don't understand how the seemless mp works, flex the drip, point to gold chests etc
    I feel so happy because I accidentally ended up teaching a couple really nice guys how to do Duality the other day. They learned surprisingly fast so I may have been getting pranked but I don't care
        I just learned duality a couple day's ago and it was fairly easy to pick up so doesn't have to be a prank
        Check out dungeon.report (search for that in google) and you can pull up your individual clears from it... find the clear with the two you cleared it with and can see how many clears they as well have.
        Most of the dungeon mechanics are pretty easy to get the hang of
    I'm genuinely sorry to ask this here but any tips on where to find people like that please? I started a month ago, i'm super confused about endgame, gearing and getting into raids, i mostly just did campaigns and sidequests to boost my season pass. I wanna invest myself in the game further, but it's so overwhelming and confusing. Any tips welcome!
        Feel free to ask or pm and I'll do my best to help you out, since no one else seems to be stepping up to the plate. If your really interested me and a couple others have a discord (there's like 6 of us) I can get you in
            I'm in the same boat can you send me the discord link?
            Sorry for the late response, EU timezone here. Don't want to intrude in a private group as i'm not confident in my gameplay at all yet. Appreciate the offer!

My power seems to have come to a halt at 1770 and i can't figure out how to keep increasing it. Season pass asks that i do legend lost sector and some quests want me to do nightfall playlist but both content are crazy hard and i do not contribute. I'm also confused about gearing in general as i don't think the game ever explained how i  can identify which legendary weapon or armor i should keep and use or not.

My goal is raids at some point but i don't wanna get carried through it specifically, rather understand how i can get to there and how to gear for it correctly.
                Power level gets stuck at around 1770 is because you are not doing powerful content. Basically, content that rewards u powerful gear (golden symbol thingy, these are weeklies. You can google what is the power level cap and etc, and how to power level yourself.

In terms of raids, dungeons or others, you can join a sherpa group or the LFG discord to find people to sherpa you across content. This is when they teach you how to do the raids and dungeons, so that in the future you are able to do them by yourself without needing a sherpa (with 5 other players, of course.)
                    Cool thank you, i'll try to get that powerful gear then and look for a group to help out. My confusion also comes with the various stats and elements related to mods and damage type. Gear is overflowing but i don't have the correct understanding of what to keep and use for which content and it's frustrating.
                        It takes time to understand for sure, destiny has to be one of the most non-newplayer friendly games ever.

elements for guns determine, obviously, the element of what you are shooting. For low/early game content, it doesnt really matter since u will pierce the shield no matter what. But moving to high tier content, different elements break different shields. This can be seen from the color of the shields matching the color of the elements, purple shields being void, blue shields being arc and orange shields being solar. 

Having the wrong elements means you don't do as much damage as compared to breaking the shield with the **CORRECT** element. This specific modifier is called match-game iirc.

Elements dont matter unless you do specific builds i would say? or use the weapon damage boost mods on your legs. Some elements also serve to enhance builds, specifically in this season, its all void weapons. You would have noticed that in your seasonal artifact (thing below your ghost), there is a perk on the middle tree at the bottom, which grants volatile rounds (one of the most broken rounds/perks for any weapon rn.) to any void weapon. 

Kinda getting ahead of myself. TLDR; shields have different elements, look at color. if match game is active in end game content (90 if not 100% of the time it is active), shields can only really be penetrated by the same element, or else it takes too many shots to break. 

exception to match game is adaptive munition, where guns do increased damage to all shield types.
                            also mods are important for builds and ETC, there are a couple of good guides out there for mods in lightfall since they redid the mods during lightfall. If you want, you could DM me and i could send you a couple of videos explaining them, along with some builds
                                Thank you so much, that was very insightful! I'm on mobile rn but will definitely DM for videos later.
        Hey you can shoot me a PM if you need any help with certain content or need tips.
        r/destinysherpa
            Appreciated!!
    I don’t understand why more people can’t be like that. I never knew how badly people thought of destiny before it started popping up on my twitter. Yea there are flaws but everything in life has flaws. The game is very fun and more people should experience it imo
    Yeah I think death threats are just a part of Twitter lol
    I’m a 32 year old single dad. I don’t get much time to get online and raid. There’s this group of dudes who I met through lfg years ago. We don’t talk much but whenever a raid comes out they shoot me a message and offer to help me through it. I’ll admit for the most part my public destiny experience is toxic, but there’s some good people out there.
    Who's this name? This Guardian must be known!!
    Idk if that's the 1:1 ratio you want to propose
    Yep.  I don't play anymore but I'll always remember the raid sherpas who were insanely patient, calm and encouraging when they took me and 3 others through the Vault of Glass the first time.  Just incredibly nice people.  Nor will I forget the random raid parties I hopped on in D2 and how silly and hilarious they were.  Team wipe?  Someone had already had a joke in the chamber.
    there are people making death threats?
    I'm sorry. DEATH THREATS?
        Some people are fucking weird bro.
            Death threats were barely reasonable when directed at blood and honey, but against the devs of Destiny??? Christ almighty
                Yeah- again, people are freaks. But with how many people play this game, and how its free to try, some of the worst end up playing it.

But for every piece of ahit, theres 20 people oppositely good
    4 and a half hours last night telling those blueberries they would see Nezarac go down and I believed in them when I very much did not.
    I'll never forget the time I got my friend (back) into d2. It happened to be during those 4 or 5 days where the apps were down cause they were messing with the API, so everyone had to go to the tower to open their vault.

We load into the tower, and some blueberry uses the fist bump emote on him. Then my friend went to a vault kiosk to see what exotic weapons he still had in there, and stops when he sees probably 7 people lined up in front of the vault, like it happens sometimes. He goes "They're in line?!?! This is nothing like the league community" (the game we had just been playing).
    This made me tear up. Also I think the sherpas are 10 to 1 on the toxic people
I mean, he really cared about this game, and apparently the people who played it as well. 

[The full post on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cp8CBr3oDC_/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=)had 3 pics of Lance, two of which were black and white, one in color, and Zavala. 

Not Charon from John Wick, not Thordac, not any of his more popular or well known roles. Zavala. Someone who he only lent his voice to. I don't think it's a stretch to say that he loved Zavala more than most of his other ones, and while so many other voices left for one reason or another, he stayed on, because he loved it.
    Agreed, it's pretty clear he had a special place in his heart for Zavala. Through his mastery of the role and interaction with the community, he carved out a special place in our hearts too. I can't begin to speculate on what Bungie will do moving forward, but if they choose to have Zavala martyr himself to save all of us (which I hope they'll do), my eyes will not be dry. Even if they change voice actors, it'll choke me up. Standing in the tower with Zavala and hearing his voice makes it feel like Lance is still here in some way and when that goes away, it'll take away a character that has dominated my gaming hobby for a long time.
    I heard he was a fan of the game as well as being in it. Likely was a project he was passionate and engaged with.
        It was pretty clear he was paying attention to the community and really cared about the game.  I think he did a few Destiny meme posts.  Not to mention he went on recording for the game through COVID lockdowns.
            I think when you read between the lines, he made some sacrifices to keep voicing Zavala. There's a reason nearly every major VA other than him has been replaced over the years.
                Which other VA got replaced?  I thought it was just Nathan Fillion being replaced by Nolan North for Cayde shortly before he died (and I suppose Peter Dinklage being replaced by Nolan North).
                    Nolan North replaced Nathan Fillion as Cayde  
Nolan North replaced Peter Dinklage as Ghost  
Mara Junot replaced Gina Torres as Ikora  
Erika Ishii replaced Jamie Chung as Ana Bray  
Moira Quirk replaced Lauren Cohan as Elsie Bray

Also Bill Nighy and Peter Stormare are were just written out
                        Thank you.

I thought they sounded different, but for some reason I couldn't find anything on the VA change.
                    I guess ikora got replaced but it's just some comment I read. They said Lance was the last original vanguard left.
            Lol he made a entire new voice line for the cabal cutscene cause people asked for it
        He played as a warlock pretty regularly. He would also, almost always, reveal on social media when he was recording for Bungie. It's say he loved this game and community. I don't know how Bungie is going to handle this with final shape already in the works. I don't think there is any way they can replace him like they did other actors.
        He even did a Cameo video as Zavala for someone
            He actually did several meme videos for free too
            He did one for Leopard, at least. Mocked him for his endless number of open tabs. He genuinely seemed like a good guy.
RIP Commander.
    > Someone who he only lent his voice to.

I'm a fan of the voice acting industry, and Lance is one of those guys that can literally act out his character's story and personality in full just with his voice alone.
    Dear god that post got me :(
        Me too, no lie.
            ![gif](giphy|l378giAZgxPw3eO52)
    Yeah he was a busy guy. To still go out of his way to voice Zavala after so many years makes it clear it probably became a bit of a passion project for him
Dude no large news outlet recognized Lance’s roles in videogames, except the ones that are specifically for videogames. Amazing that his wife recognized the work he put 10 years into.
    I was about to say. Went through like 50 posts (on Twitter) paying respects to him, and literally everything they mentioned were his role in "John Wick" and some mentioned his role in "The Wire." Completely ignoring the fact that he played Zavala for a lot longer than any other role he ever had.
I honestly don’t care about any other game, but Bungie and the Destiny community are one of the best and kindest gaming communities out there.

Yes there are bad times like the death threats, but when it comes to a specific cause, it’s the Destiny community that tries to go above and beyond for that.

I’ll honor lance reddick until the end of time
    The Destiny community is pretty great if you ignore the bad apples. 

Behind every level 1 guardian running around the cosmodrome, there’s two guys with 10,000 hours played in the game happily teaching him to spend all his free time fighting for the Traveler.
        i’m only 700 hours in but even i still love helping new guardians get their sea legs
        When I was really playing during COVID I think I did like 30 Sherpas and and pretty much most of my raids were teaching ones since some people would just tell first timers to just shoot add instead of actually teaching them and I probably was not even the highest Sherpa in my clan
    Back in Destiny 1, I always kept a set of very low-level armor and weapons on me when the game got stale. I would go to the Cosmodrome and shadow new players until they understood I was there to help. And sometimes, I would enter strikes. It would place me with new blueberries. After entering, I would switch to raid gear and baby them through, never dominating so as not to take all their kills or fun. Often, I'd get a message saying, "I know what you're doing, and thanks!"
Destiny has been the best gaming community by far.
Now Im a truck driver and only get to go home every couple of months. I haven't done any raids, and I don't have any friends in the game anymore. But I was trying to get the Gjallarhorn and could not solo Grasp of Avarice. I found the Discord Destiny LFG server and begged for a hand. A great guy jumped in with me and another newb. We were awful, but he stuck with us all the way through. Great guy.
Can't say enough about D2 players. For every toxic player, I've met 10 nice ones.
        That’s awesome. It’s like the ninja turtles meme with the mentor guiding the baby turtles with the turtles guiding the mentor years later. o7
        I would put D2 on the top for community, even over the vaunted FF14 community. The random acts of kindness I've experienced here has been quite the number.
It’s not surprising considering the love Reddick had for the game and the community. 

I’m sure this would’ve been something Reddick would have wanted.

Best wishes to her and her family.
Considering someone in another post someone found that he has over 2800 hours amongst the two games, she probably knew how much the game meant to him, and him to us.
This place can be a fuck fest of toxicity but when push comes to shove we come out swinging with love for our peoples. Lance was one of us and we don’t let fellow Guardians go out without a huge bang. He’s been such a huge part of many of our lives for so long that it would be a great disservice to not honor him how we have been. 

Eyes up Guardians.
What is the meaning of o7?
    Meant to recreate a salute. The 'o' is a lil head and the '7' is a raised and bent arm
        Oh shit, I’m dumb
            Thanks for asking so the rest of us didn't have to o7
            No worries dude, I’ve been thinking it’s a fist bump for a looooong time.
            Nah, you're not dumb. At least, not for this reason. It's a perfectly fair question to ask.
                This whole time I thought it was a Bond reference, as in 007.... 

o7
        So an o/ or ol is ....
            it's yo/hi/howdy/whatev
    It's mimicking a salute.
Look this game is a part of our lives as it was for Mr. Reddick. We now fight in his honor.
He frequently played is why
I paid tribute how i could, said my good byes to Zavala and saluted him.  RIP in peace.
I watched the almost explosion of love, and homage. It made me love this game even more.
Was thinking the same. Shes definately a guardian.

    Why u askin me? Idk. Also this isn't askin so much so as just aknowledging that donations can be made and if people wanna to go there. Idek if for the family or the town
    “MOMCares is an organization serving mothers and families, providing support, self care opportunities and healing experiences designed to strengthen the family unit with the matriarch at the center of its work. We are compassionate, trained advocates caring for moms and saving Black and brown lives. “

Asking for people to donate to charity in remembrance really doesn’t seem that odd
    She was talking about donating to that charity that Mr Reddick supported. As in, in lieu of flowers...
As a Destiny 2 veteran who doesn't raid this game can be so much more fun without raids. Just saying I should be able to play the game how I want. Not how the game meta chooses how I get to play. It's my biggest issue with raids, "if you're not using the right set of weapons you're going to fail." Been playing since day one and I've done 5 raids, one of them twice. Just for divinity. Besides that it's too much hand holding a group working together and singing kumbaya around a campfire for me. Usually when I play Gambit I'm the MVP for both teams. 🤷

Like I said I have far more fun playing different activities than just raiding in six Man groups. 

I feel we should have six man teams no matter what. 

For any activity...

As a little bit of challenge or fun. Game doesn't have to always be about raiding. 

Reason my kd ratio is what it is... is because I like to play with new weapons or strategies. I don't care if they blow up in my face. It's all about fun & story to me.  If it's too hard or aggravating (cause I have issues with people in general.) I'll just wait till ebontis covers it on YouTube. 🤣 They're are certain things in life and in this game that I will avoid.

Personally trials are too sweaty less fun. 

And raids are too mechanic and talkative reliant. 

I've literally had people screaming at me over the guns I picked or how I did things. 

I'm totally good. I'll just tear ass in Gambit / Iron banner / Control 😂

Or spend hundreds of hours bouncing around on planets doing random patrols or killing mobs.

They're much more fun things to do in this game, than talk to people, I promise you 😘
    ....ooooooo-kay?
Yo can you dm me you account banner? The image is sick
    Currently brushin my teeth to go sleep so either wait 7/8 hrs or (which i highly reccomend) look up D2 concept art. Very cool in general and easy to find thanks to gaming news outlets compiling them in article. My banner is one for the early ideas of the farm. Gl gamer or see ya later
        Yo thanks for the reply and the great options and hope you have a good rest
Star citizen gang
Dude was literally playing Destiny 2 the night before he passed. What an absolute G Lance was. He didn't just do the role, he WAS the role. He embraced Zavala completely and loved being basically the leader of humanity when he put on that character. He wore Zavala like a set of titan armour and completely embraced him. When he was being Zavala you completely believed it, and had you hanging on every word he spoke.
Grabbing vanguard bounties is an emotional challenge now
    I didn't do them before. I guess now I will.

"A Hollow man, leading others to die...for a silent god."

We did not follow a silent god, but the leader who through the uncertainty and pain, fought for everyone, every step of the way.

A silent God cannot give orders, a silent God cannot grieve with those who cry. A slient god cannot fight back and rally the people to never give up hope. Rest in peace Commander for we follow your orders until we are no more.

What a terrible day for rain.
        What a terrible day for rain indeed
            As a Vancouver resident.... it did not rain....

It's like the rain knew and just decided to shut up this week because there would be a different kind of downpour

![img](emote|t5_2we4j|5643)
        I mean, the Silent God did fight back and nearly killed itself in the process. We know now from extra raid lore that it released a gigantic blast of Light that practically ejected the Black Fleet from the galaxy, and buried Nezarec's pyramid a kilometer into the lunar soil from the sheer force (where Savathun then boarded the Pyramid and finished him off).

And then in its dying breath it released the Ghosts, to find people worthy of wielding the Light.

One of those Ghosts then found Lance Reddick, who died before his time many eons ago, and raised him as Zavala.
    I'm the opposite. Used to buy them from orbit via the app but now I go out of my way to go in person just to hear a voice line and see the tributes. Every tower instance I've been in since the news this week has had a vigil of guardians paying respects. So cool.
    I started a warlock a couple days ago and whenever I had to go to Zavala for bounties and quest progression and it was not easy. It's crazy how a person we never met has that kind of effect on us
    Zavala and strikes were my favorite part from the second I stepped into this game.
Yeah, ngl I’m normally fairly indifferent when it comes to celebrities (don’t mean anything bad by it, but it’s the truth), but this one really hurt. 

I love his work; The Wire, Destiny 2, Horizon,… It’s such an immense loss.
    If you've never seen Fringe, it's a pretty great series that he was in as well.
        I’m so happy I’ve seen Fringe mentioned almost everywhere. 

I always felt it was such an under appreciated and unknown show to many. 

That’s where I was first introduced to Lance, and then watched the wire.    May his memory live on through the greatness he was apart of.
            I love Fringe! I used to watch it on TV, then bought all the blu-rays and recently I have been watching it on HBO max. It’s a hidden gem for me but can be a hit or miss, one of my sisters love it, the other one thinks it’s meh. Lance was absolutely brilliant in it! >!He plays all his versions of Broyles with so good!<
        He’s also incredible in Bosch
        Fringe was what x files wasn't, amazing.
        I'm literally in the middle of watching "Corporate" and I'm not sure I can finish it. Hard to laugh at it now. :/ Just started watching a couple weeks ago and was so surprised and psyched when Sylens walked on screen as the CEO.
        French fried fringe Friday! Me and my buddy would get some burgers and fries and watch fringe every Friday. Love that show.
    My wife was rewatching the Blacklist last night and Lance had a very brief part as one of the main character's colleagues. Made me realise just how much stuff he was in.
    I first saw him in Lost, then the Wire. When I started playing Destiny I was so psyched. He was incredible in everything he was in, but his unique way of speaking  and top-notch acting worked so well for Zavala.

I've donated to the charity. I hope it's something he cared about. I know he cared about Baltimore, and supporting mothers in need is a good cause anyway. RIP Commander.
    I only ever knew him as Zavala, it was always amazing hearing him in movies and making the connection.

He took a character that would otherwise be so bare-bones and made him into a father, leader, and guardian; destiny, and the entertainment business as a whole is a lot smaller now
Especially considering Zavala will occasionally say “Farewell”.
Hol' up! When did he die?
    Yesterday :(
Sometimes, when I go to Zavala and then leave his interaction screen, he will say farewell. This had me in tears yesterday.
Ironically enough the titan commander himself played a warlock in game. But let's just honor him in general. Not saying this to say we aren't titans but it's just a neat fact.
    Someone found his gamer tag and apparently he had been playing Titan for the last year. He was on Calus on legend the night before he passed.
        That just makes it worse!  😭😭😭
            Apparently he only did a raid in D1 too😭
        All I'm saying tho when guardian games roll around I ain't dunking shit since I play hunter. Titans deserve it this year
            I just play the game I'll end up literally anywhere, but definitely Dunkin with the titan this year
            make a titan and dunk it there, pretty sure you can do that
        He was playing on Legend difficulty? Man is the GOAT for real.
        you got a source for this? Would love to know this for sure
            [Front page on this sub.](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/11u89s5/lance_was_just_playing_last_nightdetails_in/)
                Cool
I’ve decided to show my Titan love, was a hunter main but until I complete beyond light, witch queen, and lightfall and reach the power cap on my Titan, I shall be a Titan main
While he wasn’t surrounded, me and a random last night sat right in front of Zavala for a good 15-20min. We simply just sat there and Zavala looked at us the entire time, never turning around. Made it even worse knowing that Lance is gone, but never forgotten
I try to start a ceremony yesterday when joining a new Tower. But sadly after switching several tower there's just no people joining me. Really want to participate in one.
Now that is an actual good idea. Not like they don't do this on the regular. It would just be a matter of time since they'd have to make an item for it
    There’s no way it’s not coming. The charity is listed, the impact is undeniable. The community expects it. It’ll happen.
I could see some armor based off of zavalas, though I’m not sure how that would work on warlocks or hunters. Maybe they get other Zavala based things.
    Each of the classes have a memory of Cayde class item
        Yeah, and that was only for the character being killed off. They should make "Memory of Zavala" class items for everyone, put it in Eververse, proceeds to charity.
            We do have the vanguard dere eververse armour that gives us Cayde-6's cloak for hunters. I don't know if the other classes have something similar
                They are for previous notable members of that class, Wei Ning and Ulan-Tan. The Hunter one is actually Andal Brask's set, Cayde took his cloak after his death, and if you compare them Cayde's is slightly modified.
                    Mmm I see. Ye I know it's andal brask
            Proceeds to momcares.org
            "Reddick's Lance" exotic glaive when Bungie?
        I could see them naming it based around his name like, Piercing Lance Cloak/Mark/Bond or something
            I saw an idea on the other subreddit (I think) for Reddick's Lance.
    Bro I’m on hunter and I don’t care if it wouldn’t look good, give me a big ass shoulder thing.
        The 1 time I think everyone would agree that asymmetrical armour would be a good thing
That'd be a great idea. I would 100% pay for it.
They could reprise the Jovian Guard armor set from Destiny 1 and bring it to D2. That armor was basically a player version of his armor.
As long as they don't pull what happened with Shadow of War, where only a small percentage went to the family of a passed employee and the rest went to monolith. It was corrected, but it shouldn't have had to of been
    Bungie has been good about such things, iirc they even have their own charity for things like when they did things like the dog sitting emote
    God that was fucking terrible. It was a worldwide thing but only purchases from the US ( or even just select states) had a portion go to donations. I'd never heard anything about it being corrected so that's good at least.
        Yeah, iirc they made it so that 100% of what would be profit went to the guys family
Im against buying eververse stuff, but I would buy that
Someone mentioned a new legendary gear in honor of Lance Reddick(like a Memory of Cayde) and that might be a good idea as well.
Great idea.
Charities are run by people. And many people are untrustworthy, selfish pricks. Hence, many charities are bullshit. 

Nice that people are real quick to drop cash to a random organization when they think it’s for support of a person they are of a fan of but never met. No sarcasm, it’s a good thing, but weird and shortsighted. Some of us are on the right track I guess.
I’m hoping they make an exotic to commemorate him and his character. Kinda like how they brought ace of spades back for Cayde.
Nah gimmy a exotic weapon to purchase . Immortalize him but letting me run around blasting people with his gun
Dropping the Zavala ornaments for the titan would be insane
I have had a love/hate relationship with the game since it was released... but Lance as Zavala was always a bright spot. One of the best of the voice actors, hands down, but his involvement with the community and obvious love of the game and character just endear him to me so much. His death hit me harder than I could have guessed.
Yeah I remember when we all went ape shit when he read the altered speech in season of the chosen. It was nice having someone so integral to the game also meme around with us. Now if you excuse me, my Titan still needs to beat the campaign.
Currently alone in the tower making sure our man has company.
    Thank you for your service
Every cent helps.
I’ll take it you’ve never seen *The Wire.*
[removed]
    It’s not for them. It’s a charity that he would have wanted donations to incase people want to show support. Get your head out of your ass for long enough to do a little research before you make a fool of yourself smh
        I'll admit that I had similar knee-jerk thought at first before realizing it was a charity.

Have Zavala’s face tattoos on a class item. 

City’s Lance Mark 

City’s Lance Cloak 

City’s Lance Bond 

>*”Whether we wanted it or not.” - Commander Zavala*
I would proudly rock those ornaments.
A glaive called Reddick's Lance... and just don't nerf it... ever.
3rd page in the strikes tab for emblems have one that is his color scheme. “Push Forward” I believe
    The symbol is also in his shoulder pad

    “Breaks her silence…”

One damn day after his passing…. And they characterize it as ‘silence’. 

Entertainment journalists can really be parasites. What an unnecessarily sensational headline. I won’t give them the click.
    #tl;dr

Lance Reddick's wife, Stephanie Reddick, has made a statement on her late husband's verified Instagram account following his sudden death. She thanked fans for their love and support, calling him "taken from us far too soon." She also requested donations to be made to Mom Cares in Baltimore.

Stephanie Reddick, the wife of actor Lance Reddick, has posted a tribute on Instagram following the news of his death, thanking fans for their outpouring of love and support. Stephanie also announced that donations can be made to Mom Cares, which serves under-supported mothers in Baltimore with NICU experiences, including transportation, advocacy, and self-care opportunities. The 60-year-old actor starred in The Wire and the John Wick film franchise, and passed away from natural causes according to his representative.

Honestly I'd love if they made an exotic for this years Solstice of Heroes and dedicated it to Lance. It would fit since it's meant to honor and remember those who have defended The Last City.
[deleted]
    Yes but for the past year, he's been playing only on Titan. And as our Commander, it only feels right (to me at least) to win it as a Titan
        He was a GUARDIAN
    He was a GUARDIAN
    Yea but voice actor is for zavalah a titan vanguard
That would be my one and only eververse purchase
His last load out he was wearing lion ramparts.
I am fucking crying!
    Same :(
Ok Lore Daddy 🤣
Died in his apt. I don't think the cause has been released yet
Heart attack, brain aneurysm.  These both happen to healthy people randomly
    Both happened to him?!?! Fuck sake!
        The actual cause of death hasn’t been released but those are causes of death that could happen to literally anyone regardless of health condition
        No.  I’m saying these could happen.  It was likely one or the other.


Cause of death other than ‘natural causes’ hasn’t been released
Datto
The donations won't go to her. MOMCares is a charity in his hometown for mothers in need.
    Still. Why? How is her husband passing away the appropriate setting for her to ask for donations to a completely unrelated cause?
        This is really common, as fans often want to help in some way. 

This way that generous fan energy gets channeled into something the celebrity would’ve supported instead of towards the family that is likely financially fine despite the obvious pain of mourning and loss.
            Yeah, I've noticed that in the US. Everytime someone passes there's an ask for donations through gofundme or other cause. It's sickening.
                That's because funerals are extremely expensive for the average person. There's no obligation for anyone to donate. It's not "sickening" to ask for help when you need it, especially after a devastating loss.
                    It’s sickening that the situation in a country is such that its citizens are forced to do that in order to afford dying. That’s something not even people in third world countries have to do.
Because it’s pretty common for people to ask to donate to a charity rather than buying flowers for a funeral.
It's not for her. She just mentioned that for ppl who feel the need to be charitable in the face of death. Or like instead of sending flowers... Don't be an unnecessary jerk.
    Horse shit it’s a money grab like everything else
        Well…I hope she doesn’t see your ass is part of the Destiny community, but I suppose there always has to be at least one needle dick.
            What’s the destiny community?
                You are a 1 month old account
        > money grab

Damn greedy charities and shit
Don't be toxic
Its a legitimate charity....
He had a very characteristic way of speaking, not the same as, but idealistically similar to Capt. Kirk. First time I saw him was in *Fringe* and I still enjoy mimicking his character because of the unique perfunctory way he would speak. I had no idea he was 60, I would have bet maybe mid to late 40's. I do recommend seeing something he was in, I'd recommend *Fringe* because the story is pretty cool, but really anything he was in pretty much encapsulates what he was like as an actor from what I've seen of him.
    Way better actor than Shatner ever was tho
        Leagues above Shatner. Although I sometimes wonder if the acting was more a sign of the times rather than a reflection of the actor's talent. Shatner wasn't a great actor imo, but he did have some decent moments. I imagine modern actors use past performances for inspiration for how they themselves could perform better.

What I mean is that while Shatner wasn't a top class actor, I think of his career as a building block used by other actors to perfect their own performances, like incorporating a specific speech pattern.

Mind you, these are my own naive assumptions, I'm not an actor by any means lol
Warlock
Warlock but Titan for the past year
It’s a charity that helps out struggling mothers and their families.

    How about Death Treaties?
Every time the community shenanigans gets me down, I try to remind myself that Goose is out there somewhere getting as many people Divinity as he can.    
    
There's still some good eggs in this community.
    Is that the dude with a bot set up to tell him when people are doing div runs and will join if someone leaves? Had that happen my div run, dude had 4K sherpas. Made the entire div puzzles so easy. Got to the final boss and 4 of us had never done it. Dude was just like “I don’t feel like explaining this. You two are team 1, you two are team 2, other dude that’s done this you’re with me on repairs. Just listen for my call outs, let’s go.” Got it first try. And all of this because he wants to get everyone div so no one ever runs the raid again because he despises it. Absolute legend
        > And all of this because he wants to get everyone div so no one ever runs the raid again because he despises it.

Damned spite is one hell of a motivator.
            It really god dam is…A mixture of extreme hate for the raid and seeing hundreds of ppl get stuck on GoS every day for hours. Like it just sucks….

I might just go back to make a video for GoS ppl really struggle on it but there are some tricks that make it fairly simple for anyone to do.
        "He despises it"! ! ! woah, now THAT is a man on a mission.
        Is there a way to get in contact with him? I need help to get it for my clan mates
            Cant even remember the guys name tbh, he just joined randomly after one of our guys quit halfway through, before we could find a new 6th. told us he has a bot set up to literally scan for people doing div runs and ping him if someone in said runs quits.
                Absolute madlad lol
        Yep div bot.

I really do despise that raid….I will put it into the ground.

No but if they fixed the loot table to make it more enticing and fixing bugs I would only…somewhat hate it…instead of my want to see GoS burn to the ground…(Mechanics are just to dull and interesting to me.)
    He (Goose) actually got me Xenophage.
        Goose is to good for this community.
    Get off the internet and you will realize 99% of people arent bad apples but the 1% vocal minority that people for some reason give attention to.
        Social media and its consequences
    There's an entire discord out there full of sherpa getting people divinity. I only found out maybe a month and a half ago!

Edit: ~~https://discord.gg/756QngAV~~
        Whats the discord, i could help sherpa some people
            Doin' the Traveler's work.
        I would love to join that! What’s the name?
        Could you let me know the name? I still need to get mine one day
        Says the link doesnt work
            Hence the strike through
        I would also very much like to know the name of said discord
        Is there one for farming certain encounters of GoS?
            I couldn't say
        Discord link is borked can you update plz
            Can't unfortunately. The mods of the server contacted me and raged because they had no anti-bot or any sort of server security in place so they got swarmed by bots. I got banned and the link deactivated.
                Wow
                    Well, they told me it was a public server so :/
                        So much for that
                        Do you have the name still at least?
                            [deleted]
    There is a special place in my heart for guys like that. It resonates with my character. I only wish I was where I needed to be to even try being a sherpa for others.
        Well brother real talk when I started all of this (10 years ago) I never thought I would be able to help anyone. I was going through some really dark shit and had a lot of issues in my life.

But I loved playing destiny to get my mind off of things and fell in love with Gladd. The man became my idol of sorts and was able to make me laugh and mystified at how amazing of a personality and player he was.

I never thought I would low man a raid; but eventually did. I never thought I would do a low man flawless; but I eventually did. I never thought I would actually do a day 1; but I eventually did. 

Hell I never thought I would get over depression and be able to lead or talk to ppl. But in the game I have lead thousands of ppl and real life I lead meetings/other programmers pretty dam well with kindness and try to always keep everyone laughing and smiling while we work. (I am certainly not a perfect person and like anyone I have my good and bad days. Just important to know how to recover from the bad days.) 

Truthfully it was just about getting out of my comfort zone and trying new shit.

Honestly give it a shot you don’t know what you can do until you take that first step. (I know it sounds corny as f*** but it’s true.) 

I might make a video talking about all my Sherpa strategies and how I structure things.
            Thank you for the candid and cogent reply. I have backed off a bit from Destiny 2 to get some things in life in order; IRL. I also need to get a new computer in order to play D2 well. I used to be in a clan and play in fireteams and had friends and we would hang out in our Discord channel and it was so good. Been lonely since. Hoping to get to a point again where I can be an active player in teams instead of solo stuff. I have recently got my brother into it so that has been fun carrying him through the old campaigns from the Witch Queen and back.
                That’s fair. Real life shit > Destiny. 

I personally would suggest Toadsmoothie discord for meeting new ppl. A good amount of them are nice and chill ppl. You and your brother might find some nice ppl there. 

I joined awhile back when he solo prophecy for his gf so she could get that cute ghost cat thing.(Which I thought was adorable.) I wanted to get him div because I thought that was to dam cute.
                    thanks. will check that out when I get back into it.
    Aww Holly shit man thanks. Just was having a shit day stuck in bed coding (threw my back out at the gym the other day…my kettlebell swing form needs work…ow lol)

But I appreciate the love man.
If you have a chance this weekend hang around the Cosmodrome and help new lights.

I was doing bounties today and saw a couple of titans trying to protect a warsat and getting pushed out by the wizards. I went around did my stuff and ran into another new light in the same situation. 

Do it for the Lance and Commander Zavala. You also just look badass. To them I came out of nowhere dropped a rift and made everything explode within moments.
    I regularly go to Cosmodrome for my dailies that don't require specific places to clear. There's a certain kind of fun watching new lights learning the ropes and stepping in when it gets too overwhelming.
        I tend to head there with Lumina and BotA running Well and Healing Nades. When I have weapon requirements, I switch it up to The Stag.
    I am so doing this. Brilliant .
    Always go there for gunsmith bounties. Just hang about, get shot at because they don't understand how the seemless mp works, flex the drip, point to gold chests etc
I feel so happy because I accidentally ended up teaching a couple really nice guys how to do Duality the other day. They learned surprisingly fast so I may have been getting pranked but I don't care
    I just learned duality a couple day's ago and it was fairly easy to pick up so doesn't have to be a prank
    Check out dungeon.report (search for that in google) and you can pull up your individual clears from it... find the clear with the two you cleared it with and can see how many clears they as well have.
    Most of the dungeon mechanics are pretty easy to get the hang of
I'm genuinely sorry to ask this here but any tips on where to find people like that please? I started a month ago, i'm super confused about endgame, gearing and getting into raids, i mostly just did campaigns and sidequests to boost my season pass. I wanna invest myself in the game further, but it's so overwhelming and confusing. Any tips welcome!
    Feel free to ask or pm and I'll do my best to help you out, since no one else seems to be stepping up to the plate. If your really interested me and a couple others have a discord (there's like 6 of us) I can get you in
        I'm in the same boat can you send me the discord link?
        Sorry for the late response, EU timezone here. Don't want to intrude in a private group as i'm not confident in my gameplay at all yet. Appreciate the offer!

My power seems to have come to a halt at 1770 and i can't figure out how to keep increasing it. Season pass asks that i do legend lost sector and some quests want me to do nightfall playlist but both content are crazy hard and i do not contribute. I'm also confused about gearing in general as i don't think the game ever explained how i  can identify which legendary weapon or armor i should keep and use or not.

My goal is raids at some point but i don't wanna get carried through it specifically, rather understand how i can get to there and how to gear for it correctly.
            Power level gets stuck at around 1770 is because you are not doing powerful content. Basically, content that rewards u powerful gear (golden symbol thingy, these are weeklies. You can google what is the power level cap and etc, and how to power level yourself.

In terms of raids, dungeons or others, you can join a sherpa group or the LFG discord to find people to sherpa you across content. This is when they teach you how to do the raids and dungeons, so that in the future you are able to do them by yourself without needing a sherpa (with 5 other players, of course.)
                Cool thank you, i'll try to get that powerful gear then and look for a group to help out. My confusion also comes with the various stats and elements related to mods and damage type. Gear is overflowing but i don't have the correct understanding of what to keep and use for which content and it's frustrating.
                    It takes time to understand for sure, destiny has to be one of the most non-newplayer friendly games ever.

elements for guns determine, obviously, the element of what you are shooting. For low/early game content, it doesnt really matter since u will pierce the shield no matter what. But moving to high tier content, different elements break different shields. This can be seen from the color of the shields matching the color of the elements, purple shields being void, blue shields being arc and orange shields being solar. 

Having the wrong elements means you don't do as much damage as compared to breaking the shield with the **CORRECT** element. This specific modifier is called match-game iirc.

Elements dont matter unless you do specific builds i would say? or use the weapon damage boost mods on your legs. Some elements also serve to enhance builds, specifically in this season, its all void weapons. You would have noticed that in your seasonal artifact (thing below your ghost), there is a perk on the middle tree at the bottom, which grants volatile rounds (one of the most broken rounds/perks for any weapon rn.) to any void weapon. 

Kinda getting ahead of myself. TLDR; shields have different elements, look at color. if match game is active in end game content (90 if not 100% of the time it is active), shields can only really be penetrated by the same element, or else it takes too many shots to break. 

exception to match game is adaptive munition, where guns do increased damage to all shield types.
                        also mods are important for builds and ETC, there are a couple of good guides out there for mods in lightfall since they redid the mods during lightfall. If you want, you could DM me and i could send you a couple of videos explaining them, along with some builds
                            Thank you so much, that was very insightful! I'm on mobile rn but will definitely DM for videos later.
    Hey you can shoot me a PM if you need any help with certain content or need tips.
    r/destinysherpa
        Appreciated!!
I don’t understand why more people can’t be like that. I never knew how badly people thought of destiny before it started popping up on my twitter. Yea there are flaws but everything in life has flaws. The game is very fun and more people should experience it imo
Yeah I think death threats are just a part of Twitter lol
I’m a 32 year old single dad. I don’t get much time to get online and raid. There’s this group of dudes who I met through lfg years ago. We don’t talk much but whenever a raid comes out they shoot me a message and offer to help me through it. I’ll admit for the most part my public destiny experience is toxic, but there’s some good people out there.
Who's this name? This Guardian must be known!!
Idk if that's the 1:1 ratio you want to propose
Yep.  I don't play anymore but I'll always remember the raid sherpas who were insanely patient, calm and encouraging when they took me and 3 others through the Vault of Glass the first time.  Just incredibly nice people.  Nor will I forget the random raid parties I hopped on in D2 and how silly and hilarious they were.  Team wipe?  Someone had already had a joke in the chamber.
there are people making death threats?
I'm sorry. DEATH THREATS?
    Some people are fucking weird bro.
        Death threats were barely reasonable when directed at blood and honey, but against the devs of Destiny??? Christ almighty
            Yeah- again, people are freaks. But with how many people play this game, and how its free to try, some of the worst end up playing it.

But for every piece of ahit, theres 20 people oppositely good
4 and a half hours last night telling those blueberries they would see Nezarac go down and I believed in them when I very much did not.
I'll never forget the time I got my friend (back) into d2. It happened to be during those 4 or 5 days where the apps were down cause they were messing with the API, so everyone had to go to the tower to open their vault.

We load into the tower, and some blueberry uses the fist bump emote on him. Then my friend went to a vault kiosk to see what exotic weapons he still had in there, and stops when he sees probably 7 people lined up in front of the vault, like it happens sometimes. He goes "They're in line?!?! This is nothing like the league community" (the game we had just been playing).
This made me tear up. Also I think the sherpas are 10 to 1 on the toxic people
Agreed, it's pretty clear he had a special place in his heart for Zavala. Through his mastery of the role and interaction with the community, he carved out a special place in our hearts too. I can't begin to speculate on what Bungie will do moving forward, but if they choose to have Zavala martyr himself to save all of us (which I hope they'll do), my eyes will not be dry. Even if they change voice actors, it'll choke me up. Standing in the tower with Zavala and hearing his voice makes it feel like Lance is still here in some way and when that goes away, it'll take away a character that has dominated my gaming hobby for a long time.
I heard he was a fan of the game as well as being in it. Likely was a project he was passionate and engaged with.
    It was pretty clear he was paying attention to the community and really cared about the game.  I think he did a few Destiny meme posts.  Not to mention he went on recording for the game through COVID lockdowns.
        I think when you read between the lines, he made some sacrifices to keep voicing Zavala. There's a reason nearly every major VA other than him has been replaced over the years.
            Which other VA got replaced?  I thought it was just Nathan Fillion being replaced by Nolan North for Cayde shortly before he died (and I suppose Peter Dinklage being replaced by Nolan North).
                Nolan North replaced Nathan Fillion as Cayde  
Nolan North replaced Peter Dinklage as Ghost  
Mara Junot replaced Gina Torres as Ikora  
Erika Ishii replaced Jamie Chung as Ana Bray  
Moira Quirk replaced Lauren Cohan as Elsie Bray

Also Bill Nighy and Peter Stormare are were just written out
                    Thank you.

I thought they sounded different, but for some reason I couldn't find anything on the VA change.
                I guess ikora got replaced but it's just some comment I read. They said Lance was the last original vanguard left.
        Lol he made a entire new voice line for the cabal cutscene cause people asked for it
    He played as a warlock pretty regularly. He would also, almost always, reveal on social media when he was recording for Bungie. It's say he loved this game and community. I don't know how Bungie is going to handle this with final shape already in the works. I don't think there is any way they can replace him like they did other actors.
    He even did a Cameo video as Zavala for someone
        He actually did several meme videos for free too
        He did one for Leopard, at least. Mocked him for his endless number of open tabs. He genuinely seemed like a good guy.
RIP Commander.
> Someone who he only lent his voice to.

I'm a fan of the voice acting industry, and Lance is one of those guys that can literally act out his character's story and personality in full just with his voice alone.
Dear god that post got me :(
    Me too, no lie.
        ![gif](giphy|l378giAZgxPw3eO52)
Yeah he was a busy guy. To still go out of his way to voice Zavala after so many years makes it clear it probably became a bit of a passion project for him
I was about to say. Went through like 50 posts (on Twitter) paying respects to him, and literally everything they mentioned were his role in "John Wick" and some mentioned his role in "The Wire." Completely ignoring the fact that he played Zavala for a lot longer than any other role he ever had.
The Destiny community is pretty great if you ignore the bad apples. 

Behind every level 1 guardian running around the cosmodrome, there’s two guys with 10,000 hours played in the game happily teaching him to spend all his free time fighting for the Traveler.
    i’m only 700 hours in but even i still love helping new guardians get their sea legs
    When I was really playing during COVID I think I did like 30 Sherpas and and pretty much most of my raids were teaching ones since some people would just tell first timers to just shoot add instead of actually teaching them and I probably was not even the highest Sherpa in my clan
Back in Destiny 1, I always kept a set of very low-level armor and weapons on me when the game got stale. I would go to the Cosmodrome and shadow new players until they understood I was there to help. And sometimes, I would enter strikes. It would place me with new blueberries. After entering, I would switch to raid gear and baby them through, never dominating so as not to take all their kills or fun. Often, I'd get a message saying, "I know what you're doing, and thanks!"
Destiny has been the best gaming community by far.
Now Im a truck driver and only get to go home every couple of months. I haven't done any raids, and I don't have any friends in the game anymore. But I was trying to get the Gjallarhorn and could not solo Grasp of Avarice. I found the Discord Destiny LFG server and begged for a hand. A great guy jumped in with me and another newb. We were awful, but he stuck with us all the way through. Great guy.
Can't say enough about D2 players. For every toxic player, I've met 10 nice ones.
    That’s awesome. It’s like the ninja turtles meme with the mentor guiding the baby turtles with the turtles guiding the mentor years later. o7
    I would put D2 on the top for community, even over the vaunted FF14 community. The random acts of kindness I've experienced here has been quite the number.
Meant to recreate a salute. The 'o' is a lil head and the '7' is a raised and bent arm
    Oh shit, I’m dumb
        Thanks for asking so the rest of us didn't have to o7
        No worries dude, I’ve been thinking it’s a fist bump for a looooong time.
        Nah, you're not dumb. At least, not for this reason. It's a perfectly fair question to ask.
            This whole time I thought it was a Bond reference, as in 007.... 

o7
    So an o/ or ol is ....
        it's yo/hi/howdy/whatev
It's mimicking a salute.
Why u askin me? Idk. Also this isn't askin so much so as just aknowledging that donations can be made and if people wanna to go there. Idek if for the family or the town
“MOMCares is an organization serving mothers and families, providing support, self care opportunities and healing experiences designed to strengthen the family unit with the matriarch at the center of its work. We are compassionate, trained advocates caring for moms and saving Black and brown lives. “

Asking for people to donate to charity in remembrance really doesn’t seem that odd
She was talking about donating to that charity that Mr Reddick supported. As in, in lieu of flowers...
....ooooooo-kay?
Currently brushin my teeth to go sleep so either wait 7/8 hrs or (which i highly reccomend) look up D2 concept art. Very cool in general and easy to find thanks to gaming news outlets compiling them in article. My banner is one for the early ideas of the farm. Gl gamer or see ya later
    Yo thanks for the reply and the great options and hope you have a good rest
I didn't do them before. I guess now I will.

"A Hollow man, leading others to die...for a silent god."

We did not follow a silent god, but the leader who through the uncertainty and pain, fought for everyone, every step of the way.

A silent God cannot give orders, a silent God cannot grieve with those who cry. A slient god cannot fight back and rally the people to never give up hope. Rest in peace Commander for we follow your orders until we are no more.

What a terrible day for rain.
    What a terrible day for rain indeed
        As a Vancouver resident.... it did not rain....

It's like the rain knew and just decided to shut up this week because there would be a different kind of downpour

![img](emote|t5_2we4j|5643)
    I mean, the Silent God did fight back and nearly killed itself in the process. We know now from extra raid lore that it released a gigantic blast of Light that practically ejected the Black Fleet from the galaxy, and buried Nezarec's pyramid a kilometer into the lunar soil from the sheer force (where Savathun then boarded the Pyramid and finished him off).

And then in its dying breath it released the Ghosts, to find people worthy of wielding the Light.

One of those Ghosts then found Lance Reddick, who died before his time many eons ago, and raised him as Zavala.
I'm the opposite. Used to buy them from orbit via the app but now I go out of my way to go in person just to hear a voice line and see the tributes. Every tower instance I've been in since the news this week has had a vigil of guardians paying respects. So cool.
I started a warlock a couple days ago and whenever I had to go to Zavala for bounties and quest progression and it was not easy. It's crazy how a person we never met has that kind of effect on us
Zavala and strikes were my favorite part from the second I stepped into this game.
If you've never seen Fringe, it's a pretty great series that he was in as well.
    I’m so happy I’ve seen Fringe mentioned almost everywhere. 

I always felt it was such an under appreciated and unknown show to many. 

That’s where I was first introduced to Lance, and then watched the wire.    May his memory live on through the greatness he was apart of.
        I love Fringe! I used to watch it on TV, then bought all the blu-rays and recently I have been watching it on HBO max. It’s a hidden gem for me but can be a hit or miss, one of my sisters love it, the other one thinks it’s meh. Lance was absolutely brilliant in it! >!He plays all his versions of Broyles with so good!<
    He’s also incredible in Bosch
    Fringe was what x files wasn't, amazing.
    I'm literally in the middle of watching "Corporate" and I'm not sure I can finish it. Hard to laugh at it now. :/ Just started watching a couple weeks ago and was so surprised and psyched when Sylens walked on screen as the CEO.
    French fried fringe Friday! Me and my buddy would get some burgers and fries and watch fringe every Friday. Love that show.
My wife was rewatching the Blacklist last night and Lance had a very brief part as one of the main character's colleagues. Made me realise just how much stuff he was in.
I first saw him in Lost, then the Wire. When I started playing Destiny I was so psyched. He was incredible in everything he was in, but his unique way of speaking  and top-notch acting worked so well for Zavala.

I've donated to the charity. I hope it's something he cared about. I know he cared about Baltimore, and supporting mothers in need is a good cause anyway. RIP Commander.
I only ever knew him as Zavala, it was always amazing hearing him in movies and making the connection.

He took a character that would otherwise be so bare-bones and made him into a father, leader, and guardian; destiny, and the entertainment business as a whole is a lot smaller now
Yesterday :(
Someone found his gamer tag and apparently he had been playing Titan for the last year. He was on Calus on legend the night before he passed.
    That just makes it worse!  😭😭😭
        Apparently he only did a raid in D1 too😭
    All I'm saying tho when guardian games roll around I ain't dunking shit since I play hunter. Titans deserve it this year
        I just play the game I'll end up literally anywhere, but definitely Dunkin with the titan this year
        make a titan and dunk it there, pretty sure you can do that
    He was playing on Legend difficulty? Man is the GOAT for real.
    you got a source for this? Would love to know this for sure
        [Front page on this sub.](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/11u89s5/lance_was_just_playing_last_nightdetails_in/)
            Cool
There’s no way it’s not coming. The charity is listed, the impact is undeniable. The community expects it. It’ll happen.
Each of the classes have a memory of Cayde class item
    Yeah, and that was only for the character being killed off. They should make "Memory of Zavala" class items for everyone, put it in Eververse, proceeds to charity.
        We do have the vanguard dere eververse armour that gives us Cayde-6's cloak for hunters. I don't know if the other classes have something similar
            They are for previous notable members of that class, Wei Ning and Ulan-Tan. The Hunter one is actually Andal Brask's set, Cayde took his cloak after his death, and if you compare them Cayde's is slightly modified.
                Mmm I see. Ye I know it's andal brask

        "Reddick's Lance" exotic glaive when Bungie?
    I could see them naming it based around his name like, Piercing Lance Cloak/Mark/Bond or something
        I saw an idea on the other subreddit (I think) for Reddick's Lance.
Bro I’m on hunter and I don’t care if it wouldn’t look good, give me a big ass shoulder thing.
    The 1 time I think everyone would agree that asymmetrical armour would be a good thing
Bungie has been good about such things, iirc they even have their own charity for things like when they did things like the dog sitting emote
God that was fucking terrible. It was a worldwide thing but only purchases from the US ( or even just select states) had a portion go to donations. I'd never heard anything about it being corrected so that's good at least.
    Yeah, iirc they made it so that 100% of what would be profit went to the guys family
Thank you for your service
It’s not for them. It’s a charity that he would have wanted donations to incase people want to show support. Get your head out of your ass for long enough to do a little research before you make a fool of yourself smh
    I'll admit that I had similar knee-jerk thought at first before realizing it was a charity.

Entertainment journalists can really be parasites. What an unnecessarily sensational headline. I won’t give them the click.

Stephanie Reddick, the wife of actor Lance Reddick, has posted a tribute on Instagram following the news of his death, thanking fans for their outpouring of love and support. Stephanie also announced that donations can be made to Mom Cares, which serves under-supported mothers in Baltimore with NICU experiences, including transportation, advocacy, and self-care opportunities. The 60-year-old actor starred in The Wire and the John Wick film franchise, and passed away from natural causes according to his representative.

Yes but for the past year, he's been playing only on Titan. And as our Commander, it only feels right (to me at least) to win it as a Titan
    He was a GUARDIAN
He was a GUARDIAN
Yea but voice actor is for zavalah a titan vanguard
Same :(
Both happened to him?!?! Fuck sake!
    The actual cause of death hasn’t been released but those are causes of death that could happen to literally anyone regardless of health condition
    No.  I’m saying these could happen.  It was likely one or the other.


Cause of death other than ‘natural causes’ hasn’t been released
Still. Why? How is her husband passing away the appropriate setting for her to ask for donations to a completely unrelated cause?
    This is really common, as fans often want to help in some way. 

This way that generous fan energy gets channeled into something the celebrity would’ve supported instead of towards the family that is likely financially fine despite the obvious pain of mourning and loss.
        Yeah, I've noticed that in the US. Everytime someone passes there's an ask for donations through gofundme or other cause. It's sickening.
            That's because funerals are extremely expensive for the average person. There's no obligation for anyone to donate. It's not "sickening" to ask for help when you need it, especially after a devastating loss.
                It’s sickening that the situation in a country is such that its citizens are forced to do that in order to afford dying. That’s something not even people in third world countries have to do.
Horse shit it’s a money grab like everything else
    Well…I hope she doesn’t see your ass is part of the Destiny community, but I suppose there always has to be at least one needle dick.
        What’s the destiny community?
            You are a 1 month old account
    > money grab

Damn greedy charities and shit
Way better actor than Shatner ever was tho
    Leagues above Shatner. Although I sometimes wonder if the acting was more a sign of the times rather than a reflection of the actor's talent. Shatner wasn't a great actor imo, but he did have some decent moments. I imagine modern actors use past performances for inspiration for how they themselves could perform better.

What I mean is that while Shatner wasn't a top class actor, I think of his career as a building block used by other actors to perfect their own performances, like incorporating a specific speech pattern.

Mind you, these are my own naive assumptions, I'm not an actor by any means lol

In all seriousness, I appreciate people like you teaching others. I did a lot of VOG teaching in year one and now that I'm washed up it makes me happy to see the "willing to teach" in the sea of "kwtd"
    Best/worst experience was once where i had to dual wield languages while teachin oryx. Big mess but big fun lol
    Ok, but can they teach me vow

How about Death Treaties?
Is that the dude with a bot set up to tell him when people are doing div runs and will join if someone leaves? Had that happen my div run, dude had 4K sherpas. Made the entire div puzzles so easy. Got to the final boss and 4 of us had never done it. Dude was just like “I don’t feel like explaining this. You two are team 1, you two are team 2, other dude that’s done this you’re with me on repairs. Just listen for my call outs, let’s go.” Got it first try. And all of this because he wants to get everyone div so no one ever runs the raid again because he despises it. Absolute legend
    > And all of this because he wants to get everyone div so no one ever runs the raid again because he despises it.

Damned spite is one hell of a motivator.
        It really god dam is…A mixture of extreme hate for the raid and seeing hundreds of ppl get stuck on GoS every day for hours. Like it just sucks….

I might just go back to make a video for GoS ppl really struggle on it but there are some tricks that make it fairly simple for anyone to do.
    "He despises it"! ! ! woah, now THAT is a man on a mission.
    Is there a way to get in contact with him? I need help to get it for my clan mates
        Cant even remember the guys name tbh, he just joined randomly after one of our guys quit halfway through, before we could find a new 6th. told us he has a bot set up to literally scan for people doing div runs and ping him if someone in said runs quits.
            Absolute madlad lol
    Yep div bot.

I really do despise that raid….I will put it into the ground.

No but if they fixed the loot table to make it more enticing and fixing bugs I would only…somewhat hate it…instead of my want to see GoS burn to the ground…(Mechanics are just to dull and interesting to me.)
He (Goose) actually got me Xenophage.
    Goose is to good for this community.
Get off the internet and you will realize 99% of people arent bad apples but the 1% vocal minority that people for some reason give attention to.
    Social media and its consequences
There's an entire discord out there full of sherpa getting people divinity. I only found out maybe a month and a half ago!

Edit: ~~https://discord.gg/756QngAV~~
    Whats the discord, i could help sherpa some people
        Doin' the Traveler's work.
    I would love to join that! What’s the name?
    Could you let me know the name? I still need to get mine one day
    Says the link doesnt work
        Hence the strike through
    I would also very much like to know the name of said discord
    Is there one for farming certain encounters of GoS?
        I couldn't say
    Discord link is borked can you update plz
        Can't unfortunately. The mods of the server contacted me and raged because they had no anti-bot or any sort of server security in place so they got swarmed by bots. I got banned and the link deactivated.
            Wow
                Well, they told me it was a public server so :/
                    So much for that
                    Do you have the name still at least?
                        [deleted]
There is a special place in my heart for guys like that. It resonates with my character. I only wish I was where I needed to be to even try being a sherpa for others.
    Well brother real talk when I started all of this (10 years ago) I never thought I would be able to help anyone. I was going through some really dark shit and had a lot of issues in my life.

But I loved playing destiny to get my mind off of things and fell in love with Gladd. The man became my idol of sorts and was able to make me laugh and mystified at how amazing of a personality and player he was.

I never thought I would low man a raid; but eventually did. I never thought I would do a low man flawless; but I eventually did. I never thought I would actually do a day 1; but I eventually did. 

Hell I never thought I would get over depression and be able to lead or talk to ppl. But in the game I have lead thousands of ppl and real life I lead meetings/other programmers pretty dam well with kindness and try to always keep everyone laughing and smiling while we work. (I am certainly not a perfect person and like anyone I have my good and bad days. Just important to know how to recover from the bad days.) 

Truthfully it was just about getting out of my comfort zone and trying new shit.

Honestly give it a shot you don’t know what you can do until you take that first step. (I know it sounds corny as f*** but it’s true.) 

I might make a video talking about all my Sherpa strategies and how I structure things.
        Thank you for the candid and cogent reply. I have backed off a bit from Destiny 2 to get some things in life in order; IRL. I also need to get a new computer in order to play D2 well. I used to be in a clan and play in fireteams and had friends and we would hang out in our Discord channel and it was so good. Been lonely since. Hoping to get to a point again where I can be an active player in teams instead of solo stuff. I have recently got my brother into it so that has been fun carrying him through the old campaigns from the Witch Queen and back.
            That’s fair. Real life shit > Destiny. 

I personally would suggest Toadsmoothie discord for meeting new ppl. A good amount of them are nice and chill ppl. You and your brother might find some nice ppl there. 

I joined awhile back when he solo prophecy for his gf so she could get that cute ghost cat thing.(Which I thought was adorable.) I wanted to get him div because I thought that was to dam cute.
                thanks. will check that out when I get back into it.
Aww Holly shit man thanks. Just was having a shit day stuck in bed coding (threw my back out at the gym the other day…my kettlebell swing form needs work…ow lol)

But I appreciate the love man.
I regularly go to Cosmodrome for my dailies that don't require specific places to clear. There's a certain kind of fun watching new lights learning the ropes and stepping in when it gets too overwhelming.
    I tend to head there with Lumina and BotA running Well and Healing Nades. When I have weapon requirements, I switch it up to The Stag.
I am so doing this. Brilliant .
Always go there for gunsmith bounties. Just hang about, get shot at because they don't understand how the seemless mp works, flex the drip, point to gold chests etc
I just learned duality a couple day's ago and it was fairly easy to pick up so doesn't have to be a prank
Check out dungeon.report (search for that in google) and you can pull up your individual clears from it... find the clear with the two you cleared it with and can see how many clears they as well have.
Most of the dungeon mechanics are pretty easy to get the hang of
Feel free to ask or pm and I'll do my best to help you out, since no one else seems to be stepping up to the plate. If your really interested me and a couple others have a discord (there's like 6 of us) I can get you in
    I'm in the same boat can you send me the discord link?
    Sorry for the late response, EU timezone here. Don't want to intrude in a private group as i'm not confident in my gameplay at all yet. Appreciate the offer!

My power seems to have come to a halt at 1770 and i can't figure out how to keep increasing it. Season pass asks that i do legend lost sector and some quests want me to do nightfall playlist but both content are crazy hard and i do not contribute. I'm also confused about gearing in general as i don't think the game ever explained how i  can identify which legendary weapon or armor i should keep and use or not.

My goal is raids at some point but i don't wanna get carried through it specifically, rather understand how i can get to there and how to gear for it correctly.
        Power level gets stuck at around 1770 is because you are not doing powerful content. Basically, content that rewards u powerful gear (golden symbol thingy, these are weeklies. You can google what is the power level cap and etc, and how to power level yourself.

In terms of raids, dungeons or others, you can join a sherpa group or the LFG discord to find people to sherpa you across content. This is when they teach you how to do the raids and dungeons, so that in the future you are able to do them by yourself without needing a sherpa (with 5 other players, of course.)
            Cool thank you, i'll try to get that powerful gear then and look for a group to help out. My confusion also comes with the various stats and elements related to mods and damage type. Gear is overflowing but i don't have the correct understanding of what to keep and use for which content and it's frustrating.
                It takes time to understand for sure, destiny has to be one of the most non-newplayer friendly games ever.

elements for guns determine, obviously, the element of what you are shooting. For low/early game content, it doesnt really matter since u will pierce the shield no matter what. But moving to high tier content, different elements break different shields. This can be seen from the color of the shields matching the color of the elements, purple shields being void, blue shields being arc and orange shields being solar. 

Having the wrong elements means you don't do as much damage as compared to breaking the shield with the **CORRECT** element. This specific modifier is called match-game iirc.

Elements dont matter unless you do specific builds i would say? or use the weapon damage boost mods on your legs. Some elements also serve to enhance builds, specifically in this season, its all void weapons. You would have noticed that in your seasonal artifact (thing below your ghost), there is a perk on the middle tree at the bottom, which grants volatile rounds (one of the most broken rounds/perks for any weapon rn.) to any void weapon. 

Kinda getting ahead of myself. TLDR; shields have different elements, look at color. if match game is active in end game content (90 if not 100% of the time it is active), shields can only really be penetrated by the same element, or else it takes too many shots to break. 

exception to match game is adaptive munition, where guns do increased damage to all shield types.
                    also mods are important for builds and ETC, there are a couple of good guides out there for mods in lightfall since they redid the mods during lightfall. If you want, you could DM me and i could send you a couple of videos explaining them, along with some builds
                        Thank you so much, that was very insightful! I'm on mobile rn but will definitely DM for videos later.
Hey you can shoot me a PM if you need any help with certain content or need tips.
r/destinysherpa
    Appreciated!!
Some people are fucking weird bro.
    Death threats were barely reasonable when directed at blood and honey, but against the devs of Destiny??? Christ almighty
        Yeah- again, people are freaks. But with how many people play this game, and how its free to try, some of the worst end up playing it.

But for every piece of ahit, theres 20 people oppositely good
It was pretty clear he was paying attention to the community and really cared about the game.  I think he did a few Destiny meme posts.  Not to mention he went on recording for the game through COVID lockdowns.
    I think when you read between the lines, he made some sacrifices to keep voicing Zavala. There's a reason nearly every major VA other than him has been replaced over the years.
        Which other VA got replaced?  I thought it was just Nathan Fillion being replaced by Nolan North for Cayde shortly before he died (and I suppose Peter Dinklage being replaced by Nolan North).
            Nolan North replaced Nathan Fillion as Cayde  
Nolan North replaced Peter Dinklage as Ghost  
Mara Junot replaced Gina Torres as Ikora  
Erika Ishii replaced Jamie Chung as Ana Bray  
Moira Quirk replaced Lauren Cohan as Elsie Bray

Also Bill Nighy and Peter Stormare are were just written out
                Thank you.

I thought they sounded different, but for some reason I couldn't find anything on the VA change.
            I guess ikora got replaced but it's just some comment I read. They said Lance was the last original vanguard left.
    Lol he made a entire new voice line for the cabal cutscene cause people asked for it
He played as a warlock pretty regularly. He would also, almost always, reveal on social media when he was recording for Bungie. It's say he loved this game and community. I don't know how Bungie is going to handle this with final shape already in the works. I don't think there is any way they can replace him like they did other actors.
He even did a Cameo video as Zavala for someone
    He actually did several meme videos for free too
    He did one for Leopard, at least. Mocked him for his endless number of open tabs. He genuinely seemed like a good guy.
RIP Commander.
Me too, no lie.

i’m only 700 hours in but even i still love helping new guardians get their sea legs
When I was really playing during COVID I think I did like 30 Sherpas and and pretty much most of my raids were teaching ones since some people would just tell first timers to just shoot add instead of actually teaching them and I probably was not even the highest Sherpa in my clan
That’s awesome. It’s like the ninja turtles meme with the mentor guiding the baby turtles with the turtles guiding the mentor years later. o7
I would put D2 on the top for community, even over the vaunted FF14 community. The random acts of kindness I've experienced here has been quite the number.
Oh shit, I’m dumb
    Thanks for asking so the rest of us didn't have to o7
    No worries dude, I’ve been thinking it’s a fist bump for a looooong time.
    Nah, you're not dumb. At least, not for this reason. It's a perfectly fair question to ask.
        This whole time I thought it was a Bond reference, as in 007....

So an o/ or ol is ....
    it's yo/hi/howdy/whatev
Yo thanks for the reply and the great options and hope you have a good rest
What a terrible day for rain indeed
    As a Vancouver resident.... it did not rain....

It's like the rain knew and just decided to shut up this week because there would be a different kind of downpour

I mean, the Silent God did fight back and nearly killed itself in the process. We know now from extra raid lore that it released a gigantic blast of Light that practically ejected the Black Fleet from the galaxy, and buried Nezarec's pyramid a kilometer into the lunar soil from the sheer force (where Savathun then boarded the Pyramid and finished him off).

And then in its dying breath it released the Ghosts, to find people worthy of wielding the Light.

One of those Ghosts then found Lance Reddick, who died before his time many eons ago, and raised him as Zavala.
I’m so happy I’ve seen Fringe mentioned almost everywhere. 

I always felt it was such an under appreciated and unknown show to many. 

That’s where I was first introduced to Lance, and then watched the wire.    May his memory live on through the greatness he was apart of.
    I love Fringe! I used to watch it on TV, then bought all the blu-rays and recently I have been watching it on HBO max. It’s a hidden gem for me but can be a hit or miss, one of my sisters love it, the other one thinks it’s meh. Lance was absolutely brilliant in it! >!He plays all his versions of Broyles with so good!<
He’s also incredible in Bosch
Fringe was what x files wasn't, amazing.
I'm literally in the middle of watching "Corporate" and I'm not sure I can finish it. Hard to laugh at it now. :/ Just started watching a couple weeks ago and was so surprised and psyched when Sylens walked on screen as the CEO.
French fried fringe Friday! Me and my buddy would get some burgers and fries and watch fringe every Friday. Love that show.
That just makes it worse!  😭😭😭
    Apparently he only did a raid in D1 too😭
All I'm saying tho when guardian games roll around I ain't dunking shit since I play hunter. Titans deserve it this year
    I just play the game I'll end up literally anywhere, but definitely Dunkin with the titan this year
    make a titan and dunk it there, pretty sure you can do that
He was playing on Legend difficulty? Man is the GOAT for real.
you got a source for this? Would love to know this for sure
    [Front page on this sub.](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/11u89s5/lance_was_just_playing_last_nightdetails_in/)
        Cool
Yeah, and that was only for the character being killed off. They should make "Memory of Zavala" class items for everyone, put it in Eververse, proceeds to charity.
    We do have the vanguard dere eververse armour that gives us Cayde-6's cloak for hunters. I don't know if the other classes have something similar
        They are for previous notable members of that class, Wei Ning and Ulan-Tan. The Hunter one is actually Andal Brask's set, Cayde took his cloak after his death, and if you compare them Cayde's is slightly modified.
            Mmm I see. Ye I know it's andal brask
    Proceeds to momcares.org
    "Reddick's Lance" exotic glaive when Bungie?
I could see them naming it based around his name like, Piercing Lance Cloak/Mark/Bond or something
    I saw an idea on the other subreddit (I think) for Reddick's Lance.
The 1 time I think everyone would agree that asymmetrical armour would be a good thing
Yeah, iirc they made it so that 100% of what would be profit went to the guys family
I'll admit that I had similar knee-jerk thought at first before realizing it was a charity.
#tl;dr

Stephanie Reddick, the wife of actor Lance Reddick, has posted a tribute on Instagram following the news of his death, thanking fans for their outpouring of love and support. Stephanie also announced that donations can be made to Mom Cares, which serves under-supported mothers in Baltimore with NICU experiences, including transportation, advocacy, and self-care opportunities. The 60-year-old actor starred in The Wire and the John Wick film franchise, and passed away from natural causes according to his representative.

*I am a smart robot and this summary was automatic. This tl;dr is 92.19% shorter than the post and link I'm replying to.*
He was a GUARDIAN
The actual cause of death hasn’t been released but those are causes of death that could happen to literally anyone regardless of health condition
No.  I’m saying these could happen.  It was likely one or the other.


Cause of death other than ‘natural causes’ hasn’t been released
This is really common, as fans often want to help in some way. 

This way that generous fan energy gets channeled into something the celebrity would’ve supported instead of towards the family that is likely financially fine despite the obvious pain of mourning and loss.
    Yeah, I've noticed that in the US. Everytime someone passes there's an ask for donations through gofundme or other cause. It's sickening.
        That's because funerals are extremely expensive for the average person. There's no obligation for anyone to donate. It's not "sickening" to ask for help when you need it, especially after a devastating loss.
            It’s sickening that the situation in a country is such that its citizens are forced to do that in order to afford dying. That’s something not even people in third world countries have to do.
Well…I hope she doesn’t see your ass is part of the Destiny community, but I suppose there always has to be at least one needle dick.
    What’s the destiny community?

Damn greedy charities and shit
Leagues above Shatner. Although I sometimes wonder if the acting was more a sign of the times rather than a reflection of the actor's talent. Shatner wasn't a great actor imo, but he did have some decent moments. I imagine modern actors use past performances for inspiration for how they themselves could perform better.

What I mean is that while Shatner wasn't a top class actor, I think of his career as a building block used by other actors to perfect their own performances, like incorporating a specific speech pattern.

Mind you, these are my own naive assumptions, I'm not an actor by any means lol

Lance was absolutely brilliant in it! >!He plays all his versions of Broyles with so good!<
Apparently he only did a raid in D1 too😭
I just play the game I'll end up literally anywhere, but definitely Dunkin with the titan this year
make a titan and dunk it there, pretty sure you can do that

    Cool
We do have the vanguard dere eververse armour that gives us Cayde-6's cloak for hunters. I don't know if the other classes have something similar
    They are for previous notable members of that class, Wei Ning and Ulan-Tan. The Hunter one is actually Andal Brask's set, Cayde took his cloak after his death, and if you compare them Cayde's is slightly modified.
        Mmm I see. Ye I know it's andal brask

"Reddick's Lance" exotic glaive when Bungie?
I saw an idea on the other subreddit (I think) for Reddick's Lance.
Yeah, I've noticed that in the US. Everytime someone passes there's an ask for donations through gofundme or other cause. It's sickening.
    That's because funerals are extremely expensive for the average person. There's no obligation for anyone to donate. It's not "sickening" to ask for help when you need it, especially after a devastating loss.
        It’s sickening that the situation in a country is such that its citizens are forced to do that in order to afford dying. That’s something not even people in third world countries have to do.
What’s the destiny community?

    Only the internet! Lol!!!
That’s a lot of coke for jijing bing
If h keep up with the jar jar speak then maybe...
It really god dam is…A mixture of extreme hate for the raid and seeing hundreds of ppl get stuck on GoS every day for hours. Like it just sucks….

I might just go back to make a video for GoS ppl really struggle on it but there are some tricks that make it fairly simple for anyone to do.
Cant even remember the guys name tbh, he just joined randomly after one of our guys quit halfway through, before we could find a new 6th. told us he has a bot set up to literally scan for people doing div runs and ping him if someone in said runs quits.
    Absolute madlad lol
Doin' the Traveler's work.
Hence the strike through
I couldn't say
Can't unfortunately. The mods of the server contacted me and raged because they had no anti-bot or any sort of server security in place so they got swarmed by bots. I got banned and the link deactivated.
    Wow
        Well, they told me it was a public server so :/
            So much for that
            Do you have the name still at least?

Thank you for the candid and cogent reply. I have backed off a bit from Destiny 2 to get some things in life in order; IRL. I also need to get a new computer in order to play D2 well. I used to be in a clan and play in fireteams and had friends and we would hang out in our Discord channel and it was so good. Been lonely since. Hoping to get to a point again where I can be an active player in teams instead of solo stuff. I have recently got my brother into it so that has been fun carrying him through the old campaigns from the Witch Queen and back.
    That’s fair. Real life shit > Destiny. 

I personally would suggest Toadsmoothie discord for meeting new ppl. A good amount of them are nice and chill ppl. You and your brother might find some nice ppl there. 

I joined awhile back when he solo prophecy for his gf so she could get that cute ghost cat thing.(Which I thought was adorable.) I wanted to get him div because I thought that was to dam cute.
        thanks. will check that out when I get back into it.
Power level gets stuck at around 1770 is because you are not doing powerful content. Basically, content that rewards u powerful gear (golden symbol thingy, these are weeklies. You can google what is the power level cap and etc, and how to power level yourself.

In terms of raids, dungeons or others, you can join a sherpa group or the LFG discord to find people to sherpa you across content. This is when they teach you how to do the raids and dungeons, so that in the future you are able to do them by yourself without needing a sherpa (with 5 other players, of course.)
    Cool thank you, i'll try to get that powerful gear then and look for a group to help out. My confusion also comes with the various stats and elements related to mods and damage type. Gear is overflowing but i don't have the correct understanding of what to keep and use for which content and it's frustrating.
        It takes time to understand for sure, destiny has to be one of the most non-newplayer friendly games ever.

elements for guns determine, obviously, the element of what you are shooting. For low/early game content, it doesnt really matter since u will pierce the shield no matter what. But moving to high tier content, different elements break different shields. This can be seen from the color of the shields matching the color of the elements, purple shields being void, blue shields being arc and orange shields being solar. 

Having the wrong elements means you don't do as much damage as compared to breaking the shield with the **CORRECT** element. This specific modifier is called match-game iirc.

Elements dont matter unless you do specific builds i would say? or use the weapon damage boost mods on your legs. Some elements also serve to enhance builds, specifically in this season, its all void weapons. You would have noticed that in your seasonal artifact (thing below your ghost), there is a perk on the middle tree at the bottom, which grants volatile rounds (one of the most broken rounds/perks for any weapon rn.) to any void weapon. 

Kinda getting ahead of myself. TLDR; shields have different elements, look at color. if match game is active in end game content (90 if not 100% of the time it is active), shields can only really be penetrated by the same element, or else it takes too many shots to break. 

exception to match game is adaptive munition, where guns do increased damage to all shield types.
            also mods are important for builds and ETC, there are a couple of good guides out there for mods in lightfall since they redid the mods during lightfall. If you want, you could DM me and i could send you a couple of videos explaining them, along with some builds
                Thank you so much, that was very insightful! I'm on mobile rn but will definitely DM for videos later.
Yeah- again, people are freaks. But with how many people play this game, and how its free to try, some of the worst end up playing it.

But for every piece of ahit, theres 20 people oppositely good
Which other VA got replaced?  I thought it was just Nathan Fillion being replaced by Nolan North for Cayde shortly before he died (and I suppose Peter Dinklage being replaced by Nolan North).
    Nolan North replaced Nathan Fillion as Cayde  
Nolan North replaced Peter Dinklage as Ghost  
Mara Junot replaced Gina Torres as Ikora  
Erika Ishii replaced Jamie Chung as Ana Bray  
Moira Quirk replaced Lauren Cohan as Elsie Bray

Also Bill Nighy and Peter Stormare are were just written out
        Thank you.

I thought they sounded different, but for some reason I couldn't find anything on the VA change.
    I guess ikora got replaced but it's just some comment I read. They said Lance was the last original vanguard left.
This whole time I thought it was a Bond reference, as in 007.... 

o7
