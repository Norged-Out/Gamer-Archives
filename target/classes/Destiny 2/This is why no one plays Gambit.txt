[[This is why no one plays Gambit]]





Those poor guys were trying to get the old triumph (& possibly an emblem)
    Which triumph? 

... and is the emblem cool?
        Where everyone dunks 15 motes at the same time.
        [Here is the Emblem: Dance The Demons Away](https://destinyemblemcollector.com/emblem?id=180108391)

It‚Äôs cool - in that almost no one seems to have it.  To nail it you had to wait until the other team invaded twice (so they couldn‚Äôt invade again and wipe your motes) but also collect the 60 motes quick enough to bank before the other team‚Äôs primeval was killed and ended the match.
            Loads of people have it. There was regular lfgs to farm for it. I've done it at least 10 times with people for a laugh.
            Me and my clan got that by accident the first week Gambit was introduced. It‚Äôs the only reason I have it lol
                Yeah, back then we made sure everyone in the clan got it ‚Äî and would even message opposing teams for a pact to allow each side to knock it out before invading. 

But that was a long time ago and the majority of Destiny‚Äôs current active player base weren‚Äôt there for the release of the new game mode called ‚ÄúGambit‚Äù ‚Ä¶which is what I mean when I say not a ton of people have it.
        Don't tempt yourself, ignorance is bliss my friend.
        [deleted]
            Dont mind me I'm just stopping by
    This is why you don't converge to bank until *after* you deal with an invade (or the very least wait until the bank is no longer blocked)
    Sadly the triumph and emblem have been retired.
Holy shit 4x 15 motes lost

I would've split my keyboard AND table in two
    Split the whole damn household
        lmfaoooo ain't gonna recover from that one
        Split the entire planet
            Split an atom
    Shoulda gone for it during labs where there couldn‚Äôt be an invader till they deposited.
The problem is. The heavy slot has always been an issue in gambit. And it will never stop. These are the ones I can remember  

Sleeper
Q Breaker
Truth
Xeno
Eyes
Gjally

And these are just the exotics. There has been some random ones here and there. Lately it was Eriana for a few lol. But yeah heavy slots have been an eyesore

Ps I remember two legendary MG. Hammerhead and Delirium as well
    Hammerhead was the best scout rifle in the game for gambit
        I will never get rid of my hammerhead. Never
        Good times ü•≤
        hahaha!!! That took me a second
        No that would be God Roll Patron of Lost Causes or Randy's Throwing Knife at least imo

(And yes I get the joke)
            Well Hammerhead was first meta when gambit prime first came out so those two weren't going to be in the game yet for a good 6 months
    ah yes Xenophage gambit...good times
        At least you had to aim...
            ...in the general direction of a target. The bullets on that thing feel like they're the size of Guardians.
                They are‚Ä¶
                It fires handheld hitscan mortars
        Those good times will be had again, when the RPM nerf gets reverted soon
    Also Leviathan's breath and Thunderlord were a thing albeit less intense
        I was about to mention thunder lord. It was my go to before getting 1k back in Prime.
        I use leviathan a lot, and it's not even near the level of Gally and some others heavy.
            At least you have to aim with leviathans breath...
    i remember Sleeper oh god
    Then why couldn‚Äôt they just disable heavy weapons while invading? I imagine that‚Äôs not a hard feature to implement.
        Maybe a gambit labs? That‚Äôd be kinda nice.
        Disabling heavy temporarily for both the invader and the defending team could be interesting.
            Now I'm imagining someone invading while the Primeval is up to block DPS from heavies on it
                that's actually a neat idea, have invaders that try to survive as long as possible to delay dps, basically be the blocker

combine it with a massive decrease in kill healing and it sounds fun
                    Cloudstrike would like to know their location
            sniper rifle moment
            No please don‚Äôt. Why are you all complaining about things that are part of the game ‚Äî why don‚Äôt Bungie just disable Destiny?!?!
                Disabling the game itself temporarily for both the invader and the defending team could be interesting.
                    Haha not what I meant but that made me laugh üòÇ
            My fav take so far is that it should be disabled for PVP, but still damage in PVE. It'd prioritize the Invader and add a level of fear when you die (since you might lose your heavy), and it'd balance some of the most shit balancing issues.
        I‚Äôve personally never had issues with rockets before. Maybe because I‚Äôm usually the attacker? But even still I use my rockets for the prime evil . And I use sniper , 100%
        I would love a bunch of different modes of Gambit.  u/steddfaststedd mentioned a scorch rocket gambit. That'd be cool.  Also:  
\- Maybe a version where your heavy limitation was determined by the enemy (It's Hive! Only swords are allowed)\*

\- A version where no heavy weapons are allowed, or don't get turned on until the other team has the Primeval

\- an infinite ammo mode

\- A mode where you can carry up to 30 motes but after you get ten, you take double damage from all sources. If you bank all 30 motes it either sends two large blockers or a humongous blocker.

&#x200B;

Just some thoughts
            Summons Crota.... if all 4 bank 30 it forces the other team into the Crota Raid....
                So long as we got the banger music I would be slightly less mad. : p
    Remember Queenbreaker??
    I haven't played for a while but i remember using Black Talon and wiping other team without problem. Heavy exotics were always OP in gambit
    21% Delirium was such a great weapon imo. I still have it in my vault.
        It's still viable in 1350 content, including most of our current raids, and all four currently available dungeons. With next season's MG buffs, you might consider pulling it out, Killing Tally's a +65% damage boost at full power.
            Damn, I didn't even think about that! I'll definitely consider it for 1350 content. A 65% dmg bonus would be niceee
                Do bear in mind that weapons are hard coded to have better damage with a higher power level, even if light advantages are not a thing. It was made like that so the forbidden duo couldn't be as powerful even in content where you could get away with equipping them.
                    While you're not wrong, that power advantage caps out at +20 power, so in 1350 content there is no difference between 1370 and 1550. Based on what I'm able to find, that power advantage caps out at [roughly 13%](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sObekOYHkPDKCqAGbZcUfX9LRF0cRU4yn7m0KURY2UY/edit#gid=1575509473). Not nothing, but things like Delirium's 65% boost would still be a net gain.

Also, this whole system predates sunsetting. It is not a product of it, simply the mechanic through which it works.
                        Ah. Thank you. : )
    Oh man. I remember Hammerhead when it was introduced to the game. Everyone used it to invade with.
        I still use it.
    I want to see scorch rocket gambit
        Oh wow I never considered game modes for gambit, that sounds really fun actually
        I didn't know I needed that until now.
    Ahhh, yes. It begun with Sir Reginald Wardcliff... But not long came The King Sleeper, countered by the Queen's Breaker, rested control from by the Truth tracker, Simply to be outdone by the Bringer of Death, but once there is death, comes a genophage of Xeno scum, only for the god of sight to completely dominate the field... Only for it's father to return upon bungie breaking it's knees.
    Disable heavy and supers as soon as you go through the portal to invade. There, I just fixed Gambit.
        Too logical  for them üòÇüòÇüòÇ
        Disable supers for the enemy team while you're at it. I.e no supers at all for anyone anytime period
        No, keep supers but have certain times when they're disabled. If they want to spend supers on invaders when in Primeval phase, let them. You can't get them back like you can rockets and it'll allow last ditch efforts to clutch.
    I honestly wonder how people would feel if the Heavy slot got locked during Gambit.
    Heavy gets disabled on invade. That would help instead of nerfing each weapon.
    Delirium and Hammerhead were honestly fine. I hate the instant crossmap death more
        That‚Äôs what I mentioned them for. They were heavy scout/snipers lol
    As a old sleeper gambit vet yea the one with heavys can kill and destory the team quickly.
    At least some of those required more skill. Eyes and gjally are the two that shouldn‚Äôt be in there.
        ah yes skillful xeno with bullets with a hitbox the size of atheon
            Omar can‚Äôt track like the other two.
        None of those required ‚Äúskill‚Äù they all hit the target no matter how far you were and one shot them. That‚Äôs what made them broken and eventually got them nerfed.
            I firmly believe in an exotic rotation in gambit.
    Been confused about that since I only started playing the updated Gambit recently. The new crates make it even easier to get heavy ammo, not sure how that was supposed to help.
        It‚Äôs not the heavy crates. It‚Äôs the heavy‚Äôs one general. When one gets nerfed or a new one becomes the meta (xeno eyes and heir) will return to dominate in season 17. That‚Äôs the issue. I‚Äôm the past we also had taken and fallen armaments that gave heavy. Sadly it will never NOT be heavy weapon invade influenced
            Fair, I just meant making it easier to get the ammo exacerbates the situation. Before you had that one crate that only one person could get ammo from, now it seems to load every time you clean out an area, and the whole team can get ammo
    It‚Äôs not an issue. We need to stop saying it is ‚Äî the exotics offer a perk that we should be able to take advantage of. I haven‚Äôt been able to pull off what‚Äôs shown in this video carrying a Gjallahorn into Gambit that easily.
    They would have died to a single cloudstike shot. Bottom line dont stack when the invader shows up.
    The issue is in every game mode is heavy way to much. Yes that‚Äôs sounds winy but be honest how many times have you been killed in the crucible by G-horn? I get it I could use it too but I don‚Äôt like it to use this gun in PvP for trials heavy should be disabled all along‚Ä¶ especially when you are not on the same light level like your opponents>.< I definitely know most people will disagree
        Can‚Äôt compare crucible though. Different modes and correct me if I‚Äôm wrong. If you die in gambit you don‚Äôt lose heavy. But even if they take heavy back out. You will still get drops regardless. Not everyone but enough to melt your prime
            I wonder if it would be possible to lock heavy during the invade phase so you can‚Äôt use it against players :D
                I don‚Äôt think it would be well received. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs still in all crucible modes. Even in mayhem a super based mode lol
    I miss Delirium. I hope the Ritual Weapon 2 seasons from now is an MG with a tweaked Killing Tally. Such a good perk (I assume next season is a Trace Rifle due to the inbound Trace Rifle buffs and I assume Killing Tally would be tweaked due to power creep it could cause compared to other damage perks if it wasn't)
That angle is just super lucky. Catch me having to run 10 seconds to see a single person alone xD
    And then you finally get to someone and they bean you with the craziest sniper flick headshot of all time
        I‚Äôve been hit by some pretty bullshit, mind reading type of sniper headshots when I invade. Like, I‚Äôm pretty sure they were using a wall hack or something because of how quickly and accurately they are able to dome an invader at all times.
            I can say with a certainty that if you spend way too much on Gambit (like I did since Shadowkeep), it is very easy to predict where the invader is spawning based on the combatant spawn zones and the position of the rest of your team.

So its not more of a wall hack rather than the game spawning you in a very predictable place and any seasoned player would correctly identify where you jumped in more times than not and send you back real soon.
                Up until it spawns the invader with the enemies
                I just wish the game would say where the invader is in bound from. I'm not going to take the time to memorize invader spawn points for a mode I view as a chore.
                That has nothing to do with someone constantly doming the invader no matter where they are. Even after the invader has moved around, they will get immediately domed over and over.
                    that's called skill gap.

Honestly, its not hard to find an invader, they are only hard to counter when they catch you off-guard with their heavy.
                         No, it‚Äôs most likely called wall hacks.
                            sure mate.
                                I can‚Äôt count the number of times I‚Äôve been 360 no scoped no matter where I am on the map. But sure, chalk every single one up to ‚Äúskill.‚Äù Lol
                                    "360 no-scoped"

maybe you are letting them hit 360 no scopes with your piss awful invading.

I don't chalk it up to skill issue every time, but the fact that you say you can't count the number of times is just saying that you die a lot and blame it on wall hacks.
            There are some videos on invader spawn kills. Less mind read and more mechanic exploitation and invader not being ready for it
                No, I mean, they legit like 360 no scope me no matter where I‚Äôm standing. Even if I‚Äôve already moved from the spawn point.
            The Herod-C Auto Rifle has an invader tracker trait that marks the opposing invader for you and your team if you land a hit on them. It's pretty much legal wall hacks. If you have a general idea on how the spawn mechanics work then you'll more than likely be able to mark invaders instantly and your team will be prepared to shoot instead of blindly hopping around trying to locate the invader.
                Oh I know. I use that gun a lot in freelance to help my team spot the invader (because blueberries). But a lot of the situations I‚Äôm personally referring to, I took no damage from anything beforehand and purposely went out of the way to pop my head around places where you normally wouldn‚Äôt expect an invader and would still get instantly domed.
                    ahhh okay, then definitely wall hacks XD
    Exactly.
And if they saw you first be ready to get bonked with rockets and snipers
        It‚Äôs definitely the worst when the moment they hear invader they go to all the different spawn points waiting with their Gjhorn, Sleeper etc. waiting for you or even prefiring as the weapon will do the rest.
    Yep. When I invade, the portal almost always puts me in the worst place imaginable for an invader. I usually have to hoof it a good 10 seconds or so before I even get a shot at someone.
I think it‚Äôs kinda clear what was happening here. A group together trying to do the triumph to dunk 15 all at the same time. 4x15 just doesn‚Äôt happen otherwise.
    I found it a bit more frequent last labs. Plenty of team's coordinating 60 banked from ~20 to try to skip enemy portals.

But still- OP had *all* the stars aligned here lol
I think that gjallarhorn is the only reason why I dislike gambit sometimes
    Also Truth and EoT.

They're the source of pretty much all my gambit frustration. 



Oh, and that guy who banks 7 motes after the first wave of enemies.
        Or worse, the guy who banks 4 motes.
            I‚Äôd rather someone bank 4 motes than someone clean up the rest of the enemy wave when they can already bank those motes (it‚Äôs Primeaval time)
                Oh well yeah, in that case of course :) I just meant banking 4 motes after the first wave, like in the beginning of the game :)
        I had a match where one dude invade with Thruth like 3 times and he always had a rocket ready for each of my teammates. I hated that match
#Invaders should have heavy locked, you aren't going for DPS.

That way no, weapons are destroyed.
    Nah if invaders dont get heavy they just get perma shit on by 4 people with heavy lmao, just disable heavy as a whole in gambit
        I could get behind that.
            Its not like we need heavy anyway, we got great dps options in special and kinetic, all heavy does is speed up the boss phase and ruin the pvp aspect of gambit
        Disable heavy for everyone on the side where an invasion is in progress, that way people can still use em for PvE stuff freely.
            That could be fun.

Tryna DPS the boss? Lemme invade so you can't use your stupid exotic rocket launchers.
                Oooohhhh interesting. As a gambit lover I could hella get behind this.
        The problem is the boss. It would take forever to beat the boss without heavy.
            You could just lower the health of the boss
                You could also just disable invading. But both seem key to the game mode for some odd reason.
                    Why would you want to disable invading?
                        Why would you want to lower the health of the boss?
                            So that heavy can be gone? Without it being an issue?
                                Seems like heavy is only an issue because of invaders. 

Listen I'm going to speed up this conversation. 

Your likely response, if you are like anyone else I've had this conversation with, is along the lines of "But invading is a core game mechanic for Gambit. It's the only mode that combines PvE and PvP!"

Yup, I don't disagree.

But so is the boss fight. 

I don't think nerfing the boss fight is any more valid than removing the concept of invaders entirely. Heavy is important to the boss fight, but damaging for overall Gambit health during invasions. That's the core balance problem of the entire game mode. Hypothetically if invasions were not a thing, using heavy ammo strategically would still be hugely important. 

I don't think it's a valid tweak to the game to remove heavy ammo entirely.
    Block both team heavy during an invade but boost the invader (more resistance and more damage)

It would also make invades more impactful during the boss phase
This right here is why I think Gambit is flawed on a fundamental level
One rage quit lol
    Would you Blame them? üòî
        I assume you‚Äôre being sarcastic. But yes, I would blame them. Never back out, always comeback and win. Always try.

Edit: id never leave my team. 100 to 0 i would never give up on my team like that.
            I mean I wasnt really sarcastic. In my experience with Gambit since Forsaken is: "You loose too much at the start? Theres no coming back" 

How new Gambit plays out in my experience: "You loose too much at the start? Theres no coming back. You did pretty good and got x6 on the primeval while the enemy is just spawning theirs? You will still loose" 

I dont leave the match when we are mid-way to near the end... But if it happens at the start... Theres no recovery, at least in the games Ive done theres none a recovery, just a drawn out and painful defeat.
                The game is almost over anyway, just camp the portal and piss them off for the rest of the game.
                I‚Äôve come back from being way down with a teammate who would invade and get a couple of kills each time. It was a great feeling of accomplishment winning that.
Im sorry you guys rob yourselves of that experience by quitting.
                    sadly for me the grind is more of a chore than reward. Lately ive been feeling forced to grind, say for example gambit just to get the shotgun skin and the seasonal challenge. Id be playing for the grind and not having fun, its a vicious cycle I dont like :(
                        This is me in crucible. I had 2 matches where I didn‚Äôt score a single point in freelance IB. It was a terrible experience. I still gave it my all and didn‚Äôt give up because my teammates at least deserve that from me. For the record I think only one or 2 teammates had a point those matches..
Correction: why no crucible player plays gambit
    Or PvE player.
I've been peddling this idea to all my friends. Upon entering the portal, invaders should be stripped of their weapons and given a unique invader-only weapon that is powerful but not an "I win" button. That is, if they continue to let invaders have fat over shields and wallhacks.
    That would work if the entire enemy team wouldn‚Äôt just barrage the invader with Gjally. Problem still comes back to heavy weapons.
        Just give everyone 1 half load of their heavy weapon. Once it's gone, it's gone forever so use your shots wisely. 

Would add some actual thought behind heavy usage instead of "see enemy, send ghorn rocket their way"
            Maybe. But that Only draws primeval fights longer since heavy is 99% how you deal Damage to the Boss. Specially with this new gambo system
        True
        Someone had a really good idea about it. Once someone invades, that place gets their heavy blocked for the remain time of invading.

So when you invade, you or the enemy team cant use heavy at all until invader dies/leaves.
        I think the problem comes back to Destiny‚Äôs TTK in anything PvP related
        They could theoretically just do that now, but most randies I get matched with won‚Äôt even engage the Invader.
    Taken Blight relic. I‚Äôve always said the invader should just become ‚Äútaken‚Äù and have the blight relic. It can still shoot and use the grenade for an AoE burst, but i think that could be interesting.
        If they allow the invader to get close enough to do the grenade burst then they deserve to get one shot.
            That‚Äôs my exact point! ;D
Yeah they tried to fix invasions but just made them worse with the heavy ammo crates at the end of a phase.
    I thought Invasion swap did a good job with this honestly. You could predict to a certain extent when the enemy would enter the portal and be somewhat ready for it while also limiting the ability for a good invade to utterly decimate a team from ever coming back.

Invasion Swap labs honestly was the best feeling Gambit to date.
    I usually try to gild Dredgen. Not this season. Cant stay alive one full game with so much 'gorn
        Heck, I'm just trying to get dredgen finished this season. only thing I need is Thrillmonger and every time we get invaded I just know I'm gonna die.
            An idea could be to just kill stuff quickly and use mobility. Or use things to be protected like the titan flan glaive (pocket WoD). Basically your priority would be to survive and kill, not so much grab motes.
            If you have it, try doing the Witherhoard/IKELOS SMG combo with warmind cells. Warmind cells don't have the reach they used to have but they can still kill shit quickly. That and BTDB. Helped me get Thrillmonger quickly.
                Unfortunately I don't have Shadowkeep (or 30th Aniv/WQ) which I probably should. I am aware that Witherhoard would let me easily get Thrillmonger. Currently using Agers+Ikelos SMG. Forgot about Warmind cells though, was wondering why everyone was saying an average SMG was good, your comment made me realise why.
                    Ager's works too.
I am so glad next week is double infamy points so I can grind out the ornament and be done with this mode for the season
I might hate Gambit more than I hate Crucible
    Then people will spam things like erianas and jotunn, remove one thing and another will be found
        Pretty sure nobody is going to be particularly afraid of Jotunn spam.
            I mean I guess, but there are other weapons that will dominate the enemy team
                Darci meta when?
                    Lmao, seriously tho I hope bungie does something with darci, it has a nice theme and a very cool look,and I simple rework of the weapon would do it wonders
                        I think it just got power crept to obscurity. I think a modest buff in damage with a touch of precision damage bonus could do wonders for it, maybe add triple tap too. Right now I don't think it performs better than a kinetic legendary, while taking up a heavy exotic slot.
                            Actually, with the new airborn accuracy trait bungie will be adding, I feel like there‚Äôs potential here, perhaps darci could have the best in air accuracy in the game, whilst having some other things, like the triple tap you mentioned and maybe the ability to keep your tracker while aiming down the sight
                                Quite frankly they could simply move it to the kinetic slot and it'd probably be fantastic, especially getting that 10% damage bonus there and being a special weapon
                                    Ya, but idk it feels like it would brake something idk
I love gjally to death, but they really need to ban it from gambit. Its not doing that mode any favors at all.
    From someone who's been killed by gjally more than a few times in gambit, it's more of a tactical problem.  Don't group up. Otherwise easy pickings.
        the main problem with gjally is the tracking, it tracks way too hard, its not because people are constantly grouped up
            If only there were things between you and the opponent that could break the tracking...

Damn those wide open maps with zero cover
                Yeah I totally haven't been killed behind cover, multiple times, via a direct hit, because of the tracking.
                    Let me just hide behind this small rock and hope the 7 tracking rockets don't find me... using things like buildings or cover to break tracking just wouldn't be sporting.



Do you have any game sense at all?
                        Yeah, a small rock is what I was hiding behind. 

Have you watched ghorn gameplay at all?
                            Yeah and it's always people who think every encounter in this game has to be open gun fight with no strategy, just run at the enemy and hope for the best...

Like the crucible.

Exotics aren't gambits biggest problem. It's the morons who fill the playlist trying to bot thier way to a cheap pinnacle.
                                I mean. Even if the Rocket hits your cover instead of you. Wolfpack Rounds go over the cover and hit you anyways. 

Move away? The invader is still in the field, and if that first Rocket didnt kill you the second one on the chamber likely Will.
                                    Which would be a problem if the maps were open, which they're not. 

People just don't learn the maps because they don't care about the gamemode, they just want to idgaf thier way to a pinnacle. The amount of these videos complaining about heavy in gambit and its a dude standing in the open or hiding behind the bank. 

There is only 4 maps. Each with 3 fronts and a central bank. Each front has a sightline to the bank but not to the other fronts. An invader can only spawn in a front without enemies. Both teams are guaranteed heavy. He knows where you are but its a 4v1 and even if your team doesn't know where he spawned and splits up it would still be a 2v1 with both sides having heavy. Its not rocket science.
        I see you did not do the assignment which was watching the video.
            I did, and if you give an example when others are farther away from each other and it tracks better than it should, you will have a better example to show everyone. Otherwise, much to everyone who down voted me, it is still mostly a grouping problem with that clip.
                >it is still mostly a grouping problem with that clip

`Be me`

`Playing Gambit with a couple of the homies`

`See that there is a triumph when we bank 60 at once`

`By god we get 15 each and book it to the bank to get them in before an invade`

`Some scrub with gjally comes in and within 3 seconds of invading mercs all 4 of us before we can bank with 1 rocket`

`"It's mostly a grouping problem." "You shouldn't all group up, especially when you have that many motes." "I can't believe that you'd commit such a grievous oversight." "Your team sucks because you couldn't adjust your tactics when someone invaded." "You really should get gud."`

Personally, I'm not *that* invested, but Gjallarhorn presents a braindead-easy way to kill all of the opposing team. As someone who "who's been killed by gjally more than a few times in gambit," you probably are aware there really isn't a whole lot you can do, unless you out play the invader so bad it's embarrassing. In this video specifically, without Gjally or EoT, that team would have banked 99/100 times with the invade coming in when it did.  (Source: I reset my Gambit rank 3x during Arrivals and have done it 5x since.)

Gjally has an issue that I think should be addressed, do I have the answer? Not really, because I'm not a game dev and don't really know how that shit works.
    It‚Äôs a problem in crucible as well. It‚Äôs better than wardcliff somehow
I really think they should rework gambit into like horde mode and turn motes into currency to buy special/heavy ammo
Honestly I have been enjoying gambit a lot more than in beyond light. While there is a lot of heavy spam, things feel more even which makes things more unpredicatable and close. Like I don't actively hate myself for playing gambit which I did prior.
    I really liked gambit prime back in the day. I was a gambit addict. Invading was my specialty. My buddy was a collector. I miss that mode. 

Gambit is... It feels more casual now for lack of better words. Yes there are heavy spams and whole teams of g horn at times it's not a shit show... Usually. Sleeper used to wreak havock along with truth. I won't miss those days.
Gambit grind next reset for the ornament and that‚Äôs all I need it for.
Yes yes indeed this is why I stopped playing Gambit üòÆ‚Äçüí®
I mean that was like the perfect spot to spawn for the invade, wide open shot on exactly where they happened to be standing.
I remember seeing some bounties that are basically like ‚Äúcomplete 1 match‚Äù or ‚Äúbank 5, 10, and 15‚Äù 

it must be rough if you need a bounty that just basically says ‚Äúplay gambit, please‚Äù lol
This is indeed why, after playing it daily ever since it released, I have stopped playing gambit. The terror of xenophage and eyes of tomorrow was Just 'annoying meta' but gjallerhorn had singlehandedly destroyed this game mode for me...
This is why invasions should have been us taking over a blocker.. pvp should have never needed to be in this mode
No offence, but ppl like you is the reason I don't play gambit anymore. Like, why am I here actually aiming to kill each one of the enemy players when I'm about to die from some tracking RL coming from miles away? Good on you for that Army of One, but it sucks mate.
    no motes to bank?
No one? Video you post beg to differ
Average Gjallarhorn enjoyer
gambit equivalent of getting a seventh column
I like gambit a lot actually.

You should try it with friends.
Lol that‚Äôs the best gambit clip anyone has ever taken
The issue is they should deposited those motes rather than play for the 15
Heavy should just be disabled. I love Gambit, but I think everyone would feel better about invasions if the invader had to use primary/special as they are already at an advantage with tracking and OS. Maybe give them 45 seconds so they can sneak around and pick people off by going through teleporters.
But people were complaining about erianas lmao
There has been so many times where the person fires gjally at me and completely misses them 10 seconds later I‚Äôm killed by a sentient seeker
Either get rid of heavy for the invader, or get rid of wall hacks for the invader. No other thing is wrong with Gambit other than the winning team can still invade. But invading is the underlying issue with Gambit as a whole. 

You ban people who have infinite heavy, you ban people with wallhacks, but let's give those options to the fucking invader who can decide who dies with a well placed rocket? What?
Gambit is trash, haven‚Äôt played once in two seasons and it feels amazing to ignore that pinnacle activity. I play enough to not need to go through a terrible experience for the sake of a pinnacle.
The invader in me would be very happy to get this. The reaper in me would sob uncontrollably
I feel the main reason people dont play it is just the constant Gally spam, tbh it used to be more enjoyable when heavy ammo was a commodity and not something everyone gets every time you complete a wave and/or kill the HVT
Ban power weapons?
Gambit will be the shittiest game mode until they:

A.) Bring back reg gambit and allow you to choose that mode or prime. 

2.) Get rid of invading altogether or at the very least only allow invasions during prime take down or limited. 

And D.) Fix the fucking motes falling through the ground, impossible to pick up. 

P.S. I'd also like to see light enabled Gambit.
    - Get rid of invading

*What*???
        Yes..  Make it a boss burn race. Some people hate/despise pvp and others who love pvp despise Gambit. This is why it's a shit game mode. Not to mention for the time invested it's virtually pointless outside of nerd points.
        Yes. It is the single most annoying mechanic in the game mode.
            ????

I love the mechanic itself. Killing the Invader makes me feel actually awesome, because I was able to use my kit to take them down even though they had the advantage. As well, I \*love\* invading, and I always heap praise on my teammates when they get them. When I'm invading, it makes me feel amazing to manage a team-wipe. 

What I hate is heavy weapons. Because it makes invasions pointless to fight against, or makes it pointless to invade if you aren't using the meta (Xeno, for instance). Like I typically get 12-16 kills in Gambit and I've been killed by Chain of Command and Xeno that I've focused on unlocking both just so I can use them
Heavy should be removed from gambit
    Then how would you do fast strong dps?
        Using khostkov of course
        Special ammo and abilities
if you want to play Gambit, you have to adapt

an invader comes and you're near the bank? bank in 0.2 seconds or run away, no middle options, no fighting if you can, let your team mates hunt him but don't lose motes for nothing.
No Army of One? ü•≤
Invader incoming and 4 people sitting on the bank. It‚Äôs a player problem not the game
    He got the shot off almost immediately after the invasion notification. The vast majority of players would not have reacted that fast regardless. Stop blaming shitty game design on the players.
        If only there were two giant bars at the top of the screen that showed exactly the amount of motes both were holding and have deposited??????????

Stop making excuses for small brain players who ignore basic game mechanics
            That literally does nothing for the fact that he basically got an immediate, free shot a second after invading. Just because you can see that the event team *can* invade, doesn‚Äôt mean they will.
Glorious
I hate you, but take my upvote anyways because the title is correct.
Buddy youre the one using gjally
[deleted]
    There's a triumph for a 4√ó15 bank, they were probably going for that
    Yeah and they all bunched up at the bank trying to clear the blockers. Man, blueberries...
Someone needs to tell these people about spacings
This is why you don't bunch up, kids.
Gambit is awesome
Literally one of the many reasons why it's called Gambit. 

Do you go after the VIP or focus on guaranteed motes with team?

Do you invade and leave them short one player?

Do you bank your 7 or hold on for 10?

Bank together and risk losing them or settle to single blocker now?

Do you hunt the invader or hide?

Do you hunt invader or focus on Primeval DPS?

Do you save or use invasion portals ASAP throughout match?

Get those last couple motes now or kill blockers early?

None are equal in ratio of risk vs reward, but they're all a gamble and strategy.

I think the new Gambit needs some tweaking (like invasion frequency at bosses, and how much you heal upon death), but I love how the newest one encourages roles. You need a dedicated sentry to clear blockers. You need a strong invader. When invasions happen to you, it's important to have 1-2 counter invaders ready to immediately peel off their activity and come hunt the invader down.
    Despite the fact that I hate Gambit and always have, this is actually a decent take. 

The game mode itself is a good concept with some decent bare bones, but it exists in a sandbox that rewards you so much for doing so little. Gambit itself is not the problem, but rather the sandbox that it's being played in. But the sandbox can't be balanced around Gambit because then that screws up the rest of the game...

&#x200B;

Gambit needs a separate sandbox, built from scratch if it's ever going to work. Too bad that'll never happen...
But sure, the player‚Äòs mentality is the problem, not heavy‚Ä¶ These posts are hilarious
you know I had an idea about invading, rather taking your charater as the invader why not like become a shade of oryx, when you enter the portal. You know like you become a mini boss near the bank where you can summon thralls and as you drain there motes you summon other taken. that way its less of lawl who has heavy ammo and more like build mods and such like a summoner.
    Gonna be brutally honest here: that would probably require too much effort on Bungie‚Äôs part to implement which means it will never happen.
Should be a triumph for that honestly
    There is. It‚Äôs called ‚ÄúArmy of One‚Äù.
They were either going for some triumph, or incredibly stupid. They should have known an invade was coming and not bunched up.
I love doin stuff like this in Gambit man the invasion thing is literally meant for griefing so what else can you expect
Slapped them for nothing üíÄüíÄ
Could a solution be no exotics, or heavy as an invader?
I did that with Truth a few weeks ago, just blind luck.
Ya imma be real I'd honestly just alt f4 if this was me zero hesitation I'm so over bs like this in gambit.
Ngl, id just leave the match st that point
This is why I stopped playing gambit
Hm...yeah nah, I'm still gonna play Gambit.
They were trying to get the triumph and you fucking obliterated them :(
Wont eyes of tomorrow get buffed for damaging bosses? So will we see more of it in gambit again or is gjally still the better option?
Remove heavy ammo completely from Gambit

And before yall come at me saying "But then everyone would just whine about specials". Yes, but at least you can outplay specials consistently. Now invasions are a typical Crucible engagement, instead of being a heavy weapon slugfest.
QUAD FEED




i feel bad
Well you are not helping
I will die on the hill that gambit would be better with its difficulty scaled up and all invades removed. Competitive pve, rather than pve/PvP.
When I got gally and eyes, I felt as if I finally got my revenge but now, I am only using them to kill ads/invader so I can safely bank motes for malfeasance quest
What if killing the invader removed the shield from your primevil? And if the shield was already gone, it removed 15% of the health.
I would love a gambit mode with no invading and instead a more challenging PVE. Maybe throw overloads in the mix. Just a race to fill motes and kill all the enemies.
Disable heavy in gambit and revert the prime evil DPS phase back to what it was before witch queen to make up for no heavy. Heavy is one of the only reasons gambit is not fun and it‚Äôs crazy that bungie can‚Äôt see that.
Honestly not too bad. You just got spawned in a lucky spot with Gally. 

That being said, something like gambit prime coming back with a regulated cooldown of the invade portal would indeed be better or something else like ammo boxes spawning for the invaded team after invade ends. Just something to allow a team to recover from invades you know, to take the sting off.
Just bring back Wish Ender, no need for heavy
You had no reason to do this, your win was pretty much guaranteed.

&#x200B;

Toxic.
I would‚Äôve just left
Ew. Disgusting. Why would you do that. I mean I do but I'm not actually good. Hmmmmm.........
Bungies solution to the heavy ammo issue: give everyone more heavy

If this happened to me I would have broken the controller over my head.
I wonder if people would enjoy Gambit with heavy ammo turned off.
Honestly they've shown its nigh impossible to Bala ce invaders around heavy ammo. Just disae pulling out heavy as an invader. Make invaders get kills with special and primary. 

Or give invaders a special weapon like a scorch cannon or hive knight sword
I still remember reading that twab seeing heavy become abundant af.

Who cleared that I'll never know. Maybe it should be every 2 chest give heavy, or maybe chest don't give heavy, on High Values and then spawn more High values and change the mote requirement to 150 to get primeval, gambit prime was peak gambit, their already making the armor perks into experimental changes for gambit labs and the origin trait.

Invaders and Highpriority targets should take more damage from weapons with the trait.
Lots of people like gambit. Its not going anywhere. Get over it. Encounters like this video are straight up why i play gambit. Few things more satisfying than taking out a whole squad with one rocket.
That was a beautiful shot lol
Is this a serious post?
Did em dirty. Gj
Yea, I don't often run with gally and prefer to use my exotic slot for my other weapons like my cerebus but dam I got annoyed at one guy rocking us with gally's so i equipped mine...lets just say I didnt take it out for the next few hours lol.

Its so dam fun
    It‚Äôs just too good in all aspects of Gambit. Clears hordes of adds, can be used to invade with or kill the invader, and does good boss dps.
        Tell me about it.....It makes the campaign so much harder cause I like running around with my Masterworked trinity ghoul,
Just positing an idea here: What if heavies were disabled when invading?

Bungie themselves have admitted that the idea of the invader being this taken boogie man isn't panning out like how they wanted, and are tweaking it.

Personally, I really liked the mote thief concept, and reworking it so that invaders don't have heavies, and don't have as much health, but could steal motes and be essentially a player controlled HVT seems intriguing.

They would have to rework a lot of quests if they make invading less about killing (malfeasance for example), but it could make it more fun of a mode imo.
    It'd just lead to people complaining about different weapons. Also it's already a 1v4 where the spawn is pretty much set.
        True, but I know the mode isn't as fine tuned as it could be. I hope they focus on doing a full rework of gambit at some point (I know they did some tweaks and are doing tests now with it currently, but considering they're about to do a rework of iron banner, it would be cool to see them focus on gambit as the next thing to majorly change up with lore next).
Honestly just make heavy not usable while invading or being invaded
    Remove heavy altogether from Gambit. The primary & energy weapons still melt a boss like a runny terd on a hot tin roof in Texas on the 4th of July.
        Yeah but then people will moan about their heavy being a useless slot
Um, I‚Äôve tried doing this myself and it‚Äôs not easy to get everyone so close together to kill them with Gjallahorn. So if someone can manage that and spot an opportunity for it, I say more power to them.

This is just a silly thing to complain about.
    The enemy team was likely going for the triumph where all four people bank 15 motes together. There was no other reason for them to have not banked yet with that many motes.
        Yeah most likely which is why I think the invader just came across the perfect opportunity. I‚Äôm sure it wasn‚Äôt fun for the opposing team but in a competitive mode that‚Äôs the risk.
I go through the portal with a tractor cannon like the Chad I aspire to be.
Heavy is too OP for any invasion phase. With all this anti-easy One shot stuff going on in Crucible, how come Gambit is an exception with overabundant heavy.
    Because in gambit you are expected to fight dirty
Ya, I think invading needs a complete redesign.
    If we are being real honest, gambit in general needs a redesign.
You?
I'd of hit the fucking roof after a thousand hours in this game and probably about 400 of that in gambit doing broken quests.

I would of genuinely cursed out my team for not banking sooner and said why are you holding each others penis in gambit. then apologised inevitably because that's what gambit does


I wouldn't mind I'm not toxic in any other activity not even getting useless guys in trials I'll never say a word but gambit brings out the toxicity in me most of the time
There may have only been 3 people on the enemy team which would not allow for an army of one medal
Gallynoob in gambit

Virgin status preserved
Fucking outstanding!
Gambit is pain
&#x200B;

![gif](giphy|vcKEsYOdjoCeJRpn95)
I know we say this a lot as a joke but, I would legitimately uninstall if this happened to me
NGL, this is exactly what happens every time I play Gambit. Opposing team is always full of Gjally spammers who love invading.
I didn‚Äôt buy the 30th anniversary pack thus I don‚Äôt have Gally, thus I‚Äôll never have this ‚Äúskill‚Äù at gambit
    Any tracking rocket will do; might require two shots, but not often. Hell, you can spam buy Bad Omens from Drifter until you get tracking & cluster bomb and get the same result.
They should disable exotic weapons for gambit IMO
People who crutch on precision frame RPGs are a disappointment


I can't even be the least bit impressed with this vid tbh
    That was the whole point of this clip. Zero skill, zero effort, still a team wipe and complete loss of motes. This is every single Gambit match this season, on loop.
        You'll only get my praise when you manage to wipe a team with a primary, hell I wouldn't mind if I get clapped by a sniper, at least those require aiming
            Completely agree.  I usually invade with nothing but Night Watch and maybe an empowering rift, still get Army of One. This clip was made to show how broken Gambit is right now. If they're not invading with Gjally, then it's EoT. If not EoT, Truth. If not Truth, some other tracking rocket with 6+ rounds. The heavy economy is way too rich today.
                I also noticed that almost NOBODY uses an LMG while invading...why??
                    Clip basically spells it out, precision frame tracking rockets are so free that it‚Äôs silly to use anything but that.
                        Silly? Nah that would actually earn you respect if anything, all I see when people use those RPGs are Elmer Glue eaters
LOL
That sucks. Id be so mad but this is also hilarious
The spawns on this map are downright horrendous and I wish they kept the dreaming city map and sunset this one instead lol
Lmao pay to win weapons what a joke
That's called being a dum dum. If you get invaded and don't take action, you are not a good player either way.
LMGs really need a buff. They're pretty unusable in any game type.
Hey man, nice shot!
Their fault for being clumped so close... I always make a note to split when I hear an invader and start searching for the 'thing'. It's an automatic reaction.
To be fair, this was also a lucky shot. I couldn't tell you the last time I had an opportunity like that, where they were all clumped together, all had alot to lose, and I had a perfect line of sight/trajectory to the enemy players. This legit almost never happens. 

But also to be fair as long as heavy weapons like that exist in gambit and can be freely used like that it will honestly never not be a problem. Once you bring in pve style heavy weapon use/availability into any sort of pvp situation it becomes and entirely different ball game.
I would have came bro that‚Äôs satisfying
Which triumph? 

... and is the emblem cool?
    Where everyone dunks 15 motes at the same time.
    [Here is the Emblem: Dance The Demons Away](https://destinyemblemcollector.com/emblem?id=180108391)

It‚Äôs cool - in that almost no one seems to have it.  To nail it you had to wait until the other team invaded twice (so they couldn‚Äôt invade again and wipe your motes) but also collect the 60 motes quick enough to bank before the other team‚Äôs primeval was killed and ended the match.
        Loads of people have it. There was regular lfgs to farm for it. I've done it at least 10 times with people for a laugh.
        Me and my clan got that by accident the first week Gambit was introduced. It‚Äôs the only reason I have it lol
            Yeah, back then we made sure everyone in the clan got it ‚Äî and would even message opposing teams for a pact to allow each side to knock it out before invading. 

But that was a long time ago and the majority of Destiny‚Äôs current active player base weren‚Äôt there for the release of the new game mode called ‚ÄúGambit‚Äù ‚Ä¶which is what I mean when I say not a ton of people have it.
    Don't tempt yourself, ignorance is bliss my friend.
    [deleted]
        Dont mind me I'm just stopping by
This is why you don't converge to bank until *after* you deal with an invade (or the very least wait until the bank is no longer blocked)
Sadly the triumph and emblem have been retired.
Split the whole damn household
    lmfaoooo ain't gonna recover from that one
    Split the entire planet
        Split an atom
Shoulda gone for it during labs where there couldn‚Äôt be an invader till they deposited.
Hammerhead was the best scout rifle in the game for gambit
    I will never get rid of my hammerhead. Never
    Good times ü•≤
    hahaha!!! That took me a second
    No that would be God Roll Patron of Lost Causes or Randy's Throwing Knife at least imo

(And yes I get the joke)
        Well Hammerhead was first meta when gambit prime first came out so those two weren't going to be in the game yet for a good 6 months
ah yes Xenophage gambit...good times
    At least you had to aim...
        ...in the general direction of a target. The bullets on that thing feel like they're the size of Guardians.
            They are‚Ä¶
            It fires handheld hitscan mortars
    Those good times will be had again, when the RPM nerf gets reverted soon
Also Leviathan's breath and Thunderlord were a thing albeit less intense
    I was about to mention thunder lord. It was my go to before getting 1k back in Prime.
    I use leviathan a lot, and it's not even near the level of Gally and some others heavy.
        At least you have to aim with leviathans breath...
i remember Sleeper oh god
Then why couldn‚Äôt they just disable heavy weapons while invading? I imagine that‚Äôs not a hard feature to implement.
    Maybe a gambit labs? That‚Äôd be kinda nice.
    Disabling heavy temporarily for both the invader and the defending team could be interesting.
        Now I'm imagining someone invading while the Primeval is up to block DPS from heavies on it
            that's actually a neat idea, have invaders that try to survive as long as possible to delay dps, basically be the blocker

combine it with a massive decrease in kill healing and it sounds fun
                Cloudstrike would like to know their location
        sniper rifle moment
        No please don‚Äôt. Why are you all complaining about things that are part of the game ‚Äî why don‚Äôt Bungie just disable Destiny?!?!
            Disabling the game itself temporarily for both the invader and the defending team could be interesting.
                Haha not what I meant but that made me laugh üòÇ
        My fav take so far is that it should be disabled for PVP, but still damage in PVE. It'd prioritize the Invader and add a level of fear when you die (since you might lose your heavy), and it'd balance some of the most shit balancing issues.
    I‚Äôve personally never had issues with rockets before. Maybe because I‚Äôm usually the attacker? But even still I use my rockets for the prime evil . And I use sniper , 100%
    I would love a bunch of different modes of Gambit.  u/steddfaststedd mentioned a scorch rocket gambit. That'd be cool.  Also:  
\- Maybe a version where your heavy limitation was determined by the enemy (It's Hive! Only swords are allowed)\*

\- A version where no heavy weapons are allowed, or don't get turned on until the other team has the Primeval

\- an infinite ammo mode

\- A mode where you can carry up to 30 motes but after you get ten, you take double damage from all sources. If you bank all 30 motes it either sends two large blockers or a humongous blocker.

&#x200B;

Just some thoughts
        Summons Crota.... if all 4 bank 30 it forces the other team into the Crota Raid....
            So long as we got the banger music I would be slightly less mad. : p
Remember Queenbreaker??
I haven't played for a while but i remember using Black Talon and wiping other team without problem. Heavy exotics were always OP in gambit
21% Delirium was such a great weapon imo. I still have it in my vault.
    It's still viable in 1350 content, including most of our current raids, and all four currently available dungeons. With next season's MG buffs, you might consider pulling it out, Killing Tally's a +65% damage boost at full power.
        Damn, I didn't even think about that! I'll definitely consider it for 1350 content. A 65% dmg bonus would be niceee
            Do bear in mind that weapons are hard coded to have better damage with a higher power level, even if light advantages are not a thing. It was made like that so the forbidden duo couldn't be as powerful even in content where you could get away with equipping them.
                While you're not wrong, that power advantage caps out at +20 power, so in 1350 content there is no difference between 1370 and 1550. Based on what I'm able to find, that power advantage caps out at [roughly 13%](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sObekOYHkPDKCqAGbZcUfX9LRF0cRU4yn7m0KURY2UY/edit#gid=1575509473). Not nothing, but things like Delirium's 65% boost would still be a net gain.

Also, this whole system predates sunsetting. It is not a product of it, simply the mechanic through which it works.
                    Ah. Thank you. : )
Oh man. I remember Hammerhead when it was introduced to the game. Everyone used it to invade with.
    I still use it.
I want to see scorch rocket gambit
    Oh wow I never considered game modes for gambit, that sounds really fun actually
    I didn't know I needed that until now.
Ahhh, yes. It begun with Sir Reginald Wardcliff... But not long came The King Sleeper, countered by the Queen's Breaker, rested control from by the Truth tracker, Simply to be outdone by the Bringer of Death, but once there is death, comes a genophage of Xeno scum, only for the god of sight to completely dominate the field... Only for it's father to return upon bungie breaking it's knees.
Disable heavy and supers as soon as you go through the portal to invade. There, I just fixed Gambit.
    Too logical  for them üòÇüòÇüòÇ
    Disable supers for the enemy team while you're at it. I.e no supers at all for anyone anytime period
    No, keep supers but have certain times when they're disabled. If they want to spend supers on invaders when in Primeval phase, let them. You can't get them back like you can rockets and it'll allow last ditch efforts to clutch.
I honestly wonder how people would feel if the Heavy slot got locked during Gambit.
Heavy gets disabled on invade. That would help instead of nerfing each weapon.
Delirium and Hammerhead were honestly fine. I hate the instant crossmap death more
    That‚Äôs what I mentioned them for. They were heavy scout/snipers lol
As a old sleeper gambit vet yea the one with heavys can kill and destory the team quickly.
At least some of those required more skill. Eyes and gjally are the two that shouldn‚Äôt be in there.
    ah yes skillful xeno with bullets with a hitbox the size of atheon
        Omar can‚Äôt track like the other two.
    None of those required ‚Äúskill‚Äù they all hit the target no matter how far you were and one shot them. That‚Äôs what made them broken and eventually got them nerfed.
        I firmly believe in an exotic rotation in gambit.
Been confused about that since I only started playing the updated Gambit recently. The new crates make it even easier to get heavy ammo, not sure how that was supposed to help.
    It‚Äôs not the heavy crates. It‚Äôs the heavy‚Äôs one general. When one gets nerfed or a new one becomes the meta (xeno eyes and heir) will return to dominate in season 17. That‚Äôs the issue. I‚Äôm the past we also had taken and fallen armaments that gave heavy. Sadly it will never NOT be heavy weapon invade influenced
        Fair, I just meant making it easier to get the ammo exacerbates the situation. Before you had that one crate that only one person could get ammo from, now it seems to load every time you clean out an area, and the whole team can get ammo
It‚Äôs not an issue. We need to stop saying it is ‚Äî the exotics offer a perk that we should be able to take advantage of. I haven‚Äôt been able to pull off what‚Äôs shown in this video carrying a Gjallahorn into Gambit that easily.
They would have died to a single cloudstike shot. Bottom line dont stack when the invader shows up.
The issue is in every game mode is heavy way to much. Yes that‚Äôs sounds winy but be honest how many times have you been killed in the crucible by G-horn? I get it I could use it too but I don‚Äôt like it to use this gun in PvP for trials heavy should be disabled all along‚Ä¶ especially when you are not on the same light level like your opponents>.< I definitely know most people will disagree
    Can‚Äôt compare crucible though. Different modes and correct me if I‚Äôm wrong. If you die in gambit you don‚Äôt lose heavy. But even if they take heavy back out. You will still get drops regardless. Not everyone but enough to melt your prime
        I wonder if it would be possible to lock heavy during the invade phase so you can‚Äôt use it against players :D
            I don‚Äôt think it would be well received. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs still in all crucible modes. Even in mayhem a super based mode lol
I miss Delirium. I hope the Ritual Weapon 2 seasons from now is an MG with a tweaked Killing Tally. Such a good perk (I assume next season is a Trace Rifle due to the inbound Trace Rifle buffs and I assume Killing Tally would be tweaked due to power creep it could cause compared to other damage perks if it wasn't)
And then you finally get to someone and they bean you with the craziest sniper flick headshot of all time
    I‚Äôve been hit by some pretty bullshit, mind reading type of sniper headshots when I invade. Like, I‚Äôm pretty sure they were using a wall hack or something because of how quickly and accurately they are able to dome an invader at all times.
        I can say with a certainty that if you spend way too much on Gambit (like I did since Shadowkeep), it is very easy to predict where the invader is spawning based on the combatant spawn zones and the position of the rest of your team.

So its not more of a wall hack rather than the game spawning you in a very predictable place and any seasoned player would correctly identify where you jumped in more times than not and send you back real soon.
            Up until it spawns the invader with the enemies
            I just wish the game would say where the invader is in bound from. I'm not going to take the time to memorize invader spawn points for a mode I view as a chore.
            That has nothing to do with someone constantly doming the invader no matter where they are. Even after the invader has moved around, they will get immediately domed over and over.
                that's called skill gap.

Honestly, its not hard to find an invader, they are only hard to counter when they catch you off-guard with their heavy.
                     No, it‚Äôs most likely called wall hacks.
                        sure mate.
                            I can‚Äôt count the number of times I‚Äôve been 360 no scoped no matter where I am on the map. But sure, chalk every single one up to ‚Äúskill.‚Äù Lol
                                "360 no-scoped"

maybe you are letting them hit 360 no scopes with your piss awful invading.

I don't chalk it up to skill issue every time, but the fact that you say you can't count the number of times is just saying that you die a lot and blame it on wall hacks.
        There are some videos on invader spawn kills. Less mind read and more mechanic exploitation and invader not being ready for it
            No, I mean, they legit like 360 no scope me no matter where I‚Äôm standing. Even if I‚Äôve already moved from the spawn point.
        The Herod-C Auto Rifle has an invader tracker trait that marks the opposing invader for you and your team if you land a hit on them. It's pretty much legal wall hacks. If you have a general idea on how the spawn mechanics work then you'll more than likely be able to mark invaders instantly and your team will be prepared to shoot instead of blindly hopping around trying to locate the invader.
            Oh I know. I use that gun a lot in freelance to help my team spot the invader (because blueberries). But a lot of the situations I‚Äôm personally referring to, I took no damage from anything beforehand and purposely went out of the way to pop my head around places where you normally wouldn‚Äôt expect an invader and would still get instantly domed.
                ahhh okay, then definitely wall hacks XD
Exactly.
And if they saw you first be ready to get bonked with rockets and snipers
    It‚Äôs definitely the worst when the moment they hear invader they go to all the different spawn points waiting with their Gjhorn, Sleeper etc. waiting for you or even prefiring as the weapon will do the rest.
Yep. When I invade, the portal almost always puts me in the worst place imaginable for an invader. I usually have to hoof it a good 10 seconds or so before I even get a shot at someone.
I found it a bit more frequent last labs. Plenty of team's coordinating 60 banked from ~20 to try to skip enemy portals.

But still- OP had *all* the stars aligned here lol
Also Truth and EoT.

They're the source of pretty much all my gambit frustration. 



Oh, and that guy who banks 7 motes after the first wave of enemies.
    Or worse, the guy who banks 4 motes.
        I‚Äôd rather someone bank 4 motes than someone clean up the rest of the enemy wave when they can already bank those motes (it‚Äôs Primeaval time)
            Oh well yeah, in that case of course :) I just meant banking 4 motes after the first wave, like in the beginning of the game :)
    I had a match where one dude invade with Thruth like 3 times and he always had a rocket ready for each of my teammates. I hated that match
Nah if invaders dont get heavy they just get perma shit on by 4 people with heavy lmao, just disable heavy as a whole in gambit
    I could get behind that.
        Its not like we need heavy anyway, we got great dps options in special and kinetic, all heavy does is speed up the boss phase and ruin the pvp aspect of gambit
    Disable heavy for everyone on the side where an invasion is in progress, that way people can still use em for PvE stuff freely.
        That could be fun.

Tryna DPS the boss? Lemme invade so you can't use your stupid exotic rocket launchers.
            Oooohhhh interesting. As a gambit lover I could hella get behind this.
    The problem is the boss. It would take forever to beat the boss without heavy.
        You could just lower the health of the boss
            You could also just disable invading. But both seem key to the game mode for some odd reason.
                Why would you want to disable invading?
                    Why would you want to lower the health of the boss?
                        So that heavy can be gone? Without it being an issue?
                            Seems like heavy is only an issue because of invaders. 

Listen I'm going to speed up this conversation. 

Your likely response, if you are like anyone else I've had this conversation with, is along the lines of "But invading is a core game mechanic for Gambit. It's the only mode that combines PvE and PvP!"

Yup, I don't disagree.

But so is the boss fight. 

I don't think nerfing the boss fight is any more valid than removing the concept of invaders entirely. Heavy is important to the boss fight, but damaging for overall Gambit health during invasions. That's the core balance problem of the entire game mode. Hypothetically if invasions were not a thing, using heavy ammo strategically would still be hugely important. 

I don't think it's a valid tweak to the game to remove heavy ammo entirely.
Block both team heavy during an invade but boost the invader (more resistance and more damage)

It would also make invades more impactful during the boss phase
Would you Blame them? üòî
    I assume you‚Äôre being sarcastic. But yes, I would blame them. Never back out, always comeback and win. Always try.

Edit: id never leave my team. 100 to 0 i would never give up on my team like that.
        I mean I wasnt really sarcastic. In my experience with Gambit since Forsaken is: "You loose too much at the start? Theres no coming back" 

How new Gambit plays out in my experience: "You loose too much at the start? Theres no coming back. You did pretty good and got x6 on the primeval while the enemy is just spawning theirs? You will still loose" 

I dont leave the match when we are mid-way to near the end... But if it happens at the start... Theres no recovery, at least in the games Ive done theres none a recovery, just a drawn out and painful defeat.
            The game is almost over anyway, just camp the portal and piss them off for the rest of the game.
            I‚Äôve come back from being way down with a teammate who would invade and get a couple of kills each time. It was a great feeling of accomplishment winning that.
Im sorry you guys rob yourselves of that experience by quitting.
                sadly for me the grind is more of a chore than reward. Lately ive been feeling forced to grind, say for example gambit just to get the shotgun skin and the seasonal challenge. Id be playing for the grind and not having fun, its a vicious cycle I dont like :(
                    This is me in crucible. I had 2 matches where I didn‚Äôt score a single point in freelance IB. It was a terrible experience. I still gave it my all and didn‚Äôt give up because my teammates at least deserve that from me. For the record I think only one or 2 teammates had a point those matches..
Or PvE player.
That would work if the entire enemy team wouldn‚Äôt just barrage the invader with Gjally. Problem still comes back to heavy weapons.
    Just give everyone 1 half load of their heavy weapon. Once it's gone, it's gone forever so use your shots wisely. 

Would add some actual thought behind heavy usage instead of "see enemy, send ghorn rocket their way"
        Maybe. But that Only draws primeval fights longer since heavy is 99% how you deal Damage to the Boss. Specially with this new gambo system
    True
    Someone had a really good idea about it. Once someone invades, that place gets their heavy blocked for the remain time of invading.

So when you invade, you or the enemy team cant use heavy at all until invader dies/leaves.
    I think the problem comes back to Destiny‚Äôs TTK in anything PvP related
    They could theoretically just do that now, but most randies I get matched with won‚Äôt even engage the Invader.
Taken Blight relic. I‚Äôve always said the invader should just become ‚Äútaken‚Äù and have the blight relic. It can still shoot and use the grenade for an AoE burst, but i think that could be interesting.
    If they allow the invader to get close enough to do the grenade burst then they deserve to get one shot.
        That‚Äôs my exact point! ;D
I thought Invasion swap did a good job with this honestly. You could predict to a certain extent when the enemy would enter the portal and be somewhat ready for it while also limiting the ability for a good invade to utterly decimate a team from ever coming back.

Invasion Swap labs honestly was the best feeling Gambit to date.
I usually try to gild Dredgen. Not this season. Cant stay alive one full game with so much 'gorn
    Heck, I'm just trying to get dredgen finished this season. only thing I need is Thrillmonger and every time we get invaded I just know I'm gonna die.
        An idea could be to just kill stuff quickly and use mobility. Or use things to be protected like the titan flan glaive (pocket WoD). Basically your priority would be to survive and kill, not so much grab motes.
        If you have it, try doing the Witherhoard/IKELOS SMG combo with warmind cells. Warmind cells don't have the reach they used to have but they can still kill shit quickly. That and BTDB. Helped me get Thrillmonger quickly.
            Unfortunately I don't have Shadowkeep (or 30th Aniv/WQ) which I probably should. I am aware that Witherhoard would let me easily get Thrillmonger. Currently using Agers+Ikelos SMG. Forgot about Warmind cells though, was wondering why everyone was saying an average SMG was good, your comment made me realise why.
                Ager's works too.
Then people will spam things like erianas and jotunn, remove one thing and another will be found
    Pretty sure nobody is going to be particularly afraid of Jotunn spam.
        I mean I guess, but there are other weapons that will dominate the enemy team
            Darci meta when?
                Lmao, seriously tho I hope bungie does something with darci, it has a nice theme and a very cool look,and I simple rework of the weapon would do it wonders
                    I think it just got power crept to obscurity. I think a modest buff in damage with a touch of precision damage bonus could do wonders for it, maybe add triple tap too. Right now I don't think it performs better than a kinetic legendary, while taking up a heavy exotic slot.
                        Actually, with the new airborn accuracy trait bungie will be adding, I feel like there‚Äôs potential here, perhaps darci could have the best in air accuracy in the game, whilst having some other things, like the triple tap you mentioned and maybe the ability to keep your tracker while aiming down the sight
                            Quite frankly they could simply move it to the kinetic slot and it'd probably be fantastic, especially getting that 10% damage bonus there and being a special weapon
                                Ya, but idk it feels like it would brake something idk
From someone who's been killed by gjally more than a few times in gambit, it's more of a tactical problem.  Don't group up. Otherwise easy pickings.
    the main problem with gjally is the tracking, it tracks way too hard, its not because people are constantly grouped up
        If only there were things between you and the opponent that could break the tracking...

Damn those wide open maps with zero cover
            Yeah I totally haven't been killed behind cover, multiple times, via a direct hit, because of the tracking.
                Let me just hide behind this small rock and hope the 7 tracking rockets don't find me... using things like buildings or cover to break tracking just wouldn't be sporting.



Do you have any game sense at all?
                    Yeah, a small rock is what I was hiding behind. 

Have you watched ghorn gameplay at all?
                        Yeah and it's always people who think every encounter in this game has to be open gun fight with no strategy, just run at the enemy and hope for the best...

Like the crucible.

Exotics aren't gambits biggest problem. It's the morons who fill the playlist trying to bot thier way to a cheap pinnacle.
                            I mean. Even if the Rocket hits your cover instead of you. Wolfpack Rounds go over the cover and hit you anyways. 

Move away? The invader is still in the field, and if that first Rocket didnt kill you the second one on the chamber likely Will.
                                Which would be a problem if the maps were open, which they're not. 

People just don't learn the maps because they don't care about the gamemode, they just want to idgaf thier way to a pinnacle. The amount of these videos complaining about heavy in gambit and its a dude standing in the open or hiding behind the bank. 

There is only 4 maps. Each with 3 fronts and a central bank. Each front has a sightline to the bank but not to the other fronts. An invader can only spawn in a front without enemies. Both teams are guaranteed heavy. He knows where you are but its a 4v1 and even if your team doesn't know where he spawned and splits up it would still be a 2v1 with both sides having heavy. Its not rocket science.
    I see you did not do the assignment which was watching the video.
        I did, and if you give an example when others are farther away from each other and it tracks better than it should, you will have a better example to show everyone. Otherwise, much to everyone who down voted me, it is still mostly a grouping problem with that clip.
            >it is still mostly a grouping problem with that clip

`Be me`

`Playing Gambit with a couple of the homies`

`See that there is a triumph when we bank 60 at once`

`By god we get 15 each and book it to the bank to get them in before an invade`

`Some scrub with gjally comes in and within 3 seconds of invading mercs all 4 of us before we can bank with 1 rocket`

`"It's mostly a grouping problem." "You shouldn't all group up, especially when you have that many motes." "I can't believe that you'd commit such a grievous oversight." "Your team sucks because you couldn't adjust your tactics when someone invaded." "You really should get gud."`

Personally, I'm not *that* invested, but Gjallarhorn presents a braindead-easy way to kill all of the opposing team. As someone who "who's been killed by gjally more than a few times in gambit," you probably are aware there really isn't a whole lot you can do, unless you out play the invader so bad it's embarrassing. In this video specifically, without Gjally or EoT, that team would have banked 99/100 times with the invade coming in when it did.  (Source: I reset my Gambit rank 3x during Arrivals and have done it 5x since.)

Gjally has an issue that I think should be addressed, do I have the answer? Not really, because I'm not a game dev and don't really know how that shit works.
It‚Äôs a problem in crucible as well. It‚Äôs better than wardcliff somehow
I really liked gambit prime back in the day. I was a gambit addict. Invading was my specialty. My buddy was a collector. I miss that mode. 

Gambit is... It feels more casual now for lack of better words. Yes there are heavy spams and whole teams of g horn at times it's not a shit show... Usually. Sleeper used to wreak havock along with truth. I won't miss those days.
no motes to bank?
- Get rid of invading

*What*???
    Yes..  Make it a boss burn race. Some people hate/despise pvp and others who love pvp despise Gambit. This is why it's a shit game mode. Not to mention for the time invested it's virtually pointless outside of nerd points.
    Yes. It is the single most annoying mechanic in the game mode.
        ????

I love the mechanic itself. Killing the Invader makes me feel actually awesome, because I was able to use my kit to take them down even though they had the advantage. As well, I \*love\* invading, and I always heap praise on my teammates when they get them. When I'm invading, it makes me feel amazing to manage a team-wipe. 

What I hate is heavy weapons. Because it makes invasions pointless to fight against, or makes it pointless to invade if you aren't using the meta (Xeno, for instance). Like I typically get 12-16 kills in Gambit and I've been killed by Chain of Command and Xeno that I've focused on unlocking both just so I can use them
Then how would you do fast strong dps?
    Using khostkov of course
    Special ammo and abilities
He got the shot off almost immediately after the invasion notification. The vast majority of players would not have reacted that fast regardless. Stop blaming shitty game design on the players.
    If only there were two giant bars at the top of the screen that showed exactly the amount of motes both were holding and have deposited??????????

Stop making excuses for small brain players who ignore basic game mechanics
        That literally does nothing for the fact that he basically got an immediate, free shot a second after invading. Just because you can see that the event team *can* invade, doesn‚Äôt mean they will.
There's a triumph for a 4√ó15 bank, they were probably going for that
Yeah and they all bunched up at the bank trying to clear the blockers. Man, blueberries...
Despite the fact that I hate Gambit and always have, this is actually a decent take. 

The game mode itself is a good concept with some decent bare bones, but it exists in a sandbox that rewards you so much for doing so little. Gambit itself is not the problem, but rather the sandbox that it's being played in. But the sandbox can't be balanced around Gambit because then that screws up the rest of the game...

&#x200B;

Gambit needs a separate sandbox, built from scratch if it's ever going to work. Too bad that'll never happen...
Gonna be brutally honest here: that would probably require too much effort on Bungie‚Äôs part to implement which means it will never happen.
There is. It‚Äôs called ‚ÄúArmy of One‚Äù.

It‚Äôs just too good in all aspects of Gambit. Clears hordes of adds, can be used to invade with or kill the invader, and does good boss dps.
    Tell me about it.....It makes the campaign so much harder cause I like running around with my Masterworked trinity ghoul,
It'd just lead to people complaining about different weapons. Also it's already a 1v4 where the spawn is pretty much set.
    True, but I know the mode isn't as fine tuned as it could be. I hope they focus on doing a full rework of gambit at some point (I know they did some tweaks and are doing tests now with it currently, but considering they're about to do a rework of iron banner, it would be cool to see them focus on gambit as the next thing to majorly change up with lore next).
Remove heavy altogether from Gambit. The primary & energy weapons still melt a boss like a runny terd on a hot tin roof in Texas on the 4th of July.
    Yeah but then people will moan about their heavy being a useless slot
The enemy team was likely going for the triumph where all four people bank 15 motes together. There was no other reason for them to have not banked yet with that many motes.
    Yeah most likely which is why I think the invader just came across the perfect opportunity. I‚Äôm sure it wasn‚Äôt fun for the opposing team but in a competitive mode that‚Äôs the risk.
Because in gambit you are expected to fight dirty
If we are being real honest, gambit in general needs a redesign.
Any tracking rocket will do; might require two shots, but not often. Hell, you can spam buy Bad Omens from Drifter until you get tracking & cluster bomb and get the same result.
That was the whole point of this clip. Zero skill, zero effort, still a team wipe and complete loss of motes. This is every single Gambit match this season, on loop.
    You'll only get my praise when you manage to wipe a team with a primary, hell I wouldn't mind if I get clapped by a sniper, at least those require aiming
        Completely agree.  I usually invade with nothing but Night Watch and maybe an empowering rift, still get Army of One. This clip was made to show how broken Gambit is right now. If they're not invading with Gjally, then it's EoT. If not EoT, Truth. If not Truth, some other tracking rocket with 6+ rounds. The heavy economy is way too rich today.
            I also noticed that almost NOBODY uses an LMG while invading...why??
                Clip basically spells it out, precision frame tracking rockets are so free that it‚Äôs silly to use anything but that.
                    Silly? Nah that would actually earn you respect if anything, all I see when people use those RPGs are Elmer Glue eaters
Where everyone dunks 15 motes at the same time.
[Here is the Emblem: Dance The Demons Away](https://destinyemblemcollector.com/emblem?id=180108391)

It‚Äôs cool - in that almost no one seems to have it.  To nail it you had to wait until the other team invaded twice (so they couldn‚Äôt invade again and wipe your motes) but also collect the 60 motes quick enough to bank before the other team‚Äôs primeval was killed and ended the match.
    Loads of people have it. There was regular lfgs to farm for it. I've done it at least 10 times with people for a laugh.
    Me and my clan got that by accident the first week Gambit was introduced. It‚Äôs the only reason I have it lol
        Yeah, back then we made sure everyone in the clan got it ‚Äî and would even message opposing teams for a pact to allow each side to knock it out before invading. 

But that was a long time ago and the majority of Destiny‚Äôs current active player base weren‚Äôt there for the release of the new game mode called ‚ÄúGambit‚Äù ‚Ä¶which is what I mean when I say not a ton of people have it.
Don't tempt yourself, ignorance is bliss my friend.
[deleted]
    Dont mind me I'm just stopping by
lmfaoooo ain't gonna recover from that one
Split the entire planet
    Split an atom
I will never get rid of my hammerhead. Never
Good times ü•≤
hahaha!!! That took me a second
No that would be God Roll Patron of Lost Causes or Randy's Throwing Knife at least imo

(And yes I get the joke)
    Well Hammerhead was first meta when gambit prime first came out so those two weren't going to be in the game yet for a good 6 months
At least you had to aim...
    ...in the general direction of a target. The bullets on that thing feel like they're the size of Guardians.
        They are‚Ä¶
        It fires handheld hitscan mortars
Those good times will be had again, when the RPM nerf gets reverted soon
I was about to mention thunder lord. It was my go to before getting 1k back in Prime.
I use leviathan a lot, and it's not even near the level of Gally and some others heavy.
    At least you have to aim with leviathans breath...
Maybe a gambit labs? That‚Äôd be kinda nice.
Disabling heavy temporarily for both the invader and the defending team could be interesting.
    Now I'm imagining someone invading while the Primeval is up to block DPS from heavies on it
        that's actually a neat idea, have invaders that try to survive as long as possible to delay dps, basically be the blocker

combine it with a massive decrease in kill healing and it sounds fun
            Cloudstrike would like to know their location
    sniper rifle moment
    No please don‚Äôt. Why are you all complaining about things that are part of the game ‚Äî why don‚Äôt Bungie just disable Destiny?!?!
        Disabling the game itself temporarily for both the invader and the defending team could be interesting.
            Haha not what I meant but that made me laugh üòÇ
    My fav take so far is that it should be disabled for PVP, but still damage in PVE. It'd prioritize the Invader and add a level of fear when you die (since you might lose your heavy), and it'd balance some of the most shit balancing issues.
I‚Äôve personally never had issues with rockets before. Maybe because I‚Äôm usually the attacker? But even still I use my rockets for the prime evil . And I use sniper , 100%
I would love a bunch of different modes of Gambit.  u/steddfaststedd mentioned a scorch rocket gambit. That'd be cool.  Also:  
\- Maybe a version where your heavy limitation was determined by the enemy (It's Hive! Only swords are allowed)\*

\- A version where no heavy weapons are allowed, or don't get turned on until the other team has the Primeval

\- an infinite ammo mode

\- A mode where you can carry up to 30 motes but after you get ten, you take double damage from all sources. If you bank all 30 motes it either sends two large blockers or a humongous blocker.

&#x200B;

Just some thoughts
    Summons Crota.... if all 4 bank 30 it forces the other team into the Crota Raid....
        So long as we got the banger music I would be slightly less mad. : p
It's still viable in 1350 content, including most of our current raids, and all four currently available dungeons. With next season's MG buffs, you might consider pulling it out, Killing Tally's a +65% damage boost at full power.
    Damn, I didn't even think about that! I'll definitely consider it for 1350 content. A 65% dmg bonus would be niceee
        Do bear in mind that weapons are hard coded to have better damage with a higher power level, even if light advantages are not a thing. It was made like that so the forbidden duo couldn't be as powerful even in content where you could get away with equipping them.
            While you're not wrong, that power advantage caps out at +20 power, so in 1350 content there is no difference between 1370 and 1550. Based on what I'm able to find, that power advantage caps out at [roughly 13%](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sObekOYHkPDKCqAGbZcUfX9LRF0cRU4yn7m0KURY2UY/edit#gid=1575509473). Not nothing, but things like Delirium's 65% boost would still be a net gain.

Also, this whole system predates sunsetting. It is not a product of it, simply the mechanic through which it works.
                Ah. Thank you. : )
I still use it.
Oh wow I never considered game modes for gambit, that sounds really fun actually
I didn't know I needed that until now.
Too logical  for them üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Disable supers for the enemy team while you're at it. I.e no supers at all for anyone anytime period
No, keep supers but have certain times when they're disabled. If they want to spend supers on invaders when in Primeval phase, let them. You can't get them back like you can rockets and it'll allow last ditch efforts to clutch.
That‚Äôs what I mentioned them for. They were heavy scout/snipers lol
ah yes skillful xeno with bullets with a hitbox the size of atheon
    Omar can‚Äôt track like the other two.
None of those required ‚Äúskill‚Äù they all hit the target no matter how far you were and one shot them. That‚Äôs what made them broken and eventually got them nerfed.
    I firmly believe in an exotic rotation in gambit.
It‚Äôs not the heavy crates. It‚Äôs the heavy‚Äôs one general. When one gets nerfed or a new one becomes the meta (xeno eyes and heir) will return to dominate in season 17. That‚Äôs the issue. I‚Äôm the past we also had taken and fallen armaments that gave heavy. Sadly it will never NOT be heavy weapon invade influenced
    Fair, I just meant making it easier to get the ammo exacerbates the situation. Before you had that one crate that only one person could get ammo from, now it seems to load every time you clean out an area, and the whole team can get ammo
Can‚Äôt compare crucible though. Different modes and correct me if I‚Äôm wrong. If you die in gambit you don‚Äôt lose heavy. But even if they take heavy back out. You will still get drops regardless. Not everyone but enough to melt your prime
    I wonder if it would be possible to lock heavy during the invade phase so you can‚Äôt use it against players :D
        I don‚Äôt think it would be well received. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs still in all crucible modes. Even in mayhem a super based mode lol
I‚Äôve been hit by some pretty bullshit, mind reading type of sniper headshots when I invade. Like, I‚Äôm pretty sure they were using a wall hack or something because of how quickly and accurately they are able to dome an invader at all times.
    I can say with a certainty that if you spend way too much on Gambit (like I did since Shadowkeep), it is very easy to predict where the invader is spawning based on the combatant spawn zones and the position of the rest of your team.

So its not more of a wall hack rather than the game spawning you in a very predictable place and any seasoned player would correctly identify where you jumped in more times than not and send you back real soon.
        Up until it spawns the invader with the enemies
        I just wish the game would say where the invader is in bound from. I'm not going to take the time to memorize invader spawn points for a mode I view as a chore.
        That has nothing to do with someone constantly doming the invader no matter where they are. Even after the invader has moved around, they will get immediately domed over and over.
            that's called skill gap.

Honestly, its not hard to find an invader, they are only hard to counter when they catch you off-guard with their heavy.
                 No, it‚Äôs most likely called wall hacks.
                    sure mate.
                        I can‚Äôt count the number of times I‚Äôve been 360 no scoped no matter where I am on the map. But sure, chalk every single one up to ‚Äúskill.‚Äù Lol
                            "360 no-scoped"

maybe you are letting them hit 360 no scopes with your piss awful invading.

I don't chalk it up to skill issue every time, but the fact that you say you can't count the number of times is just saying that you die a lot and blame it on wall hacks.
    There are some videos on invader spawn kills. Less mind read and more mechanic exploitation and invader not being ready for it
        No, I mean, they legit like 360 no scope me no matter where I‚Äôm standing. Even if I‚Äôve already moved from the spawn point.
    The Herod-C Auto Rifle has an invader tracker trait that marks the opposing invader for you and your team if you land a hit on them. It's pretty much legal wall hacks. If you have a general idea on how the spawn mechanics work then you'll more than likely be able to mark invaders instantly and your team will be prepared to shoot instead of blindly hopping around trying to locate the invader.
        Oh I know. I use that gun a lot in freelance to help my team spot the invader (because blueberries). But a lot of the situations I‚Äôm personally referring to, I took no damage from anything beforehand and purposely went out of the way to pop my head around places where you normally wouldn‚Äôt expect an invader and would still get instantly domed.
            ahhh okay, then definitely wall hacks XD
It‚Äôs definitely the worst when the moment they hear invader they go to all the different spawn points waiting with their Gjhorn, Sleeper etc. waiting for you or even prefiring as the weapon will do the rest.
Or worse, the guy who banks 4 motes.
    I‚Äôd rather someone bank 4 motes than someone clean up the rest of the enemy wave when they can already bank those motes (it‚Äôs Primeaval time)
        Oh well yeah, in that case of course :) I just meant banking 4 motes after the first wave, like in the beginning of the game :)
I had a match where one dude invade with Thruth like 3 times and he always had a rocket ready for each of my teammates. I hated that match
I could get behind that.
    Its not like we need heavy anyway, we got great dps options in special and kinetic, all heavy does is speed up the boss phase and ruin the pvp aspect of gambit
Disable heavy for everyone on the side where an invasion is in progress, that way people can still use em for PvE stuff freely.
    That could be fun.

Tryna DPS the boss? Lemme invade so you can't use your stupid exotic rocket launchers.
        Oooohhhh interesting. As a gambit lover I could hella get behind this.
The problem is the boss. It would take forever to beat the boss without heavy.
    You could just lower the health of the boss
        You could also just disable invading. But both seem key to the game mode for some odd reason.
            Why would you want to disable invading?
                Why would you want to lower the health of the boss?
                    So that heavy can be gone? Without it being an issue?
                        Seems like heavy is only an issue because of invaders. 

Listen I'm going to speed up this conversation. 

Your likely response, if you are like anyone else I've had this conversation with, is along the lines of "But invading is a core game mechanic for Gambit. It's the only mode that combines PvE and PvP!"

Yup, I don't disagree.

But so is the boss fight. 

I don't think nerfing the boss fight is any more valid than removing the concept of invaders entirely. Heavy is important to the boss fight, but damaging for overall Gambit health during invasions. That's the core balance problem of the entire game mode. Hypothetically if invasions were not a thing, using heavy ammo strategically would still be hugely important. 

I don't think it's a valid tweak to the game to remove heavy ammo entirely.
I assume you‚Äôre being sarcastic. But yes, I would blame them. Never back out, always comeback and win. Always try.

Edit: id never leave my team. 100 to 0 i would never give up on my team like that.
    I mean I wasnt really sarcastic. In my experience with Gambit since Forsaken is: "You loose too much at the start? Theres no coming back" 

How new Gambit plays out in my experience: "You loose too much at the start? Theres no coming back. You did pretty good and got x6 on the primeval while the enemy is just spawning theirs? You will still loose" 

I dont leave the match when we are mid-way to near the end... But if it happens at the start... Theres no recovery, at least in the games Ive done theres none a recovery, just a drawn out and painful defeat.
        The game is almost over anyway, just camp the portal and piss them off for the rest of the game.
        I‚Äôve come back from being way down with a teammate who would invade and get a couple of kills each time. It was a great feeling of accomplishment winning that.
Im sorry you guys rob yourselves of that experience by quitting.
            sadly for me the grind is more of a chore than reward. Lately ive been feeling forced to grind, say for example gambit just to get the shotgun skin and the seasonal challenge. Id be playing for the grind and not having fun, its a vicious cycle I dont like :(
                This is me in crucible. I had 2 matches where I didn‚Äôt score a single point in freelance IB. It was a terrible experience. I still gave it my all and didn‚Äôt give up because my teammates at least deserve that from me. For the record I think only one or 2 teammates had a point those matches..
Just give everyone 1 half load of their heavy weapon. Once it's gone, it's gone forever so use your shots wisely. 

Would add some actual thought behind heavy usage instead of "see enemy, send ghorn rocket their way"
    Maybe. But that Only draws primeval fights longer since heavy is 99% how you deal Damage to the Boss. Specially with this new gambo system
True
Someone had a really good idea about it. Once someone invades, that place gets their heavy blocked for the remain time of invading.

So when you invade, you or the enemy team cant use heavy at all until invader dies/leaves.
I think the problem comes back to Destiny‚Äôs TTK in anything PvP related
They could theoretically just do that now, but most randies I get matched with won‚Äôt even engage the Invader.
If they allow the invader to get close enough to do the grenade burst then they deserve to get one shot.
    That‚Äôs my exact point! ;D
Heck, I'm just trying to get dredgen finished this season. only thing I need is Thrillmonger and every time we get invaded I just know I'm gonna die.
    An idea could be to just kill stuff quickly and use mobility. Or use things to be protected like the titan flan glaive (pocket WoD). Basically your priority would be to survive and kill, not so much grab motes.
    If you have it, try doing the Witherhoard/IKELOS SMG combo with warmind cells. Warmind cells don't have the reach they used to have but they can still kill shit quickly. That and BTDB. Helped me get Thrillmonger quickly.
        Unfortunately I don't have Shadowkeep (or 30th Aniv/WQ) which I probably should. I am aware that Witherhoard would let me easily get Thrillmonger. Currently using Agers+Ikelos SMG. Forgot about Warmind cells though, was wondering why everyone was saying an average SMG was good, your comment made me realise why.
            Ager's works too.
Pretty sure nobody is going to be particularly afraid of Jotunn spam.
    I mean I guess, but there are other weapons that will dominate the enemy team
        Darci meta when?
            Lmao, seriously tho I hope bungie does something with darci, it has a nice theme and a very cool look,and I simple rework of the weapon would do it wonders
                I think it just got power crept to obscurity. I think a modest buff in damage with a touch of precision damage bonus could do wonders for it, maybe add triple tap too. Right now I don't think it performs better than a kinetic legendary, while taking up a heavy exotic slot.
                    Actually, with the new airborn accuracy trait bungie will be adding, I feel like there‚Äôs potential here, perhaps darci could have the best in air accuracy in the game, whilst having some other things, like the triple tap you mentioned and maybe the ability to keep your tracker while aiming down the sight
                        Quite frankly they could simply move it to the kinetic slot and it'd probably be fantastic, especially getting that 10% damage bonus there and being a special weapon
                            Ya, but idk it feels like it would brake something idk
the main problem with gjally is the tracking, it tracks way too hard, its not because people are constantly grouped up
    If only there were things between you and the opponent that could break the tracking...

Damn those wide open maps with zero cover
        Yeah I totally haven't been killed behind cover, multiple times, via a direct hit, because of the tracking.
            Let me just hide behind this small rock and hope the 7 tracking rockets don't find me... using things like buildings or cover to break tracking just wouldn't be sporting.



Do you have any game sense at all?
                Yeah, a small rock is what I was hiding behind. 

Have you watched ghorn gameplay at all?
                    Yeah and it's always people who think every encounter in this game has to be open gun fight with no strategy, just run at the enemy and hope for the best...

Like the crucible.

Exotics aren't gambits biggest problem. It's the morons who fill the playlist trying to bot thier way to a cheap pinnacle.
                        I mean. Even if the Rocket hits your cover instead of you. Wolfpack Rounds go over the cover and hit you anyways. 

Move away? The invader is still in the field, and if that first Rocket didnt kill you the second one on the chamber likely Will.
                            Which would be a problem if the maps were open, which they're not. 

People just don't learn the maps because they don't care about the gamemode, they just want to idgaf thier way to a pinnacle. The amount of these videos complaining about heavy in gambit and its a dude standing in the open or hiding behind the bank. 

There is only 4 maps. Each with 3 fronts and a central bank. Each front has a sightline to the bank but not to the other fronts. An invader can only spawn in a front without enemies. Both teams are guaranteed heavy. He knows where you are but its a 4v1 and even if your team doesn't know where he spawned and splits up it would still be a 2v1 with both sides having heavy. Its not rocket science.
I see you did not do the assignment which was watching the video.
    I did, and if you give an example when others are farther away from each other and it tracks better than it should, you will have a better example to show everyone. Otherwise, much to everyone who down voted me, it is still mostly a grouping problem with that clip.
        >it is still mostly a grouping problem with that clip

`Be me`

`Playing Gambit with a couple of the homies`

`See that there is a triumph when we bank 60 at once`

`By god we get 15 each and book it to the bank to get them in before an invade`

`Some scrub with gjally comes in and within 3 seconds of invading mercs all 4 of us before we can bank with 1 rocket`

`"It's mostly a grouping problem." "You shouldn't all group up, especially when you have that many motes." "I can't believe that you'd commit such a grievous oversight." "Your team sucks because you couldn't adjust your tactics when someone invaded." "You really should get gud."`

Personally, I'm not *that* invested, but Gjallarhorn presents a braindead-easy way to kill all of the opposing team. As someone who "who's been killed by gjally more than a few times in gambit," you probably are aware there really isn't a whole lot you can do, unless you out play the invader so bad it's embarrassing. In this video specifically, without Gjally or EoT, that team would have banked 99/100 times with the invade coming in when it did.  (Source: I reset my Gambit rank 3x during Arrivals and have done it 5x since.)

Gjally has an issue that I think should be addressed, do I have the answer? Not really, because I'm not a game dev and don't really know how that shit works.
Yes..  Make it a boss burn race. Some people hate/despise pvp and others who love pvp despise Gambit. This is why it's a shit game mode. Not to mention for the time invested it's virtually pointless outside of nerd points.
Yes. It is the single most annoying mechanic in the game mode.
    ????

I love the mechanic itself. Killing the Invader makes me feel actually awesome, because I was able to use my kit to take them down even though they had the advantage. As well, I \*love\* invading, and I always heap praise on my teammates when they get them. When I'm invading, it makes me feel amazing to manage a team-wipe. 

What I hate is heavy weapons. Because it makes invasions pointless to fight against, or makes it pointless to invade if you aren't using the meta (Xeno, for instance). Like I typically get 12-16 kills in Gambit and I've been killed by Chain of Command and Xeno that I've focused on unlocking both just so I can use them
Using khostkov of course
Special ammo and abilities
If only there were two giant bars at the top of the screen that showed exactly the amount of motes both were holding and have deposited??????????

Stop making excuses for small brain players who ignore basic game mechanics
    That literally does nothing for the fact that he basically got an immediate, free shot a second after invading. Just because you can see that the event team *can* invade, doesn‚Äôt mean they will.
Tell me about it.....It makes the campaign so much harder cause I like running around with my Masterworked trinity ghoul,
True, but I know the mode isn't as fine tuned as it could be. I hope they focus on doing a full rework of gambit at some point (I know they did some tweaks and are doing tests now with it currently, but considering they're about to do a rework of iron banner, it would be cool to see them focus on gambit as the next thing to majorly change up with lore next).
Yeah but then people will moan about their heavy being a useless slot
Yeah most likely which is why I think the invader just came across the perfect opportunity. I‚Äôm sure it wasn‚Äôt fun for the opposing team but in a competitive mode that‚Äôs the risk.
You'll only get my praise when you manage to wipe a team with a primary, hell I wouldn't mind if I get clapped by a sniper, at least those require aiming
    Completely agree.  I usually invade with nothing but Night Watch and maybe an empowering rift, still get Army of One. This clip was made to show how broken Gambit is right now. If they're not invading with Gjally, then it's EoT. If not EoT, Truth. If not Truth, some other tracking rocket with 6+ rounds. The heavy economy is way too rich today.
        I also noticed that almost NOBODY uses an LMG while invading...why??
            Clip basically spells it out, precision frame tracking rockets are so free that it‚Äôs silly to use anything but that.
                Silly? Nah that would actually earn you respect if anything, all I see when people use those RPGs are Elmer Glue eaters
Loads of people have it. There was regular lfgs to farm for it. I've done it at least 10 times with people for a laugh.
Me and my clan got that by accident the first week Gambit was introduced. It‚Äôs the only reason I have it lol
    Yeah, back then we made sure everyone in the clan got it ‚Äî and would even message opposing teams for a pact to allow each side to knock it out before invading. 

But that was a long time ago and the majority of Destiny‚Äôs current active player base weren‚Äôt there for the release of the new game mode called ‚ÄúGambit‚Äù ‚Ä¶which is what I mean when I say not a ton of people have it.
Dont mind me I'm just stopping by
Split an atom
Well Hammerhead was first meta when gambit prime first came out so those two weren't going to be in the game yet for a good 6 months
...in the general direction of a target. The bullets on that thing feel like they're the size of Guardians.
    They are‚Ä¶
    It fires handheld hitscan mortars
At least you have to aim with leviathans breath...
Now I'm imagining someone invading while the Primeval is up to block DPS from heavies on it
    that's actually a neat idea, have invaders that try to survive as long as possible to delay dps, basically be the blocker

combine it with a massive decrease in kill healing and it sounds fun
        Cloudstrike would like to know their location
sniper rifle moment
No please don‚Äôt. Why are you all complaining about things that are part of the game ‚Äî why don‚Äôt Bungie just disable Destiny?!?!
    Disabling the game itself temporarily for both the invader and the defending team could be interesting.
        Haha not what I meant but that made me laugh üòÇ
My fav take so far is that it should be disabled for PVP, but still damage in PVE. It'd prioritize the Invader and add a level of fear when you die (since you might lose your heavy), and it'd balance some of the most shit balancing issues.
Summons Crota.... if all 4 bank 30 it forces the other team into the Crota Raid....
    So long as we got the banger music I would be slightly less mad. : p
Damn, I didn't even think about that! I'll definitely consider it for 1350 content. A 65% dmg bonus would be niceee

            This is me in crucible. I had 2 matches where I didn‚Äôt score a single point in freelance IB. It was a terrible experience. I still gave it my all and didn‚Äôt give up because my teammates at least deserve that from me. For the record I think only one or 2 teammates had a point those matches..
Maybe. But that Only draws primeval fights longer since heavy is 99% how you deal Damage to the Boss. Specially with this new gambo system
That‚Äôs my exact point! ;D
An idea could be to just kill stuff quickly and use mobility. Or use things to be protected like the titan flan glaive (pocket WoD). Basically your priority would be to survive and kill, not so much grab motes.
If you have it, try doing the Witherhoard/IKELOS SMG combo with warmind cells. Warmind cells don't have the reach they used to have but they can still kill shit quickly. That and BTDB. Helped me get Thrillmonger quickly.
    Unfortunately I don't have Shadowkeep (or 30th Aniv/WQ) which I probably should. I am aware that Witherhoard would let me easily get Thrillmonger. Currently using Agers+Ikelos SMG. Forgot about Warmind cells though, was wondering why everyone was saying an average SMG was good, your comment made me realise why.
        Ager's works too.
I mean I guess, but there are other weapons that will dominate the enemy team
    Darci meta when?
        Lmao, seriously tho I hope bungie does something with darci, it has a nice theme and a very cool look,and I simple rework of the weapon would do it wonders
            I think it just got power crept to obscurity. I think a modest buff in damage with a touch of precision damage bonus could do wonders for it, maybe add triple tap too. Right now I don't think it performs better than a kinetic legendary, while taking up a heavy exotic slot.
                Actually, with the new airborn accuracy trait bungie will be adding, I feel like there‚Äôs potential here, perhaps darci could have the best in air accuracy in the game, whilst having some other things, like the triple tap you mentioned and maybe the ability to keep your tracker while aiming down the sight
                    Quite frankly they could simply move it to the kinetic slot and it'd probably be fantastic, especially getting that 10% damage bonus there and being a special weapon
                        Ya, but idk it feels like it would brake something idk
If only there were things between you and the opponent that could break the tracking...

Damn those wide open maps with zero cover
    Yeah I totally haven't been killed behind cover, multiple times, via a direct hit, because of the tracking.
        Let me just hide behind this small rock and hope the 7 tracking rockets don't find me... using things like buildings or cover to break tracking just wouldn't be sporting.



Do you have any game sense at all?
            Yeah, a small rock is what I was hiding behind. 

Have you watched ghorn gameplay at all?
                Yeah and it's always people who think every encounter in this game has to be open gun fight with no strategy, just run at the enemy and hope for the best...

Like the crucible.

Exotics aren't gambits biggest problem. It's the morons who fill the playlist trying to bot thier way to a cheap pinnacle.
                    I mean. Even if the Rocket hits your cover instead of you. Wolfpack Rounds go over the cover and hit you anyways. 

Move away? The invader is still in the field, and if that first Rocket didnt kill you the second one on the chamber likely Will.
                        Which would be a problem if the maps were open, which they're not. 

People just don't learn the maps because they don't care about the gamemode, they just want to idgaf thier way to a pinnacle. The amount of these videos complaining about heavy in gambit and its a dude standing in the open or hiding behind the bank. 

There is only 4 maps. Each with 3 fronts and a central bank. Each front has a sightline to the bank but not to the other fronts. An invader can only spawn in a front without enemies. Both teams are guaranteed heavy. He knows where you are but its a 4v1 and even if your team doesn't know where he spawned and splits up it would still be a 2v1 with both sides having heavy. Its not rocket science.
I did, and if you give an example when others are farther away from each other and it tracks better than it should, you will have a better example to show everyone. Otherwise, much to everyone who down voted me, it is still mostly a grouping problem with that clip.
    >it is still mostly a grouping problem with that clip

`Be me`

`Playing Gambit with a couple of the homies`

`See that there is a triumph when we bank 60 at once`

`By god we get 15 each and book it to the bank to get them in before an invade`

`Some scrub with gjally comes in and within 3 seconds of invading mercs all 4 of us before we can bank with 1 rocket`

`"It's mostly a grouping problem." "You shouldn't all group up, especially when you have that many motes." "I can't believe that you'd commit such a grievous oversight." "Your team sucks because you couldn't adjust your tactics when someone invaded." "You really should get gud."`

Personally, I'm not *that* invested, but Gjallarhorn presents a braindead-easy way to kill all of the opposing team. As someone who "who's been killed by gjally more than a few times in gambit," you probably are aware there really isn't a whole lot you can do, unless you out play the invader so bad it's embarrassing. In this video specifically, without Gjally or EoT, that team would have banked 99/100 times with the invade coming in when it did.  (Source: I reset my Gambit rank 3x during Arrivals and have done it 5x since.)

Gjally has an issue that I think should be addressed, do I have the answer? Not really, because I'm not a game dev and don't really know how that shit works.
????

I love the mechanic itself. Killing the Invader makes me feel actually awesome, because I was able to use my kit to take them down even though they had the advantage. As well, I \*love\* invading, and I always heap praise on my teammates when they get them. When I'm invading, it makes me feel amazing to manage a team-wipe. 

What I hate is heavy weapons. Because it makes invasions pointless to fight against, or makes it pointless to invade if you aren't using the meta (Xeno, for instance). Like I typically get 12-16 kills in Gambit and I've been killed by Chain of Command and Xeno that I've focused on unlocking both just so I can use them
That literally does nothing for the fact that he basically got an immediate, free shot a second after invading. Just because you can see that the event team *can* invade, doesn‚Äôt mean they will.
Completely agree.  I usually invade with nothing but Night Watch and maybe an empowering rift, still get Army of One. This clip was made to show how broken Gambit is right now. If they're not invading with Gjally, then it's EoT. If not EoT, Truth. If not Truth, some other tracking rocket with 6+ rounds. The heavy economy is way too rich today.
    I also noticed that almost NOBODY uses an LMG while invading...why??
        Clip basically spells it out, precision frame tracking rockets are so free that it‚Äôs silly to use anything but that.
            Silly? Nah that would actually earn you respect if anything, all I see when people use those RPGs are Elmer Glue eaters
Yeah, back then we made sure everyone in the clan got it ‚Äî and would even message opposing teams for a pact to allow each side to knock it out before invading. 

But that was a long time ago and the majority of Destiny‚Äôs current active player base weren‚Äôt there for the release of the new game mode called ‚ÄúGambit‚Äù ‚Ä¶which is what I mean when I say not a ton of people have it.
They are‚Ä¶
It fires handheld hitscan mortars
that's actually a neat idea, have invaders that try to survive as long as possible to delay dps, basically be the blocker

combine it with a massive decrease in kill healing and it sounds fun
    Cloudstrike would like to know their location
Disabling the game itself temporarily for both the invader and the defending team could be interesting.
    Haha not what I meant but that made me laugh üòÇ
So long as we got the banger music I would be slightly less mad. : p
Do bear in mind that weapons are hard coded to have better damage with a higher power level, even if light advantages are not a thing. It was made like that so the forbidden duo couldn't be as powerful even in content where you could get away with equipping them.
    While you're not wrong, that power advantage caps out at +20 power, so in 1350 content there is no difference between 1370 and 1550. Based on what I'm able to find, that power advantage caps out at [roughly 13%](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sObekOYHkPDKCqAGbZcUfX9LRF0cRU4yn7m0KURY2UY/edit#gid=1575509473). Not nothing, but things like Delirium's 65% boost would still be a net gain.

Also, this whole system predates sunsetting. It is not a product of it, simply the mechanic through which it works.
        Ah. Thank you. : )
I don‚Äôt think it would be well received. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs still in all crucible modes. Even in mayhem a super based mode lol
Up until it spawns the invader with the enemies
I just wish the game would say where the invader is in bound from. I'm not going to take the time to memorize invader spawn points for a mode I view as a chore.
That has nothing to do with someone constantly doming the invader no matter where they are. Even after the invader has moved around, they will get immediately domed over and over.
    that's called skill gap.

Honestly, its not hard to find an invader, they are only hard to counter when they catch you off-guard with their heavy.
         No, it‚Äôs most likely called wall hacks.
            sure mate.
                I can‚Äôt count the number of times I‚Äôve been 360 no scoped no matter where I am on the map. But sure, chalk every single one up to ‚Äúskill.‚Äù Lol
                    "360 no-scoped"

maybe you are letting them hit 360 no scopes with your piss awful invading.

I don't chalk it up to skill issue every time, but the fact that you say you can't count the number of times is just saying that you die a lot and blame it on wall hacks.
No, I mean, they legit like 360 no scope me no matter where I‚Äôm standing. Even if I‚Äôve already moved from the spawn point.
Oh I know. I use that gun a lot in freelance to help my team spot the invader (because blueberries). But a lot of the situations I‚Äôm personally referring to, I took no damage from anything beforehand and purposely went out of the way to pop my head around places where you normally wouldn‚Äôt expect an invader and would still get instantly domed.
    ahhh okay, then definitely wall hacks XD
Oh well yeah, in that case of course :) I just meant banking 4 motes after the first wave, like in the beginning of the game :)
Oooohhhh interesting. As a gambit lover I could hella get behind this.
You could also just disable invading. But both seem key to the game mode for some odd reason.
    Why would you want to disable invading?
        Why would you want to lower the health of the boss?
            So that heavy can be gone? Without it being an issue?
                Seems like heavy is only an issue because of invaders. 

Listen I'm going to speed up this conversation. 

Your likely response, if you are like anyone else I've had this conversation with, is along the lines of "But invading is a core game mechanic for Gambit. It's the only mode that combines PvE and PvP!"

Yup, I don't disagree.

But so is the boss fight. 

I don't think nerfing the boss fight is any more valid than removing the concept of invaders entirely. Heavy is important to the boss fight, but damaging for overall Gambit health during invasions. That's the core balance problem of the entire game mode. Hypothetically if invasions were not a thing, using heavy ammo strategically would still be hugely important. 

I don't think it's a valid tweak to the game to remove heavy ammo entirely.
The game is almost over anyway, just camp the portal and piss them off for the rest of the game.
I‚Äôve come back from being way down with a teammate who would invade and get a couple of kills each time. It was a great feeling of accomplishment winning that.
Im sorry you guys rob yourselves of that experience by quitting.
    sadly for me the grind is more of a chore than reward. Lately ive been feeling forced to grind, say for example gambit just to get the shotgun skin and the seasonal challenge. Id be playing for the grind and not having fun, its a vicious cycle I dont like :(

        Which would be a problem if the maps were open, which they're not. 

People just don't learn the maps because they don't care about the gamemode, they just want to idgaf thier way to a pinnacle. The amount of these videos complaining about heavy in gambit and its a dude standing in the open or hiding behind the bank. 

There is only 4 maps. Each with 3 fronts and a central bank. Each front has a sightline to the bank but not to the other fronts. An invader can only spawn in a front without enemies. Both teams are guaranteed heavy. He knows where you are but its a 4v1 and even if your team doesn't know where he spawned and splits up it would still be a 2v1 with both sides having heavy. Its not rocket science.
I can‚Äôt count the number of times I‚Äôve been 360 no scoped no matter where I am on the map. But sure, chalk every single one up to ‚Äúskill.‚Äù Lol
    "360 no-scoped"

maybe you are letting them hit 360 no scopes with your piss awful invading.

I don't chalk it up to skill issue every time, but the fact that you say you can't count the number of times is just saying that you die a lot and blame it on wall hacks.
Seems like heavy is only an issue because of invaders. 

Listen I'm going to speed up this conversation. 

Your likely response, if you are like anyone else I've had this conversation with, is along the lines of "But invading is a core game mechanic for Gambit. It's the only mode that combines PvE and PvP!"

Yup, I don't disagree.

But so is the boss fight. 

I don't think nerfing the boss fight is any more valid than removing the concept of invaders entirely. Heavy is important to the boss fight, but damaging for overall Gambit health during invasions. That's the core balance problem of the entire game mode. Hypothetically if invasions were not a thing, using heavy ammo strategically would still be hugely important. 

I don't think it's a valid tweak to the game to remove heavy ammo entirely.
Quite frankly they could simply move it to the kinetic slot and it'd probably be fantastic, especially getting that 10% damage bonus there and being a special weapon
    Ya, but idk it feels like it would brake something idk
