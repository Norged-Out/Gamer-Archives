[[The peak of Hoyoverse so far]]


As a Genshin/Star Rail fan playing HI3rd for the first time, I just got to this part. I’m broken 😭


so true bestie

\*punches you in the gut\*
    *Sigh* mom the inter dimensional Lesbians are fighting outside.... again
Most normal lesbian breakup😭☠️
    Pretty sure this is how all lesbian break ups go right? 😭
        It’s true, my aparment building has been destroyed 4 times because of lesbian break ups
        Second
        Can confirm
    You know it's angsty when even people who haven't played honkai quote Mei's lines

I brought Mei-senpai home today finally 🥲
    Nicee, I’m gonna pick her from the selector no question 😭
This is was such a good arc. Mei was always my favorite of the trio and this scene right here, while it didn’t make me hate her, I did catch myself thinking why she had to be so cold. Thinking about it after though, I get it. As much as we see this hurt Kiana, Mei was hurting too. She just doesn’t show it as much. The whole chapter Mei was agonizing over how to save Kiana and if she would be forced to watch her die and probably holding on to her sanity with everything she had. The scene with the curry she makes for Kiana almost got me ngl. 

During this fight, Mei’s heart is breaking. This is probably the hardest thing she has ever had to do and its why she appears so cold and heartless. She is suppressing her emotions here; at least until that last part where she knocks Kiana out and then her expression softens for a moment. She can save Kiana, but she can’t be with her if she does. But her most important person will live and have a chance at a life. Mei just has to give up her place in it. If it weren’t for Elysia existing, Mei would be my favorite character of all.
    Completely agree, absolutely my fave moment in all of Hoyoverse so far 😭 (hence the title). You explained it perfectly, the writing between KiaMei is spectacular at least imo. One of my favourite parts was when the Herrscher of Thunder(?) was speaking to Mei and telling her everything she has to give up in order to achieve the power. Mei agrees to everything without a moment’s hesitation, UNTIL it mentions Kiana. It takes a tiny bit longer for her to respond, but of course she agrees even then. Despite the fact that she cannot ever be by Kiana’s side again. Small details like those are everything to me. God I love this game.
Thunders of Nagazora is pretty cool, yes
LoTF was so sad, Mei wasn't doing it for power or vengeance, she did it because of love
    “If rescuing you is a sin, I’ll gladly become a sinner” 💔💔💔
        🔥📝🔥
 **If saving you is a sin, then I'll gladly become a sinner**
This is one of the best and worst moments in Honkai for me. Playing I knew it would lead up to this, but I remember being surprised at how cold Mei was, and honestly felt really heartbroken and angry at Mei (which is why it is so good). Like why did it have to go down this way?!?! Even though i knew why, but still... why... 

After this point I actually didn't like Mei for a while haha, but now she is my second favorite character In HI3.
    Literally how I felt watching it 😭 I gotta respect her resolve though, she didn’t even need a moment to decide. She went all in right away as soon as she found a way to save Kiana 😩 If that ain’t love idk what is

I’m a biased Raiden fan (thanks to the Shogun) so I don’t think anything Mei does would make me hate her 😭 BUT I was also a bit angry, like wasn’t there any other way?? Did it have to be like this 😭
    She was literally trying to save Kiana
        I know, and she did save Kiana, if Mei didn't become HoT Kiana would have died. Becoming HoT was an inevitability, and thus also their clash. I accept this, but I still don't have to like how it went down. Well now I'm kinda indifferent, but the first time I absolutely didn't like how it went down. I though they could have resolved it in another way, or rather I would have liked them to resolve it another way, but maybe that just wasn't possible.
            She wanted Kiana to see her as a villain, to not care about her anymore, so she wouldn't use her void powers trying to save Mei. Mid fight it became obvious it's not going to work so she snapped and opened up her real feelings.
                I'm aware, and that was what I didn't like. I felt that she could have done it another way.
                    Well she thought Kiana wouldn't understand it other way. Which may be wrong but making wrong decisions is a sign of a good character.

Fr tho peak kiamei.STILL waiting for multiversal kiamei in GI and HSR.
    I’ll get on my knees at hoyo’s door to beg for this 😭
Wow Mei is such a good friend for Kiana
As much as Graduation Trip and Everlasting Flames just emotionally grind me into dust then send the dust off into the wind

There’s just something else about Lament of the Fallen. It just goes so unbelievably hard

https://preview.redd.it/y4fjjg7z7doc1.png?width=2688&format=png&auto=webp&s=66269feb1fcab21fdfb50d2292d459af8f1a28f6

[This](https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/91190770) drawing of Shogun over this^(\^) frame is one of my favorite pieces of art that I’ve ever seen.
    Oh I’m beyond excited for Everlasting Flames 😭 I assume it has something to do with the Herrscher of Flamescion right? I think I saw a clip of Kiana going nuts with a big sword or something. My friend let me play her on his account and she goes so hard 😭 Can’t wait to get to it, but for now Lament of the Fallen is my favourite moment

The drawing goes so hard 😭😭
        Lament is still personally my favorite, but damn. I’ve still never been able to watch Everlasting Flames or listen to the song without crying. I can’t wait for you to get to it.
For me the peak was the story of the Elysian realm but that's just me.
    Is that a part of the main story? Or is it like the story for the Elysian Realm game mode? I’ll probably love this too 😭
        It's unlocked after captain level 50. It's really good.
            Wow I literally just hit 50 haha, will definitely play it
                Youll get to a part in the main story where you will want to stop and play Elysian Realm.I think it was Chapter 25 but could be mistaken, but a character tells you when to do it.
                    Interesting, I think I’ll keep playing the main story till then, Elysia lookin fine as hell 😩
                        Yeah, absolutely do not do Elysian Realm before you get there in the story. [This](https://hoyostans.be/explore/honkai-impact-3rd/consumers-guide-hi3/) guide is really good for knowing when to do what.
        A part of it is in the game mode but there’s also 3 chapters dedicated to it, from 29 to 31 iirc. The order is game mode then story chapter if you’re wondering.
    https://preview.redd.it/v2f44exkwboc1.jpeg?width=2408&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b0c4ab4ff7e09493defdb2c9cf26e837fd834c11

I'm on it , it's this one right???? , and is it necessary to complete Elysian realm mode , i was sped running the story and this is taking more time than I thought...can I skip this ???
        It’s canon and when you do chapter 29-31 you will be confused
            do you mean , if I skip this then I'll get confused or it's complicated either way 😅???
                If you skip you will be confused, ye my wording was bad. ER directly leads into chapters 29-31.
                    what abt chapter 26 , 27 , 28 😅???
                        Elysian Realm happens in parallel with chapters 26-28. If you wanna play really chronologically, play chapters 1 and 2 of ER before chapter 26 and play ER Chapter 3 after doing chapter 28. One bit of UI help, there is also chapter 25-EX stuck in the bottom left corner of the arc tab when you select the chapter 26-28 arc.

                            thanks for telling , i was about to skip the ER part 😅...
                You have to do it yourself. Once you get to the story that follows this part you will be very confused. It's hard at first to really immersere yourself into but trust me it's really good. You can take breaks and go at your own pace too
                    https://preview.redd.it/kiiq8vblzboc1.jpeg?width=2408&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=899c69de2a2c66e283b8ce1144da425fa0145082

does it have cut-scenes or do we get the lore just through these conversations ???
                        There are cutscenes if you follow the chapter missions, but it is mostly convos
                        It has both. I suggest starting it after chalter 25 and finishing before chapter 28
    No absolutely agree. The story became next level with the flamechasers but it started as soon as Fu Hua's background.
If you are broken now, just wait till you can watch Graduation Trip.
Mei is peak!❤️
    Damn right 😈
so glad they got rid of those goody ass shoes on the final HoT design holy hell
This one personally made me utterly hate Mei.. it started here and it never went away, even after everything. Banger animation though (Spoilers:) >!but it never really went anywhere, especially considering the whole “I’ll gladly become a sinner” thing. I thought it was going for the Sasuke leaving route or even Oath Under Snow Shirou Emiya route but nothing not even that. It falls flat. It’s nothing but a good quote.!<

https://preview.redd.it/z1hxryw01coc1.jpeg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=37c9cc8e88d1c0476c0d09cd16a8757351dba438

Spoilers: >!It’s funny because Otto undeniably owned that quote more than Mei, he became THE sinner for Kallen.!<
    Spoilers: >!This was the same for me honestly. At the time I thought “oh wow electric person with dark hair leaves the the village in a violent confrontation” haven’t seen that before. But I was actually excited because a sasuke arc would be really cool. But what ends happening is that the story just coddles Mei into doing no wrong. The WS literally stops doing evil things the moment she joins. The the Ana schariac arc was supposed to address this but she again did nothing wrong or “morally ambiguous”. She stopped the being that would destroy the world. Woopity doo soooo evil. And then we just end up with an edgy ass for years with no bite. Sasuke was cool because he was **actually** an asshole and did fucked up stuff. But Mei just returns like nothing happened and everybody is happy again. And yes, Otto fits the quote universes more than Mei ever did. Even in retrospect, what ever even forced her to be there? Couldn’t she just leave? Would Kevin hunt her down and kill her idk nobody said anything. Join terrorist group just off of promise alone. When Mei became HoT the job was already done. Literally what was the point of all of this. !<
        The idea was the WS end game plan would save Kiana, the world, but kill lots of people. That whatever it is, Kiana would fight against it and try to sacrifice herself to save everyone else.
    wasted opportunity for the edgy mei arc indeed
Top 10 anime break ups/hj
Man some of y’all must really like Naruto
If saving you = sin, then I am sinner
wait until everlasting flames animation
![gif](giphy|WrNfErHio7ZAc)

*Mfw Mei actually thought that SoB Kevin actually had a cure*
I still feel mad about those superhigh heels that we got to see just here, cause i dint remember seeing them anywhere else
    Yeah they changed the model in-game due to complaints I think? Not sure, but I’d love to play with those high heels 😂
The best part of the animation was for me when 


Kiana grabs Mei's leg to break(due to the influence of HOV) Mei gets angry for that and bashes Kiana's head to wake her up

This small exchange can give you all the information about their relationship and both their wants and conditions of the exchange (fight) happening
    Oh hell yah, I loved that part too! The choreography was amazing, and it definitely paints a picture all on its own too. The way she turns her body to avoid the elbow, transferring the momentum into a punch to Kiana’s face was really well done imo
Some of the big payoff moments in Genshin, Star Rail and other HI3rd chapters might be on this level or better but in terms of quality of the arc as a whole, writing, pacing, amount of filler, etc Nagazora is the best HoYo has ever done. And so many great scenes. Several characters showed from new sides. Flashbacks done well, not the usual PowerPoint impact.
    Oh for sure, all of the games have many great peaks (Star Rail still cooking but I have faith in HoYo to pull of Penacony) but damn I will be thinking about Nagazora for a long time 😭😭 so peak
so real
Man, I just picked HoT for that free login event without regret.

Peak Herrscher!
No doubt
Don’t forget the Mei and Sakura team up.
You forgot the quote! The quote!
Nah peak was chapter 21-22
"If rescuing you is a sin, then im gladly become a sinner" thats the hardest quote i ever heard.😭
I'll be honest i genuinely hated to play Mei's story arc but i liked watching it, plus what came after (senti and puppets) made the hell that was playing that arc worth for what had to come
It was peak but it wasn’t *the* peak, Elysian Everlasting blows the rest of Hoyoverse out of the water
I wanted her for so long I got her a year after she released and finally SS1 her full gear she's been my most valuable lightening DPS for so long with my SS2 HoR full geared when I first got to this man I was in tears I'm like damn Mihoyo thanks for the depression
Literally best girl
This is the peak of Mei’s story as far as I’m concerned. Sadly all her subsequent story arcs are lackluster by a long shot in comparison
Too bad they censored lesbian relationship, now they just have a "very good friendship"
back when honkai story was actually good, it starts to go downhill around the ending of otto arc
That cinematics got me playing again after a few years. And get to experience it in game. Bro...

        I struggle in sandals
This was one of my favorite arcs in HI3, I’m so happy that you playing it. So are you enjoying the game?
    Yess I am absolutely loving this game! I will admit though, sometimes I find it tedious to play as the trial characters that the game provides (more specifically the Bronya battlesuits excluding HoR). They are just not that fun for me. Other than that, I’m loving the story, as you can see haha. I pulled 4/4 Sena and she is soooooo fun to play. I want Coralie to complete the team, but I’m going to completely finish part 1 first before I do any of the part 2 story. 

Overall, it’s been really fun and the combat system is so refreshing after playing Genshin for so long lol
        I mean Genshin is fun, but it’s definitely like a hack and slash type of game, but at least some of them have unique gameplay, mechanics, and animation. But I love HI3 combat because it’s more focused on each individual character animations and gameplay, except for most of Bronya’s battlesuits, which they have the same animations
Kiana is so pretty
You still aint reached the best peak in the game, wait till you finish thus spoke apocalypse, best arc in the game by far and the PV is just a rollercoaster where you hate otto but godamn do you root for him in the end
My favorite parts are the song part with the lyrics and flashback at the end as i played GGZ/Honkai gakuen 2 before honkai impact came out
    I never played these 😔 but these moments still hit me like a truck and the flashbacks they show are enough to get me fully invested. I might watch some videos on GGZ/HG2 on youtube to get further context though
        I believe it was one of my first mobile games and I think I first played it on my ipod touch. It was one of my preferred mobile games though being more casual I was getting stuck in the Reborn section and didn't get to see all the story myself.                               

I wish I had played some near the end, but I had low energy and motivation for a while around that time and when I finally gathered enough to pick up my games I attempted to login and found out the global version had shut down :(  .                                    

Interesting note - some of the early weapons in Honkai Impact are directly based on GGZ ones though some HI3 ones also made it to GGZ before global shut down. Ones based on GGZ weapons: Mjolnir, Hyper Railguns, \~Proto Alberich's Bows\~, Fairy Sword Silven, at least one of the sakura swords, Hand of Tyr, Balmung, Oath of Judah, Abyss Flower.
Mihoyo be like:All aboard the pain train!
making lesbians...                                        ps. Da wei i need more lesbians me liek lesbians
We peaked at the Old timer's identity crisis imo
Now wait for Everlasting Flames.
Oh yeah, the lesbian breakup arc. This arc is important just to see the reconciliation arc later on, that scene is peak
THIS GAME DEAD IN 2024
    If HI3rd has 1000 players, I’m one of them. If it has 1, I’m him. If it has none, I’m dead. 😂
There was just one thing I never understood about lament of the fallen. Why did they fight? I get kiana tried to stop Mei from going with World serpent, but she didn't HAD to did she? Once she became HoT Kiana was no longer in danger?
    Well… the way I see it, that’s exactly why they fought, you said it yourself. Kevin even talked with Mei about the fact that Kiana would never let Mei do this, if she could help it. Of course Kiana would stop at nothing to try and stop Mei from joining the Serpent. Because of this, Mei had to put her down. Hell, Kiana was able to partially transform into the HoV. This was the height of her powers at that current moment, she pushed herself to the absolute limit. This fight was inevitable. Honestly, it makes perfect sense to me.
        Yes but the whole argument behind Kevin convincing Mei was to cure Kiana, which once Mei turned into HoT she didn't need anymore due to not having inside her the gem of conquest anymore. Becoming HoT saved Kiana, she really didn't have to go with Kevin. Unless I misunderstood something alongside.
            Joining world serpent was the cindition for helping Mei turn into HoT. If she didn't go, it would be like breaching tje contract, and Kevin had a very thick plot armor, so she knows its not a good idea. Besides, its kinda explained in the flame chasers arc, mei doesnt join world serpent just cause kevin wanted, she knows the only real way of saving kiana is to actually stop the honkai, so she joins WS to learn more about the honkai, and learn how to stop it. Thats why once she learns what she needs (although i never understood what she learned) she is like "ok, see ya kevin, gotta go, lol"
Why did they stop the anime cutscenes!
    They did?!?
        Nope, they kept making them until the finale of part 1, but we will probably see one for the important moments in part 2, they just didnt do them for part 1.5 which was more like a side story/build up for part 2
            Wasn’t “You and me” for Seele’s arc in part 1.5? I haven’t started her chapter yet nor watched it so I’m not sure
                That is a cutscene, its made with the in game models and not the models in the animated shorts, it still looks good but not as good as the animated shorts
                    Oh ok makes sense
                    This is what I meant. They’ll likely use in game models going forward.
            Okay thank god 😭 they are such a treat I always look forward to them
        yup
    They didn’t?
        They did. The sena dance was the perfect opportunity. It’s done.
            What are you even talking about? If you mean animated shorts we got one for literally every single major arc. Also part 2 just started???
                Ok. Prove me wrong 🙂

No need to down vote. My opinion is my opinion. They’ve genshin-ized the game already — I doubt they are going to stop now. We will still have animated cut scenes but I don’t think it’ll be in the same style they were. More like the sena dance scene. Again, if not I’ll be proved wrong!!!
                    Have a good day I’m not doing this
                        There’s nothing to do! They’ve change the style clearly. Still love the game but this sucks.
It still has two more even higher peaks and then it’s all downhill from there
Overrated. Fu hua's arc is peak.
    Key word “so far”, my friend hypes up Fu Hua’s arc all the time I cant wait 🙏
        This arc is not even good though. Much better things in all games than this.
            I disagree, I thought it was really good. To each their own though.
Well shit the irony

Context: I'm reading a fanfic where mei gives up peacefully stopping Kiana from being a hero by doing a ggz

If you know what I mean by a ggz then ya know

                    There are cutscenes if you follow the chapter missions, but it is mostly convos
                    It has both. I suggest starting it after chalter 25 and finishing before chapter 28
No absolutely agree. The story became next level with the flamechasers but it started as soon as Fu Hua's background.
Damn right 😈
Spoilers: >!This was the same for me honestly. At the time I thought “oh wow electric person with dark hair leaves the the village in a violent confrontation” haven’t seen that before. But I was actually excited because a sasuke arc would be really cool. But what ends happening is that the story just coddles Mei into doing no wrong. The WS literally stops doing evil things the moment she joins. The the Ana schariac arc was supposed to address this but she again did nothing wrong or “morally ambiguous”. She stopped the being that would destroy the world. Woopity doo soooo evil. And then we just end up with an edgy ass for years with no bite. Sasuke was cool because he was **actually** an asshole and did fucked up stuff. But Mei just returns like nothing happened and everybody is happy again. And yes, Otto fits the quote universes more than Mei ever did. Even in retrospect, what ever even forced her to be there? Couldn’t she just leave? Would Kevin hunt her down and kill her idk nobody said anything. Join terrorist group just off of promise alone. When Mei became HoT the job was already done. Literally what was the point of all of this. !<
    The idea was the WS end game plan would save Kiana, the world, but kill lots of people. That whatever it is, Kiana would fight against it and try to sacrifice herself to save everyone else.
wasted opportunity for the edgy mei arc indeed
Yeah they changed the model in-game due to complaints I think? Not sure, but I’d love to play with those high heels 😂
Oh hell yah, I loved that part too! The choreography was amazing, and it definitely paints a picture all on its own too. The way she turns her body to avoid the elbow, transferring the momentum into a punch to Kiana’s face was really well done imo
Oh for sure, all of the games have many great peaks (Star Rail still cooking but I have faith in HoYo to pull of Penacony) but damn I will be thinking about Nagazora for a long time 😭😭 so peak

Yess I am absolutely loving this game! I will admit though, sometimes I find it tedious to play as the trial characters that the game provides (more specifically the Bronya battlesuits excluding HoR). They are just not that fun for me. Other than that, I’m loving the story, as you can see haha. I pulled 4/4 Sena and she is soooooo fun to play. I want Coralie to complete the team, but I’m going to completely finish part 1 first before I do any of the part 2 story. 

Overall, it’s been really fun and the combat system is so refreshing after playing Genshin for so long lol
    I mean Genshin is fun, but it’s definitely like a hack and slash type of game, but at least some of them have unique gameplay, mechanics, and animation. But I love HI3 combat because it’s more focused on each individual character animations and gameplay, except for most of Bronya’s battlesuits, which they have the same animations
I never played these 😔 but these moments still hit me like a truck and the flashbacks they show are enough to get me fully invested. I might watch some videos on GGZ/HG2 on youtube to get further context though
    I believe it was one of my first mobile games and I think I first played it on my ipod touch. It was one of my preferred mobile games though being more casual I was getting stuck in the Reborn section and didn't get to see all the story myself.                               

I wish I had played some near the end, but I had low energy and motivation for a while around that time and when I finally gathered enough to pick up my games I attempted to login and found out the global version had shut down :(  .                                    

Interesting note - some of the early weapons in Honkai Impact are directly based on GGZ ones though some HI3 ones also made it to GGZ before global shut down. Ones based on GGZ weapons: Mjolnir, Hyper Railguns, \~Proto Alberich's Bows\~, Fairy Sword Silven, at least one of the sakura swords, Hand of Tyr, Balmung, Oath of Judah, Abyss Flower.
If HI3rd has 1000 players, I’m one of them. If it has 1, I’m him. If it has none, I’m dead. 😂
Well… the way I see it, that’s exactly why they fought, you said it yourself. Kevin even talked with Mei about the fact that Kiana would never let Mei do this, if she could help it. Of course Kiana would stop at nothing to try and stop Mei from joining the Serpent. Because of this, Mei had to put her down. Hell, Kiana was able to partially transform into the HoV. This was the height of her powers at that current moment, she pushed herself to the absolute limit. This fight was inevitable. Honestly, it makes perfect sense to me.
    Yes but the whole argument behind Kevin convincing Mei was to cure Kiana, which once Mei turned into HoT she didn't need anymore due to not having inside her the gem of conquest anymore. Becoming HoT saved Kiana, she really didn't have to go with Kevin. Unless I misunderstood something alongside.
        Joining world serpent was the cindition for helping Mei turn into HoT. If she didn't go, it would be like breaching tje contract, and Kevin had a very thick plot armor, so she knows its not a good idea. Besides, its kinda explained in the flame chasers arc, mei doesnt join world serpent just cause kevin wanted, she knows the only real way of saving kiana is to actually stop the honkai, so she joins WS to learn more about the honkai, and learn how to stop it. Thats why once she learns what she needs (although i never understood what she learned) she is like "ok, see ya kevin, gotta go, lol"
They did?!?
    Nope, they kept making them until the finale of part 1, but we will probably see one for the important moments in part 2, they just didnt do them for part 1.5 which was more like a side story/build up for part 2
        Wasn’t “You and me” for Seele’s arc in part 1.5? I haven’t started her chapter yet nor watched it so I’m not sure
            That is a cutscene, its made with the in game models and not the models in the animated shorts, it still looks good but not as good as the animated shorts
                Oh ok makes sense
                This is what I meant. They’ll likely use in game models going forward.
        Okay thank god 😭 they are such a treat I always look forward to them
    yup
They didn’t?
    They did. The sena dance was the perfect opportunity. It’s done.
        What are you even talking about? If you mean animated shorts we got one for literally every single major arc. Also part 2 just started???
            Ok. Prove me wrong 🙂

No need to down vote. My opinion is my opinion. They’ve genshin-ized the game already — I doubt they are going to stop now. We will still have animated cut scenes but I don’t think it’ll be in the same style they were. More like the sena dance scene. Again, if not I’ll be proved wrong!!!
                Have a good day I’m not doing this
                    There’s nothing to do! They’ve change the style clearly. Still love the game but this sucks.
Key word “so far”, my friend hypes up Fu Hua’s arc all the time I cant wait 🙏
    This arc is not even good though. Much better things in all games than this.
        I disagree, I thought it was really good. To each their own though.
It’s true, my aparment building has been destroyed 4 times because of lesbian break ups
Second
Can confirm
🔥📝🔥
I know, and she did save Kiana, if Mei didn't become HoT Kiana would have died. Becoming HoT was an inevitability, and thus also their clash. I accept this, but I still don't have to like how it went down. Well now I'm kinda indifferent, but the first time I absolutely didn't like how it went down. I though they could have resolved it in another way, or rather I would have liked them to resolve it another way, but maybe that just wasn't possible.
    She wanted Kiana to see her as a villain, to not care about her anymore, so she wouldn't use her void powers trying to save Mei. Mid fight it became obvious it's not going to work so she snapped and opened up her real feelings.
        I'm aware, and that was what I didn't like. I felt that she could have done it another way.
            Well she thought Kiana wouldn't understand it other way. Which may be wrong but making wrong decisions is a sign of a good character.

Lament is still personally my favorite, but damn. I’ve still never been able to watch Everlasting Flames or listen to the song without crying. I can’t wait for you to get to it.
It's unlocked after captain level 50. It's really good.
    Wow I literally just hit 50 haha, will definitely play it
        Youll get to a part in the main story where you will want to stop and play Elysian Realm.I think it was Chapter 25 but could be mistaken, but a character tells you when to do it.
            Interesting, I think I’ll keep playing the main story till then, Elysia lookin fine as hell 😩
                Yeah, absolutely do not do Elysian Realm before you get there in the story. [This](https://hoyostans.be/explore/honkai-impact-3rd/consumers-guide-hi3/) guide is really good for knowing when to do what.
A part of it is in the game mode but there’s also 3 chapters dedicated to it, from 29 to 31 iirc. The order is game mode then story chapter if you’re wondering.
It’s canon and when you do chapter 29-31 you will be confused
    do you mean , if I skip this then I'll get confused or it's complicated either way 😅???
        If you skip you will be confused, ye my wording was bad. ER directly leads into chapters 29-31.
            what abt chapter 26 , 27 , 28 😅???
                Elysian Realm happens in parallel with chapters 26-28. If you wanna play really chronologically, play chapters 1 and 2 of ER before chapter 26 and play ER Chapter 3 after doing chapter 28. One bit of UI help, there is also chapter 25-EX stuck in the bottom left corner of the arc tab when you select the chapter 26-28 arc.

                    thanks for telling , i was about to skip the ER part 😅...
        You have to do it yourself. Once you get to the story that follows this part you will be very confused. It's hard at first to really immersere yourself into but trust me it's really good. You can take breaks and go at your own pace too
