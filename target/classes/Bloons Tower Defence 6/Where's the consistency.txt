[[Where's the consistency]]





Real talk the blue bfb actually looks pretty sick
    Red moab is cursed however.
        The red moab would look good with a less intense red.
            Like a dark red
                yep, agreed
            I like it tho
        Yea so true. Red pufferfish would look good though
            Pufferfish abuse
                I must do it for the sake of vanity
            YE
                Hi fellow goose. Wanna torture some humans with me?
                    üó°
        Yes
        False, the blue bfb is cursed but the red moab is cool
        Yellow bad?
        My eyes...I need some holy water
    Could be a cool skin tho
        I agree
    The shade of blue is really nice
    Absolutely, now I kinda wanna see the ZOMG green as that blue.
        Look at tewitys videos then
    Yellow ddts
        Pink B.A.D's üò≥
            And tyen you got lych
                Black and white bloonarius and lych
    Yes they should add this as a cosmetic
    we need blue bfb now!
Real talk, it's because the original design for MOAB's didn't match anything else, because they were the highest tier in the game they were introduced in. 

Same with BFB's then ZOMG's, and now DDT's and BAD's. 

Series is 14 years old at this point, stuff gets added as time goes on. 

*starts rocking in my old man chair*
    I remember playing the first three on coolmath in 3rd grade every indoor recess.

Am I old now??
        I also remember praying the first 3, but I did so at home.

Also I remember playing og bloons cause the td games were so good and not liking it.
            I remember playing monkeys onna old computer after school once, good days
        In grade 3? I was in grade 6!
    I remember those ceramics, man. Those weird painted on ceramics.
        I remember when the ceramics on the moabs were rainbows.
        *milk udders*
    Except, when BFBs were added, MOABs got their blue colour. There was nothing preventing NK from making MOABs red and BFBs blue back when BFBs were added and MOABs were recoloured in BTD4
    Me: *remembers playing BTD1 when it first came out on Newgrounds*

*turns to dust*
    I still feel they can change
 Well bloon go üî¥üîµüü¢üü°

                        BADs should come earlier than DDTs cus black when popped turns into pink

                                    Ohh
                    Did the mf above you delete his comment because he got one downvote?
                        I didnt downvoted him
        ddt is like lead, where it's not part of the linear bloon colors
            Okay then. What about pinks
                üçã
        Yeah i forgot that one
    So what you're saying is we also need a yellow Bad skin? Cause I'm down.
        Yellow, same health as bfb, 3x as fast.
    Tbf, even if we do add in the DDT, then I‚Äôd say it works with the switch presented. Black Bloons are stronger than green, and purples are stronger than that.
        Yeah forgot that one though
    I see nothing other than blue and red balls
    Political compass
That should be the next skins: rigth order MOAB
    Yellow BAD
        Yellow DDT pink BAD*
            Hey guys I wonder if a ddt is an "alternated" moab
            No. A DDT is nothing but an alternated MOAB.
            No. A DDT is nothing but an alternated MOAB. Game hints even tell you this
                Not only is faster, lead, camo and it's even stronger than a MOAB...So you're completely wrong.
                    It‚Äôs a MOAB with pink lead and camo. Game hints turned on, start round 90.
Added to that they are the same size and with default skins on look very alike apart from color
                        Pink, lead, black and camo. Tacking virtually every property in the game onto a moab definitely makes something its own thing, that's before we consider that it has double a MOAB's hp and its children are different.
                            Yea, a DDT is like a Liger (Tiger Lion crossbreed). It‚Äôs still part MOAB, just like a Liger is still part Tiger.
                                Any blimp is part moab?  I really feel like you're bleeding out your eyes trying to discern a difference when I'm not even sure you know all the properties?
                                    ‚ÄúWhat happens when you CROSS a MOAB with X Y and Z‚Äù NinjaKiwi is actually telling you.
                                    Coconut person is right here I would consider DDT as a crossbred MOAB rather than an evolved one. MOAB class Bloons evolve but the DDT immediately goes down in health but up in speed, pretty much opposite of other moab classes behind it
            No. A DDT is nothing but an alternated MOAB. Game hints even tell you this
Cannot unsee
Perfect and simple to make Skin idea lol, although ZOMG would need the black part greened as well, BAD in Yellow, and then since DDT also come from BAD I guess theyd be green too, or alternatively since theyre odd-one-out types they could be Purple
    Ddt could be lead maybe? Camo lead before camo is stripped away so it would be a oversized lead
        Ah of course, Lead is also a breakaway you're right
Because fuck you
    Imagine if this were the official Ninja Kiwi response
        I'd laugh my ass off xD
Don‚Äôt think about it xD
    It seems like it's one of the simpler skin ideas...
    How‚Äôd you feel about a bloonchipper map that could use a split screen? One side being a big bloonchipper acting as the map, and the other being inside of its funnel. While in the funnel it could have several paths which changes the Bloons placement when it gets thrown out. 

Could also have the bloonchipper itself be a upgradable structure. Like after round X a upgrade is available to make every Bloon in the chipper take X dmg per second. 

I would‚Äôve made a illustration of it, but I‚Äôm no better at drawing now than when I was in kindergarten.
        Neat idea but what does that have to do with this thread at all?
            Nothing. Just looked at Rohan‚Äôs most recent comment.
imagine how much more Sauda would talk about tomatoes if moabs were red
I have a better question, why is the moab mauler yellow while the moab assasin has red details and the moab eliminator has green
    Because it looks more badass upgraded.
Zomg and BFB go way slower than those children do though.
    So the MOAB should be pink, and BADs should be red. Confusing idea.
Somehow the current order just makes sense
More importantly why is it that ddts are black & have black properties, but BADS are purple yet lack purple properties
Literally unplayable
Idk, I think the MOAB had a bit of blue in BTD3 when it was first introduced and NK just rolled with it
this is fucking cursed, yo.
new skin idea??
its a surprise tactic from the bloons. they gotta stay unpredictable to get past the monkes
And why isn't the BAD yellow?
    Yellow DDTs. Unchanged (pink) BADs.
Red moab isn't real. it cant hurt you.

Red moab:
I've been asking this question since the computer lab of 2012
I‚Ä¶ I have never thought of that. Why have I never thought of that?
Wait then the b.a.d. should be yellow
    And I guess baloonarius pink
        Yeah cuz ddt's are leads
    Yellow DDTs. Unchanged (pink) BADs.
        I forgor ddt's üíÄ
i want these to be skins these are sick
Literally unplayable
Am I crazy or was the moab red at one point?
Make the BAD anti-magic too while you are at it
because moabs arent the red, blue or green bloon. They are moabs.
It‚Äôs a 10 years old thing, are you really talking about it now
Also the BAD should be immune to magic and energy
    That make the BAD too OP. It already can't be slowed.
Why isn‚Äôt the BAD yellow???
    Yellow DDTs. Unchanged (pink) BADs.
Your question violates law 13203, third paragraph from the Holy Monke Law Book. The verdict is death by fire.
My brain toasted then i understood this
Oh shit my brain
That is very cursed
Yellow ddt and pink bad
those designs are actually pretty rad
Bruh... wait a minute
Yellow B.A.D.
    Yellow DDTs. Unchanged (pink) BADs.
Red looks more powerful than blue
MOAB-class skin idea: Logic
Dave in accounting ate the consistency
DDT become yellow
BAD become pink
Pink DDT
fair point
Logic says yes
But nostalgia says no
Ninja kiwi is quaking in its boots
But then a bad would be yellow :(
    Yellow DDTs. Unchanged (pink) BADs.
Oh god this looks really cursed
Blimps are different from blimps.  

Simple as that.
What if maybe it's the Bloons that should be switched
Literally unplayable
Hmm
Thanks, I hate this. Take my upvote and leave
Just switch moabs and bfbs placement in rounds! Its that simple
no
Z o m g pretty sus
Lol they should add consistency moab skins like this.
They didn't think ahead
Where's the yellow bad
    Yellow DDTs. Unchanged (pink) BADs.
        THE BAD, IS PURPLE
cause the Moab bfb were accidentally colored diffrent and the zomg was fine
Can we also talk about Dark Dribble Titan? If the yellow bloon  is the fourth bloon, why is the fourth moab in dark color? the BAD is fine, its 50% pinkish
Why aren't DDTs yellow? ü§î
big bloon strong  
monke hate stronk big bloon  
big bloon more stronk
That red MOABü•µü•µü•µü•µü•µ
This is cursed
Im color blind
that would be neat for the trophy store, maybe even a pink or yellow ddt
What about DDT? Camo lead < green < blue < red?
Blue bloon is faster than red bloon. MOAB is faster than BFB so MOAB is blue and BFB is red. Doesn't really work after that and isn't the real reason, but it's just a thought.
Blue bfb is really cool
Took me 10 seconds to realise what's wrong here
What have you done
Maybe this can be a skin swapping moabs and bfbs colors
Super weard
yellow ddt, pink bad
yer rait
MOAB stronger than BFB????
the magic immune bad
Ok Bloons, this NEEDS to happen. Right now.
Why not just get NK to create a skin for the moab and bfb for this? and if DDTS come after ZOMGs then just retexture the DDTS with a Yellow coloring? or just get a mod that changes the colors on them? it works either way right?
exactly.
i saw this in my notifications
That's what I'm saying!
Dudeeeee green zomg looks sick!
The red Moab look weird
Blue bfb hitting hard though. Not red Moab though. But hey I mean a b.a.d is purple and ddt is black (even though it‚Äôs lead basically)
Ok dude
This is the first thing that came to my mind when i started playing btd5
Well why aren't BADs are yellow
    Yellow DDTs. Unchanged (pink) BADs.
working on a mod rn
Honestly, this looks super cool. Maybe it could be a bloon texture pack
yellow bad
    Yellow DDTs. Unchanged (pink) BADs.
Lowkey would like this change quite a bit
Good question
It works perfectly fine but the DDT has to mess it up and the BFBs and MOABs also decide to be evil
To make it better, DDTs must be yellow.
Where did you get that background?
Yhea it should red blue green
The Moab looks scary af imagine seeing that on early game
This is the most cursed thing ever
Never even thought if this. Really makes you wonder why they didn't do this
More like BFB > MOAB > ZOMG
I think it goes in just one Line
Because

They get slower
Because moabs are too cool
YELLOW BAD
    Yellow DDTs. Unchanged (pink) BADs.
next comes pink DDT and black BAD. That's because BAD is stronger but ***DDT = FAST***
yes they do. you are just colorblind
By this logic DDTs would be yellow

BADs would be probably unchanged however
Yellow DDT pink bad
Bloon skin?
Nowhere its bloons lol
I agre
üóøhmm
the consistency went into the backrooms smh
Then lead camos and green bloons would go to purple bloons
Doesn‚Äôt make sense
That means yellow bad and FUCK yellow bad
    Yellow DDTs. Unchanged (pink) BADs.
        Bads are purple you color blind
The red moab actually looks pretty good ngl

Okay then. What about pinks

Hey guys I wonder if a ddt is an "alternated" moab
No. A DDT is nothing but an alternated MOAB.
No. A DDT is nothing but an alternated MOAB. Game hints even tell you this
    Not only is faster, lead, camo and it's even stronger than a MOAB...So you're completely wrong.
        It‚Äôs a MOAB with pink lead and camo. Game hints turned on, start round 90.
Added to that they are the same size and with default skins on look very alike apart from color
            Pink, lead, black and camo. Tacking virtually every property in the game onto a moab definitely makes something its own thing, that's before we consider that it has double a MOAB's hp and its children are different.
                Yea, a DDT is like a Liger (Tiger Lion crossbreed). It‚Äôs still part MOAB, just like a Liger is still part Tiger.
                    Any blimp is part moab?  I really feel like you're bleeding out your eyes trying to discern a difference when I'm not even sure you know all the properties?
                        ‚ÄúWhat happens when you CROSS a MOAB with X Y and Z‚Äù NinjaKiwi is actually telling you.
                        Coconut person is right here I would consider DDT as a crossbred MOAB rather than an evolved one. MOAB class Bloons evolve but the DDT immediately goes down in health but up in speed, pretty much opposite of other moab classes behind it

Nothing. Just looked at Rohan‚Äôs most recent comment.
