This is perfection. The BMC music, wave of shots and the popping sounds.

        This is one of the best ones I've seen yet. Good bot.
i thought snipers would all shoot at the same time as soon as a bloon came in?
    Nah. I always stack snipers. Good defense
    I think they all have different levels of ultra boost so they shoot at slightly different times.
        No thats not it. The snipers projectile is shor based on whether the snipers is the closest sniper to s a balloon that it kills.
            ohhhh huh TIL something. had no idea that distance actually mattered, thank you sm!
    Towers don’t shoot at a balloon if they think another tower will kill it.  Screws you over sometimes...wonder if I can make a challenge using this...
Amazing
Nice
I thought they were bouncing bullets XD
Put them in a circle pattern

Battle of the Somme Circa 1916 Colorized.
game uses this system to not make all snipers shoot into one red bloon. If you place the whole map in them it will make a really big wave
Took me a while to see that they had googly eyes lol
now make it infinite
woah how did you do that?
whoa
Bouncing brain cell
Satisfying
Pov: you are a BAD
Game pause: I am going to ruin this man's entire life
Can we count how many Google eyes were on screen? No? Ok
balloon porn :)
They’re too powerful...
Great Job on this bro!
