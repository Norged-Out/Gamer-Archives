[[do you say ROUND 63 or WAVE 63 or anything else ]]





Rounds when talking the round as a whole, but waves when referring to what's inside the round. So round 63 has 3 waves of grouped ceramics
    EXACTLY
i say round personally
I just say round or the number alone honestly
i say hell
Round cause that’s its correct term
i say wave
I usually say, “Dear lord thats a lot of ceramics”
Too lazy, omit both.

I just say “AAAAAHHHHHHHH FUCK I FORGOT CERAMIC DEFENCE”
    me when the 205 boomerang cant beat 63
Personally, they're the same thing. They're "rounds" but waves are basically the same thing by definition to me. Probably too many firefights on reach
    rounds are the wole thing,

waves are "parts" of the round,

like ROUND 63

but three ceramic WAVES see ?
        Thata fair. I just consider the whole round the wave cuz I have to pop them all anyways 😅
             bomb blitz  dont see ceramic or lead all it sees is BOOM
i say o shit but thats just my opinion.
    63 is a random round its about round or waves

( and round is the right anwser )
I say oh i forgot about group damage wait!!!!
