Just say "only restrict towers for ranked", simple stuff simple stuff
    This. But y'all are making this a bigger problem then it needs to be
        For those of us who can manage without the best towers its not a problem, but I reckon the silent majority struggle to finish even with the best towers.
            Even for a normal player, a max of 20 sniper shouldn't be an issue. They might be more space efficient than farms, but that's it, farms are better 80% of the time. Monkeyoppolis, isn't even that good anymore, and is far from necesary. And permaspike is only use in ranked(which is done by the better half of players), or to clean up missed bloons, wich there are also otter opsions for. This event is infact one of the easier ones over the last couple of months. And if you still can't beat it, I'm sorry, but then this is not yet build for you.
                Agreed 90% except for the hero restrictions too; some people just want to chill and use Ben
                    Forgot about that part. I agree
                        100% now!

                    Stickybomb is also great, fauto isn't realy necesary
                Exactly. Ranked sucks and only less than 1% actually use it. Get rid of it. Ninja Kiwi isn't stupid, their a little more smart and only idiots.
                    just don't play it if you dislike it?
                    That doesn't make any sense, and I play literally every boss game as ranked, I never try to score a good time or something I just don't like powers and enjoy extra rewards
                    why would you not play ranked, its literally free rewards even if you don't try for a good time and it doesn't change the game at all
            Got to tier 3 on my own and kept dying, DDT were getting through but limited towers I know work against that boss. Annoying. Just wanted to try it myself
        >But y'all are making this a bigger problem then it needs to be

It's actually easier without them.
            Sorry, without what?
                Without these "best towers". I really dislike using permaspike and xx5 village. With them banned boss is actually easier to perform.
        I must disagree
            And why is that?
    Or add a new mode even easier than normal that doesn't restrict
        Eh I feel that kinda defeats the point of the boss encounter though. Because the normal difficulty is already pretty easy if you understand what towers are best in the boss setting and elite is already hard enough to the point there's really only a select few strategies that work. Anything easier would make boss clears the equivalent of something like beating a fortified ZOMG.
    Despite being in the "it's still not that hard with restrictions" camp, I'm actually all for this.
I find some of their restrictions to be too absurd (looking at you vortex quiet street), but overall, the restrictions is the reason I'm still excited for a boss event.

A week like for example vortex logs, where you couldn't sell, was really interesting, and it honestly made me interested to try future vortex weeks (especially after how forgettable vortex on lotus island was).
    100% agree. I used Tack Zone / Super Brittle / Ninja Paragon against Lych this week and it was an absolute blast.
        Literally a basic ass strategy
            I normally use tack zone… done xD
This is lifted from v27 patch notes (when they introduced Boss events):

>Difficulty Fair Warning - Bosses are designed to be crazy challenging! If you are new to BTD6, make sure you can win most hard modes and really know how to farm well and maximize tower damage before you take on a Boss. Expect defeat. Nay, revel in it - bathe in anguish then emerge smarter, more capable, and with improved tactics that help you get further each time. If you have built up a stockpile of Powers and Insta Monkeys, feel free to use them - they are not required but they are certainly fair game. And, yes, build those Paragons...

Boss events are not meant to be simple. The restrictions are meant to keep things spicy and tricky each week.. Otherwise, it'll get boring real fast if the map is the only thing that's changing every week..
    "And, yes, build those Paragons..."  


Also NK restricting Paragons every other boss event
        Feels like paragons are the most wasted feature ever, extremely hard to get, pretty much available only for bosses or freeplay..

Someone playing the "normal, main game modes" will never make a para
            Isn't that the point though? I mean, you need expensive towers like the Legend of the Night or True Sun God never to beat the maps on any difficulty; those are more about strategy then raw power. The boss events provide a scenario to use those towers in a situation where they're actually needed.
                Yeah I understand. Bosses were designed with paragons in mind so we have them so expensive and strong for that reason. But imo feels like a waste having so many new towers effectively locked to be used only by veteran players in a very specific game mode.

We could maybe have a nerfed and cheaper to obtain version on "standard" game modes or something
                    >We could maybe have a nerfed and cheaper to obtain version on "standard" game modes or something

Those are the T5 towers
                LOTN in bosses 😂
    as a normal player who really isnt to great and only plays normal bosses; the only thing that actually brought me back to bosses was seeing the restrictions. it made the bosses sound more interesting and; yknow; not the same every week
        Honestly banning Monkeyopolis makes me wanna play the boss bloon more
            banning monkeypolis doesnt sound as bad with the nerf to it recently, but i kinda wonder how itll effect elite, if much at all. i guess ill only really see if theres posts about it or someone like isab makes a video because its a stand out boss event or something
                It's no big deal. I cleared elite earlier today and made a post about it. I had over 2 million leftover/unused for Tier 5.
                    Cracked has so much empty space for farms too. I just filled the map with 024s and had more money than I needed.
                        Yeah. The restricted opolis isn't really felt since we can just spam farms everywhere.
            Eh I mean with the ‘opolis nerfed I don’t think it’s really going to be too much of a reliant upgrade anymore
            Found the Ninja Kiwi employee!
        for real, back when Bloonarius first came out it was literally the same strat every week until they started restricting, it was so boring
    I really liked the no selling event, it was tricky but possible. If you want simplicity go play normal maps
        Yeah, no selling Logs was interesting. They've done a fairly decent job balancing the restrictions. No selling happened on Logs, with insane track length. This week, no monkeyopolis but they removed 50 tower restriction, so we can spam farms everywhere.
            Every event Seems to be restricted enought to be original and tricky but not too restricted to be boring. Every big restriction like paragon ban is balanced with a longer map or some diffrent shit. Since more paragons are coming out without restrictions every boss would just be a "farm like crazy and always go for the best paragons that other people calculated" situation.
        Lmao imagine if there was a least cash or a least tiers boss
            That would be poggers
            Would the leaderboard be have Cash/Tiers used instead of or alonside time? 'Cause that would be interesting
                Time attack boss event. Imagine sending all the boss tiers at once
                    There can only be one boss bloon on the screen at once though so the second you send a second one out, you'd instantly lose
                        Well, no. If there is more than 1 boss at once, you will just see the HP of the first one. The second one will work normally you just wont see his HP. NK could make it so if there are 2 boss bloons or more, the HP bar just scales so the second one can appear
        Ah my first boss, it was fair to add some difficulty considering it was the easiest map in the game
        Not gonna lie, a no farms event would actually be hella fun. The first two tiers of boss are usually doable without any farms, and you could use alternate money methods like sniper and boat farming for the other tiers.

Only problem is people like this would cry this subreddit to death
            > Not gonna lie, a no farms event would actually be hella fun. The first two tiers of boss are usually doable without any farms, and you could use alternate money methods like sniper and boat farming for the other tiers.

Have fun trying to play that shit on any Elite boss on any tier beyond 2. Spamming supply drop = fun?
            Spice islands or lotus island would be hella fun without farms since ppl would boat or snpier farm. I wouldnt ban farms entirely but only leave 204 farms to Buff merchantmen and to have some good early game with marketplaces
                I'm just gonna try bosses without banana farms every week from now on
        My favorite was the one on spice islands since it was made before merchantmen farming was considered viable, and getting a high-tier paragon for anything other than boat was out of the question, which made parts like the t4 elite interesting since you would have to give up your farming for a paragon.
    I agree, but I think the restrictions on farming, a core part of bosses is stupid. No Benjamin and no monkeyopolis? Makes no sense
        Do you see them banning farming completely?? Farming is entirely possible, and is done all the time, without monkeyopolis or ben. Especially since Monkeyopolis has been nerfed to such a low level of hell that it's literally not worth using on the majority of boss runs anymore
            which path is monkeyopolis again?
                bottom path village
                    thank you :)
            I don’t think they’ll ever ban it, but banning any part just makes elite stupidly hard just because you don’t have money. This week banned all banana farms, the literal main part of farming
    The problem with it is I can't even get used to the bosses or learn how to play them because the restrictions are so challenging. It feels like I'm being punished for not being there at the beginning. I can beat all of the normal gamemodes, but the bosses are so much different.

A simple solution would be to have a sort of practice mode where there are no restrictions so that players who don't have much experience with bosses can learn how to do them
        normal boss.
    The bosses, especially on expert, are already really hard unless you're constantly looking up ideal meta strats for each one. Even just changing the maps makes certain strats no longer viable. There's a difference between challenging but doable and just plain impossible unless you're an insanely dedicated player who constantly stays on top of the meta and watches content creators on a regular basis.
        No they’re not. I’m a fairly casual player and don’t really follow the meta but I had absolutely no difficulty whatsoever with bosses before restrictions, that they got very boring and stale very quickly. Restrictions are important for bosses to stay interesting.
    NK said get good
    I feel like its their game and they know whats best for it. If you dislike what they are doing with bosses just dont play them. If you enjoy bosses then you will play them even with restrictions. Like i do.

I see bosses as a test of knowlege on the game. "Ok so you used this last time? Try something else look for a solution". it enables critical thinking and anylizing your arsenal. I am a firm beliver that if you dont enjoy something in a game then its not meant for you.

I say best solution to this is either creating a third "casual" mode to a boss where its just the map and difficulty setting. But you have to understand that those shouldnt have any rewards at all, if you want rewards beat a challenge. The other would be to choose a special boss difficulty on any map you want but the rewards should be same as chimpa for example. You get 900MM for the first time beating then repeats are lest efficient. 

I see nothing wrong with what NK is doing to bosses and it keeps the game fresh. Stop whining that you basically cant get free rewards for doing the same fucking strat each week. There is a reason for these restrictions and its rewards.
        Exactly!
    Dude, just add another fucking mode that doesn't have restrictions. For the life of me I have no idea why people are so against this.

"But it's supposed to be hard." Great, so play with the restrictions if you want. But if people want to be able to play without restrictions, let them. It literally does not affect you at all.
        Ninjakiwi might be against this if it costs too much to make.  We don't know what it will cost them.  But as someone who is pro-restrictions I don't see anything wrong against people playing without restrictions.
    It should be optional so we can have the time to practice on normal before moving up and on to modifiers.
    Ex-fvcking-actly
    It's not that this particular boss event is uniquely challenging or irritating. Banning Monkeyopolis is very much the straw breaking the camel's back, from restricting the amount of towers you can get for Dart Monkey/Boomerang/other paragons to 2 so you can't get the paragon, to deleting selling, I'm just fed up with being unable to play boss events because NK keeps reflexively banning things.
        You're still able to play. You just need to employ different strategies.
        To be fair opolis did get nerfed so I don't think it's much of a big deal that it's banned
        bosses are not for everyone lol..... elite is meant to be for the competitive players and you dont have to play ranked and you are suggested to use powers if you are incapable of beating it.

Btw people complaiend that all they did was use one strat to beat the boss. So they made restrictions to satisfy many people as otherwise they would be bored of doing it.
            I remember a while ago when I basically had over 5 mil left over on elite every week. It’s finally nice to actually see some challenging bosses and switch up strategies
        then practice, if you are fed up of being unable to beat the bosses its because you arent skilled enough to beat them. Im not trying to insult, everyone starts off bad and everyone learns the game to a point where they are good
        Just coz you suck at the game doesn’t mean you gotta cry about it
Unpopular opinion; Tower restrictions are the only thing keeping boss fights fun. without them every map would be almost exactly the same.  Mixing in the occasional "no engineers" or "only 2 dart monkeys( IE no dart paragon)" keeps the game mode fresh and doesn't make the mode significantly harder. If you can't win with opolus being the only restriction, the answer is to get good.
    Yeah hard agree there, I think the point isn't to balance the event but to keep it fresh. If you find this week's restrictions too hard then oh well you can skip it. You'll live.
    Git gud
        🤨
        Lol now I'm confused🤣
    Unpopular opinion indeed. dont restrict my fun for yours. Play ranked, which we propose is where all the restrictions should be. Whenever you play any map, do you always just go meta ninja +alch? Its the best strat and there's no restrictions on it. But i dont go that all the time, i like to mix things up on my own to keep it fresh.
        [deleted]
            This is such an absurd take.

Why should they not be able to play bosses without restrictions if they want to? How does them being able to do that affect you at all?
                [deleted]
                    That's not what you're saying. They're asking to have a version of bosses that they would enjoy, and you're saying "you don't deserve that, if you don't like bosses you should just not play them."

That's a dumb take, period. There's nothing fundamentally wrong with a version of bosses that doesn't have restrictions. Literally, there is absolutely no reason not to have that, and if it *were* added a bunch of people who currently don't play bosses because of the restrictions would have a new mode they'd enjoy.

Stop gatekeeping people's fun.

                            If you don't have a problem with a mode that doesn't have restrictions, don't say "why do you have to enjoy everything in the game? if you don't like bosses don't play them." Say "yeah, it would be cool if there was a mode that didn't have restrictions so people like you could enjoy bosses too."
                                yeah, it would be cool if there was a mode that didn't have restrictions and rewards

Here, do you like it?
        Ninja Alch is not the ”meta” it’s just the easiest strategy bad players can figure out
            "the best strategy most people use" is literally the meta dude

the fact a better strategy that no one uses can exist does not mean the best one that people use isn't meta
                “Meta” is what produces best results, not what most people use
                    no it isn't lmfao

if a strat no one uses but hypothetically produces the best results exists but again, NOT A SINGLE PERSON USES IT EVER that is not the "meta strat"

literally by that logic you could never call anything meta because some hypothetical better thing could be out there that would be the real meta despite no one finding it yet.

this argument has reached my limit for arguing with stupid people on the internet for the day. bye.
                Meta literally stands for most effective tactic available what does that have to do with use rates
                    That is a backronym that has never accurately represented what the majority of people mean when they say "Meta"/"metagame".
        Bosses aren’t for causal players like you
            Feel free to link me evidence showing me Ninjakiwis' statement that bosses are only for the top2% of players like isab. The boss event on non-ranked should be fun for everyone, but it isnt.

                    Thanks for this. So NK just doesn't understand what fun is, "crazy challening" my ass. Nk are fooling themselves if they dont think half the people completing the hard weeks of boss events weren't using a youtube guide.
                        Odyssey is for causal players like you but bosses are meant for pro’s
                            The patch notes said it was "crazy challenging" but it didnt say you had to be pro-level like Isab. And i aint a casual kid.
                                Lmao you don’t need to be Isab to know how to play
                                    Glad we both agree on a point i didnt make.
                                lmao you dont need to be isab level, if you have a decent understanding of how to beat chimps on intermediate to advanced maps you should be about ready to handle bosses
                                    Then why are you arguing with me, and not the person directly above my comment who said, QUOTE for QUOTE "bosses are meant for pros"?
                    > Difficulty Fair Warning - Bosses are designed to be crazy challenging! If you are new to BTD6, make sure you can win most hard modes and really know how to farm well and maximize tower damage before you take on a Boss. 

We do, NK; and then you fucking ban it.
                Literally the patch notes, check out the second-top comment on this post.
                    Answer me this then: if bosses are only for "pros"  why is there even a difference between ranked and unranked? After all, pros dont need to use powers or insta-monkeys!
                        Because they appeal to two different types of players? Ranked is for speedrunners. Not all pros are speedrunners. Also, MONKE FARMER
                            Lmao you said nothing. Speedrunning has nothing to do with the mode's difficulty. For thd targeted demographic of the boss event, pros or people who like crazy challenges, ranked and unranked have 0 differences.
                                These are not “crazy challenges”. Even if you’re just decently ok at the game you should be able to beat most boss weeks.
                                    I am just quoting the patch notes that were provided to me my guy. Bring that up to Ninjakiwi.
                                Dude. Are you seriously saying Speed running has ZERO differences compared to the normal boss? 

If that's the case then why are races hard? And why are races in contested territory?
                                    ...Are you being stupid on purpose?
I said that you said "nothing" because speedrunning had nothing to do with the differences between ranked and unranked, the differences, the ONLY difference that has an impact on gameplay is that ranked bans powers and instad, while unranked doesnt.
But hey- thats a good effective technique for arguing you've got there i'll give you credit. Steet away the conversation from what we're talking about to deflect the fact you dont have much to say.
        The only problem with this is cost to Ninjakiwi.  If it costs Ninjakiwi too much to make a no restrictions mode then they won't do it.  But if this isn't going to be a problem then I don't see a problem with what you're suggesting.
        Get better at the game
        well i see your point but the bosses are meant to be a challenge for more experienced players, and there would be no feeling of fun or reward if bosses could be beaten the same exact way every week. having to figure out a strategy that works even with the restrictions in place is part of the fun of boss events. And yes changing up your strategy on your own is nice but in something as challenging as boss events, people wouldn't want to try something new because why would they? If something works reliably every time, why would they put in the effort to try something else?

thank you for coming to my ted talk
    Or, maybe you can do that yourself? If you have a problem with the mode not being fresh, make it fresh yourself and not use those towers, let other people have fun and challenge yourself.
        That's not how that works. That's like saying exploitfix mods in Bethesda games are purposeless cuz you can just "not do the exploit."

NK doesn't want you doing a certain thing for a certain run; get over yourself and just don't do the thing at all if you don't like it.
            >  you can just "not do the exploit."

but you literally can just not do the exploit, or you can be fine with doing the exploits and do them but then you wouldn't be someone getting a mod to fix them in the first place. it's not like anyone is forcing you to do these exploits or even a leaderboard that you need to compete on "force" you to use them.
                Why do the mods exist, and get downloaded highly, if you can just "not do it"?

Think for a bit outside of common sense, which you clearly do have and are arguing on behalf of. Somehow I made that sound like an insult.
                    > Think for a bit outside of common sense, which you clearly do have and are arguing on behalf of. Somehow I made that sound like an insult.

unsure if this was sarcasm or not, but i'm going to assume it's not. i'd imagine it gets downloaded because people follow a thought process of "well if it's there i'm going to do it because it's the best way to do it, but if i download a mod to fix it then i won't be tempted by it anymore"
                        Temptation, spot on yeah. Temptation gets many many people! It gets me too. Being forced out of temptation is a very cool thing in the end, because I like to struggle but my natural thought process while struggling is "ok how can I not"
        "Every game mode should give infinite lives, if you want a challenge just put in a no lives lost rule for yourself."
It's a good thing tbh, otherwise we would always use the same strategy over and over
    This is what I'm saying! Lol kid just wants it easy all the time.
        I bet some people would ALWAYS spam the same towers during the same rounds and call themselves good  


And to be fair it's not even fun to use the same strategy always, at least like this you can also see what other towers are good for this mode
            Yea like druid farming 👍
        Try not to listen to this insect too much. A fruit fly's buzz is much more discernible than a bumble bee's.
            Calm down master oogway 

I'd bet that without restrictions, even unranked normal would lose most of its players after a month

            🤓
            Skill issue?
    The solution to this is to nerf the overused towers or buff the underused ones, not disallow them entirely.
        nerfing or buffing stuff purely based off of how they do in certain mods like bosses or races seems like a slippery slope

some stuff is obviously fine if it realistically would never effect the other modes but otherwise i feel like that could lead to issues

plus, there will always be meta towers that are better than others, itd probably be impossible to make everything equally as good, especially in situations like bosses
            Indeed  
Couldn't have said it better myself  
Heck immagine if they nerfed paragons just because they do good against bosses, when in reality some towers like Ninjas do better as separate tier 5's
            why would you name the fallacy you're making in your argument?

the slippery slope is literally one of the most famous fallacies come on guys
        its not done out of a balance decision, its just to spice things up for that one event, and to make each event feel more distinct from eachother
    Tower Defense games **are** about finding the dominant strategy, though. Find the towers that are most effective, then use them liberally.
        [deleted]
            Me when I can’t just put down dart paragon on r80 and afk on normal 😭😭😭
        If you use the same strategy every time it becomes boring
            Yeah gee, I wonder why the videos that reach people outside of a games yt ecosystem always seem to be the "I'm gonna play X but with self imposed restriction Y" ones, it's almost as if they do better.
                It's almost as if banning yourself from using the meta makes it a challenge and thus entertaining.

        Me after bbing every single maps in btd6 with 0-3-2 snipers plus Geraldo 😴😴
That's practically the same as saying "stop putting Rules in odysseys". Or races. Or challenges.
    It's not though. For challenges and odysseys the rules are basically the whole mode. Without them you're just playing normal games on random maps. And for races the point is to compete.

None of that applies to boss events. Having an easy mode that's just the normal mode boss with no restrictions doesn't hurt anything.
    This did give me an idea.
BTD6 players when they can't use the same OP strat all the time:
    People don't seem to understand that any game **is** about using the dominant strategy, and the challenge comes from finding it. You wouldn't use Total Transformation or Plasma Monkey Fan Club, because that's not effective. Changing the dominant strategy, limiting towers, is **moving the goal post,** it's bad design.
        Just find another strat. Use another farming strat, or something
            Yeah he says that like it's the ONLY good strat. It's also a heavier micro start - this is a great one for idle since you can squeeze 5 boats and a ton of bottom path farms since there's no monkeyopolis. Then just ninja paragon and win. Only hard part is going for a faster score on ranked
        How is forcing players to adapt to the circumstances and finding a new strategy bad design? This is no different than using a different tower combination to beat an Expert map compared to an Easy map. 

Edit: By your definition, games that have frequent balance updates are bad games because they constantly force the playerbase to find a new meta.
            > games that have frequent balance updates are bad games

These are actually bad. If “balance” updates are done mostly to “shake the meta”, that game has no balance, and its devs aren't even trying to reach one
        Only using the dominant strategy in this game is boring as hell.
        its not moving the goal post, its testing your game knowledge, you say yourself the challenge comes from finding the best strategy, so wouldn't limiting certain towers each event actually spark that challenge? since then you gotta try to find what is your best option on the fly instead of just "well this always works so keep doing it every event"
        “Yeah man I just wanna play the same 4 towers every game and never get bored of doing the exact same thing”
        you're right, that's why the game is balanced to create a diverse set of situational options that require adapting to different conditions within the base game. if its such a big part of the game, then it wouldn't be very fun or challenging if you just ~~copied~~ found the single best strategy and never bothered again. they're not balanced with regards bosses or races, which is why they remove problematic towers to maintain a large pool of viable and competitive options to choose from.

if you can't win without monkeyopolis, then iunno; maybe you should work on finding the most optimal strategy with the options you're given or something like that.
        So the Challenge is going to YouTube to see what the best strategy is?
            No - the challenge is to figure out what is the best strategy given the restrictions.
        ***IS*** there even a dominant strategy?
            Yes there's a meta dominant strategy for beating bosses and there are some people who seem to dislike any restrictions that disrupt that.
        No its putting obstacles in the way, your strat usually only needs to be adapted and not completely altered, but you have several days to figure it out and thats the fun of it, especially if you have a friend to think things over with
This is going to be a really hot take but the idea of a boss bloon is for there to be a “boss” bloon, a bloon that is a lot harder than something you would see in regular play. Having restrictions that remove obvious cheese towers keeps the difficulty in check (much like in races).

Nk also added normal and elite for reason so I wouldn’t expect the average player to beat elite mode because it’s there as an extra challenge.

I’ve seen a lot of people complain about “how elite mode is too hard for the casual player” but that kind of makes no sense to me because elite boss is supposed to be a hard challenge for top players.


If elite mode was made easier and restrictions were removed it would make the boss bloon no longer a boss and extremely boring for anyone who wants a challenge and if you don’t want a challenge then just play normal mode.
    "A bloon that is a lot harder than something you would see in regular play"

Honestly now I kinda want freeplay to have boss bloons every 20 rounds starting at round 220
        The problem then would just be the lag
            Round 200+ is already unbearably laggy as is, might as well get some new frames to look at
    Nobody is complaining about restrictions in Elite mode, or even Ranked mode. They’re meant to be challenges for the best / most well-equipped players and everyone is fine with that.

Normal mode should be a bit more accessible to let normal people get a chance to enjoy bosses. If you don’t do them, a huge part of the game is cut off from you.
        to those saying "normal mode is easy you can use anything and still win."

I tried normal mode on a boss event with no restrictions, tried using my own strategy...

I didn't even get to tier 1
            Yeah, it‘s just people who base their entire life around the game and have lost all connection with reality and with how 99% of players play.
            I mean, you can pretty easily use your own strat as long as you recognise what’s important.

If you just put random things everywhere or try to play it like a normal game, you’re bound to lose, but barring elite, boss bloons are genuinely fine if you approach them properly.
            get good then lmao i seriously dont know what to tell you if you cannot beat tier 1 normal without meta abusing
        Normal mode is already very easy(that’s the point of it) all of the complaints I have seen so far was that elite mode is hard because it has restrictions.
        Normal mode is incredibly easy. I don’t think there has ever been a boss that was difficult on normal mode other than that week with Vortex on chutes.
            😂
        Normal mode is incredibly trivial already. you can use just about any strategy and win easily in normal mode.
            Sure, Jan.
Yall complain so much. These restrictions just make bosses more fun and challenging. If it's too hard for you, either get better at the game or stop playing bosses.
By this logic, no tower should ever be nerfed in any circumstance because “it’s not about adapting, it’s about using the same strategy over and over again!”

I kinda agree with those saying that those restrictions are what makes each event a bit more in interesting. And I don't play ranked.

The reasoning "you can make up restrictions yourself" is the same as saying "remove daily challenges or odysseys since there is no point in them because you can make your own challenges in a normal game anyway". The sad reality is that players are lazy and greedy. They will abuse the most powerful strategies and they will rather lose interest and stop playing than "making up their own fun" if you don't force their hand.

Maybe a good compromise would be ease the restrictions or straight up remove them for "normal" boss and leave them only for elite version? If the issue is that it's too hard, than just use powers and instas. You are encouraged to by the game after all. If that's "cheating" but it's still too hard, then I'm confused. It sounds to me that you would rather like playing a normal game more. You don't have to play bosses... And they are designed to be a challenge. Asking for a challenge to be easy seems a bit contradictory, imho. But I can agree with asking for a more scaling difficulty.
Its really not that serious
    It is. Bosses are not playable until they take the shackles off of players. And demeaning someone's hobby, saying it's less serious or important than other things, is something I'm familiar with, and it's never welcome.
        Bruh if you dont like this boss than just skip it and go for a walk or something
            You have done nothing but prove my point.
                Someone sounds like they don’t get pleasured
                No. no they didnt.
                Whatever you say
        Get good at the game. They’re supposed to be hard. Go play logs easy a few times if you wanna use your dominant strategy all the time.
            I think just because their intended to be hard does not mean there shouldn't be a "easy" mode that allows almost anyone to accomplish it

It does not harm anyone in anyone by having a easier mode
        You are Literally unskilled 👍🏻
        Wah wah wahhhh
    "It's not that serious."

Tell me you're a sweat that puts 168 hours a week into BTD6 without telling me you're a sweat that puts 168 hours a week into BTD6.
        Im not at all, its just not the end of the world. Watch a guide or dont participate if you dont want to. Nobody is forcing you to play it.
            The problem is that people can't do it without a guide, even it normal mode sometimes, despite wanting to play it. There's no fun in doing it but following someone else's instructions for a lot of people.
                Then learn some strategies or something its no different than chimps on hard maps.
                    Bro really just said get good 💀
                        -They allowed all 5 paragons without restriction

-There's enough room for 5 boats easily which can get a semi decent boat farm.

-You can use Geraldo for a little extra cash and utility powers lych can't steal.  
Not to mention 20 snipers you can combo with Geraldo's ability potion for great farming late game on top of the other stuff. 


Pick any paragon or make a VSTG. The restrictions on this one are so light and you get a ton of map space. I played this one like garbage and still beat it with a score under 15 minutes on ranked. 

The hardest part is knowing placements and order, but if that's giving you trouble, you probably do need a guide until you get the hang of it.
                            The point isn't that I can't beat it, or that this one is particularly hard, it's the repeated general restrictions.
                    ok I get what you're trying to say but you chose a bad comparison, playing C.H.I.M.P.S in general is completely different than playing a boss event in many ways.
                [deleted]
                    The problem is that it's just not fun for most. I can beat it, but that doesn't mean it's fun, because of the restrictions. The problem is worse for those who can't beat it.
                        [deleted]
                            Have you read the post you're commenting under? This is far from the only post like it. Also, your way of playing strategy games doesn't apply to everyone. Some like to stick with what they know and like, rather than use things they don't know.

                                    I can just as easily say your opinion is shitpost tier garbage. The elite bosses are meant to be challenging, but the normal ones are supposed to be accessible to everyone, which isn't the case with a lot of the restrictions. As has already been suggested, the restrictions should be in ranked mode only, meaning casual players don't suffer from the optimisations of tryhards.
                Who tf can’t even beat normal with a guide 💀
        Wouldnt a sweat tell you that is that serious......
Sounds like someone lost a boss event because they don’t know how to adapt.

You could really easily make it something like 

Normal - No restrictions

Elite - restrictions

Or for ranked how many have said. I agree restrictions can be more fun but since bosses are weekly, restrictions aren't fun if you just want to have a go at a boss for fun on a new map.
I honestly like the tower restrictions for variety, but I also def recognize people’s frustrations with not wanting to play with restrictions. Maybe make ranked matches restricted and normal matches free? I don’t know lol
Nah bro you're wrong. Bosses are made for experienced people, not beginner-intermediate.  
If you don't know how to farm without benjamin or limited towers, then you shouldn't fight the boss. It's that simple
Cope
    Try not to listen to this insect. A fruit fly only sounds like a bee as intimidation, it can't hurt you.
        But downvotes can
        Oh yes what a great example (makes no sense btw)
believe it or not this is actually one of the easier maps for lych. haven't done elite yet but on normal I was able to get all the paragons ....and remade the Nina one and I almost had enough for a vtsg.
Yes, it would be fun if we had bosses in, say, challenge editor or sandbox, as it would let us practice and have fun with bosses. Bosses are difficult by design, they're bosses, that's the whole point, so there will be metas based around the best ways to defeat a boss.

But the point of a tower defense game is finding the meta for a particular challenge, however. Restrictions are a way to alter a challenge as to not have basically the same thing every week with the exception of map (which are usually pretty easy) and the boss gimmick (a fuckton of health and bloon spawns, heals at your expense and becomes immune for a bit, speeds up bloons and stuns towers and other with upcoming bosses).

Using the exact same strategy and towers on *every single fucking boss event* just sounds like such a boring fucking way to play. Never being forced to adapt your strategy so you just never do? Never having to think even a little bit outside the box? Why are you mad that there are sometimes restrictions on bosses because otherwise every single week would be fucking identical and there would be no challenge except 'Plop down the same towers I did last time'?

IF YOU DON'T LIKE BOSSES, THEN DON'T PLAY THE BOSSES.
I smell skill issue
    Sorry my bad
bosses are meatn to be hard... back in the day when bloonarius came out people complained about the lack of restrictions because it is boring and not fun to do bosses. Bosses are meant to be hard as seen by another commenter and its not for everyone of course.. just like expert chimps is not for everyone so are elite bosses. Find strategies that can work due to the restrictions. Restrictions allow creativity to find new solutions to a problem such as "monkey farms are limitied, well im going to use smth else" "dart paragon is banned, well i guess i got to find smth for tier 3"
Honestly, it's only aids when it's bullshit like:  Vortex on Splitway and then restrictions. Actually, the Vortex is usually the only bass that has genuinely un-fun mechanics when on a horrible map with restrictions.
The rules should only apply to ranked tbh
I think restricting certain heroes, monkeys, and upgrades makes the bosses more unique but at the cost of making the event too challenging for normies. They should also be reducing the boss’s health to compensate for restrictions to make the mode more engaging and fun!
if there were no restrictions boss events would become boring really quickly
Genuinely cannot tell if this image is one big shitpost, this boss event is one of the tamest I've seen in a while. You got plenty of space for farms and the negated upgrades can easily be compensated with the other available upgrades you usually use taking down the boss.
I like the restrictions, they make the game challenging and fun
Only make tower restrictions for elite and ranked. It’s THAT easy.
I wish there was at least the option to play bosses without restrictions like this. Even if there’s no rewards or anything, it would be fun to just be able to play bosses more casually and have fun with them without trying to be overly competitive.
I’m someone who is like in between casual and taking the game seriously. Like I do chimps and understand some strategy but I’ve never beaten Lych. I can beat Bloonarius and Elite Bloonarius and I can beat the normal level of the hurricane guy. Can someone explain how to beat Lych? Feels impossible without Paragons.
    Avoid using buffs, and paragons are always good but if you really wanna avoid using then spamming cost effective tier 5s should be enough for normal
        It felt like no matter how much damage I did or how quickly I kill the husk it restores it’s health too fast
            Read up a bit on how lych works, when i say dont use buffs I mean active buffs (aka charge buffs) because lych is able to sap them (basically storing its hp and stunning the towers who had buffs) so avoid using towers like alchemist, call to arms, homeland defense, perma charge, overclock etc, villages are fine outside of x4x and x5x
                Ah okay, I’ll do that then. Thank you for the help!
it's for variety
![gif](giphy|HfFccPJv7a9k4)
Sounds like someone always uses the same strategy for events, dude, come on now, they do so to keep things entertaining and different, bosses would feel too samey if it just changed maps each time, this way it lets you try out towers you'd normally skip, a different strategy, something new, "oh wow i can't spam spikestorm" then find something else, adapt or lose.  
furthermore this isn't about balance as you seem to be implying, if they really thought the towers were unbalanced, why wouldn't they be nerfed directly? and why are they brought back in other events? cause it isn't about them cheesing bosses, its about making people use other strategies, to actually use their brains to beat the boss instead of carbon copying a strategy over and over again, to give them a challenge.
Skill issue
NO ninja kiwi thats a BAD ninja kiwi!
This one is pretty easy. Just spam farms
r/btd6 trying to go 2 seconds without a shitstorm post
I've said this before, BOSS DIFICULTIES.

Easy modes have much less restrictions and a much easier boss, so it's best for people who haven't played much bosses before

Harder modes have strict restrictions a harder boss, maybe even harder then ranked

No more boss hell
Here's my idea: an "easy mode" with no restrictions but fewer, if any, rewards.
    That wouldn’t be a “boss”.
        Hey, uh what about you shut up it’s easy mode stop complaining
        You rather lesser skilled players just not be able to enjoy this part of the game?
Just have it be unrestricted for regular and 2tc half cash no t5s ABR for ranked
I stopped too. I used to do every boss but they're impossible for me now
    They are not that much harder, just coz you can’t drop a dart paragon on round 80 and afk farm doesn’t mean it’s impossible
Skill issue
it would be very boring if the only thing that changed was the map
Sounds like a Skill Issue
Disagreed
Is this a serious post? Lmfao
sounds like a personal problem
i just wish i could play the bosses more at my own pace
As much as I think the limitations are nessecary I just wish there was a casual version where I can do what ever but have bosses with like half the reward or something since me and my buddies want to co-op bosses but we suck lmfao
Seems like a skill issue I mean last week I learned that ninja paragon broken AF against the bosses and this week isn’t that bad I beat normal first try and only had 1 skull left on elite first try
And I’m not even the best player I would say I’m pretty decent way better than embrittlement hater but that not a hard mile stone to pass
Or, ya know, they are trying to create a challenge for players. What would be the point in releasing new bosses, if they didn't make it challenging for people?
Since you are playing *their game*, then also you should play by *their rules*.  


I don't necessarily understand the issue with adding restrictions. It changes the playing field. The event is still clearable. 

Boss events are by design not meant to easy regardless if it's ranked or not. It is meant to be a somewhat of a challenge for those people are capable of clearing advanced and expert maps without any handholding, but even then it's not that hard.   


This is an issue that plagues a lot of games. People think that they are entitled to be able to play and clear every game regardless of their skill and effort. If you want to play and beat said game, put in the effort and time and actually *git gud*.

If games try to be inclusive of everyone, it just hurts for its longevity.
Skill issue 🤷‍♂️
Its a boss, its not meant to be a easy gamemode that you can copypaste the same strat into week after week. Its supposed to be a challenge, if the rules are too hard for you then you need to practice more
If NK doesn't put me any restrictions, I would not play boss events, just boring win the same way over and over
Cope
Ngl this comes off SUPER whiney. Like don't get me wrong, Restriction weeks are a little bit annoying, especially if they nerf meta strats like Sticky Ninja. 
But at that point I either adapt, or just wait till the next Boss Event. Like you're not obligated to play the boss, the only thing you really NEED from them are trophies for the store.
its not a problem its fun
Skill issue.
no one else sees this as satire?? r/okbloonyretard
    but it does seem like OP is being genuine in the comments
I usually spend $1000 monkey money and use a couple I insta towers to beat the new bosses. New players basically can’t participate and if they do the team is way weaker because of them. This makes it so high ranked players will stop playing with new players.
    If you need to spend money to beat it instead of looking up a guide you deserve to spend ur money
gladly i have lots of instas from totem event
so mad
I didn't even notice the tower restrictions today, were there any? I beat normal lych pretty easily
r/ihadastroke
They are suposed to be hard, dont think its as easy as logs chimps. If it wasnt for rules and restrictions it whould be the same thing over and over again
if each boss was just a different map it would get boring after 1-2 plays of boss, adding restrictions makes people need to think outside of the box to complete the boss, also after the monkeyoppolus nerf the restrictions don’t make a big difference
Restrictions are fine, bosses are meant to be for the hard-core and elite players, when they introduced bosses they even said that.  Restrictions keeps the mode interesting otherwise it's just a bland and boring repeating X strategy every game, and that's fun for nobody.
Keep in mind that this is the same guy who says that he will never use an ability. Just ignore this idiot.
So if NK does not change anything then bosses will become boring. If NK adds difficulty the boss becomes too difficult. Is that what I am seeing?
I’m sorry but if you are complaining on a week where only Opolis is banned then you genuinely just have skill issue.
Nah, they get stale if it’s like that. Just make it only for ranked/no restrictions on hard maps
dawg the only restrictions are no monkeyop and basically no spactory, calm down and stop crying over spermaspike
There is crazy good players that hand out their strategies for free if you can spend a bit of time
It’s supposed to make it harder,
I mean I beat it without that stuff no problem
Calm the fuck down. The strategy is literally just farm spam at this point and after monkeyopolis nerf It isn't really useful. Unless you are literally trying to go for record time, You don't really need the spactory upgrades either
Sneed harder
I paid for all the towers, I’m using all the towers
BAD POST! BAD! NO! STOP!
Ya there should be some easier mod for the bosses

Every aspect of the game should be able to be completed by Morjority of player, have an additional mode that makes it really hard for more skilled players
Just use a few cash drops / insta's and it shouldn't be an issue. Defeated tier 5 elite with >50% of the track left

I am so bad at this game i haven't even played bosses but this makes not even want to try, i will get destroyed anyway 😭 Like i have hardly beaten a few expert maps in chimps, this is so hard
The opolis would have been too broken on this map. If you don’t like challenge, don’t play.
Learn to play the game before you play boss events if you aren't able to beat a boss just become better and not yell at NK they did a great job with restricting things so become a ranked player not a normal one if you have a problem
I agree
Well if bosses involved only using the same towers each time then they would get boring. Restrictions make it so people have to be more flexible with their strategies instead of farming straight for all paragons and a VTSG. Admittedly it is hard for less skilled players to adapt but the restrictions are there not just to force you to try other towers but also make each boss event different in its own way which keeps them interesting every time NK tries a new combination. If you can't do the boss events then practicing is the solution, not removing restrictions altogether. The devs did say that bosses were gonna be difficult, the restrictions exist for a reason.
Why hide the 1 extra starting cash man you can like get a farm by popping one less layer

Cringe !
This image is making eyes bleed, but I also don't disagree with the point it's trying to make.
This is exactly why I don't even bother with boss balloons. I know I'm not the most strategic player but bosses as re getting to the point where it's so difficult fighting I nearly lose the first time fighting the boss.
I feel bad for NK having to deal with people complaining about the game in the worst way possible. That’s all this sub has been ever since the engineer paragon released. There are so many better ways to voice your opinion rather than making a post treating the developers like dogs.
It’s the same strat every single time without bans. That’s why we get so many restrictions on CT tiles so each one is challenging and unique
Not like the opolis banning is important- I beaten every boss without it sense the nerf.   
its not really worth it anymore to get.
If it is to hard get good chimps is restricted with powers bosses restect the ovine counter
True
that’s why i think bosses every week should have a type they’re strong and weak to. For example, being strong against magic but weak against primary. Therefore, Nk doesn’t have to restrict all the good towers.(notice how i said all of bc there should still be some restrictions to add difficulty)
Wait, if Opolis is banned, why are people that mad about it when it got crazy nerfed? Last I checked Marketplaces into BRFs is still crazy effective.
We NEED Ranked to have different rules than unranked NK. That way you can balance it for ranked but keep the casual non ranked boss players happy.

Restrictions do keep boss events fresh and such  but mass farming and Paragons need to be allowed in some form as well as some open space to use any strat you like, but yeah there needs to be some difficulty improvements. Splitting the rules between normal and ranked would actually be a win-win for NK and us players, it’s easier for NK to balance and if done properly, it makes us all happy.
My gf and I did the elite non-ranked, she hosted and got no powers, while I did, some bs is going on with that
This week is fine
Honestly at this point they might as well just delete Benjamin.
at some point we'll have to do monkeyless elite
The stock image lmao
Make normal boss have no restrictions, have elite boss have the dumb restrictions, or make ranked have the restrictions only.
Tbh I hate the restrictions but it’s not my game it’s NK’s game. I just want to go into a normal boss mode not in ranked and play how I want. Some times I’m at work and wanna play and set down OP stuff and check back in 5 min. Sometimes I try and use only teir 3 stuff. I really wish I could play how I wanted and could opt in/out of restrictions if I’m playing an unranked single player game that I paid for. I get restrictions add fun I get that but it’s single player unranked lemme use a Vtsg and a boat paragon by round 18 and win
bad ninga kiwiiii bad
I want to fight bosses casually like any other round. The restrictions for weekly challenges wouldn’t bother me as much if so
Wait is this optional? I've never tried bosses before. Or is it always gonna be like that?
no
Bosses are meant to be hard though? It's called a boss for a reason. And you don't have to play them.
I actually like the restrictions of the boss events (most of the time). While some are absurd (bloonarius on basalt mines and vortex on spillway)
They keep the game engaging and fun to play. There weren’t even any restrictions that were too bad this time
Or make a baby mode at this point
Well sometimes the restrictions were a bit annoying like the 50 tower limit or the farm limit, but honestly the restrictions were fun, I spent time planning out the perfect layout for a 12 farm opolis to discover that opolis was banned =))))
Don't listen to them NK. Restrictions are fun and these people are just the salty kids who suck.
Ok i will say Elite was a pain but why you gotta have Monkeypollis after The nerf perma spike bad for lych  CoS too Just farm and do The normal strat
This is satire right?
I'm not a tryhard rank player but I think it fine tho. It make me try new tragedies against boss
Shout out to player 3 last night that made me spend 600 mm and 45 minutes before he left so o could continue remove his perms brew and restart beat final tier within seconds because some dipshit wasn’t spamming homeland had a perms brew and elite defender what a bum wipe to player 3 I hope your toast burns for breakfast everyday
This does explain why I can't find anyone wanting to do boss battles to save my goddamn life
back then people were complaining on how bosses are just the same strat every week and now people are complaining that they cant do that anymore.You people are complaining too much
If you think rules are a problem then you're just bad.
Ah yes, I'd love to use the same exact same towers on every single boss ever without the slightest deviation from my comfort zone that is 100% guaranteed to win without any additional effort for thinking

Afterall this isn't a strategy game am I right?
this post just made me realize how bad the average player is at btd6. not meant to be an insult at all but god damn. i dont know whats dragging the average down. 5 year olds playing it on their ipad or this subreddit


if youre bad at the game go play odysees or something, they are meant to be casual
Disagree, its what keeps the bosses somewhat challenging and fun.
Otherwise there wouldn't be any difference and it would always be the same strategy and way to easy.

In other words, get good.
Lol imagine cant win cuz they removed spacktory or put a limit to how mamy snipers u can use  like only 20  if u were a ranked player imma get that u can find it hard to get decent scores with these restrictions but even then the fun part is to get a decent score with restroctions cuz otherwise its the same strategy over and over and over and over again
sorry bud but it sounds you need to adapt to these circumstances and get good
I agree that some restrictions were too much (like last week with bloonarious and no dart, boomer or bucanneer paragon plus other stuff). But youre really over reacting rn, just removing monkeyopolis plus perma spikes and carpet is not that much. Removing ben makes it more involved for having to use geraldo for nfts and paragon totems or not using heroes at all. Just dont wanna see crazy restrictions like last week, this one was fine.
This seems like a Maxlevelidot thumbnail
It's not a problem and you're wrong.
I agree we should make a petition
Genuinely I dont know how to farm enough to beat elite
There's no problem here, the restrictions are what keeps them interesting. If anything NK can just add some sort of mode without the restrictions. If you hate the restrictions, just get better at the game. Overcome your skill issue.
Ok I'm gonna say it, I like when they restrict my towers, because if they don't I'm going to do the same exact strategy, is always tack zone+1-0-4 ninja for tier 1, and yada yada yada,  almost everyone already knows the meta and it's always good to have a shift, if you're complaining it's because you can't play btd6 you just remember what towers to use at certain points off the game
Says the one who plays CHIMPS all day, perhaps
I think causal mode should allow everything and no rules cuz some players might not able to beat it with some rules and ranked mode set to what we are having right now
I mean, i don't think you would be against some rules, for example, bloons are faster, but so are cooldowns of your skills
I left boss battles because it's unfunny 
It's not too hsrd for me not to beat it but it's just no fun
It's all fun until they limit ur heroes I wanna use BEN
please, please just tell me this is satire
The thing is, it really spices up the bosses
op towers are fun, theyre only really a problem in ranked gamemodes. The solution is just "only restrict towers in ranked", besides variety is nice, using the same selection of towers in the same order with MAYBE a slight 1 tower variation between patches gets very boring.
The problem more that the rules are the players that continue posting this shit in the sub, we all know that it’s a problem and when I scroll trough the sub and only see post complaining about this and CT it’s only disturbing, they will likely not change it only if you, me or any normal player complains, they will change it probably only if YouTubers like dabloon isab ecc… complain
The bosses would be boring if they didn't make restrictions. The restrictions are to make the boss harder, not because some towers are too strong. It's more fun to have to use an actual strategy than to spam spike storms or to just have a perma-spike kill Lych. Having to use different strategies every week is something that I really enjoy.
amen bro
This. But y'all are making this a bigger problem then it needs to be
    For those of us who can manage without the best towers its not a problem, but I reckon the silent majority struggle to finish even with the best towers.
        Even for a normal player, a max of 20 sniper shouldn't be an issue. They might be more space efficient than farms, but that's it, farms are better 80% of the time. Monkeyoppolis, isn't even that good anymore, and is far from necesary. And permaspike is only use in ranked(which is done by the better half of players), or to clean up missed bloons, wich there are also otter opsions for. This event is infact one of the easier ones over the last couple of months. And if you still can't beat it, I'm sorry, but then this is not yet build for you.
            Agreed 90% except for the hero restrictions too; some people just want to chill and use Ben
                Forgot about that part. I agree
                    100% now!
            [deleted]
                Stickybomb is also great, fauto isn't realy necesary
            Exactly. Ranked sucks and only less than 1% actually use it. Get rid of it. Ninja Kiwi isn't stupid, their a little more smart and only idiots.
                just don't play it if you dislike it?
                That doesn't make any sense, and I play literally every boss game as ranked, I never try to score a good time or something I just don't like powers and enjoy extra rewards
                why would you not play ranked, its literally free rewards even if you don't try for a good time and it doesn't change the game at all
        Got to tier 3 on my own and kept dying, DDT were getting through but limited towers I know work against that boss. Annoying. Just wanted to try it myself
    >But y'all are making this a bigger problem then it needs to be

It's actually easier without them.
        Sorry, without what?
            Without these "best towers". I really dislike using permaspike and xx5 village. With them banned boss is actually easier to perform.
    I must disagree
        And why is that?
Or add a new mode even easier than normal that doesn't restrict
    Eh I feel that kinda defeats the point of the boss encounter though. Because the normal difficulty is already pretty easy if you understand what towers are best in the boss setting and elite is already hard enough to the point there's really only a select few strategies that work. Anything easier would make boss clears the equivalent of something like beating a fortified ZOMG.
Despite being in the "it's still not that hard with restrictions" camp, I'm actually all for this.
100% agree. I used Tack Zone / Super Brittle / Ninja Paragon against Lych this week and it was an absolute blast.
    Literally a basic ass strategy
        I normally use tack zone… done xD
"And, yes, build those Paragons..."  


Also NK restricting Paragons every other boss event
    Feels like paragons are the most wasted feature ever, extremely hard to get, pretty much available only for bosses or freeplay..

Someone playing the "normal, main game modes" will never make a para
        Isn't that the point though? I mean, you need expensive towers like the Legend of the Night or True Sun God never to beat the maps on any difficulty; those are more about strategy then raw power. The boss events provide a scenario to use those towers in a situation where they're actually needed.
            Yeah I understand. Bosses were designed with paragons in mind so we have them so expensive and strong for that reason. But imo feels like a waste having so many new towers effectively locked to be used only by veteran players in a very specific game mode.

We could maybe have a nerfed and cheaper to obtain version on "standard" game modes or something
                >We could maybe have a nerfed and cheaper to obtain version on "standard" game modes or something

Those are the T5 towers
            LOTN in bosses 😂
as a normal player who really isnt to great and only plays normal bosses; the only thing that actually brought me back to bosses was seeing the restrictions. it made the bosses sound more interesting and; yknow; not the same every week
    Honestly banning Monkeyopolis makes me wanna play the boss bloon more
        banning monkeypolis doesnt sound as bad with the nerf to it recently, but i kinda wonder how itll effect elite, if much at all. i guess ill only really see if theres posts about it or someone like isab makes a video because its a stand out boss event or something
            It's no big deal. I cleared elite earlier today and made a post about it. I had over 2 million leftover/unused for Tier 5.
                Cracked has so much empty space for farms too. I just filled the map with 024s and had more money than I needed.
                    Yeah. The restricted opolis isn't really felt since we can just spam farms everywhere.
        Eh I mean with the ‘opolis nerfed I don’t think it’s really going to be too much of a reliant upgrade anymore
        Found the Ninja Kiwi employee!
    for real, back when Bloonarius first came out it was literally the same strat every week until they started restricting, it was so boring
I really liked the no selling event, it was tricky but possible. If you want simplicity go play normal maps
    Yeah, no selling Logs was interesting. They've done a fairly decent job balancing the restrictions. No selling happened on Logs, with insane track length. This week, no monkeyopolis but they removed 50 tower restriction, so we can spam farms everywhere.
        Every event Seems to be restricted enought to be original and tricky but not too restricted to be boring. Every big restriction like paragon ban is balanced with a longer map or some diffrent shit. Since more paragons are coming out without restrictions every boss would just be a "farm like crazy and always go for the best paragons that other people calculated" situation.
    Lmao imagine if there was a least cash or a least tiers boss
        That would be poggers
        Would the leaderboard be have Cash/Tiers used instead of or alonside time? 'Cause that would be interesting
            Time attack boss event. Imagine sending all the boss tiers at once
                There can only be one boss bloon on the screen at once though so the second you send a second one out, you'd instantly lose
                    Well, no. If there is more than 1 boss at once, you will just see the HP of the first one. The second one will work normally you just wont see his HP. NK could make it so if there are 2 boss bloons or more, the HP bar just scales so the second one can appear
    Ah my first boss, it was fair to add some difficulty considering it was the easiest map in the game
    Not gonna lie, a no farms event would actually be hella fun. The first two tiers of boss are usually doable without any farms, and you could use alternate money methods like sniper and boat farming for the other tiers.

Only problem is people like this would cry this subreddit to death
        > Not gonna lie, a no farms event would actually be hella fun. The first two tiers of boss are usually doable without any farms, and you could use alternate money methods like sniper and boat farming for the other tiers.

Have fun trying to play that shit on any Elite boss on any tier beyond 2. Spamming supply drop = fun?
        Spice islands or lotus island would be hella fun without farms since ppl would boat or snpier farm. I wouldnt ban farms entirely but only leave 204 farms to Buff merchantmen and to have some good early game with marketplaces
            I'm just gonna try bosses without banana farms every week from now on
    My favorite was the one on spice islands since it was made before merchantmen farming was considered viable, and getting a high-tier paragon for anything other than boat was out of the question, which made parts like the t4 elite interesting since you would have to give up your farming for a paragon.
I agree, but I think the restrictions on farming, a core part of bosses is stupid. No Benjamin and no monkeyopolis? Makes no sense
    Do you see them banning farming completely?? Farming is entirely possible, and is done all the time, without monkeyopolis or ben. Especially since Monkeyopolis has been nerfed to such a low level of hell that it's literally not worth using on the majority of boss runs anymore
        which path is monkeyopolis again?
            bottom path village
                thank you :)
        I don’t think they’ll ever ban it, but banning any part just makes elite stupidly hard just because you don’t have money. This week banned all banana farms, the literal main part of farming
The problem with it is I can't even get used to the bosses or learn how to play them because the restrictions are so challenging. It feels like I'm being punished for not being there at the beginning. I can beat all of the normal gamemodes, but the bosses are so much different.

A simple solution would be to have a sort of practice mode where there are no restrictions so that players who don't have much experience with bosses can learn how to do them
    normal boss.
The bosses, especially on expert, are already really hard unless you're constantly looking up ideal meta strats for each one. Even just changing the maps makes certain strats no longer viable. There's a difference between challenging but doable and just plain impossible unless you're an insanely dedicated player who constantly stays on top of the meta and watches content creators on a regular basis.
    No they’re not. I’m a fairly casual player and don’t really follow the meta but I had absolutely no difficulty whatsoever with bosses before restrictions, that they got very boring and stale very quickly. Restrictions are important for bosses to stay interesting.
NK said get good
I feel like its their game and they know whats best for it. If you dislike what they are doing with bosses just dont play them. If you enjoy bosses then you will play them even with restrictions. Like i do.

I see bosses as a test of knowlege on the game. "Ok so you used this last time? Try something else look for a solution". it enables critical thinking and anylizing your arsenal. I am a firm beliver that if you dont enjoy something in a game then its not meant for you.

I say best solution to this is either creating a third "casual" mode to a boss where its just the map and difficulty setting. But you have to understand that those shouldnt have any rewards at all, if you want rewards beat a challenge. The other would be to choose a special boss difficulty on any map you want but the rewards should be same as chimpa for example. You get 900MM for the first time beating then repeats are lest efficient. 

I see nothing wrong with what NK is doing to bosses and it keeps the game fresh. Stop whining that you basically cant get free rewards for doing the same fucking strat each week. There is a reason for these restrictions and its rewards.
    Exactly!
Dude, just add another fucking mode that doesn't have restrictions. For the life of me I have no idea why people are so against this.

"But it's supposed to be hard." Great, so play with the restrictions if you want. But if people want to be able to play without restrictions, let them. It literally does not affect you at all.
    Ninjakiwi might be against this if it costs too much to make.  We don't know what it will cost them.  But as someone who is pro-restrictions I don't see anything wrong against people playing without restrictions.
It should be optional so we can have the time to practice on normal before moving up and on to modifiers.
Ex-fvcking-actly
It's not that this particular boss event is uniquely challenging or irritating. Banning Monkeyopolis is very much the straw breaking the camel's back, from restricting the amount of towers you can get for Dart Monkey/Boomerang/other paragons to 2 so you can't get the paragon, to deleting selling, I'm just fed up with being unable to play boss events because NK keeps reflexively banning things.
    You're still able to play. You just need to employ different strategies.
    To be fair opolis did get nerfed so I don't think it's much of a big deal that it's banned
    bosses are not for everyone lol..... elite is meant to be for the competitive players and you dont have to play ranked and you are suggested to use powers if you are incapable of beating it.

Btw people complaiend that all they did was use one strat to beat the boss. So they made restrictions to satisfy many people as otherwise they would be bored of doing it.
        I remember a while ago when I basically had over 5 mil left over on elite every week. It’s finally nice to actually see some challenging bosses and switch up strategies
    then practice, if you are fed up of being unable to beat the bosses its because you arent skilled enough to beat them. Im not trying to insult, everyone starts off bad and everyone learns the game to a point where they are good
    Just coz you suck at the game doesn’t mean you gotta cry about it
Yeah hard agree there, I think the point isn't to balance the event but to keep it fresh. If you find this week's restrictions too hard then oh well you can skip it. You'll live.
Git gud
    🤨
    Lol now I'm confused🤣
Unpopular opinion indeed. dont restrict my fun for yours. Play ranked, which we propose is where all the restrictions should be. Whenever you play any map, do you always just go meta ninja +alch? Its the best strat and there's no restrictions on it. But i dont go that all the time, i like to mix things up on my own to keep it fresh.
    [deleted]
        This is such an absurd take.

Why should they not be able to play bosses without restrictions if they want to? How does them being able to do that affect you at all?
            [deleted]
                That's not what you're saying. They're asking to have a version of bosses that they would enjoy, and you're saying "you don't deserve that, if you don't like bosses you should just not play them."

That's a dumb take, period. There's nothing fundamentally wrong with a version of bosses that doesn't have restrictions. Literally, there is absolutely no reason not to have that, and if it *were* added a bunch of people who currently don't play bosses because of the restrictions would have a new mode they'd enjoy.

Stop gatekeeping people's fun.
                    [deleted]
                        If you don't have a problem with a mode that doesn't have restrictions, don't say "why do you have to enjoy everything in the game? if you don't like bosses don't play them." Say "yeah, it would be cool if there was a mode that didn't have restrictions so people like you could enjoy bosses too."
                            yeah, it would be cool if there was a mode that didn't have restrictions and rewards

Here, do you like it?
    Ninja Alch is not the ”meta” it’s just the easiest strategy bad players can figure out
        "the best strategy most people use" is literally the meta dude

the fact a better strategy that no one uses can exist does not mean the best one that people use isn't meta
            “Meta” is what produces best results, not what most people use
                no it isn't lmfao

if a strat no one uses but hypothetically produces the best results exists but again, NOT A SINGLE PERSON USES IT EVER that is not the "meta strat"

literally by that logic you could never call anything meta because some hypothetical better thing could be out there that would be the real meta despite no one finding it yet.

this argument has reached my limit for arguing with stupid people on the internet for the day. bye.
            Meta literally stands for most effective tactic available what does that have to do with use rates
                That is a backronym that has never accurately represented what the majority of people mean when they say "Meta"/"metagame".
    Bosses aren’t for causal players like you
        Feel free to link me evidence showing me Ninjakiwis' statement that bosses are only for the top2% of players like isab. The boss event on non-ranked should be fun for everyone, but it isnt.
            Another guy said 

This is lifted from v27 patch notes (when they introduced Boss events):

Difficulty Fair Warning - Bosses are designed to be crazy challenging! If you are new to BTD6, make sure you can win most hard modes and really know how to farm well and maximize tower damage before you take on a Boss. Expect defeat. Nay, revel in it - bathe in anguish then emerge smarter, more capable, and with improved tactics that help you get further each time. If you have built up a stockpile of Powers and Insta Monkeys, feel free to use them - they are not required but they are certainly fair game. And, yes, build those Paragons...

Boss events are not meant to be simple. The restrictions are meant to keep things spicy and tricky each week.. Otherwise, it'll get boring real fast if the map is the only thing that's changing every week..
                Owned
                Thanks for this. So NK just doesn't understand what fun is, "crazy challening" my ass. Nk are fooling themselves if they dont think half the people completing the hard weeks of boss events weren't using a youtube guide.
                    Odyssey is for causal players like you but bosses are meant for pro’s
                        The patch notes said it was "crazy challenging" but it didnt say you had to be pro-level like Isab. And i aint a casual kid.
                            Lmao you don’t need to be Isab to know how to play
                                Glad we both agree on a point i didnt make.
                            lmao you dont need to be isab level, if you have a decent understanding of how to beat chimps on intermediate to advanced maps you should be about ready to handle bosses
                                Then why are you arguing with me, and not the person directly above my comment who said, QUOTE for QUOTE "bosses are meant for pros"?
                > Difficulty Fair Warning - Bosses are designed to be crazy challenging! If you are new to BTD6, make sure you can win most hard modes and really know how to farm well and maximize tower damage before you take on a Boss. 

We do, NK; and then you fucking ban it.
            Literally the patch notes, check out the second-top comment on this post.
                Answer me this then: if bosses are only for "pros"  why is there even a difference between ranked and unranked? After all, pros dont need to use powers or insta-monkeys!
                    Because they appeal to two different types of players? Ranked is for speedrunners. Not all pros are speedrunners. Also, MONKE FARMER
                        Lmao you said nothing. Speedrunning has nothing to do with the mode's difficulty. For thd targeted demographic of the boss event, pros or people who like crazy challenges, ranked and unranked have 0 differences.
                            These are not “crazy challenges”. Even if you’re just decently ok at the game you should be able to beat most boss weeks.
                                I am just quoting the patch notes that were provided to me my guy. Bring that up to Ninjakiwi.
                            Dude. Are you seriously saying Speed running has ZERO differences compared to the normal boss? 

If that's the case then why are races hard? And why are races in contested territory?
                                ...Are you being stupid on purpose?
I said that you said "nothing" because speedrunning had nothing to do with the differences between ranked and unranked, the differences, the ONLY difference that has an impact on gameplay is that ranked bans powers and instad, while unranked doesnt.
But hey- thats a good effective technique for arguing you've got there i'll give you credit. Steet away the conversation from what we're talking about to deflect the fact you dont have much to say.
    The only problem with this is cost to Ninjakiwi.  If it costs Ninjakiwi too much to make a no restrictions mode then they won't do it.  But if this isn't going to be a problem then I don't see a problem with what you're suggesting.
    Get better at the game
    well i see your point but the bosses are meant to be a challenge for more experienced players, and there would be no feeling of fun or reward if bosses could be beaten the same exact way every week. having to figure out a strategy that works even with the restrictions in place is part of the fun of boss events. And yes changing up your strategy on your own is nice but in something as challenging as boss events, people wouldn't want to try something new because why would they? If something works reliably every time, why would they put in the effort to try something else?

thank you for coming to my ted talk
Or, maybe you can do that yourself? If you have a problem with the mode not being fresh, make it fresh yourself and not use those towers, let other people have fun and challenge yourself.
    That's not how that works. That's like saying exploitfix mods in Bethesda games are purposeless cuz you can just "not do the exploit."

NK doesn't want you doing a certain thing for a certain run; get over yourself and just don't do the thing at all if you don't like it.
        >  you can just "not do the exploit."

but you literally can just not do the exploit, or you can be fine with doing the exploits and do them but then you wouldn't be someone getting a mod to fix them in the first place. it's not like anyone is forcing you to do these exploits or even a leaderboard that you need to compete on "force" you to use them.
            Why do the mods exist, and get downloaded highly, if you can just "not do it"?

Think for a bit outside of common sense, which you clearly do have and are arguing on behalf of. Somehow I made that sound like an insult.
                > Think for a bit outside of common sense, which you clearly do have and are arguing on behalf of. Somehow I made that sound like an insult.

unsure if this was sarcasm or not, but i'm going to assume it's not. i'd imagine it gets downloaded because people follow a thought process of "well if it's there i'm going to do it because it's the best way to do it, but if i download a mod to fix it then i won't be tempted by it anymore"
                    Temptation, spot on yeah. Temptation gets many many people! It gets me too. Being forced out of temptation is a very cool thing in the end, because I like to struggle but my natural thought process while struggling is "ok how can I not"
    "Every game mode should give infinite lives, if you want a challenge just put in a no lives lost rule for yourself."
This is what I'm saying! Lol kid just wants it easy all the time.
    I bet some people would ALWAYS spam the same towers during the same rounds and call themselves good  


And to be fair it's not even fun to use the same strategy always, at least like this you can also see what other towers are good for this mode
        Yea like druid farming 👍
    Try not to listen to this insect too much. A fruit fly's buzz is much more discernible than a bumble bee's.
        Calm down master oogway 

I'd bet that without restrictions, even unranked normal would lose most of its players after a month

        🤓
        Skill issue?
The solution to this is to nerf the overused towers or buff the underused ones, not disallow them entirely.
    nerfing or buffing stuff purely based off of how they do in certain mods like bosses or races seems like a slippery slope

some stuff is obviously fine if it realistically would never effect the other modes but otherwise i feel like that could lead to issues

plus, there will always be meta towers that are better than others, itd probably be impossible to make everything equally as good, especially in situations like bosses
        Indeed  
Couldn't have said it better myself  
Heck immagine if they nerfed paragons just because they do good against bosses, when in reality some towers like Ninjas do better as separate tier 5's
        why would you name the fallacy you're making in your argument?

the slippery slope is literally one of the most famous fallacies come on guys
    its not done out of a balance decision, its just to spice things up for that one event, and to make each event feel more distinct from eachother
Tower Defense games **are** about finding the dominant strategy, though. Find the towers that are most effective, then use them liberally.
    [deleted]
        Me when I can’t just put down dart paragon on r80 and afk on normal 😭😭😭
    If you use the same strategy every time it becomes boring
        Yeah gee, I wonder why the videos that reach people outside of a games yt ecosystem always seem to be the "I'm gonna play X but with self imposed restriction Y" ones, it's almost as if they do better.
            It's almost as if banning yourself from using the meta makes it a challenge and thus entertaining.
    “I cant defend rounds 30-50 with Ninja Alch on Flooded Valley?!?!?? Poorly designed map”-🤓
        lmao i love this
    Me after bbing every single maps in btd6 with 0-3-2 snipers plus Geraldo 😴😴
It's not though. For challenges and odysseys the rules are basically the whole mode. Without them you're just playing normal games on random maps. And for races the point is to compete.

None of that applies to boss events. Having an easy mode that's just the normal mode boss with no restrictions doesn't hurt anything.
This did give me an idea.
People don't seem to understand that any game **is** about using the dominant strategy, and the challenge comes from finding it. You wouldn't use Total Transformation or Plasma Monkey Fan Club, because that's not effective. Changing the dominant strategy, limiting towers, is **moving the goal post,** it's bad design.
    Just find another strat. Use another farming strat, or something
        Yeah he says that like it's the ONLY good strat. It's also a heavier micro start - this is a great one for idle since you can squeeze 5 boats and a ton of bottom path farms since there's no monkeyopolis. Then just ninja paragon and win. Only hard part is going for a faster score on ranked
    How is forcing players to adapt to the circumstances and finding a new strategy bad design? This is no different than using a different tower combination to beat an Expert map compared to an Easy map. 

Edit: By your definition, games that have frequent balance updates are bad games because they constantly force the playerbase to find a new meta.
        > games that have frequent balance updates are bad games

These are actually bad. If “balance” updates are done mostly to “shake the meta”, that game has no balance, and its devs aren't even trying to reach one
    Only using the dominant strategy in this game is boring as hell.
    its not moving the goal post, its testing your game knowledge, you say yourself the challenge comes from finding the best strategy, so wouldn't limiting certain towers each event actually spark that challenge? since then you gotta try to find what is your best option on the fly instead of just "well this always works so keep doing it every event"
    “Yeah man I just wanna play the same 4 towers every game and never get bored of doing the exact same thing”
    you're right, that's why the game is balanced to create a diverse set of situational options that require adapting to different conditions within the base game. if its such a big part of the game, then it wouldn't be very fun or challenging if you just ~~copied~~ found the single best strategy and never bothered again. they're not balanced with regards bosses or races, which is why they remove problematic towers to maintain a large pool of viable and competitive options to choose from.

if you can't win without monkeyopolis, then iunno; maybe you should work on finding the most optimal strategy with the options you're given or something like that.
    So the Challenge is going to YouTube to see what the best strategy is?
        No - the challenge is to figure out what is the best strategy given the restrictions.
    ***IS*** there even a dominant strategy?
        Yes there's a meta dominant strategy for beating bosses and there are some people who seem to dislike any restrictions that disrupt that.
    No its putting obstacles in the way, your strat usually only needs to be adapted and not completely altered, but you have several days to figure it out and thats the fun of it, especially if you have a friend to think things over with
"A bloon that is a lot harder than something you would see in regular play"

Honestly now I kinda want freeplay to have boss bloons every 20 rounds starting at round 220
    The problem then would just be the lag
        Round 200+ is already unbearably laggy as is, might as well get some new frames to look at
Nobody is complaining about restrictions in Elite mode, or even Ranked mode. They’re meant to be challenges for the best / most well-equipped players and everyone is fine with that.

Normal mode should be a bit more accessible to let normal people get a chance to enjoy bosses. If you don’t do them, a huge part of the game is cut off from you.
    to those saying "normal mode is easy you can use anything and still win."

I tried normal mode on a boss event with no restrictions, tried using my own strategy...

I didn't even get to tier 1
        Yeah, it‘s just people who base their entire life around the game and have lost all connection with reality and with how 99% of players play.
        I mean, you can pretty easily use your own strat as long as you recognise what’s important.

If you just put random things everywhere or try to play it like a normal game, you’re bound to lose, but barring elite, boss bloons are genuinely fine if you approach them properly.
        get good then lmao i seriously dont know what to tell you if you cannot beat tier 1 normal without meta abusing
    Normal mode is already very easy(that’s the point of it) all of the complaints I have seen so far was that elite mode is hard because it has restrictions.
    Normal mode is incredibly easy. I don’t think there has ever been a boss that was difficult on normal mode other than that week with Vortex on chutes.
        😂
    Normal mode is incredibly trivial already. you can use just about any strategy and win easily in normal mode.
        Sure, Jan.

It is. Bosses are not playable until they take the shackles off of players. And demeaning someone's hobby, saying it's less serious or important than other things, is something I'm familiar with, and it's never welcome.
    Bruh if you dont like this boss than just skip it and go for a walk or something
        You have done nothing but prove my point.
            Someone sounds like they don’t get pleasured
            No. no they didnt.
            Whatever you say
    Get good at the game. They’re supposed to be hard. Go play logs easy a few times if you wanna use your dominant strategy all the time.
        I think just because their intended to be hard does not mean there shouldn't be a "easy" mode that allows almost anyone to accomplish it

It does not harm anyone in anyone by having a easier mode
    You are Literally unskilled 👍🏻
    Wah wah wahhhh
"It's not that serious."

Tell me you're a sweat that puts 168 hours a week into BTD6 without telling me you're a sweat that puts 168 hours a week into BTD6.
    Im not at all, its just not the end of the world. Watch a guide or dont participate if you dont want to. Nobody is forcing you to play it.
        The problem is that people can't do it without a guide, even it normal mode sometimes, despite wanting to play it. There's no fun in doing it but following someone else's instructions for a lot of people.
            Then learn some strategies or something its no different than chimps on hard maps.
                Bro really just said get good 💀
                    -They allowed all 5 paragons without restriction

-There's enough room for 5 boats easily which can get a semi decent boat farm.

-You can use Geraldo for a little extra cash and utility powers lych can't steal.  
Not to mention 20 snipers you can combo with Geraldo's ability potion for great farming late game on top of the other stuff. 


Pick any paragon or make a VSTG. The restrictions on this one are so light and you get a ton of map space. I played this one like garbage and still beat it with a score under 15 minutes on ranked. 

The hardest part is knowing placements and order, but if that's giving you trouble, you probably do need a guide until you get the hang of it.
                        The point isn't that I can't beat it, or that this one is particularly hard, it's the repeated general restrictions.
                ok I get what you're trying to say but you chose a bad comparison, playing C.H.I.M.P.S in general is completely different than playing a boss event in many ways.
            [deleted]
                The problem is that it's just not fun for most. I can beat it, but that doesn't mean it's fun, because of the restrictions. The problem is worse for those who can't beat it.
                    [deleted]
                        Have you read the post you're commenting under? This is far from the only post like it. Also, your way of playing strategy games doesn't apply to everyone. Some like to stick with what they know and like, rather than use things they don't know.
                            [deleted]
                                I can just as easily say your opinion is shitpost tier garbage. The elite bosses are meant to be challenging, but the normal ones are supposed to be accessible to everyone, which isn't the case with a lot of the restrictions. As has already been suggested, the restrictions should be in ranked mode only, meaning casual players don't suffer from the optimisations of tryhards.
            Who tf can’t even beat normal with a guide 💀
    Wouldnt a sweat tell you that is that serious......

    But downvotes can
    Oh yes what a great example (makes no sense btw)
Sorry my bad
Avoid using buffs, and paragons are always good but if you really wanna avoid using then spamming cost effective tier 5s should be enough for normal
    It felt like no matter how much damage I did or how quickly I kill the husk it restores it’s health too fast
        Read up a bit on how lych works, when i say dont use buffs I mean active buffs (aka charge buffs) because lych is able to sap them (basically storing its hp and stunning the towers who had buffs) so avoid using towers like alchemist, call to arms, homeland defense, perma charge, overclock etc, villages are fine outside of x4x and x5x
            Ah okay, I’ll do that then. Thank you for the help!
That wouldn’t be a “boss”.
    Hey, uh what about you shut up it’s easy mode stop complaining
    You rather lesser skilled players just not be able to enjoy this part of the game?
They are not that much harder, just coz you can’t drop a dart paragon on round 80 and afk farm doesn’t mean it’s impossible
but it does seem like OP is being genuine in the comments
If you need to spend money to beat it instead of looking up a guide you deserve to spend ur money

Do not listen to this insect. A fruit fly only sounds like a bee for intimidation. It can't hurt you.
For those of us who can manage without the best towers its not a problem, but I reckon the silent majority struggle to finish even with the best towers.
    Even for a normal player, a max of 20 sniper shouldn't be an issue. They might be more space efficient than farms, but that's it, farms are better 80% of the time. Monkeyoppolis, isn't even that good anymore, and is far from necesary. And permaspike is only use in ranked(which is done by the better half of players), or to clean up missed bloons, wich there are also otter opsions for. This event is infact one of the easier ones over the last couple of months. And if you still can't beat it, I'm sorry, but then this is not yet build for you.
        Agreed 90% except for the hero restrictions too; some people just want to chill and use Ben
            Forgot about that part. I agree
                100% now!
        [deleted]
            Stickybomb is also great, fauto isn't realy necesary
        Exactly. Ranked sucks and only less than 1% actually use it. Get rid of it. Ninja Kiwi isn't stupid, their a little more smart and only idiots.
            just don't play it if you dislike it?
            That doesn't make any sense, and I play literally every boss game as ranked, I never try to score a good time or something I just don't like powers and enjoy extra rewards
            why would you not play ranked, its literally free rewards even if you don't try for a good time and it doesn't change the game at all
    Got to tier 3 on my own and kept dying, DDT were getting through but limited towers I know work against that boss. Annoying. Just wanted to try it myself
>But y'all are making this a bigger problem then it needs to be

It's actually easier without them.
    Sorry, without what?
        Without these "best towers". I really dislike using permaspike and xx5 village. With them banned boss is actually easier to perform.
I must disagree
    And why is that?
Eh I feel that kinda defeats the point of the boss encounter though. Because the normal difficulty is already pretty easy if you understand what towers are best in the boss setting and elite is already hard enough to the point there's really only a select few strategies that work. Anything easier would make boss clears the equivalent of something like beating a fortified ZOMG.
Literally a basic ass strategy
    I normally use tack zone… done xD
Feels like paragons are the most wasted feature ever, extremely hard to get, pretty much available only for bosses or freeplay..

Someone playing the "normal, main game modes" will never make a para
    Isn't that the point though? I mean, you need expensive towers like the Legend of the Night or True Sun God never to beat the maps on any difficulty; those are more about strategy then raw power. The boss events provide a scenario to use those towers in a situation where they're actually needed.
        Yeah I understand. Bosses were designed with paragons in mind so we have them so expensive and strong for that reason. But imo feels like a waste having so many new towers effectively locked to be used only by veteran players in a very specific game mode.

We could maybe have a nerfed and cheaper to obtain version on "standard" game modes or something
            >We could maybe have a nerfed and cheaper to obtain version on "standard" game modes or something

Those are the T5 towers
        LOTN in bosses 😂
Honestly banning Monkeyopolis makes me wanna play the boss bloon more
    banning monkeypolis doesnt sound as bad with the nerf to it recently, but i kinda wonder how itll effect elite, if much at all. i guess ill only really see if theres posts about it or someone like isab makes a video because its a stand out boss event or something
        It's no big deal. I cleared elite earlier today and made a post about it. I had over 2 million leftover/unused for Tier 5.
            Cracked has so much empty space for farms too. I just filled the map with 024s and had more money than I needed.
                Yeah. The restricted opolis isn't really felt since we can just spam farms everywhere.
    Eh I mean with the ‘opolis nerfed I don’t think it’s really going to be too much of a reliant upgrade anymore
    Found the Ninja Kiwi employee!
for real, back when Bloonarius first came out it was literally the same strat every week until they started restricting, it was so boring
Yeah, no selling Logs was interesting. They've done a fairly decent job balancing the restrictions. No selling happened on Logs, with insane track length. This week, no monkeyopolis but they removed 50 tower restriction, so we can spam farms everywhere.
    Every event Seems to be restricted enought to be original and tricky but not too restricted to be boring. Every big restriction like paragon ban is balanced with a longer map or some diffrent shit. Since more paragons are coming out without restrictions every boss would just be a "farm like crazy and always go for the best paragons that other people calculated" situation.
Lmao imagine if there was a least cash or a least tiers boss
    That would be poggers
    Would the leaderboard be have Cash/Tiers used instead of or alonside time? 'Cause that would be interesting
        Time attack boss event. Imagine sending all the boss tiers at once
            There can only be one boss bloon on the screen at once though so the second you send a second one out, you'd instantly lose
                Well, no. If there is more than 1 boss at once, you will just see the HP of the first one. The second one will work normally you just wont see his HP. NK could make it so if there are 2 boss bloons or more, the HP bar just scales so the second one can appear
Ah my first boss, it was fair to add some difficulty considering it was the easiest map in the game
Not gonna lie, a no farms event would actually be hella fun. The first two tiers of boss are usually doable without any farms, and you could use alternate money methods like sniper and boat farming for the other tiers.

Only problem is people like this would cry this subreddit to death
    > Not gonna lie, a no farms event would actually be hella fun. The first two tiers of boss are usually doable without any farms, and you could use alternate money methods like sniper and boat farming for the other tiers.

Have fun trying to play that shit on any Elite boss on any tier beyond 2. Spamming supply drop = fun?
    Spice islands or lotus island would be hella fun without farms since ppl would boat or snpier farm. I wouldnt ban farms entirely but only leave 204 farms to Buff merchantmen and to have some good early game with marketplaces
        I'm just gonna try bosses without banana farms every week from now on
My favorite was the one on spice islands since it was made before merchantmen farming was considered viable, and getting a high-tier paragon for anything other than boat was out of the question, which made parts like the t4 elite interesting since you would have to give up your farming for a paragon.
Do you see them banning farming completely?? Farming is entirely possible, and is done all the time, without monkeyopolis or ben. Especially since Monkeyopolis has been nerfed to such a low level of hell that it's literally not worth using on the majority of boss runs anymore
    which path is monkeyopolis again?
        bottom path village
            thank you :)
    I don’t think they’ll ever ban it, but banning any part just makes elite stupidly hard just because you don’t have money. This week banned all banana farms, the literal main part of farming
normal boss.
No they’re not. I’m a fairly casual player and don’t really follow the meta but I had absolutely no difficulty whatsoever with bosses before restrictions, that they got very boring and stale very quickly. Restrictions are important for bosses to stay interesting.
Exactly!
Ninjakiwi might be against this if it costs too much to make.  We don't know what it will cost them.  But as someone who is pro-restrictions I don't see anything wrong against people playing without restrictions.
You're still able to play. You just need to employ different strategies.
To be fair opolis did get nerfed so I don't think it's much of a big deal that it's banned
bosses are not for everyone lol..... elite is meant to be for the competitive players and you dont have to play ranked and you are suggested to use powers if you are incapable of beating it.

Btw people complaiend that all they did was use one strat to beat the boss. So they made restrictions to satisfy many people as otherwise they would be bored of doing it.
    I remember a while ago when I basically had over 5 mil left over on elite every week. It’s finally nice to actually see some challenging bosses and switch up strategies
then practice, if you are fed up of being unable to beat the bosses its because you arent skilled enough to beat them. Im not trying to insult, everyone starts off bad and everyone learns the game to a point where they are good
Just coz you suck at the game doesn’t mean you gotta cry about it
🤨
Lol now I'm confused🤣
[deleted]
    This is such an absurd take.

Why should they not be able to play bosses without restrictions if they want to? How does them being able to do that affect you at all?
        [deleted]
            That's not what you're saying. They're asking to have a version of bosses that they would enjoy, and you're saying "you don't deserve that, if you don't like bosses you should just not play them."

That's a dumb take, period. There's nothing fundamentally wrong with a version of bosses that doesn't have restrictions. Literally, there is absolutely no reason not to have that, and if it *were* added a bunch of people who currently don't play bosses because of the restrictions would have a new mode they'd enjoy.

Stop gatekeeping people's fun.
                [deleted]
                    If you don't have a problem with a mode that doesn't have restrictions, don't say "why do you have to enjoy everything in the game? if you don't like bosses don't play them." Say "yeah, it would be cool if there was a mode that didn't have restrictions so people like you could enjoy bosses too."
                        yeah, it would be cool if there was a mode that didn't have restrictions and rewards

Here, do you like it?
Ninja Alch is not the ”meta” it’s just the easiest strategy bad players can figure out
    "the best strategy most people use" is literally the meta dude

the fact a better strategy that no one uses can exist does not mean the best one that people use isn't meta
        “Meta” is what produces best results, not what most people use
            no it isn't lmfao

if a strat no one uses but hypothetically produces the best results exists but again, NOT A SINGLE PERSON USES IT EVER that is not the "meta strat"

literally by that logic you could never call anything meta because some hypothetical better thing could be out there that would be the real meta despite no one finding it yet.

this argument has reached my limit for arguing with stupid people on the internet for the day. bye.
        Meta literally stands for most effective tactic available what does that have to do with use rates
            That is a backronym that has never accurately represented what the majority of people mean when they say "Meta"/"metagame".
Bosses aren’t for causal players like you

This is lifted from v27 patch notes (when they introduced Boss events):

Difficulty Fair Warning - Bosses are designed to be crazy challenging! If you are new to BTD6, make sure you can win most hard modes and really know how to farm well and maximize tower damage before you take on a Boss. Expect defeat. Nay, revel in it - bathe in anguish then emerge smarter, more capable, and with improved tactics that help you get further each time. If you have built up a stockpile of Powers and Insta Monkeys, feel free to use them - they are not required but they are certainly fair game. And, yes, build those Paragons...

Boss events are not meant to be simple. The restrictions are meant to keep things spicy and tricky each week.. Otherwise, it'll get boring real fast if the map is the only thing that's changing every week..

            Thanks for this. So NK just doesn't understand what fun is, "crazy challening" my ass. Nk are fooling themselves if they dont think half the people completing the hard weeks of boss events weren't using a youtube guide.
                Odyssey is for causal players like you but bosses are meant for pro’s
                    The patch notes said it was "crazy challenging" but it didnt say you had to be pro-level like Isab. And i aint a casual kid.
                        Lmao you don’t need to be Isab to know how to play
                            Glad we both agree on a point i didnt make.
                        lmao you dont need to be isab level, if you have a decent understanding of how to beat chimps on intermediate to advanced maps you should be about ready to handle bosses
                            Then why are you arguing with me, and not the person directly above my comment who said, QUOTE for QUOTE "bosses are meant for pros"?

We do, NK; and then you fucking ban it.
        Literally the patch notes, check out the second-top comment on this post.
            Answer me this then: if bosses are only for "pros"  why is there even a difference between ranked and unranked? After all, pros dont need to use powers or insta-monkeys!
                Because they appeal to two different types of players? Ranked is for speedrunners. Not all pros are speedrunners. Also, MONKE FARMER
                    Lmao you said nothing. Speedrunning has nothing to do with the mode's difficulty. For thd targeted demographic of the boss event, pros or people who like crazy challenges, ranked and unranked have 0 differences.
                        These are not “crazy challenges”. Even if you’re just decently ok at the game you should be able to beat most boss weeks.
                            I am just quoting the patch notes that were provided to me my guy. Bring that up to Ninjakiwi.
                        Dude. Are you seriously saying Speed running has ZERO differences compared to the normal boss? 

If that's the case then why are races hard? And why are races in contested territory?
                            ...Are you being stupid on purpose?
I said that you said "nothing" because speedrunning had nothing to do with the differences between ranked and unranked, the differences, the ONLY difference that has an impact on gameplay is that ranked bans powers and instad, while unranked doesnt.
But hey- thats a good effective technique for arguing you've got there i'll give you credit. Steet away the conversation from what we're talking about to deflect the fact you dont have much to say.
The only problem with this is cost to Ninjakiwi.  If it costs Ninjakiwi too much to make a no restrictions mode then they won't do it.  But if this isn't going to be a problem then I don't see a problem with what you're suggesting.
Get better at the game
well i see your point but the bosses are meant to be a challenge for more experienced players, and there would be no feeling of fun or reward if bosses could be beaten the same exact way every week. having to figure out a strategy that works even with the restrictions in place is part of the fun of boss events. And yes changing up your strategy on your own is nice but in something as challenging as boss events, people wouldn't want to try something new because why would they? If something works reliably every time, why would they put in the effort to try something else?

thank you for coming to my ted talk
That's not how that works. That's like saying exploitfix mods in Bethesda games are purposeless cuz you can just "not do the exploit."

NK doesn't want you doing a certain thing for a certain run; get over yourself and just don't do the thing at all if you don't like it.
    >  you can just "not do the exploit."

but you literally can just not do the exploit, or you can be fine with doing the exploits and do them but then you wouldn't be someone getting a mod to fix them in the first place. it's not like anyone is forcing you to do these exploits or even a leaderboard that you need to compete on "force" you to use them.
        Why do the mods exist, and get downloaded highly, if you can just "not do it"?

Think for a bit outside of common sense, which you clearly do have and are arguing on behalf of. Somehow I made that sound like an insult.
            > Think for a bit outside of common sense, which you clearly do have and are arguing on behalf of. Somehow I made that sound like an insult.

unsure if this was sarcasm or not, but i'm going to assume it's not. i'd imagine it gets downloaded because people follow a thought process of "well if it's there i'm going to do it because it's the best way to do it, but if i download a mod to fix it then i won't be tempted by it anymore"
                Temptation, spot on yeah. Temptation gets many many people! It gets me too. Being forced out of temptation is a very cool thing in the end, because I like to struggle but my natural thought process while struggling is "ok how can I not"
"Every game mode should give infinite lives, if you want a challenge just put in a no lives lost rule for yourself."
I bet some people would ALWAYS spam the same towers during the same rounds and call themselves good  


And to be fair it's not even fun to use the same strategy always, at least like this you can also see what other towers are good for this mode
    Yea like druid farming 👍
Try not to listen to this insect too much. A fruit fly's buzz is much more discernible than a bumble bee's.
    Calm down master oogway 

I'd bet that without restrictions, even unranked normal would lose most of its players after a month

    🤓
    Skill issue?
nerfing or buffing stuff purely based off of how they do in certain mods like bosses or races seems like a slippery slope

some stuff is obviously fine if it realistically would never effect the other modes but otherwise i feel like that could lead to issues

plus, there will always be meta towers that are better than others, itd probably be impossible to make everything equally as good, especially in situations like bosses
    Indeed  
Couldn't have said it better myself  
Heck immagine if they nerfed paragons just because they do good against bosses, when in reality some towers like Ninjas do better as separate tier 5's
    why would you name the fallacy you're making in your argument?

the slippery slope is literally one of the most famous fallacies come on guys
its not done out of a balance decision, its just to spice things up for that one event, and to make each event feel more distinct from eachother
[deleted]
    Me when I can’t just put down dart paragon on r80 and afk on normal 😭😭😭
If you use the same strategy every time it becomes boring
    Yeah gee, I wonder why the videos that reach people outside of a games yt ecosystem always seem to be the "I'm gonna play X but with self imposed restriction Y" ones, it's almost as if they do better.
        It's almost as if banning yourself from using the meta makes it a challenge and thus entertaining.
“I cant defend rounds 30-50 with Ninja Alch on Flooded Valley?!?!?? Poorly designed map”-🤓
    lmao i love this
Me after bbing every single maps in btd6 with 0-3-2 snipers plus Geraldo 😴😴
Just find another strat. Use another farming strat, or something
    Yeah he says that like it's the ONLY good strat. It's also a heavier micro start - this is a great one for idle since you can squeeze 5 boats and a ton of bottom path farms since there's no monkeyopolis. Then just ninja paragon and win. Only hard part is going for a faster score on ranked
How is forcing players to adapt to the circumstances and finding a new strategy bad design? This is no different than using a different tower combination to beat an Expert map compared to an Easy map. 

Edit: By your definition, games that have frequent balance updates are bad games because they constantly force the playerbase to find a new meta.
    > games that have frequent balance updates are bad games

These are actually bad. If “balance” updates are done mostly to “shake the meta”, that game has no balance, and its devs aren't even trying to reach one
Only using the dominant strategy in this game is boring as hell.
its not moving the goal post, its testing your game knowledge, you say yourself the challenge comes from finding the best strategy, so wouldn't limiting certain towers each event actually spark that challenge? since then you gotta try to find what is your best option on the fly instead of just "well this always works so keep doing it every event"
“Yeah man I just wanna play the same 4 towers every game and never get bored of doing the exact same thing”
you're right, that's why the game is balanced to create a diverse set of situational options that require adapting to different conditions within the base game. if its such a big part of the game, then it wouldn't be very fun or challenging if you just ~~copied~~ found the single best strategy and never bothered again. they're not balanced with regards bosses or races, which is why they remove problematic towers to maintain a large pool of viable and competitive options to choose from.

if you can't win without monkeyopolis, then iunno; maybe you should work on finding the most optimal strategy with the options you're given or something like that.
So the Challenge is going to YouTube to see what the best strategy is?
    No - the challenge is to figure out what is the best strategy given the restrictions.
***IS*** there even a dominant strategy?
    Yes there's a meta dominant strategy for beating bosses and there are some people who seem to dislike any restrictions that disrupt that.
No its putting obstacles in the way, your strat usually only needs to be adapted and not completely altered, but you have several days to figure it out and thats the fun of it, especially if you have a friend to think things over with
The problem then would just be the lag
    Round 200+ is already unbearably laggy as is, might as well get some new frames to look at
to those saying "normal mode is easy you can use anything and still win."

I tried normal mode on a boss event with no restrictions, tried using my own strategy...

I didn't even get to tier 1
    Yeah, it‘s just people who base their entire life around the game and have lost all connection with reality and with how 99% of players play.
    I mean, you can pretty easily use your own strat as long as you recognise what’s important.

If you just put random things everywhere or try to play it like a normal game, you’re bound to lose, but barring elite, boss bloons are genuinely fine if you approach them properly.
    get good then lmao i seriously dont know what to tell you if you cannot beat tier 1 normal without meta abusing
Normal mode is already very easy(that’s the point of it) all of the complaints I have seen so far was that elite mode is hard because it has restrictions.
Normal mode is incredibly easy. I don’t think there has ever been a boss that was difficult on normal mode other than that week with Vortex on chutes.
    😂
Normal mode is incredibly trivial already. you can use just about any strategy and win easily in normal mode.
    Sure, Jan.
Man, shut up

Bruh if you dont like this boss than just skip it and go for a walk or something
    You have done nothing but prove my point.
        Someone sounds like they don’t get pleasured
        No. no they didnt.
        Whatever you say
Get good at the game. They’re supposed to be hard. Go play logs easy a few times if you wanna use your dominant strategy all the time.
    I think just because their intended to be hard does not mean there shouldn't be a "easy" mode that allows almost anyone to accomplish it

It does not harm anyone in anyone by having a easier mode
You are Literally unskilled 👍🏻
Wah wah wahhhh
Im not at all, its just not the end of the world. Watch a guide or dont participate if you dont want to. Nobody is forcing you to play it.
    The problem is that people can't do it without a guide, even it normal mode sometimes, despite wanting to play it. There's no fun in doing it but following someone else's instructions for a lot of people.
        Then learn some strategies or something its no different than chimps on hard maps.
            Bro really just said get good 💀
                -They allowed all 5 paragons without restriction

-There's enough room for 5 boats easily which can get a semi decent boat farm.

-You can use Geraldo for a little extra cash and utility powers lych can't steal.  
Not to mention 20 snipers you can combo with Geraldo's ability potion for great farming late game on top of the other stuff. 


Pick any paragon or make a VSTG. The restrictions on this one are so light and you get a ton of map space. I played this one like garbage and still beat it with a score under 15 minutes on ranked. 

The hardest part is knowing placements and order, but if that's giving you trouble, you probably do need a guide until you get the hang of it.
                    The point isn't that I can't beat it, or that this one is particularly hard, it's the repeated general restrictions.
            ok I get what you're trying to say but you chose a bad comparison, playing C.H.I.M.P.S in general is completely different than playing a boss event in many ways.
        [deleted]
            The problem is that it's just not fun for most. I can beat it, but that doesn't mean it's fun, because of the restrictions. The problem is worse for those who can't beat it.
                [deleted]
                    Have you read the post you're commenting under? This is far from the only post like it. Also, your way of playing strategy games doesn't apply to everyone. Some like to stick with what they know and like, rather than use things they don't know.
                        [deleted]
                            I can just as easily say your opinion is shitpost tier garbage. The elite bosses are meant to be challenging, but the normal ones are supposed to be accessible to everyone, which isn't the case with a lot of the restrictions. As has already been suggested, the restrictions should be in ranked mode only, meaning casual players don't suffer from the optimisations of tryhards.
        Who tf can’t even beat normal with a guide 💀
Wouldnt a sweat tell you that is that serious......
We should make this a subreddit inside joke

and with that a legend is born
But downvotes can
Oh yes what a great example (makes no sense btw)
It felt like no matter how much damage I did or how quickly I kill the husk it restores it’s health too fast
    Read up a bit on how lych works, when i say dont use buffs I mean active buffs (aka charge buffs) because lych is able to sap them (basically storing its hp and stunning the towers who had buffs) so avoid using towers like alchemist, call to arms, homeland defense, perma charge, overclock etc, villages are fine outside of x4x and x5x
        Ah okay, I’ll do that then. Thank you for the help!
Hey, uh what about you shut up it’s easy mode stop complaining
You rather lesser skilled players just not be able to enjoy this part of the game?
Skill issue
Even for a normal player, a max of 20 sniper shouldn't be an issue. They might be more space efficient than farms, but that's it, farms are better 80% of the time. Monkeyoppolis, isn't even that good anymore, and is far from necesary. And permaspike is only use in ranked(which is done by the better half of players), or to clean up missed bloons, wich there are also otter opsions for. This event is infact one of the easier ones over the last couple of months. And if you still can't beat it, I'm sorry, but then this is not yet build for you.
    Agreed 90% except for the hero restrictions too; some people just want to chill and use Ben
        Forgot about that part. I agree
            100% now!
    [deleted]
        Stickybomb is also great, fauto isn't realy necesary
    Exactly. Ranked sucks and only less than 1% actually use it. Get rid of it. Ninja Kiwi isn't stupid, their a little more smart and only idiots.
        just don't play it if you dislike it?
        That doesn't make any sense, and I play literally every boss game as ranked, I never try to score a good time or something I just don't like powers and enjoy extra rewards
        why would you not play ranked, its literally free rewards even if you don't try for a good time and it doesn't change the game at all
Got to tier 3 on my own and kept dying, DDT were getting through but limited towers I know work against that boss. Annoying. Just wanted to try it myself
Sorry, without what?
    Without these "best towers". I really dislike using permaspike and xx5 village. With them banned boss is actually easier to perform.
And why is that?
I normally use tack zone… done xD
Isn't that the point though? I mean, you need expensive towers like the Legend of the Night or True Sun God never to beat the maps on any difficulty; those are more about strategy then raw power. The boss events provide a scenario to use those towers in a situation where they're actually needed.
    Yeah I understand. Bosses were designed with paragons in mind so we have them so expensive and strong for that reason. But imo feels like a waste having so many new towers effectively locked to be used only by veteran players in a very specific game mode.

We could maybe have a nerfed and cheaper to obtain version on "standard" game modes or something
        >We could maybe have a nerfed and cheaper to obtain version on "standard" game modes or something

Those are the T5 towers
    LOTN in bosses 😂
banning monkeypolis doesnt sound as bad with the nerf to it recently, but i kinda wonder how itll effect elite, if much at all. i guess ill only really see if theres posts about it or someone like isab makes a video because its a stand out boss event or something
    It's no big deal. I cleared elite earlier today and made a post about it. I had over 2 million leftover/unused for Tier 5.
        Cracked has so much empty space for farms too. I just filled the map with 024s and had more money than I needed.
            Yeah. The restricted opolis isn't really felt since we can just spam farms everywhere.
Eh I mean with the ‘opolis nerfed I don’t think it’s really going to be too much of a reliant upgrade anymore
Found the Ninja Kiwi employee!
Every event Seems to be restricted enought to be original and tricky but not too restricted to be boring. Every big restriction like paragon ban is balanced with a longer map or some diffrent shit. Since more paragons are coming out without restrictions every boss would just be a "farm like crazy and always go for the best paragons that other people calculated" situation.
That would be poggers
Would the leaderboard be have Cash/Tiers used instead of or alonside time? 'Cause that would be interesting
    Time attack boss event. Imagine sending all the boss tiers at once
        There can only be one boss bloon on the screen at once though so the second you send a second one out, you'd instantly lose
            Well, no. If there is more than 1 boss at once, you will just see the HP of the first one. The second one will work normally you just wont see his HP. NK could make it so if there are 2 boss bloons or more, the HP bar just scales so the second one can appear
> Not gonna lie, a no farms event would actually be hella fun. The first two tiers of boss are usually doable without any farms, and you could use alternate money methods like sniper and boat farming for the other tiers.

Have fun trying to play that shit on any Elite boss on any tier beyond 2. Spamming supply drop = fun?
Spice islands or lotus island would be hella fun without farms since ppl would boat or snpier farm. I wouldnt ban farms entirely but only leave 204 farms to Buff merchantmen and to have some good early game with marketplaces
    I'm just gonna try bosses without banana farms every week from now on
which path is monkeyopolis again?
    bottom path village
        thank you :)
I don’t think they’ll ever ban it, but banning any part just makes elite stupidly hard just because you don’t have money. This week banned all banana farms, the literal main part of farming
I remember a while ago when I basically had over 5 mil left over on elite every week. It’s finally nice to actually see some challenging bosses and switch up strategies
This is such an absurd take.

Why should they not be able to play bosses without restrictions if they want to? How does them being able to do that affect you at all?
    [deleted]
        That's not what you're saying. They're asking to have a version of bosses that they would enjoy, and you're saying "you don't deserve that, if you don't like bosses you should just not play them."

That's a dumb take, period. There's nothing fundamentally wrong with a version of bosses that doesn't have restrictions. Literally, there is absolutely no reason not to have that, and if it *were* added a bunch of people who currently don't play bosses because of the restrictions would have a new mode they'd enjoy.

Stop gatekeeping people's fun.
            [deleted]
                If you don't have a problem with a mode that doesn't have restrictions, don't say "why do you have to enjoy everything in the game? if you don't like bosses don't play them." Say "yeah, it would be cool if there was a mode that didn't have restrictions so people like you could enjoy bosses too."
                    yeah, it would be cool if there was a mode that didn't have restrictions and rewards

Here, do you like it?
"the best strategy most people use" is literally the meta dude

the fact a better strategy that no one uses can exist does not mean the best one that people use isn't meta
    “Meta” is what produces best results, not what most people use
        no it isn't lmfao

if a strat no one uses but hypothetically produces the best results exists but again, NOT A SINGLE PERSON USES IT EVER that is not the "meta strat"

literally by that logic you could never call anything meta because some hypothetical better thing could be out there that would be the real meta despite no one finding it yet.

this argument has reached my limit for arguing with stupid people on the internet for the day. bye.
    Meta literally stands for most effective tactic available what does that have to do with use rates
        That is a backronym that has never accurately represented what the majority of people mean when they say "Meta"/"metagame".
Feel free to link me evidence showing me Ninjakiwis' statement that bosses are only for the top2% of players like isab. The boss event on non-ranked should be fun for everyone, but it isnt.

I said that you said "nothing" because speedrunning had nothing to do with the differences between ranked and unranked, the differences, the ONLY difference that has an impact on gameplay is that ranked bans powers and instad, while unranked doesnt.
But hey- thats a good effective technique for arguing you've got there i'll give you credit. Steet away the conversation from what we're talking about to deflect the fact you dont have much to say.
>  you can just "not do the exploit."

but you literally can just not do the exploit, or you can be fine with doing the exploits and do them but then you wouldn't be someone getting a mod to fix them in the first place. it's not like anyone is forcing you to do these exploits or even a leaderboard that you need to compete on "force" you to use them.
    Why do the mods exist, and get downloaded highly, if you can just "not do it"?

Think for a bit outside of common sense, which you clearly do have and are arguing on behalf of. Somehow I made that sound like an insult.
        > Think for a bit outside of common sense, which you clearly do have and are arguing on behalf of. Somehow I made that sound like an insult.

unsure if this was sarcasm or not, but i'm going to assume it's not. i'd imagine it gets downloaded because people follow a thought process of "well if it's there i'm going to do it because it's the best way to do it, but if i download a mod to fix it then i won't be tempted by it anymore"
            Temptation, spot on yeah. Temptation gets many many people! It gets me too. Being forced out of temptation is a very cool thing in the end, because I like to struggle but my natural thought process while struggling is "ok how can I not"
Yea like druid farming 👍
Calm down master oogway 

I'd bet that without restrictions, even unranked normal would lose most of its players after a month
r/im14andthisisdeep
🤓
Skill issue?
Indeed  
Couldn't have said it better myself  
Heck immagine if they nerfed paragons just because they do good against bosses, when in reality some towers like Ninjas do better as separate tier 5's
why would you name the fallacy you're making in your argument?

the slippery slope is literally one of the most famous fallacies come on guys
Me when I can’t just put down dart paragon on r80 and afk on normal 😭😭😭
Yeah gee, I wonder why the videos that reach people outside of a games yt ecosystem always seem to be the "I'm gonna play X but with self imposed restriction Y" ones, it's almost as if they do better.
    It's almost as if banning yourself from using the meta makes it a challenge and thus entertaining.
lmao i love this
Yeah he says that like it's the ONLY good strat. It's also a heavier micro start - this is a great one for idle since you can squeeze 5 boats and a ton of bottom path farms since there's no monkeyopolis. Then just ninja paragon and win. Only hard part is going for a faster score on ranked
> games that have frequent balance updates are bad games

These are actually bad. If “balance” updates are done mostly to “shake the meta”, that game has no balance, and its devs aren't even trying to reach one
No - the challenge is to figure out what is the best strategy given the restrictions.
Yes there's a meta dominant strategy for beating bosses and there are some people who seem to dislike any restrictions that disrupt that.
Round 200+ is already unbearably laggy as is, might as well get some new frames to look at
Yeah, it‘s just people who base their entire life around the game and have lost all connection with reality and with how 99% of players play.
I mean, you can pretty easily use your own strat as long as you recognise what’s important.

If you just put random things everywhere or try to play it like a normal game, you’re bound to lose, but barring elite, boss bloons are genuinely fine if you approach them properly.
get good then lmao i seriously dont know what to tell you if you cannot beat tier 1 normal without meta abusing
😂
Sure, Jan.
Nice avatar bro
    Ehh I like yours too!

Lmao.
You have done nothing but prove my point.
    Someone sounds like they don’t get pleasured
    No. no they didnt.
    Whatever you say
I think just because their intended to be hard does not mean there shouldn't be a "easy" mode that allows almost anyone to accomplish it

It does not harm anyone in anyone by having a easier mode
The problem is that people can't do it without a guide, even it normal mode sometimes, despite wanting to play it. There's no fun in doing it but following someone else's instructions for a lot of people.
    Then learn some strategies or something its no different than chimps on hard maps.
        Bro really just said get good 💀
            -They allowed all 5 paragons without restriction

-There's enough room for 5 boats easily which can get a semi decent boat farm.

-You can use Geraldo for a little extra cash and utility powers lych can't steal.  
Not to mention 20 snipers you can combo with Geraldo's ability potion for great farming late game on top of the other stuff. 


Pick any paragon or make a VSTG. The restrictions on this one are so light and you get a ton of map space. I played this one like garbage and still beat it with a score under 15 minutes on ranked. 

The hardest part is knowing placements and order, but if that's giving you trouble, you probably do need a guide until you get the hang of it.
                The point isn't that I can't beat it, or that this one is particularly hard, it's the repeated general restrictions.
        ok I get what you're trying to say but you chose a bad comparison, playing C.H.I.M.P.S in general is completely different than playing a boss event in many ways.
    [deleted]
        The problem is that it's just not fun for most. I can beat it, but that doesn't mean it's fun, because of the restrictions. The problem is worse for those who can't beat it.
            [deleted]
                Have you read the post you're commenting under? This is far from the only post like it. Also, your way of playing strategy games doesn't apply to everyone. Some like to stick with what they know and like, rather than use things they don't know.
                    [deleted]
                        I can just as easily say your opinion is shitpost tier garbage. The elite bosses are meant to be challenging, but the normal ones are supposed to be accessible to everyone, which isn't the case with a lot of the restrictions. As has already been suggested, the restrictions should be in ranked mode only, meaning casual players don't suffer from the optimisations of tryhards.
    Who tf can’t even beat normal with a guide 💀
Yes please

Hell yeah
Read up a bit on how lych works, when i say dont use buffs I mean active buffs (aka charge buffs) because lych is able to sap them (basically storing its hp and stunning the towers who had buffs) so avoid using towers like alchemist, call to arms, homeland defense, perma charge, overclock etc, villages are fine outside of x4x and x5x
    Ah okay, I’ll do that then. Thank you for the help!
Agreed 90% except for the hero restrictions too; some people just want to chill and use Ben
    Forgot about that part. I agree
        100% now!
[deleted]
    Stickybomb is also great, fauto isn't realy necesary
Exactly. Ranked sucks and only less than 1% actually use it. Get rid of it. Ninja Kiwi isn't stupid, their a little more smart and only idiots.
    just don't play it if you dislike it?
    That doesn't make any sense, and I play literally every boss game as ranked, I never try to score a good time or something I just don't like powers and enjoy extra rewards
    why would you not play ranked, its literally free rewards even if you don't try for a good time and it doesn't change the game at all
Without these "best towers". I really dislike using permaspike and xx5 village. With them banned boss is actually easier to perform.
Yeah I understand. Bosses were designed with paragons in mind so we have them so expensive and strong for that reason. But imo feels like a waste having so many new towers effectively locked to be used only by veteran players in a very specific game mode.

We could maybe have a nerfed and cheaper to obtain version on "standard" game modes or something
    >We could maybe have a nerfed and cheaper to obtain version on "standard" game modes or something

Those are the T5 towers
LOTN in bosses 😂
It's no big deal. I cleared elite earlier today and made a post about it. I had over 2 million leftover/unused for Tier 5.
    Cracked has so much empty space for farms too. I just filled the map with 024s and had more money than I needed.
        Yeah. The restricted opolis isn't really felt since we can just spam farms everywhere.
Time attack boss event. Imagine sending all the boss tiers at once
    There can only be one boss bloon on the screen at once though so the second you send a second one out, you'd instantly lose
        Well, no. If there is more than 1 boss at once, you will just see the HP of the first one. The second one will work normally you just wont see his HP. NK could make it so if there are 2 boss bloons or more, the HP bar just scales so the second one can appear
I'm just gonna try bosses without banana farms every week from now on
bottom path village
    thank you :)
[deleted]
    That's not what you're saying. They're asking to have a version of bosses that they would enjoy, and you're saying "you don't deserve that, if you don't like bosses you should just not play them."

That's a dumb take, period. There's nothing fundamentally wrong with a version of bosses that doesn't have restrictions. Literally, there is absolutely no reason not to have that, and if it *were* added a bunch of people who currently don't play bosses because of the restrictions would have a new mode they'd enjoy.

Stop gatekeeping people's fun.
        [deleted]
            If you don't have a problem with a mode that doesn't have restrictions, don't say "why do you have to enjoy everything in the game? if you don't like bosses don't play them." Say "yeah, it would be cool if there was a mode that didn't have restrictions so people like you could enjoy bosses too."
                yeah, it would be cool if there was a mode that didn't have restrictions and rewards

Here, do you like it?
“Meta” is what produces best results, not what most people use
    no it isn't lmfao

if a strat no one uses but hypothetically produces the best results exists but again, NOT A SINGLE PERSON USES IT EVER that is not the "meta strat"

literally by that logic you could never call anything meta because some hypothetical better thing could be out there that would be the real meta despite no one finding it yet.

this argument has reached my limit for arguing with stupid people on the internet for the day. bye.
Meta literally stands for most effective tactic available what does that have to do with use rates
    That is a backronym that has never accurately represented what the majority of people mean when they say "Meta"/"metagame".
Another guy said 

This is lifted from v27 patch notes (when they introduced Boss events):

Difficulty Fair Warning - Bosses are designed to be crazy challenging! If you are new to BTD6, make sure you can win most hard modes and really know how to farm well and maximize tower damage before you take on a Boss. Expect defeat. Nay, revel in it - bathe in anguish then emerge smarter, more capable, and with improved tactics that help you get further each time. If you have built up a stockpile of Powers and Insta Monkeys, feel free to use them - they are not required but they are certainly fair game. And, yes, build those Paragons...

Boss events are not meant to be simple. The restrictions are meant to keep things spicy and tricky each week.. Otherwise, it'll get boring real fast if the map is the only thing that's changing every week..
    Owned
    Thanks for this. So NK just doesn't understand what fun is, "crazy challening" my ass. Nk are fooling themselves if they dont think half the people completing the hard weeks of boss events weren't using a youtube guide.
        Odyssey is for causal players like you but bosses are meant for pro’s
            The patch notes said it was "crazy challenging" but it didnt say you had to be pro-level like Isab. And i aint a casual kid.
                Lmao you don’t need to be Isab to know how to play
                    Glad we both agree on a point i didnt make.
                lmao you dont need to be isab level, if you have a decent understanding of how to beat chimps on intermediate to advanced maps you should be about ready to handle bosses
                    Then why are you arguing with me, and not the person directly above my comment who said, QUOTE for QUOTE "bosses are meant for pros"?
    > Difficulty Fair Warning - Bosses are designed to be crazy challenging! If you are new to BTD6, make sure you can win most hard modes and really know how to farm well and maximize tower damage before you take on a Boss. 

We do, NK; and then you fucking ban it.
Literally the patch notes, check out the second-top comment on this post.
    Answer me this then: if bosses are only for "pros"  why is there even a difference between ranked and unranked? After all, pros dont need to use powers or insta-monkeys!
        Because they appeal to two different types of players? Ranked is for speedrunners. Not all pros are speedrunners. Also, MONKE FARMER
            Lmao you said nothing. Speedrunning has nothing to do with the mode's difficulty. For thd targeted demographic of the boss event, pros or people who like crazy challenges, ranked and unranked have 0 differences.
                These are not “crazy challenges”. Even if you’re just decently ok at the game you should be able to beat most boss weeks.
                    I am just quoting the patch notes that were provided to me my guy. Bring that up to Ninjakiwi.
                Dude. Are you seriously saying Speed running has ZERO differences compared to the normal boss? 

If that's the case then why are races hard? And why are races in contested territory?

            I am just quoting the patch notes that were provided to me my guy. Bring that up to Ninjakiwi.
        Dude. Are you seriously saying Speed running has ZERO differences compared to the normal boss? 

If that's the case then why are races hard? And why are races in contested territory?
            ...Are you being stupid on purpose?
I said that you said "nothing" because speedrunning had nothing to do with the differences between ranked and unranked, the differences, the ONLY difference that has an impact on gameplay is that ranked bans powers and instad, while unranked doesnt.
But hey- thats a good effective technique for arguing you've got there i'll give you credit. Steet away the conversation from what we're talking about to deflect the fact you dont have much to say.
Temptation, spot on yeah. Temptation gets many many people! It gets me too. Being forced out of temptation is a very cool thing in the end, because I like to struggle but my natural thought process while struggling is "ok how can I not"
-They allowed all 5 paragons without restriction

-There's enough room for 5 boats easily which can get a semi decent boat farm.

-You can use Geraldo for a little extra cash and utility powers lych can't steal.  
Not to mention 20 snipers you can combo with Geraldo's ability potion for great farming late game on top of the other stuff. 


Pick any paragon or make a VSTG. The restrictions on this one are so light and you get a ton of map space. I played this one like garbage and still beat it with a score under 15 minutes on ranked. 

The hardest part is knowing placements and order, but if that's giving you trouble, you probably do need a guide until you get the hang of it.
    The point isn't that I can't beat it, or that this one is particularly hard, it's the repeated general restrictions.

    Have you read the post you're commenting under? This is far from the only post like it. Also, your way of playing strategy games doesn't apply to everyone. Some like to stick with what they know and like, rather than use things they don't know.

            I can just as easily say your opinion is shitpost tier garbage. The elite bosses are meant to be challenging, but the normal ones are supposed to be accessible to everyone, which isn't the case with a lot of the restrictions. As has already been suggested, the restrictions should be in ranked mode only, meaning casual players don't suffer from the optimisations of tryhards.
Try to listen to this insect. A bee sounds like a fruit fly as disguise, it can actually hurt you.
If you don't have a problem with a mode that doesn't have restrictions, don't say "why do you have to enjoy everything in the game? if you don't like bosses don't play them." Say "yeah, it would be cool if there was a mode that didn't have restrictions so people like you could enjoy bosses too."
    yeah, it would be cool if there was a mode that didn't have restrictions and rewards

Here, do you like it?
The patch notes said it was "crazy challenging" but it didnt say you had to be pro-level like Isab. And i aint a casual kid.
    Lmao you don’t need to be Isab to know how to play
        Glad we both agree on a point i didnt make.
    lmao you dont need to be isab level, if you have a decent understanding of how to beat chimps on intermediate to advanced maps you should be about ready to handle bosses
        Then why are you arguing with me, and not the person directly above my comment who said, QUOTE for QUOTE "bosses are meant for pros"?
