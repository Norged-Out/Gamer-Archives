[[Team Aqua is a lot dumber than Team Magma]]


Something that bothers me in Gen III is that we are meant to consider Aqua and Magma as equals. They are both groups with a legitimate environmental cause who become thugs in pursuit of that goal and doom the world with their arrogance.

Maxie's point makes some sense, at least until you think about any of the practical issues at all. The habitats of land pokemon are under threat. Lower the sea levels and you can have more land for nature to move into. In practice Magma is going to destroy a lot of habitats and probably do a better job of flooding the land than Aqua did because the plan is literally just global warming. Humans would just build more towns and cities on the land if there was more of it. But Maxie is right that more land *would* mean more habitats for pokemon.

&#x200B;

But Aqua's plans wouldn't even give the fish more of what they need if they did raise sea levels. Real marine ecologists are concerned about overfishing and pollution, not that there **isn't enough ocean**. Oceans are mostly empty as you get further from the land because all the food is closer to the coast. The plankton eat the detritus that is around the land and in shallow waters, the fish eat the plankton. Further from the shore, oceans are mostly empty. Presumably its similar for most pokemon.

When sea levels rise, it will reduce the perimeter of land masses, and there will be fewer good habitats for fishes. The water above a ruined, polluting city that is now near a newly coastal city is probably not better than the old habitat.


Isn't there a meme where Maxie is using a chalkboard explaining how through the use of science, they will harness the power of Groudon to create more ground...

And then there's Archie and his "you see this fish? Imma wrestle it"

        Keeogri
            Back when Kyogre and Groudons first began on Pokémon go, many of the community I’m in called them, “groodun,” and, “keeogri.”
                Keeogri I can almost get, but had the people saying groodun never heard the word ground? He's literally a ground type and the name is just ground without the n
                    It’s like the ramen shop I work at… “Rayman” doesn’t bother me much, at least the letters are all there. But the other day we had someone calling them “Romain” noodles and I wanted to scream ;o;
                        When you only have one noodle it's a raman bowl
                    Yeah I kept telling people he’s not a disgraced football coach he’s a god damn land beast!
                        The emails Groudon sent to the pokemon league might change your mind idk
                    From my experience, this is the time when most kids learned what croutons were, and they probably associated the spelling with that lol. Also, why didn’t they just go with Groundon?
                        Why didn't they just call Kyogre Groundoff?
                            Why isn’t Rayquaza Flyogre???
                        Yeah they were like 40+ lol
                    It might be a reference to one of the Pokemon raps, which mispronounced both of them in those ways
                I called it Kroger
                    I have 2 named Kyle and Kroger lmao
                Ruby and Sapphire came out when I was in like the third grade and I definitely thought it was groodun
        The fact that's he's winning 💀
        “At least you get a dad in this one” lol good point
        I had not, thank you for starting my day!
        Isn't this just the plot of Avatar?
        This is sublime.
    There's also this [comic](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/sonic/images/5/5f/4ed.png/revision/latest?cb=20150105155248) that sums up Archie pretty well.
        Reminds me of [this Maxie comic, my dude.](https://pin.it/4jR9aOy)
            Super Beard Bros are playing Ocarina of Time named My Dude and it kills me every time. Definitely have to do that sometime soon in a similar game.
        Absolutely hilarious, thanks for that
    Came here to reference that
        Fun fact, that's how I decided to get Alpha Sapphire instead of Omega Ruby
            Based. I got omega ruby for Christmas, but was always a kyogre guy. You bet your ass I traded my groudon for a kyogre as soon as I could!
            Pirates are also way cooler, my 7,8/10 too much water monotyoe nuzlocke would have been too easy in OR and goddamn shirtless Hunk villains...
            Objectively correct decision since 2003.
                Also helps AS has imo one of the coolest easter eggs in the series. Revealing in the hideout that in the past Archie and his admins befriended a Jirachi, something OR has no counter Easter egg for, just something specific to those 3. Even Cooler was recently in Pokemon Masters them using the small Easter Egg as a bit of a focal point for an event.
                    >Revealing in the hideout that in the past Archie and his admins befriended a Jirachi

Where was that revealed? I honestly don't remember.
                        It is in Shelly's room I believe. She has a picture of them together
                Counter point: ORAS Courtney is HOT
                    This logic is irrefutable
                    Counter-counter point: Alpha Sapphire Shelly.
                Sapphire superiority has been a mental illness for 20 years my god 😔
                    Sorry I can't hear you over the sound of KYOGRE SHOOTING GROUDON IN THE FACE WITH HYDRO PUMP
                        And then Primal Groudon's Desolate Land immediately evaporates that water and it does no damage
                            Retconned in 2019 😊
                                And yet Episode Delta acknowledged that the retcon and the original universe coexist. In one timeline, Primal Groudon wins, and in the other, Kyogre uses hydro pump with Drizzle and wins immediately. In yet another, Rayquaza makes them both stop that.
                    If by mental ilness you mean incontrovertible truth, yes. ✋️
    Yeah, I saw it too.
    Oh god, hidden memory right there.  I used Archie’s face from that panel as a profile picture on Steam for a while.
Both of their plans are stupid when you think about them for a little bit.

Maxie thinks "land = where humans develop / fight over land, so more land = faster development and no more territory conflict".

While Archie thinks "water = source of all life / humanity is damaging it, so more water = bigger source of life and somehow restoring nature".

They're both ridiculously surface level ways of thinking, though I will say it is pretty fitting for these two of all villains to be like that.

EDIT: Fixed grammar.
    At least Team Aqua is upfront about being a bunch of dumbasses, while Team Magma acts like they are highly intellegent scientists and then come up with this dumb plan.
        I think that presentation is only in the remakes. If I'm remembering correctly, they act pretty much the same as each other in the original releases
            In the original the team leaders fulfilled their respective stereotypes. In the remakes the teams became more of a reflection of these stereotypes with the team admins especially being given more 'depth'. They definitely made the stereotypes more extreme in the remakes.
            I just replayed Emerald. Archie isn't really presented as an idiot, but he's not presented as pretending to be smart. He's just a thug that leads a group of thugs. Maxie is presented as trying to be a smart guy though.
            Granted I played Ruby, but I did a gen 3 play through and both teams were pretty basic “I love land/water and hate the other team”
        Not necessarily. It's more Maxie tries to be the smartest person in the room despite how much of a dumbass he is, as opposed to Archie who doesn't always pretend to know what's going on.
        it is true though. most of the ocean is a lifeless bowl of water, if they just used groudon to make some extra landmasses out in the middle of the ocean(and maybe raised up a portion of the ocean in a ring of mountains to counteract the displacement) both teams would be satisfied. in fact paiso probably did more to advance both teams agendas than they ever will.
    Ironically, this is the exact same gen that has entire city floating on the ocean lol
    [deleted]
        I like how in the movie Lugia was created as the primal deity of the sea, but in the games it just lives in acave because its home burned down.
    There's actually a fun story about how the idea for them came to be!

Tokyo, where Game Freak is located, is an extremely dense city with very little room to expand in most directions.  The only way to get more space would be to build out into the ocean in some way.  During Gen 3's development this was quite the hot topic, people talking about the extra space for building or the impact on the ecosystem and all that fun stuff, and Game Freak decided it'd be fun to blow up those arguments to ridiculous proportions and imagine cults of people fiercely at war about whether there should be *more* land *everywhere* or more *ocean* everywhere.

And it just goes to show, your villains don't have to make sense to be enjoyable.  The plot's dumb, but the insanity of their plans lends them a certain charisma anyways that gets us talking and laughing about it even years later.

    Thanks, I needed that one
    To this day that’s still the only pokemon meme my parents understood lmao
        They definitely need to be informed about Ferrothorn's homophobia
            Why is Ferrothorn homophobic? :O

                    Ohhhhh. Thank you. :>
I'm pretty sure Archie's plans were not for the benefits of humanity, his goal was to remove the problem (humans the main cause of the ocean's pollution). By raising the oceans, the amount of humans and their ability to pollute the waters would be greatly diminished, sure there would be a lot of damage at first but in the long run, with lower human presence marine life would end up benefitting.
    Honestly their plans were both more nonsensical than Lance and Agatha's 'destroy cities until humans stop polluting' strategy in Adventures.

            >the main issue i have with plots like this in the pokemon world is the world never really seems to have these issues. the world is very solarpunk where people co exist with nature and animals, and they have a wider array of energy sources to the point that things like energy related corruption is a very hard premise to buy.

Yeah, the games have become more utopian while the real world is starting to really feel the effects. Its ridiculous that Rose was worried about energy that wouldn't run out for 2000 years, when oil could be gone in 50 and unaffordable for most people to fuel their cars much earlier than that.
            Idk, gen 1 was really about industry and science reigning over nature. In the yellow arc there were a lot of chapters about the effects of pollutions, like Yellow training in a desert, the Power Plant's wastes going into rivers, or Exeggutors and Oddishes migrating because their forests were no more. The solarpunk aesthetic came later.
            Well, corpses might be unhealthy to be around, but they shouldn’t be more polluting than naturally decomposing animals.
        I don't know about that. The Adventures Elite Four plot was absurdly stupid.
            I didn’t think it was that stupid, at least not for Lorelei and Lance. They both personally saw how humans had messed with the environment and were hurting Pokemon. So they felt that getting rid of humans would allow Pokemon to prosper. Never really got why Agatha joined, besides bitterness towards Oak. And Bruno didn’t care about the plans.
                True.  They were more fanatical and extreme than plain stupid, in my opinion.
                Lance was pretty much throwing a temper tantrum deciding because of a few bad experiences he's going to try and murder everyone, not considering how nigh impossible it would be even with his power and how much pollution and destruction it would cause by itself regardless. He wasn't planning on killing literally everyone either, so he was pretty much trying to enact Team Plasma's goal, only he deluded himself into thinking he was actually a savior instead of a villain or complete moron. Lorelei was sort of similar, except she was manipulated by Agatha, a bit too easily from what I recall as well.

Don't remember why exactly Agatha joined either. I think she felt the same, but her hatred of Oak was focused on more. Really wonder why Bruno was even with them in the first place instead of generically wandering the world looking for strong opponents.
                    For some reason I didn’t see your reply until way later. I do think that their plot was excessive, I at least felt it made sense contextually. I guess it depends on what you meant by stupid. I think they just invited Bruno to join them. He does care about the environment of Pokemon, as seen during the Red/Bruno flashback. So maybe that helped. I think Lorelei was a child when Agatha recruited her, so Lorelei being manipulated easily didn’t bother me too much.
                        I guess Bruno is like Agatha then if there was a flashback that showed him caring. I mostly only recall him wanting to fight strong opponents and had to be controlled to actually do anything for the plan.

That's not exactly what I meant by Lorelei being easily convinced. It's more the pace of the flashback was way too fast.
                            Yeah, Bruno didn't really seem to care about the plan, I think he said as much. It ended up making his inclusion in the Johto E4 feel a lot more natural though.

Also yeah, I guess they really didn't want to spend too much time on the backstories of the villains. Even Lance got a couple scenes at most.
                Bruno was mind controlled no?
                    He joined them of his own volition I believe, but all of his worst acts were done when he was mind controlled.
            They were the fusion of team plasma and flare.
        I need to read that it sounds wild
            Pokemon Adventures (AKA Pokemon Special) had a way more exciting narrative than any of the anime adaptations, and most of the games. The Yellow saga was probably the best of it. At least through Gen III, I haven't read Diamond and Pearl.
        Lance and Agatha should join Team Flare then, they'd get along.
    Yes and no, depends on the game. In Sapphire their plan was simply to just Add More Ocean because they felt that would be an ideal world to live in. In Alpha Sapphire it was expanded upon to be what you said. Wipe out humanity and technology with a great flood so that pokemon as a whole (not just marine ones) can thrive again.

ORAS Magma vs Aqua can basically be boiled down to "I want humanity to thrive, screw pokemon" vs "I want pokemon to thrive, screw humanity" instead of "more land vs more sea" in the originals.
        Aqua wasn't a bunch of goofballs in the originals either.  Although they did seem to have a major lack of understanding about the water cycle.
            This is the thing I miss about the original Team Magma and Aqua. They both feel like mafias (just look at OG Archie and Maxie's appearances). They might be dumb, but they're scary. The redesigns make Maxie too nerdy and Archie too goofy.

Well, at least I got redesigned Courtney out of it, so I guess that's a silver lining.
                At least now they feel like dofferent characters. Back then they were literal clones.
                We also got redesigned Tabitha, so we're still at a net loss on Magma.
But we also got Matt and Shelly, so +1 on Aqua.
                they totally dyslexia'd on shelly tho, and that was a fuckin tragedy.
                    Remake shelly goes hard imo
            I think they just wanted more water in existence, and water pokemon can create water from… well, not H or O particles.  And the Pokémon that can create the most water is Kyogre using it’s perpetual rain cloud summoning ability.
    it would not, we have a delicate ecosystem that anamolies like that would create a ton of imbalance. certain sea creatures rely the water to be a certain pressure, fresh and salt water creatures would be displaced, pretty much the reasons why scientists say the biblical flood wouldnt happen are the rammifications of what team aqua would have caused. 

&#x200B;

sea creatures that give birth on land would be in jeopardy, loss of coastal habits would mess up feeding and breeding grounds, coral reefs are very sensitive to sea level rising, which would be detrimental to creatures that rely on coral for food and shelter. nutrient runoff can cause algae to over grow and cause oxygen levels to drop leading to more death. 

&#x200B;

the chain reactions of these events would not even help the ocean creatures. so i'd say both their plans are 50/50 as dumb as each others.
ORAS fixes both in complete opposite and hilarious ways

Team Magma were made into scientists, and thus their plan to revive Groudon was reworked into something that made theoretical sense. This only works because, as you pointed out, the idea of expanding the land at least kinda had a grain of logic

Team Aqua were made into pirates. Their plan was utterly stupid from the outset, but the remake reworked Archie and the others to be emotionally driven and **not care** that their plan doesn’t make sense because they’re doing it anyway. Only Shelly seemed to have any brains in the gang

Tldr: ORAS made Maxie’s smart to justify his plan’s effectiveness, and made Archie **too stupid to care that his plan is dumb**
I played Ruby when I was younger and Ruby and Sapphire do this thing where the alternate version team shows up as the moral vigilante heroes. So for a long time I saw Archie as a good guy. It was really weird to play Sapphire and Emerald after that lol.
Both started the apocalypse to achieve their goals. Everything was screwed sideways from both if they fully succeeded.
    In fairness they weren't trying to start the apocalypse. Their math was just off.

I don't think they considered it possible for either Pokémon to be as powerful as they were.
        Yeah, it's not like there were historical notes about someone else riviving Hoenn's legendaries in the past and bringing the apocalypse.

They'd have been really stupid to do it in that case.
Other than N's plasma does any villian team make sense
    I guess Giovanni is just standard mafia stuff with pokemon. There's also a theory that he had a reasonable plan to fight Mewtwo, by gathering ghost types with the silph scope, and getting the Master Ball.
        His plan was smaller scale anyways.  He didn't want to reshape the globe with dramatic legendaries and mythological giants - he just wanted to rule the criminal underworld and oppose any resistance against him.
            team rainbow rocket giovanni: say that again punk i dare ya
                Oh yeah.  I forgot about the true boss of bosses.
        >  by gathering ghost types with the silph scope, and getting the Master Ball.

Interesting, never heard of it before.
            It's not even that much of a stretch. Silph Co designed both, Rocket invaded Silph Co, and maybe it was only in FRLG but I thought they specifically mentioned Rocket wanting the Master Ball.
    Team Rocket doesn't do plans. They see something they want, they use force to take it.

In Team Galactic, Cyrus is the only one who knows he plans to destroy reality and remake it in his image. Everyone else just does what they're told and trusts Cyrus that it will make things better.

Team Flare makes zero sense, because the kinds of people who would join Team Flare are the kinds of people who make the world "Ugly" as Lysander says. He'd be genociding the people who could be part of the solution while gathering people who would be part of the problem.

Team Skull doesn't do plans unless Lusamine is bossing them around.

Lusamine's actually insane and her goals are nonsensical in the first place, her plans to achieve them are even more so.

Team Yell's plan is absolutely idiotic. They want to ensure Marnie wins by harassing the competition, but if Rose wasn't busy trying to save the future they'd get Marnie disqualified and Spikmuth's gym shut down due to their interference.

Rose's plan is logically sound, but his goals are insane. Rose suffers from a messiah complex and it shows.
        Lusamines plan in SM is literally just to go to Ultra Space with her Jellyfish mommy. So her plan full on works. It is canonically inspired by a bout of alien induced insanity, but the plan is sound. In USUM, her plan isn’t terrible, she’s just woefully unprepared and to be honest, I can understand why she’d consider herself a better candidate than a teenager to fight Necrozma.

As for Rose, I don’t see why he didn’t just wait like one day. His plan is fine because he’s under the assumption he can control and harness Eternatus, but that’s not even the source of conflict really. Leon was mainly mad that a fucking sports tournament would be interrupted so I don’t particularly get why either the tournament could be postponed a day or why Rose couldn’t wait one day??
            >As for Rose, I don’t see why he didn’t just wait like one day

Because the player was the first trainer in years who had a shot at beating Leon, and his plan falls apart if Leon stops being champion.

Rose needs Leon to catch Eternatus, and use Eternatus in official battles in order to collect energy from them.

If Leon retires from training after losing his champion status or decides he's not qualified to help, Rose's plan is shot.

He needed Leon to be the one to catch Eternatus, and once Leon had Eternatus it would be a staple of his team and Leon would genuinely become unbeatable, ensuring Leon would remain champion for the rest of his life, and Eternatus would keep supplying Galar with infinite energy.
    They all make sense in theory, the problem is all of them are dumbasses.
    Alolan plan made decent sense, at least in Sun and Moon.  USUM also made sense but like, they were woefully unprepared for the missions.  Like at least make sure you have your UB Killing Machines under control(Silvally) and actually functioning before you enact your plan.
Pokémon fans: "Don't you think Hoenn has enough water?"

Archie: "Which one of ya'll pale motherfuckers just said that?!"
You should watch [Tama's video on Ruby and Sapphire](https://youtu.be/Ze8uhmeFt7A); it blew my mind! If you think of Japan as the island nation that it is, your land space is limited for developing housing. The Japanese government has been "reclaiming" land once below the sea and using it for human development. Reclaiming land comes at the cost of destroying the established marine ecosystem; it also removes a major food and income source for people who used the wetlands. In reality, team magma is the government taking wetland and destroying it for human use who need dry land. Team aqua is the environmentalist, farmers, and other people who depend upon the wetlands and don't believe in the destruction of their biodiversity. Land reclamation has been a big part of Japan since world war 2, so one could argue that team aqua is advocating to restore the wetlands from the reclaimed land. Considering reddit is predominantly used by Americans, it would make sense why land reclamation isn't a forethought on our minds since the US has so much unoccupied, but usable, land. Also, "expand the ocean!" and "expand the land!" are easy, benign ways to make the topic appealing to kids without politicizing it extensively. These topics were prevalent to the devs and they wanted to inform youth in this passion project.
    One of my favourite YouTube vids, loved the background.

Shame they didn't execute the concept throughout the games. Hoenn is depicted as a utopia where people, Pokemon and the land are already living in harmony - so both teams seem insane. If these issues around conservation v development were shown in game it would have made heaps more sense.
I think they're both equally stupid and didn't consider the real life implections.
    Tbf, I think that can be said for almost any evil villain mega-plot ever
        I mean Lysandre did consider that a lot of both People and Pokemon would die, but felt it was necessary.
            In reality that's just an excuse, Lysander hated people from the start for being elitists despite being elitists himself.
                Kinda refreshing to have a villain that just goes "Fuck it, killing everyone".
                    I would have agreed to that but team flare overall is a special kind of stupid so that makes it a moot point.
                        X/Y really needed that third game.
                            Sadly I don't think a third game can fix that mess with out a complete overhaul to x and y's story.
    The OG Nuzlocke comic springs to mind immediately. "What do you mean 'It's really hot and everyone is dying'? I don't understand... How can water be *good*?"
One is not better than the other. They're both apocalyptically stupid ideas of equal merit.
I've always liked Shaymay's argument for why Team Aqua's story makes more sense than Magma's in ORAS.

Basically, his argument is based around the meaning of the game's titles, Alpha and Omega. Or the beginning and the end. In Alpha Sapphire, Archie wants to use Kyogre to bring new beginnings to the world, but he fails to realize that in order for the world to start over, it needs to come to an end first, and the gravity of what exactly that means only falls on him when it's too late. It's definitely a "no duh" moment, but it's a kid's game, it doesn't need to be that deep.

Meanwhile, Maxie says he wants to bring an end to the world (exact wording in the English script is "I will use the Red Orb to awaken Groudon, revert it to its primal form, and put an end to all else!"). Then Tabitha runs in and tells Maxie to stop because he's gonna end the world. Maxie then awakens Groudon anyway and then freaks out because he realized the world is ending.

When you look at it this way, one of these characters is a bit more misguided than the other. Obviously both plans are dumb as hell though
    Tabitha: "No, Maxie, don't do it! If you use that, the world is gonna end!"

Maxie: *pushes button anyway* ".... yo yo yo WAIT! What's going on, what does it start a damn apocalypse now?!"

Tabitha: "I just fricking told you it's gonna end the world!"

Maxie: "I thought you said 'the world is gonna blend'!"

Tabitha: "WHY THE HELL WOULD I SAY THAT?!"

Maxie: "I DON'T KNOW, OK? IT SOUNDED SO DUMB, THAT'S WHY I IGNORED IT IN THE FIRST PLACE!"
To also add to the Aqua slander. If you want to supply actual science to the games, Kyogre the legendary Pokemon of rain would just take water from the ocean to create the rain they think is going to fill up the ocean.
    Pokemon that can use water type moves can use surf in the middle of a desert which summons a giant wave to crash into the opponent. Even tiny Pokemon. I'm pretty sure it safe to assume they can magic up water out of nowhere. The better question is how isn't the world already flooded using the game logic.
        Because it's balanced by having grass types to absorb the water, and fire types with ridiculous body temperatures to evaporate excess.

I'm looking at you, *Magcargo*.
            I'm pretty sure the evaporation from fire types would just add to the water cycle instead of eliminating it but I didn't think of grass types. That's a pretty good balance to the creation of water. I think we solved this mystery.
        Well you see, all of the Vaporeons, Poliwags, Quagsires and other Pokemon with Water Absorb are absorbing all of this excess water created by Surf, Hydro Pump and other Water moves.

It's all balanced!
            Damn you're right. I definitely failed Pokemon biology.
        its conjured water, not real. it has all the properties of water but ceases to exist once the pokemon stops focusing on it.

alternatively, water pokemon have alot more water in their bodies than their size would suggest, and they hide its weight the same way that pokeballs do.
yeah but team aqua has them beat in the sexy beast category, so it all balances out.
You put a lot more thought into it than Gamefreak did back then.

Seriously. RBY and GSC both just had Team Rocket with their "do bad things because somehow money" excuse for fighting the player and causing trouble. Gen 3 switching to environmental terrorism and building villains that at least sort of had a point (without being too complex since they were still aimed at kids) was a big step up in writing quality.
The Great Barrier Reef, which is a pretty good place for biodiversity and the like, only exists because of rising sea levels. Perhaps this is what Aqua wants to create more of.
    Source?  Isn't the reef dying from rising sea temps?
        You seem to have misunderstood my comment. 10,000 years ago, the GBR did not exist; what is now the Reef was still dry land. Some time within the last 10,000 years, rising sea levels caused the land to be flooded. Around the Reef is a series of Islands, which are the tips of mountains from before the flood. This created an area of ocean which was mostly protected by strong ocean currents, which facilitated the formation of the Reef. Thus, it was rising sea levels that allowed the Reef to form.
            so someone should use (a)groudon to raise a hundred or so pillars out of the bottom of the ocean and have them stop like twenty or so feet under the surface
        The reef is actually dying from carbon dioxide concentration. Basically all the CO2 dissolves into the water, which changes the acidity and dissolves the outer layer of the reefs (causing the bleaching).

I think a big issue with environmentalist concerns is that a lot of complex issues are boiled down to “global warming.” Of course climate change is a big issue, but a lot of environmental issues are caused by a variety of chemicals. Fertilizer, insecticides, CO2, etc all cause major problems in different ways (and can usually cause multiple problems each like CO2 causing warming and ocean acidification).
    That would make sense. Archie does mention making more habitats for water Pokemon, and reefs have a tremendously diverse population in real life.
I agree that Maxie was more sensible than Archie. I don’t remember exactly how it played out in the anime, but it felt like Maxie realized why his and Archie’s plans were bad and tried to stop Archie towards the end of that story arc.
I was always bothered by the stupid reasons both of the teams have. So in my own headcanon I see Maxie wanting to control groudon in order to have it create more natural resources like iron, copper etc. since groudon probably has the ability to create these directly or as a byproduct of making landmass. Where as I imagine Archie controlling Kyogre to revitalise destroyed pokemon habitats and maybe further develop agriculture which would greatly benefit from on demand rain.
They're both brainless idiots, that one makes "more sense" than another is kind of irrelevant, like going from a 0.1 to a 0.2 out of 10.

Now Ghetsis tho? oooh boy, now that was some nefarious stuff! Totally nailed down the evil cultist leader vibe.

>Maxie's point makes some sense

[Careful …](https://youtu.be/cJs9wNOHEnk)
They liked Waterworld a whole lot and Team Magma...What are some pop culture film or show that Team Magma would really like?
    Team Magma saw Star Wars and was like, “I wanna live on Tatooine!”
        I was thinking film about land development but that's good too
            Are there any culturally relevant films about land development? I can’t think of any.
                [https://www.google.com/search?q=films+about+Land+development&oq=films+about+Land+development+&aqs=chrome..69i57.3591j0j7&client=ms-android-verizon&sourceid=chrome-mobile&ie=UTF-8](https://www.google.com/search?q=films+about+Land+development&oq=films+about+Land+development+&aqs=chrome..69i57.3591j0j7&client=ms-android-verizon&sourceid=chrome-mobile&ie=UTF-8) I've found some
                    I clicked the first link in that search & read through the list, and honestly I haven’t even seen most of them. The 2 I have seen the author specifically mentions aren’t actually related to land development.
                        Ah gotcha
    Lawrence of Arabia.
        Alrighty then
    Maxie read the Bible and want to become Moses maybe.
A lot dumber but also a lot hotter
    My decision making for choosing Team Aqua over Team Magma XD.

Shelly supremacy!
Aqua also spent a lot of time on their uniform planning only to end up just not wearing shirts
I think you're misinterpreting Aqua's goal.

> We are creating a world in which innocent Pokémon suffer as a result of our actions… And that is something that I can't forgive! That's why I came to a decision, see? The foolish actions of my fellow humans, the seas we have blighted, nature itself… I will return everything to its unspoiled beginnings!

Aqua's goal was to create a biblical flood to clear out everything humans were doing to the ocean and "return the world back to nature for the good of Pokemon." Yes, he says he's doing it by expanding the seas, but his point of expanding the seas is very specifically to screw with humans and make it harder for them to mess with the sea. He IS concerned with overfishing and pollution, and he thinks wiping out a bunch of coastal areas will get people to stop doing that.
In Alpha Sapphire I think this was fixed. He didn't want to raise the water level, he just wanted to return the oceans to the way they had been pre-industrialization. He didn't expect the ocean to actually rise.
The way I see it, Team Aqua is surrounded. 

What's under the ocean? That's right, more earth.
It doesn't help that in Omega Ruby, [Maxie's brain nearly stopped working right before waking up Groudon.](https://youtu.be/kFC6mDKF-0c?t=15701) The remakes didn't do him many favors.
I'm reminded of that one episode of Pokemon Generations that focused on Team Aqua: 

Archie: KYOGRE! DESTROY EVERYTHING!!

Kyogre: K. *Proceeds to destroy everything.

Archie: wHaT aRe YoU dOiNg KyOgRe?
I always viewed the two of them as old best friends who got into a simple fight over their starter choices and took it to hilarious levels and somehow had to justify their nonsense
> They are both groups with a legitimate environmental cause

lol.

ironically groudon would solve both concerns if it was used intelligently. there isnt a single brain cell between aqua and magma though so oh well
I have a headcanon about their motives.
Aqua wants earth free of humans and want to reenact the great flood, resetting everything.

Magma wants humanity to flourish even more and want more land for humans. As he regards them as the most superior race in Pokemon world.
Excellent point however Archie is so much cooler, especially in ORAS where he's got the badass WWE pirate design while Maxie is 🤓 personified.
I think that i know why maxie wants to use Groupon power. Hoenn have Just to much water
Both are idiots though. Any ecologist will tell you that the ecosystem means that amount of water will never change. Magma will probably just make the world a more humid place. Aqua will probably just make some parts of the world flooded, yes, but others will remain relatively unchanged.

Also, as far as I know, Groundon and Kyogre's effect are regional. It's not like them causing a drought in Hoenn will have an impact on (mainland) Kalos. The coastal regions, maybe.
    I kinda wonder about that, especially if we take the Rainbow Rocket plot line into consideration.

Wasn't it implied that both Maxie and Archie destroyed their respective worlds?
You kinda missed the main point. Think eco terrorists. The problem both sides had was humanity. Team Aqua wanted to wipe humanity out as they thought we were the problem. And were willing to basically sink the world to do it. Team Magma wanted to expand the land so humanity could grow and thrive. The lessons they learn at the end was manipulating nature is bad. And that they were both being stupid. It’s less of Team Aqua being dumb and more of them being homicidal. Both sides attempted to change the balance of the world which would effectively destroy almost everything regardless as they were messing with the natural order of things.
No, lower the sea levels and the world wil be a hot as fuck, 70% of species are adapted to nowdays temperature, so they will die, also less potable water
I've sene in a video the whole thing is based on a dispute between local fishers and a landfill plan for land development in Japan. The landfill would mean the end of fishing in the area as it would destroy most of the costal habitats, which is what the local population lived off of. I believe it was planned for tourism development, but I could be wrong.
I love Archie and Maxie, they have the worst plans in existence and the power to realize them. They're morons with the genius to make their moronic plans a reality. They're just so PASSIONATE! They want to HELP THE WORLD by making MORE OF THE GOOD STUFF!!
The story isn’t about expanding the sea exactly, but also it is? (I know it’s confusing) it was created during a time in Japan where they were expanding land for humans and others were arguing that leaving the land as is is better for the environment. Expanding into the water for crops might damage other food sources like fish for example, that are the sides aqua and magma represent 

They had to give Archie a goal so his is “flood the planet, but also not because he was upset when he saw kyogre do just that?” It doesn’t make much sense in game without the real world context. Hell even with context his plan is pretty stupid
Archie be like: Tell em to bring out the whole ocean
Overfishing won’t be a problem when all of humanity except those prepared to live in the sea are destroyed.
This is why I like Archie and Maxie's appearance in USUM. It confirms that both their plans are stupid and get them killed even when they "succeed"
The way I see it, kyogre is surrounded. What's under the ocean? That's right, more earth.
I've been thinking recently about how when progression is blocked in that game, it should be because the aqua/magma grunts glued their hands to the road.
I read that as Aqua Teen Hunger Force... I will see myself out
This still remains my favorite detail which is that in emerald Archie could've stolen the submarine undetected and you wouldn't have known where he took it. But instead announces on a megaphone to everyone that he's stealing it then giving out his name and the location of the team aqua hq where it's being taken. I know maxie does the same thing in ruby though I assume emerald is the more or less the definitive game.
[deleted]
    In the games, the museum at slateport city mentions that water covers around 75% of the world surface so it is not 50/50.
With global warming and rising sea levels becoming a real issue it definitely doesn’t age as well haha
You're right, they're really some of the most realistic villains in the series
To be fair, the pokemon world may function a little different and have different issues, so both plans may be equally stupid.
If Archie can make it easier to find a god damn feebas I'm on his side, sorry y'all
I think if they introduced some example of human activity which was encroaching on and destroying a natural resource, that would help justify Team Aqua. For example, they made Pacifidlog Town which sits on top of Corsola. I feel like if they made a point of showing that some Great Barrier Reef equivalent was being damaged by humans (let’s say due to landfill) then Team Aqua might make more sense.
The problem with the Aqua/Magma argument is that it's based off the real world issue that hit Japan where developers wanted to expand the land to build more homes and buildings, while fishermen in the area wanted to leave it alone to not damage the fisheries and local ecosystem.

Aqua makes more sense when you have the historical lens. It's not so much that they want to expand to make more room for fish, but rather to make it harder for humans to encroach.
Having more water is objectively preferable to more land.
Or just play Emerald. Then they are both bad and dumb lol.
I think that’s the point? Have you seen environmental protestors? They are freaking idiots. They throw themselves onto race tracks like that will make people care. All they’ve succeeded in doing is undermine their own movement by making everyone believe that only idiots believe in it.
more and more people are finally saying this
Don't insult Archie he's trying his best ok
...and what about you sitting on a small bird to fly? or a Bibarel (a big beaver) to surf on water? Not to mention driving your bike over cracks to meet a dragon (who doesn't kill you) and if you fall through the cracks you are still alive and cycling around on the lower floor.
Yep.
No both are equally dumb. In the real world ecosystems exist and thrive after millions of years of environment balancing, natural selection and species equalization.

Removing water would severely affect oceanic food chains and since the Pokémon world like ours, especially Hoenn are mostly water it serves as a way to stabilize the weather. The big ocean currents that sit between Slateport and Pacifidlog are probably responsible for helping to cycle oxygen, and nutrients around the region. That brings warm water to and around western Hoenn. A lot then becomes rain that makes the northeast of the region basically a rainforest and if you look around the western half especially south of Mt. Chimney, it's pretty green more temperate, but plenty of greenery around.

This is where removing land cones in. As the rain comes in and helps to make the region tropical, it erodes those nutrients by way of rivers such as the one that forms from the waterfall coming down Route 119. Plenty more are eroded by wave action along the inner sea that My. Pyre sits along and around the beaches near Lilycove.

We've seen what happens when you have too much water or too much land. In the real world, super continents like Pangea also come with a super ocean, the last one was called Panthalassa. The large continents effectively become dry deserts in the middle since moisture can't get to it and the open ocean tends to be a lot less productive than coastal regions. Do the animals and plants eventually adapt? Yes of course, but there is going to be lower diversity than if the land and oceans were more broken up.

The natural order has its ways and the land and water work together. To suddenly start flooding or increasing the amount of sunlight would set off waves of extinctions and mass human migrations that would leave the region inhabitable.

Also, how exactly would that land be created? Cause Maxine seems to forget the two ways Groundon works. Either you have harsh sunlight or volcanic explosions and earthquakes which is how tectonic plates move. The sunlight wouldn't make the water go away right away, all it would do is heat it up. Water absorbs heat very well, it's why it beats fire. All you would do is raise the temperature of the ocean to make it unlivable for the Pokémon, in the real world global warming is basically killing coral reefs off. Meanwhile the teampures on land are also going up, that increases drought, wildfires and crop faliures. We are currently in real time living through that. The volcanic option does not seem ideal either. The only active volcano in Hoenn is Mt. Chimney and it's surrounded on all sides by populated areas. We all thought it was insane to send a rocket into Mt. Chimney, how is letting a giant fire lizard blow it up any better? The populations of Fallarbor, Verdanturf and Lavaridge would all need to be moved and possibly all of Mauville too. That or you leave them there to die. And while Rustboro might be fine, you risk cutting it and all of southwest Hoenn off from the rest of the region. And if you move all those people out where exactly do they go? The biggest city on the eastern half I'd Lilycove and it does not have the space to house all those displaced people. Add the fact that Mauville and Rustboro are the two most technologically advanced areas of the region, so if they are gone it's going to be hard to figure out a solution.

Both ideas are insane which is why the big angry danger noodle in the sky comes and stops it. The fact all of team Magma and Aqua are not jailed is wild.

P.s. my geography degree really came out in this
I mean. Both are very idiotic, the pokemon world is extremely balanced and they just want to meddle with it and cause mass extinctions. Team aqua and magma are by far the worst teams ever.
They aren't meant to be equals. Nor are either team's plans smart.

It's just supposed to be a Brain vs Brawn dynamic.
You've clearly never seen Waterworld. :P
Imagine IGN's rating if Team Aqua had succeded.
Maxie should've wrestled Groudon like Archie did with Kyogre.
The old maxie was a dork, look at him stand, they enjoy the sea the most so they go for it.

They were very dumb.
Team Aqua should just watch IGN’s review and put their plans to rest.
Remember that in emerald, after awakening groudon and let him devaste the entire region freely, team magma decide to use fusee fuel to create an éruption. I don t  think that their are the smartest team in hoenn here.
I GM a roleplay group in Hoenn.

Found the more land vs more water approach stupid. So I gave them other motivations.


Team Magma actually is part of Devon Corp. They are very technological in their approach to achieve balance. They are not against owning Pokémon, but they want em treated right an human habitats not to encroach to much. Technology makes it possible to be space and resource efficient.


Team Aqua is a known environmental group. They lack funding though. They fight to protect reefs, end pollution and they study water pokémon.


In the end both factions have different preferences and approaches, not noticing how great it would be to team up, but also not actively fighting each other. With their project they have been disturbing ley lines. That is a problem, because magic (or the pokémon energy) is behaving very erratic. That way I explain my huge Boss Pokémon and why one of my players now has a poison eveelution. 
They unknowingly disturbed something. I will see if they actually find out what they did and if they try and make it right. For now my trainers met baddies of both factions and saw them causing trouble by being dangerous to humans. (Okay, also one trainer is after Magma, because his Scyther was kidnapped a few years ago and all he found was a Magma glove. There is plenty hate to go around.)
They are both stupid, but from what I picked up Archie wasn't so much teying to create more habitat for Pokemon as much as he was hitting the evolutionary reset button to try to lwt the world re-evolce without humans.
Nah fam. Magma is just as stupid as Aqua.
I think you put more thought into this than they did
>  Real marine ecologists are concerned about overfishing and pollution

More water means current pollution levels are diluted and the habits of ecology are probably changed, which would temporarily solve both of these problems
*post sponsored by magma gang
I played Sapphire first, and it always made sense to me that Team Magma were the good guys helping you stop Team Aqua

Personally though, I think Team Sky is by far the greatest Hoenn team
It does come off that way in game, but apparently the Team Aqua/Team Magma plot was meant to be a parallel to debates around real life land reclamation projects going on near where Game Freak is located at the time. Team Aqua was meant to parallel those opposed to the projects because it would reduce coastal sea life habitats.
Magma tried to jam a rocket into a volcano so no, they're just as stupid. The whole magma/aqua conflict was bad to where even back then I thought it was really dumb.  There's an argument to be made they're some of the worst written teams.  That said I think ORAS at least helped their characterization a lot.
But isn't Aquas idea to force people out of coastal areas by rapidly rising sea levels and high tide and eventually will be in need to live in towns like pacifidlog town where people and marine life coexist?
Are they stupid?
Maxie couldn't lift 100 lbs. Therefore your point is invalid.

    Keeogri
        Back when Kyogre and Groudons first began on Pokémon go, many of the community I’m in called them, “groodun,” and, “keeogri.”
            Keeogri I can almost get, but had the people saying groodun never heard the word ground? He's literally a ground type and the name is just ground without the n
                It’s like the ramen shop I work at… “Rayman” doesn’t bother me much, at least the letters are all there. But the other day we had someone calling them “Romain” noodles and I wanted to scream ;o;
                    When you only have one noodle it's a raman bowl
                Yeah I kept telling people he’s not a disgraced football coach he’s a god damn land beast!
                    The emails Groudon sent to the pokemon league might change your mind idk
                From my experience, this is the time when most kids learned what croutons were, and they probably associated the spelling with that lol. Also, why didn’t they just go with Groundon?
                    Why didn't they just call Kyogre Groundoff?
                        Why isn’t Rayquaza Flyogre???
                    Yeah they were like 40+ lol
                It might be a reference to one of the Pokemon raps, which mispronounced both of them in those ways
            I called it Kroger
                I have 2 named Kyle and Kroger lmao
            Ruby and Sapphire came out when I was in like the third grade and I definitely thought it was groodun
    The fact that's he's winning 💀
    “At least you get a dad in this one” lol good point
    I had not, thank you for starting my day!
    Isn't this just the plot of Avatar?
    This is sublime.
There's also this [comic](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/sonic/images/5/5f/4ed.png/revision/latest?cb=20150105155248) that sums up Archie pretty well.
    Reminds me of [this Maxie comic, my dude.](https://pin.it/4jR9aOy)
        Super Beard Bros are playing Ocarina of Time named My Dude and it kills me every time. Definitely have to do that sometime soon in a similar game.
    Absolutely hilarious, thanks for that
Came here to reference that
    Fun fact, that's how I decided to get Alpha Sapphire instead of Omega Ruby
        Based. I got omega ruby for Christmas, but was always a kyogre guy. You bet your ass I traded my groudon for a kyogre as soon as I could!
        Pirates are also way cooler, my 7,8/10 too much water monotyoe nuzlocke would have been too easy in OR and goddamn shirtless Hunk villains...
        Objectively correct decision since 2003.
            Also helps AS has imo one of the coolest easter eggs in the series. Revealing in the hideout that in the past Archie and his admins befriended a Jirachi, something OR has no counter Easter egg for, just something specific to those 3. Even Cooler was recently in Pokemon Masters them using the small Easter Egg as a bit of a focal point for an event.
                >Revealing in the hideout that in the past Archie and his admins befriended a Jirachi

Where was that revealed? I honestly don't remember.
                    It is in Shelly's room I believe. She has a picture of them together
            Counter point: ORAS Courtney is HOT
                This logic is irrefutable
                Counter-counter point: Alpha Sapphire Shelly.
            Sapphire superiority has been a mental illness for 20 years my god 😔
                Sorry I can't hear you over the sound of KYOGRE SHOOTING GROUDON IN THE FACE WITH HYDRO PUMP
                    And then Primal Groudon's Desolate Land immediately evaporates that water and it does no damage
                        Retconned in 2019 😊
                            And yet Episode Delta acknowledged that the retcon and the original universe coexist. In one timeline, Primal Groudon wins, and in the other, Kyogre uses hydro pump with Drizzle and wins immediately. In yet another, Rayquaza makes them both stop that.
                If by mental ilness you mean incontrovertible truth, yes. ✋️
Yeah, I saw it too.
Oh god, hidden memory right there.  I used Archie’s face from that panel as a profile picture on Steam for a while.
At least Team Aqua is upfront about being a bunch of dumbasses, while Team Magma acts like they are highly intellegent scientists and then come up with this dumb plan.
    I think that presentation is only in the remakes. If I'm remembering correctly, they act pretty much the same as each other in the original releases
        In the original the team leaders fulfilled their respective stereotypes. In the remakes the teams became more of a reflection of these stereotypes with the team admins especially being given more 'depth'. They definitely made the stereotypes more extreme in the remakes.
        I just replayed Emerald. Archie isn't really presented as an idiot, but he's not presented as pretending to be smart. He's just a thug that leads a group of thugs. Maxie is presented as trying to be a smart guy though.
        Granted I played Ruby, but I did a gen 3 play through and both teams were pretty basic “I love land/water and hate the other team”
    Not necessarily. It's more Maxie tries to be the smartest person in the room despite how much of a dumbass he is, as opposed to Archie who doesn't always pretend to know what's going on.
    it is true though. most of the ocean is a lifeless bowl of water, if they just used groudon to make some extra landmasses out in the middle of the ocean(and maybe raised up a portion of the ocean in a ring of mountains to counteract the displacement) both teams would be satisfied. in fact paiso probably did more to advance both teams agendas than they ever will.
Ironically, this is the exact same gen that has entire city floating on the ocean lol
[deleted]
    I like how in the movie Lugia was created as the primal deity of the sea, but in the games it just lives in acave because its home burned down.
There's actually a fun story about how the idea for them came to be!

Tokyo, where Game Freak is located, is an extremely dense city with very little room to expand in most directions.  The only way to get more space would be to build out into the ocean in some way.  During Gen 3's development this was quite the hot topic, people talking about the extra space for building or the impact on the ecosystem and all that fun stuff, and Game Freak decided it'd be fun to blow up those arguments to ridiculous proportions and imagine cults of people fiercely at war about whether there should be *more* land *everywhere* or more *ocean* everywhere.

And it just goes to show, your villains don't have to make sense to be enjoyable.  The plot's dumb, but the insanity of their plans lends them a certain charisma anyways that gets us talking and laughing about it even years later.
Thanks, I needed that one
To this day that’s still the only pokemon meme my parents understood lmao
    They definitely need to be informed about Ferrothorn's homophobia
        Why is Ferrothorn homophobic? :O

Honestly their plans were both more nonsensical than Lance and Agatha's 'destroy cities until humans stop polluting' strategy in Adventures.
    rinse full disagreeable door slim seemly light poor ripe north

 *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*
        >the main issue i have with plots like this in the pokemon world is the world never really seems to have these issues. the world is very solarpunk where people co exist with nature and animals, and they have a wider array of energy sources to the point that things like energy related corruption is a very hard premise to buy.

Yeah, the games have become more utopian while the real world is starting to really feel the effects. Its ridiculous that Rose was worried about energy that wouldn't run out for 2000 years, when oil could be gone in 50 and unaffordable for most people to fuel their cars much earlier than that.
        Idk, gen 1 was really about industry and science reigning over nature. In the yellow arc there were a lot of chapters about the effects of pollutions, like Yellow training in a desert, the Power Plant's wastes going into rivers, or Exeggutors and Oddishes migrating because their forests were no more. The solarpunk aesthetic came later.
        Well, corpses might be unhealthy to be around, but they shouldn’t be more polluting than naturally decomposing animals.
    I don't know about that. The Adventures Elite Four plot was absurdly stupid.
        I didn’t think it was that stupid, at least not for Lorelei and Lance. They both personally saw how humans had messed with the environment and were hurting Pokemon. So they felt that getting rid of humans would allow Pokemon to prosper. Never really got why Agatha joined, besides bitterness towards Oak. And Bruno didn’t care about the plans.
            True.  They were more fanatical and extreme than plain stupid, in my opinion.
            Lance was pretty much throwing a temper tantrum deciding because of a few bad experiences he's going to try and murder everyone, not considering how nigh impossible it would be even with his power and how much pollution and destruction it would cause by itself regardless. He wasn't planning on killing literally everyone either, so he was pretty much trying to enact Team Plasma's goal, only he deluded himself into thinking he was actually a savior instead of a villain or complete moron. Lorelei was sort of similar, except she was manipulated by Agatha, a bit too easily from what I recall as well.

Don't remember why exactly Agatha joined either. I think she felt the same, but her hatred of Oak was focused on more. Really wonder why Bruno was even with them in the first place instead of generically wandering the world looking for strong opponents.
                For some reason I didn’t see your reply until way later. I do think that their plot was excessive, I at least felt it made sense contextually. I guess it depends on what you meant by stupid. I think they just invited Bruno to join them. He does care about the environment of Pokemon, as seen during the Red/Bruno flashback. So maybe that helped. I think Lorelei was a child when Agatha recruited her, so Lorelei being manipulated easily didn’t bother me too much.
                    I guess Bruno is like Agatha then if there was a flashback that showed him caring. I mostly only recall him wanting to fight strong opponents and had to be controlled to actually do anything for the plan.

That's not exactly what I meant by Lorelei being easily convinced. It's more the pace of the flashback was way too fast.
                        Yeah, Bruno didn't really seem to care about the plan, I think he said as much. It ended up making his inclusion in the Johto E4 feel a lot more natural though.

Also yeah, I guess they really didn't want to spend too much time on the backstories of the villains. Even Lance got a couple scenes at most.
            Bruno was mind controlled no?
                He joined them of his own volition I believe, but all of his worst acts were done when he was mind controlled.
        They were the fusion of team plasma and flare.
    I need to read that it sounds wild
        Pokemon Adventures (AKA Pokemon Special) had a way more exciting narrative than any of the anime adaptations, and most of the games. The Yellow saga was probably the best of it. At least through Gen III, I haven't read Diamond and Pearl.
    Lance and Agatha should join Team Flare then, they'd get along.
Yes and no, depends on the game. In Sapphire their plan was simply to just Add More Ocean because they felt that would be an ideal world to live in. In Alpha Sapphire it was expanded upon to be what you said. Wipe out humanity and technology with a great flood so that pokemon as a whole (not just marine ones) can thrive again.

ORAS Magma vs Aqua can basically be boiled down to "I want humanity to thrive, screw pokemon" vs "I want pokemon to thrive, screw humanity" instead of "more land vs more sea" in the originals.
    Aqua wasn't a bunch of goofballs in the originals either.  Although they did seem to have a major lack of understanding about the water cycle.
        This is the thing I miss about the original Team Magma and Aqua. They both feel like mafias (just look at OG Archie and Maxie's appearances). They might be dumb, but they're scary. The redesigns make Maxie too nerdy and Archie too goofy.

Well, at least I got redesigned Courtney out of it, so I guess that's a silver lining.
            At least now they feel like dofferent characters. Back then they were literal clones.
            We also got redesigned Tabitha, so we're still at a net loss on Magma.
But we also got Matt and Shelly, so +1 on Aqua.
            they totally dyslexia'd on shelly tho, and that was a fuckin tragedy.
                Remake shelly goes hard imo
        I think they just wanted more water in existence, and water pokemon can create water from… well, not H or O particles.  And the Pokémon that can create the most water is Kyogre using it’s perpetual rain cloud summoning ability.
it would not, we have a delicate ecosystem that anamolies like that would create a ton of imbalance. certain sea creatures rely the water to be a certain pressure, fresh and salt water creatures would be displaced, pretty much the reasons why scientists say the biblical flood wouldnt happen are the rammifications of what team aqua would have caused. 

&#x200B;

sea creatures that give birth on land would be in jeopardy, loss of coastal habits would mess up feeding and breeding grounds, coral reefs are very sensitive to sea level rising, which would be detrimental to creatures that rely on coral for food and shelter. nutrient runoff can cause algae to over grow and cause oxygen levels to drop leading to more death. 

&#x200B;

the chain reactions of these events would not even help the ocean creatures. so i'd say both their plans are 50/50 as dumb as each others.
In fairness they weren't trying to start the apocalypse. Their math was just off.

I don't think they considered it possible for either Pokémon to be as powerful as they were.
    Yeah, it's not like there were historical notes about someone else riviving Hoenn's legendaries in the past and bringing the apocalypse.

They'd have been really stupid to do it in that case.
I guess Giovanni is just standard mafia stuff with pokemon. There's also a theory that he had a reasonable plan to fight Mewtwo, by gathering ghost types with the silph scope, and getting the Master Ball.
    His plan was smaller scale anyways.  He didn't want to reshape the globe with dramatic legendaries and mythological giants - he just wanted to rule the criminal underworld and oppose any resistance against him.
        team rainbow rocket giovanni: say that again punk i dare ya
            Oh yeah.  I forgot about the true boss of bosses.
    >  by gathering ghost types with the silph scope, and getting the Master Ball.

Interesting, never heard of it before.
        It's not even that much of a stretch. Silph Co designed both, Rocket invaded Silph Co, and maybe it was only in FRLG but I thought they specifically mentioned Rocket wanting the Master Ball.
Team Rocket doesn't do plans. They see something they want, they use force to take it.

In Team Galactic, Cyrus is the only one who knows he plans to destroy reality and remake it in his image. Everyone else just does what they're told and trusts Cyrus that it will make things better.

Team Flare makes zero sense, because the kinds of people who would join Team Flare are the kinds of people who make the world "Ugly" as Lysander says. He'd be genociding the people who could be part of the solution while gathering people who would be part of the problem.

Team Skull doesn't do plans unless Lusamine is bossing them around.

Lusamine's actually insane and her goals are nonsensical in the first place, her plans to achieve them are even more so.

Team Yell's plan is absolutely idiotic. They want to ensure Marnie wins by harassing the competition, but if Rose wasn't busy trying to save the future they'd get Marnie disqualified and Spikmuth's gym shut down due to their interference.

Rose's plan is logically sound, but his goals are insane. Rose suffers from a messiah complex and it shows.
    Lusamines plan in SM is literally just to go to Ultra Space with her Jellyfish mommy. So her plan full on works. It is canonically inspired by a bout of alien induced insanity, but the plan is sound. In USUM, her plan isn’t terrible, she’s just woefully unprepared and to be honest, I can understand why she’d consider herself a better candidate than a teenager to fight Necrozma.

As for Rose, I don’t see why he didn’t just wait like one day. His plan is fine because he’s under the assumption he can control and harness Eternatus, but that’s not even the source of conflict really. Leon was mainly mad that a fucking sports tournament would be interrupted so I don’t particularly get why either the tournament could be postponed a day or why Rose couldn’t wait one day??
        >As for Rose, I don’t see why he didn’t just wait like one day

Because the player was the first trainer in years who had a shot at beating Leon, and his plan falls apart if Leon stops being champion.

Rose needs Leon to catch Eternatus, and use Eternatus in official battles in order to collect energy from them.

If Leon retires from training after losing his champion status or decides he's not qualified to help, Rose's plan is shot.

He needed Leon to be the one to catch Eternatus, and once Leon had Eternatus it would be a staple of his team and Leon would genuinely become unbeatable, ensuring Leon would remain champion for the rest of his life, and Eternatus would keep supplying Galar with infinite energy.
They all make sense in theory, the problem is all of them are dumbasses.
Alolan plan made decent sense, at least in Sun and Moon.  USUM also made sense but like, they were woefully unprepared for the missions.  Like at least make sure you have your UB Killing Machines under control(Silvally) and actually functioning before you enact your plan.
One of my favourite YouTube vids, loved the background.

Shame they didn't execute the concept throughout the games. Hoenn is depicted as a utopia where people, Pokemon and the land are already living in harmony - so both teams seem insane. If these issues around conservation v development were shown in game it would have made heaps more sense.
Tbf, I think that can be said for almost any evil villain mega-plot ever
    I mean Lysandre did consider that a lot of both People and Pokemon would die, but felt it was necessary.
        In reality that's just an excuse, Lysander hated people from the start for being elitists despite being elitists himself.
            Kinda refreshing to have a villain that just goes "Fuck it, killing everyone".
                I would have agreed to that but team flare overall is a special kind of stupid so that makes it a moot point.
                    X/Y really needed that third game.
                        Sadly I don't think a third game can fix that mess with out a complete overhaul to x and y's story.
The OG Nuzlocke comic springs to mind immediately. "What do you mean 'It's really hot and everyone is dying'? I don't understand... How can water be *good*?"
Tabitha: "No, Maxie, don't do it! If you use that, the world is gonna end!"

Maxie: *pushes button anyway* ".... yo yo yo WAIT! What's going on, what does it start a damn apocalypse now?!"

Tabitha: "I just fricking told you it's gonna end the world!"

Maxie: "I thought you said 'the world is gonna blend'!"

Tabitha: "WHY THE HELL WOULD I SAY THAT?!"

Maxie: "I DON'T KNOW, OK? IT SOUNDED SO DUMB, THAT'S WHY I IGNORED IT IN THE FIRST PLACE!"
Pokemon that can use water type moves can use surf in the middle of a desert which summons a giant wave to crash into the opponent. Even tiny Pokemon. I'm pretty sure it safe to assume they can magic up water out of nowhere. The better question is how isn't the world already flooded using the game logic.
    Because it's balanced by having grass types to absorb the water, and fire types with ridiculous body temperatures to evaporate excess.

I'm looking at you, *Magcargo*.
        I'm pretty sure the evaporation from fire types would just add to the water cycle instead of eliminating it but I didn't think of grass types. That's a pretty good balance to the creation of water. I think we solved this mystery.
    Well you see, all of the Vaporeons, Poliwags, Quagsires and other Pokemon with Water Absorb are absorbing all of this excess water created by Surf, Hydro Pump and other Water moves.

It's all balanced!
        Damn you're right. I definitely failed Pokemon biology.
    its conjured water, not real. it has all the properties of water but ceases to exist once the pokemon stops focusing on it.

alternatively, water pokemon have alot more water in their bodies than their size would suggest, and they hide its weight the same way that pokeballs do.
Source?  Isn't the reef dying from rising sea temps?
    You seem to have misunderstood my comment. 10,000 years ago, the GBR did not exist; what is now the Reef was still dry land. Some time within the last 10,000 years, rising sea levels caused the land to be flooded. Around the Reef is a series of Islands, which are the tips of mountains from before the flood. This created an area of ocean which was mostly protected by strong ocean currents, which facilitated the formation of the Reef. Thus, it was rising sea levels that allowed the Reef to form.
        so someone should use (a)groudon to raise a hundred or so pillars out of the bottom of the ocean and have them stop like twenty or so feet under the surface
    The reef is actually dying from carbon dioxide concentration. Basically all the CO2 dissolves into the water, which changes the acidity and dissolves the outer layer of the reefs (causing the bleaching).

I think a big issue with environmentalist concerns is that a lot of complex issues are boiled down to “global warming.” Of course climate change is a big issue, but a lot of environmental issues are caused by a variety of chemicals. Fertilizer, insecticides, CO2, etc all cause major problems in different ways (and can usually cause multiple problems each like CO2 causing warming and ocean acidification).
That would make sense. Archie does mention making more habitats for water Pokemon, and reefs have a tremendously diverse population in real life.
Team Magma saw Star Wars and was like, “I wanna live on Tatooine!”
    I was thinking film about land development but that's good too
        Are there any culturally relevant films about land development? I can’t think of any.

                I clicked the first link in that search & read through the list, and honestly I haven’t even seen most of them. The 2 I have seen the author specifically mentions aren’t actually related to land development.
                    Ah gotcha
Lawrence of Arabia.
    Alrighty then
Maxie read the Bible and want to become Moses maybe.
My decision making for choosing Team Aqua over Team Magma XD.

Shelly supremacy!
I kinda wonder about that, especially if we take the Rainbow Rocket plot line into consideration.

Wasn't it implied that both Maxie and Archie destroyed their respective worlds?
In the games, the museum at slateport city mentions that water covers around 75% of the world surface so it is not 50/50.
Keeogri
    Back when Kyogre and Groudons first began on Pokémon go, many of the community I’m in called them, “groodun,” and, “keeogri.”
        Keeogri I can almost get, but had the people saying groodun never heard the word ground? He's literally a ground type and the name is just ground without the n
            It’s like the ramen shop I work at… “Rayman” doesn’t bother me much, at least the letters are all there. But the other day we had someone calling them “Romain” noodles and I wanted to scream ;o;
                When you only have one noodle it's a raman bowl
            Yeah I kept telling people he’s not a disgraced football coach he’s a god damn land beast!
                The emails Groudon sent to the pokemon league might change your mind idk
            From my experience, this is the time when most kids learned what croutons were, and they probably associated the spelling with that lol. Also, why didn’t they just go with Groundon?
                Why didn't they just call Kyogre Groundoff?
                    Why isn’t Rayquaza Flyogre???
                Yeah they were like 40+ lol
            It might be a reference to one of the Pokemon raps, which mispronounced both of them in those ways
        I called it Kroger
            I have 2 named Kyle and Kroger lmao
        Ruby and Sapphire came out when I was in like the third grade and I definitely thought it was groodun
The fact that's he's winning 💀
“At least you get a dad in this one” lol good point
I had not, thank you for starting my day!
Isn't this just the plot of Avatar?
This is sublime.
Reminds me of [this Maxie comic, my dude.](https://pin.it/4jR9aOy)
    Super Beard Bros are playing Ocarina of Time named My Dude and it kills me every time. Definitely have to do that sometime soon in a similar game.
Absolutely hilarious, thanks for that
Fun fact, that's how I decided to get Alpha Sapphire instead of Omega Ruby
    Based. I got omega ruby for Christmas, but was always a kyogre guy. You bet your ass I traded my groudon for a kyogre as soon as I could!
    Pirates are also way cooler, my 7,8/10 too much water monotyoe nuzlocke would have been too easy in OR and goddamn shirtless Hunk villains...
    Objectively correct decision since 2003.
        Also helps AS has imo one of the coolest easter eggs in the series. Revealing in the hideout that in the past Archie and his admins befriended a Jirachi, something OR has no counter Easter egg for, just something specific to those 3. Even Cooler was recently in Pokemon Masters them using the small Easter Egg as a bit of a focal point for an event.
            >Revealing in the hideout that in the past Archie and his admins befriended a Jirachi

Where was that revealed? I honestly don't remember.
                It is in Shelly's room I believe. She has a picture of them together
        Counter point: ORAS Courtney is HOT
            This logic is irrefutable
            Counter-counter point: Alpha Sapphire Shelly.
        Sapphire superiority has been a mental illness for 20 years my god 😔
            Sorry I can't hear you over the sound of KYOGRE SHOOTING GROUDON IN THE FACE WITH HYDRO PUMP
                And then Primal Groudon's Desolate Land immediately evaporates that water and it does no damage
                    Retconned in 2019 😊
                        And yet Episode Delta acknowledged that the retcon and the original universe coexist. In one timeline, Primal Groudon wins, and in the other, Kyogre uses hydro pump with Drizzle and wins immediately. In yet another, Rayquaza makes them both stop that.
            If by mental ilness you mean incontrovertible truth, yes. ✋️
I think that presentation is only in the remakes. If I'm remembering correctly, they act pretty much the same as each other in the original releases
    In the original the team leaders fulfilled their respective stereotypes. In the remakes the teams became more of a reflection of these stereotypes with the team admins especially being given more 'depth'. They definitely made the stereotypes more extreme in the remakes.
    I just replayed Emerald. Archie isn't really presented as an idiot, but he's not presented as pretending to be smart. He's just a thug that leads a group of thugs. Maxie is presented as trying to be a smart guy though.
    Granted I played Ruby, but I did a gen 3 play through and both teams were pretty basic “I love land/water and hate the other team”
Not necessarily. It's more Maxie tries to be the smartest person in the room despite how much of a dumbass he is, as opposed to Archie who doesn't always pretend to know what's going on.
it is true though. most of the ocean is a lifeless bowl of water, if they just used groudon to make some extra landmasses out in the middle of the ocean(and maybe raised up a portion of the ocean in a ring of mountains to counteract the displacement) both teams would be satisfied. in fact paiso probably did more to advance both teams agendas than they ever will.
I like how in the movie Lugia was created as the primal deity of the sea, but in the games it just lives in acave because its home burned down.
They definitely need to be informed about Ferrothorn's homophobia
    Why is Ferrothorn homophobic? :O

    >the main issue i have with plots like this in the pokemon world is the world never really seems to have these issues. the world is very solarpunk where people co exist with nature and animals, and they have a wider array of energy sources to the point that things like energy related corruption is a very hard premise to buy.

Yeah, the games have become more utopian while the real world is starting to really feel the effects. Its ridiculous that Rose was worried about energy that wouldn't run out for 2000 years, when oil could be gone in 50 and unaffordable for most people to fuel their cars much earlier than that.
    Idk, gen 1 was really about industry and science reigning over nature. In the yellow arc there were a lot of chapters about the effects of pollutions, like Yellow training in a desert, the Power Plant's wastes going into rivers, or Exeggutors and Oddishes migrating because their forests were no more. The solarpunk aesthetic came later.
    Well, corpses might be unhealthy to be around, but they shouldn’t be more polluting than naturally decomposing animals.
I don't know about that. The Adventures Elite Four plot was absurdly stupid.
    I didn’t think it was that stupid, at least not for Lorelei and Lance. They both personally saw how humans had messed with the environment and were hurting Pokemon. So they felt that getting rid of humans would allow Pokemon to prosper. Never really got why Agatha joined, besides bitterness towards Oak. And Bruno didn’t care about the plans.
        True.  They were more fanatical and extreme than plain stupid, in my opinion.
        Lance was pretty much throwing a temper tantrum deciding because of a few bad experiences he's going to try and murder everyone, not considering how nigh impossible it would be even with his power and how much pollution and destruction it would cause by itself regardless. He wasn't planning on killing literally everyone either, so he was pretty much trying to enact Team Plasma's goal, only he deluded himself into thinking he was actually a savior instead of a villain or complete moron. Lorelei was sort of similar, except she was manipulated by Agatha, a bit too easily from what I recall as well.

Don't remember why exactly Agatha joined either. I think she felt the same, but her hatred of Oak was focused on more. Really wonder why Bruno was even with them in the first place instead of generically wandering the world looking for strong opponents.
            For some reason I didn’t see your reply until way later. I do think that their plot was excessive, I at least felt it made sense contextually. I guess it depends on what you meant by stupid. I think they just invited Bruno to join them. He does care about the environment of Pokemon, as seen during the Red/Bruno flashback. So maybe that helped. I think Lorelei was a child when Agatha recruited her, so Lorelei being manipulated easily didn’t bother me too much.
                I guess Bruno is like Agatha then if there was a flashback that showed him caring. I mostly only recall him wanting to fight strong opponents and had to be controlled to actually do anything for the plan.

That's not exactly what I meant by Lorelei being easily convinced. It's more the pace of the flashback was way too fast.
                    Yeah, Bruno didn't really seem to care about the plan, I think he said as much. It ended up making his inclusion in the Johto E4 feel a lot more natural though.

Also yeah, I guess they really didn't want to spend too much time on the backstories of the villains. Even Lance got a couple scenes at most.
        Bruno was mind controlled no?
            He joined them of his own volition I believe, but all of his worst acts were done when he was mind controlled.
    They were the fusion of team plasma and flare.

        From my experience, this is the time when most kids learned what croutons were, and they probably associated the spelling with that lol. Also, why didn’t they just go with Groundon?
            Why didn't they just call Kyogre Groundoff?
                Why isn’t Rayquaza Flyogre???
            Yeah they were like 40+ lol
        It might be a reference to one of the Pokemon raps, which mispronounced both of them in those ways
    I called it Kroger
        I have 2 named Kyle and Kroger lmao
    Ruby and Sapphire came out when I was in like the third grade and I definitely thought it was groodun
Super Beard Bros are playing Ocarina of Time named My Dude and it kills me every time. Definitely have to do that sometime soon in a similar game.
Based. I got omega ruby for Christmas, but was always a kyogre guy. You bet your ass I traded my groudon for a kyogre as soon as I could!
Pirates are also way cooler, my 7,8/10 too much water monotyoe nuzlocke would have been too easy in OR and goddamn shirtless Hunk villains...
Objectively correct decision since 2003.
    Also helps AS has imo one of the coolest easter eggs in the series. Revealing in the hideout that in the past Archie and his admins befriended a Jirachi, something OR has no counter Easter egg for, just something specific to those 3. Even Cooler was recently in Pokemon Masters them using the small Easter Egg as a bit of a focal point for an event.
        >Revealing in the hideout that in the past Archie and his admins befriended a Jirachi

Where was that revealed? I honestly don't remember.
            It is in Shelly's room I believe. She has a picture of them together
    Counter point: ORAS Courtney is HOT
        This logic is irrefutable
        Counter-counter point: Alpha Sapphire Shelly.
    Sapphire superiority has been a mental illness for 20 years my god 😔
        Sorry I can't hear you over the sound of KYOGRE SHOOTING GROUDON IN THE FACE WITH HYDRO PUMP
            And then Primal Groudon's Desolate Land immediately evaporates that water and it does no damage
                Retconned in 2019 😊
                    And yet Episode Delta acknowledged that the retcon and the original universe coexist. In one timeline, Primal Groudon wins, and in the other, Kyogre uses hydro pump with Drizzle and wins immediately. In yet another, Rayquaza makes them both stop that.
        If by mental ilness you mean incontrovertible truth, yes. ✋️
In the original the team leaders fulfilled their respective stereotypes. In the remakes the teams became more of a reflection of these stereotypes with the team admins especially being given more 'depth'. They definitely made the stereotypes more extreme in the remakes.
I just replayed Emerald. Archie isn't really presented as an idiot, but he's not presented as pretending to be smart. He's just a thug that leads a group of thugs. Maxie is presented as trying to be a smart guy though.
Granted I played Ruby, but I did a gen 3 play through and both teams were pretty basic “I love land/water and hate the other team”
Why is Ferrothorn homophobic? :O

        Ohhhhh. Thank you. :>
>the main issue i have with plots like this in the pokemon world is the world never really seems to have these issues. the world is very solarpunk where people co exist with nature and animals, and they have a wider array of energy sources to the point that things like energy related corruption is a very hard premise to buy.

Yeah, the games have become more utopian while the real world is starting to really feel the effects. Its ridiculous that Rose was worried about energy that wouldn't run out for 2000 years, when oil could be gone in 50 and unaffordable for most people to fuel their cars much earlier than that.
Idk, gen 1 was really about industry and science reigning over nature. In the yellow arc there were a lot of chapters about the effects of pollutions, like Yellow training in a desert, the Power Plant's wastes going into rivers, or Exeggutors and Oddishes migrating because their forests were no more. The solarpunk aesthetic came later.
Well, corpses might be unhealthy to be around, but they shouldn’t be more polluting than naturally decomposing animals.
I didn’t think it was that stupid, at least not for Lorelei and Lance. They both personally saw how humans had messed with the environment and were hurting Pokemon. So they felt that getting rid of humans would allow Pokemon to prosper. Never really got why Agatha joined, besides bitterness towards Oak. And Bruno didn’t care about the plans.
    True.  They were more fanatical and extreme than plain stupid, in my opinion.
    Lance was pretty much throwing a temper tantrum deciding because of a few bad experiences he's going to try and murder everyone, not considering how nigh impossible it would be even with his power and how much pollution and destruction it would cause by itself regardless. He wasn't planning on killing literally everyone either, so he was pretty much trying to enact Team Plasma's goal, only he deluded himself into thinking he was actually a savior instead of a villain or complete moron. Lorelei was sort of similar, except she was manipulated by Agatha, a bit too easily from what I recall as well.

Don't remember why exactly Agatha joined either. I think she felt the same, but her hatred of Oak was focused on more. Really wonder why Bruno was even with them in the first place instead of generically wandering the world looking for strong opponents.
        For some reason I didn’t see your reply until way later. I do think that their plot was excessive, I at least felt it made sense contextually. I guess it depends on what you meant by stupid. I think they just invited Bruno to join them. He does care about the environment of Pokemon, as seen during the Red/Bruno flashback. So maybe that helped. I think Lorelei was a child when Agatha recruited her, so Lorelei being manipulated easily didn’t bother me too much.
            I guess Bruno is like Agatha then if there was a flashback that showed him caring. I mostly only recall him wanting to fight strong opponents and had to be controlled to actually do anything for the plan.

That's not exactly what I meant by Lorelei being easily convinced. It's more the pace of the flashback was way too fast.
                Yeah, Bruno didn't really seem to care about the plan, I think he said as much. It ended up making his inclusion in the Johto E4 feel a lot more natural though.

Also yeah, I guess they really didn't want to spend too much time on the backstories of the villains. Even Lance got a couple scenes at most.
    Bruno was mind controlled no?
        He joined them of his own volition I believe, but all of his worst acts were done when he was mind controlled.
They were the fusion of team plasma and flare.
Pokemon Adventures (AKA Pokemon Special) had a way more exciting narrative than any of the anime adaptations, and most of the games. The Yellow saga was probably the best of it. At least through Gen III, I haven't read Diamond and Pearl.
This is the thing I miss about the original Team Magma and Aqua. They both feel like mafias (just look at OG Archie and Maxie's appearances). They might be dumb, but they're scary. The redesigns make Maxie too nerdy and Archie too goofy.

Well, at least I got redesigned Courtney out of it, so I guess that's a silver lining.
    At least now they feel like dofferent characters. Back then they were literal clones.
    We also got redesigned Tabitha, so we're still at a net loss on Magma.
But we also got Matt and Shelly, so +1 on Aqua.
    they totally dyslexia'd on shelly tho, and that was a fuckin tragedy.
        Remake shelly goes hard imo
I think they just wanted more water in existence, and water pokemon can create water from… well, not H or O particles.  And the Pokémon that can create the most water is Kyogre using it’s perpetual rain cloud summoning ability.
team rainbow rocket giovanni: say that again punk i dare ya
    Oh yeah.  I forgot about the true boss of bosses.
It's not even that much of a stretch. Silph Co designed both, Rocket invaded Silph Co, and maybe it was only in FRLG but I thought they specifically mentioned Rocket wanting the Master Ball.
>As for Rose, I don’t see why he didn’t just wait like one day

Because the player was the first trainer in years who had a shot at beating Leon, and his plan falls apart if Leon stops being champion.

Rose needs Leon to catch Eternatus, and use Eternatus in official battles in order to collect energy from them.

If Leon retires from training after losing his champion status or decides he's not qualified to help, Rose's plan is shot.

He needed Leon to be the one to catch Eternatus, and once Leon had Eternatus it would be a staple of his team and Leon would genuinely become unbeatable, ensuring Leon would remain champion for the rest of his life, and Eternatus would keep supplying Galar with infinite energy.
In reality that's just an excuse, Lysander hated people from the start for being elitists despite being elitists himself.
    Kinda refreshing to have a villain that just goes "Fuck it, killing everyone".
        I would have agreed to that but team flare overall is a special kind of stupid so that makes it a moot point.
            X/Y really needed that third game.
                Sadly I don't think a third game can fix that mess with out a complete overhaul to x and y's story.
I'm pretty sure the evaporation from fire types would just add to the water cycle instead of eliminating it but I didn't think of grass types. That's a pretty good balance to the creation of water. I think we solved this mystery.
Damn you're right. I definitely failed Pokemon biology.
so someone should use (a)groudon to raise a hundred or so pillars out of the bottom of the ocean and have them stop like twenty or so feet under the surface
Are there any culturally relevant films about land development? I can’t think of any.

Keeogri I can almost get, but had the people saying groodun never heard the word ground? He's literally a ground type and the name is just ground without the n
    It’s like the ramen shop I work at… “Rayman” doesn’t bother me much, at least the letters are all there. But the other day we had someone calling them “Romain” noodles and I wanted to scream ;o;
