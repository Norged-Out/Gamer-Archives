[[Every single time I’m abt to face the Rayquaza in rubysapphireemerald.]]





I always save my masterball thinking I’ll need it later on but then when I go to start a new file I still have it and I get upset that I never used it.

    This is me, but add in elixirs, max elixirs, ethers and including the masterball. Im that idiot that keeps convincing myself to save these stupid pp restorative items. I keep telling myself to save them for the elite four + champion, but I never end up using them(In the older games with limited inventory space I would deposit them into the pc.). Im also still waiting for gamefreak to allow us to buy them in game(No not the masterball the eithers and elixirs). 
        I'm fond, in more recent generations, of just farming a heckton of Leppa Berries, because they're renewable and save the same purpose.  With berry farming getting easier and more plentiful, it's easy enough to keep a few hundred Leppas in your inventory and be set for life.

Also Oran/Sitrus/Lum for good measure, because even if I can buy items that do the same thing, well, these ones are free (though I do keep a few hyper potions for in-battle healing).
        I've literally never used those things, thinking that I won't be able to buy them again. I just go to a PMC when I needed PP restoration. Only time I've ever used a max revive was clutching against Steven's mega metagross lol

            Thank you I needed that! I got a good chuckle out of it. 
    This is me with literally everything in pokemon. Had many playthroughs where I haven't used any items in battle (potions etc) because what if there's a time I *really* need them (and the elite 4 isn't that time for some reason...)
    I always save it on the offchance I come across a shiny which might have a move like Self Destruct or Explosion.

Those are the times you just yeet that sucker.
    Me with any limited resource in a video game 
    I always use the master ball on the regional dragon that I know will be my star Pokémon
Fucking pleb; Premier Ball or bust.
    Luxury Ball*
        Luxury Ball Shiny Rayquaza is best Rayquaza.


        I thought I was the only one.
"BUT WHAT IF I FIND A SHINY WITH A LOW CATCH RATE?!"
    "But what of I find a shiny geodude that can self-destruct!?"
        My first shiny was a shiny Graveler in SS.  Yup.  The first one I caught was a shiny Woobat
            Played every gen but my first shiny encounter was a Steelix in Gen 4. Unfortunately, the guy with his Lucario was with me and I couldn’t kill off his Lucario before he killed Steelix. Siiiiiigh. 
                I've played since '98 and didn't see a single shiny until XY. Then I suddenly got like 10 of them. 
                    Same! First game was Yellow. First random encounter shiny was Vanillite. Lame shiny..
                        No way, so was mine! I named it Strawberry. It was in a Horde Battle in Frost Cavern. 

But shortly after that, I bred a shiny Vulpix and caught a shiny Marill, so that was rad.
                            Mine was in a hoard battle too!
                                I guess they're twins

What did you name yours?
                                    I didn’t lol. I only really name my starters and main party members. 
                        Aw I love shiny vanillite! I got a random encounter one too. I just think vanillite is really cute though, and I love pink/purple shinies so I’m a bit biased. 
                    Gen VI increased the Shiny rate from 1/8192 to 1/4096.
            First shiny I ever saw was a shiny graveler in pokemon diamond. It self destructed, Back then I didn't know what a shiny was, but I knew it different and wanted to catch it. Second was a shiny bidoof before I had any pokeballs. Caught a shiny ponyta in an emulator though. Still haven't got one in a legit pokemon game.
            My first was a surskit in my now-lost copy of Emerald, and my second legit shiny was a masquerain in Moon. I like to think he grew up and found me again.
            At least you’ve encountered a shiny. I’ve been playing Pokémon since I was like 8 (I’m 20 now) and I’ve never once encountered a shiny that wasn’t given to you by the game- or an event Pokémon in Pokémon Go. I live a sad shiny-less life 
                Ditto with me. Every gen, never met a wild shiny
            I caught him in 3 ultras one time. 
            That reminds me of Chuggaconroy's story of his friend
                Who is Chuggaconroy?
    I've never even come across a shiny in any of my games. Except for Red Gyrados, but that doesn't count.
        If you rly care you could chain, but it ruins the magic
[or manipulate the RNG to catch it in a Pokéball, at full hp](https://youtu.be/RnockqlvNEc?t=7794)
    Freakin madlad
    I just keep whipping regular Pokéballs until it's caught lol
    Wait, so just because his health is low and he waits a certain amount of time it works every time
        The catch rate is determined by the HP, Status, Ect of the pokemon you're trying to catch, but the actual random number used is based on *your* pokemon and play time.

By using a pokemon at a specific level of HP, and throwing the pokeball at a specific time, he controls exactly what number's going to come up on the capture roll so it doesn't matter what the catch rate is as long as it's above 0.
    Theres no guide on how to  do that though only on how to rng abuse pokemon to be shiny or have good iv.
I've recently downgraded to pokeball only runs because I apparently hate myself.
    I do that too. They’re just aesthetically pleasing. I catch my Legendaries and shinies in balls that match their colours, and if nothing matches, I use Luxery balls  
        I love the look of premier balls so I try to catch my favorites in those, I caught Groudon in a premier ball in OR and I think I was happy without interruption for a solid week from the hype.
        Same here, but I do use standard balls for legendaries as well. All of my legendaries are in standard pokeballs.

I also soft reset for natures, IVs, and for certain pokemon even HP typings. Took me a week or so to catch Tapu Lele with with HP fire in a pokeball.

I hate myself.
            Weird flex but okay
                Not weird at all...
                    >All of my legendaries are in standard pokeballs.  
>  
>I also soft reset for natures, IVs, and for certain pokemon even HP typings. Took me a week or so to catch Tapu Lele with with HP fire in a pokeball.

"I do everything you do but harder." And in the context of Pokemon, bragging about making the game harder for yourself is indeed a weird flex
    I’m so sorry
    I mean, why use P1200 for x2 catch rate when you can spend P200 twice for the same result? - /r/mathgore
        Because that's not how it works, two tries at 1 in 4 odds results in ~44% chance of the event occurring, one try at 1 in 2 odds is 50%.
            That's not really refuting his joke point though, because Pokeballs are still technically more economical here
                Only if your time is literally worthless.
                    Not really. Depending on the point of the game you're at, money can be tight if you're avoiding trainer battles
                        catching legendaries while avoiding trainer battles is a pretty niche playthrough.
                            this sounds like an average playthrough to me
        Lol you doing math, and my dumbass is like "these ones are prettier." ;;;
    It's not too bad if you weaken the pokemon properly. I've only ever caught 1 legendary in a masterball, the rest have been beastballs/pokeballs
I save it for Latios/Latias
That's no premier ball.
One of the dumbest things I do to make the game more challening is that I only use the totally regular pokeball, legendaries take hourssss.
Although, one time, merely as a joke I threw a regular pokeball at Palkia in the absolute FIRST round in Platinum and caught it!
    > legendaries take hourssss

Older legendaries, yeah (Real talk, Rayquaza took me ~7 hours in R), but I've found that the newer games make catching legendaries much easier.
        You're dead on. As an extreme example, GameFreak changed [Necrozma's catch rate](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Necrozma_\(Pok%C3%A9mon\)) from 3 in Sun/Moon, the lowest possible value, to 255 in US/UM--the highest possible value. It started, I think, in Black/White where catching Reshiram/Zekrom was required to progress the story. Since then--even when it's not mandatory--catching the box legendaries has been so easy even an 11 year old could do it.
        Yeah, I agree, I remember the good ol days of 5 hours of resetting and tossing out another 500 pokeballs.
    The first time I ever faced Rayquaza I caught it with a poke ball when it used fly
    The same thing happened to me! I only started doing my pokeball only runs in Gen 6 but back in Sapphire I think it was, I decided to try to catch Rayquaza with a normal pokeball and got it on the first turn with my first throw :)
I ran out of Ultras when I went after him in ORAS and switch to 99 Pokéballs, after 99 ultras and 97 tries with regulars I was definitely thinking I'd be going to soft reset but I finally caught him on the 98th Pokéball.
    I caught it with a pokeball in ORAS lmao
        The catch rate in ORAS is way higher than in RSE.
            Not according to that guy using 99 ultra balls lol
                Yeah I have no idea how that happened
    Wouldn't he have struggled to death before that many balls could be thrown?
        I am most definitely sure this story never happened. 
         I’m pretty sure that if he faints in ORAS, the battle restarts.
    I feel like I have better luck catching mons with Pokeballs than Great Balls or Ultra Balls tbh
        ultraballs are only ×2 from pokeballs, so its not that significant of a difference from pokeballs. 
    >Played every gen but my first shiny encounter was a Steelix in Gen 4. Unfortunately, the guy with his Lucario was with me and I couldn’t kill off his Lucario before he killed Steelix. Siiiiiigh.

I do most my playthroughs catching everything that doesn't run away in straight pokeballs or premier balls. I've chucked a lot of pokeballs at legendaries. I'm used to carrying several hundred at a once.
And then it’s bashful anyways. Try again 100x
I always just used my master ball on the roaming Lati-whatever
Or you could use a 500 pokeballs and then it flies away....
Ultra ball, unless its shiny then use master ball on your last pokemon.
I look best in luxury balls
    Yeah, but you get all of 2 of those in Gen III R/S/E
True masters only use pokeballs, the rest are just nubs.
Inventory:99 pokéballs, 99 pokéballs, 99 pokéballs, 9
99 pokéballs, 1 masterball
I was trying to catch Regirock for the first time and got frustrated so I tossed a couple other random balls and a Great ball did the job. 12 year old me thought this was a sign, I ended up catching Regice with an Ultra ball and you can see where this is going. I ended up catching Registeel after about 8 tries and 140 Poke balls. 

On subsequent playthroughs, I realized I was in fact a moron.
Ever since they added the whole pokeball animation when you throw it, I have to catch them in pokeballs only. 
    I forget what gen it was, but they showed what kind of pokeballs you caught your pokemon in when you viewed their stats (I think it was gen 3?)

&#x200B;

I switched right then. 
Use Timer Balls they are twice as effective as Ultra Balls after 8 rounds.

&#x200B;
You're not a real man until you catch him with an ultra ball 
    Your not a real man if you use anything other than pokeballs AND catch them first try. Honestly rayquaza wasnt hard to catch...
        He was when I was 11
            I remember how Raquaza kept killing itself through outrage confusion. THAT was damn annoying. 
Simple:

99 ultra balls for a regular Rayquaza

1 master ball for a Shiny Rayquaza
"Rayquaza used Outrage!"

&#x200B;

Me: \*resets\*
Freaking use Timer balls, they are amazing!
I don’t care how long it takes, I’m using a regular pokeball or nothing for legendaries. That’s what a true Pokémon master would do, or so I’ll keep telling myself 
    I haven't used anything other than regular Poke balls since Platinum. 
I would always save the master ball for Latios/Latias. Ain’t no way in hell i’m chasing that thing around
I caught rayquaza in Oras first try with a pokeball on accident 
    I did it with a quick ball (I.e. the most OP ball)
        The modern masterball
Still stupid luck that I caught Dialga with a Pokeball in 1 try when I was a kid. No idea how it all worked. I kept insisting my friends to do the same. 
I only use pokéballs. Gotta be OG
Timer Ball>Ultra Ball. 
Masterball > latias/latios
Caught him with a pokeball on my last try 
99 Ultra Balls
In ORAS I caught Deoxys on my second ultra ball. I was thrilled lol. 
Button 3: Use 999 pokeballs.
I'd keep the Master Ball for something like a shiny Teleport Ralts/Kirlia.
99 Ultra Balls is cheaper. You can't buy Master Balls, the replacement value is almost an entire extra playthrough then giving it to a Pokemon and trading it over. Buying more Ultra Balls just means at worst grinding for money for a bit.
For me it's 99 premiere balls 
I try and use Luxury Balls consistently if I’m gonna use it for VGC. Makes it a lot more difficult but I think they look much nicer 
I could swear by switching it up. Use a ultra then great then normal pokeball or some combination of pokeballs and you have much higher chance of catching the Pokémon than just throwing the same ball repeatedly 
Pokeballs then premiers and if those 198 balls fail onto the master ball
I just wish that Gen 3 had a sleeper. 
The key is to jus throw a regular pokeball right at the start of the encounter. I’ve caught many legendaries that way
more like saving right before and restarting over and over till you just catch it with an ultra at full health 
Its usually 99 Ultra ball fails, resort to pokeball, instant catch.
Neither. Pokéballs only.
Master balls are not only hideous, but always make me think something’s hacked when I see one.  I cannot abide allowing a Pokémon in my service to live in one. 
Ultra balls look cooler anyway
I swear back in the original Ruby and Sapphire, when ever Rayquaza used fly a pokeball was pretty much as good as a master ball while he was still up in the air. Every time I did it i caught it first try 
Listen up, you inexperienced greenhorn 

You either use straight Pokéballs

Or you use Dive balls
My favorite memories from Ruby was getting past the bike puzzle by button mashing out of frusturation on my 30th try, and then forgetting to save before facing rayquaza, realizing I only had 20 ultra balls and 99 pokeballs, and catching him on my last 3 pokeballs.
I save the master ball for Latios/Latias
 I messed up by forgetting to bring pokeballs when I finally got to the top of sky pillar, had only one regular pokeball to make things worse. For lulz I gave it a shot and actually caught the bastard. Best moment ever. 
Use poke or premiere only. I used it on either mewtwo or lunala, due to color effects~
Bruh....
Save the Masterball for Latios or Latias.
I always save mine for roaming pokemon. Its never even a question to me.

Except maybe platinum since the roaming pokemon are very easy to track
Always had to use that Master ball on Latias/ Latios
In my sapphire I caught Rayquaza with 1 pokeball after my kyogre's ice beam put it at 1 health and frozen.

I about spit out my cereal.
200 Luxury Balls is the actual best choice here.
Only true Pokemon trainers catch 'em all in Pokeballs
I always use the Masterball in emerald, because I'm not ready to catch him legitimately by the time I reach him, but I want to use him to stomp the Elite Four anyways.
Caught Rayquaza 1st try at full HP with a pokeball in omega ruby at work next to my co-worker friend. I joked with him "what if I got it first try lol" and threw it. 

I nicknamed him '1 THRO'
Rayquaza isnt in r/s though 
    Incorrect, Rayquaza can still be found at sky pillar in the games before emerald, although he didn't have any story significance as far as I know in the original Ruby and sapphire
        Ah I've had them all this time and never knew! Thanks
    Yes it is.

I'm fond, in more recent generations, of just farming a heckton of Leppa Berries, because they're renewable and save the same purpose.  With berry farming getting easier and more plentiful, it's easy enough to keep a few hundred Leppas in your inventory and be set for life.

Also Oran/Sitrus/Lum for good measure, because even if I can buy items that do the same thing, well, these ones are free (though I do keep a few hyper potions for in-battle healing).
I've literally never used those things, thinking that I won't be able to buy them again. I just go to a PMC when I needed PP restoration. Only time I've ever used a max revive was clutching against Steven's mega metagross lol

    Thank you I needed that! I got a good chuckle out of it. 
Luxury Ball Shiny Rayquaza is best Rayquaza.


I thought I was the only one.
My first shiny was a shiny Graveler in SS.  Yup.  The first one I caught was a shiny Woobat
    Played every gen but my first shiny encounter was a Steelix in Gen 4. Unfortunately, the guy with his Lucario was with me and I couldn’t kill off his Lucario before he killed Steelix. Siiiiiigh. 
        I've played since '98 and didn't see a single shiny until XY. Then I suddenly got like 10 of them. 
            Same! First game was Yellow. First random encounter shiny was Vanillite. Lame shiny..
                No way, so was mine! I named it Strawberry. It was in a Horde Battle in Frost Cavern. 

But shortly after that, I bred a shiny Vulpix and caught a shiny Marill, so that was rad.
                    Mine was in a hoard battle too!
                        I guess they're twins

What did you name yours?
                            I didn’t lol. I only really name my starters and main party members. 
                Aw I love shiny vanillite! I got a random encounter one too. I just think vanillite is really cute though, and I love pink/purple shinies so I’m a bit biased. 
            Gen VI increased the Shiny rate from 1/8192 to 1/4096.
    First shiny I ever saw was a shiny graveler in pokemon diamond. It self destructed, Back then I didn't know what a shiny was, but I knew it different and wanted to catch it. Second was a shiny bidoof before I had any pokeballs. Caught a shiny ponyta in an emulator though. Still haven't got one in a legit pokemon game.
    My first was a surskit in my now-lost copy of Emerald, and my second legit shiny was a masquerain in Moon. I like to think he grew up and found me again.
    At least you’ve encountered a shiny. I’ve been playing Pokémon since I was like 8 (I’m 20 now) and I’ve never once encountered a shiny that wasn’t given to you by the game- or an event Pokémon in Pokémon Go. I live a sad shiny-less life 
        Ditto with me. Every gen, never met a wild shiny
    I caught him in 3 ultras one time. 
    That reminds me of Chuggaconroy's story of his friend
        Who is Chuggaconroy?
If you rly care you could chain, but it ruins the magic
The catch rate is determined by the HP, Status, Ect of the pokemon you're trying to catch, but the actual random number used is based on *your* pokemon and play time.

By using a pokemon at a specific level of HP, and throwing the pokeball at a specific time, he controls exactly what number's going to come up on the capture roll so it doesn't matter what the catch rate is as long as it's above 0.
I love the look of premier balls so I try to catch my favorites in those, I caught Groudon in a premier ball in OR and I think I was happy without interruption for a solid week from the hype.
Same here, but I do use standard balls for legendaries as well. All of my legendaries are in standard pokeballs.

I also soft reset for natures, IVs, and for certain pokemon even HP typings. Took me a week or so to catch Tapu Lele with with HP fire in a pokeball.

I hate myself.
    Weird flex but okay
        Not weird at all...

"I do everything you do but harder." And in the context of Pokemon, bragging about making the game harder for yourself is indeed a weird flex
Because that's not how it works, two tries at 1 in 4 odds results in ~44% chance of the event occurring, one try at 1 in 2 odds is 50%.
    That's not really refuting his joke point though, because Pokeballs are still technically more economical here
        Only if your time is literally worthless.
            Not really. Depending on the point of the game you're at, money can be tight if you're avoiding trainer battles
                catching legendaries while avoiding trainer battles is a pretty niche playthrough.
                    this sounds like an average playthrough to me
Lol you doing math, and my dumbass is like "these ones are prettier." ;;;
You're dead on. As an extreme example, GameFreak changed [Necrozma's catch rate](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Necrozma_\(Pok%C3%A9mon\)) from 3 in Sun/Moon, the lowest possible value, to 255 in US/UM--the highest possible value. It started, I think, in Black/White where catching Reshiram/Zekrom was required to progress the story. Since then--even when it's not mandatory--catching the box legendaries has been so easy even an 11 year old could do it.
Yeah, I agree, I remember the good ol days of 5 hours of resetting and tossing out another 500 pokeballs.
The catch rate in ORAS is way higher than in RSE.
    Not according to that guy using 99 ultra balls lol
        Yeah I have no idea how that happened
I am most definitely sure this story never happened. 
 I’m pretty sure that if he faints in ORAS, the battle restarts.
ultraballs are only ×2 from pokeballs, so its not that significant of a difference from pokeballs. 
He was when I was 11
    I remember how Raquaza kept killing itself through outrage confusion. THAT was damn annoying. 
The modern masterball
Ah I've had them all this time and never knew! Thanks
