[[A short synopsis on every game]]


Red/Blue: You run around bullying kids so you can go beat up adults and oust the champion from his full time job with your fire dragon

Gold/Silver: You have a really evil rival and team rocket fires probably gamma rays at every Pokémon ever giving them bad radiation poisoning but they look cool so it’s ok

Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald: You find out that these evil teams with no ability to color coordinate orbs have woken up literal terraforming monsters because.... reasons?

FR/LG: It’s like gen 1 but with gen 3’s trumpets 

Diamond/Pearl/Platinum: Once again an evil team with evil agendas and an evil leader has awoken the gods of time and space but if you are playing the other game he awakens a demonic reality destroying deathly dimension beast 

HG/SS: It’s like gen 2 with more legendaries

Black/White: Some vegans with a castle are protesting so you kidnap their king and beat up his dad for having a different opinion 

Black 2/White 2: it’s like Black and White except with better cover art and the vegans are pirates now

X/Y: There was a war and a sad guy so go catch this deer

OR/AS: It’s like gen 3 but with more rayquaza and more VGC players in eternal pain

Sun/Moon: There are no more gyms only infestations here have a Pokémon and play exterminator for a whole game while we handhold you for no reason 

US/UM: It’s like gen 7 but with more abominations

LGP/LGE: It’s like gen one with more cute

Sword/Sheild: Your friend has depression and you have to continually beat up his mediocre team so you can stop the president from beating the champion before you do


Gen 1: wasn’t the champion your rival who just got there?

ORAS: At least they figured out how to color coordinate the orbs
    Wait, I don't remember that part of ORAS too well. Did they actually have the right orbs this time? I remember thinking it was so funny that they got it wrong in the originals.
        Yeah, the right orbs are what let them use Primal Reversion. The wrong ones just piss them off
            Correction 

The wrong ones pisses them off.

The correct ones pisses them off AND let's them use Primal Reversion
                Is that why they couldn’t do primal reversion in the originals? Because they got the orbs wrong?
                    Yep. Can't power up with the wrong item, of course.
                        Haha that means the error was on purpose!
                            Or they just fucked it up and came up with a cool/broken reason to fix it in the remakes
                                Which is a pretty cool retcon as far as retcons go
                                    Is it a retcon? Nothing about ORAS disproves anything in R/S, it doesnt day “that was wrong” it just says “this also is a thing” so it’s not really a retcon, more an expansion to plot
                                Maybe Maxie and Archie can't tell the difference between red and blue
                                    Fun fact: Everyone in the Pokemon universe is colorblind.
                                I thought the opposite orbs was intentional.
                    I think its because of what Zenna explains in the Post Game of OR/AS>!where the are basically two different "realities" - one without all the crazy transformation and travel stuff where the OG games primarily take place in which the Ultimate Weapon didn't get fired and very little came from outside the planet other than Deoxys, then the Universe where the Ultimate Weapon did get fired and all that stuff from space landed on the planet creating all the transforming craziness, altered forms etc. of Pokemon in which the new games take place.!<
                        I’d love to see them expand on this idea
                            They sort of did in USUM to fix up any more plot holes going with like, >!infinite realities/timelines exist, and Team Rainbow Rocket you defend the USUM timeline from, but then Giovanni backs off and decides to try and conquer other realities!<
                                I kinda totally forgot about this actually, despite having played through it. USUM feels like so long ago with how much controversy SWSH have strummed up
                            I’m playing through Glazed right now and, while not canon at all, it explores this idea a bit. You switch between the Pokémon universe and our actual universe, where Pokémon is just a video game.
                                In several Pokemon games, Pokemon is a game. In FireRed and LeafGreen, they literally advertise the very games you are playing in the department store.
                                    Sure, but I mean you travel between the two realities in this one and in one, there are cars and dogs and shit, like real life.
                                I’m pretty sure that’s just Digimon.
                                    Don’t do this to me haha
                                Really that is cool
                                That sounds sick, I’ve only played a couple Pokémon ROM Hacks, I need to take a deep dive into it some time soon
                                    I need to play more. I’ve done this one and one that is from the perspective of team rocket. Both are pretty solid. A good rom hack gives you that nostalgia as well as something a little fresh.
                        I’m glad I’m not the only one who remembers this.
                ^('the ones' is plural, so it's 'the correct ones piss them off', like in the comment you responded to.)
                    God damn it. I wrote it like that originally but thought it looked wrong so I changed it lol
            I actually thought that was very clever but I have no idea if it was intentional or not
                did you make your account on opposite day
        Canonically both games take place in separate timelines. In 1 timeline mega stones exist and in the other they don’t
            Yeah I knew that. I just didn't remember them getting the orbs right in the other "timeline". I definitely need to play the games again.
            > In 1 timeline mega stones exist and in the other they don’t

More accurately would be that in 1 timeline mega stones are a common item and in the other are an exclusivity for Kalos
    Technically Lance was the champion in gen 1, but your rival beat him to become the champion right before you got there.
        So wouldn't that mean while Lance was champion the Elite 4 was Loreli, Bruno, Agatha, and a fourth person we've never met? I wonder who that person was?
            My name is John, and I'm the old elite 4 normal type leader.

I got kicked out
                At least you can take the Viridian gym now that Giovanni is gone- no wait that kid took it
                    And that’s why he moved to Hoenn!
                        Nah, that was because of the divorce.
                    Maybe Giovanni was the old elite four member. Not responsible for maintaining the gym anymore, he committed more time to team rocket until your rival beats him, then becomes champion, which makes Lance the 4th member and sends Giovanni back to his gym. Perhaps the gym is locked before because they were still trying to find a new leader since Giovanni became part of the elite four?
                        Not possible - how could Blue have got the 8th badge when there was no leader in Veridian?
                            But we don’t know how long ago Blue got his eighth badge. Do we?
                                Can’t have been that much before Red. Blue and Red are hot on each other’s heels throughout the game. Giovanni wasn’t even back in Veridian that long before Red returned there and there was no gym leader there until Giovanni got back. Hence Blue could not have progressed to fight the Elite 4 until Giovanni was back.
                Hey, John. Screw you and your broken ass gen1 Tauros
                Just couldn’t give up the sauce, could ya, John?
                    I almost beat him! But my Tauros missed the final hit :(
            I feel like if there was a fourth member then we’d see him running out crying as we walk into the Pokémon league cause your rival beats lance literally right before you get there. Like lance is spamming his Pokémon with full restores when you walk in
                In Pokemon canon though aren’t pokemon supposed to have feelings and fatigue and stuff. 

So isn’t the rival beating Lance literally the second before we get there just him loosening the pickle jar for us?

Also wouldn’t Lance and the other elite 4 have also worked down the rival before we get there.
                    You underestimate the Elite four’s power to spam full restores
            There was no champion, only elite 4 members. Because both Red and Blue beat them, they battled each other for the Champion title.
                yeah i agree, there is no real "champion", just a person who defeated the elite four. then the next person to defeat the elite four has to battle the current champion for the title. its not like a job or anything.
                    In a few of the games, being Champion is absolutely a job. Especially in the Unova Region, where it seems like the League has Political and Law Enforcement responsibilities, beyond simply running their gyms and testing trainers.
                        Yeah, this came to mind after I just finished Ultra Sun last night. So you are the first champion of Alola and Hau already wants to challenge you again. There could be other challengers as well and you cannot really know when they will come. What if you took off to another region other than Alola? The planet can't be 4 islands can it?
            Maybe Karen or Will?
                I think will would make the best sense since psychic was around for Red and Blue while Dark was added later
                    Imagine a gen 1 psychic E4... Nightmares.
            Yeah. The old fourth member got kicked out for racist tweets he made in 09
                and for that jinx-face in 04
                Blame it on the ambien.
            I'm pretty sure it was mentioned that Lance was the fourth member and he was the champion, but because Blue beat him, there were now five members, the Elite 4 and the Champion.
                It started as just laurelei deciding she was the champion, then Bruno beat her and became the champion and she was the elite trainer.. Then Agatha beat them both and became the champion, and they were the elite Duo.. And so on
                    Ah, the reverse Bink's Sake
            Giovanni, maybe? Not only is he the next strongest gym trainer, but it would also explain why he was away at first.
                Wasn't he away because he was running the pokemafia? Seems unlikely that he was a gym leader, elite 4 and mob boss.
                    That'd be an impressive resumé though
                    Hell, he could become potus.
                        ...now I want a Pokémon game set in the United States

... during the Civil War
                            Native Americans riding ponytas and tauros. Fuck yeah.
                Damn, I just left a whole theory about this in this thread too.
            Oh my god it’s been twenty years and I never noticed this. It’s literally the only gen where it happens. That’s so weird and it’s going to bug me forever now.
                I always imagined the Elite 4 were the same as they are in the game, and the Champion before Blue was someone else, possibly his own grandfather.
                    Professor Oak wasn't the Champion before Blue. Remember, "I came when I *heard* you'd beaten the Elite Four."

Whoever Blue beat to become Champion wasn't his grandfather, because Blue is Champion before Oak hears about it.
                        Right, never mind.
                Nah, happens in the Alola games too, except you’re the first champion and have to defend your title immediately.
            No lance was a part of the elite four, there just hadn’t been anyone who managed to clear the gauntlet before blue yet. In GSC Lance does become champion, but not necessarily because red leaves. He took on the new elite four to become champion himself. I guess Lorelei left and he saw his chance 😂
        I’m pretty sure the title was vacant which was why he was the 4th member of the elite 4
        The way they made it sound was that Blue was the first person to beat the Elite 4 and became the first ever Champion. Meaning there was no champion before.
            Or maybe there was but the last one chose not to defend his/her title for some reason.
        No, there was no champion. He was just the last member of the elite 4.
            That makes most sense.
        And then you meet Red, who could’ve dick slapped Lance and your rival at the same time
            You are Red in Gen 1.
        Source?
        Nope. Even at the start of the game, if you check Oak's computer in his lab, it shows the E4 was newly formed and is hosting the gym challenge to decide a champion
            If that’s true, the mystery is solved.
        Lance was never Kanto's champion
    WHAT ABOUT YELLOW BRUH
        Wasn't it the same in yellow? Blue was champion?
XY: go catch a deer or the **living embodiment of death**
    Or bacon
        Ah yes, shiny yveltal
            Correction, it's YAVELTAL GOD OF DARKNESS AND DEATH
                Ah yes, pokemon talk. What the fuck happened to the floor?
                    It got killed by the floor tenticals
                        There's some conspiracy theory going on that says the floor tentacles were made by some foreign Dragonite
                        FUCK THATS HOT SH*T SH*T SH*T
                Ah, I see you are a man of culture as well
                    Yes I am
                I JUST WANTED TO IMPRESS PEOPLE
                    Bröther
                I mean, bacon should be dead too.
                I absolutely hate this sentence cuz of the recent controversies so.....

**yvetal ha ha**
                    Please elaborate
                        I also require elaboration.
                            I believe he means 'Yveltal' to potentially trigger the ManjTV fans who say 'Yahvaltal', but I am not entirely 100% sure myself.
                                Not trigger the fans, I just don’t really like Michael anymore after the recent controversies. Hold on let me get the explanation:

Jubilee lied about other YouTubers defending a pedophile over a year ago. Everyone involved in the situation told Jubilee she was lying and she doubled down at first. Michael retweeted/liked her statements. In his apology, for the both of them, admitted to doing wrong but didn’t admit that from the beginning they were lying for no reason. Now people are trying to claim Jubilee is controlling Michael and forcing him to say and do these things. However Michael has a long history of agreeing with the comments Jubilee makes for years at this point. So in the end, there is no one did more than the other. They both are in the wrong and still have not fully acknowledged that.
                                    Thanks for the elaboration friend
                                *my name*

*is yahvaltal*

But jokes aside I guess that makes sense.
                I see you are a man of culture as well
        Bacon bat
        Toothpaste deer and bacon bird are my favorite nicknames for legendaries ever.
            I read it as toothpaste deer and was like Xerneas looks like a toothpaste?

Then I remembered Zygarde lmao
    Sometimes I wonder which he came first...

Then I remember that the enemys tried to use a deer of LIFE to kill everything...
        I took it as the machine doing the killing using Xerneas as a power source. It's like, in my mind stealing energy from Xerneas for a power source is like making a philosopher's stone in FMA. It's "life energy" but goddamn is it a horrible evil thing to do and you're gonna cause a lot of destruction when you wield that energy. Plus, you know, the whole immortality thing. I dunno, the comparison makes it work for me.
            This was my interpretation as well.
        It’s my personal headcanon that if team Flare had successfully fired the ultimate weapon using Xerneas’ power then it would have had the opposite effect they intended, granting eternal life to the whole world. By stopping team Flare, you denied the world immortality and a chance at a perfect utopia and have become the ultimate villain without even realizing it.
            Ehh, eternal life can be a curse as well. There's a SCP where everything on earth is cursed to never die. Its gets real fucking shitty, cause eternal life doesn't mean eternal healing
                Of course it's a curse, look at AZ and how much he suffered wandering the world for 3000 years, and its not like he is some cryptid, people know of him they just choose to ignore him.
                Can you link the SCP? I want to read it!
                    https://youtu.be/9dLYnrXrjss

This is how I found about it, pretty sure he has a link to it if you just want to read
            Eternal Life = Overpopulation
                Only if it passes down genetically. You just have to watch your children die while you live forever.
            Trust me. Eternal life would be more of a distopia for the majority of people.
        To be fair in Y they use a soul-devouring evil bacon bird of death instead.
    I never played X: does Xerneas come from some ominous demon egg the same way Yveltal does?
        No, Xerneas cutscene is it transforming..... from a tree. Cuz that’s what it does, for some reason.

*weird fairy tree*
            Tree of Life. It is somewhat surprising how easy it can be to miss.
                It not being a grass type helps
                    It's basically the same as the deer God thing from Princess Mononoke.
                    It really should be. Grass is weak to Flying, Dark is weak to Fairy, it would make them more even
                        It would also help make it not stupidly broken in VGC as well. Giving it a 4x weakness + fire and flying would make Geomancy not seem as op.
            What is it with this game and things that look like trees but aren't trees
                Pseudo

Wood

Oh
                    Bonsai + Lie
                        Or bon-Sly
                            Bons-lie
                        Holy fuck
                        No. Way.
                    Also the ninja kids in Ruby/Sapphire who hide behind cardboard cutouts of trees
                        i loved that so much back then. still love it today
    I like how some Pokémon are fun and playful, some are quirky creatures, then you have stuff like giratina (basically satan) and darkrai (nightmare demon). 

oh and the creepy ones like hypno and drifloon..
        [deleted]
            the legendaries have crazy entries in general, most of them sound terrifying.
        I wouldn't call Giratina satan. Its more likely he was banished for his world warping powers, to the distortion would so he be of no harm to the world Arceus created. Maybe its just a personal head cannon but hey.
            giratina isn’t satan, it’s just the Pokémon equivalent.

it was banished for being too violent, and it’s the “renegade” Pokémon. Satan was banished for pride not violence but both were banished for abuse of power (just in different ways).

Giratina is more of the “rouge rebel” Pokémon than the “satan” Pokémon but satan is pretty much the embodiment of rebellion and defiance.

You’re right, they’re not the same. but they share a ton of similarities.
                no, giratina is neither satan, nor it's pokémon equivalent

it also wasn't violent, it caused harm to spacetime by it's mere existence, so it was was stored away safely into another reality where it couldn't cause any harm to the real world.

also, satan was not banished for pride but for opposing the evil sky dictatos decree. not out of pride, but out of a sense of justice. or maybe i'm confusing him with melek taus. i do get their stories mixed up at times.
                    yes it was violent, it’s literal Pokédex entry is:
“It was banished for its violence. It silently gazed upon the old world from the Distortion World.”

God banished Satan because “wickedness found him” and he later says “Your heart became proud on account of your beauty, and you corrupted your wisdom because of your splendor. So I threw you to earth; I made a spectacle of you before kings.” 

satan was banished for pride and corruption. 

* both rebels
* both banished 
* both are made from god and punished for their nature

there is no “satan” Pokémon but giratina is the closest example. If it’s not the equivalent, then what is? 

It’s the “renegade” Pokémon and satan was the first renegade in Christian beliefs.
    if it’s any consolation, competitive players see the deer as the living embodiment of death
        **geomancy intensifies**
            That's a nice deer you got there. Sure would be a shame if some paintbrush sloth gave it Grass typing.
                Not that saying it looks like a sloth is untrue, but if you mean Smeargle it's based on a beagle dog, hence the name
                    I legitimately didn't know that. Thank you for enlightening me to the existence of Paintbrush Snoopy.
                        No problem! I think the fact that there's always more to learn about the Pokemon world is what made it so interesting to me as a kid
    *laughs in Shedinja*
    YAHVELTALL, GOD OF DEATH!
        Ah a fellow individual of culture I see
            A fellow MandJTV fan I see
    I read up to x/y and figured the top comment would be addressing that and Im glad it did.
    New fone who dis?
    The fact that they didn’t explore DEATH ITSELF being a Pokemon in X/Y is another reason why those games are just... just the worst.
Didn't Cyrus want to straight up erase the world and start a new one?
    That's a straight up mood
        You know you have issues when you agree with Cyrus … and Lysandre … I need help.
            What did Lysandre do? Hate bad fashion?
                Want to murder 90% of the human population and 100% of Pokémon.
                    If I somehow existed in a pokemon world and someone wanted to kill all of the pokemon they would have to start with me. Pokemon being real is my wildest fantasy and if I got it I would defend it.
                Lysandre read a lot of Ayn Rand in college and just ran with it
                    Holy fuck this is funny 

But looking at the state of the world today, he’s not wrong
                I think he was Pokemon’s Thanos.
                    But with crappier motivations
            Just shoot the planet with a giant space laser. It's not like it can get any worse.
                he was mad xy was left unfinished
        This timeline fucking sucks
    Yeah
    I'm pretty sure he also summons Giratina by accident in Platinum, he intends to summon both Dialga *and* Palkia instead of just one, but doing so poses enough of a threat to the world that Giratina interferes.
    And he is only 27.
    And then he just fucks off to Giratina's world
    Lysander wanted to do the same but for some reason people hate him more...
Smh
    Same
    Cyrus wanted to pull a Thanos
Omg this bothers me so much. You are called team MAGMA, you wear RED, you want to control a pokemon that is RED and makes the SUN more HOT. Ah yes, the blue orb is the right one, for sure
    I mean I *sort of* get their logic. Maybe they were thinking that the opposite Orb, being the one representing the other legendary, would be the one that would cause their desired legendary to back down and obey. Maybe they figured the corresponding orb would make them more powerful and cause them to get out of control.

Still dumb of them, but I kinda get it.
        I think it has something to do with the lines in their bodies. Kyogre has red lines, Groundon in most art has black but I think originally it was a dark blue. The orb probably charged the lines or something like that.
            True, but even then, the patterns on the orbs were the same patterns on the corresponding legendary. You think they'd make that connection at least.
                The pattern only existed in ORAS. [In RSE/the anime](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Red_Orb#Appearance), it was literally just a red orb with nothing on it. However, reading the bulbapedia post, Team M/A actually did grab the wrong orb. I guess I was wrong all this time. I played Sapphire so long ago, I could've sworn the old couple said both orbs were needed and Archie only grabbed one.
        They were right on that logic, but were several years early.
        Well, the matching orbs did end up doing that.
        Even more confusing is Team Aqua trying to raise the sea level, even though their base isn't even flood proof, nor do they have more than one submarine.
Also how do you breath underwater?
        I always think this. 

Since I want to capture Kyogre, I need something to weaken it, not the orb to make it stronger. So, the orb of its rival.

Little did they know what they ultimately want is the trio master.
    "Groudon was in the cave because SOMEONE used the wrong orb and pissed him off."

\-Jaiden
    Blue fire is more hot than red fire so maybe that confused them
        They just big Azula fans
    Literal Bruh moment
    They must’ve watched the anime before going through with their plans
    I figured it was to make Groudon awaken because he smelt Kyogre's ball in his house.

If he just smelt his own ball he'd stay asleep.
SM: A thirsty widow wants to clap some interdimensional aliens’ cheeks

And USUM: YOUR cheeks get clapped by an interdimensional alien
    * ULTRA NECROZMA THEME PLAYS AGGRESSIVELY *
        Vietnam flashbacks intensify
            I actually want to praise the director USUM. It's like he heard that the fans were complaining about the games being too easy and had a field day with it.
                And then they removed him and had Ohmori back for Sword and Shield so it became too easy again.
        Best theme ever
            I agree
    I only beat ultra Necrozma because my Pokémon's affection to me was so high that two of them lived on 1hp, so I was able to defeat it on the first try.
        See, I had Pokémon from another game and another language so already they're getting x1.7 experience. Combine that with the experience boost from affection and Rotom-Lotto I was so overlevelled for Ultra Necrozma I took it down in two or three hits.
        i did something similar. i used a honchkrow with full affection and a focus sash(which you can get from one of the trainers at Poni Poni Island) and let it take a hit which dropped it to 1hp and used haze to eliminated the boosted stats, which then i took it out with two hits.
            Similar Plan. Had a Focus Sash Incineroar use Devastating Drake after surviving Power Gem, then had a Noivern live one HP to give Dragon Pulse,and Swampert dodge Prismatic Laser to give Earthquake. the last 2 were Affectionate, and I relished that Saturday Morning.
        I just found that my decidueye’s Z-move was over-powered against it, so I also beat it first try.
    I laughed much harder than I expected at this
    Can confirm on that last statement. One of the rare times I lost to something in the story.
    Not a widow; divorcee
    I only won because I just happened to have the perfect make shift counter ready. I opened with my vikavolt and taught it a paralysis TM before the match started while holding a focus sash. So it survived with 1hp left before firing off a thunder wave giving my team barely enough opportunities to do some damage and finally win.
    She's not a widow. Her ex moved away to own his own archipelago.
    So... SMUSUM is basically the Area 51 raid?
Are... are we the bad guys?
    Do we have skulls on our caps?
        Happy cake Day!
            Thanks man! Damn another year I didn’t even realize!
        Am I the man behind the slaughter?
        Happy skull cap day!
        Happy cake day!
    You figured that out now?
        I mean, we are the “bad ones” when it comes to individual people in the story but I never thought of us being the bad ones in the whole story. Would make for a great post game: consolidate your power and recruit your followers.
            We don’t really have any motivation other than being powerful though

We just happen to stop whatever scheme is afoot and don’t really have any ideology
                We choose to though and the main story can allow you to make those choices. Or it can be the same as a school bully - just for the power.
    *imagine the astronaut looking at earth meme*

Always have been
    “Hi there wanna see my bugs I just caught?”

“TASTE FIRE, PEASANT!!!!!!”

Yes... I believe so.
    We're more like anti-heroes. We're not great but we're better than the terrorists, cults and corporations.
SM had me rolling. "There are no gyms, only infestations"
The general summary is that a 11-18 year old is more competent than the police or the Pokeworld equivalent.

Also the rivals are kids with usually cool or shitty parents. Like 4 rivals have neglectful or abusive parents who are leaders of evil organizations. (Giovanni, Ghetsis, Lusamine and Rose).
    Oh my God! That's how we solve this whole police problem! Just give children dangerous monsters and everything will be okay!
        Didn't Americans recently discover that the answer to school shootings is to have guns in schools? Seems like the right direction
            The one upside to 2020, school shootings are way down
                *about to shoot myself in front of my class over zoom*

heh, keep tellin yourself that kid
                    You ok?
                        No, I miss being shot at so much that I'm shooting myself
    I mean recent games *literally* have Interpol hiring you because they're incapable of doing the job on their own.
    Wait, Rose is Hop's dad?
        He is Bede’s adoptive dad or something 

Basically the edgy rivals tend to have shit parents.
            Wait, Rose is Bede's adoptive son?
                Pretty sure it's the other way around (Oleana ad Bede are both "adopted" by Rose, but not like really adopted, he just gave them both a place to be and a purpose).
                Well, Rose just really endorsed Bede for the gym challenge because he saw good potential. They’re not related or anything.
        No no the slightly better rival
    On god Officer Jenny been caught lackin for over 20 years now
        The only thing she can catch is a Brock
            And a Squirtle. But then she just gives it to you
    If you think about it, Leon in S&S is you in every other game. Maybe there’s no evil team in Galar because he took care of them already, and he was the one who (tried to) take care of Eternatus
        See, this take is why I really like the idea of what they were going for in S&S. And the fact that they didn't trust a young teenager to solve the world's problems. Simply mind-blowing idea, that young teenagers may be unfit for entrusting the future of the world with.
            I get that, I really do. But the sudden break away from this weird unrealistic thing they've been doing since the very first game was itself bizarre. At least add something else in its place if you're going to strip it out!
I feel like the real plot of BW gets misunderstood by a good amount of people. Ghetsis never truly believed the "liberate pokemon" ideal. He just needed everyone to think that he did and he raised N to believe it too so there wouldnt be any doubts from anyone. Once people released all of their pokemon, we would use the legendary pokemon to take over Unova, since everyone would be left defenseless without pokemon to fight with.
    PETA but they backstab everyone
        So PETA
            I've heard a conspiracy that PETA is actually funded by meat productors to make vegans/animal rights activists look ridiculous

Not gonna lie I wouldn't be surprised lol
                I love your flair
                I don't know about that, but the meat industry actually does a lot of work to spread shit about them. PETA does do some sketchy campaigns from time to time like blatant sexualisation of women, but also have a lot of accomplishments to their name on areas like animal testing.
    Ghetsis is very much a cult leader
    So it's supporting the second amendment?
        The right to bear mons
            *I deserve the right to own as many Ursarings, Beartics, and Bewears in my house*
        Pretty much. To swap out Pokemons for guns in the plot, Team Plasma was protesting that no one should have guns at all, which Ghetsis pushed so that only he and those he trusted would have guns to make the general populace easier to control. Any benevolence regarding the removal of guns from the general populace was merely a front.
            Wait... is this what Americans think of gun control?
            Sounds like the radical left in America.  (Before you start down voting, I said the *radical* left, not the normal left, of which I hope most of you are.)
Isle of Armor: You get bootleg Kung-Fu Panda and fight an old guy who is secretly swole. Also you either get a toxic self-centred asshole or a toxic punny asshole as a rival.
    You fight King Bumi from ATLA
        this... is a perfect comparison
    He's an alternative universe Master Roshi.
    I looked at Klara as more of the person that will murder you in your sleep if piss her off
        The way she applies pressure to her Poke Ball makes me anxious...
    I mean, say what you want, I loved the rivals. They were honestly funny to see, they were basic, but charming, kinda like gen 5 rivals
        I second that opinion.
    At least 1 has a good song
These were all perfect but BW/BW2 were on a whole other level of on point
    Goddam pirate vegans
        At least they don’t have to worry about getting scurvy
            Scraggy on the other hand
    I don't think Ghetsis was just "having a different opinion" though
        He was also a horribly abusive and manipulative father, so we weren't kidnapping his son as much as we were acting of behalf of CPS, which unsurprisingly, don't seem to exist in the world of Pokemon.
        Nah, he was a straight up terrorist especially in BW2.
            He went from cult leader to terrorist
Sword/shield: your neighbor didn't get loved by his parents as a child so he has brother issues and the chairman decides at 11:59:59 of the game he's evil for no reason and apparently the entire region has run out of energy.
    Not even. The region will run out of energy in 1000 years if he doesn't interrupt your championship battle with a minor inconvenience.
        The champion wanted the chairman to wait, but the chairman has a God complex. He's also an anti-villain with far more sympathetic goals than most villains in Pokemon.
            He just got too excited and did it early. Not a bad bone there in his body
                Rose isn’t really a bad guy, he’s an antagonist. People often cite that as a flaw, but personally I think it’s a good mix up from gen 6’s villain, which is the absolute worst. Pokémon villains have never been good, but some were actually threatening a little bit, however I do think not including a villain, and instead having a man whose trying to do good, even if he has some (unconfirmed) mental complex, is a decent twist, it’s not good, but at least it’s different
                    Yeah, I agree. He also encourages you to fix it, and wasn’t being malicious
    I assumed the chairman was going to be evil when I first saw him. No good person has that hairdo.

Also, I honestly thought Bede was an elderly lady until I met an actual elderly lady.
        No kidding, I'm still not completely certain if Bede is a boy or a girl
        >No good person has that hairdo.

Or those shorts. 😫
            The shorts honestly made me think...no villain would wear those shorts, maybe he's not the villain!
                Oleana was acting a little shifty and I assumed she was gonna backstab but nope, she's loyal to a fault to a crazy jolly man.
        Honestly he's an elderly lady at heart
        My character has that hair 🙃
    So he releases a giant space chicken to create renewable energy but it’s too powerful so you throw one pokeball at it and catch it instantly. 

Then later on two douche bags with stupid ass haircuts show up out of nowhere claiming to be sovereign rulers of Great Britain and because of this they’re allowed to pump steroids into random Pokémon and let them loose in all the gyms. Then you whoop their asses for the third time and they say “We’re soooooo sowwy pwease forgive us” and you just let them walk away. The End.
    Am I the only one that suspected the chairman from the instant he was introduced?

Like, you're too old to be a rival, you're not the champion, and you're introduced before the first gym badge as a major character? You're the big bad.
This made me laugh way harder than it should have.
    Favorite one is either BW2 or XY
        My favorite is XY by far
Gold/Silver: Team Rocket goes rogue without their boss and take over the Radio Towr, only to ask the listeners: "... ok now what?"
"It’s like gen 3 but with more rayquaza and more VGC players in eternal pain"

This is the funniest thing I have ever read and will ever read
Colosseum: You play as an older cool dude with a kickass motorcycle who steals other people's evil Pokémon with no repercussions. Also, some chick follows you around.

XD: Same as before, but you're probably the child of the former two.
    You forgot about getting attacked by a crazy disco addict with dance moves
        With arguably the best soundtrack in the whole game.
            With undeniably the **BEST** soundtrack in *every* game
    A chick you found in a potato sack who swears you a life debt. She’s literally Chewbacca.
    We need a new Colosseum installment on Switch. The hardware would take that kind of game to so many amazing places. . .

&#x200B;

Oh and also obligatory "the models in Colosseum/XD are still superior to the modern-day models used even in SW/SH."
    Criminally underrated games
How is it that Lysandre had such serious motives and still managed to look in the mirror and think that that look will help him be taken seriously. He really is the taserface of pokemon
    I think if his hair was a few shades darker he wouldn't look so obviously evil.
    French people, what you gonna do. You see what Napoleon wore? Whole of Europe thought he was the anti-christ.
Ultra Sun/Moon: The universal gimmick of the region that let's any pokemon use really strong moves, comes from broken peices of a legendary pokemon from space a long time ago.
The main antagonist, (who just so happens to be closely related to an edgy rival of yours) leads you to believe they are super good, but they are actually a bad guy who wants to harness the power of the legendary for themselves. But they failed and now said legendary is pissed and has become a stronger form. The Protagonist now has to climb a tall ass tower so they can beat it up at the top before everything is ruined. By the end you have successfully crushed your main rivals dream. Well done.

It's important to realize that there are differences in the story.
    oh shit
    Huh, well when you put it like that...
I wanna take a shot at summarizing the game!

Gen 1: you guys are getting stories?

Gen 2: Giovanni fucks?

Gen 3: these idiots are trying to flood the ocean! Hoenns already 70% water!

Gen 4: a man and his army of bowlcuts want to destroy the sinnoh region! But, in reality a guy with depression just wants to be left alone.

Gen 5: a bunch of knights try to free all Pokemon but, they really just wanna rule the world. Also,N is here.

Gen 5 and a half: I'm gonna freeze the earth!

Gen 6: this planet ain't beautiful enough. Time to start over.

Gen 7: men in black go to Hawaii!

Gen 8: ok. What if we start the end of the world, RIGHT NOW so we don't have to worry about it in the future.
    That “Gen 5 and a half“ part had me dying
Sword/shield: it's a sport
You forgot to mention the vegan's dad comes back for revenge using a giant lizard in B2/W2
    And uses stolen technology to merge his dragon with his son's dragon who's a good guy now (and literally saves you from getting impaled by icicles).
    A giant Frozen Chicken that he turns into a Turducken.
OR/AS: This time the evil teams get the orbs right. It makes things worse.
My favorite part was vegans with a castle
>Red/Blue: You run around bullying kids so you can go beat up adults are oust the champion from his full time job with your fire dragon

imagine thinking everyone picks charmander. squirtle squad wya
    Why would I ever pick a fire dragon when I could have a literal turtle TANK!
Justice for Giratina, Giratina did nothing wrong! Poor thing was only saving its siblings! >!maybe it ate Cyrus in the Distortion/Reverse realm/world, but was that so wrong?!<
I died with the descriptions for gen 5.
I lost my shit over the OR/AS summary; despite the fact I don’t fully know what put them in more pain, was it because of Primal forms?
    No.

It was because mega rayquaza
        Oh yeah... fuck that thing, I’ve fought it in USUM, and it’s the stuff of nightmares
        Both
Slight correction on Red/Blue:

You run around bullying kids so you can beat up adults and oust the champion from his full time job with your fire ~~dragon~~ flying.
    Charizard. A literal dragon. Nah fam he flying type.
SwSh and BW were hilarious but the disservice done to HGSS is painful. I guess it’s true in simplicity but the game is so much more than gen 2 w more legendaries imo
    Agreed! I’m totally biased cause I’m sentimental and it’s my fav game but to me they did a great job expanding the storyline, plus it’s the first game where you really get to interact with your Pokémon! Turning around and chatting to them always made me so happy :)
This gave me a much needed laugh. Thank you so much. I love all of it.
A synopsis of XY? Big Hero 6. XY is JUST Big Hero 6.
    And they're Gen 6

Coincidence?
        Big hero gen 6
B and W is both misleading and too accurate at the same time.
Looks like this guy used a charizard and played X version
Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon: THE BANE OF NUZLOCKE RUNS
Gen 1: You bully murderers who give you money. Who's the real criminal?
"The vegans are now pirates" is now my new favorite phrase.
Wait that's the origin of Shinies?
    Not really, alt-coloration is just a rare biological phenomenon, like irl albinism. However, the most famous shiny in the fandom, the Lake of Rage red gyarados (introduced in the plot precisely to showcase the new shiny feature), WAS a mutant that was forced to evolve with radio waves
        When you age prematurely
    It's the origin of the Lake of Rage red Gyarados.
        NeverplayedGoldandSilverbeforethankyouforexplaining
            You're missing out. Try HGSS.
                (Sad no DS noises)
                    You should try an emulator. HGSS is a masterpiece
                    (Happy emulator noises)
                        Does emulator work with BW and B2W2? Everyone seems to love those games
                            Depends on what emulator you are using. If you have an iPhone, for example, you could get NDS4ios. There are plenty of other options too.
                                I have OnePlus

Rip
                                    I bought DraStic for my Note 10 since free emulators didn’t work with some games. It’s worth the ~$5 imo.
> some vegans with a castle are protesting so you kidnap their king and beat up his dad for having a different opinion

So true, I never thought of it that way
    It’s not tho… :|

This [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/hguzcd/a_short_synopsis_on_every_game/fw6y81i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) summarizes it accurately.
        Ah, my mistake
Here is my version:

RB - Beat eight gyms, beat the mafia, beat the elite four

Y - Beat eight gyms, beat the mafia, beat the elite four.... but with a yellow electric mouse

GSC - Team Rocket is coming back, punish them and put them back down.

RS - Beat eco-terrorists from fucking up

E - Beat BOTH eco-terrorists from fucking up

DP - Beat space-loving terrorists from destroying reality

P- Beat space-loving terrorists from destroying reality.... and from using the power of Satan.

HGSS - Team Rocket is coming back, punish them and put them back down.... with dual screen

BW - Stop PETA

B2W2 - Stop PETA terrorists

XY - Stop a Worldicide maniac

ORAS - Beat eco-terrorists from fucking up.... IN 3D

SM - Something something Hawaii

USUM - Something something Hawaii.... also Rick and Morty

LGPLGE - Beat eight gyms, beat the mafia, beat the elite four.... now you can choose between a mouse and a fox on who gets to kill

SS - BRITISH PUNS
Very good here I'll do the GameCube games

Pokemon Colosseum: you play as an edgelord and your waifu girlfriend uses her mystical abilities to locate  abused Pokemon & S T E A L them from other trainers.

XD: it's like Pokemon Colosseum except the waifu is your sister and she was kidnapped but you get a sick scouter like in DBZ instead to detect the abused Pokemon
What are LGP/LGE?
    Let's Go Pikachu and Let's Go Eevee
    Figured it out: Let's go Pikachu/Let's go Eevee.
Wowee someone doesn't like sun and moon.
    I despise gen7
        I respectfully disagree, I love Sun and Moon.
            It’s just me I guess. The handholding mixed with the meh story and meh animations makes me not like it so much. Also I hated gen 7 VGC it was awful
                Yeah I don't follow the meta that much but I personally liked the story and characters. But yeah I definitely understand why a lot of people don't like it.
                    I guess the root of it all for me is the gen 7 meta
This.... this is perfect. 

Now rest as you have brought peace to a grateful universe.
I don’t see the synopsis for Pokémon Crystal...
    Same as GS but now theres a *probably* gay magician chasing the aurora wolf.
Hey, the vegan king is an abusive father
    And secretly eats veal.
For sword/shield don’t forget the random army of simps you have to keep beating up
Heres a Very Short Synopsis


Gen 1: Im better than you because i battled team rocket


Gen 2: EGG


Gen 3: Water. Earth. Fire. Air. My grandmother used to tell me stories about the old days, a time of peace when the Avatar kept balance between the Water Tribes

Gen 4: were evil so we want to destroy the world, but we cant kill people or cause terrorism, That would be WAY to evil, hey is that Giratina over yonder

Gen 5:So basically that guy N ya'know... he has plot relevancy

Gen 6: SPACE DEER VS BACON STRIP


Gen 7: No gyms only SUPER SYAIN

Gen 8: when bigger pokemon miss, they kill many peoples
I forgot how fucking stupid that whole old guy and his flower thing were in X and Y
    And the game has the gall to try to demand we feel bad for him when he's a mass murderer who committed war crimes.
Why isn't there a difficulty setting in Pokemon? Or multiple saves? Or better mechanics? Are we just not giving the devs enough money? Is capitalism failing Japan!? What is happening!!??
    Apparently, there was a hard mode (and an easy mode in the opposite version) in BW2, but for some unfathomably stupid reason, they're only accessible after beating the game (which doesn't make much sense for the hard mode, but makes absolutely zero sense for the easy mode).
        Idk what is going on over there but they need to step up their game. Is it that we keep giving them money regardless of the quality? Maybe they're gotten complacent?
a short biased synopsis*
someone please do the same for the manga
Excuse me your rival in Gold and Silver is just an insecure kid rebelling against his father and prove that he is strong
Yellow: You run around bullying kids and use your feral mouse to beat up a trans boy with a snake.
Sword/Shield: You need to beat you friend's brother while slowly break his spirit and stop the president from blowing up everything
7.8/10 Too many evil teams.
All vegans naturally graduate to pirate status after a while.
    The perfect comment
Use commas, please? Other than that pretty good stuff.
FRLG and BW made me lol. Great post!
Black/White is spot on!
I know those are legitimate games. What about Pokemon Uranium? Great game for a fan creation.
    I could try...

Uranium: Your Mom dies in a nuclear power plant because reasons, but also doesn't, goes batshit insane, and tries to nuke everybody with Optimus Prime: Nuke Edition

Insurgence: There's 5 different cults all simping for legendaries, Deoxys turns into Coronavirus 2: Electric Boogaloo, and the fabric of reality itself is saved by a kid with a pink floating magic cat

(This is made a joke; I love these games far too much to ever hate them)
I dont care what game freak says. Let's go is not apart of the main series. It deviates too much from core loops.
Sheild dats a great game
X/Y: And this is the power...  TO GO FURTHER BEYOND!
Jokes aside, Black and White have one of the best stories (in my OPINION)
i am drunk and this is Truth
B/W: You forgot the part where the king's dad was actually using the "king" as a figurehead so he could rule the world.
X/Y one is perfect
Better

B2W2: You beat up ISIS using your pets
Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald: 

• local child with questionable travel choices fights local eco-terrorists (RS) 

• local child gets caught in the middle of gang war between eco-terrorists (E) 

• Rayquaza screams "DON'T MAKE ME COME DOWN THERE!" 


Black/White: 

• local children get caught up in cult activity 

B2/W2: 

• the cultists now look like special ops
So uh you forgot about the fact that everyone you see in gen 2 and its remakes spams frickin full restores
What about Colosseum and XD?
Upvoted just for recognizing the pain Primals brought to VGC
This was BEAUTIFUL.
Also... I will never say Giratina again, instead I will always say: 
Demonic Reality Destroying Deathly Dimension Beast (or Mr. DRDDDB)
Isle of armour=You are mistaken for a new student and have to fight a sociopathic trainer in order to earn a tiny bear who only evolves when completing a tower did we mention bulbasaur and squirtle return?
D/P/P: An shuckle with a lagging Tail can move faster in the water than you ever could using surf.
Gen 1: Maybe the real champion was the rival we made along the way
BW2- They get the colours on the game title right this time.
“Vegans with a castle”
No, sword and shield is, your either a British lad or a Scottish b*tch who swears a lot, you take down your friends team of mediocre pokemon and he's not to upset, but once some metal head with a badger does it he has a existential crisis.  You then destroy the president to stop him from turning a skeleton dragons essence into energy because he interrupted your pokemon battle with your friends brother.
    r/yourjokebutworse
    The female equivalent of lad is lass, FYI.
    It wasn't Piers that made Hop depressed, was it? I remember it being him losing to Bede that caused the change.
        "Metal head with a badger"

Sounds like Piers and Obstagoon to me
            Yeah which I'm pretty sure isn't what happened. I thought it was Bede that caused Hop to get all sad. Maybe I'm remembering wrong though.
Sun and moon are literally the worst games in the entire franchise.
    The thing I love about pokemon, is everybody has vastly different opinions of each gen ect, some love it some hate it, and everyone is entitled to there opinion of course. Me personally as someone who grew up playing the games staring with pokemon yellow, sun and moon was the first time I  chose not to finish, simply because I wasn't having any fun, the story, the removal of gyms, the island challenges, having to ride around on random pokemon that your just able to summon out of ur ass, and the feeling of the game holding ur hand trying to walk you through like your a five year old who's new to games, killed it for me. But hey like I said, just my opinion, not trying to shit on anyone who likes the game
    I disagree, for me X/Y was the worst of the bunch. S/M had, in my opinion, the best characters, especially Lillie, and the music is a bop as well. 

X/Y had the premise to be good, but flopped.
    Thank god for USUM
    I still played through them twice. I really struggled to finish Shield once and haven't touched it since.
    SwSh are worse. They copy pasted the good parts from SM and fucked them up completely. Not to mention the rest being wasted potential at best.
        I don't disagree the SwSh have alot of problems/wasted potential, but I at least had fun playing the game despite my issues with it. The last several years the pokemon company had become very disconnected from its fanbase.
Where's the lie?
I felt that ORAS one
I love the BW one
OP, you should change the flair to humor
Maybe gen v is my favorite after all.
Gamma rays?
Lol Black and White was fuckin hilarious
Sword and Shield is you literally fighting the president who is trying to stop climate change with the dark age.
No, no, he's got a point.
x y is so right
Love the games with vegans and and the games with the gods of time and space and also a demon centipede the most.
You seriously, seriously sold SuMo short.
This is so accurate. Thank you
What were you trying to say instead of “are oust”?
    And oust, sorry I’ll edit that
        Oh alright. Forgot that oust was a word lol.
[deleted]
    Excuse me, ahem:

Yellow: The exact same as Red and Blue but a Pikachu inslaves you
I don’t get gen 7 description
    Totems replaced gyms and are just an infestation of wild Pokemon ganging up on you.
        But totems were neat and I liked the multiple battles
Wait what's this about gamma rays and radiation in Gold/Silver?
    One part of the story has team rocket using *radio waves* to evolve the magikarp in the lake of rage (which creates the red gyarados)
        Wow, I totally forgot about that. Wtf Team Rocket?
Ghetsis was just pretending to be vegan tho. a d then in the sequel it's fake vegan pirates vs real vegan knights
B/W, B2/W2, and X/Y got a good chuckle out of me.  Take my upvote.
It looks like you focused solely on main line titles which makes sense, but I was hoping to see some off shoots :P
Damn sword/shield sound good awful
    It’s a fun game the less you consider your actions
I lost it at Black/White one, holy christ. All of them are valid.
Sword shoel lol
From now on when i find a shiny i will yell: Heck yeah! a pokemon with radiation poisoning!
USUM : A creature obsessed with light that wrecks your team and, if the case, your nuzlock
6yo me feels called out. (For the b2w2)
USUM: I really wish someone had warned me about the Rotom-Dex. I would have given it a hard pass.
SwSh is too accurate
Wait so is the radiation that caused the Jhoto Pokémon to be shiny the same reason why all Pokémon can be shiny? Is it just a disease?
    I think the in game reason was "it evolved too fast so it never changed color" except that's bullshit because then it would have been orange.
Those damn vegans I tell you
Black and white is so hilariously accurate
Are you a bad enough dude/tte to beat up the president? Champion Leon is counting on you!
Everybody gangsta till the vegans go pirating

And get amazing battle music
I know this post was made as a joke, but I felt the need to state that the evil teams wake up the Land/Sea legendaries in RSE because the respective one helps them achieve their goal, but they underestimated the power they both wield so greatly that it might as well be that hawk meme about how they calculated a risk but suck at math.

Also, I feel bad for laughing at the SwSh one even if it's true af with Hop's depression.

Edit: Wait, different opinion? We beat up his dad cause he's a lying son of a bitch who manipulated his son and henchmen to get him all the Pokemon in the world for himself.
Seems pretty legit
In my life, I have only played Yellow, Silver, Crystal, Emerald, Heart Gold, Omega Ruby, and Sword. But you have interested me in Black/White solely based on that story beat. How badly should I play it?

I do have Y and Ultra Sun, but haven't played (backlog).
Gen 1: What is a fire dragon? I only know my awesome turtle tank!!
Not exactly with a fire dragon but with a giant dinosaur frog with a giant flower on its back
Ah i see pokemon black and white is sharing the spirit of reddit.
Sw/sh - you go on a trip with your friend to stop a rich guy making more renewable power
The wording really reminds me of the Kilian Experience
Vegans lol, I always thought that team plasma was the type of people that peta wanted to be seen as, a weird organisation but it's not that weird cause their main boy has a tragic backstory and everyone loves em.
Sun/Moon : The evil team leader thought Half-Life was a good idea
I've tried playing sun and also sword but they're just not for me sadly. I really enjoy everything from ORAS and before tho.
Oh
This is hilarious
Here's a better one for all games u catch pokemon and you battle them
    Wow I never thought of Pokémon like that before actually
Pls if I’m not the only one lmk? But I’m 23. Haven’t played any Pokémon games after emerald/saph/ruby. Just played leaf green again cause why not. But I would absolutely LOVE an open world type Pokémon game with an actual STORY/lengthy game. Like god of war. It was more open world this time around and the story was pretty long imo. Idk I’d love a Pokémon game like that :/
There’s a war and a sad guy so go catch this deer 😂😂😂😂
Ya abomination and I love em not to mention mimikyu best ghost type and best pokemon of all time
    That's why I think gen 7 is one of the best generation of Pokemon
I didn't choose Charmander in Gen 1 tho
Sword/Shield synopsis murdered me 😂
For Sun and Moon they’re not infestations, the trial leaders (or whatever they’re called) specifically train them for you to fight.
    i think youre taking this post a little seriously lol.
In my opinion Red and blue weren't that great if im being completely honest I always forget where u have to go and I can't play the game without using YouTube at least 3 times
Wait, I don't remember that part of ORAS too well. Did they actually have the right orbs this time? I remember thinking it was so funny that they got it wrong in the originals.
    Yeah, the right orbs are what let them use Primal Reversion. The wrong ones just piss them off
        Correction 

The wrong ones pisses them off.

The correct ones pisses them off AND let's them use Primal Reversion
            Is that why they couldn’t do primal reversion in the originals? Because they got the orbs wrong?
                Yep. Can't power up with the wrong item, of course.
                    Haha that means the error was on purpose!
                        Or they just fucked it up and came up with a cool/broken reason to fix it in the remakes
                            Which is a pretty cool retcon as far as retcons go
                                Is it a retcon? Nothing about ORAS disproves anything in R/S, it doesnt day “that was wrong” it just says “this also is a thing” so it’s not really a retcon, more an expansion to plot
                            Maybe Maxie and Archie can't tell the difference between red and blue
                                Fun fact: Everyone in the Pokemon universe is colorblind.
                            I thought the opposite orbs was intentional.
                I think its because of what Zenna explains in the Post Game of OR/AS>!where the are basically two different "realities" - one without all the crazy transformation and travel stuff where the OG games primarily take place in which the Ultimate Weapon didn't get fired and very little came from outside the planet other than Deoxys, then the Universe where the Ultimate Weapon did get fired and all that stuff from space landed on the planet creating all the transforming craziness, altered forms etc. of Pokemon in which the new games take place.!<
                    I’d love to see them expand on this idea
                        They sort of did in USUM to fix up any more plot holes going with like, >!infinite realities/timelines exist, and Team Rainbow Rocket you defend the USUM timeline from, but then Giovanni backs off and decides to try and conquer other realities!<
                            I kinda totally forgot about this actually, despite having played through it. USUM feels like so long ago with how much controversy SWSH have strummed up
                        I’m playing through Glazed right now and, while not canon at all, it explores this idea a bit. You switch between the Pokémon universe and our actual universe, where Pokémon is just a video game.
                            In several Pokemon games, Pokemon is a game. In FireRed and LeafGreen, they literally advertise the very games you are playing in the department store.
                                Sure, but I mean you travel between the two realities in this one and in one, there are cars and dogs and shit, like real life.
                            I’m pretty sure that’s just Digimon.
                                Don’t do this to me haha
                            Really that is cool
                            That sounds sick, I’ve only played a couple Pokémon ROM Hacks, I need to take a deep dive into it some time soon
                                I need to play more. I’ve done this one and one that is from the perspective of team rocket. Both are pretty solid. A good rom hack gives you that nostalgia as well as something a little fresh.
                    I’m glad I’m not the only one who remembers this.
            ^('the ones' is plural, so it's 'the correct ones piss them off', like in the comment you responded to.)
                God damn it. I wrote it like that originally but thought it looked wrong so I changed it lol
        I actually thought that was very clever but I have no idea if it was intentional or not
            did you make your account on opposite day
    Canonically both games take place in separate timelines. In 1 timeline mega stones exist and in the other they don’t
        Yeah I knew that. I just didn't remember them getting the orbs right in the other "timeline". I definitely need to play the games again.
        > In 1 timeline mega stones exist and in the other they don’t

More accurately would be that in 1 timeline mega stones are a common item and in the other are an exclusivity for Kalos
Technically Lance was the champion in gen 1, but your rival beat him to become the champion right before you got there.
    So wouldn't that mean while Lance was champion the Elite 4 was Loreli, Bruno, Agatha, and a fourth person we've never met? I wonder who that person was?
        My name is John, and I'm the old elite 4 normal type leader.

I got kicked out
            At least you can take the Viridian gym now that Giovanni is gone- no wait that kid took it
                And that’s why he moved to Hoenn!
                    Nah, that was because of the divorce.
                Maybe Giovanni was the old elite four member. Not responsible for maintaining the gym anymore, he committed more time to team rocket until your rival beats him, then becomes champion, which makes Lance the 4th member and sends Giovanni back to his gym. Perhaps the gym is locked before because they were still trying to find a new leader since Giovanni became part of the elite four?
                    Not possible - how could Blue have got the 8th badge when there was no leader in Veridian?
                        But we don’t know how long ago Blue got his eighth badge. Do we?
                            Can’t have been that much before Red. Blue and Red are hot on each other’s heels throughout the game. Giovanni wasn’t even back in Veridian that long before Red returned there and there was no gym leader there until Giovanni got back. Hence Blue could not have progressed to fight the Elite 4 until Giovanni was back.
            Hey, John. Screw you and your broken ass gen1 Tauros
            Just couldn’t give up the sauce, could ya, John?
                I almost beat him! But my Tauros missed the final hit :(
        I feel like if there was a fourth member then we’d see him running out crying as we walk into the Pokémon league cause your rival beats lance literally right before you get there. Like lance is spamming his Pokémon with full restores when you walk in
            In Pokemon canon though aren’t pokemon supposed to have feelings and fatigue and stuff. 

So isn’t the rival beating Lance literally the second before we get there just him loosening the pickle jar for us?

Also wouldn’t Lance and the other elite 4 have also worked down the rival before we get there.
                You underestimate the Elite four’s power to spam full restores
        There was no champion, only elite 4 members. Because both Red and Blue beat them, they battled each other for the Champion title.
            yeah i agree, there is no real "champion", just a person who defeated the elite four. then the next person to defeat the elite four has to battle the current champion for the title. its not like a job or anything.
                In a few of the games, being Champion is absolutely a job. Especially in the Unova Region, where it seems like the League has Political and Law Enforcement responsibilities, beyond simply running their gyms and testing trainers.
                    Yeah, this came to mind after I just finished Ultra Sun last night. So you are the first champion of Alola and Hau already wants to challenge you again. There could be other challengers as well and you cannot really know when they will come. What if you took off to another region other than Alola? The planet can't be 4 islands can it?
        Maybe Karen or Will?
            I think will would make the best sense since psychic was around for Red and Blue while Dark was added later
                Imagine a gen 1 psychic E4... Nightmares.
        Yeah. The old fourth member got kicked out for racist tweets he made in 09
            and for that jinx-face in 04
            Blame it on the ambien.
        I'm pretty sure it was mentioned that Lance was the fourth member and he was the champion, but because Blue beat him, there were now five members, the Elite 4 and the Champion.
            It started as just laurelei deciding she was the champion, then Bruno beat her and became the champion and she was the elite trainer.. Then Agatha beat them both and became the champion, and they were the elite Duo.. And so on
                Ah, the reverse Bink's Sake
        Giovanni, maybe? Not only is he the next strongest gym trainer, but it would also explain why he was away at first.
            Wasn't he away because he was running the pokemafia? Seems unlikely that he was a gym leader, elite 4 and mob boss.
                That'd be an impressive resumé though
                Hell, he could become potus.
                    ...now I want a Pokémon game set in the United States

... during the Civil War
                        Native Americans riding ponytas and tauros. Fuck yeah.
            Damn, I just left a whole theory about this in this thread too.
        Oh my god it’s been twenty years and I never noticed this. It’s literally the only gen where it happens. That’s so weird and it’s going to bug me forever now.
            I always imagined the Elite 4 were the same as they are in the game, and the Champion before Blue was someone else, possibly his own grandfather.
                Professor Oak wasn't the Champion before Blue. Remember, "I came when I *heard* you'd beaten the Elite Four."

Whoever Blue beat to become Champion wasn't his grandfather, because Blue is Champion before Oak hears about it.
                    Right, never mind.
            Nah, happens in the Alola games too, except you’re the first champion and have to defend your title immediately.
        No lance was a part of the elite four, there just hadn’t been anyone who managed to clear the gauntlet before blue yet. In GSC Lance does become champion, but not necessarily because red leaves. He took on the new elite four to become champion himself. I guess Lorelei left and he saw his chance 😂
    I’m pretty sure the title was vacant which was why he was the 4th member of the elite 4
    The way they made it sound was that Blue was the first person to beat the Elite 4 and became the first ever Champion. Meaning there was no champion before.
        Or maybe there was but the last one chose not to defend his/her title for some reason.
    No, there was no champion. He was just the last member of the elite 4.
        That makes most sense.
    And then you meet Red, who could’ve dick slapped Lance and your rival at the same time
        You are Red in Gen 1.
    Source?
    Nope. Even at the start of the game, if you check Oak's computer in his lab, it shows the E4 was newly formed and is hosting the gym challenge to decide a champion
        If that’s true, the mystery is solved.
    Lance was never Kanto's champion
WHAT ABOUT YELLOW BRUH
    Wasn't it the same in yellow? Blue was champion?
Or bacon
    Ah yes, shiny yveltal
        Correction, it's YAVELTAL GOD OF DARKNESS AND DEATH
            Ah yes, pokemon talk. What the fuck happened to the floor?
                It got killed by the floor tenticals
                    There's some conspiracy theory going on that says the floor tentacles were made by some foreign Dragonite
                    FUCK THATS HOT SH*T SH*T SH*T
            Ah, I see you are a man of culture as well
                Yes I am
            I JUST WANTED TO IMPRESS PEOPLE
                Bröther
            I mean, bacon should be dead too.
            I absolutely hate this sentence cuz of the recent controversies so.....

**yvetal ha ha**
                Please elaborate
                    I also require elaboration.
                        I believe he means 'Yveltal' to potentially trigger the ManjTV fans who say 'Yahvaltal', but I am not entirely 100% sure myself.
                            Not trigger the fans, I just don’t really like Michael anymore after the recent controversies. Hold on let me get the explanation:

Jubilee lied about other YouTubers defending a pedophile over a year ago. Everyone involved in the situation told Jubilee she was lying and she doubled down at first. Michael retweeted/liked her statements. In his apology, for the both of them, admitted to doing wrong but didn’t admit that from the beginning they were lying for no reason. Now people are trying to claim Jubilee is controlling Michael and forcing him to say and do these things. However Michael has a long history of agreeing with the comments Jubilee makes for years at this point. So in the end, there is no one did more than the other. They both are in the wrong and still have not fully acknowledged that.
                                Thanks for the elaboration friend
                            *my name*

*is yahvaltal*

But jokes aside I guess that makes sense.
            I see you are a man of culture as well
    Bacon bat
    Toothpaste deer and bacon bird are my favorite nicknames for legendaries ever.
        I read it as toothpaste deer and was like Xerneas looks like a toothpaste?

Then I remembered Zygarde lmao
Sometimes I wonder which he came first...

Then I remember that the enemys tried to use a deer of LIFE to kill everything...
    I took it as the machine doing the killing using Xerneas as a power source. It's like, in my mind stealing energy from Xerneas for a power source is like making a philosopher's stone in FMA. It's "life energy" but goddamn is it a horrible evil thing to do and you're gonna cause a lot of destruction when you wield that energy. Plus, you know, the whole immortality thing. I dunno, the comparison makes it work for me.
        This was my interpretation as well.
    It’s my personal headcanon that if team Flare had successfully fired the ultimate weapon using Xerneas’ power then it would have had the opposite effect they intended, granting eternal life to the whole world. By stopping team Flare, you denied the world immortality and a chance at a perfect utopia and have become the ultimate villain without even realizing it.
        Ehh, eternal life can be a curse as well. There's a SCP where everything on earth is cursed to never die. Its gets real fucking shitty, cause eternal life doesn't mean eternal healing
            Of course it's a curse, look at AZ and how much he suffered wandering the world for 3000 years, and its not like he is some cryptid, people know of him they just choose to ignore him.
            Can you link the SCP? I want to read it!
                https://youtu.be/9dLYnrXrjss

This is how I found about it, pretty sure he has a link to it if you just want to read
        Eternal Life = Overpopulation
            Only if it passes down genetically. You just have to watch your children die while you live forever.
        Trust me. Eternal life would be more of a distopia for the majority of people.
    To be fair in Y they use a soul-devouring evil bacon bird of death instead.
I never played X: does Xerneas come from some ominous demon egg the same way Yveltal does?
    No, Xerneas cutscene is it transforming..... from a tree. Cuz that’s what it does, for some reason.

*weird fairy tree*
        Tree of Life. It is somewhat surprising how easy it can be to miss.
            It not being a grass type helps
                It's basically the same as the deer God thing from Princess Mononoke.
                It really should be. Grass is weak to Flying, Dark is weak to Fairy, it would make them more even
                    It would also help make it not stupidly broken in VGC as well. Giving it a 4x weakness + fire and flying would make Geomancy not seem as op.
        What is it with this game and things that look like trees but aren't trees
            Pseudo

Wood

Oh
                Bonsai + Lie
                    Or bon-Sly
                        Bons-lie
                    Holy fuck
                    No. Way.
                Also the ninja kids in Ruby/Sapphire who hide behind cardboard cutouts of trees
                    i loved that so much back then. still love it today
I like how some Pokémon are fun and playful, some are quirky creatures, then you have stuff like giratina (basically satan) and darkrai (nightmare demon). 

oh and the creepy ones like hypno and drifloon..
    [deleted]
        the legendaries have crazy entries in general, most of them sound terrifying.
    I wouldn't call Giratina satan. Its more likely he was banished for his world warping powers, to the distortion would so he be of no harm to the world Arceus created. Maybe its just a personal head cannon but hey.
        giratina isn’t satan, it’s just the Pokémon equivalent.

it was banished for being too violent, and it’s the “renegade” Pokémon. Satan was banished for pride not violence but both were banished for abuse of power (just in different ways).

Giratina is more of the “rouge rebel” Pokémon than the “satan” Pokémon but satan is pretty much the embodiment of rebellion and defiance.

You’re right, they’re not the same. but they share a ton of similarities.
            no, giratina is neither satan, nor it's pokémon equivalent

it also wasn't violent, it caused harm to spacetime by it's mere existence, so it was was stored away safely into another reality where it couldn't cause any harm to the real world.

also, satan was not banished for pride but for opposing the evil sky dictatos decree. not out of pride, but out of a sense of justice. or maybe i'm confusing him with melek taus. i do get their stories mixed up at times.
                yes it was violent, it’s literal Pokédex entry is:
“It was banished for its violence. It silently gazed upon the old world from the Distortion World.”

God banished Satan because “wickedness found him” and he later says “Your heart became proud on account of your beauty, and you corrupted your wisdom because of your splendor. So I threw you to earth; I made a spectacle of you before kings.” 

satan was banished for pride and corruption. 

* both rebels
* both banished 
* both are made from god and punished for their nature

there is no “satan” Pokémon but giratina is the closest example. If it’s not the equivalent, then what is? 

It’s the “renegade” Pokémon and satan was the first renegade in Christian beliefs.
if it’s any consolation, competitive players see the deer as the living embodiment of death
    **geomancy intensifies**
        That's a nice deer you got there. Sure would be a shame if some paintbrush sloth gave it Grass typing.
            Not that saying it looks like a sloth is untrue, but if you mean Smeargle it's based on a beagle dog, hence the name
                I legitimately didn't know that. Thank you for enlightening me to the existence of Paintbrush Snoopy.
                    No problem! I think the fact that there's always more to learn about the Pokemon world is what made it so interesting to me as a kid
*laughs in Shedinja*
YAHVELTALL, GOD OF DEATH!
    Ah a fellow individual of culture I see
        A fellow MandJTV fan I see
I read up to x/y and figured the top comment would be addressing that and Im glad it did.
New fone who dis?
The fact that they didn’t explore DEATH ITSELF being a Pokemon in X/Y is another reason why those games are just... just the worst.
That's a straight up mood
    You know you have issues when you agree with Cyrus … and Lysandre … I need help.
        What did Lysandre do? Hate bad fashion?
            Want to murder 90% of the human population and 100% of Pokémon.
                If I somehow existed in a pokemon world and someone wanted to kill all of the pokemon they would have to start with me. Pokemon being real is my wildest fantasy and if I got it I would defend it.
            Lysandre read a lot of Ayn Rand in college and just ran with it
                Holy fuck this is funny 

But looking at the state of the world today, he’s not wrong
            I think he was Pokemon’s Thanos.
                But with crappier motivations
        Just shoot the planet with a giant space laser. It's not like it can get any worse.
            he was mad xy was left unfinished
    This timeline fucking sucks
Yeah
I'm pretty sure he also summons Giratina by accident in Platinum, he intends to summon both Dialga *and* Palkia instead of just one, but doing so poses enough of a threat to the world that Giratina interferes.
And he is only 27.
And then he just fucks off to Giratina's world
Lysander wanted to do the same but for some reason people hate him more...
Smh
Same
Cyrus wanted to pull a Thanos
I mean I *sort of* get their logic. Maybe they were thinking that the opposite Orb, being the one representing the other legendary, would be the one that would cause their desired legendary to back down and obey. Maybe they figured the corresponding orb would make them more powerful and cause them to get out of control.

Still dumb of them, but I kinda get it.
    I think it has something to do with the lines in their bodies. Kyogre has red lines, Groundon in most art has black but I think originally it was a dark blue. The orb probably charged the lines or something like that.
        True, but even then, the patterns on the orbs were the same patterns on the corresponding legendary. You think they'd make that connection at least.
            The pattern only existed in ORAS. [In RSE/the anime](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Red_Orb#Appearance), it was literally just a red orb with nothing on it. However, reading the bulbapedia post, Team M/A actually did grab the wrong orb. I guess I was wrong all this time. I played Sapphire so long ago, I could've sworn the old couple said both orbs were needed and Archie only grabbed one.
    They were right on that logic, but were several years early.
    Well, the matching orbs did end up doing that.
    Even more confusing is Team Aqua trying to raise the sea level, even though their base isn't even flood proof, nor do they have more than one submarine.
Also how do you breath underwater?
    I always think this. 

Since I want to capture Kyogre, I need something to weaken it, not the orb to make it stronger. So, the orb of its rival.

Little did they know what they ultimately want is the trio master.
"Groudon was in the cave because SOMEONE used the wrong orb and pissed him off."

\-Jaiden
Blue fire is more hot than red fire so maybe that confused them
    They just big Azula fans
Literal Bruh moment
They must’ve watched the anime before going through with their plans
I figured it was to make Groudon awaken because he smelt Kyogre's ball in his house.

If he just smelt his own ball he'd stay asleep.
* ULTRA NECROZMA THEME PLAYS AGGRESSIVELY *
    Vietnam flashbacks intensify
        I actually want to praise the director USUM. It's like he heard that the fans were complaining about the games being too easy and had a field day with it.
            And then they removed him and had Ohmori back for Sword and Shield so it became too easy again.
    Best theme ever
        I agree
I only beat ultra Necrozma because my Pokémon's affection to me was so high that two of them lived on 1hp, so I was able to defeat it on the first try.
    See, I had Pokémon from another game and another language so already they're getting x1.7 experience. Combine that with the experience boost from affection and Rotom-Lotto I was so overlevelled for Ultra Necrozma I took it down in two or three hits.
    i did something similar. i used a honchkrow with full affection and a focus sash(which you can get from one of the trainers at Poni Poni Island) and let it take a hit which dropped it to 1hp and used haze to eliminated the boosted stats, which then i took it out with two hits.
        Similar Plan. Had a Focus Sash Incineroar use Devastating Drake after surviving Power Gem, then had a Noivern live one HP to give Dragon Pulse,and Swampert dodge Prismatic Laser to give Earthquake. the last 2 were Affectionate, and I relished that Saturday Morning.
    I just found that my decidueye’s Z-move was over-powered against it, so I also beat it first try.
I laughed much harder than I expected at this
Can confirm on that last statement. One of the rare times I lost to something in the story.
Not a widow; divorcee
I only won because I just happened to have the perfect make shift counter ready. I opened with my vikavolt and taught it a paralysis TM before the match started while holding a focus sash. So it survived with 1hp left before firing off a thunder wave giving my team barely enough opportunities to do some damage and finally win.
She's not a widow. Her ex moved away to own his own archipelago.
So... SMUSUM is basically the Area 51 raid?
Do we have skulls on our caps?
    Happy cake Day!
        Thanks man! Damn another year I didn’t even realize!
    Am I the man behind the slaughter?
    Happy skull cap day!
    Happy cake day!
You figured that out now?
    I mean, we are the “bad ones” when it comes to individual people in the story but I never thought of us being the bad ones in the whole story. Would make for a great post game: consolidate your power and recruit your followers.
        We don’t really have any motivation other than being powerful though

We just happen to stop whatever scheme is afoot and don’t really have any ideology
            We choose to though and the main story can allow you to make those choices. Or it can be the same as a school bully - just for the power.

We're more like anti-heroes. We're not great but we're better than the terrorists, cults and corporations.
Oh my God! That's how we solve this whole police problem! Just give children dangerous monsters and everything will be okay!
    Didn't Americans recently discover that the answer to school shootings is to have guns in schools? Seems like the right direction
        The one upside to 2020, school shootings are way down

                You ok?
                    No, I miss being shot at so much that I'm shooting myself
I mean recent games *literally* have Interpol hiring you because they're incapable of doing the job on their own.
Wait, Rose is Hop's dad?
    He is Bede’s adoptive dad or something 

Basically the edgy rivals tend to have shit parents.
        Wait, Rose is Bede's adoptive son?
            Pretty sure it's the other way around (Oleana ad Bede are both "adopted" by Rose, but not like really adopted, he just gave them both a place to be and a purpose).
            Well, Rose just really endorsed Bede for the gym challenge because he saw good potential. They’re not related or anything.
    No no the slightly better rival
On god Officer Jenny been caught lackin for over 20 years now
    The only thing she can catch is a Brock
        And a Squirtle. But then she just gives it to you
If you think about it, Leon in S&S is you in every other game. Maybe there’s no evil team in Galar because he took care of them already, and he was the one who (tried to) take care of Eternatus
    See, this take is why I really like the idea of what they were going for in S&S. And the fact that they didn't trust a young teenager to solve the world's problems. Simply mind-blowing idea, that young teenagers may be unfit for entrusting the future of the world with.
        I get that, I really do. But the sudden break away from this weird unrealistic thing they've been doing since the very first game was itself bizarre. At least add something else in its place if you're going to strip it out!
PETA but they backstab everyone
    So PETA
        I've heard a conspiracy that PETA is actually funded by meat productors to make vegans/animal rights activists look ridiculous

Not gonna lie I wouldn't be surprised lol
            I love your flair
            I don't know about that, but the meat industry actually does a lot of work to spread shit about them. PETA does do some sketchy campaigns from time to time like blatant sexualisation of women, but also have a lot of accomplishments to their name on areas like animal testing.
Ghetsis is very much a cult leader
So it's supporting the second amendment?
    The right to bear mons
        *I deserve the right to own as many Ursarings, Beartics, and Bewears in my house*
    Pretty much. To swap out Pokemons for guns in the plot, Team Plasma was protesting that no one should have guns at all, which Ghetsis pushed so that only he and those he trusted would have guns to make the general populace easier to control. Any benevolence regarding the removal of guns from the general populace was merely a front.
        Wait... is this what Americans think of gun control?
        Sounds like the radical left in America.  (Before you start down voting, I said the *radical* left, not the normal left, of which I hope most of you are.)
You fight King Bumi from ATLA
    this... is a perfect comparison
He's an alternative universe Master Roshi.
I looked at Klara as more of the person that will murder you in your sleep if piss her off
    The way she applies pressure to her Poke Ball makes me anxious...
I mean, say what you want, I loved the rivals. They were honestly funny to see, they were basic, but charming, kinda like gen 5 rivals
    I second that opinion.
At least 1 has a good song
Goddam pirate vegans
    At least they don’t have to worry about getting scurvy
        Scraggy on the other hand
I don't think Ghetsis was just "having a different opinion" though
    He was also a horribly abusive and manipulative father, so we weren't kidnapping his son as much as we were acting of behalf of CPS, which unsurprisingly, don't seem to exist in the world of Pokemon.
    Nah, he was a straight up terrorist especially in BW2.
        He went from cult leader to terrorist
Not even. The region will run out of energy in 1000 years if he doesn't interrupt your championship battle with a minor inconvenience.
    The champion wanted the chairman to wait, but the chairman has a God complex. He's also an anti-villain with far more sympathetic goals than most villains in Pokemon.
        He just got too excited and did it early. Not a bad bone there in his body
            Rose isn’t really a bad guy, he’s an antagonist. People often cite that as a flaw, but personally I think it’s a good mix up from gen 6’s villain, which is the absolute worst. Pokémon villains have never been good, but some were actually threatening a little bit, however I do think not including a villain, and instead having a man whose trying to do good, even if he has some (unconfirmed) mental complex, is a decent twist, it’s not good, but at least it’s different
                Yeah, I agree. He also encourages you to fix it, and wasn’t being malicious
I assumed the chairman was going to be evil when I first saw him. No good person has that hairdo.

Also, I honestly thought Bede was an elderly lady until I met an actual elderly lady.
    No kidding, I'm still not completely certain if Bede is a boy or a girl
    >No good person has that hairdo.

Or those shorts. 😫
        The shorts honestly made me think...no villain would wear those shorts, maybe he's not the villain!
            Oleana was acting a little shifty and I assumed she was gonna backstab but nope, she's loyal to a fault to a crazy jolly man.
    Honestly he's an elderly lady at heart
    My character has that hair 🙃
So he releases a giant space chicken to create renewable energy but it’s too powerful so you throw one pokeball at it and catch it instantly. 

Then later on two douche bags with stupid ass haircuts show up out of nowhere claiming to be sovereign rulers of Great Britain and because of this they’re allowed to pump steroids into random Pokémon and let them loose in all the gyms. Then you whoop their asses for the third time and they say “We’re soooooo sowwy pwease forgive us” and you just let them walk away. The End.
Am I the only one that suspected the chairman from the instant he was introduced?

Like, you're too old to be a rival, you're not the champion, and you're introduced before the first gym badge as a major character? You're the big bad.
Favorite one is either BW2 or XY
    My favorite is XY by far
You forgot about getting attacked by a crazy disco addict with dance moves
    With arguably the best soundtrack in the whole game.
        With undeniably the **BEST** soundtrack in *every* game
A chick you found in a potato sack who swears you a life debt. She’s literally Chewbacca.
We need a new Colosseum installment on Switch. The hardware would take that kind of game to so many amazing places. . .

Oh and also obligatory "the models in Colosseum/XD are still superior to the modern-day models used even in SW/SH."

That “Gen 5 and a half“ part had me dying
And uses stolen technology to merge his dragon with his son's dragon who's a good guy now (and literally saves you from getting impaled by icicles).

Why would I ever pick a fire dragon when I could have a literal turtle TANK!
No.

It was because mega rayquaza
    Oh yeah... fuck that thing, I’ve fought it in USUM, and it’s the stuff of nightmares
    Both
Charizard. A literal dragon. Nah fam he flying type.
Agreed! I’m totally biased cause I’m sentimental and it’s my fav game but to me they did a great job expanding the storyline, plus it’s the first game where you really get to interact with your Pokémon! Turning around and chatting to them always made me so happy :)
And they're Gen 6

Coincidence?
    Big hero gen 6
Not really, alt-coloration is just a rare biological phenomenon, like irl albinism. However, the most famous shiny in the fandom, the Lake of Rage red gyarados (introduced in the plot precisely to showcase the new shiny feature), WAS a mutant that was forced to evolve with radio waves
    When you age prematurely
It's the origin of the Lake of Rage red Gyarados.

        You're missing out. Try HGSS.
            (Sad no DS noises)
                You should try an emulator. HGSS is a masterpiece
                (Happy emulator noises)
                    Does emulator work with BW and B2W2? Everyone seems to love those games
                        Depends on what emulator you are using. If you have an iPhone, for example, you could get NDS4ios. There are plenty of other options too.
                            I have OnePlus

Rip
                                I bought DraStic for my Note 10 since free emulators didn’t work with some games. It’s worth the ~$5 imo.
It’s not tho… :|

This [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/hguzcd/a_short_synopsis_on_every_game/fw6y81i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) summarizes it accurately.
    Ah, my mistake
Let's Go Pikachu and Let's Go Eevee
Figured it out: Let's go Pikachu/Let's go Eevee.
I despise gen7
    I respectfully disagree, I love Sun and Moon.
        It’s just me I guess. The handholding mixed with the meh story and meh animations makes me not like it so much. Also I hated gen 7 VGC it was awful
            Yeah I don't follow the meta that much but I personally liked the story and characters. But yeah I definitely understand why a lot of people don't like it.
                I guess the root of it all for me is the gen 7 meta
Same as GS but now theres a *probably* gay magician chasing the aurora wolf.
And secretly eats veal.
And the game has the gall to try to demand we feel bad for him when he's a mass murderer who committed war crimes.
Apparently, there was a hard mode (and an easy mode in the opposite version) in BW2, but for some unfathomably stupid reason, they're only accessible after beating the game (which doesn't make much sense for the hard mode, but makes absolutely zero sense for the easy mode).
    Idk what is going on over there but they need to step up their game. Is it that we keep giving them money regardless of the quality? Maybe they're gotten complacent?
The perfect comment
I could try...

Uranium: Your Mom dies in a nuclear power plant because reasons, but also doesn't, goes batshit insane, and tries to nuke everybody with Optimus Prime: Nuke Edition

Insurgence: There's 5 different cults all simping for legendaries, Deoxys turns into Coronavirus 2: Electric Boogaloo, and the fabric of reality itself is saved by a kid with a pink floating magic cat

(This is made a joke; I love these games far too much to ever hate them)

The female equivalent of lad is lass, FYI.
It wasn't Piers that made Hop depressed, was it? I remember it being him losing to Bede that caused the change.
    "Metal head with a badger"

Sounds like Piers and Obstagoon to me
        Yeah which I'm pretty sure isn't what happened. I thought it was Bede that caused Hop to get all sad. Maybe I'm remembering wrong though.
The thing I love about pokemon, is everybody has vastly different opinions of each gen ect, some love it some hate it, and everyone is entitled to there opinion of course. Me personally as someone who grew up playing the games staring with pokemon yellow, sun and moon was the first time I  chose not to finish, simply because I wasn't having any fun, the story, the removal of gyms, the island challenges, having to ride around on random pokemon that your just able to summon out of ur ass, and the feeling of the game holding ur hand trying to walk you through like your a five year old who's new to games, killed it for me. But hey like I said, just my opinion, not trying to shit on anyone who likes the game
I disagree, for me X/Y was the worst of the bunch. S/M had, in my opinion, the best characters, especially Lillie, and the music is a bop as well. 

X/Y had the premise to be good, but flopped.
Thank god for USUM
I still played through them twice. I really struggled to finish Shield once and haven't touched it since.
SwSh are worse. They copy pasted the good parts from SM and fucked them up completely. Not to mention the rest being wasted potential at best.
    I don't disagree the SwSh have alot of problems/wasted potential, but I at least had fun playing the game despite my issues with it. The last several years the pokemon company had become very disconnected from its fanbase.
And oust, sorry I’ll edit that
    Oh alright. Forgot that oust was a word lol.
Excuse me, ahem:

Yellow: The exact same as Red and Blue but a Pikachu inslaves you
Totems replaced gyms and are just an infestation of wild Pokemon ganging up on you.
    But totems were neat and I liked the multiple battles
One part of the story has team rocket using *radio waves* to evolve the magikarp in the lake of rage (which creates the red gyarados)
    Wow, I totally forgot about that. Wtf Team Rocket?
It’s a fun game the less you consider your actions
I think the in game reason was "it evolved too fast so it never changed color" except that's bullshit because then it would have been orange.
Wow I never thought of Pokémon like that before actually
That's why I think gen 7 is one of the best generation of Pokemon
i think youre taking this post a little seriously lol.
Yeah, the right orbs are what let them use Primal Reversion. The wrong ones just piss them off
    Correction 

The wrong ones pisses them off.

The correct ones pisses them off AND let's them use Primal Reversion
        Is that why they couldn’t do primal reversion in the originals? Because they got the orbs wrong?
            Yep. Can't power up with the wrong item, of course.
                Haha that means the error was on purpose!
                    Or they just fucked it up and came up with a cool/broken reason to fix it in the remakes
                        Which is a pretty cool retcon as far as retcons go
                            Is it a retcon? Nothing about ORAS disproves anything in R/S, it doesnt day “that was wrong” it just says “this also is a thing” so it’s not really a retcon, more an expansion to plot
                        Maybe Maxie and Archie can't tell the difference between red and blue
                            Fun fact: Everyone in the Pokemon universe is colorblind.
                        I thought the opposite orbs was intentional.
            I think its because of what Zenna explains in the Post Game of OR/AS>!where the are basically two different "realities" - one without all the crazy transformation and travel stuff where the OG games primarily take place in which the Ultimate Weapon didn't get fired and very little came from outside the planet other than Deoxys, then the Universe where the Ultimate Weapon did get fired and all that stuff from space landed on the planet creating all the transforming craziness, altered forms etc. of Pokemon in which the new games take place.!<
                I’d love to see them expand on this idea
                    They sort of did in USUM to fix up any more plot holes going with like, >!infinite realities/timelines exist, and Team Rainbow Rocket you defend the USUM timeline from, but then Giovanni backs off and decides to try and conquer other realities!<
                        I kinda totally forgot about this actually, despite having played through it. USUM feels like so long ago with how much controversy SWSH have strummed up
                    I’m playing through Glazed right now and, while not canon at all, it explores this idea a bit. You switch between the Pokémon universe and our actual universe, where Pokémon is just a video game.
                        In several Pokemon games, Pokemon is a game. In FireRed and LeafGreen, they literally advertise the very games you are playing in the department store.
                            Sure, but I mean you travel between the two realities in this one and in one, there are cars and dogs and shit, like real life.
                        I’m pretty sure that’s just Digimon.
                            Don’t do this to me haha
                        Really that is cool
                        That sounds sick, I’ve only played a couple Pokémon ROM Hacks, I need to take a deep dive into it some time soon
                            I need to play more. I’ve done this one and one that is from the perspective of team rocket. Both are pretty solid. A good rom hack gives you that nostalgia as well as something a little fresh.
                I’m glad I’m not the only one who remembers this.
        ^('the ones' is plural, so it's 'the correct ones piss them off', like in the comment you responded to.)
            God damn it. I wrote it like that originally but thought it looked wrong so I changed it lol
    I actually thought that was very clever but I have no idea if it was intentional or not
        did you make your account on opposite day
Canonically both games take place in separate timelines. In 1 timeline mega stones exist and in the other they don’t
    Yeah I knew that. I just didn't remember them getting the orbs right in the other "timeline". I definitely need to play the games again.
    > In 1 timeline mega stones exist and in the other they don’t

More accurately would be that in 1 timeline mega stones are a common item and in the other are an exclusivity for Kalos
So wouldn't that mean while Lance was champion the Elite 4 was Loreli, Bruno, Agatha, and a fourth person we've never met? I wonder who that person was?
    My name is John, and I'm the old elite 4 normal type leader.

I got kicked out
        At least you can take the Viridian gym now that Giovanni is gone- no wait that kid took it
            And that’s why he moved to Hoenn!
                Nah, that was because of the divorce.
            Maybe Giovanni was the old elite four member. Not responsible for maintaining the gym anymore, he committed more time to team rocket until your rival beats him, then becomes champion, which makes Lance the 4th member and sends Giovanni back to his gym. Perhaps the gym is locked before because they were still trying to find a new leader since Giovanni became part of the elite four?
                Not possible - how could Blue have got the 8th badge when there was no leader in Veridian?
                    But we don’t know how long ago Blue got his eighth badge. Do we?
                        Can’t have been that much before Red. Blue and Red are hot on each other’s heels throughout the game. Giovanni wasn’t even back in Veridian that long before Red returned there and there was no gym leader there until Giovanni got back. Hence Blue could not have progressed to fight the Elite 4 until Giovanni was back.
        Hey, John. Screw you and your broken ass gen1 Tauros
        Just couldn’t give up the sauce, could ya, John?
            I almost beat him! But my Tauros missed the final hit :(
    I feel like if there was a fourth member then we’d see him running out crying as we walk into the Pokémon league cause your rival beats lance literally right before you get there. Like lance is spamming his Pokémon with full restores when you walk in
        In Pokemon canon though aren’t pokemon supposed to have feelings and fatigue and stuff. 

So isn’t the rival beating Lance literally the second before we get there just him loosening the pickle jar for us?

Also wouldn’t Lance and the other elite 4 have also worked down the rival before we get there.
            You underestimate the Elite four’s power to spam full restores
    There was no champion, only elite 4 members. Because both Red and Blue beat them, they battled each other for the Champion title.
        yeah i agree, there is no real "champion", just a person who defeated the elite four. then the next person to defeat the elite four has to battle the current champion for the title. its not like a job or anything.
            In a few of the games, being Champion is absolutely a job. Especially in the Unova Region, where it seems like the League has Political and Law Enforcement responsibilities, beyond simply running their gyms and testing trainers.
                Yeah, this came to mind after I just finished Ultra Sun last night. So you are the first champion of Alola and Hau already wants to challenge you again. There could be other challengers as well and you cannot really know when they will come. What if you took off to another region other than Alola? The planet can't be 4 islands can it?
    Maybe Karen or Will?
        I think will would make the best sense since psychic was around for Red and Blue while Dark was added later
            Imagine a gen 1 psychic E4... Nightmares.
    Yeah. The old fourth member got kicked out for racist tweets he made in 09
        and for that jinx-face in 04
        Blame it on the ambien.
    I'm pretty sure it was mentioned that Lance was the fourth member and he was the champion, but because Blue beat him, there were now five members, the Elite 4 and the Champion.
        It started as just laurelei deciding she was the champion, then Bruno beat her and became the champion and she was the elite trainer.. Then Agatha beat them both and became the champion, and they were the elite Duo.. And so on
            Ah, the reverse Bink's Sake
    Giovanni, maybe? Not only is he the next strongest gym trainer, but it would also explain why he was away at first.
        Wasn't he away because he was running the pokemafia? Seems unlikely that he was a gym leader, elite 4 and mob boss.
            That'd be an impressive resumé though
            Hell, he could become potus.
                ...now I want a Pokémon game set in the United States

... during the Civil War
                    Native Americans riding ponytas and tauros. Fuck yeah.
        Damn, I just left a whole theory about this in this thread too.
    Oh my god it’s been twenty years and I never noticed this. It’s literally the only gen where it happens. That’s so weird and it’s going to bug me forever now.
        I always imagined the Elite 4 were the same as they are in the game, and the Champion before Blue was someone else, possibly his own grandfather.
            Professor Oak wasn't the Champion before Blue. Remember, "I came when I *heard* you'd beaten the Elite Four."

Whoever Blue beat to become Champion wasn't his grandfather, because Blue is Champion before Oak hears about it.
                Right, never mind.
        Nah, happens in the Alola games too, except you’re the first champion and have to defend your title immediately.
    No lance was a part of the elite four, there just hadn’t been anyone who managed to clear the gauntlet before blue yet. In GSC Lance does become champion, but not necessarily because red leaves. He took on the new elite four to become champion himself. I guess Lorelei left and he saw his chance 😂
I’m pretty sure the title was vacant which was why he was the 4th member of the elite 4
The way they made it sound was that Blue was the first person to beat the Elite 4 and became the first ever Champion. Meaning there was no champion before.
    Or maybe there was but the last one chose not to defend his/her title for some reason.
No, there was no champion. He was just the last member of the elite 4.
    That makes most sense.
And then you meet Red, who could’ve dick slapped Lance and your rival at the same time
    You are Red in Gen 1.
Source?
Nope. Even at the start of the game, if you check Oak's computer in his lab, it shows the E4 was newly formed and is hosting the gym challenge to decide a champion
    If that’s true, the mystery is solved.
Lance was never Kanto's champion
Wasn't it the same in yellow? Blue was champion?
Ah yes, shiny yveltal
    Correction, it's YAVELTAL GOD OF DARKNESS AND DEATH
        Ah yes, pokemon talk. What the fuck happened to the floor?
            It got killed by the floor tenticals
                There's some conspiracy theory going on that says the floor tentacles were made by some foreign Dragonite
                FUCK THATS HOT SH*T SH*T SH*T
        Ah, I see you are a man of culture as well
            Yes I am
        I JUST WANTED TO IMPRESS PEOPLE
            Bröther
        I mean, bacon should be dead too.
        I absolutely hate this sentence cuz of the recent controversies so.....

**yvetal ha ha**
            Please elaborate
                I also require elaboration.
                    I believe he means 'Yveltal' to potentially trigger the ManjTV fans who say 'Yahvaltal', but I am not entirely 100% sure myself.
                        Not trigger the fans, I just don’t really like Michael anymore after the recent controversies. Hold on let me get the explanation:

Jubilee lied about other YouTubers defending a pedophile over a year ago. Everyone involved in the situation told Jubilee she was lying and she doubled down at first. Michael retweeted/liked her statements. In his apology, for the both of them, admitted to doing wrong but didn’t admit that from the beginning they were lying for no reason. Now people are trying to claim Jubilee is controlling Michael and forcing him to say and do these things. However Michael has a long history of agreeing with the comments Jubilee makes for years at this point. So in the end, there is no one did more than the other. They both are in the wrong and still have not fully acknowledged that.
                            Thanks for the elaboration friend
                        *my name*

*is yahvaltal*

But jokes aside I guess that makes sense.
        I see you are a man of culture as well
Bacon bat
Toothpaste deer and bacon bird are my favorite nicknames for legendaries ever.
    I read it as toothpaste deer and was like Xerneas looks like a toothpaste?

Then I remembered Zygarde lmao
I took it as the machine doing the killing using Xerneas as a power source. It's like, in my mind stealing energy from Xerneas for a power source is like making a philosopher's stone in FMA. It's "life energy" but goddamn is it a horrible evil thing to do and you're gonna cause a lot of destruction when you wield that energy. Plus, you know, the whole immortality thing. I dunno, the comparison makes it work for me.
    This was my interpretation as well.
It’s my personal headcanon that if team Flare had successfully fired the ultimate weapon using Xerneas’ power then it would have had the opposite effect they intended, granting eternal life to the whole world. By stopping team Flare, you denied the world immortality and a chance at a perfect utopia and have become the ultimate villain without even realizing it.
    Ehh, eternal life can be a curse as well. There's a SCP where everything on earth is cursed to never die. Its gets real fucking shitty, cause eternal life doesn't mean eternal healing
        Of course it's a curse, look at AZ and how much he suffered wandering the world for 3000 years, and its not like he is some cryptid, people know of him they just choose to ignore him.
        Can you link the SCP? I want to read it!
            https://youtu.be/9dLYnrXrjss

This is how I found about it, pretty sure he has a link to it if you just want to read
    Eternal Life = Overpopulation
        Only if it passes down genetically. You just have to watch your children die while you live forever.
    Trust me. Eternal life would be more of a distopia for the majority of people.
To be fair in Y they use a soul-devouring evil bacon bird of death instead.
No, Xerneas cutscene is it transforming..... from a tree. Cuz that’s what it does, for some reason.

*weird fairy tree*
    Tree of Life. It is somewhat surprising how easy it can be to miss.
        It not being a grass type helps
            It's basically the same as the deer God thing from Princess Mononoke.
            It really should be. Grass is weak to Flying, Dark is weak to Fairy, it would make them more even
                It would also help make it not stupidly broken in VGC as well. Giving it a 4x weakness + fire and flying would make Geomancy not seem as op.
    What is it with this game and things that look like trees but aren't trees
        Pseudo

Wood

Oh
            Bonsai + Lie

                No. Way.
            Also the ninja kids in Ruby/Sapphire who hide behind cardboard cutouts of trees
                i loved that so much back then. still love it today

    the legendaries have crazy entries in general, most of them sound terrifying.
I wouldn't call Giratina satan. Its more likely he was banished for his world warping powers, to the distortion would so he be of no harm to the world Arceus created. Maybe its just a personal head cannon but hey.
    giratina isn’t satan, it’s just the Pokémon equivalent.

it was banished for being too violent, and it’s the “renegade” Pokémon. Satan was banished for pride not violence but both were banished for abuse of power (just in different ways).

Giratina is more of the “rouge rebel” Pokémon than the “satan” Pokémon but satan is pretty much the embodiment of rebellion and defiance.

You’re right, they’re not the same. but they share a ton of similarities.
        no, giratina is neither satan, nor it's pokémon equivalent

it also wasn't violent, it caused harm to spacetime by it's mere existence, so it was was stored away safely into another reality where it couldn't cause any harm to the real world.

also, satan was not banished for pride but for opposing the evil sky dictatos decree. not out of pride, but out of a sense of justice. or maybe i'm confusing him with melek taus. i do get their stories mixed up at times.
            yes it was violent, it’s literal Pokédex entry is:
“It was banished for its violence. It silently gazed upon the old world from the Distortion World.”

God banished Satan because “wickedness found him” and he later says “Your heart became proud on account of your beauty, and you corrupted your wisdom because of your splendor. So I threw you to earth; I made a spectacle of you before kings.” 

satan was banished for pride and corruption. 

* both rebels
* both banished 
* both are made from god and punished for their nature

there is no “satan” Pokémon but giratina is the closest example. If it’s not the equivalent, then what is? 

It’s the “renegade” Pokémon and satan was the first renegade in Christian beliefs.
**geomancy intensifies**
    That's a nice deer you got there. Sure would be a shame if some paintbrush sloth gave it Grass typing.
        Not that saying it looks like a sloth is untrue, but if you mean Smeargle it's based on a beagle dog, hence the name
            I legitimately didn't know that. Thank you for enlightening me to the existence of Paintbrush Snoopy.
                No problem! I think the fact that there's always more to learn about the Pokemon world is what made it so interesting to me as a kid
Ah a fellow individual of culture I see
    A fellow MandJTV fan I see
You know you have issues when you agree with Cyrus … and Lysandre … I need help.
    What did Lysandre do? Hate bad fashion?
        Want to murder 90% of the human population and 100% of Pokémon.
            If I somehow existed in a pokemon world and someone wanted to kill all of the pokemon they would have to start with me. Pokemon being real is my wildest fantasy and if I got it I would defend it.
        Lysandre read a lot of Ayn Rand in college and just ran with it
            Holy fuck this is funny 

But looking at the state of the world today, he’s not wrong
        I think he was Pokemon’s Thanos.
            But with crappier motivations
    Just shoot the planet with a giant space laser. It's not like it can get any worse.
        he was mad xy was left unfinished
This timeline fucking sucks
I think it has something to do with the lines in their bodies. Kyogre has red lines, Groundon in most art has black but I think originally it was a dark blue. The orb probably charged the lines or something like that.
    True, but even then, the patterns on the orbs were the same patterns on the corresponding legendary. You think they'd make that connection at least.
        The pattern only existed in ORAS. [In RSE/the anime](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Red_Orb#Appearance), it was literally just a red orb with nothing on it. However, reading the bulbapedia post, Team M/A actually did grab the wrong orb. I guess I was wrong all this time. I played Sapphire so long ago, I could've sworn the old couple said both orbs were needed and Archie only grabbed one.
They were right on that logic, but were several years early.
Well, the matching orbs did end up doing that.
Even more confusing is Team Aqua trying to raise the sea level, even though their base isn't even flood proof, nor do they have more than one submarine.
Also how do you breath underwater?
I always think this. 

Since I want to capture Kyogre, I need something to weaken it, not the orb to make it stronger. So, the orb of its rival.

Little did they know what they ultimately want is the trio master.
They just big Azula fans
Vietnam flashbacks intensify
    I actually want to praise the director USUM. It's like he heard that the fans were complaining about the games being too easy and had a field day with it.
        And then they removed him and had Ohmori back for Sword and Shield so it became too easy again.
Best theme ever
    I agree
See, I had Pokémon from another game and another language so already they're getting x1.7 experience. Combine that with the experience boost from affection and Rotom-Lotto I was so overlevelled for Ultra Necrozma I took it down in two or three hits.
i did something similar. i used a honchkrow with full affection and a focus sash(which you can get from one of the trainers at Poni Poni Island) and let it take a hit which dropped it to 1hp and used haze to eliminated the boosted stats, which then i took it out with two hits.
    Similar Plan. Had a Focus Sash Incineroar use Devastating Drake after surviving Power Gem, then had a Noivern live one HP to give Dragon Pulse,and Swampert dodge Prismatic Laser to give Earthquake. the last 2 were Affectionate, and I relished that Saturday Morning.
I just found that my decidueye’s Z-move was over-powered against it, so I also beat it first try.
Happy cake Day!
    Thanks man! Damn another year I didn’t even realize!
Am I the man behind the slaughter?
Happy skull cap day!
Happy cake day!
I mean, we are the “bad ones” when it comes to individual people in the story but I never thought of us being the bad ones in the whole story. Would make for a great post game: consolidate your power and recruit your followers.
    We don’t really have any motivation other than being powerful though

We just happen to stop whatever scheme is afoot and don’t really have any ideology
        We choose to though and the main story can allow you to make those choices. Or it can be the same as a school bully - just for the power.
Didn't Americans recently discover that the answer to school shootings is to have guns in schools? Seems like the right direction
    The one upside to 2020, school shootings are way down
        *about to shoot myself in front of my class over zoom*

heh, keep tellin yourself that kid
            You ok?
                No, I miss being shot at so much that I'm shooting myself
He is Bede’s adoptive dad or something 

Basically the edgy rivals tend to have shit parents.
    Wait, Rose is Bede's adoptive son?
        Pretty sure it's the other way around (Oleana ad Bede are both "adopted" by Rose, but not like really adopted, he just gave them both a place to be and a purpose).
        Well, Rose just really endorsed Bede for the gym challenge because he saw good potential. They’re not related or anything.
No no the slightly better rival
The only thing she can catch is a Brock
    And a Squirtle. But then she just gives it to you
See, this take is why I really like the idea of what they were going for in S&S. And the fact that they didn't trust a young teenager to solve the world's problems. Simply mind-blowing idea, that young teenagers may be unfit for entrusting the future of the world with.
    I get that, I really do. But the sudden break away from this weird unrealistic thing they've been doing since the very first game was itself bizarre. At least add something else in its place if you're going to strip it out!
So PETA
    I've heard a conspiracy that PETA is actually funded by meat productors to make vegans/animal rights activists look ridiculous

Not gonna lie I wouldn't be surprised lol
        I love your flair
        I don't know about that, but the meat industry actually does a lot of work to spread shit about them. PETA does do some sketchy campaigns from time to time like blatant sexualisation of women, but also have a lot of accomplishments to their name on areas like animal testing.
The right to bear mons
    *I deserve the right to own as many Ursarings, Beartics, and Bewears in my house*
Pretty much. To swap out Pokemons for guns in the plot, Team Plasma was protesting that no one should have guns at all, which Ghetsis pushed so that only he and those he trusted would have guns to make the general populace easier to control. Any benevolence regarding the removal of guns from the general populace was merely a front.
    Wait... is this what Americans think of gun control?
    Sounds like the radical left in America.  (Before you start down voting, I said the *radical* left, not the normal left, of which I hope most of you are.)
this... is a perfect comparison
The way she applies pressure to her Poke Ball makes me anxious...
I second that opinion.
At least they don’t have to worry about getting scurvy
    Scraggy on the other hand
He was also a horribly abusive and manipulative father, so we weren't kidnapping his son as much as we were acting of behalf of CPS, which unsurprisingly, don't seem to exist in the world of Pokemon.
Nah, he was a straight up terrorist especially in BW2.
    He went from cult leader to terrorist
The champion wanted the chairman to wait, but the chairman has a God complex. He's also an anti-villain with far more sympathetic goals than most villains in Pokemon.
    He just got too excited and did it early. Not a bad bone there in his body
        Rose isn’t really a bad guy, he’s an antagonist. People often cite that as a flaw, but personally I think it’s a good mix up from gen 6’s villain, which is the absolute worst. Pokémon villains have never been good, but some were actually threatening a little bit, however I do think not including a villain, and instead having a man whose trying to do good, even if he has some (unconfirmed) mental complex, is a decent twist, it’s not good, but at least it’s different
            Yeah, I agree. He also encourages you to fix it, and wasn’t being malicious
No kidding, I'm still not completely certain if Bede is a boy or a girl
>No good person has that hairdo.

Or those shorts. 😫
    The shorts honestly made me think...no villain would wear those shorts, maybe he's not the villain!
        Oleana was acting a little shifty and I assumed she was gonna backstab but nope, she's loyal to a fault to a crazy jolly man.
Honestly he's an elderly lady at heart
My character has that hair 🙃
My favorite is XY by far
With arguably the best soundtrack in the whole game.
    With undeniably the **BEST** soundtrack in *every* game
Oh yeah... fuck that thing, I’ve fought it in USUM, and it’s the stuff of nightmares

    You're missing out. Try HGSS.
        (Sad no DS noises)
            You should try an emulator. HGSS is a masterpiece
            (Happy emulator noises)
                Does emulator work with BW and B2W2? Everyone seems to love those games
                    Depends on what emulator you are using. If you have an iPhone, for example, you could get NDS4ios. There are plenty of other options too.
                        I have OnePlus

Rip
                            I bought DraStic for my Note 10 since free emulators didn’t work with some games. It’s worth the ~$5 imo.
Ah, my mistake
I respectfully disagree, I love Sun and Moon.
    It’s just me I guess. The handholding mixed with the meh story and meh animations makes me not like it so much. Also I hated gen 7 VGC it was awful
        Yeah I don't follow the meta that much but I personally liked the story and characters. But yeah I definitely understand why a lot of people don't like it.
            I guess the root of it all for me is the gen 7 meta
Idk what is going on over there but they need to step up their game. Is it that we keep giving them money regardless of the quality? Maybe they're gotten complacent?
"Metal head with a badger"

Sounds like Piers and Obstagoon to me
    Yeah which I'm pretty sure isn't what happened. I thought it was Bede that caused Hop to get all sad. Maybe I'm remembering wrong though.
I don't disagree the SwSh have alot of problems/wasted potential, but I at least had fun playing the game despite my issues with it. The last several years the pokemon company had become very disconnected from its fanbase.
Oh alright. Forgot that oust was a word lol.
But totems were neat and I liked the multiple battles
Wow, I totally forgot about that. Wtf Team Rocket?
Correction 

The wrong ones pisses them off.

The correct ones pisses them off AND let's them use Primal Reversion
    Is that why they couldn’t do primal reversion in the originals? Because they got the orbs wrong?
        Yep. Can't power up with the wrong item, of course.
            Haha that means the error was on purpose!
                Or they just fucked it up and came up with a cool/broken reason to fix it in the remakes
                    Which is a pretty cool retcon as far as retcons go
                        Is it a retcon? Nothing about ORAS disproves anything in R/S, it doesnt day “that was wrong” it just says “this also is a thing” so it’s not really a retcon, more an expansion to plot
                    Maybe Maxie and Archie can't tell the difference between red and blue
                        Fun fact: Everyone in the Pokemon universe is colorblind.
                    I thought the opposite orbs was intentional.
        I think its because of what Zenna explains in the Post Game of OR/AS>!where the are basically two different "realities" - one without all the crazy transformation and travel stuff where the OG games primarily take place in which the Ultimate Weapon didn't get fired and very little came from outside the planet other than Deoxys, then the Universe where the Ultimate Weapon did get fired and all that stuff from space landed on the planet creating all the transforming craziness, altered forms etc. of Pokemon in which the new games take place.!<
            I’d love to see them expand on this idea
                They sort of did in USUM to fix up any more plot holes going with like, >!infinite realities/timelines exist, and Team Rainbow Rocket you defend the USUM timeline from, but then Giovanni backs off and decides to try and conquer other realities!<
                    I kinda totally forgot about this actually, despite having played through it. USUM feels like so long ago with how much controversy SWSH have strummed up
                I’m playing through Glazed right now and, while not canon at all, it explores this idea a bit. You switch between the Pokémon universe and our actual universe, where Pokémon is just a video game.
                    In several Pokemon games, Pokemon is a game. In FireRed and LeafGreen, they literally advertise the very games you are playing in the department store.
                        Sure, but I mean you travel between the two realities in this one and in one, there are cars and dogs and shit, like real life.
                    I’m pretty sure that’s just Digimon.
                        Don’t do this to me haha
                    Really that is cool
                    That sounds sick, I’ve only played a couple Pokémon ROM Hacks, I need to take a deep dive into it some time soon
                        I need to play more. I’ve done this one and one that is from the perspective of team rocket. Both are pretty solid. A good rom hack gives you that nostalgia as well as something a little fresh.
            I’m glad I’m not the only one who remembers this.
    ^('the ones' is plural, so it's 'the correct ones piss them off', like in the comment you responded to.)
        God damn it. I wrote it like that originally but thought it looked wrong so I changed it lol
I actually thought that was very clever but I have no idea if it was intentional or not
    did you make your account on opposite day
Yeah I knew that. I just didn't remember them getting the orbs right in the other "timeline". I definitely need to play the games again.
> In 1 timeline mega stones exist and in the other they don’t

More accurately would be that in 1 timeline mega stones are a common item and in the other are an exclusivity for Kalos
My name is John, and I'm the old elite 4 normal type leader.

I got kicked out
    At least you can take the Viridian gym now that Giovanni is gone- no wait that kid took it
        And that’s why he moved to Hoenn!
            Nah, that was because of the divorce.
        Maybe Giovanni was the old elite four member. Not responsible for maintaining the gym anymore, he committed more time to team rocket until your rival beats him, then becomes champion, which makes Lance the 4th member and sends Giovanni back to his gym. Perhaps the gym is locked before because they were still trying to find a new leader since Giovanni became part of the elite four?
            Not possible - how could Blue have got the 8th badge when there was no leader in Veridian?
                But we don’t know how long ago Blue got his eighth badge. Do we?
                    Can’t have been that much before Red. Blue and Red are hot on each other’s heels throughout the game. Giovanni wasn’t even back in Veridian that long before Red returned there and there was no gym leader there until Giovanni got back. Hence Blue could not have progressed to fight the Elite 4 until Giovanni was back.
    Hey, John. Screw you and your broken ass gen1 Tauros
    Just couldn’t give up the sauce, could ya, John?
        I almost beat him! But my Tauros missed the final hit :(
I feel like if there was a fourth member then we’d see him running out crying as we walk into the Pokémon league cause your rival beats lance literally right before you get there. Like lance is spamming his Pokémon with full restores when you walk in
    In Pokemon canon though aren’t pokemon supposed to have feelings and fatigue and stuff. 

So isn’t the rival beating Lance literally the second before we get there just him loosening the pickle jar for us?

Also wouldn’t Lance and the other elite 4 have also worked down the rival before we get there.
        You underestimate the Elite four’s power to spam full restores
There was no champion, only elite 4 members. Because both Red and Blue beat them, they battled each other for the Champion title.
    yeah i agree, there is no real "champion", just a person who defeated the elite four. then the next person to defeat the elite four has to battle the current champion for the title. its not like a job or anything.
        In a few of the games, being Champion is absolutely a job. Especially in the Unova Region, where it seems like the League has Political and Law Enforcement responsibilities, beyond simply running their gyms and testing trainers.
            Yeah, this came to mind after I just finished Ultra Sun last night. So you are the first champion of Alola and Hau already wants to challenge you again. There could be other challengers as well and you cannot really know when they will come. What if you took off to another region other than Alola? The planet can't be 4 islands can it?
Maybe Karen or Will?
    I think will would make the best sense since psychic was around for Red and Blue while Dark was added later
        Imagine a gen 1 psychic E4... Nightmares.
Yeah. The old fourth member got kicked out for racist tweets he made in 09
    and for that jinx-face in 04
    Blame it on the ambien.
I'm pretty sure it was mentioned that Lance was the fourth member and he was the champion, but because Blue beat him, there were now five members, the Elite 4 and the Champion.
    It started as just laurelei deciding she was the champion, then Bruno beat her and became the champion and she was the elite trainer.. Then Agatha beat them both and became the champion, and they were the elite Duo.. And so on
        Ah, the reverse Bink's Sake
Giovanni, maybe? Not only is he the next strongest gym trainer, but it would also explain why he was away at first.
    Wasn't he away because he was running the pokemafia? Seems unlikely that he was a gym leader, elite 4 and mob boss.
        That'd be an impressive resumé though
        Hell, he could become potus.
            ...now I want a Pokémon game set in the United States

... during the Civil War
                Native Americans riding ponytas and tauros. Fuck yeah.
    Damn, I just left a whole theory about this in this thread too.
Oh my god it’s been twenty years and I never noticed this. It’s literally the only gen where it happens. That’s so weird and it’s going to bug me forever now.
    I always imagined the Elite 4 were the same as they are in the game, and the Champion before Blue was someone else, possibly his own grandfather.
        Professor Oak wasn't the Champion before Blue. Remember, "I came when I *heard* you'd beaten the Elite Four."

Whoever Blue beat to become Champion wasn't his grandfather, because Blue is Champion before Oak hears about it.
            Right, never mind.
    Nah, happens in the Alola games too, except you’re the first champion and have to defend your title immediately.
No lance was a part of the elite four, there just hadn’t been anyone who managed to clear the gauntlet before blue yet. In GSC Lance does become champion, but not necessarily because red leaves. He took on the new elite four to become champion himself. I guess Lorelei left and he saw his chance 😂
Or maybe there was but the last one chose not to defend his/her title for some reason.
That makes most sense.
You are Red in Gen 1.
If that’s true, the mystery is solved.
Correction, it's YAVELTAL GOD OF DARKNESS AND DEATH
    Ah yes, pokemon talk. What the fuck happened to the floor?
        It got killed by the floor tenticals
            There's some conspiracy theory going on that says the floor tentacles were made by some foreign Dragonite
            FUCK THATS HOT SH*T SH*T SH*T
    Ah, I see you are a man of culture as well
        Yes I am

    I absolutely hate this sentence cuz of the recent controversies so.....

**yvetal ha ha**
        Please elaborate
            I also require elaboration.
                I believe he means 'Yveltal' to potentially trigger the ManjTV fans who say 'Yahvaltal', but I am not entirely 100% sure myself.
                    Not trigger the fans, I just don’t really like Michael anymore after the recent controversies. Hold on let me get the explanation:

Jubilee lied about other YouTubers defending a pedophile over a year ago. Everyone involved in the situation told Jubilee she was lying and she doubled down at first. Michael retweeted/liked her statements. In his apology, for the both of them, admitted to doing wrong but didn’t admit that from the beginning they were lying for no reason. Now people are trying to claim Jubilee is controlling Michael and forcing him to say and do these things. However Michael has a long history of agreeing with the comments Jubilee makes for years at this point. So in the end, there is no one did more than the other. They both are in the wrong and still have not fully acknowledged that.
                        Thanks for the elaboration friend
                    *my name*

*is yahvaltal*

But jokes aside I guess that makes sense.
    I see you are a man of culture as well
I read it as toothpaste deer and was like Xerneas looks like a toothpaste?

Then I remembered Zygarde lmao
This was my interpretation as well.
Ehh, eternal life can be a curse as well. There's a SCP where everything on earth is cursed to never die. Its gets real fucking shitty, cause eternal life doesn't mean eternal healing
    Of course it's a curse, look at AZ and how much he suffered wandering the world for 3000 years, and its not like he is some cryptid, people know of him they just choose to ignore him.
    Can you link the SCP? I want to read it!
        https://youtu.be/9dLYnrXrjss

This is how I found about it, pretty sure he has a link to it if you just want to read
Eternal Life = Overpopulation
    Only if it passes down genetically. You just have to watch your children die while you live forever.
Trust me. Eternal life would be more of a distopia for the majority of people.
Tree of Life. It is somewhat surprising how easy it can be to miss.
    It not being a grass type helps
        It's basically the same as the deer God thing from Princess Mononoke.
        It really should be. Grass is weak to Flying, Dark is weak to Fairy, it would make them more even
            It would also help make it not stupidly broken in VGC as well. Giving it a 4x weakness + fire and flying would make Geomancy not seem as op.
What is it with this game and things that look like trees but aren't trees

            i loved that so much back then. still love it today
the legendaries have crazy entries in general, most of them sound terrifying.
giratina isn’t satan, it’s just the Pokémon equivalent.

it was banished for being too violent, and it’s the “renegade” Pokémon. Satan was banished for pride not violence but both were banished for abuse of power (just in different ways).

Giratina is more of the “rouge rebel” Pokémon than the “satan” Pokémon but satan is pretty much the embodiment of rebellion and defiance.

You’re right, they’re not the same. but they share a ton of similarities.
    no, giratina is neither satan, nor it's pokémon equivalent

it also wasn't violent, it caused harm to spacetime by it's mere existence, so it was was stored away safely into another reality where it couldn't cause any harm to the real world.

also, satan was not banished for pride but for opposing the evil sky dictatos decree. not out of pride, but out of a sense of justice. or maybe i'm confusing him with melek taus. i do get their stories mixed up at times.
        yes it was violent, it’s literal Pokédex entry is:
“It was banished for its violence. It silently gazed upon the old world from the Distortion World.”

God banished Satan because “wickedness found him” and he later says “Your heart became proud on account of your beauty, and you corrupted your wisdom because of your splendor. So I threw you to earth; I made a spectacle of you before kings.” 

satan was banished for pride and corruption. 

* both rebels
* both banished 
* both are made from god and punished for their nature

there is no “satan” Pokémon but giratina is the closest example. If it’s not the equivalent, then what is? 

It’s the “renegade” Pokémon and satan was the first renegade in Christian beliefs.
That's a nice deer you got there. Sure would be a shame if some paintbrush sloth gave it Grass typing.
    Not that saying it looks like a sloth is untrue, but if you mean Smeargle it's based on a beagle dog, hence the name
        I legitimately didn't know that. Thank you for enlightening me to the existence of Paintbrush Snoopy.
            No problem! I think the fact that there's always more to learn about the Pokemon world is what made it so interesting to me as a kid
A fellow MandJTV fan I see
What did Lysandre do? Hate bad fashion?
    Want to murder 90% of the human population and 100% of Pokémon.
        If I somehow existed in a pokemon world and someone wanted to kill all of the pokemon they would have to start with me. Pokemon being real is my wildest fantasy and if I got it I would defend it.
    Lysandre read a lot of Ayn Rand in college and just ran with it
        Holy fuck this is funny 

But looking at the state of the world today, he’s not wrong
    I think he was Pokemon’s Thanos.
        But with crappier motivations
Just shoot the planet with a giant space laser. It's not like it can get any worse.
    he was mad xy was left unfinished
True, but even then, the patterns on the orbs were the same patterns on the corresponding legendary. You think they'd make that connection at least.
    The pattern only existed in ORAS. [In RSE/the anime](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Red_Orb#Appearance), it was literally just a red orb with nothing on it. However, reading the bulbapedia post, Team M/A actually did grab the wrong orb. I guess I was wrong all this time. I played Sapphire so long ago, I could've sworn the old couple said both orbs were needed and Archie only grabbed one.
I actually want to praise the director USUM. It's like he heard that the fans were complaining about the games being too easy and had a field day with it.
    And then they removed him and had Ohmori back for Sword and Shield so it became too easy again.
I agree
Similar Plan. Had a Focus Sash Incineroar use Devastating Drake after surviving Power Gem, then had a Noivern live one HP to give Dragon Pulse,and Swampert dodge Prismatic Laser to give Earthquake. the last 2 were Affectionate, and I relished that Saturday Morning.
Thanks man! Damn another year I didn’t even realize!
We don’t really have any motivation other than being powerful though

We just happen to stop whatever scheme is afoot and don’t really have any ideology
    We choose to though and the main story can allow you to make those choices. Or it can be the same as a school bully - just for the power.
The one upside to 2020, school shootings are way down
    *about to shoot myself in front of my class over zoom*

heh, keep tellin yourself that kid
        You ok?
            No, I miss being shot at so much that I'm shooting myself
Wait, Rose is Bede's adoptive son?
    Pretty sure it's the other way around (Oleana ad Bede are both "adopted" by Rose, but not like really adopted, he just gave them both a place to be and a purpose).
    Well, Rose just really endorsed Bede for the gym challenge because he saw good potential. They’re not related or anything.
And a Squirtle. But then she just gives it to you
I get that, I really do. But the sudden break away from this weird unrealistic thing they've been doing since the very first game was itself bizarre. At least add something else in its place if you're going to strip it out!
I've heard a conspiracy that PETA is actually funded by meat productors to make vegans/animal rights activists look ridiculous

Not gonna lie I wouldn't be surprised lol
    I love your flair
    I don't know about that, but the meat industry actually does a lot of work to spread shit about them. PETA does do some sketchy campaigns from time to time like blatant sexualisation of women, but also have a lot of accomplishments to their name on areas like animal testing.
*I deserve the right to own as many Ursarings, Beartics, and Bewears in my house*
Wait... is this what Americans think of gun control?
Sounds like the radical left in America.  (Before you start down voting, I said the *radical* left, not the normal left, of which I hope most of you are.)
Scraggy on the other hand
He went from cult leader to terrorist
He just got too excited and did it early. Not a bad bone there in his body
    Rose isn’t really a bad guy, he’s an antagonist. People often cite that as a flaw, but personally I think it’s a good mix up from gen 6’s villain, which is the absolute worst. Pokémon villains have never been good, but some were actually threatening a little bit, however I do think not including a villain, and instead having a man whose trying to do good, even if he has some (unconfirmed) mental complex, is a decent twist, it’s not good, but at least it’s different
        Yeah, I agree. He also encourages you to fix it, and wasn’t being malicious
The shorts honestly made me think...no villain would wear those shorts, maybe he's not the villain!
    Oleana was acting a little shifty and I assumed she was gonna backstab but nope, she's loyal to a fault to a crazy jolly man.
With undeniably the **BEST** soundtrack in *every* game
You're missing out. Try HGSS.
    (Sad no DS noises)
        You should try an emulator. HGSS is a masterpiece
        (Happy emulator noises)
            Does emulator work with BW and B2W2? Everyone seems to love those games
                Depends on what emulator you are using. If you have an iPhone, for example, you could get NDS4ios. There are plenty of other options too.
                    I have OnePlus

Rip
                        I bought DraStic for my Note 10 since free emulators didn’t work with some games. It’s worth the ~$5 imo.
It’s just me I guess. The handholding mixed with the meh story and meh animations makes me not like it so much. Also I hated gen 7 VGC it was awful
    Yeah I don't follow the meta that much but I personally liked the story and characters. But yeah I definitely understand why a lot of people don't like it.
        I guess the root of it all for me is the gen 7 meta
Yeah which I'm pretty sure isn't what happened. I thought it was Bede that caused Hop to get all sad. Maybe I'm remembering wrong though.
Is that why they couldn’t do primal reversion in the originals? Because they got the orbs wrong?
    Yep. Can't power up with the wrong item, of course.
        Haha that means the error was on purpose!
            Or they just fucked it up and came up with a cool/broken reason to fix it in the remakes
                Which is a pretty cool retcon as far as retcons go
                    Is it a retcon? Nothing about ORAS disproves anything in R/S, it doesnt day “that was wrong” it just says “this also is a thing” so it’s not really a retcon, more an expansion to plot
                Maybe Maxie and Archie can't tell the difference between red and blue
                    Fun fact: Everyone in the Pokemon universe is colorblind.
                I thought the opposite orbs was intentional.
    I think its because of what Zenna explains in the Post Game of OR/AS>!where the are basically two different "realities" - one without all the crazy transformation and travel stuff where the OG games primarily take place in which the Ultimate Weapon didn't get fired and very little came from outside the planet other than Deoxys, then the Universe where the Ultimate Weapon did get fired and all that stuff from space landed on the planet creating all the transforming craziness, altered forms etc. of Pokemon in which the new games take place.!<
        I’d love to see them expand on this idea
            They sort of did in USUM to fix up any more plot holes going with like, >!infinite realities/timelines exist, and Team Rainbow Rocket you defend the USUM timeline from, but then Giovanni backs off and decides to try and conquer other realities!<
                I kinda totally forgot about this actually, despite having played through it. USUM feels like so long ago with how much controversy SWSH have strummed up
            I’m playing through Glazed right now and, while not canon at all, it explores this idea a bit. You switch between the Pokémon universe and our actual universe, where Pokémon is just a video game.
                In several Pokemon games, Pokemon is a game. In FireRed and LeafGreen, they literally advertise the very games you are playing in the department store.
                    Sure, but I mean you travel between the two realities in this one and in one, there are cars and dogs and shit, like real life.
                I’m pretty sure that’s just Digimon.
                    Don’t do this to me haha
                Really that is cool
                That sounds sick, I’ve only played a couple Pokémon ROM Hacks, I need to take a deep dive into it some time soon
                    I need to play more. I’ve done this one and one that is from the perspective of team rocket. Both are pretty solid. A good rom hack gives you that nostalgia as well as something a little fresh.
        I’m glad I’m not the only one who remembers this.
^('the ones' is plural, so it's 'the correct ones piss them off', like in the comment you responded to.)
    God damn it. I wrote it like that originally but thought it looked wrong so I changed it lol
did you make your account on opposite day
At least you can take the Viridian gym now that Giovanni is gone- no wait that kid took it
    And that’s why he moved to Hoenn!
        Nah, that was because of the divorce.
    Maybe Giovanni was the old elite four member. Not responsible for maintaining the gym anymore, he committed more time to team rocket until your rival beats him, then becomes champion, which makes Lance the 4th member and sends Giovanni back to his gym. Perhaps the gym is locked before because they were still trying to find a new leader since Giovanni became part of the elite four?
        Not possible - how could Blue have got the 8th badge when there was no leader in Veridian?
            But we don’t know how long ago Blue got his eighth badge. Do we?
                Can’t have been that much before Red. Blue and Red are hot on each other’s heels throughout the game. Giovanni wasn’t even back in Veridian that long before Red returned there and there was no gym leader there until Giovanni got back. Hence Blue could not have progressed to fight the Elite 4 until Giovanni was back.
Hey, John. Screw you and your broken ass gen1 Tauros
Just couldn’t give up the sauce, could ya, John?
    I almost beat him! But my Tauros missed the final hit :(
In Pokemon canon though aren’t pokemon supposed to have feelings and fatigue and stuff. 

So isn’t the rival beating Lance literally the second before we get there just him loosening the pickle jar for us?

Also wouldn’t Lance and the other elite 4 have also worked down the rival before we get there.
    You underestimate the Elite four’s power to spam full restores
yeah i agree, there is no real "champion", just a person who defeated the elite four. then the next person to defeat the elite four has to battle the current champion for the title. its not like a job or anything.
    In a few of the games, being Champion is absolutely a job. Especially in the Unova Region, where it seems like the League has Political and Law Enforcement responsibilities, beyond simply running their gyms and testing trainers.
        Yeah, this came to mind after I just finished Ultra Sun last night. So you are the first champion of Alola and Hau already wants to challenge you again. There could be other challengers as well and you cannot really know when they will come. What if you took off to another region other than Alola? The planet can't be 4 islands can it?
I think will would make the best sense since psychic was around for Red and Blue while Dark was added later
    Imagine a gen 1 psychic E4... Nightmares.
and for that jinx-face in 04
Blame it on the ambien.
It started as just laurelei deciding she was the champion, then Bruno beat her and became the champion and she was the elite trainer.. Then Agatha beat them both and became the champion, and they were the elite Duo.. And so on
    Ah, the reverse Bink's Sake

                Is it a retcon? Nothing about ORAS disproves anything in R/S, it doesnt day “that was wrong” it just says “this also is a thing” so it’s not really a retcon, more an expansion to plot
            Maybe Maxie and Archie can't tell the difference between red and blue
                Fun fact: Everyone in the Pokemon universe is colorblind.
            I thought the opposite orbs was intentional.
I think its because of what Zenna explains in the Post Game of OR/AS>!where the are basically two different "realities" - one without all the crazy transformation and travel stuff where the OG games primarily take place in which the Ultimate Weapon didn't get fired and very little came from outside the planet other than Deoxys, then the Universe where the Ultimate Weapon did get fired and all that stuff from space landed on the planet creating all the transforming craziness, altered forms etc. of Pokemon in which the new games take place.!<
    I’d love to see them expand on this idea
        They sort of did in USUM to fix up any more plot holes going with like, >!infinite realities/timelines exist, and Team Rainbow Rocket you defend the USUM timeline from, but then Giovanni backs off and decides to try and conquer other realities!<
            I kinda totally forgot about this actually, despite having played through it. USUM feels like so long ago with how much controversy SWSH have strummed up
        I’m playing through Glazed right now and, while not canon at all, it explores this idea a bit. You switch between the Pokémon universe and our actual universe, where Pokémon is just a video game.
            In several Pokemon games, Pokemon is a game. In FireRed and LeafGreen, they literally advertise the very games you are playing in the department store.
                Sure, but I mean you travel between the two realities in this one and in one, there are cars and dogs and shit, like real life.
            I’m pretty sure that’s just Digimon.
                Don’t do this to me haha
            Really that is cool
            That sounds sick, I’ve only played a couple Pokémon ROM Hacks, I need to take a deep dive into it some time soon
                I need to play more. I’ve done this one and one that is from the perspective of team rocket. Both are pretty solid. A good rom hack gives you that nostalgia as well as something a little fresh.
    I’m glad I’m not the only one who remembers this.
God damn it. I wrote it like that originally but thought it looked wrong so I changed it lol
And that’s why he moved to Hoenn!
    Nah, that was because of the divorce.
Maybe Giovanni was the old elite four member. Not responsible for maintaining the gym anymore, he committed more time to team rocket until your rival beats him, then becomes champion, which makes Lance the 4th member and sends Giovanni back to his gym. Perhaps the gym is locked before because they were still trying to find a new leader since Giovanni became part of the elite four?
    Not possible - how could Blue have got the 8th badge when there was no leader in Veridian?
        But we don’t know how long ago Blue got his eighth badge. Do we?
            Can’t have been that much before Red. Blue and Red are hot on each other’s heels throughout the game. Giovanni wasn’t even back in Veridian that long before Red returned there and there was no gym leader there until Giovanni got back. Hence Blue could not have progressed to fight the Elite 4 until Giovanni was back.
I almost beat him! But my Tauros missed the final hit :(
You underestimate the Elite four’s power to spam full restores
In a few of the games, being Champion is absolutely a job. Especially in the Unova Region, where it seems like the League has Political and Law Enforcement responsibilities, beyond simply running their gyms and testing trainers.
    Yeah, this came to mind after I just finished Ultra Sun last night. So you are the first champion of Alola and Hau already wants to challenge you again. There could be other challengers as well and you cannot really know when they will come. What if you took off to another region other than Alola? The planet can't be 4 islands can it?
Imagine a gen 1 psychic E4... Nightmares.
Ah, the reverse Bink's Sake
That'd be an impressive resumé though
Hell, he could become potus.
    ...now I want a Pokémon game set in the United States

... during the Civil War
        Native Americans riding ponytas and tauros. Fuck yeah.
Professor Oak wasn't the Champion before Blue. Remember, "I came when I *heard* you'd beaten the Elite Four."

Whoever Blue beat to become Champion wasn't his grandfather, because Blue is Champion before Oak hears about it.
    Right, never mind.
It got killed by the floor tenticals
    There's some conspiracy theory going on that says the floor tentacles were made by some foreign Dragonite
    FUCK THATS HOT SH*T SH*T SH*T
Yes I am
Bröther
Please elaborate
    I also require elaboration.
        I believe he means 'Yveltal' to potentially trigger the ManjTV fans who say 'Yahvaltal', but I am not entirely 100% sure myself.
            Not trigger the fans, I just don’t really like Michael anymore after the recent controversies. Hold on let me get the explanation:

Jubilee lied about other YouTubers defending a pedophile over a year ago. Everyone involved in the situation told Jubilee she was lying and she doubled down at first. Michael retweeted/liked her statements. In his apology, for the both of them, admitted to doing wrong but didn’t admit that from the beginning they were lying for no reason. Now people are trying to claim Jubilee is controlling Michael and forcing him to say and do these things. However Michael has a long history of agreeing with the comments Jubilee makes for years at this point. So in the end, there is no one did more than the other. They both are in the wrong and still have not fully acknowledged that.
                Thanks for the elaboration friend
            *my name*

*is yahvaltal*

But jokes aside I guess that makes sense.

This is how I found about it, pretty sure he has a link to it if you just want to read
It's basically the same as the deer God thing from Princess Mononoke.
It really should be. Grass is weak to Flying, Dark is weak to Fairy, it would make them more even
    It would also help make it not stupidly broken in VGC as well. Giving it a 4x weakness + fire and flying would make Geomancy not seem as op.
Bonsai + Lie
    Or bon-Sly
        Bons-lie
    Holy fuck
    No. Way.
Also the ninja kids in Ruby/Sapphire who hide behind cardboard cutouts of trees
    i loved that so much back then. still love it today
yes it was violent, it’s literal Pokédex entry is:
“It was banished for its violence. It silently gazed upon the old world from the Distortion World.”

God banished Satan because “wickedness found him” and he later says “Your heart became proud on account of your beauty, and you corrupted your wisdom because of your splendor. So I threw you to earth; I made a spectacle of you before kings.” 

satan was banished for pride and corruption. 

* both rebels
* both banished 
* both are made from god and punished for their nature

there is no “satan” Pokémon but giratina is the closest example. If it’s not the equivalent, then what is? 

It’s the “renegade” Pokémon and satan was the first renegade in Christian beliefs.
I legitimately didn't know that. Thank you for enlightening me to the existence of Paintbrush Snoopy.
    No problem! I think the fact that there's always more to learn about the Pokemon world is what made it so interesting to me as a kid
If I somehow existed in a pokemon world and someone wanted to kill all of the pokemon they would have to start with me. Pokemon being real is my wildest fantasy and if I got it I would defend it.
Holy fuck this is funny 

But looking at the state of the world today, he’s not wrong
But with crappier motivations
You ok?
    No, I miss being shot at so much that I'm shooting myself
Yeah, I agree. He also encourages you to fix it, and wasn’t being malicious
You should try an emulator. HGSS is a masterpiece
(Happy emulator noises)
    Does emulator work with BW and B2W2? Everyone seems to love those games
        Depends on what emulator you are using. If you have an iPhone, for example, you could get NDS4ios. There are plenty of other options too.
            I have OnePlus

Rip
                I bought DraStic for my Note 10 since free emulators didn’t work with some games. It’s worth the ~$5 imo.
I guess the root of it all for me is the gen 7 meta
Haha that means the error was on purpose!
