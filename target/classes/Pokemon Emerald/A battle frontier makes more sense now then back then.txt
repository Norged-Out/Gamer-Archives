[[A battle frontier makes more sense now then back then]]


That's what sting more about their absence, though it was fun it was admittedly nearly impossible to actually beat them purely with just the PokÃ©mon you used in the journey, unless you go out of your way to actually start ev training, egg hatching, and all that.

today, with teambuilding way being easier and will probably be more easier as time goes on, this would have been the coolest way to test your competive build PokÃ©mon offline, or just have an actual challenge for your level 100, modest nature, 5iv, unaware skelidurge outside of online.


Yes! A Battle Frontier could be even better now than it was in the older games. Not only because of the more accessible breeding, but also because of the more widespread multiplayer. Imagine having multi battles with your friend in the different facilities or being able to play with battle facility rules against players online. 

Instead, we don't even get a basic freaking Battle Tower anymore. Even having repeatable double battles is now too much to ask in the base game. They completely ruined the post game battling aspect of Pokemon, and raids are not a satisfying replacement for it. They are a neat little extra mode to have fun with, but I want fun and creative Battle Facilities.
    A ranked Battle Royale mode with friends would be hilarious
It's insane that Gamefreak didn't put out a free to play battle simulator like Pokemon Battle Revolution. They could monetize the hell out of outfits AND have a space to include all pokemon so nothing is trapped in Home.
    That's a suggested I've always had. It would probably be marketed as a new PokÃ©mon Stadium game

        I need this game so bad
            I do too
    I think it should just be part of HOME tbh.
Battle facilities have always been my favorite part of PokÃ©mon, and not having anything in SV makes these some of the most disappointing games for me. I would be happy with just the battle tower from SW/SH at the very least, better than nothing.
You know youâ€™ve really gotta appreciate Game Freak. Fans have been asking them to bring back the Battle Frontier for over a decade now and not just keep giving us a reskinned Battle Tower. So, like all good game studios these days, they heard their fans and decided to cut out the Battle Tower entirely so nobody could complain that they just keep reskinning it. How thoughtful of them
It's weird to me that game freak's reason for not implementing one is that they feel like people don't care and that the young people won't want to play it but pretty much every other day I see a thread somewhere about someone begging for it to come back and the whole thing about the kids is ridiculous too because if there's anything kids love these days it's content. Lots and lots of content and the Battle Frontier would absolutely deliver that with its replayability.

So I don't know, either game freak is out of touch which makes me sad as someone who's been dedicated to this series since day one or they're lazy which also makes me feel sad. Hopefully it's some secret third thing that can be solved/if it's the other two things maybe that can be solved too.

I mean, thatâ€™s probably the big thing here: Back in 2005, people couldnâ€™t just press a few buttons and be connected with actual humans to compete against. The Battle Frontier was something that gave people a way to keep using and training PokÃ©mon even after beating the game, because otherwise there just wouldnâ€™t be much to do once you became the Champion. Itâ€™s 5-7 massive facilities that require a ton of breeding and preparation and dealing with Game Freakâ€™s extremely obscurantist mechanics to even be able to challenge effectively, and then the goal is to rack up long unbroken streaks at each facility. Itâ€™s designed to be a gigantic time sink.

While I agree that it would be more fun to have battle facilities like that in an age where making competitive-level PokÃ©mon has become vastly more streamlined and accessible, Iâ€™m not really surprised that the developers would see those improvements in accessibility as a complement to directing people toward the actual competitive scene instead.
    Yeah, the more accessible online battles are a neat little excuse for GameFreak to not do single player post game battle content anymore. It probably cost more time than they have, considering they can't even get all the basics done in their games anymore.

But online battles obviously can't be an adequate replacement for Battle Facilities. You don't have the creative rule sets, you don't have the cool unique character designs for bosses, you don't have this endless win streak run kinda feel, and battling against actual players can be stressful, frustrating (in a different way than Battle Facilities, who also can be frustrating of course :D) and definitely is entirely different from battling NPCs.

It's just sad that this part that used to be one of the games' strength is just entirely neglected now.
        Another reason why online battles can't be an adequate replacement: When the game's online isn't supported, there will be nothing to do with your Pokemon after clearing the story. 

Even nowadays people continue to do Battle Factory streams for the DS games, showing that they still have strong longevity outside of transferring Pokemon from them to newer games. For the 3DS Pokemon games there's hardly anything to do with your Pokemon after clearing the story now that online battles aren't a thing. You've got all this Pokemon you can catch but the only thing to do with them is a Battle Tower clone (a downgrade from the repeatable content we had in the GBA and DS games).
        Battle facilities are a good in between of the challenge of online play and the RPG fun of end game content. I play a lot of VGC but it's different to trying to beat an in game achievement.
    I agree that online connectivity is easier than it was 15 years ago. But it's kind of behind a paywall, which is not particularly good game design.
    I remember attempting the 7 different challenges in the battle frontier in emerald for hours and hours and I think i only got 1 badge. It was actually super hard (at least for 5th grade me without any help from outside the game). I didnt know what IV, EV, nature etc did back then. All I knew was that my swampert was level 100.
I agree completely, i have 700 hours in Soulsilver breeding pokemon for the frontier and fighting. Itâ€™s a fun endless arcade mode. The problem is itâ€™s not kid-friendly at all, so naturally it got axed
I think in the next games they should include a Battle Frontier like location that would be accessible both offline and online. Instead of doing raids or dens they could have like weekly challenges at the different rotating facilities for people to collect the badges like in Emerald. This way people can collect offline and online versions of the badges, and with the venue changing it would switch up the rules. 

I enjoy doing the Tera raids, but I hate building up a PokÃ©mon just for a specific raid and then never using it again. I also hate that theyâ€™re usually time sensitive and offered the same days. I usually work weekends and so I have to rush to complete it on Thursday night or Iâ€™d miss out on the PokÃ©mon.
I don't need a full Battle Frontier, but give me casual and ranked 3v3 single and 4v4 double battles. Give me battles with random effects each round. Give me rental battles. Give me 1v1 battles. They don't need to be CPU opponents, I'm just tired of basic battles as the only format online.
I've been trying to beat the battle tree in USUM the past few months and it makes me sad that battle frontiers and facilities have gone exctinct.

It's really fun putting together new teams to take on harder challenges, and it could be done easier than ever.

While the Frontiers would be missing the fun of a national dex, there's still a lot they could do to keep things fresh.

* Nuzlocke Tower: pokemon faints and it leaves your party

* Inverse Tower: all battles use flipped type effectiveness charts

* Puzzle Tower: using fixed pokemon and moves to win in a set number of turns. This could be a good place to tutorialize advanced plays like Gravity + Hypnosis
The time is ripe for a Stadium 3 game with Home functionality. They don't want to put challenging postgame into the main series? Fine. Just have Stadium 3 and update with the new monsters every now and then. That way we also have a place to use our old teams that can't all go into a single game anymore.
I miss being able to do multi battles with either an npc or your friend in the battle tower. My brother and I used to love working together in multi battles. I also loved seeing various npcs I had met throughout the game be available to team up with.
I'd love an updated version of the Stadium games instead if we don't get battle towers or facilities in the games anymore. I feel much more incentive to try out different pokemon and strategies that I otherwise wouldn't be able to in an online meta.
i hope the SV DLC will give us something like the battle frontier in the second part of the DLC, it would make too much sense not to do it

and while they are at it, bring back megas for some post game fun
The Battle Frontier is good for many things, but the core reason for its existence only lasted for about two generations.  In a time before online battles, if you wanted to push your team to their limits and maximize their battle prowess there weren't really many options for you to test yourself.  If you didn't have friends on the same level as you, there'd be nobody worth fighting.

So the Battle Frontier was designed to give even these madlads a fair challenge, to make their teambuilding and battle strategy rewarding by letting them face down and beat actually difficult opponents.  For a while, it was the only way you could get an experience even remotely like that.

Until Gen 4 introduced global wi-fi, anyways.  Now you can just directly challenge other trainers online, and prove the strength of your team the old fashioned way by defeating other real humans.  The Battle Frontier's core purpose was now vestigial, and as we've seen over the years competitive Pokemon just got bigger and bigger.

What's worse, for competitive players the BP items made the Battle Frontier a mandatory annoyance rather than an intrinsically enjoyable experience.  If you want to get in shape to play online, you have to first play the "lesser" version of competitive battling for a few hours until you're allowed to buy all the items you need.  I saw a lot of people voice happiness that Scarlet and Violet let you just buy everything with ordinary currencies, even as they lamented the absence of the Frontier itself.

The Battle Frontier is still a great institution, I feel.  Even with competitive battling existing there's no other way to get an experience like the Battle Factory or Battle Pike, and those game modes lend so much charm and variety to the high-level Pokemon battling experience.  But once Gen 4 hit shelves and online competitive took over, the Battle Frontier got increasingly sidelined as just another obligatory mechanic they're shoving in the game because everyone expects it to be there.

If I'm being honest, it's not the Battle Tower that I miss, the gauntlets of ordinary fights one after another, but the exciting other facilities that do truly unique things.  And those were already long dead by the time Gen 9 cut the frontier entirely.  I can't say it's not a big loss, but I'd more say that we had already lost the Frontier years ago and this is just the final aftershock kicking in.
I beat the Battle Dome in Emerald with my team.
Than*
I hope every new release that it will come back
I've beaten most battle frontiers but one thing I don't like about them is how long it takes to build a streak. Hours to build a streak just to get frozen and lose. Competitive is more accessible but I hope they find a way to make it feel less like a commitment
The one thing I want is a way to test your team in a battle facility that does 6v6 battles.
Iâ€™ve logged so many hours between platinum and heartgold into the battle factory. Having a modern version with all the new PokÃ©mon would be a dream come true.
