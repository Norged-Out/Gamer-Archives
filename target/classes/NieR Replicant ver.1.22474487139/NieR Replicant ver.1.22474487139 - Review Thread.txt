**[Digitally Downloaded](https://opencritic.com/outlet/65/digitally-downloaded)** - [5 / 5 stars](https://www.digitallydownloaded.net/2021/04/review-nier-replicant-ver122474487139.html)

>Regardless of the protagonist, NieR is a remarkable piece of art, and this remaster touches up the issues people had with the original without compromising what made it such an impactful work. It’s going to be interesting to see if people give it the look that it deserves this time around, because this really is the greatest game of all time, and has always deserved more than “cult” status.

**[Noisy Pixel](https://opencritic.com/outlet/711/noisy-pixel)** - [Jacob Kavanaugh](https://opencritic.com/critic/6421/jacob-kavanaugh) - [10 / 10](https://noisypixel.net/nier-replicant-review-ps4-xbox-one-pc/)

>Nier: Replicant ver.1.22474487139… is a beautiful experience and exactly how you should play this amazing game. Upon finishing, it’s easy to say that it is unequivocally one of the best games I have ever played. This story emotionally moves players with the help of its character-writing, intense action, and somber tone, making it easy to immerse yourself in their world.

**[Saudi Gamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/455/saudi-gamer)** - *Arabic* - [10 / 10](https://saudigamer.com/review/nier-replicant-ver-1-22474487139/)

>An ambitious game with a big heart, that makes up for its limited budget with a plethora of ideas and characters and stories, and a remaster that does more than spruce up a classic. A must-play for those who played the original as well as those whose introduction to the series was with Automata.

-------------

**[TheGamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/731/thegamer)** - [Andrea Shearon](https://opencritic.com/critic/1920/andrea-shearon) - [5 / 5 stars](https://www.thegamer.com/nier-replicant-remake-review/)

>When I wrapped up my experience with Nier Replicant, I realized it was the most satisfied I’d ever felt after working so hard for a particular ending. Yoko Taro asking me to relive the same experiences again and again wasn’t a repetitive journey, but a more meaningful reflection on a cycle of hate, pain, and trauma. Nier Replicant is Yoko Taro’s best work, brought up to modern standards, and finally delivered in the presentation its tale always deserved.

>An improvement in every sense, NieR Replicant is an absolute blast. You'll love the characters, the world and every little detail you can think of. Prepare yourself for another one of Yoko Taro's wonderful, yet emotional, rollercoaster rides.

>NieR Replicant ver.1.22474487139… is a wonderful opportunity to meet and enjoy a game that deserves to break out of its niche status, as its formidable sequel has done. I take my hat off to the restoration work, as well as I praise that the original experience is so direct, with the edges that may be there at certain points such as the scarcity of scenarios and areas of action. But by being so respectful in his excellent job of updating, many more players enjoy in a more fluid and improved way something that goes beyond the action-RPG or Japanese cult title.

>NieR Replicant ver. 1.22474487139… is the perfect opportunity to experiment NieR Automata's prequel. An epic game with a lot of improvements.

**[CGMagazine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/82/cgmagazine)** - [Zubi Khan](https://opencritic.com/critic/4059/zubi-khan) - [9 / 10](https://www.cgmagonline.com/reviews/nier-replicant/)

>If nothing else, NieR: Replicant Ver. 1.22474487139 is a unique game even when held in contrast with its 2017 follow-up and a must-play for both fans of the original and those looking for something a little darker than a Final Fantasy or any number of anime-inspired JRPG titles.

**[GRYOnline.pl](https://opencritic.com/outlet/559/gryonline-pl)** - [Michał Grygorcewicz](https://opencritic.com/critic/4438/micha-grygorcewicz) - *Polish* - [9 / 10](https://www.gry-online.pl/S020.asp?ID=14457)

>NieR Replicant ver.1.22474487139... is what that the original should have been from the start. A more polished and expanded game with an improved combat system while keeping the stunning aspects of the old NieR. If I were to rate this game only from a die-hard fan's perspective, I would give it an even higher score.

**[Game Revolution](https://opencritic.com/outlet/93/game-revolution)** - [Jason Faulkner](https://opencritic.com/critic/448/jason-faulkner) - [9 / 10](https://www.gamerevolution.com/review/679243-nier-replicant-ver-1-22-review-ps4-xbox-one-pc)

>Nier Replicant ver. 1.22 is an excellent spin on the traditional hero’s journey and will give Nier Automata fans a new appreciation for that title. It’s a lovingly crafted rerelease and will delight both new and old players alike.

-------------

**[GameMAG](https://opencritic.com/outlet/459/gamemag)** - *Russian* - [9 / 10](https://gamemag.ru/reviews/nier-replicant-ver-1-22474487139)

>And now it is time for NieR Replicant ver.1.22474487139…, which corrects almost all the flaws of the original release. You can still easily see glimpses of old NieR here - it's almost the same exact game. And that's great, because even after all those years there's still nothing like it.

>Nier Replicant is a fabulous remaster of a lauded but messy cult classic, improving it without giving up on its essential strangeness.

-------------

**[PSX Brasil](https://opencritic.com/outlet/514/psx-brasil)** - [Leonardo Cidreira](https://opencritic.com/critic/4080/leonardo-cidreira) - *Portuguese* - [90 / 100](https://psxbrasil.com.br/nier-replicant-ver-1-22474487139/nier-replicant-ver-1-22474487139-review/)

>NieR Replicant ver.1.22474487139… is the best starting point to discover one of the greatest franchises ever made by Square Enix in recent times. The title is much more than a simple remaster, correcting the main flaws that its original version had, while raising it to a level close to that of its successor. It is gratifying to know that such a title has finally been able to see the light of day again after spending years stuck on a platform.

-------------

**[PlayStation Universe](https://opencritic.com/outlet/39/playstation-universe)** - [Garri Bagdasarov](https://opencritic.com/critic/840/garri-bagdasarov) - [9 / 10](https://www.psu.com/reviews/nier-replicant-review-ps4/)

>The NieR franchise has easily become one of my favorites. After NieR Automata, my need to replay the original NieR grew and grew, and thankfully, Square Enix has answered my prayers for an updated version of the original title. NieR: Replicant tells a fantastic story that's carried by great writing and a soundtrack that stops you in your tracks to listen to its incredible melodies. The only thing that holds Replicant back from true greatness is its old-school take on fetch quests and the horribly constant backtracking.

-------------

**[RPG Site](https://opencritic.com/outlet/322/rpg-site)** - [9 / 10](http://www.rpgsite.net/review/11022-nier-replicant-ver-1-22474487139-review)

>Vastly enhanced visuals, a slicker battle system, new content, better performance, and other smart additions makes this the definitive version of what once was a diamond in the rough.

-------------

**[Screen Rant](https://opencritic.com/outlet/664/screen-rant)** - [Cody Gravelle](https://opencritic.com/critic/1828/cody-gravelle) - [4.5 / 5 stars](https://screenrant.com/nier-replicant-remake-game-review/)

>NieR Replicant ver.1.22474487139... isn't just a comprehensive remake that makes some startling updates - it's also a proof of concept for the series moving forward. The story holds up, the refined combat is engaging, and its charm and melancholy both resonate with a player long after they've put the controller down. In revisiting NieR's past, it becomes clear just how bright its future is. NieR Replicant ver.1.22474487139... is something worth playing in 2021 and beyond, and a one-of-a-kind JRPG that continues to challenge convention even a decade after it first began to do so.

**[Siliconera](https://opencritic.com/outlet/793/siliconera)** - [Jenni Lada](https://opencritic.com/critic/342/jenni-lada) - [9 / 10](https://www.siliconera.com/review-nier-replicant-remains-haunting-and-thought-provoking/)

>NieR Replicant ver.1.22474487139 is a more approachable version of an emotional and thought-provoking RPG. This is a game people might not have known what to do with years ago. Now, following the success of NieR: Automata, it’s presented with additional accessibility options, better looking and smoother gameplay, and additional content that gently builds on what was already there.

-------------

**[Twinfinite](https://opencritic.com/outlet/21/twinfinite)** - [Zhiqing Wan](https://opencritic.com/critic/80/zhiqing-wan) - [4.5 / 5](https://twinfinite.net/2021/04/nier-replicant-ver-1-22474487139-review/)

>Playing through NieR Replicant felt like a fever dream at times, in the same way that NieR: Automata’s reveal at the very first E3 I’d attended felt like a fever dream. It’s a testament to how special NieR is for it to have endured solely in the hearts and minds of its most dedicated fans for a decade, only to explode into a phenomenon that has kept the video game community talking and debating over it long after the credits have rolled. The rough edges of the original release are still present in NieR Replicant, but it’s clear that this game and the series as a whole will no longer just be another faded memory.

>Nier Replicant is a must-play for anyone who loved “Automata,” a game some praise as one of the finest ever created.

>A generic, sub-par action RPG that is neither generic, sub-par or even an action RPG. NieR Replicant ver.1.22474487139... is a unique game that constantly plays with our expectations, deconstructing a genre while constructing a subversive narrative. It may not be perfect, but it's still a must have.

>There aren't many games like NieR Replicant, and I'm not just talking about in the modern era, but since 2010 as a whole. Whatever power that be helped Yoko Taro become world-famous, to the point where he can keep making these weird masterpieces, in any format: thank you.

**[Fextralife](https://opencritic.com/outlet/501/fextralife)** - Fexelea - [8.5 / 10](https://fextralife.com/nier-replicant-review-impressions-is-the-nier-remaster-worth-it-should-you-buy-nier-replicant-v-1-22/)

>Nier Replicant is an endearing, comfortably predictable story that turns out to be nothing of the sort. Relaxing afternoons fishing or cultivating and action-packed dungeons coexist to deliver an ingeniously conceived narrative that will stay with you for years to come, as you try and fail to stop humming the fantastic soundtrack.

-------------

**[Press Start](https://opencritic.com/outlet/491/press-start)** - [James Mitchell](https://opencritic.com/critic/3659/james-mitchell) - [8.5 / 10](https://press-start.com.au/reviews/playstation4-reviews/2021/04/22/nier-replicant-ver-1-22474487139-review-an-endearing-bittersweet-update/)

>NieR Replicant ver.1.22474487139... is a fantastic celebration of a game that, even after a decade, feels unmatched in how it tells its incredibly unique story. The visual overhaul is excellent, and the combat better than ever. However, some archaic quest design acts as a deft reminder that this is a game from ten years ago. Without a doubt, though, this is the best way to experience NieR where it all began.

**[RPG Fan](https://opencritic.com/outlet/37/rpg-fan)** - [Alana Hagues](https://opencritic.com/critic/159/alana-hagues) - [85 / 100](https://www.rpgfan.com/review/nier-replicant-ver-1-22474487139/)

>Regardless of my feelings on the final changes, or at my annoyances at the reptetitions, few games touch my soul as deeply as this series does. NieR Replicant ver.1.22474487139… is still an experience that will always stick with me, whether I think my hard work has been rewarded or not. The original 2010 release came with many caveats, and Replicant has softened many while bringing some of its own, but this is a game that makes me think and feel more than most others. It’s tedious, mindless, and even frustrating at times, but this rerelease makes a peculiar, melancholy and beautiful game much easier to recommend.

>It's probably not going to win over haters of the original, but for returning fans or those who jumped in at Automata this is a fantastic update to a cult classic game that also happens to bring with it some very exciting new surprises.

>Nier Replicant Ver.1.22474487139... is the best way to play a genuinely amazing game. The flaws of the original version have been smoothed out some more, and while it still struggles with tedium and grind, the bright spots stand out. Even if you're not traditionally into JRPGs, I can recommend Nier because its unique story and tremendous voicework make it stand out as an extremely well-told tale. Be prepared to curse the designer who decided that one of the most common items you need to upgrade weapons has what feels like a 1% drop rate.

>NieR Replicant ver.1.22474487139… is the perfect way for fans of Automata to experience the original and for newcomers to engage with the franchise. With updated combat and visuals, Replicant can proudly sit amongst greats in the genre, however, the hypersexualized representation of Kainé remains and deters from an incredible experience.

>NieR Replicant just modernizes a rather controversial work, and improves it to the right point. Emotionally destabilizing on the narrative front, Yoko Taro's action RPG, reinterpreted on a playful level by the Toylogic team, maintains its essence halfway between genius and madness, without the needle always positioning in the right medium between the two extremes.

>Gamers weren't quite ready for Yoko Taro's NieR back in 2010, but now the now cult classic is getting another chance in the way it was originally intended. On top of additional content and bonuses not found in the original, NieR Replicant ver.1.22474487139... features a beautifully melancholy narrative that is equal parts gut-wrenching and heartfelt, all of which is very worth experiencing.

**[Digital Chumps](https://opencritic.com/outlet/96/digital-chumps)** - [Eric Layman](https://opencritic.com/critic/782/eric-layman) - [8 / 10](http://digitalchumps.com/nier-replicant-ver-1-22474487139/)

>Nier presented as an action role-playing game. Nier was actually a controlled demolition of genre conventions driven by a taste for subversion and a desire to explore emotional boundaries between mild sorrow and hysterical despair. Replicant ver. 1.22474487139… keeps Nier intact with distinct improvements to its operation and accessibility. It remains an eccentric, effective, and occasionally inhospitable member of its medium.

>NieR Replicant ver.1.22474487129… remakes an under-appreciated action RPG for a new era of consoles and players, giving us another look into the beautifully bizarre mind of creator Yoko Taro. Replicant isn't the most impressive remake on a technical or visual level, but it's received some very welcome upgrades, such as an improved combat system. More importantly, the thing that didn't need fixing wasn't broken: the original's captivating storyline and cast of characters. Everything in that regard is still here as it should be, just told through the eyes of the initially intended protagonist, and with a few pieces of originally cut content restored.

**[Game Rant](https://opencritic.com/outlet/60/game-rant)** - [Pam K. Ferdinand](https://opencritic.com/critic/8192/pam-k-ferdinand) - [4 / 5 stars](https://gamerant.com/nier-replicant-review/)

>NieR Replicant overall is a successful remaster, with a bit of spit and polish improving many facets of the original game, but with some of the negatives unfortunately carrying over as well. The end result is an action RPG that will keep most players entertained for many hours, as the story, combat, and characters outweigh the boredom of Replicant’s sometimes repetitive gameplay.

>Adressed to both new players and longtime fans, NieR Replicant succeds in transcending the NieR experience, thanks to its enhanced (yet imperfect) visuals, its full re-recorded soundtrack and voice-acting and its new gameplay mechanics to make it feel more like NieR Automata. For sure, the addition of new scenes, such as the Mermaid episode and an all-new ending, represent a powerful argument to those who are already familiar with the original game.

>While the backtracking remains, it feels much less painful this time around thanks to it being part of a game with smooth performance that’s ultimately much more fun to actually play. The game is considerably improved as a result, and much of what made the original quietly special can now shine far more brightly. It might not be perfect, but within this slightly flawed framework beats the heart of an absolute masterpiece. Those who fell in love with Nier through Automata should go into this with a clear expectation that this is not that game – but if they do, they’ll find much to love.

>Despite being a great game and a worthwhile remake, NieR Replicant ver.1.22 is not for everyone. Some of the dated design elements are frustrating and needlessly time consuming. The story, while incredible, is locked away behind multiple playthroughs and endings, with its true value being entirely subjective depending on how much time you’re willing to invest. However, none of this is news to fans of NieR: Automata. Put simply, if you’ve been waiting for a deeper, darker dive into the world of NieR, ver.1.22 will not disappoint.

For reference, the original Nier has a metascore of 68

I can't help but wonder how much of the difference is based on legitimate improvement, and how much is due to Nier having gained a lot of recognition over the past decade and reviewers knowing what to expect
    Also, what constitutes a “good” game evolves like anything else.  Unconventional games that emphasize story/music/art tend to do better now than before from what I can remember.

My past review experience is based off magazines though because I’m old.  Back then focus seemed to be on graphical output, technical cohesiveness and core gameplay.  Could just be misremembering though.
        To be fair, the original Nier's gameplay wasn't exactly anything to write home about. If the characters, setting, aesthetics and story don't hook you I could totally understand why you'd think it was a mediocre game.

But yeah I think a lot more critics nowadays are willing to tolerate average/bad gameplay if the rest of the game is unique and interesting, so games like Nier will do better. Probably on account of the average reviewer being much older than when I was a teen and having become jaded to gameplay on account of having played all of the millions of technically competent but extremely similar made-by-committee sequel and copycat games that the industry churns out regularly. Which is probably also why critics nowadays tend push indie games a lot more too since those are more likely to take big risks and be weird and different.
            As someone who played it to completion on release, the gameplay was kinda awful.

Big gameplay flaws :

* The combat was very weak when compared with contemporaries like Kingdom Hearts.

* The side quests consisted almost entirely of mundane kill x of a specific monster fetch quests

* The weapon upgrade system amounted to grinding one room in one dungeon for tens of hours for one rare drop that was needed in everything.

* Fishing.

Sure there was story, but even at the time of playing, the weight of the poor gameplay was palpable and caused the experience to be a total slog.

That doesn't even speak to the technical issues that resulted in huge spikes of lag and frame drops everywhere. 

I don't care how compelling the story was; the game deserved a 7/10. And honestly, you were drip fed so little of it at any given time that it was hard to piece it all together against the gameplay. I ended up just reading summaries on gamefaqs after beating it all to have it one place.
                I played the game to completion on release as well and I fully agree with this. I have found memories of the story but I remember kinda hating the janky combat. I also remember discovering a spear-dash into dodge-roll combo that basically broke the entire combat system because it let you do hit-and-run attacks while being almost untouchable so you didn't need to bother learning enemy attack patterns anymore.

Honestly my very first concern when I heard about the remaster was to pray that they fix the combat system because as much as love Nier, I'm not willing to replay it again unless the gameplay is improved.
                    it feels much better. magic and melee is woven together way more smoothly, and although the combos don't have anything on automata ( makes sense. these aren't combat androids ) it's definitely an enjoyable experience this time.
        Yeah that game came out at the peak of games fitting x model for success. That was just after even nintendo caved into making an edgier zelda because people wanted grim and dirty.
            Twilight princess came out nearly 6 years before iirc
                Plot twist: They are talking about >!The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds that launched in 2013!<

>!I'm joking!<

>!Unless...!<
            Nah TP was supposed to be another OOT-like(a somber, at times quite dark game whos original release even included bleeding enemies during combat & some cutscenes) and it was a direct reaction to the spaceworld Zelda demo showcasing the potential of the GC. The demo was done in OOT/MM like artstyle and people expected a return to form for the Zelda franchise after MM(3.3 million sales) failed to sell as much as OOT(7.6m). 

Later on Nintendo revealed the next zelda with a childrens cartoon aesthetic the opposite of OOTs at times dark and more realistic style. The fan reaction... was not pretty. WW(4.4m) didn't sell so much either, TP became the next game in development and it garnered massive hype throughout its dev cycle. TP ended selling so much it broke franchise records selling 8.8 million units.
        That would depend on the magazine I think. :)

Definitely from the mid 2000s PC gamer was more into the overall experience. Back into the 90s Amiga magazines I read would do the "graphics, sound, gameplay" scores and add them up.
        Nier wasn't a good game though by standards then and now. Amazing story and soundtrack but environments were extremely dull and boring and combat was lame. As long as they fixed those two things, which it seems like they have, the game should be great.
    It's really interesting, actually -- even on this version of Nier, the book on it is definitely "it gets really good, but it takes about 10 hours to get there". 

So Nier was a new IP that seemed pretty generic and is not interesting for the first 10 hours -- I think a lot of critics gave up on it way before it turned into something different (and that's totally justifiable, to be clear, 10 hours is long-ass time). But now Yoko Taro is known as a genius auteur, Nier is a beloved franchise, the cult following for this game is well-known, and people are willing to give it the benefit of the doubt.
        Hardly seems fair to judge any story game with out finishing it. I can do it cuz I'm just some fucking guy and if it doesn't hold my attention so that's fine, but if it's your job to review a game, seems you should have to finish at least the story before you can give a fair assessment. Imagine writing a review on a movie you didn't finish.
            I think there's a big difference between a movie that lasts between 90 and 180 minutes, and a game that could take 30-40 hours, especially when you've gotta get a review out on deadline. There's a certain point, I think for me it's about 5 hours into a game like this, where it's totally reasonable to bail if you're not hooked.
                well sure, but thats if you're not a reviewer.   


im sorry but I could never trust a reviewer that bails on a 40 hour game 5 hours in unless its just absolutely terrible or not fun.   


if you try to review a 40 hour game that you've only played 5 hours of, you shouldnt be reviewing it at all. maybe it can be part of a smaller segment where you give your two cents, but a full review? I dont know if thats fair. 

but I do think there there are exceptions. for example girlfriend reviews recently did a video on persona 5. that game can run any where from 60 to 200 hours of game play depending on how much you try to do. Persona 5 is, I think for day one reviewers anyway, a hard game to review for because its so damn long. That said, they did mention that they were going to finish the game and if I recall correctly provide a follow up. But they did get a good way through it, I even saw them playing on twitch at a part of the game that takes like any where from 20 to 60 hours to get to so they definitely saw more than the first 5% of the game.   


I just think for a FULL proper review of any given game, you gotta see the story out to the end at least.
                    If a game isnt fun in the first 5 hours it's a bad game, sorry.  Why would I want to slog through 5 or 10 hours of boredom for it to maybe get good when there are fun games I can play instead?

Reviewers should finish games but for the opposite reason, to identify if games just use cheap tricks to make you think its good in the demo but with no satisfying story or endgame
            For me, if the game isnt good within the first 30 minutes then I'm not going to keep playing. Time is a valuable resource to me, and I like to think most people feel the same.
                I don't really think that's a viable rule to follow for most RPGs tbh
                    I think it matters for any game. It's not about everything being great but if there's nothing that hooks you in the first 30-60 minutes why keep wasting your time?

It can be anything, graphics, combat, dialogues, voice acting, anything really but there has to be something compelling and this will be different for each person and each game.
                    Most games rely on a loop of actions. If I'm not enjoying the loop then it's probably just not for me.
    I think a lot of people in western games journalism just weren't used to JRPGs at the time, however original nier and drakengard 3 ran like absolute garbage and still do on the PS3 so I'm not the least bit surprised by parts of the scores those games got. Drakengard 3 was so bad that it would get down to 10fps during fights.
        Drakengards' performance was bad but I'm pretty the original Nier ran pretty well especially for a ps3/xbox 360 title.
            Having just replayed both nier and drakengard 3 on ps3, holy mother of god D3’s performance was genuinely baffling. I have no idea how it got released in that state. Nier was great :)
                Honestly, Saying the frame rate was trash was being generous

And this is coming from someone who lord the game and the franchise.
    It seems like a lot of the reviewers this time around had played and were fans of the original. I imagine that's a significant factor for the jump in score.

I wonder how this game would be received by players new to the series.
    When NieR was released on PS3 there was someone from Kotaku (i guess) who wasted like 3 hours trying to fish something outside the tutorial area... so he obviously didn't got anything and couldn't progress in the game but he never noticed he was doing everything wrong.

Yeah people really hated NieR back in the day, a lot of journalists not even finished it 2 times.
        It was Joystiq, and he did eventually notice he was doing something wrong. He never did a full review for it I don't think
    The story, characters, and music where already fantastic in the first one, it was mostly letdown by its gameplay/combat.

The combat was functional but not very fluid, fun, or balanced. Some weapons/skills where so underwhelming there was never a time to use them, and some skills/weapons so strong there was no point to use anything else (spears where so overpowered that Im fairly certain I was able to use a spear + dmg amps to take out the last boss in less than 10 hits)

There are also a lot of parts that are text based they require you to answer some questions based off details given in the text story. It's a neat idea but executed in a way that makes its very long-winded and boring, especially if you get any of the questions wrong (and you probably will) because it makes you sit through way too much of the text story stuff again only to realize the details change every time so you fuck up and have to it again! Basically a not very fun part of the game.

From what I've come to understand this gsme had the guys from platinum that headed the combat for N:A overseeing the combat for this game so I have high hopes.
Considering what OG Nier is, these scores are pretty fucking great. Please remember that this game is very old and probably outdated from a design and gameplay standpoint, but my fucking god are the characters, story/themes/philosophy and music worth pushing through for. The game really has a special place in my heart and I can’t wait to check it out again.
    This thread is hilarious because it's the opposite of the original's reception. Reviews are giving it acclaim while the users here are all complaining about it (for issues they haven't even actually seen yet).
        People are complaining about the technical issues. It's indeed strange because they haven't even tried it yet, but those are valid concerns.
            I'm playing on PS5 I haven't had any issues so far, just my personal experience
                Complaints come from PC gamers, which have been already been burned by Automata's horrible PC port.
        Really fond of the commenters bemoaning that it's locked to 60fps on PC, and also that it has problems over 60fps. 

It has a couple of clear issues but inconveniences more than game breakers and focusing on them isn't missing the forest for the trees as much as it's missing the entire pacific northwest for a few ugly leaves.
            I can’t imagine skipping a classic because you can’t play it above 60fps.
                Hell, I highly doubt the original was playing at 60fps to begin with. So, it's definitely not a good reason to pan this game.
                    You're right. Gestalt was 30 FPS max (besides emulation hacks), and it sometimes went into the teens: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmYONPPAag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmYONPPAag)
                    The original was not a PC game, came out during the 360/PS3 era where games had awful sub 30fps framerate and was a low budget title made by a subpar dev team(ignoring Taro's talent).

This is a PC game following up an incredibly successful game that sold 5.5million units being released in the year of flying cars: 2021. Not at all comparable.
                A game locked at 30fps might give me pause, but anything over 60fps is more of a luxury for most games. Over 120hz I genuinely can't tell the difference most of the time.
                    It might be a case of getting used to something, I have been playing pc games on 4K for the past 2 years, and playing a game at 1080p feels like I'm playing on 144p. I never played on 144hz but from what I hear it's hard to go back. (Not that I think its a reason to ignore a classic game like this, hell, bloodborne is locked to 30 and I will forever recommend it)
                        I agree, but I think there's probably a point with framerate where you hit diminishing returns. Like, from 30-60 is a world of difference, but 60-144 is felt less in games with without twitchy camera movements, and 144-240hz even less so. For me, I don't see any difference over 144hz even in shooters.
                            The difference between 60 to 144 is like 38fps vs 60fps (frame time wise); still a very noticeable difference and hard to go back to. Not sure about 240hz+ though
                        I guess it depends on the person, but I have no problem playing games even at 30 fps after experiencing 144 Hz. Over time I realized that cosistent frame times are far more important to me than frame rate (ideally I'd want both of course). Also, VRR is a godsend, especially on displays over 60 Hz.
                        I think the 144hz argument is only true for some game types. Yeah playing something that requires fast reaction times like a FPS will definitely feel worse if you're under 144FPS. But I can can go back to skyrim and not really feel any worse with its locked framerate.
                Right? Who are these people?
                    PC gamers.
                    I see melodramatic comments like that on here all the time that get pretty good reception. I just chalk it up to the extremists of an already fringe community. Most normal people really don't give a shit.
            You're right, 60FPS is fine. What isn't fine is that animations are tied to the framerate. This has been a big no-no in games for over the past decade. If your framerate goes above or below 60fps weird things can start to happen.

>There are no options for VSync and framerate limit, which is important because running it above 60fps speeds Replicant’s animations up, making boss fights much harder than they should be. A regular stutter, which seems to be linked to a controller issue on Steam, is equally annoying – mine would periodically disconnect during these stutters...

PC gamers should probably wait for Digital Foundry to release an analysis on the game.
                Tying gameplay to framerate is dubious programming but not unheard of.  But tying gameplay to framerate without limiting the framerate is just trolling.
                Breath of the wild did it

It's 2021, that shit isn't really acceptable anymore.
                I could not give less of a shit about a framerate so long as it runs at 60fps, but the point I'm making is if it's locked to 60 then you can't exactly complain that it functions incorrectly above 60. That's the same criticism twice.
                Dude it runs at 60 fps. I have everything I would need to run it at 144hz 1440p but I don't care.

These are technical hurdled imposed by time, you gotta know when things are big enough to justify the work to rework the engine and events
                    Agreed. It's wild to think that many games were stuck at 30fps on the generation of consoles that *just* ended, and people are already treating 120fps as mandatory instead of a luxury.
                        no better way to get developers to raise their standards of output quickly, though.
                [deleted]
                    Yeah really. If I can go up over 60 that's awesome I love extra high fps, but 60 solid is the goal and 144 is brownie points.

                Imagine skipping a masterpiece because 60fps isn't enough. Lmfao
        People who comment on online gaming forums care more about technical minutiae than the audience most reviewers are writing for.
    I actually revisited the original about a year ago in anticipation for this (I knew that a "remaster" would never be just that with a Yoko Taro game), and I think the original holds up surprisingly well. 

I'm kind of confused as to the cold reception it got at release. The combat is just *fine* sure, but the game is still completely engaging even ten years later.
        Honestly, the original Nier holds up pretty well and is a lot more engaging than other JRPGs of the time and even the endless brown/grey shooters that everyone loved back then. The combat isn't the best but it's fun enough for what it is.
        Interesting. I haven’t played it in a long, long time but IMO the “just fine” combat was worth putting up with for what I got in return. It really is THAT good and I think from a narrative standpoint it is a bit better than Automata as well.
            Absolutely. The combat was serviceable, and that's all it needed to be.

I think I still like Automata more overall, but that's completely from a taste/personal preference. I don't think I could make any kind of argument as to Automata being an objective improvement but rather just an expansion of some of the ideas in the original.

Both are absolutely some of my favorite games ever.
                When I saw that Platinum was attached to Automata I screamed an internal “fuck yes” because Nier already had the Yoko Taro and Okabe secret sauce. Pair that with Platinum’s flair and you get one of my favorite games ever too, in nearly every aspect.
                    Did you guys like the combat in Automata? I was really excited about Platinum being involved and I loved the game overall, but I found the combat sub par. I hate how the optimal way to play is to hold in the shoot button at all times.
                        Again, I think it's serviceable. I think it's better than the original Nier's combat, but it's nothing all that special. I appreciate that it's non-intrusive. I know platinum excels at intricate combat systems but I appreciate that Nier Automata isn't quite as in-depth as a Bayonetta or what have you.
                        I'm not far in, but that's probably my one thing. I don't like having to hold down the trigger *forever*.
                            >I'm not far in,

Get off this subreddit before you see spoilers!
                                No >:D
                            It gets old really fast and it's even worse on higher difficulties when you take insane dmg at close range and thus has to rely more on range attacks to kill spongey enemies. Automata is one of those games were I kind of regret not going for the easy mode.
                                As someone who just finished route A on hard, I almost never had to use my ranged attack, like at all (except the ship part of course).

EDIT: Oh, I think the only time I used ranged attack is against the centipede in the castle.
                                    I think they're saying the held the trigger down the entire time they were in combat while using the melee attacks. 

If I remember right, there's an option to just toggle it on and off. Either that or the attack was so weak I just didn't bother with it anyway. I know I wasn't holding the trigger down the entire time.
                        It’s definitely Platinum’s weaker ones, but it’s still pretty slick, flashy and badass which I love.
                        I would go so far to say the combat is substanceless. The game has great aesthetics, themes and character performances, but the one thing holding back is... its gameplay
                            Definitely disagree with you there. IMO the big pitfall of automatas combat is just that it rewards certain mashable strategies, but if you really learn the intricacies of the combat it’s absolutely not completely lacking of substance. You can be pretty creative when you know what to do, [like this guy does.](https://youtu.be/d3Eh0jbddmk)

I understand your point of view though because instead of all that flashy stuff you *could* just spam evade and sprinting heavy attack. But i believe they just wanted to make the game very easily accessible. If you want to take the combat to the next level, you can.
                        I started enjoying it quite a bit after replaying the game on Very Hard. Learning how to control groups and isolate enemies with extended juggles by using animation cancels made the experience much more satisfying, as did actually learning boss attack patterns. It's not the best combat system out there, but it's more than just serviceable in my opinion. 

Although, the game certainly is at fault if dying in one hit is the only way it can make me learn attack patterns. Healing is way too forgiving and powerful enemies should have some level scaling.
                        it had good animation and sound design (putting it above most other action RPGs) but you could basically mash your way through everything and dodging was easy. It was also really easy to break the RPG side to trivialize things further. It's no DMC or Bayonetta but still fun.
                        Automata's combat was pretty shallow especially for Platinum but I didn't really tire of it until a couple of playthroughs in. I honestly can't remember if I played it on hard or very hard but a lot of things (especially in the early game) practically one-shot me so combat became a kind of hokey cokey dance of dipping in and out, spinning around (i.e. spamming dodge). Once I got a feel for it I actually really enjoyed it, had its own rhythm and its beautifully animated. I liked it enough to go out of my way to make it look as flashy as possible (sliding about on sand was a particular favourite of mine), which helped make up for the lack of depth to a point.
                        The level scaling and instant healing are both busted as well. The former makes it a complete slog to kill anything significantly higher level than you, while the latter makes anything that isn't a one hit kill almost meaningless.

Combat looks cool and the characters are fun to control, but the actual combat design is awful.
            >  It really is THAT good and I think from a narrative standpoint it is a bit better than Automata as well.

Both the narrative and the characters were better than Automata
                Debatable. 

Automata had better VA performances, and emotions.

But to a character like Kainé, 9S/2B/A2 don't hold a candle.

Overall, Automata is superior though.
                    > 
> Automata had better VA performances, and emotions.

VA performance don't really impact on whether a character is better or not though, that's just production stuff. And Kaine VA > all of Automata.

>Overall, Automata is superior though.

It was the more well rounded game. It had better pacing and combat, while still having a solid story. But Gestalt will always be way more of a memorable game for me, in big part because Automata's android characters just didn't hit the same way as emil/kaine/weiss
        i think the biggest issue is that it was a glaringly low budget game. ultimately automata was just far easier to market to a wider audience with platinum and the 2B ass memes, all gestalt/replicant had was "wait this game has godlike music and writing and the gameplay blows" as its tag line
            Also, Platinum Games made Automata. It's not even necessary to watch a gameplay to know that a game made by them will have a great frenetic, fast paced, fun combat. Everyone expects that. Can't say the same about Cavia, who *was* known for its... anime games?
        As someone who got about 10 hours in then bounced off when it first came out, I think the original Nier wasn't *bad*, but it lacked a clear identity and that can be frustrating for players early on. It tried to weave a mystery but felt more like an erratic, messy narrative. And the combat was... Serviceable, but boring. And the weird, Yoko Taro flair of layered endings, multiple playthroughs to get the full story and bizarre canonization of Drakengard.

My guess is by riding the wave of Nier Automata's success by iterating and improving on much of the above, some better tech and reliable recognition, it made sense to revisit this and modernize it.
        > I'm kind of confused as to the cold reception it got at release.

NieR was released at a time when Japan's influence in the west was at an all time low and every western dev was aping Gears Of War. If your game wasn't brown, grey, or starred a dude who shot a gun and looked like they ate steroids for breakfast, then it was probably going to be largely ignored.
            The original NieR was largely brown and its starring dude did look like he eats steroids for breakfast.
                Yeah, Papa NieR only exists because Yoko Taro was trying to appeal to the west. Fat lot of good that did. If we're being honest though, the main "problem" with NieR was that it was a Japanese game that didn't fit in into the traditional mold.
                    And video game reviewers are on average kind of shit at reviewing narratives.
                    I still prefer Papa Nier compared to Brother Nier just on the basis that I like the narrative of a father saving their child more than a sibling saving them ... Both are still great however
            Nier was all of that, minus the gun. It was ignored because it was grindy as fuck and the gameplay was ass.
                I don’t think you can blame the Ending C and D grind since most reviewers probably didn’t even get there.
        The game looked like crap, ran like crap and had tonnes of grind and repetition. Combine that with the shallow combat, lack of QoL features, other jank like the dumb party AI, and even some messy story bits, I think the reception was pretty well justified back then.
        I was just playing it this morning. I couldn't wait and had to scratch my itch for it, haha. I feel like it holds up fine.

Honestly the worst part of the game for me can be the fishing mini game, but moreso that it's just a bit enraging at times.
        I think its a combination of factors, mostly that mainstream gaming media wasn't quite at the point then where it was ready to judge the appeal of games on something other than marketing bullet points (i.e. that a game could be valuable as an aesthetic or emotional experience instead of just as a "game") and there weren't many platforms yet for fans to talk up its good points. Its also important to remember that games like Nier weren't actually all that uncommon in the 6th and early 7th gen. "Weird , mid market Japanese games" came out pretty regularly, and while they rarely became mainstream hits they were still common enough that you could find them lining the shelves of just about any game store. Weird arty games like Ico and Shadow of the Collossus were huge, and even Drakengard 1 was a modest hit for the time. And Nier was competing in the same space as games like Demon's Souls, it was a niche but a reasonable crowded one where you could be a little spoiled for choice. So a game just having a unique aesthetic might not be enough to carry it. But now that they've become less common, and interest/acceptance has risen in the mainstream thanks to break out hits like Yakuza 0, Nier: Automata, and Dark Souls, its gotten easier to look back and reevaluate these things for what they were rather than for how they didn't conform with the expectations of the time.
    OG Nier is probably the most hilariously wrong metacritic score of a game ever, a whole bunch of reviewers that had no idea what they were reviewing
        I wouldn't say that. It's a game that has flawed or mediocre graphics and gameplay, but great writing and music. I can't fault reviewers for scoring it based off of all of it's attributes rather than just it's best ones. It's not a game for everyone
        It does give it a certain mystique tho lol. I’m not sure if this is due to Automata’s success but it has a certain aura and reputation about it. I really, really hope this remaster allows more peeps to give it a shot.
            The best part of the remake to me is definitely that all the people that missed it originally, because it fell under the radar, get to experience one of the most memorable games I can think of
        IDK I think I thought about it long enough that the remake was announced and sounds like a better iteration of the game. The original was often called "ultra interesting" but a chore to play.
            Those people never played Drakengard
                I'm watching and longplay and what the fuck and why on earth.

It does look like mediocre gameplay with an interesting plot but it's just so weird.
                    Its a really bizarre game that the secret ending leads into Nier. Its set up like a Dynasty Warriors game but the entire game, the music, the graphics, the gameplay, the story are all designed to make you paranoid and agitated.
                        I can see that regarding eveyrthing but the gameplay. It just looks mindless as hell, like a Dynasty Warriors game without the spectacular. Kinda like the first Onechambara.

Then it all goes to what in the fuck land in the final third. I'm kinda glad for these games longplays are a thing. Due to a lack of hardware I can't really play these games right now (man I'd love if Sony gave a shit about BC for these kind of games. Also Valkyrie Profile), but at least I can see and somehow know what are they about.

Seriously that ending with the **Spoiler:** >!flying demonic babies!<. I saw that years ago somehow and thought it was a nightmare I had, and even when I started looking into Taro's games I had an idea this was it and could not figure out how it ended up like that.
                            "It just looks mindless as hell" - yeah that sounds pretty unnerving and agitating since you dont need to think and all you hear is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NocSlsBJHxY&ab_channel=Durandana
                                [deleted]
        Or maybe it had some problems not everyone is willing to overlook.
            I'm not saying its a perfect game, it had plenty of flaws. But if you compare to every other game that has a 68 meta score....

It got done poorly mostly because it was a JRPG coming out at that time, and because it wasn't big budget
        I think reviewers definitely knew what they were playing then.  
  
I got OG Nier at release. It already looked worse than other games already on the market and already felt like it was made in a budget. The voice acting was just okay and only really serviceable if you were into anime voice actors. The gameplay was alright, but wasn’t exactly exceptional either. The only real highlight was the fact that it incorporated bullet hell aspects into it, which was very new for the time. And the story, atleast intro-wise, was just kind of standard, but there were better looking and more polished action RPGs already at the time. The game was also somewhat buggy.  
  
The game was totally reviewed fairly back when it released. The story, for how good it actually ends up being, doesn’t make up for every other aspect of the game just being “okay”, especially considering how much work you have to put in to really get to the meat of the story.
            > The voice acting was just okay

Sorry, but you're crazy.
                That I think it’s just okay? Should I have thought it was better? Because I have my OG copy of the game and the voice acting was just alright. Not bad by any means, but wasn’t exactly top tier by any means either.  
  
At the time, it was just standard anime voice actors. If that floats your boat, that’s totally cool. But it wasn’t top tier
                    Nah the voice acting is some of the best of the time.
                        Considering all the other games of 2010, I think that’s definitely up for debate and likely in regards to whether you prefer dub anime voice actors or not, but I am by no means crazy for finding the voice acting to just be okay. “Okay” isn’t bad.
                    You're fine to have your opinions. But by and large the voice acting in OG Nier is considered to be phenomenal and its voice cast is stacked as fuck by today's standards. Like you really gonna say a game with Jameson Price and Laura Bailey as the main cast has bad voice acting?

Again you're welcome to have your opinion, but recognize that a majority of people disagree with your opinion and future success of the voice actors points to them being talented. Not saying you're wrong, just saying most people would think you're wrong.
                        Considering how poorly the first game sold and reviewed, I don’t think it’s crazy find the voice acting as just okay. Again, I never said it was bad. Not once. “Okay” does not equal “Bad”. It just means “Okay”. Those two people don’t suddenly make the voice acting anymore fantastic. Again, they’re just anime voice actors and they aren’t bad by any means, but aren’t exactly setting the world on fire with their performances in OG Nier either. Never said they weren’t talented. Never said they were bad. Just that the overall voice acting of the game is just okay and somewhat par the course for a lot of JRPGs of the time.  
  
Please, understand that I’m not saying the voice acting is bad by any means. I’m just saying it wasn’t top tier either and I think that is a completely fair assessment given the overall quality of the game.  
  
There is such an odd defensiveness of OG Nier as if it can’t be stated that the game has flaws. I love OG Nier. I personally find it fantastic, but there is a very clear reason why it wasn’t widely viewed as a big deal at launch. And that’s okay
                            Out of interest, what games would you consider to have top-tier voice acting, particularly from the same period? I thought Nier's was pretty great (Kaine and Weiss at least), but I haven't played a ton of games.
                            No. Didn't you hear them? You need to have their opinion because it's a popular one!!! Everyone would disagree! etc
                            > Again, they’re just anime voice actors

Anime voice actors is just a weird term to use, because tons of voice actors do tons of things. You're differentiating anime voice actors from...what? Voice actors who only do animated shows and movies? If you look at most big name voice actors in games, they probably have some anime on their backlog. In fact, a ton probably do. 

Take The Last of Us, which is probably the furthest you could get from anime, plenty of the main voice actors there have done plenty of anime. Troy Baker voices Joel but did anime for like 10 years before he even got the part. Laura Bailey voices Abby in TLoU2 and has also done a ton of anime, in addition to being Kaine. But they didn't just do anime, they were doing a wide variety of other video games too: western games and Japanese games both. 

That's not to say you can't have your opinion or that it's invalid, I just don't think "anime voice actors" is even really all that useful a distinction. Almost all working video game VAs, including the ones in Nier, do a mix of anime, American cartoons, Western video games, and Japanese video games.
            > And the story, atleast intro-wise, was just kind of standard,

If you don't finish a game, you shouldn't review it

/edit suggesting Professional paid critics should finish a game before reviewing it is controversial? The fuck is this subs sometimes?
                If you state you didn't finish the game and exactly why I think a review is totally fine. You might miss out on part of what makes a game something special but then the reader and either write it off altogether or seek out another review to decide if it's worth it. 

Especially with a game like Nier - it finishes stronger than it starts narratively but vastly worse gameplay-wise, and if nothing up front in the first ten or so hours catches someone's interest enough to put up with its worse aspects, it's unlikely anything in the last ten hours will make up for that.
                    > If you state you didn't finish the game and exactly why

Isn't Nier the game where the [reviewer gave up after the game told him to catch a fish and didn't explain that no, you needed the fish from over THERE](https://www.engadget.com/2010-05-03-nier-review-fail.html).
                        yup yup. the part my guy Juice there leaves out is that the instructions for how to fish in the game are also incorrect, so a reviewer would just have to fuck around until it worked before they even get around to figuring out there's somewhere else to fish.
                    And it's not like a game can't do it better while delivering the same themes. Nier Automata proves that decisively. Enjoyable gaming experience right from the get-go, and narratively engaging at the start. Of course, it's really in ending C-E where it reaches its amazing apex, but even without those endings, it would still be a quality experience.
                Even if you finish the whole game, it's valid to critique how long the game takes to get good. Most people aren't going to go through hours of mediocre gameplay and basic story just to get to the good part.
                I disagree. Not wanting to completely finish a game is a valid reaction, after all.

Let's take it to the logical extreme: imagine how warped the reviews would be if BotW only got reviewed by people who gathered all 900 Korok seeds. It would basically filter out everyone except the most hardcore players who just so happened to be most compatible with that particular game!

Games *can* be experienced without achieving some arbitrary measure of completeness. Reviews should reflect that basic truth. If a reviewer couldn't stomach finishing a game, *you bet* that I would want to know that. I want a review that actually represents the reviewer's individual experience with the game, not a fruitless attempt at assigning something as nebulous as artistic value or intrinsic worth.
                I don't think it applies with this game.

I love NieR:A. One of my favorite games of all time.

That said. I wouldn't recommend it to most people. The beginning of the game drags way too long and is the worst aspect of the game IMO.

The game doesn't really pick up story-wise till after you 'beat the game' once.

I dropped the game once before getting to the parts I really liked.

Guess my point is I think its totally valid for someone to burn out on one of these games before completing it especially because they quite literally demand you to replay the game over again before really seeing significant progress in the story.
                Right, but the game doesn’t start to truly standout until it’s latter half. Even for as good as the endings and really last half of the story is, the intro is still pretty standard and wasn’t exactly enticing a wide range of people at the time. You have to play the first half to get to the fantastic last half story, but if it’s a bit of a slog to get there, that’s going to affect the overall opinion of the game. The endings of the game, for as great as they are, didn’t make up for the rest of the game that was already rather lackluster for its time.  
  
And I say this as someone who loves original Nier
                Why? I don't have to finish a bad meal to know I'm not going to enjoy it. If a movie isn't grabbing me an hour in I'm not gonna lose sleep over giving it 1 star on Letterboxd. Why should I have to play every single minute of a video game before being able to leave a review?
                    You shouldn't ever have to play through the entire game for a review, just as long as you let the reader know you didn't finish it in the article. That way, they can make an informed decision about whether the review is useful or not.
                I wonder how many reviewers even knew how to get the true ending. All weapons is somewhat of a chore, even if NG+ runs are quick.
                    Getting all the weapons isnt too bad and it isnt like Drakengard where you have to max them all out
                        >Getting all the weapons isnt too bad 

That's quite a understatement, heh. You could miss out on some of them in first half of game without a guide and after halfway point, you were pretty much softlocked unless you chose to restart over all way from the beginning.
                            There are no missable weapons in Nier. You can get every single weapon at the very end of the game.
                                Weird, I recalled just giving up after reading some guide mentioning I missed some quests with weapon rewards.
                                    Nope, there is only 1 weapon that you can "miss" by not doing a sidequest and that weapon can be bought at a shop for a period of time after the "timeskip". So if you miss it on your first playthrough, when you start at the midway point during your second you can go buy it.
        Or maybe the story only propped up the game so much for them? There's no need to be all high-and-mighty just because you liked the game a lot.
        I thought Automata was boring, ugly and extremely overrated. Would I enjoy Replicant? I'm assuming no.
    Yea, hearing about OG Nier after playing automata, I’m really surprised by these scores. It was a day one buy for me just based on the themes but I’m really excited that the game itself has been improved upon.
    Absolutely, a lot of remakes seem to suffer in reviews for simply being a good remake of an outdated game - I half expected this would have been one of them and I likely still would have been happy. I'm glad to see it doing better in reviews than I anticipated.
    Soooo, is this the first game, and Automata is the second? I've never played them but I'm kinda curious. Wondering where to jump in.
        The connecting story is intentionally surreal and hard to follow, you won't really *get* how the two are connected until you play both (in addition to digesting some amount of side-content). There's over 9000 years between the events of Nier and Automata, so they're hardly directly sequels!

All of that's to say that you can play either first without hurting the "intended" experience. Anything that *could* be spoiled is only sort of *knowingly hinted at* in such a way that's only obvious to the player in hindsight, after playing both games.
        Yeah, they’re not super duper linked but playing this followed by Automata seems like a good idea.
        Well technically Nier is a sequel to Drakengard's (kind of) joke ending which is, of course, a sequel to Drakengard 3. And there's some short stories dotted around, at least one stage play, maybe some manga, whatever Yoko Taro posts on twitter, not Drakengard 2... Honestly, I really think that Automata was probably the first to catch on quite like this because it's the first one that's not actively annoying to play. But by the sounds of it they've sorted out the gameplay issues in Replicant so you grab either that or Automata for a great standalone experience. 

They're not super closely linked and the time gap between the two is... a while, but there are a few links in Automata that gave me all the feels to discover, and I can definitely see a lot of Automata players having the same experience of discovery with the new Replicant

TL;DR: Both great, both work on their own and as a pair. Be shallow; if you want cute androids then go Automata first, if you want to be [yelled at by a glorious trash monster every time you boot up the game](https://youtu.be/OvyvQfn30uE) then Replicant's your best bet, they'll fuck you up either way
            Nier is just a spin-off to drakengard.
            > if you want to be yelled at by a glorious trash monster every time you boot up the game

Turns out I would very much like to get yelled at by a glorious trash monster, huh.
        It's the 4th!

Drakengard > Drakengard 1 > Drakengard 3 (released after Nier) > Nier > Automata

(I might have the canonical order of the drakengard games backwards too, it gets messy.)

They have interconnecting themes and some recurring characters, but you don't need to play them in order. While specific endings are canonical and lead on to the next game, it's more a shared universe sort of deal.

(Drakengard 2 was developed by another studio without Taro, and while it follows on from Drakengard 1, it otherwise exists outside the canon and also *isn't very good.*)
        Both games spoil elements of each other's plots. I would recommend playing OG Nier first because I think the plot revelations hit a little bit harder going that way, but either way you're gonna get spoiled on something from the other game so just go with whichever you want.
            And Replicant is "OG Nier" just updated?
                The more accurate/complicated answer is that there were two versions of OG NieR in Japan - NieR Replicant (PS3) and NieR Gestalt (Xbox 360).

NieR Replicant had a young protagonist (brother trying to save his sister); NieR Gestalt had an older protagonist (father trying to save his daughter). Other than that, they're the same game.

But Replicant didn't get localized in the West, only Gestalt did, and they dropped the subtitle since there was only one version - so the North American game "NieR" is NieR Gestalt, with the "father" protagonist (and it got released on PS3 as well in the West, unlike in Japan).

This game is an updated remaster of NieR Replicant, the version with the "brother" protagonist that we never got in the West.
    I tried to get into the original Xbox 360 game but the bland gameplay and environments was just unbearable for me. However I did fall in love with the [Soundtrack](https://youtu.be/Gm-X7KBBacM). Definitely looking forward to playing an improved version ☺️
        Shadowlord from Nier is probably in my top 5 video game tracks of all time.
        Unfortunately the new arrangements are overall almost all downgrades from the originals. The one thing that didn't need any updating....
    The gameplay has been reworked tho
    I thought the gameplay and design of Automata were pretty underwhelming, but the game was still great because all the other elements were fantastic (pretty much everything you mentioned). This makes me *really* look forward to playing Replicant.
    I don't think time diminishes good design and gameplay in general. Nier is an interesting case, because it had offbeat design choices from the beginning. But there are games decades old that have better design than some modern ones.
        No I completely agree. I didn’t mean it as new games have better design than old games, it’s just that Nier has some pretty damn weird design choices.
This is pretty much what I expected *and* was hoping for; this is a 'version upgrade' that brushes up a 10 year old game and makes it more palatable for a modern audience without making any drastic changes to the original formula. What that means in practise is that *yes* it does have some outdated quest design and fairly easy combat, but those aspects detract less from the main draw of the game than in the original.

The main draw? The story, the characters, and the music.

As all the reviews have stated, the story is something worth experiencing, and with the less aggravating gameplay, **now** is the best time to do so. Nier Replicant, the original and by extension this version upgrade, is my favourite game of all time. It has it's flaws, but more than makes up for those in telling a special story that can only be told in this format. It gave birth to what would eventually be a surge in respect for Yoko Taro's work and is generally considered one of his best games. He's a weird guy, but he's a phenomenally creative entity.

With news that more Nier content is in development, now is absolutely the best time to experience the emotion-driven story telling that this man delivers, not to mention the almost genre-bending design decisions he implements in his titles.

**Side note:** PC version seems to have some issues, though apparently not quite as bad as Automata did. Pro-tip? Lock your framerate via the Nvidia control panel or equivalent and try to keep your controller from disconnecting during gameplay cause that can cause some minor issues.

        I only played the last of us for the first time in september but I only remembered the ridiculous amount of bugs I encountered playing it when I read this comment lol. That ending was so good it went from "a pretty cool game" to one of my all time favourites.
            [deleted]
                I was on PS4 and I had loads of little bugs here and there, the Kind that makes you laugh rather than impacting it badly though. My personal favourite was my weapon getting stuck spinning around all over the place like Joel is a magician.
                    Sorry but I don’t think this is common
        > Spec Ops, 

Re:railroading, I’d say that illustrates a key weakness of that game: its very topical commentary (c. 2012) and only having one chance to pull you in otherwise it fails.
    Your experience with this games is making me excited about the experience. Nier: Automata is my all-time favorite game. Nothing has come close for me. Let's hope the original kicks it's ass. I'm buying this once I get off work.
        The gameplay and design should be worse but as someone who played Nier 1 before Automata I feel the story and music was much better on the original than the sequel(this is actually a common fan sentiment). That said this remake changes the music a lot so it might not have the same impact as the original.
    > **Side note:** PC version seems to have some issues

Here we go again... I pre-ordered NieR: Automata on STEAM, this new one I will buy only in some sale.

I still have my copy from the PS3 which I did 100% so yeah... no rush here. Maybe I buy it after 4 years when they patch the problems the game had on release.

If they like to treat their customers outside Japan like this the only thing I can do is just wish the worst to Square-Enix.
        You wish the worst because the PC port is lacking?
            And will probably never be fixed if Automata is anything to go by.
                They're working on a patch for Automata right now. Unless you're aware of that and implying it'll never come out.
                    Wow already? That was fast. Can't believe it only took them 4 years.
                    Took them 4 years, you wanna wait 4 years for all their PC ports to potentially get fixed? 

While they're at it, maybe they should upgrade from ps2/3 era graphics fidelity.
                        You realize this is a remaster of a ps3 game from 2010 right? Maybe you should look up a graphics comparison video if you think it’s ps3 era.
            If they dont want us to play their game is their problem, i pass buying games that devs didn't gave a single fuck to make the pc version at least working...
            Not OP, but you’ll find that sentiment to be common among the pc gaming community.

There’s already more good games coming out than most people have time to play, no point spending that time playing games or supporting devs that have poor pc ports. Japanese developers need to get with the times and recognize that it’s a growing platform with millions of people and start caring more about bringing proper ports to the platform
            I feel like this is par for the course for online gaming discourse, I understand people are disappointed and unhappy with SE but people need to have some perspective.
        Sure buy it 4 years later
Huh even some of the worst reviews are still like "this is a must play classic that just has some problems.
    After Automata's success made Yoko Taro games more mainstream, it's not a surprise this one is being reviewed in a more "alternative" way, considering the weirdness the game is built on.
        Can't wait for a modern remake of Drakengard.

That level of weirdness is going to melt people's brains. The music alone is on another level.

Zero will violate you, both from and back, all in 60 FPS.
                    I want to find that interview where Taro jokingly mentions the difficult frame was to make you feel bad about what was happening because how awful your character was. How hype is the idea that the game itself doesn’t want you to commit game crimes so it’s actively trying to prevent you from going forward. It’s a joke and not reality, but such a funny idea. My favorite are games that when making a choice ask you if you are sure, but then a second window appears right after to go “but, are you really sure?”.
    [deleted]
        Even Cyberpunk had the odd naysayer. I suspect the reviews are all aware of how the original game had some really boring systems so there's not much else to say there.
    If you go back and read Automata’s reviews, a lot of them read like 10/10s and have an 8 next to them. Maybe a tax for AA visuals? The OST and art design more than makes up for the technical side in my book.
    [deleted]
        To be fair automata was not much better I love that game but stopped doing side stuff pretty quickly.
            Ah the stories as a whole were pretty good in side-quests for Automata, but I can't argue that they were designed as basic fetch quests and some seemed interested in just wasting your time. 


IIRC side-quests in the first Nier were significantly worse. There are a few standout ones like the Lighthouse sidequest but by and large its just really one-note fetch quests with little story impact. I guess I just find the idea of androids/robots trying to learn what it means to be human and exploring that through side-quests to be a more natural and interesting conceit than just "me hungry get mutton thx".
            At this point I am sure they are just parodies of shitty sidequest in other jrpgs.
            Uhhh, there was a lot of quality content in the side quests that added a lot to the story. Off the top of my head, I remember one that involved Yorha's executioner models by going deeper into their back stories, and another that went into a whole philosophical concept. How are these bad side quests exactly?
        Holy shit, I played this game wayyyy back in the PS3 days, and your comment is the first time I heard I was supposed to play it three times. I missed out on so much shit wtf ahahahah no wonder I was always left a bit confused by the story
            Automata is the same way if you ever play that, don't stop at ending A!
        I mean, that was the original game. Great story, shit gameplay. Also the requirements to get the full story are a miserable grind. It was a game you'd honestly probably get more enjoyment out of watching a lets play maybe than actually playing through it. I was kind of hoping this version might fix some of these issues in some way, but I guess not?

    Interestingly enough, these two reviews have a mutually exclusive take about Framerate - PCGames is saying it appears to cap at 60 and has no options. PCGamesN says the game breaks down if it is above 60FPS.

One of these two has to have a mistake in there and considering we are talking about PCGamesN which generally has, at best, a shoddy quality I am not sure I care much for their take.

Sucks though that PC again gets the short end...

Edit: Also interesting that the controller comes up with both but very differently as well. Its like someone only got bulletpoints as data and had to write a review resulting in a different interpretation.
        My assumption is that it caps at the monitor refresh rate and the PC Gamer reviewer had a 60Hz monitor and didn't realise this was the case
            My assumption is similar, although what I'm betting is that the one reviewer that had capped FPS played the game on fullscreen borderless (which caps the game's FPS to the monitor/desktop refresh rate without needing V-Sync), while the other played on "true" fullscreen.
        Digital Foundry will probably cover it.
            I adore Nier but I'll wait for their video (or someone's in-depth performance analysis) before I pick it up. Don't want to risk buying it only to find out that it has massive frame drops, frame pacing issues, or worse.
                Yep, Automata is one of my fav games (played on release on PS4) but playing it recently on steam it was a buggy mess, just refunded before the two hours, the game pass version is okay but I still had a crash and some drops below 60 unfortunately
                Automata was unplayable to me until I installed FAR.  FAR fixed everything but a really minor frame pacing issue in the open game world.  Played perfect in the actual "zones" though.
        >Sucks though that PC again gets the short end...

I, for one, am shocked that a company that never bothered to patch their previous game in spite of crippling technical issues and only announced they'd work on a patch when preorders for their new game were open would release said new game with crippling technical issues.
    The main issue seem to be controller disconnecting after a stutter. Other issues are no options for vsync and framerate options from what I've read from both reviews. 

I hope Square atleast fixes this one.
        > The main issue seem to be controller disconnecting after a stutter.

There was a report saying they accidentally disconnected their controller during a session and that caused the stutter.

I think I've heard some are experiencing random controller disconnects, and apparently this might be AMD CPU issue. My USB headset will cut out every once in a while and apparently this is a common issue (though none of my controllers ever have). Supposedly getting a BIOS update fixes this.
    What a surprise... Let me guess, they also won't fix the issues on this one just like Automata.
        They'll fix them you just have to wait for the next nier game.
        [removed]
            I dunno if 'they're fixing automata 4 years after it's initial release, with no patches in between' should be held up as an example that they will fix the game in a timely manner. Especially when the automata patch isn't even out yet. 


From these reviews it seems like Replicant might be less broken (I don't recall whether automata reviews emphasized how shoddy the pc port was), but that doesn't mean it'll get any more post launch attention.
            Don’t get your hopes up. They’ll most likely only put the Game Pass version on Steam, that barely fixes anything and call it a day.

If they can’t make a new release work, how could we expect them to fix the old one in any way.
                This, and any fix will break the current FAR mod which will require a mod update.
                Two different dev teams.   Maybe Square will let them patch Replicant where they wouldn't let Platinum, since Plat announced they were working on patches before their involvement ended.
    That makes it 2 out of 2 times Nier on PC was flawed.

For fuck's sake, SquEnix.
    Ugh, *come on*. Why do devs *still* tie shit to framerate for PC games? Just had to deal with this crap in Nioh 2 not too long ago as well, which had the exact same problem (bosses acting like they were on crack when the framerate was too high).

EDIT: Okay, I wasn't aware that this is a remaster, not a remake. Still sucks, but it's a bit more understandable. Still hope they fix it instead of leaving it to rot for years like Automata.
        You guys do realize that this is a remaster not a full blown remake which means its running mostly on year 2010 code of a low budget game that was never intended to be on anything other than consoles made by a now defunct company that probably had no idea that a decade from now the series will blow up and fans would want the OG game on modern platforms.

These kinds of issues were bound to happen.
            While this is fair in this particular case, a lot of other games still do this and it appears to be a side effect of "make game as fast as possible" not "make game with best practices and future proofing in mind".
        it's sadly not uncommon for remasters, but it still really sucks
        It’s easier to program, and swat bugs when the timing is fixed at the frame rate.
            It's not "easier to program".

Multipling your value by the frametime is the easiest shit there is, competent devs have been doing it since the late 90s.

There is NO excuse for not doing this nowadays (or 10 years ago for that matter).
            I get that, but I don't get why you would do that for PC when the framerate is going to be so variable. I don't imagine it makes no sense in every scenario, but for stuff like animation speed I just don't understand why you would do that for such a variable environment.
                Precisely because it is so variable. Removing the need to account for framerate differences removes a lot of variance you would need to account for. Especially when you design a game primarily for consoles, when porting to PC it simplifies a lot to just force the PC to act like a console.
    I'll be buying the game on console then, I was waiting to find out if they was going to release another broken pc port.
        Just wait for actual pc port reviews.  Both the reviews that went into any detail whatsoever had completely different experiences that were contradictory.
        I just bought it on Series S. Was planning on getting PC but somewhat expected it was gonna get the stepchild treatment.

Absolutely can't wait to play it though.
            I think it's extremely unlikely that the PC version is worse than the Series S version (on a sufficiently fast PC).
                Any plans on patching this game for them? :D
                You're absolutely right. Decided to put the console to use though, feel like I'll enjoy the game more on the couch and take my time with it. Can't wait.
            Since you're on Xbox, you can [change your system's region to play the game right now.](https://old.reddit.com/r/nier/comments/mvhtvw/to_all_xbox_owners_changing_the_consoles_region/)
                You the man dog. Just made my night look a lot better.
I'm *really* looking forward to picking this one up. As much as I love NieR: Automata from a thematic and presentation perspective, the original NieR is on my "S tier" of video game narratives, alongside Ghost Trick and Xenogears. The original still holds up well for me personally, but I'm looking forward to see what little content was added and the minor tweaks to the mechanics.

And I'm really excited that more people will get a chance to go back and visit this title for the first time, following Automata's monumental success. I think that for people who played Automata first, the OG game won't have quite the same impact, as the very existence and premise of Automata spoils the biggest twist(s) of the original game (i.e., that its actually >!science fiction!< ). But it should still be a gripping story to go through, with one of the greatest soundtracks in gaming
    Another Ghost Trick enjoyer. There's dozens of us!
        There are two types of people: those that love Ghost Trick and those who have never heard of it. Unfortunately most people fall into the latter camp
            I felt like I knew basically all games that people geniunely feel are their "favourites", its cool to find one I absolutely do not fucking know about.
                Ghost Trick is also available on iOS if I remember correctly. I think that might be how I played it actually... wild, awesome story.
    Ghost Trick hell yeah
    i think you just sold a copy of this game by putting in the same sentence as Xenogears.  Im replaying xeno right now and i was just thinking how much more engaging the story is than most videogames these days.  Having never played the original Nier i guess i gotta check this out.
    The first dungeon >!is clearly a dilapidated modern building!< so they weren’t *that* secretive about the game being >!post-post-apocalypse!<
Well those scores are a bit better than what the original got. Its almost strange going back to look at reviews of the original nier and how little discussion of any of the genuinely unique things that would eventually make the series famous there is.
    To be fair, there were alot of "3rd Person Melee Action Adventure" games back then. So I don't find it too odd that Nier kinda fell to the wayside at the time.
    I'd be surprised if any reviewers got ending b, c or d
    That's because there are a *ton* of gameplay issues with the original Nier. Even criticizing reviewers for not getting the extra endings for replaying parts of the game falls flat because the game does almost nothing to make those replays tolerable.

I made my way through the original alongside my (at the time) roommate, and even knowing about the additional endings we both agreed that we couldn't stand to replay the game after getting the first ending because it simply wasn't enjoyable to play.
Did not imagine that 10 years later the spin off sequel of a weird ass possible ending to a semi obscure PS2 game would finally get wide acclaim. It’s a bit obtuse at times, but the story is rewarding in the end (remember to do multiple playthroughs) especially if you played Automata. Watching these play though has also reminded me just how wonderful the soundtrack is. 

If you played Automata and haven’t played this you’ll love it. Part of me hopes there’s something that will nod to Geshalt since I did like Papa Nier’s story (even if his art design was awful), but if not it’s still a great story.

    ACG stated that load times are like ~~~10s~~ 5-11s and that it’s locked @ 60fps

Edit: Double checked his video and fixed the times up. Still a tad long
        PS4 physical copy vs PS5 digital download doesn't make any difference in performance right?
            Nope!  Shouldn’t be any difference since PS4 physical should be backwards compatible on the PS5 - and there wasn’t any version tailored for the PS5 so it doesn’t matter for now
                Great news! I love collecting physical games and WalMart usually has games for about $10 cheaper + compatible with PS5. Win-win-win
Just beat the first boss. So far, the music is just as stellar as Nier Automata's. I listened to Devola's song in the plaza for too damn long. It's so good.
    The same composer did some NieR music that’s specific to the FF14 raid series. Even if you don’t intend to play, I recommend giving it a listen. 

Here’s [one of the tracks](https://youtu.be/jVAgd9dbYIs).
Hopefully this sells enough for a Drakengard 3 remaster next. I want to play all the games I should have played on the PS3.
    if you want to play Drakengard 3, play it on emulator with the 60 FPS mod, its alot better than the 1-10FPS you get on console in combat
    I want to play that game so badly. Fingers crossed.
A game that was once a 5 - 6 / 10 from reviewers and only accepted as a cult classic, is now a 9 / 10 mainstream must play phenomenon.

What a time, I'm glad one of my favourite games of all time is seeing such success.
    Shows how much community influences reviewers. If the first one would not have been a cult classic, this would've stayed at 5/10.

Reviewers are writing numbers that people **want** to see and occasionally substract a point or two. Best case in point: Cyberbug: San Andreas. Buggy, shallow, and not cyberpunk to the point that even the author of Neuromancer got on Twitter to mention that it seems like 70's retrofuturism and not cyberpunk.
        >If the first one would not have been a cult classic, this would've stayed at 5/10.

If the first one didn't become a cult classic this one wouldn't have even existed.
        [removed]
        I agree. I love the NieR franchise, but unless this remake makes some *significant* changes or improvements to the game I really don't see how it deserves a rating higher than 6/10.

(Spoilers) >!Seeing as you have to play through the game three times. It relies too heavily on a single plot twist. The majority of the background, lore, and exposition isn't even included in the actual game but in side novels. Ending D makes no sense other than for feels. The true ending E isn't even included in the game.!< Some of these issues could very well be fixed in the remake, but I don't have high hopes. Sure the original is a cult classic, but I feel it's gonna get scrutinized *heavily* when exposed to a wider audience - especially when people claim it's far better than Automata.
            The achievement list shows that >!Ending E is in the game. Don't know if it's the same one, but regardless there is an Ending E!<
                Oh hell yea, that's great to hear. >!Tbf I wouldn't mind even if it was just an adaptation of the one from the novels. I don't really know the nitty gritty of it besides a TL;DR, and it's been like 4 years since I even read *that*.!<
        Yea, that's apparently obvious, most reviews are just pandering for views to their respective audience and never really step on any toes.
    Shows how bullshit game reviewers are. They dont say what they think, they say what you want to hear.
        I don't know. Part of appreciating art is meeting it halfway. When something is new and strange it can be hard to find the right frame to enjoy it. A more polished mainstream sequel can act as sort of a guide to teach you to notice and appreciate the qualities that were in its predecessor.

Plenty of people now love MGS2 who hated it upon release, myself included. These days we're more accepting of meta-narratives and intentional user-hostile design in 2021 than we were in 2001. Things that used to be alienating now seen as clever and subversive.

My opinion change doesn't mean I was previously disingenuous, it just means that years of life experience and art experience allow me a different perspective than my younger self.
        That would make sense if it were literally the same game, but they went back and fixed a lot of the issues reviewers at the time brought up.
            Quite a lot of  the reviews clearly disliked it for feeling dosjointed and a mishmash of multiple genres, then that became a staple and beloved feature with Automata.

True, the combat wasn't as great, and it was uglier, but I wouldn't say that makes it a 5/10, the characters were much more intriguing than Automatas IMO. It still had a stellar voice cast, an incredible story, great characters, a 10/10 soundtrack, deep and emotional sidestories, one of the most conpelling endings in videogame history, and all in all... the combat wasn't bad, just not a highlight and the progression was actually somewhat addicting... it was never such a poor game.

To be fair, I haven't seen all of the changes, but if a change of combat and a small graphical facelift brings a 5/10 to a 9 - 9.5 / 10, I think there's a lot more at play than simply fixing old issues.
        game reviews are opinions and opinions can and sometimes should change over time.
        I don't think so - playing a remastered cult classic is going to mean you give it a lot more leeway to impress you. A random game comes out that takes 10 hours to get to the good bit and has its own problems besides that? I think anyone would be less lenient with it. Like how if food smells good, it can make you hungrier and more inclined to enjoy it.
How long to beat? Multiple chapters?

    Multiple play throughs to see everything but after route A you restart at the halfway point for B and then after seeing all the new content there you can just skip cutscenes and just plow through in 3-4 hours each for C and D. Thats just going by the original game. I'm sure there will be some added stuff in this one though. And like others have said it's about 35-40 hours long.
        oh damn, so this game unfolds like Automata, multiple chapters for the full experience, that's awesome, I loved that about Automata.
            Yep, all the storytelling techniques people loved in Automata originated in this game.
    There are multiple endings like Automata and the B Route is absolutely a mandatory part of the experience.
For PC Players, you may see reports of stuttering when using the controller, this is not an issue with the game it's an issue with Steam Input. Right-Click the game > Properties > Controller > Disable steam input.

That will stop the stuttering and it should still allow the controller to work in game.
Honestly, even if the PC port turns out to be dogshit, it won't change the fact I'm going to be thrilled to be playing a remastered version of one of my favourite games.
    im torn since the game is way cheaper on pc for me, and my ps4 its gathering dust until i can get a ps5, hope the bugs are not that big so i can finish the game in peace
        Isn't it a full priced game on steam? does it cost more on consoles?
            oh i dont know about other countries, but im from argentina, and steam regionalizes prices so it isnt as expensive as a playstation game that you have to pay in dollas plus taxes and shit, sucks but thats the way it is
                Damn, Poland is still $60 on Steam so I've decided to wait for a sale :/
            isthereanydeal.com
        It appears to be 4k/60 on PSPro/PS5 (and the OneX/Series X). Console will probably be the best place unless some fixes PC with a patch or mod.
            Can't wait for Kaldaien to give us the DRM infused mod we really deserve.
            Really, someone else said it was 900p on series x.
    Square Enix: what if it's worse than dogshit?
        The square root of 1.5 dogshits?
Damn, they managed to make a 68 MC "Mixed" game into a 83 MC "Positive" game. I can't think of any other remaster/ remake of a game that has accomplished that before.
    Well not too many games with MC scores in the 60s get remakes. This definitely not possible without the success of Automata.
        
>Well not too many games with MC scores in the 60s get remakes

Which is stupid. The best games to remake would be ones that did something interesting and unique but didn't manage to pull off the execution as well as they should/could have.

For the record, yes I'm aware the reason is money.
    The original metacritic score was dogshit to begin with. Such a misreviewed title
        Nier Gestalt is one of my absolute favourite games, so subjectively I completely agree with you. But if I look at the game from a slightly more objective perspective...I have to say it just wasn't a great game. Clunky as hell, gameplay was very rough, side-quests tedious, etc. So I get low scores for the original, even though I would personally rate it much higher.
            If games are works of art, an S-Tier story, characters and OST should elevate a C-tier game to a B score.
        No it wasn't.
    Hype does that sometimes
I wasn't a massive fan of Automata, it was fine and I did the main endings ( A-E ) but is this a good game to play through as well?
    If you didn't like Automata, this won't change your mind on the series I feel. Like Kojima, Yoko Taro does some Yoko Taro-ass games.
        Don't get me wrong I liked Automata, but I felt it was overhyped and heralded as this "Best Game Ever" whereas I played it, enjoyed it and had fun, but not the best game I've ever played, a solid 7 or 8 /10
            Automata is easily my 2nd favourite game of all time, only behind FFX
                ffx fans !
                    FFX is also one of my two favorite games of all time. Love that game.
It is so surreal to see critical opinion on this game flip now that Automata has come out to huge success. I remember when the original came out and it got blasted with 6s, 4s, etc. 

Now that public opinion has shifted, critical has went up with it.
    I think the main knock against the original is that the gameplay was really not good. I think an ~82 OpenCritic score is roughly appropriate for a game with improved but often tedious gameplay, but with an amazing story/music/characters etc.
I only ever played Nier: Automata, I know this is a remake/remaster of a previous game so I did go into this with that in mind...  It does feel like a 2010 game.  I have to say I'm not really too captivated so far.  I've played about 6 hours at the moment.  I'm still going to keep playing... maybe it will get better judging from all the great reviews...  Anybody else feel the same way?  Does it truly get better?

The grandma thing felt like really weird writing.
    I 100% agree. I loved Automata, it was possibly one of my favourite games of all time but I cannot get into this even after playing for over 10 hours so far. The difference between Replicant and Automata is night and day, it feels and looks extremely dated which I could probably forgive if the gameplay also wasn't lacking.

I'll probably keep playing, but I somewhat regret paying full price for it.
        I loved automata (my first exposure to nier) enough to get all 26 endings and Emil pillow merch. About 20 hours into Replicant and I’m considering just watching the cutscenes on YouTube. This game feels terrible to play. I’ve even decided to hold off on side quests in the second half because I can get them on a later play through but even just doing the story is such a chore.
    God damn I feel the exact same.  I just finished the first route and even the big reveals they try to do there are like "yeah thanks I figured that out like 8 hours ago thanks".  And I keep hearing people say what a "great character" kaine is but she's literally just "swears a lot, but is nice sometimes".

I KNOW it's going to get more interesting with the subsequent playthroughs, but God damn I'm not sure I'll be able to fully forgive what a slog this has been so far. If you haven't already, I highly recommend putting it on easy and just being through it...
    
Unfortunately I felt the same. Love automata, struggled with this game. 

I was really struggling around this mark as well. It picks up at around 8/10 hours in but then just gets really boring again once you realise you're just doing the same stuff again. 

The story and plot and characters where so engaging in Automata and I was so excited when people said they were even better in Replicant. I could have forgiven the combat for an amazing tale but damn. I honestly couldn't care less by the end. I connected to no one which just made it all worse. 

My first set of credits rolled around and I thought... Do I really want to play this again? (knowing it was another replay and not a different story or even perspective) annnnnnd I thought no. I might be missing out but I'd rather just read what happens on the toilet and forget about it straight after than put myself through it again in all honesty.
        Oh the perspective changes all right. You do you, but I'd go so far to say if you didn't play the B route you didn't experience Nier.
            I'm okay with that, I completely, completely cknowledge I didn't finish it in the slightest. It was just the line in the sand for me, and considering I didn't do all the side quests in the first half I also knew I wouldn't be able to get all the endings. 

Playing to "find out more" Also just wasn't an incentive because I didn't really care about the characters or the story. I did end up reading the developments and watching clips though. :) 

I think for me a great, well told story is like the amazing tasty cherry on a great game but the game play needs to come first. If I'm not enjoying the game I'll just play another game and listen to a lore/story telling video on it on YouTube. 

I have now just started a replay of Auto from the start though and seeing Emil and certain details like the dessert robotsmasks that I had forgot about are awesome. So some genuine joy came out of it.
                > I have now just started a replay of Auto from the start though and seeing Emil and certain details like the dessert robotsmasks that I had forgot about are awesome. So some genuine joy came out of it.

Glad it retroactively worked out for you in that sense in enhanced your Nier: A experience. You may appreciate this trove of information at this stage: >![The Ark](https://theark.wiki/w/Welcome).!<
  
 
> and considering I didn't do all the side quests in the first half I also knew I wouldn't be able to get all the endings. 

Just a heads up in case you come back one day you don't need to do all the side quests, just collect all the weapons (though some Part 2 SQs do give weapons). Any weapons missed in Part 1 can be bought in Part 2 from the shops, so you also don't need to sweat that aspect of it.
        Damn.  I feel bamboozled honestly, I really put in trust with people saying that it gets better after 10 hours, really the only reason I didn't return it after I played for 2 hours... Now it's too late.
            Yeah... It's such a shame. I get that it's a remake/remaster of an old game but in that case slapping the £50 price tag on it was a bold move.
    I’m in the same boat. I absolutely loved everything about automata and it’s probably one of my top 10 favorite video games. I’m over halfway through this game and it honestly feels like a choir 90% of the time. I’m really trying to enjoy it but everything about it feels dated. The story is decent but it doesn’t seem to be enough. Maybe I’ll change my mind once I finish but so far I’m really not impressed.
I see one thing about pc port being bad. Why is this thread doomsaying it off what this one review says? RPG site review said the pc port was fine.
    People got burned extremely badly by Automata. One of the best games of its generation and it was hard crashing my PC.
    Yeah the issues are really minor lol, they're minor annoyances at the most. They overlooked 144hz+ monitors and owners (such as myself) will have to cap it manually and theres stuttering caused by controller disconnects but thats basically it lol. If that was all Automata had wrong with it I'd have played it on PC for framerate stability and resolution.  


I guess people are still pissed over Automatas recent drama.

Im out of the loop, whats with the name? ahahah ver  **1.22474487139**
    It’s the square root of 1.5, which is what the creator thinks of this game.  In between a remaster and a remake. (Which is still an insane Kingdom hearts level name but... at least it makes somewhat sense lmfao).
        oh my god hahahahaha !!! Thank you both for the info
            He's also quoted as stating:

*"Incidentally, the big string of numbers on the end of the title was just something I stuck on randomly, so I wouldn’t think too hard about it if I was you."*

Gotta love the honesty.
            Hes doing it as a joke/parody of Kingdom Hearts' shitty numbering system. If youve never played a YokoTaro game, they are all full of gags and parodies of other shit
Don't know yet if I should pick this up on PC or not, but good thing Steam gives out refunds because it can be hit or miss.
This is a really minor thing but it always bugs the hell out of me when people call remakes a remaster. This is pretty clearly a remake, in the same way that Yakuza Kiwami is obviously a remake.
    The reason the name has 1.2247448 (square root of 1.5) at the end is Taro believes it is halfway between remake and remaster so its both at the same time.
        well that makes more sense than the various Kingdom hearts names, so that's nice at least.
            Imo it still falls in the Kingdom Hearts territory. It is needlessly complicated and when showed off on a website makes it seem like the listing is broken if you don't already know the game's name
                pretty sure Yoko Taro did that on purpose. he's an edgy guy and it's funny. most people will call it the Nier Replicant remake/remaster and it won't be confusing
                    Nier Replicant alone sorta works too since the old one is called Gestalt, and to casual fans this is just a brand new prequel anyway.

                    We're talking about game titles here, not the story
            No it doesn't? The KH names make much more sense than that.
            what? every single KH name makes sense and has a meaning. this narrative about KH being overly complicated is so overblown at this point
                Look I'll be the first to defend the plot of KH as not being all that complicated, but names like " Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover", "Kingdom Hearts 0.2: Birth by Sleep – A Fragmentary Passage", and "Kingdom Hearts Unchained χ/Kingdom Hearts Union χ[Cross]/Kingdom Hearts Union χ Dark Road" are just nonsense.
        Not according to [this interview](https://square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/nier-replicant-dev-message?utm_campaign=devmessage_photo_SQEXSOCIAL). Seems like he considers it a "version upgrade". Then he goes on to say

>Incidentally, the big string of numbers on the end of the title was just something I stuck on randomly, so I wouldn’t think too hard about it if I was you.
    What? This is absolutely NOT a remake. The creator specifically refused to call it one because its not. Its still very clearly running on mostly old code thats why the PC port has all these weird issues.
        All the assets have been remade. They aren't simply using upscaled textures like a remaster would. Maybe the underlying code is the same, but that's pretty standard for remakes so it keeps the same feel.
            Yeah, pretty sure i heard the combat was redone from scratch too.
        That's like saying Demon's Souls PS5 isn't a remake because it too uses old code.
        I love Yoko Taro and his works, but he is very much an eccentric artist. One should try to take comments from such artists regarding their own work with a grain of salt and not as gospel.
            Yes Taro is eccentric but that doesnt mean he lies about shit. He is always very open on development problems that his team run into and budget constraints that he has had to work with. 

Him saying this not a real remake is very much a serious comment made to make sure than fan expectations are grounded. 

Him calling it ver1.22474487139... is him being eccentric and having fun with it.

They are two different aspects of the same person.
                I'm not saying he's lying. I'm saying his perceptions of his own work can be skewed, and that can affect the way he assesses them. In particular, I've picked up on some higher levels of humility and self-doubt when he discusses his work, which could absolutely affect this exact scenario.
                    I get what you are trying to say. Taro loves self depreciating. But the "this is not a full remake" is not one of those. It's not just Taro the entire team stated that as a very matter of fact thing. 

As someone who 100% OG NieR, I can tell you this is the same game. They have very clearly shown the part they remade like the core combat and what parts they left exactly the same. Like the environments and stuff. Most of the environment assets arent even remade just upscaled and further polished and the team confirmed that. If people are going in expecting a brand new experience, this is not it. It's gonna feel slightly dated because at its core it is still a low budget ps3 jrpg.
        he also tried to claim that Nier's name isn't Nier so are we really taking his word on this kind of thing?
    Taro literally says it's not a remake nor remaster, but a 'Version Upgrade'.
    This is not a remake at all, this is still built on top of the original game including several flaws
        Remake:

* Uses completely brand new assets
* Runs on a completely different, modernized engine that may be similar to the original game engine
* Was built from a brand new codebase
* Retains the original story/concept
* Examples: MGS1 on Gamecube, Demon Souls, RE1/2/3, Link's Awakening, Gen 1-4 Pokemon remakes, FF3/4 on DS

Remaster:

* Uses updated assets (graphical and/or audio)
* Runs on the same engine with possible QOL fixes
* Shares much of the same exact code as the original
* Has the exact same story
* In some cases, a console "remaster" is not much different than a PC game running at higher graphics settings
* Examples: Pretty much every PS3 game released on PS4

Or a TL;DR: If the game looks like someone just turned up their graphics settings, it's a remaster. This game is clearly a remaster.
The comments here are so critical, yet the reviews are so positive. I can hear loud and clear the PC community are frustrated, and rightfully so. Nier Automata was such a great game, i loved it in and out. I'm excited to play this and hope EVERYONE can enjoy it soon too!
    [deleted]
        I've only glanced the PC reviews but it doesn't seem to be "broken." There is a 60fps cap and there are apparently some controller issues on PC, seems very playable but I haven't experienced it myself.
            Also, Nier Automata itself was not broken. It wasn't a good port but it worked. I played it on PC and finished all the main endings. That guy is being dramatic.
                > It wasn't a good port but it worked

For some people.  I bought it on release and never got it working properly on my 770 even with the FAR mod, and I heard similar stories for other people with 700 series cards.  Reinstalled it later when I got a 1080 and it ran fine.
                    Yeah it specifically hated the architecture that the 700 and 960 and below ran on.
                I would call crashing every 30 min is broken.
                [deleted]
                    These issues only popped up for some people, through multiple systems I've had zero issues other than the framerate which isn't something I completely care about.  
Game never crashed, never had any issue with resolution, had online on for the entire game and multiple playthroughs without issue and this was all at launch with a pc that was pretty standard at the time (i5 4690k, 290x, 16GB DDR3) and still now with a much beefier pc I've had zero issues with the PC version (i9 9900k, 64GB DDR4, RTX 3090)
                    Can't say I noticed or experienced all of those. Framerate issues yes. I don't really have a good eye for resolution so if it was the case it didn't bother me. Don't recall getting a CTD but I might be misremembering. Also my rig would have been pretty beefy at the time so might have factored in.

I would never consider watching someone else play a game as a replacement for me playing it. Different strokes, I guess.
                        That's all fine, but yeah, Automata was *rough* on release.

I personally dealt with the Resolution issues, Lighting Issues/Artifacts, CTD's, and other things.  Still, I loved the game.
            People have to cap themselves at 60fps. It is not like the game provided an option to cap framerate or tell people to do it.
        I mean youre only robbing yourself of a great experience in favor of a shallow, vicarious experience but you do you I guess...
    [deleted]
        It did come out a bit diplomatic, huh? I just thought the polarised comments and review scores were interesting, and I hope that changes over time 🙂
        No happy. Only complains allowed.
        And your reads like it's from a bot. 

In fact, I'm not convinced it isn't.
    Of course the comments here are so critical. NieR:Automata took several years and a gigantic shit storm to **announce** an update, and the last big release - Cyberbug 2077 - had reviewers lying through their teeth because they were afraid of saying something against daddy publisher. 

Each and every single one of the scores above is meaningless, I'll wait for opinions on Reddit.
        And even these lying reviewers gave Cyberbug and AC Valhalla best reviews than this game on Metacritic lol. I’m not paying 60 bucks for an old game with a below 85 Metacritic score.
I just watched the ACG video (where isn’t this post it says wait for sale) and be absolutely says it’s worth a buy?? Might want to edit that entry.
Loved the original game on PS3 even though the combat was pretty meh. So i am definitely gonna grab this down the line.
That Eurogamer review was a little rough. It kinda read as "old game bad, play new game instead" and claims that there's no value unless you are a super fan. I played the original release a few months after Automata and there is so much that is worthwhile there and some aspects are even better than Automata. If you liked Automata then this game is absolutely worth your time.
    Agreed. I played NieR about 6 months after Automata and think I might like it better than Automata. It definitely has a lot of parts that are mediocre/bad, but the creativity and boldness of everything really shines through. And it's fun to see the more rough around the edges ideas that were attempted here and then perfected in Automata (the bullet hell, some of the non-3rd person segments). 

I'm so excited to see what this new version is like.
    I dunno.... I loved automata so, so, so much but this game is kinda just grinding on me... Slogged the first 10hours, it picked up a bit after that and then just got so dull again.... 
I've finished my first run through but I'm really struggling to find the motivation to play again...everything revealed so far was kinda predictable and I do love GW but having him sarcastically point out the game flaws I was thinking in my head did not make it charming.... Being self aware that youre doing nothing but run from point A to point B or that there's nothing original about your bosses doesn't make it any better. Kaine as a character makes me want to vomit out of my eyes and God the combat is so easy and so God damn boring! 

I'm tempted to just play the  soundtrack on loop and leave it at that! 

I totally recognise I'm in the minority, it's just not a guaranteed love
    Yea new games and game design choices are put on such a pedestal and treated as automatically objectively better than anything older than like 7 years lol. It's so absurd.
        It’s the kind of mindset in the industry that convinces people that a full remake of the last of us is a good idea. I’m not a big fan of it but even I can admit that the game has aged phenomenally.
Looks like a really good remaster/remake, if the predictable PC issues.

The combat is a real solid upgrade from the original, and fixes the main issue people had with it. The characters and narrative remains as brilliant as the original was, and the full voice acting is a great addition.

Not sure if Brother will ever quite hit as hard as Daddy Nier tho.

Man the original Nier being 68 on meta is such a joke
Looking good, looking great actually.

Now, a day or two more of users reviews and buying it if nothing changes.
I replayed the original last summer and couldn't be bothered to grind robots to get the last weapon i needed for the final ending. 

I have yet to read any of these reviews in-depth, but the mention of an additional ending is sounding like there's an even further tedious grind which is somewhat disheartening.
    Would be nice if they reduced the grind needed for all endings a bit
    Oh yeah, I forgot why I never went for all the endings until you mentioned it.
    The additional ending was something cut from the original game that was not intended require additional grinding.

Frankly, I'm surprised that you didn't get the last ending. Its very easy to grind money in that game if you exploit the farming mechanic. Nothing like Drakengard.
Do you have to play through the game multiple times like Automata?
    Yes, you need to play multiple times.  Your second (and third, and fourth) playthroughs start you off at the halfway point with all your gear and stats intact.  Since you know where you’re going and are much stronger than the enemies it’s probably only a few hours to finish each additional playthrough.
    Unlike Automata, you do actually have to play through the game multiple times to get the full story. Subsequent runs can go pretty quick since you can mostly just run past every enemy.
        How is that unlike Automata?
            In Automata the B and C runs are a good bit different from the initial A playthrough, but I understand the concept is the same and a lot of B run is similar to A. 

C on the other hand is a whole new playthrough in Automata.
            You don't replay through the same game again in Automata. Route C picks up from where route A&B left off. It's entirely new. And only about half of route B is a replay of route A.

In Replicant, you replay through the entire game each time. There are of course some minor differences, but the only one I remember is an extra cut scene near the end.
    Did you play Automata? You didn’t really play through the game multiple times, each path was a pretty different experience.
        You play the game twice, and then you get an additional chapter. But you do play it twice.
        You did though. Route B was almost a carbon copy of A story wise with some minor differences and from a different perspective(since you play as 9S.)

It's actually one of my biggest criticisms of the game. A+B could have been more organically condensed into one playthrough with C as the finale. I really can't blame people for not wanting to play the whole game again just to get to the actual good part in route C.

Thankfully if you ignore sidequests it's pretty quick to blitz through B, but you still shouldn't need to do that.
            That's my biggest gripe of the game. I never played B or C but I heard C and beyond is amazing. I didn't even enjoy route A that much so I was never compelled to play B. Feels very tedious imo.
        I did. I quit halfway through the second part. It didn't feel different enough to make it an enjoyable experience for me.

So I was curious if this game does the same thing. Because if it does, it's probably not my jam.
            It does.
            Oh trust me it turns into a whole other game shortly after where you stopped.
                That's what I've heard but I was too burned out to push through. I'm glad so many people love it but it just isn't my type of game.
        100% agree with this, I was very confused with Automata because all the reviews said you needed to beat the game multiple times to get to the true ending, when I got the true ending I thought damn, I'm going to need to do all the again!  And then I realized that people thought that 9s's part was having to play the game "again" which it isn't.  The different character perspective is the other half of part 1's story, and then part 1 and part 2 converge to push us into part 3.  Not once did I feel like I was playing the game again.  saying you have to beat the game multiple times is a massive disservice to the game, the game is told in episodes and each episode completes the experience, you can't just beat episode 1 and call it a day.
    This is something I don't get, I beat Automata, I got to the 17th and final chapter, it only took me one play through to get to the 17th chapter.  Why do people say you need to beat Automata multiple times?  You play as 2b in part 1, then you play as 9s in part 2, and then so on and so forth.  Every chapter pushes the story forward, 9s' segment is not another play through of 2b's, it's the story told from the other character which pushes the full experience forward in the next part, both converge to push the story forward.
        That's commonly called routes or playthroughs. Each character's set if levels is a route.

It isn't that complicated.
Automata is one of my favorite games ever, and I never played the original title so I saw incredibly hyped for this. I give up after 20 hours in the middle of the B run, countless FedEx quests and going back and forth between the same 3 places with boring boss fights and a very weak storyline. 

This game got me extremely frustrated and I hated 90% of it and that's why I just decided to stop. Maybe I'll pick it up again in a month or a year idk but for now, I just.. don't want to have to go through the same stuff over and over again. The A run is repetitive enough to not have to do it again like *3 times* for bits and pieces of story. There's just no incentive and nothing that would justify doing that. 

Automata managed the different routes extremely well and it *never* felt like a chore. Here, everything does. 9/20 for me.
Here's [ACG's review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaY_EeZNGPo)
I am a simple man, I see nier I buy, might have to play a less legal version after buying though as it happened with automata (thanks denuvo) yoko taro deserves the money for these masterpieces even though denuvo doesn't.
I'm 10-15hrs into the game. I'm baffled at the stark difference there is from Nier: Automata and Nier: Replicant in a bad way. I wish I felt different given how much I loved Automata, but a lot of the game in terms of story and character development is just fucking awful right now. I really hope this changes as the game progresses, but after what I'm seeing in the first 10-15 hrs, it's not looking good.
Any word on base ps4 performance? I've been slightly steered away from the PC port for the time being, but do worry if the game will run okay on my ol' ps4.
    Buttery smooth performance throughout on my PS4 Slim. No worries there imo.
Any of these games speak of performance on new consoles? Will be picking between pc or ps5 and give the issues on pc I'd love to know at least good performance/visuals on the ps5.
    Automata had horrendous post-launch support on PC.  I would strongly lean toward console for that reason alone.
Ok so, I;m actually playing it right now, I thought it was supposed to come out tomorrow?
Anyone else annoyed by R2 dodge?
PC GamesN review was all I needed to know it goes to the "Never buy" list:

* No Vsync

* No fps limiting option

* Capped at 60fps by default

* Some stuff is tied to framerate and boss fights are much harder when played above 60fps

* Stuttering when using a controller

* Randomly disconnecting controller


Man, I'm getting sick of Japanese developers and their PC ports. If you don't care, at least outsource it to a studio that knows how to do basic PC features.
    I get some of the other stuff but dude, if the game is tied to framerate then that's just it. It's not like it's stuck to 30 or something, 60 is absolutely acceptable.
    worry not! a patch is only 5 years away!
        > worry not! *the promise of* a patch is only 5 years away!

FTFY. Call me a cynic but I'll believe they're patching Automata when I see it, and I'm half expecting the patch to cause new issues even if they do.
    > Capped at 60fps by default
> 
> Some stuff is tied to framerate and boss fights are much harder when played above 60fps

erm, how those two things are possible at the same time?

edit

probably game defaults to monitor refresh rate
        Many games allow usersetting file edits to uncap frame rates. Some people do this and find out it breaks the game if physics are tied to frame rate. Not sure if it applies here but that's the scenario where both could apply.
        Uncapping the frame rate with 3rd party software.

    What does no FPS limit and capped at 60 FPS mean? Aren't those contradicting each other?
        They mean a custom fps limit, in case someone wants to cap it to a value below 60.

Edit: I have read that this info is wrong and the game doesn't actually have an fps cap option, despite behaving strangely at any framerate higher than 60.
        The game is capped at 60fps by default, but you can't set any other framerate limits within the game. There is no option for it.
            But then:

> Some stuff is tied to framerate and boss fights are much harder when played above 60fps

If there's a FPS cap of 60 how is the quoted text happening?
            What other framerate limit would you set? A limit of 120 would clearly be unnecessary since it's already capped at 60.
    > Man, I'm getting sick of Japanese developers and their PC ports. If you don't care, at least outsource it to a studio that knows how to do basic PC features.

If anything we've been getting some very very good PC ports from japanese companies lately with all the atlus and squenix rpgs on steam.
    These aren’t really that big of a deal tbh. I’ll be picking up the game if there’s nothing major like Automata’s port.
    >No fps limiting option

>Capped at 60fps by default

How can it be both at the same by time?
    I'll be honest, all of those things you listed are important to me. But if you won't even consider a game without them, you're missing out like crazy.
    > * No Vsync

Ahh thats fine, ive got a freesync monitor.

> * No fps limiting option

No biggie, itll run a little hot and the frame pacing wont be perfect. I can live with it.

> * Capped at 60fps by default

Okay, a little INI tinkering maybe but this isnt the wor...

> * Some stuff is tied to framerate and boss fights are much harder when played above 60fps

Oh god please, why havent these companies learned from the original Dark Souls 1 PC release? Or DS2 before Scholars for that matter.

> * Stuttering when using a controller

*sigh* hopefully fixable at least?

> * Randomly disconnecting controller

Just fucking end my life. a $3 game made by 1 dude that takes 2 hours to complete can find a way to integrate xbox controller support or use the steam api and work flawlessly. This shit is just laziness. At some point, just dont do a PC release. if youre going to give me a middle finger, put some pizazz on it.
        >Oh god please, why havent these companies learned from the original Dark Souls 1 PC release? Or DS2 before Scholars for that matter.

You.. You know this game before darksouls 1 right? And that you can't just magically change the game engine from connecting logic to framerate?
            > You.. You know this game before darksouls 1 right?

Well this game comes out tomorrow, in 2021. Its a remake, with substantial changes, one of them should have been this frame rate nonsense.

> And that you can't just magically change the game engine from connecting logic to framerate?

Then explain what happened with dark souls 2, where the base game had this issue and others, then the DLC came out and they fixed it? Shit, even emulators running BoTW on PC have unlinked framerates and engine features like speed for the sake of fidelity, and they didnt even develop the game.
            This is remake and not original old game. Improvements like higher framerate should be expected not excused. If they want to charge $60+ for PC port then put some effort into it.
It's pretty funny how so many people are hyped over a game that no one liked when it originally released all because they changed the font and overall theme to look like Automata.
    idk, combat looks alot more fun than it did on PS3
    I mean, the combat, graphics and performance where the main reasons it got bad reviews while this is all new assets, a new combat system and solid performance.
I want to play this. But I'm scared to play it because how awful Square Enix been with patches for the game prior. It's been awful!  


So I'll probably wait.
60fps is completely fine for a AAA game. 120fps+ is really nice though. Makes higher mouse sensitivity feel much better.  

Seeing the problems with automata at launch and how long it took to address them, it is extremely reasonable to wait a week or two to see if there are similar issues that are common.
Well, time to avoid major streamers since they will be spoiling the game for everyone. Never understood early access for story based games for people to stream early. (I am aware this is a remake)
    Or youtube in general. I have recently been listening to Nier Automata OST at work, and youtube started recommending me videos that contain spoilers in thumbnails and in their titles.
        Listened to the soundtrack today and the first recommended video was a video about the endings with spoilers in the thumbnail. So damn frustrating.
    [deleted]
        Problem is the amount of recommendations and Stream titles with major spoilers, and auto run streams in guide websites like Fextralife.

Also thats why i said i was going to avoid major streamers so i dont spoil the game. :)
        > Huh? They're not spoiling anything. If you go to someone's stream when they're playing a game you're spoiling it for yourself.

Meanwhile if you go on Youtube after so much as even thinking of clicking on a trailer 5 years ago, you can expect videos with Thumbnails and/or Titles showing major plot/ending events showing up in your recommended feed for the next month or so.
If I haven't played Nier Automata yet, which one should I play first? This remake or Automata?
    Replicant. Automata is the sequel.
    Remake then Automata. People will tell you that you can skip the original but that's just completely wrong. The entire premise of Automata spoils the original NieR.
    I played Automata first and I didn’t feel too lost, but this remake is the original so if you want to go chronological then play the remake first.
    I would go with Replicant, the gameplay is a bit more modern in Automata, even if they tried to modernise Replicant a little bit. The jump will be kinda jarring i feel if you go Automata then Replicant.
    Automata spoils this game, so play this first
    it... doesn't really matter. They're both pretty standalone.

That being said, playing Replicant first will give you more context for like two things in Automata while Automata won't give you any additional context for Replicant (...probably) so if all else is equal, play Replicant first.
The original Nier got rated about a 65 or so after all was said and done on Metacritic.

So I can't help but feel a lot of these 10/10 and 5/5 scores are heavily influenced by it's resulting place as a cult classic. How does a game that barely rated at all now swing near the top of the charts with a minor polish up?
    The biggest problems with the original were the controls and gameplay, all of which were very clunky. Those seem to be both addressed in this version, plus updated graphics, more content, and re-recorded audio. So plenty of opportunity to improve the scores.
        The "awfulness" of the controls in the original were absurdly overblown.
            As someone who just played through the original and finished it yesterday, agreed.  People just wanted another God of War, probly.
    Look at Cyberpunk. Reviewers just say what they think people want to hear.
        Absolutely right. Reviewers willingly ignored a *lot* with that, up to and including how they weren't offered the console versions, to comply with the NDA. Let's not forget it was floating in the 90s on the day the embargo lifted.
I'm enjoying the game but it's definitely not worth full AAA price, it feels like a big step down from Automata and you can definitely tell this was a game originally made 10 years ago.
Will they do a optimization patch for PS5 ? Or will have to play it on the PS4
    I doubt the PS5 will play it *worse* than playing it on PS4, but there are no enhancements outside of innate things like slightly faster loading - it’s still stuck at 1080p, for instance.
    You mean the PS4 version? As of now, there's no Series X or PS5 patch that's been announced.
Are you able to play as the older protagonist from the western version of the original release?
wtf is up with this developer and their shitty pc ports? either have another company port it for you or don't bother releasing it on pc. this is inexcusable, especially after the Automata port.
    Two entirely different companies made Automata and Replicant
One of the greatest games I've ever played. Glad to see new people are able to be introduced to it now.
It sounds not too different than Automata, which I had a hard time enjoying even though I really wanted to. Was hoping this one would be different.
    Automata is that kind of game that lives on its quirkyness, unexpected twists and turns and plot. If that doesn't sounds interesting it's likely to bore the hell out of you. 

I'm satisfied I stuck with it but I wanted to break the disc during the second route because the hacking minigame was an irritation.

I suppose Replicant is very similar.
        Well, if they make another of these games, perhaps they should inject some of that quirkiness a little earlier.
            It's a long setup to subvert player's expectations. It works sometimes, but it really expects you to hold on and wait for weird stuff to happen.

The third playthrough of Automata's is absolutely brilliant and the highest point of the game, but even then it takes some two or three awful hours to go through and during that time you also have to deal with some of the worst things in the game, and that's after you already sunk a lot of time in the first two playthroughs (The second being legendarily bad, in my honest opinion). It's really frustrating, but it's a game for people who really want to experience things that are not in any other games.

Hell, one of my favorite games is Pathologic and that game is a misery simulator, so I do know the feeling. If you really aren't into in that postmodernist payoff - which, to be honest, might just not be your thing. FF7R was *not* my thing. Dark Souls is *not* my thing. Persona 5 just *isn't* my thing. I'm not trying to make you look like *you just don't get it* - this probably isn't very interesting.

If anything, the real value of the game (I found the plot fairly mundane) is its experimental nature, and games like these are few and far between, hence why fans hold these in high praises.

Personally I like weird games and imaginative monsters design and that seems to be hiding somewhere in this game. It's not really all that deep for me.
                > It's really frustrating, but it's a game for people who really want to experience things that are not in any other games.
>
> is its experimental nature, and games like these are few and far between, hence why fans hold these in high praises.

I could kinda see a glimmer of that in the game. For example, I accidentally triggered Ending 'K' by eating the fish in the desert, and that was odd but funny, and I liked that. So I know what you mean, and I appreciate things like that too. I'm not adverse to experimental games myself, I freaking love Death Stranding for example and it seemed like a lot of gamers didn't care for that one. I like trying new things, but Automata just didn't click for me personally. Like you said, it's a long setup to wait for the good stuff, and while I am a patient person I simply have less interest in it after slogging through the first playthrough.

> FF7R was not my thing. Dark Souls is not my thing. Persona 5 just isn't my thing.

I am currently playing the original FF7 before I try the remake, but I liked the demo. I have not played any of the Persona games, but they have piqued my interest. Dark Souls however I am a *huge* fan of, so maybe that says something about me as a gamer.
    If you didn't enjoy Automata why would you even consider that you might enjoy Replicant? I thought Automata was a master piece lol.
        Because there's *something* underneath the aspects I didn't like that's inspired and good. If they made the rest of the game a little more interesting where it counted, it could've changed my opinion of it tremendously. So a complete remake of the first game had potential to do that, but according to the reviews it's apparently quite similar to Automata in all the ways I didn't like. Even the GameSpot review gave it a 9/10 while calling it bad in some ways (my emphasis added):

> It's great that this game, which is a bit hard to get a hold of nowadays, has been faithfully recreated, faults and all. But you can't overlook how its dated aspects--even by 2010 standards--make for an antiquated experience. This means that, as a whole, **gameplay is more of a vehicle for Nier Replicant's story**, and the act of playing it puts some of its key narrative themes into important context.
>
> **This game tests your patience** but the payoff is immense. It's worth jumping through the necessary hoops in order to see every aspect of Nier Replicant's various conclusions. You just wouldn't get the full picture otherwise, and the full picture is wholly satisfying.
>
>"Endings" is a bit of a misnomer with regards to Nier. Subsequent playthroughs help recontextualize what you've seen before, offering additional crucial perspectives. This approach is valuable for the narrative style and messaging of Nier, as **it utilizes repetition** to communicate some affecting themes. Re-experiencing chunks of the game means the series of events are familiar, so the additional context captures your undivided attention, often leaving you questioning yourself or experiencing a revelation about a particular story beat you initially didn't think much of at first.
>
>Nier Replicant doesn't make you play the entire game over again, **but with a few obtuse requirements, it can wear you down, especially by the time you make it to the third route.** 

They don't make the game sound fun to me. Obviously there's something great underneath the unfun parts, and I wish I could experience that, so I was hoping they'd improve in that regard and apparently it is no different.
Never seen so many weird nonsensical bitchy comments before. Are people fired up to hate this game already lol.
I got convinced to try Automata. I was hesitant because of 2B's character design. 

Ended up finding Automata to be a masterpiece. 

There isn't a reason for me to not play Replicant, right? Don't have much time to play games, but I can fit an hour or two in a day.
    [deleted]
        2B was typical anime fan service for no real reason, it's just kinda gross.
            It wasn't for no reason, though. Doll-like clothing is sometimes used in anime art to convey an emotionless personality and/or someone abused by others as merely an object. The blindfold (and its eventual removal) is also very significant in the context of the story.

Fans were inevitably going to exploit the style, and the creators leaned into that, but it was definitely not for no real reason. And I'm the kind of person who can't stand it when people say "it was intentional" to justify bad design.
                It's literally for no reason except for having the character be sexually appealing, as per Yoko Taro interviews though lmao.  This is on par with excusing Quiet's character design because "She breathes through her skin!!!"
        Yeah, the whole french maid vibe looked dumb. Still kinda think it is, but it grew on me.
    I watched a playthrough of Replicant (the original version) on Youtube, and it seemed like a perfect companion to Automata. Lots of similar themes and story beats, but in a good way. I'm psyched to finally get to play this myself.
This game looks like ass. I felt like I accidentally used my old 360 and not my ps5. Shit I played games on the 360 that looked better than this. The Graphics are worts than anything if seen on ps4 or xb1 so far and this game is also playable on next gen. How can anyone call this a Graphical update.
    > How can anyone call this a Graphical update.

Are you [brain damaged](https://imgur.com/a/7PgrvZc)?
Original was too easy on Normal and too hard on Hard. How about this?

Also, I got stuck in the fishing mini game for a long time.
I’ve barely touched Automata. Should I play Replicant first before going back to that one?
    Yes
Well well, the game that killed Cavia studio is finally getting the praise it deserved.  I remember picking it up when it first came out and I just loved it. My bro bought ffxiii and i grabbed nier. After months passed I actually bought copies for my friends because it became so cheap.

I recall the original nier came out the same day as ffxiii so it got overshadowed.  Square Enix was the publisher for this game too, so they guaranteed this game would sell poorly by doing that.  

While I'll miss Daddy nier (i prefer the father daughter relationship to the brother sister one)  I think this remake/remaster will still be as memorable as the first time i played the og. 
l'll be interested to see if the text adventure is still in the game or if they will add any of the cut content?
I'm confused... Is this a sequel or a remake?
    [deleted]
Playing Nier for the first time... cake day and all.

It's not an earth shattering next-gen game or anything but it feels like a solid remaster, at least on console.
Also, what constitutes a “good” game evolves like anything else.  Unconventional games that emphasize story/music/art tend to do better now than before from what I can remember.

My past review experience is based off magazines though because I’m old.  Back then focus seemed to be on graphical output, technical cohesiveness and core gameplay.  Could just be misremembering though.
    To be fair, the original Nier's gameplay wasn't exactly anything to write home about. If the characters, setting, aesthetics and story don't hook you I could totally understand why you'd think it was a mediocre game.

But yeah I think a lot more critics nowadays are willing to tolerate average/bad gameplay if the rest of the game is unique and interesting, so games like Nier will do better. Probably on account of the average reviewer being much older than when I was a teen and having become jaded to gameplay on account of having played all of the millions of technically competent but extremely similar made-by-committee sequel and copycat games that the industry churns out regularly. Which is probably also why critics nowadays tend push indie games a lot more too since those are more likely to take big risks and be weird and different.
        As someone who played it to completion on release, the gameplay was kinda awful.

Big gameplay flaws :

* The combat was very weak when compared with contemporaries like Kingdom Hearts.

* The side quests consisted almost entirely of mundane kill x of a specific monster fetch quests

* The weapon upgrade system amounted to grinding one room in one dungeon for tens of hours for one rare drop that was needed in everything.

* Fishing.

Sure there was story, but even at the time of playing, the weight of the poor gameplay was palpable and caused the experience to be a total slog.

That doesn't even speak to the technical issues that resulted in huge spikes of lag and frame drops everywhere. 

I don't care how compelling the story was; the game deserved a 7/10. And honestly, you were drip fed so little of it at any given time that it was hard to piece it all together against the gameplay. I ended up just reading summaries on gamefaqs after beating it all to have it one place.
            I played the game to completion on release as well and I fully agree with this. I have found memories of the story but I remember kinda hating the janky combat. I also remember discovering a spear-dash into dodge-roll combo that basically broke the entire combat system because it let you do hit-and-run attacks while being almost untouchable so you didn't need to bother learning enemy attack patterns anymore.

Honestly my very first concern when I heard about the remaster was to pray that they fix the combat system because as much as love Nier, I'm not willing to replay it again unless the gameplay is improved.
                it feels much better. magic and melee is woven together way more smoothly, and although the combos don't have anything on automata ( makes sense. these aren't combat androids ) it's definitely an enjoyable experience this time.
    Yeah that game came out at the peak of games fitting x model for success. That was just after even nintendo caved into making an edgier zelda because people wanted grim and dirty.
        Twilight princess came out nearly 6 years before iirc
            Plot twist: They are talking about >!The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds that launched in 2013!<

>!I'm joking!<

>!Unless...!<
        Nah TP was supposed to be another OOT-like(a somber, at times quite dark game whos original release even included bleeding enemies during combat & some cutscenes) and it was a direct reaction to the spaceworld Zelda demo showcasing the potential of the GC. The demo was done in OOT/MM like artstyle and people expected a return to form for the Zelda franchise after MM(3.3 million sales) failed to sell as much as OOT(7.6m). 

Later on Nintendo revealed the next zelda with a childrens cartoon aesthetic the opposite of OOTs at times dark and more realistic style. The fan reaction... was not pretty. WW(4.4m) didn't sell so much either, TP became the next game in development and it garnered massive hype throughout its dev cycle. TP ended selling so much it broke franchise records selling 8.8 million units.
    That would depend on the magazine I think. :)

Definitely from the mid 2000s PC gamer was more into the overall experience. Back into the 90s Amiga magazines I read would do the "graphics, sound, gameplay" scores and add them up.
    Nier wasn't a good game though by standards then and now. Amazing story and soundtrack but environments were extremely dull and boring and combat was lame. As long as they fixed those two things, which it seems like they have, the game should be great.
It's really interesting, actually -- even on this version of Nier, the book on it is definitely "it gets really good, but it takes about 10 hours to get there". 

So Nier was a new IP that seemed pretty generic and is not interesting for the first 10 hours -- I think a lot of critics gave up on it way before it turned into something different (and that's totally justifiable, to be clear, 10 hours is long-ass time). But now Yoko Taro is known as a genius auteur, Nier is a beloved franchise, the cult following for this game is well-known, and people are willing to give it the benefit of the doubt.
    Hardly seems fair to judge any story game with out finishing it. I can do it cuz I'm just some fucking guy and if it doesn't hold my attention so that's fine, but if it's your job to review a game, seems you should have to finish at least the story before you can give a fair assessment. Imagine writing a review on a movie you didn't finish.
        I think there's a big difference between a movie that lasts between 90 and 180 minutes, and a game that could take 30-40 hours, especially when you've gotta get a review out on deadline. There's a certain point, I think for me it's about 5 hours into a game like this, where it's totally reasonable to bail if you're not hooked.
            well sure, but thats if you're not a reviewer.   


im sorry but I could never trust a reviewer that bails on a 40 hour game 5 hours in unless its just absolutely terrible or not fun.   


if you try to review a 40 hour game that you've only played 5 hours of, you shouldnt be reviewing it at all. maybe it can be part of a smaller segment where you give your two cents, but a full review? I dont know if thats fair. 

but I do think there there are exceptions. for example girlfriend reviews recently did a video on persona 5. that game can run any where from 60 to 200 hours of game play depending on how much you try to do. Persona 5 is, I think for day one reviewers anyway, a hard game to review for because its so damn long. That said, they did mention that they were going to finish the game and if I recall correctly provide a follow up. But they did get a good way through it, I even saw them playing on twitch at a part of the game that takes like any where from 20 to 60 hours to get to so they definitely saw more than the first 5% of the game.   


I just think for a FULL proper review of any given game, you gotta see the story out to the end at least.
                If a game isnt fun in the first 5 hours it's a bad game, sorry.  Why would I want to slog through 5 or 10 hours of boredom for it to maybe get good when there are fun games I can play instead?

Reviewers should finish games but for the opposite reason, to identify if games just use cheap tricks to make you think its good in the demo but with no satisfying story or endgame
        For me, if the game isnt good within the first 30 minutes then I'm not going to keep playing. Time is a valuable resource to me, and I like to think most people feel the same.
            I don't really think that's a viable rule to follow for most RPGs tbh
                I think it matters for any game. It's not about everything being great but if there's nothing that hooks you in the first 30-60 minutes why keep wasting your time?

It can be anything, graphics, combat, dialogues, voice acting, anything really but there has to be something compelling and this will be different for each person and each game.
                Most games rely on a loop of actions. If I'm not enjoying the loop then it's probably just not for me.
I think a lot of people in western games journalism just weren't used to JRPGs at the time, however original nier and drakengard 3 ran like absolute garbage and still do on the PS3 so I'm not the least bit surprised by parts of the scores those games got. Drakengard 3 was so bad that it would get down to 10fps during fights.
    Drakengards' performance was bad but I'm pretty the original Nier ran pretty well especially for a ps3/xbox 360 title.
        Having just replayed both nier and drakengard 3 on ps3, holy mother of god D3’s performance was genuinely baffling. I have no idea how it got released in that state. Nier was great :)
            Honestly, Saying the frame rate was trash was being generous

And this is coming from someone who lord the game and the franchise.
It seems like a lot of the reviewers this time around had played and were fans of the original. I imagine that's a significant factor for the jump in score.

I wonder how this game would be received by players new to the series.
When NieR was released on PS3 there was someone from Kotaku (i guess) who wasted like 3 hours trying to fish something outside the tutorial area... so he obviously didn't got anything and couldn't progress in the game but he never noticed he was doing everything wrong.

Yeah people really hated NieR back in the day, a lot of journalists not even finished it 2 times.
    It was Joystiq, and he did eventually notice he was doing something wrong. He never did a full review for it I don't think
The story, characters, and music where already fantastic in the first one, it was mostly letdown by its gameplay/combat.

The combat was functional but not very fluid, fun, or balanced. Some weapons/skills where so underwhelming there was never a time to use them, and some skills/weapons so strong there was no point to use anything else (spears where so overpowered that Im fairly certain I was able to use a spear + dmg amps to take out the last boss in less than 10 hits)

There are also a lot of parts that are text based they require you to answer some questions based off details given in the text story. It's a neat idea but executed in a way that makes its very long-winded and boring, especially if you get any of the questions wrong (and you probably will) because it makes you sit through way too much of the text story stuff again only to realize the details change every time so you fuck up and have to it again! Basically a not very fun part of the game.

From what I've come to understand this gsme had the guys from platinum that headed the combat for N:A overseeing the combat for this game so I have high hopes.
This thread is hilarious because it's the opposite of the original's reception. Reviews are giving it acclaim while the users here are all complaining about it (for issues they haven't even actually seen yet).
    People are complaining about the technical issues. It's indeed strange because they haven't even tried it yet, but those are valid concerns.
        I'm playing on PS5 I haven't had any issues so far, just my personal experience
            Complaints come from PC gamers, which have been already been burned by Automata's horrible PC port.
    Really fond of the commenters bemoaning that it's locked to 60fps on PC, and also that it has problems over 60fps. 

It has a couple of clear issues but inconveniences more than game breakers and focusing on them isn't missing the forest for the trees as much as it's missing the entire pacific northwest for a few ugly leaves.
        I can’t imagine skipping a classic because you can’t play it above 60fps.
            Hell, I highly doubt the original was playing at 60fps to begin with. So, it's definitely not a good reason to pan this game.
                You're right. Gestalt was 30 FPS max (besides emulation hacks), and it sometimes went into the teens: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmYONPPAag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmYONPPAag)
                The original was not a PC game, came out during the 360/PS3 era where games had awful sub 30fps framerate and was a low budget title made by a subpar dev team(ignoring Taro's talent).

This is a PC game following up an incredibly successful game that sold 5.5million units being released in the year of flying cars: 2021. Not at all comparable.
            A game locked at 30fps might give me pause, but anything over 60fps is more of a luxury for most games. Over 120hz I genuinely can't tell the difference most of the time.
                It might be a case of getting used to something, I have been playing pc games on 4K for the past 2 years, and playing a game at 1080p feels like I'm playing on 144p. I never played on 144hz but from what I hear it's hard to go back. (Not that I think its a reason to ignore a classic game like this, hell, bloodborne is locked to 30 and I will forever recommend it)
                    I agree, but I think there's probably a point with framerate where you hit diminishing returns. Like, from 30-60 is a world of difference, but 60-144 is felt less in games with without twitchy camera movements, and 144-240hz even less so. For me, I don't see any difference over 144hz even in shooters.
                        The difference between 60 to 144 is like 38fps vs 60fps (frame time wise); still a very noticeable difference and hard to go back to. Not sure about 240hz+ though
                    I guess it depends on the person, but I have no problem playing games even at 30 fps after experiencing 144 Hz. Over time I realized that cosistent frame times are far more important to me than frame rate (ideally I'd want both of course). Also, VRR is a godsend, especially on displays over 60 Hz.
                    I think the 144hz argument is only true for some game types. Yeah playing something that requires fast reaction times like a FPS will definitely feel worse if you're under 144FPS. But I can can go back to skyrim and not really feel any worse with its locked framerate.
            Right? Who are these people?
                PC gamers.
                I see melodramatic comments like that on here all the time that get pretty good reception. I just chalk it up to the extremists of an already fringe community. Most normal people really don't give a shit.
        You're right, 60FPS is fine. What isn't fine is that animations are tied to the framerate. This has been a big no-no in games for over the past decade. If your framerate goes above or below 60fps weird things can start to happen.

>There are no options for VSync and framerate limit, which is important because running it above 60fps speeds Replicant’s animations up, making boss fights much harder than they should be. A regular stutter, which seems to be linked to a controller issue on Steam, is equally annoying – mine would periodically disconnect during these stutters...

PC gamers should probably wait for Digital Foundry to release an analysis on the game.
            Tying gameplay to framerate is dubious programming but not unheard of.  But tying gameplay to framerate without limiting the framerate is just trolling.
            Breath of the wild did it
        > Really fond of the commenters bemoaning that it's locked to 60fps on PC, and also that it has problems over 60fps.
> 
> 

It's 2021, that shit isn't really acceptable anymore.
            I could not give less of a shit about a framerate so long as it runs at 60fps, but the point I'm making is if it's locked to 60 then you can't exactly complain that it functions incorrectly above 60. That's the same criticism twice.
            Dude it runs at 60 fps. I have everything I would need to run it at 144hz 1440p but I don't care.

These are technical hurdled imposed by time, you gotta know when things are big enough to justify the work to rework the engine and events
                Agreed. It's wild to think that many games were stuck at 30fps on the generation of consoles that *just* ended, and people are already treating 120fps as mandatory instead of a luxury.
                    no better way to get developers to raise their standards of output quickly, though.
            [deleted]
                Yeah really. If I can go up over 60 that's awesome I love extra high fps, but 60 solid is the goal and 144 is brownie points.
                [deleted]
                    [deleted]
            Imagine skipping a masterpiece because 60fps isn't enough. Lmfao
    People who comment on online gaming forums care more about technical minutiae than the audience most reviewers are writing for.
I actually revisited the original about a year ago in anticipation for this (I knew that a "remaster" would never be just that with a Yoko Taro game), and I think the original holds up surprisingly well. 

I'm kind of confused as to the cold reception it got at release. The combat is just *fine* sure, but the game is still completely engaging even ten years later.
    Honestly, the original Nier holds up pretty well and is a lot more engaging than other JRPGs of the time and even the endless brown/grey shooters that everyone loved back then. The combat isn't the best but it's fun enough for what it is.
    Interesting. I haven’t played it in a long, long time but IMO the “just fine” combat was worth putting up with for what I got in return. It really is THAT good and I think from a narrative standpoint it is a bit better than Automata as well.
        Absolutely. The combat was serviceable, and that's all it needed to be.

I think I still like Automata more overall, but that's completely from a taste/personal preference. I don't think I could make any kind of argument as to Automata being an objective improvement but rather just an expansion of some of the ideas in the original.

Both are absolutely some of my favorite games ever.
            When I saw that Platinum was attached to Automata I screamed an internal “fuck yes” because Nier already had the Yoko Taro and Okabe secret sauce. Pair that with Platinum’s flair and you get one of my favorite games ever too, in nearly every aspect.
                Did you guys like the combat in Automata? I was really excited about Platinum being involved and I loved the game overall, but I found the combat sub par. I hate how the optimal way to play is to hold in the shoot button at all times.
                    Again, I think it's serviceable. I think it's better than the original Nier's combat, but it's nothing all that special. I appreciate that it's non-intrusive. I know platinum excels at intricate combat systems but I appreciate that Nier Automata isn't quite as in-depth as a Bayonetta or what have you.
                    I'm not far in, but that's probably my one thing. I don't like having to hold down the trigger *forever*.
                        >I'm not far in,

Get off this subreddit before you see spoilers!
                            No >:D
                        It gets old really fast and it's even worse on higher difficulties when you take insane dmg at close range and thus has to rely more on range attacks to kill spongey enemies. Automata is one of those games were I kind of regret not going for the easy mode.
                            As someone who just finished route A on hard, I almost never had to use my ranged attack, like at all (except the ship part of course).

EDIT: Oh, I think the only time I used ranged attack is against the centipede in the castle.
                                I think they're saying the held the trigger down the entire time they were in combat while using the melee attacks. 

If I remember right, there's an option to just toggle it on and off. Either that or the attack was so weak I just didn't bother with it anyway. I know I wasn't holding the trigger down the entire time.
                    It’s definitely Platinum’s weaker ones, but it’s still pretty slick, flashy and badass which I love.
                    I would go so far to say the combat is substanceless. The game has great aesthetics, themes and character performances, but the one thing holding back is... its gameplay
                        Definitely disagree with you there. IMO the big pitfall of automatas combat is just that it rewards certain mashable strategies, but if you really learn the intricacies of the combat it’s absolutely not completely lacking of substance. You can be pretty creative when you know what to do, [like this guy does.](https://youtu.be/d3Eh0jbddmk)

I understand your point of view though because instead of all that flashy stuff you *could* just spam evade and sprinting heavy attack. But i believe they just wanted to make the game very easily accessible. If you want to take the combat to the next level, you can.
                    I started enjoying it quite a bit after replaying the game on Very Hard. Learning how to control groups and isolate enemies with extended juggles by using animation cancels made the experience much more satisfying, as did actually learning boss attack patterns. It's not the best combat system out there, but it's more than just serviceable in my opinion. 

Although, the game certainly is at fault if dying in one hit is the only way it can make me learn attack patterns. Healing is way too forgiving and powerful enemies should have some level scaling.
                    it had good animation and sound design (putting it above most other action RPGs) but you could basically mash your way through everything and dodging was easy. It was also really easy to break the RPG side to trivialize things further. It's no DMC or Bayonetta but still fun.
                    Automata's combat was pretty shallow especially for Platinum but I didn't really tire of it until a couple of playthroughs in. I honestly can't remember if I played it on hard or very hard but a lot of things (especially in the early game) practically one-shot me so combat became a kind of hokey cokey dance of dipping in and out, spinning around (i.e. spamming dodge). Once I got a feel for it I actually really enjoyed it, had its own rhythm and its beautifully animated. I liked it enough to go out of my way to make it look as flashy as possible (sliding about on sand was a particular favourite of mine), which helped make up for the lack of depth to a point.
                    The level scaling and instant healing are both busted as well. The former makes it a complete slog to kill anything significantly higher level than you, while the latter makes anything that isn't a one hit kill almost meaningless.

Combat looks cool and the characters are fun to control, but the actual combat design is awful.
        >  It really is THAT good and I think from a narrative standpoint it is a bit better than Automata as well.

Both the narrative and the characters were better than Automata
            Debatable. 

Automata had better VA performances, and emotions.

But to a character like Kainé, 9S/2B/A2 don't hold a candle.

Overall, Automata is superior though.
                > 
> Automata had better VA performances, and emotions.

VA performance don't really impact on whether a character is better or not though, that's just production stuff. And Kaine VA > all of Automata.

>Overall, Automata is superior though.

It was the more well rounded game. It had better pacing and combat, while still having a solid story. But Gestalt will always be way more of a memorable game for me, in big part because Automata's android characters just didn't hit the same way as emil/kaine/weiss
    i think the biggest issue is that it was a glaringly low budget game. ultimately automata was just far easier to market to a wider audience with platinum and the 2B ass memes, all gestalt/replicant had was "wait this game has godlike music and writing and the gameplay blows" as its tag line
        Also, Platinum Games made Automata. It's not even necessary to watch a gameplay to know that a game made by them will have a great frenetic, fast paced, fun combat. Everyone expects that. Can't say the same about Cavia, who *was* known for its... anime games?
    As someone who got about 10 hours in then bounced off when it first came out, I think the original Nier wasn't *bad*, but it lacked a clear identity and that can be frustrating for players early on. It tried to weave a mystery but felt more like an erratic, messy narrative. And the combat was... Serviceable, but boring. And the weird, Yoko Taro flair of layered endings, multiple playthroughs to get the full story and bizarre canonization of Drakengard.

My guess is by riding the wave of Nier Automata's success by iterating and improving on much of the above, some better tech and reliable recognition, it made sense to revisit this and modernize it.
    > I'm kind of confused as to the cold reception it got at release.

NieR was released at a time when Japan's influence in the west was at an all time low and every western dev was aping Gears Of War. If your game wasn't brown, grey, or starred a dude who shot a gun and looked like they ate steroids for breakfast, then it was probably going to be largely ignored.
        The original NieR was largely brown and its starring dude did look like he eats steroids for breakfast.
            Yeah, Papa NieR only exists because Yoko Taro was trying to appeal to the west. Fat lot of good that did. If we're being honest though, the main "problem" with NieR was that it was a Japanese game that didn't fit in into the traditional mold.
                And video game reviewers are on average kind of shit at reviewing narratives.
                I still prefer Papa Nier compared to Brother Nier just on the basis that I like the narrative of a father saving their child more than a sibling saving them ... Both are still great however
        Nier was all of that, minus the gun. It was ignored because it was grindy as fuck and the gameplay was ass.
            I don’t think you can blame the Ending C and D grind since most reviewers probably didn’t even get there.
    The game looked like crap, ran like crap and had tonnes of grind and repetition. Combine that with the shallow combat, lack of QoL features, other jank like the dumb party AI, and even some messy story bits, I think the reception was pretty well justified back then.
    I was just playing it this morning. I couldn't wait and had to scratch my itch for it, haha. I feel like it holds up fine.

Honestly the worst part of the game for me can be the fishing mini game, but moreso that it's just a bit enraging at times.
    I think its a combination of factors, mostly that mainstream gaming media wasn't quite at the point then where it was ready to judge the appeal of games on something other than marketing bullet points (i.e. that a game could be valuable as an aesthetic or emotional experience instead of just as a "game") and there weren't many platforms yet for fans to talk up its good points. Its also important to remember that games like Nier weren't actually all that uncommon in the 6th and early 7th gen. "Weird , mid market Japanese games" came out pretty regularly, and while they rarely became mainstream hits they were still common enough that you could find them lining the shelves of just about any game store. Weird arty games like Ico and Shadow of the Collossus were huge, and even Drakengard 1 was a modest hit for the time. And Nier was competing in the same space as games like Demon's Souls, it was a niche but a reasonable crowded one where you could be a little spoiled for choice. So a game just having a unique aesthetic might not be enough to carry it. But now that they've become less common, and interest/acceptance has risen in the mainstream thanks to break out hits like Yakuza 0, Nier: Automata, and Dark Souls, its gotten easier to look back and reevaluate these things for what they were rather than for how they didn't conform with the expectations of the time.
OG Nier is probably the most hilariously wrong metacritic score of a game ever, a whole bunch of reviewers that had no idea what they were reviewing
    I wouldn't say that. It's a game that has flawed or mediocre graphics and gameplay, but great writing and music. I can't fault reviewers for scoring it based off of all of it's attributes rather than just it's best ones. It's not a game for everyone
    It does give it a certain mystique tho lol. I’m not sure if this is due to Automata’s success but it has a certain aura and reputation about it. I really, really hope this remaster allows more peeps to give it a shot.
        The best part of the remake to me is definitely that all the people that missed it originally, because it fell under the radar, get to experience one of the most memorable games I can think of
    IDK I think I thought about it long enough that the remake was announced and sounds like a better iteration of the game. The original was often called "ultra interesting" but a chore to play.
        Those people never played Drakengard
            I'm watching and longplay and what the fuck and why on earth.

It does look like mediocre gameplay with an interesting plot but it's just so weird.
                Its a really bizarre game that the secret ending leads into Nier. Its set up like a Dynasty Warriors game but the entire game, the music, the graphics, the gameplay, the story are all designed to make you paranoid and agitated.
                    I can see that regarding eveyrthing but the gameplay. It just looks mindless as hell, like a Dynasty Warriors game without the spectacular. Kinda like the first Onechambara.

Then it all goes to what in the fuck land in the final third. I'm kinda glad for these games longplays are a thing. Due to a lack of hardware I can't really play these games right now (man I'd love if Sony gave a shit about BC for these kind of games. Also Valkyrie Profile), but at least I can see and somehow know what are they about.

Seriously that ending with the **Spoiler:** >!flying demonic babies!<. I saw that years ago somehow and thought it was a nightmare I had, and even when I started looking into Taro's games I had an idea this was it and could not figure out how it ended up like that.
                        "It just looks mindless as hell" - yeah that sounds pretty unnerving and agitating since you dont need to think and all you hear is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NocSlsBJHxY&ab_channel=Durandana
                            [deleted]
    Or maybe it had some problems not everyone is willing to overlook.
        I'm not saying its a perfect game, it had plenty of flaws. But if you compare to every other game that has a 68 meta score....

It got done poorly mostly because it was a JRPG coming out at that time, and because it wasn't big budget
    I think reviewers definitely knew what they were playing then.  
  
I got OG Nier at release. It already looked worse than other games already on the market and already felt like it was made in a budget. The voice acting was just okay and only really serviceable if you were into anime voice actors. The gameplay was alright, but wasn’t exactly exceptional either. The only real highlight was the fact that it incorporated bullet hell aspects into it, which was very new for the time. And the story, atleast intro-wise, was just kind of standard, but there were better looking and more polished action RPGs already at the time. The game was also somewhat buggy.  
  
The game was totally reviewed fairly back when it released. The story, for how good it actually ends up being, doesn’t make up for every other aspect of the game just being “okay”, especially considering how much work you have to put in to really get to the meat of the story.
        > The voice acting was just okay

Sorry, but you're crazy.
            That I think it’s just okay? Should I have thought it was better? Because I have my OG copy of the game and the voice acting was just alright. Not bad by any means, but wasn’t exactly top tier by any means either.  
  
At the time, it was just standard anime voice actors. If that floats your boat, that’s totally cool. But it wasn’t top tier
                Nah the voice acting is some of the best of the time.
                    Considering all the other games of 2010, I think that’s definitely up for debate and likely in regards to whether you prefer dub anime voice actors or not, but I am by no means crazy for finding the voice acting to just be okay. “Okay” isn’t bad.
                You're fine to have your opinions. But by and large the voice acting in OG Nier is considered to be phenomenal and its voice cast is stacked as fuck by today's standards. Like you really gonna say a game with Jameson Price and Laura Bailey as the main cast has bad voice acting?

Again you're welcome to have your opinion, but recognize that a majority of people disagree with your opinion and future success of the voice actors points to them being talented. Not saying you're wrong, just saying most people would think you're wrong.
                    Considering how poorly the first game sold and reviewed, I don’t think it’s crazy find the voice acting as just okay. Again, I never said it was bad. Not once. “Okay” does not equal “Bad”. It just means “Okay”. Those two people don’t suddenly make the voice acting anymore fantastic. Again, they’re just anime voice actors and they aren’t bad by any means, but aren’t exactly setting the world on fire with their performances in OG Nier either. Never said they weren’t talented. Never said they were bad. Just that the overall voice acting of the game is just okay and somewhat par the course for a lot of JRPGs of the time.  
  
Please, understand that I’m not saying the voice acting is bad by any means. I’m just saying it wasn’t top tier either and I think that is a completely fair assessment given the overall quality of the game.  
  
There is such an odd defensiveness of OG Nier as if it can’t be stated that the game has flaws. I love OG Nier. I personally find it fantastic, but there is a very clear reason why it wasn’t widely viewed as a big deal at launch. And that’s okay
                        Out of interest, what games would you consider to have top-tier voice acting, particularly from the same period? I thought Nier's was pretty great (Kaine and Weiss at least), but I haven't played a ton of games.
                        No. Didn't you hear them? You need to have their opinion because it's a popular one!!! Everyone would disagree! etc
                        > Again, they’re just anime voice actors

Anime voice actors is just a weird term to use, because tons of voice actors do tons of things. You're differentiating anime voice actors from...what? Voice actors who only do animated shows and movies? If you look at most big name voice actors in games, they probably have some anime on their backlog. In fact, a ton probably do. 

Take The Last of Us, which is probably the furthest you could get from anime, plenty of the main voice actors there have done plenty of anime. Troy Baker voices Joel but did anime for like 10 years before he even got the part. Laura Bailey voices Abby in TLoU2 and has also done a ton of anime, in addition to being Kaine. But they didn't just do anime, they were doing a wide variety of other video games too: western games and Japanese games both. 

That's not to say you can't have your opinion or that it's invalid, I just don't think "anime voice actors" is even really all that useful a distinction. Almost all working video game VAs, including the ones in Nier, do a mix of anime, American cartoons, Western video games, and Japanese video games.
        > And the story, atleast intro-wise, was just kind of standard,

If you don't finish a game, you shouldn't review it

/edit suggesting Professional paid critics should finish a game before reviewing it is controversial? The fuck is this subs sometimes?
            If you state you didn't finish the game and exactly why I think a review is totally fine. You might miss out on part of what makes a game something special but then the reader and either write it off altogether or seek out another review to decide if it's worth it. 

Especially with a game like Nier - it finishes stronger than it starts narratively but vastly worse gameplay-wise, and if nothing up front in the first ten or so hours catches someone's interest enough to put up with its worse aspects, it's unlikely anything in the last ten hours will make up for that.
                > If you state you didn't finish the game and exactly why

Isn't Nier the game where the [reviewer gave up after the game told him to catch a fish and didn't explain that no, you needed the fish from over THERE](https://www.engadget.com/2010-05-03-nier-review-fail.html).
                    yup yup. the part my guy Juice there leaves out is that the instructions for how to fish in the game are also incorrect, so a reviewer would just have to fuck around until it worked before they even get around to figuring out there's somewhere else to fish.
                And it's not like a game can't do it better while delivering the same themes. Nier Automata proves that decisively. Enjoyable gaming experience right from the get-go, and narratively engaging at the start. Of course, it's really in ending C-E where it reaches its amazing apex, but even without those endings, it would still be a quality experience.
            Even if you finish the whole game, it's valid to critique how long the game takes to get good. Most people aren't going to go through hours of mediocre gameplay and basic story just to get to the good part.
            I disagree. Not wanting to completely finish a game is a valid reaction, after all.

Let's take it to the logical extreme: imagine how warped the reviews would be if BotW only got reviewed by people who gathered all 900 Korok seeds. It would basically filter out everyone except the most hardcore players who just so happened to be most compatible with that particular game!

Games *can* be experienced without achieving some arbitrary measure of completeness. Reviews should reflect that basic truth. If a reviewer couldn't stomach finishing a game, *you bet* that I would want to know that. I want a review that actually represents the reviewer's individual experience with the game, not a fruitless attempt at assigning something as nebulous as artistic value or intrinsic worth.
            I don't think it applies with this game.

I love NieR:A. One of my favorite games of all time.

That said. I wouldn't recommend it to most people. The beginning of the game drags way too long and is the worst aspect of the game IMO.

The game doesn't really pick up story-wise till after you 'beat the game' once.

I dropped the game once before getting to the parts I really liked.

Guess my point is I think its totally valid for someone to burn out on one of these games before completing it especially because they quite literally demand you to replay the game over again before really seeing significant progress in the story.
            Right, but the game doesn’t start to truly standout until it’s latter half. Even for as good as the endings and really last half of the story is, the intro is still pretty standard and wasn’t exactly enticing a wide range of people at the time. You have to play the first half to get to the fantastic last half story, but if it’s a bit of a slog to get there, that’s going to affect the overall opinion of the game. The endings of the game, for as great as they are, didn’t make up for the rest of the game that was already rather lackluster for its time.  
  
And I say this as someone who loves original Nier
            Why? I don't have to finish a bad meal to know I'm not going to enjoy it. If a movie isn't grabbing me an hour in I'm not gonna lose sleep over giving it 1 star on Letterboxd. Why should I have to play every single minute of a video game before being able to leave a review?
                You shouldn't ever have to play through the entire game for a review, just as long as you let the reader know you didn't finish it in the article. That way, they can make an informed decision about whether the review is useful or not.
            I wonder how many reviewers even knew how to get the true ending. All weapons is somewhat of a chore, even if NG+ runs are quick.
                Getting all the weapons isnt too bad and it isnt like Drakengard where you have to max them all out
                    >Getting all the weapons isnt too bad 

That's quite a understatement, heh. You could miss out on some of them in first half of game without a guide and after halfway point, you were pretty much softlocked unless you chose to restart over all way from the beginning.
                        There are no missable weapons in Nier. You can get every single weapon at the very end of the game.
                            Weird, I recalled just giving up after reading some guide mentioning I missed some quests with weapon rewards.
                                Nope, there is only 1 weapon that you can "miss" by not doing a sidequest and that weapon can be bought at a shop for a period of time after the "timeskip". So if you miss it on your first playthrough, when you start at the midway point during your second you can go buy it.
    Or maybe the story only propped up the game so much for them? There's no need to be all high-and-mighty just because you liked the game a lot.
    I thought Automata was boring, ugly and extremely overrated. Would I enjoy Replicant? I'm assuming no.
Yea, hearing about OG Nier after playing automata, I’m really surprised by these scores. It was a day one buy for me just based on the themes but I’m really excited that the game itself has been improved upon.
Absolutely, a lot of remakes seem to suffer in reviews for simply being a good remake of an outdated game - I half expected this would have been one of them and I likely still would have been happy. I'm glad to see it doing better in reviews than I anticipated.
Soooo, is this the first game, and Automata is the second? I've never played them but I'm kinda curious. Wondering where to jump in.
    The connecting story is intentionally surreal and hard to follow, you won't really *get* how the two are connected until you play both (in addition to digesting some amount of side-content). There's over 9000 years between the events of Nier and Automata, so they're hardly directly sequels!

All of that's to say that you can play either first without hurting the "intended" experience. Anything that *could* be spoiled is only sort of *knowingly hinted at* in such a way that's only obvious to the player in hindsight, after playing both games.
    Yeah, they’re not super duper linked but playing this followed by Automata seems like a good idea.
    Well technically Nier is a sequel to Drakengard's (kind of) joke ending which is, of course, a sequel to Drakengard 3. And there's some short stories dotted around, at least one stage play, maybe some manga, whatever Yoko Taro posts on twitter, not Drakengard 2... Honestly, I really think that Automata was probably the first to catch on quite like this because it's the first one that's not actively annoying to play. But by the sounds of it they've sorted out the gameplay issues in Replicant so you grab either that or Automata for a great standalone experience. 

They're not super closely linked and the time gap between the two is... a while, but there are a few links in Automata that gave me all the feels to discover, and I can definitely see a lot of Automata players having the same experience of discovery with the new Replicant

TL;DR: Both great, both work on their own and as a pair. Be shallow; if you want cute androids then go Automata first, if you want to be [yelled at by a glorious trash monster every time you boot up the game](https://youtu.be/OvyvQfn30uE) then Replicant's your best bet, they'll fuck you up either way
        Nier is just a spin-off to drakengard.
        > if you want to be yelled at by a glorious trash monster every time you boot up the game

Turns out I would very much like to get yelled at by a glorious trash monster, huh.
    It's the 4th!

Drakengard > Drakengard 1 > Drakengard 3 (released after Nier) > Nier > Automata

(I might have the canonical order of the drakengard games backwards too, it gets messy.)

They have interconnecting themes and some recurring characters, but you don't need to play them in order. While specific endings are canonical and lead on to the next game, it's more a shared universe sort of deal.

(Drakengard 2 was developed by another studio without Taro, and while it follows on from Drakengard 1, it otherwise exists outside the canon and also *isn't very good.*)
    Both games spoil elements of each other's plots. I would recommend playing OG Nier first because I think the plot revelations hit a little bit harder going that way, but either way you're gonna get spoiled on something from the other game so just go with whichever you want.
        And Replicant is "OG Nier" just updated?
            The more accurate/complicated answer is that there were two versions of OG NieR in Japan - NieR Replicant (PS3) and NieR Gestalt (Xbox 360).

NieR Replicant had a young protagonist (brother trying to save his sister); NieR Gestalt had an older protagonist (father trying to save his daughter). Other than that, they're the same game.

But Replicant didn't get localized in the West, only Gestalt did, and they dropped the subtitle since there was only one version - so the North American game "NieR" is NieR Gestalt, with the "father" protagonist (and it got released on PS3 as well in the West, unlike in Japan).

This game is an updated remaster of NieR Replicant, the version with the "brother" protagonist that we never got in the West.
I tried to get into the original Xbox 360 game but the bland gameplay and environments was just unbearable for me. However I did fall in love with the [Soundtrack](https://youtu.be/Gm-X7KBBacM). Definitely looking forward to playing an improved version ☺️
    Shadowlord from Nier is probably in my top 5 video game tracks of all time.
    Unfortunately the new arrangements are overall almost all downgrades from the originals. The one thing that didn't need any updating....
The gameplay has been reworked tho
I thought the gameplay and design of Automata were pretty underwhelming, but the game was still great because all the other elements were fantastic (pretty much everything you mentioned). This makes me *really* look forward to playing Replicant.
I don't think time diminishes good design and gameplay in general. Nier is an interesting case, because it had offbeat design choices from the beginning. But there are games decades old that have better design than some modern ones.
    No I completely agree. I didn’t mean it as new games have better design than old games, it’s just that Nier has some pretty damn weird design choices.

    I only played the last of us for the first time in september but I only remembered the ridiculous amount of bugs I encountered playing it when I read this comment lol. That ending was so good it went from "a pretty cool game" to one of my all time favourites.
        [deleted]
            I was on PS4 and I had loads of little bugs here and there, the Kind that makes you laugh rather than impacting it badly though. My personal favourite was my weapon getting stuck spinning around all over the place like Joel is a magician.
                Sorry but I don’t think this is common
    > Spec Ops, 

Re:railroading, I’d say that illustrates a key weakness of that game: its very topical commentary (c. 2012) and only having one chance to pull you in otherwise it fails.
Your experience with this games is making me excited about the experience. Nier: Automata is my all-time favorite game. Nothing has come close for me. Let's hope the original kicks it's ass. I'm buying this once I get off work.
    The gameplay and design should be worse but as someone who played Nier 1 before Automata I feel the story and music was much better on the original than the sequel(this is actually a common fan sentiment). That said this remake changes the music a lot so it might not have the same impact as the original.
> **Side note:** PC version seems to have some issues

Here we go again... I pre-ordered NieR: Automata on STEAM, this new one I will buy only in some sale.

I still have my copy from the PS3 which I did 100% so yeah... no rush here. Maybe I buy it after 4 years when they patch the problems the game had on release.

If they like to treat their customers outside Japan like this the only thing I can do is just wish the worst to Square-Enix.
    You wish the worst because the PC port is lacking?
        And will probably never be fixed if Automata is anything to go by.
            They're working on a patch for Automata right now. Unless you're aware of that and implying it'll never come out.
                Wow already? That was fast. Can't believe it only took them 4 years.
                Took them 4 years, you wanna wait 4 years for all their PC ports to potentially get fixed? 

While they're at it, maybe they should upgrade from ps2/3 era graphics fidelity.
                    You realize this is a remaster of a ps3 game from 2010 right? Maybe you should look up a graphics comparison video if you think it’s ps3 era.
        If they dont want us to play their game is their problem, i pass buying games that devs didn't gave a single fuck to make the pc version at least working...
        Not OP, but you’ll find that sentiment to be common among the pc gaming community.

There’s already more good games coming out than most people have time to play, no point spending that time playing games or supporting devs that have poor pc ports. Japanese developers need to get with the times and recognize that it’s a growing platform with millions of people and start caring more about bringing proper ports to the platform
        I feel like this is par for the course for online gaming discourse, I understand people are disappointed and unhappy with SE but people need to have some perspective.
    Sure buy it 4 years later
After Automata's success made Yoko Taro games more mainstream, it's not a surprise this one is being reviewed in a more "alternative" way, considering the weirdness the game is built on.
    Can't wait for a modern remake of Drakengard.

That level of weirdness is going to melt people's brains. The music alone is on another level.

            >cum

Zero will violate you, both from and back, all in 60 FPS.
                I want to find that interview where Taro jokingly mentions the difficult frame was to make you feel bad about what was happening because how awful your character was. How hype is the idea that the game itself doesn’t want you to commit game crimes so it’s actively trying to prevent you from going forward. It’s a joke and not reality, but such a funny idea. My favorite are games that when making a choice ask you if you are sure, but then a second window appears right after to go “but, are you really sure?”.
[deleted]
    Even Cyberpunk had the odd naysayer. I suspect the reviews are all aware of how the original game had some really boring systems so there's not much else to say there.
If you go back and read Automata’s reviews, a lot of them read like 10/10s and have an 8 next to them. Maybe a tax for AA visuals? The OST and art design more than makes up for the technical side in my book.
[deleted]
    To be fair automata was not much better I love that game but stopped doing side stuff pretty quickly.
        Ah the stories as a whole were pretty good in side-quests for Automata, but I can't argue that they were designed as basic fetch quests and some seemed interested in just wasting your time. 


IIRC side-quests in the first Nier were significantly worse. There are a few standout ones like the Lighthouse sidequest but by and large its just really one-note fetch quests with little story impact. I guess I just find the idea of androids/robots trying to learn what it means to be human and exploring that through side-quests to be a more natural and interesting conceit than just "me hungry get mutton thx".
        At this point I am sure they are just parodies of shitty sidequest in other jrpgs.
        Uhhh, there was a lot of quality content in the side quests that added a lot to the story. Off the top of my head, I remember one that involved Yorha's executioner models by going deeper into their back stories, and another that went into a whole philosophical concept. How are these bad side quests exactly?
    Holy shit, I played this game wayyyy back in the PS3 days, and your comment is the first time I heard I was supposed to play it three times. I missed out on so much shit wtf ahahahah no wonder I was always left a bit confused by the story
        Automata is the same way if you ever play that, don't stop at ending A!
    I mean, that was the original game. Great story, shit gameplay. Also the requirements to get the full story are a miserable grind. It was a game you'd honestly probably get more enjoyment out of watching a lets play maybe than actually playing through it. I was kind of hoping this version might fix some of these issues in some way, but I guess not?
Interestingly enough, these two reviews have a mutually exclusive take about Framerate - PCGames is saying it appears to cap at 60 and has no options. PCGamesN says the game breaks down if it is above 60FPS.

One of these two has to have a mistake in there and considering we are talking about PCGamesN which generally has, at best, a shoddy quality I am not sure I care much for their take.

Sucks though that PC again gets the short end...

Edit: Also interesting that the controller comes up with both but very differently as well. Its like someone only got bulletpoints as data and had to write a review resulting in a different interpretation.
    My assumption is that it caps at the monitor refresh rate and the PC Gamer reviewer had a 60Hz monitor and didn't realise this was the case
        My assumption is similar, although what I'm betting is that the one reviewer that had capped FPS played the game on fullscreen borderless (which caps the game's FPS to the monitor/desktop refresh rate without needing V-Sync), while the other played on "true" fullscreen.
    Digital Foundry will probably cover it.
        I adore Nier but I'll wait for their video (or someone's in-depth performance analysis) before I pick it up. Don't want to risk buying it only to find out that it has massive frame drops, frame pacing issues, or worse.
            Yep, Automata is one of my fav games (played on release on PS4) but playing it recently on steam it was a buggy mess, just refunded before the two hours, the game pass version is okay but I still had a crash and some drops below 60 unfortunately
            Automata was unplayable to me until I installed FAR.  FAR fixed everything but a really minor frame pacing issue in the open game world.  Played perfect in the actual "zones" though.
    >Sucks though that PC again gets the short end...

I, for one, am shocked that a company that never bothered to patch their previous game in spite of crippling technical issues and only announced they'd work on a patch when preorders for their new game were open would release said new game with crippling technical issues.
The main issue seem to be controller disconnecting after a stutter. Other issues are no options for vsync and framerate options from what I've read from both reviews. 

I hope Square atleast fixes this one.
    > The main issue seem to be controller disconnecting after a stutter.

There was a report saying they accidentally disconnected their controller during a session and that caused the stutter.

I think I've heard some are experiencing random controller disconnects, and apparently this might be AMD CPU issue. My USB headset will cut out every once in a while and apparently this is a common issue (though none of my controllers ever have). Supposedly getting a BIOS update fixes this.
What a surprise... Let me guess, they also won't fix the issues on this one just like Automata.
    They'll fix them you just have to wait for the next nier game.
    [removed]
        I dunno if 'they're fixing automata 4 years after it's initial release, with no patches in between' should be held up as an example that they will fix the game in a timely manner. Especially when the automata patch isn't even out yet. 


From these reviews it seems like Replicant might be less broken (I don't recall whether automata reviews emphasized how shoddy the pc port was), but that doesn't mean it'll get any more post launch attention.
        Don’t get your hopes up. They’ll most likely only put the Game Pass version on Steam, that barely fixes anything and call it a day.

If they can’t make a new release work, how could we expect them to fix the old one in any way.
            This, and any fix will break the current FAR mod which will require a mod update.
            Two different dev teams.   Maybe Square will let them patch Replicant where they wouldn't let Platinum, since Plat announced they were working on patches before their involvement ended.
That makes it 2 out of 2 times Nier on PC was flawed.

For fuck's sake, SquEnix.
Ugh, *come on*. Why do devs *still* tie shit to framerate for PC games? Just had to deal with this crap in Nioh 2 not too long ago as well, which had the exact same problem (bosses acting like they were on crack when the framerate was too high).

EDIT: Okay, I wasn't aware that this is a remaster, not a remake. Still sucks, but it's a bit more understandable. Still hope they fix it instead of leaving it to rot for years like Automata.
    You guys do realize that this is a remaster not a full blown remake which means its running mostly on year 2010 code of a low budget game that was never intended to be on anything other than consoles made by a now defunct company that probably had no idea that a decade from now the series will blow up and fans would want the OG game on modern platforms.

These kinds of issues were bound to happen.
        While this is fair in this particular case, a lot of other games still do this and it appears to be a side effect of "make game as fast as possible" not "make game with best practices and future proofing in mind".
    it's sadly not uncommon for remasters, but it still really sucks
    It’s easier to program, and swat bugs when the timing is fixed at the frame rate.
        It's not "easier to program".

Multipling your value by the frametime is the easiest shit there is, competent devs have been doing it since the late 90s.

There is NO excuse for not doing this nowadays (or 10 years ago for that matter).
        I get that, but I don't get why you would do that for PC when the framerate is going to be so variable. I don't imagine it makes no sense in every scenario, but for stuff like animation speed I just don't understand why you would do that for such a variable environment.
            Precisely because it is so variable. Removing the need to account for framerate differences removes a lot of variance you would need to account for. Especially when you design a game primarily for consoles, when porting to PC it simplifies a lot to just force the PC to act like a console.
I'll be buying the game on console then, I was waiting to find out if they was going to release another broken pc port.
    Just wait for actual pc port reviews.  Both the reviews that went into any detail whatsoever had completely different experiences that were contradictory.
    I just bought it on Series S. Was planning on getting PC but somewhat expected it was gonna get the stepchild treatment.

Absolutely can't wait to play it though.
        I think it's extremely unlikely that the PC version is worse than the Series S version (on a sufficiently fast PC).
            Any plans on patching this game for them? :D
            You're absolutely right. Decided to put the console to use though, feel like I'll enjoy the game more on the couch and take my time with it. Can't wait.
        Since you're on Xbox, you can [change your system's region to play the game right now.](https://old.reddit.com/r/nier/comments/mvhtvw/to_all_xbox_owners_changing_the_consoles_region/)

Another Ghost Trick enjoyer. There's dozens of us!
    There are two types of people: those that love Ghost Trick and those who have never heard of it. Unfortunately most people fall into the latter camp
        I felt like I knew basically all games that people geniunely feel are their "favourites", its cool to find one I absolutely do not fucking know about.
            Ghost Trick is also available on iOS if I remember correctly. I think that might be how I played it actually... wild, awesome story.
Ghost Trick hell yeah
i think you just sold a copy of this game by putting in the same sentence as Xenogears.  Im replaying xeno right now and i was just thinking how much more engaging the story is than most videogames these days.  Having never played the original Nier i guess i gotta check this out.
The first dungeon >!is clearly a dilapidated modern building!< so they weren’t *that* secretive about the game being >!post-post-apocalypse!<
To be fair, there were alot of "3rd Person Melee Action Adventure" games back then. So I don't find it too odd that Nier kinda fell to the wayside at the time.
I'd be surprised if any reviewers got ending b, c or d
That's because there are a *ton* of gameplay issues with the original Nier. Even criticizing reviewers for not getting the extra endings for replaying parts of the game falls flat because the game does almost nothing to make those replays tolerable.

I made my way through the original alongside my (at the time) roommate, and even knowing about the additional endings we both agreed that we couldn't stand to replay the game after getting the first ending because it simply wasn't enjoyable to play.
ACG stated that load times are like ~~~10s~~ 5-11s and that it’s locked @ 60fps

Edit: Double checked his video and fixed the times up. Still a tad long
    PS4 physical copy vs PS5 digital download doesn't make any difference in performance right?
        Nope!  Shouldn’t be any difference since PS4 physical should be backwards compatible on the PS5 - and there wasn’t any version tailored for the PS5 so it doesn’t matter for now
            Great news! I love collecting physical games and WalMart usually has games for about $10 cheaper + compatible with PS5. Win-win-win
The same composer did some NieR music that’s specific to the FF14 raid series. Even if you don’t intend to play, I recommend giving it a listen. 

Here’s [one of the tracks](https://youtu.be/jVAgd9dbYIs).
if you want to play Drakengard 3, play it on emulator with the 60 FPS mod, its alot better than the 1-10FPS you get on console in combat
I want to play that game so badly. Fingers crossed.
Shows how much community influences reviewers. If the first one would not have been a cult classic, this would've stayed at 5/10.

Reviewers are writing numbers that people **want** to see and occasionally substract a point or two. Best case in point: Cyberbug: San Andreas. Buggy, shallow, and not cyberpunk to the point that even the author of Neuromancer got on Twitter to mention that it seems like 70's retrofuturism and not cyberpunk.
    >If the first one would not have been a cult classic, this would've stayed at 5/10.

If the first one didn't become a cult classic this one wouldn't have even existed.
    [removed]
    I agree. I love the NieR franchise, but unless this remake makes some *significant* changes or improvements to the game I really don't see how it deserves a rating higher than 6/10.

(Spoilers) >!Seeing as you have to play through the game three times. It relies too heavily on a single plot twist. The majority of the background, lore, and exposition isn't even included in the actual game but in side novels. Ending D makes no sense other than for feels. The true ending E isn't even included in the game.!< Some of these issues could very well be fixed in the remake, but I don't have high hopes. Sure the original is a cult classic, but I feel it's gonna get scrutinized *heavily* when exposed to a wider audience - especially when people claim it's far better than Automata.
        The achievement list shows that >!Ending E is in the game. Don't know if it's the same one, but regardless there is an Ending E!<
            Oh hell yea, that's great to hear. >!Tbf I wouldn't mind even if it was just an adaptation of the one from the novels. I don't really know the nitty gritty of it besides a TL;DR, and it's been like 4 years since I even read *that*.!<
    Yea, that's apparently obvious, most reviews are just pandering for views to their respective audience and never really step on any toes.
Shows how bullshit game reviewers are. They dont say what they think, they say what you want to hear.
    I don't know. Part of appreciating art is meeting it halfway. When something is new and strange it can be hard to find the right frame to enjoy it. A more polished mainstream sequel can act as sort of a guide to teach you to notice and appreciate the qualities that were in its predecessor.

Plenty of people now love MGS2 who hated it upon release, myself included. These days we're more accepting of meta-narratives and intentional user-hostile design in 2021 than we were in 2001. Things that used to be alienating now seen as clever and subversive.

My opinion change doesn't mean I was previously disingenuous, it just means that years of life experience and art experience allow me a different perspective than my younger self.
    That would make sense if it were literally the same game, but they went back and fixed a lot of the issues reviewers at the time brought up.
        Quite a lot of  the reviews clearly disliked it for feeling dosjointed and a mishmash of multiple genres, then that became a staple and beloved feature with Automata.

True, the combat wasn't as great, and it was uglier, but I wouldn't say that makes it a 5/10, the characters were much more intriguing than Automatas IMO. It still had a stellar voice cast, an incredible story, great characters, a 10/10 soundtrack, deep and emotional sidestories, one of the most conpelling endings in videogame history, and all in all... the combat wasn't bad, just not a highlight and the progression was actually somewhat addicting... it was never such a poor game.

To be fair, I haven't seen all of the changes, but if a change of combat and a small graphical facelift brings a 5/10 to a 9 - 9.5 / 10, I think there's a lot more at play than simply fixing old issues.
    game reviews are opinions and opinions can and sometimes should change over time.
    I don't think so - playing a remastered cult classic is going to mean you give it a lot more leeway to impress you. A random game comes out that takes 10 hours to get to the good bit and has its own problems besides that? I think anyone would be less lenient with it. Like how if food smells good, it can make you hungrier and more inclined to enjoy it.

Multiple play throughs to see everything but after route A you restart at the halfway point for B and then after seeing all the new content there you can just skip cutscenes and just plow through in 3-4 hours each for C and D. Thats just going by the original game. I'm sure there will be some added stuff in this one though. And like others have said it's about 35-40 hours long.
    oh damn, so this game unfolds like Automata, multiple chapters for the full experience, that's awesome, I loved that about Automata.
        Yep, all the storytelling techniques people loved in Automata originated in this game.
There are multiple endings like Automata and the B Route is absolutely a mandatory part of the experience.
im torn since the game is way cheaper on pc for me, and my ps4 its gathering dust until i can get a ps5, hope the bugs are not that big so i can finish the game in peace
    Isn't it a full priced game on steam? does it cost more on consoles?
        oh i dont know about other countries, but im from argentina, and steam regionalizes prices so it isnt as expensive as a playstation game that you have to pay in dollas plus taxes and shit, sucks but thats the way it is
            Damn, Poland is still $60 on Steam so I've decided to wait for a sale :/
        isthereanydeal.com
    It appears to be 4k/60 on PSPro/PS5 (and the OneX/Series X). Console will probably be the best place unless some fixes PC with a patch or mod.
        Can't wait for Kaldaien to give us the DRM infused mod we really deserve.
        Really, someone else said it was 900p on series x.
Square Enix: what if it's worse than dogshit?
    The square root of 1.5 dogshits?
Well not too many games with MC scores in the 60s get remakes. This definitely not possible without the success of Automata.
    
>Well not too many games with MC scores in the 60s get remakes

Which is stupid. The best games to remake would be ones that did something interesting and unique but didn't manage to pull off the execution as well as they should/could have.

For the record, yes I'm aware the reason is money.
The original metacritic score was dogshit to begin with. Such a misreviewed title
    Nier Gestalt is one of my absolute favourite games, so subjectively I completely agree with you. But if I look at the game from a slightly more objective perspective...I have to say it just wasn't a great game. Clunky as hell, gameplay was very rough, side-quests tedious, etc. So I get low scores for the original, even though I would personally rate it much higher.
        If games are works of art, an S-Tier story, characters and OST should elevate a C-tier game to a B score.
    No it wasn't.
Hype does that sometimes
If you didn't like Automata, this won't change your mind on the series I feel. Like Kojima, Yoko Taro does some Yoko Taro-ass games.
    Don't get me wrong I liked Automata, but I felt it was overhyped and heralded as this "Best Game Ever" whereas I played it, enjoyed it and had fun, but not the best game I've ever played, a solid 7 or 8 /10
        Automata is easily my 2nd favourite game of all time, only behind FFX
            ffx fans !
                FFX is also one of my two favorite games of all time. Love that game.
I think the main knock against the original is that the gameplay was really not good. I think an ~82 OpenCritic score is roughly appropriate for a game with improved but often tedious gameplay, but with an amazing story/music/characters etc.
I 100% agree. I loved Automata, it was possibly one of my favourite games of all time but I cannot get into this even after playing for over 10 hours so far. The difference between Replicant and Automata is night and day, it feels and looks extremely dated which I could probably forgive if the gameplay also wasn't lacking.

I'll probably keep playing, but I somewhat regret paying full price for it.
    I loved automata (my first exposure to nier) enough to get all 26 endings and Emil pillow merch. About 20 hours into Replicant and I’m considering just watching the cutscenes on YouTube. This game feels terrible to play. I’ve even decided to hold off on side quests in the second half because I can get them on a later play through but even just doing the story is such a chore.
God damn I feel the exact same.  I just finished the first route and even the big reveals they try to do there are like "yeah thanks I figured that out like 8 hours ago thanks".  And I keep hearing people say what a "great character" kaine is but she's literally just "swears a lot, but is nice sometimes".

I KNOW it's going to get more interesting with the subsequent playthroughs, but God damn I'm not sure I'll be able to fully forgive what a slog this has been so far. If you haven't already, I highly recommend putting it on easy and just being through it...

Unfortunately I felt the same. Love automata, struggled with this game. 

I was really struggling around this mark as well. It picks up at around 8/10 hours in but then just gets really boring again once you realise you're just doing the same stuff again. 

The story and plot and characters where so engaging in Automata and I was so excited when people said they were even better in Replicant. I could have forgiven the combat for an amazing tale but damn. I honestly couldn't care less by the end. I connected to no one which just made it all worse. 

My first set of credits rolled around and I thought... Do I really want to play this again? (knowing it was another replay and not a different story or even perspective) annnnnnd I thought no. I might be missing out but I'd rather just read what happens on the toilet and forget about it straight after than put myself through it again in all honesty.
    Oh the perspective changes all right. You do you, but I'd go so far to say if you didn't play the B route you didn't experience Nier.
        I'm okay with that, I completely, completely cknowledge I didn't finish it in the slightest. It was just the line in the sand for me, and considering I didn't do all the side quests in the first half I also knew I wouldn't be able to get all the endings. 

Playing to "find out more" Also just wasn't an incentive because I didn't really care about the characters or the story. I did end up reading the developments and watching clips though. :) 

I think for me a great, well told story is like the amazing tasty cherry on a great game but the game play needs to come first. If I'm not enjoying the game I'll just play another game and listen to a lore/story telling video on it on YouTube. 

I have now just started a replay of Auto from the start though and seeing Emil and certain details like the dessert robotsmasks that I had forgot about are awesome. So some genuine joy came out of it.
            > I have now just started a replay of Auto from the start though and seeing Emil and certain details like the dessert robotsmasks that I had forgot about are awesome. So some genuine joy came out of it.

Glad it retroactively worked out for you in that sense in enhanced your Nier: A experience. You may appreciate this trove of information at this stage: >![The Ark](https://theark.wiki/w/Welcome).!<
  
 
> and considering I didn't do all the side quests in the first half I also knew I wouldn't be able to get all the endings. 

Just a heads up in case you come back one day you don't need to do all the side quests, just collect all the weapons (though some Part 2 SQs do give weapons). Any weapons missed in Part 1 can be bought in Part 2 from the shops, so you also don't need to sweat that aspect of it.
    Damn.  I feel bamboozled honestly, I really put in trust with people saying that it gets better after 10 hours, really the only reason I didn't return it after I played for 2 hours... Now it's too late.
        Yeah... It's such a shame. I get that it's a remake/remaster of an old game but in that case slapping the £50 price tag on it was a bold move.
I’m in the same boat. I absolutely loved everything about automata and it’s probably one of my top 10 favorite video games. I’m over halfway through this game and it honestly feels like a choir 90% of the time. I’m really trying to enjoy it but everything about it feels dated. The story is decent but it doesn’t seem to be enough. Maybe I’ll change my mind once I finish but so far I’m really not impressed.
People got burned extremely badly by Automata. One of the best games of its generation and it was hard crashing my PC.
Yeah the issues are really minor lol, they're minor annoyances at the most. They overlooked 144hz+ monitors and owners (such as myself) will have to cap it manually and theres stuttering caused by controller disconnects but thats basically it lol. If that was all Automata had wrong with it I'd have played it on PC for framerate stability and resolution.  


I guess people are still pissed over Automatas recent drama.

It’s the square root of 1.5, which is what the creator thinks of this game.  In between a remaster and a remake. (Which is still an insane Kingdom hearts level name but... at least it makes somewhat sense lmfao).
    oh my god hahahahaha !!! Thank you both for the info
        He's also quoted as stating:

*"Incidentally, the big string of numbers on the end of the title was just something I stuck on randomly, so I wouldn’t think too hard about it if I was you."*

Gotta love the honesty.
        Hes doing it as a joke/parody of Kingdom Hearts' shitty numbering system. If youve never played a YokoTaro game, they are all full of gags and parodies of other shit
The reason the name has 1.2247448 (square root of 1.5) at the end is Taro believes it is halfway between remake and remaster so its both at the same time.
    well that makes more sense than the various Kingdom hearts names, so that's nice at least.
        Imo it still falls in the Kingdom Hearts territory. It is needlessly complicated and when showed off on a website makes it seem like the listing is broken if you don't already know the game's name
            pretty sure Yoko Taro did that on purpose. he's an edgy guy and it's funny. most people will call it the Nier Replicant remake/remaster and it won't be confusing
                Nier Replicant alone sorta works too since the old one is called Gestalt, and to casual fans this is just a brand new prequel anyway.
            [deleted]
                We're talking about game titles here, not the story
        No it doesn't? The KH names make much more sense than that.
        what? every single KH name makes sense and has a meaning. this narrative about KH being overly complicated is so overblown at this point
            Look I'll be the first to defend the plot of KH as not being all that complicated, but names like " Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover", "Kingdom Hearts 0.2: Birth by Sleep – A Fragmentary Passage", and "Kingdom Hearts Unchained χ/Kingdom Hearts Union χ[Cross]/Kingdom Hearts Union χ Dark Road" are just nonsense.
    Not according to [this interview](https://square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/nier-replicant-dev-message?utm_campaign=devmessage_photo_SQEXSOCIAL). Seems like he considers it a "version upgrade". Then he goes on to say

>Incidentally, the big string of numbers on the end of the title was just something I stuck on randomly, so I wouldn’t think too hard about it if I was you.
What? This is absolutely NOT a remake. The creator specifically refused to call it one because its not. Its still very clearly running on mostly old code thats why the PC port has all these weird issues.
    All the assets have been remade. They aren't simply using upscaled textures like a remaster would. Maybe the underlying code is the same, but that's pretty standard for remakes so it keeps the same feel.
        Yeah, pretty sure i heard the combat was redone from scratch too.
    That's like saying Demon's Souls PS5 isn't a remake because it too uses old code.
    I love Yoko Taro and his works, but he is very much an eccentric artist. One should try to take comments from such artists regarding their own work with a grain of salt and not as gospel.
        Yes Taro is eccentric but that doesnt mean he lies about shit. He is always very open on development problems that his team run into and budget constraints that he has had to work with. 

Him saying this not a real remake is very much a serious comment made to make sure than fan expectations are grounded. 

Him calling it ver1.22474487139... is him being eccentric and having fun with it.

They are two different aspects of the same person.
            I'm not saying he's lying. I'm saying his perceptions of his own work can be skewed, and that can affect the way he assesses them. In particular, I've picked up on some higher levels of humility and self-doubt when he discusses his work, which could absolutely affect this exact scenario.
                I get what you are trying to say. Taro loves self depreciating. But the "this is not a full remake" is not one of those. It's not just Taro the entire team stated that as a very matter of fact thing. 

As someone who 100% OG NieR, I can tell you this is the same game. They have very clearly shown the part they remade like the core combat and what parts they left exactly the same. Like the environments and stuff. Most of the environment assets arent even remade just upscaled and further polished and the team confirmed that. If people are going in expecting a brand new experience, this is not it. It's gonna feel slightly dated because at its core it is still a low budget ps3 jrpg.
    he also tried to claim that Nier's name isn't Nier so are we really taking his word on this kind of thing?
Taro literally says it's not a remake nor remaster, but a 'Version Upgrade'.
This is not a remake at all, this is still built on top of the original game including several flaws
    Remake:

* Uses completely brand new assets
* Runs on a completely different, modernized engine that may be similar to the original game engine
* Was built from a brand new codebase
* Retains the original story/concept
* Examples: MGS1 on Gamecube, Demon Souls, RE1/2/3, Link's Awakening, Gen 1-4 Pokemon remakes, FF3/4 on DS

Remaster:

* Uses updated assets (graphical and/or audio)
* Runs on the same engine with possible QOL fixes
* Shares much of the same exact code as the original
* Has the exact same story
* In some cases, a console "remaster" is not much different than a PC game running at higher graphics settings
* Examples: Pretty much every PS3 game released on PS4

Or a TL;DR: If the game looks like someone just turned up their graphics settings, it's a remaster. This game is clearly a remaster.

    I've only glanced the PC reviews but it doesn't seem to be "broken." There is a 60fps cap and there are apparently some controller issues on PC, seems very playable but I haven't experienced it myself.
        Also, Nier Automata itself was not broken. It wasn't a good port but it worked. I played it on PC and finished all the main endings. That guy is being dramatic.
            > It wasn't a good port but it worked

For some people.  I bought it on release and never got it working properly on my 770 even with the FAR mod, and I heard similar stories for other people with 700 series cards.  Reinstalled it later when I got a 1080 and it ran fine.
                Yeah it specifically hated the architecture that the 700 and 960 and below ran on.
            I would call crashing every 30 min is broken.
            [deleted]
                These issues only popped up for some people, through multiple systems I've had zero issues other than the framerate which isn't something I completely care about.  
Game never crashed, never had any issue with resolution, had online on for the entire game and multiple playthroughs without issue and this was all at launch with a pc that was pretty standard at the time (i5 4690k, 290x, 16GB DDR3) and still now with a much beefier pc I've had zero issues with the PC version (i9 9900k, 64GB DDR4, RTX 3090)
                Can't say I noticed or experienced all of those. Framerate issues yes. I don't really have a good eye for resolution so if it was the case it didn't bother me. Don't recall getting a CTD but I might be misremembering. Also my rig would have been pretty beefy at the time so might have factored in.

I would never consider watching someone else play a game as a replacement for me playing it. Different strokes, I guess.
                    That's all fine, but yeah, Automata was *rough* on release.

I personally dealt with the Resolution issues, Lighting Issues/Artifacts, CTD's, and other things.  Still, I loved the game.
        People have to cap themselves at 60fps. It is not like the game provided an option to cap framerate or tell people to do it.
    I mean youre only robbing yourself of a great experience in favor of a shallow, vicarious experience but you do you I guess...
[deleted]
    It did come out a bit diplomatic, huh? I just thought the polarised comments and review scores were interesting, and I hope that changes over time 🙂
    No happy. Only complains allowed.
    And your reads like it's from a bot. 

In fact, I'm not convinced it isn't.
Of course the comments here are so critical. NieR:Automata took several years and a gigantic shit storm to **announce** an update, and the last big release - Cyberbug 2077 - had reviewers lying through their teeth because they were afraid of saying something against daddy publisher. 

Each and every single one of the scores above is meaningless, I'll wait for opinions on Reddit.
    And even these lying reviewers gave Cyberbug and AC Valhalla best reviews than this game on Metacritic lol. I’m not paying 60 bucks for an old game with a below 85 Metacritic score.
Agreed. I played NieR about 6 months after Automata and think I might like it better than Automata. It definitely has a lot of parts that are mediocre/bad, but the creativity and boldness of everything really shines through. And it's fun to see the more rough around the edges ideas that were attempted here and then perfected in Automata (the bullet hell, some of the non-3rd person segments). 

I'm so excited to see what this new version is like.
I dunno.... I loved automata so, so, so much but this game is kinda just grinding on me... Slogged the first 10hours, it picked up a bit after that and then just got so dull again.... 
I've finished my first run through but I'm really struggling to find the motivation to play again...everything revealed so far was kinda predictable and I do love GW but having him sarcastically point out the game flaws I was thinking in my head did not make it charming.... Being self aware that youre doing nothing but run from point A to point B or that there's nothing original about your bosses doesn't make it any better. Kaine as a character makes me want to vomit out of my eyes and God the combat is so easy and so God damn boring! 

I'm tempted to just play the  soundtrack on loop and leave it at that! 

I totally recognise I'm in the minority, it's just not a guaranteed love
Yea new games and game design choices are put on such a pedestal and treated as automatically objectively better than anything older than like 7 years lol. It's so absurd.
    It’s the kind of mindset in the industry that convinces people that a full remake of the last of us is a good idea. I’m not a big fan of it but even I can admit that the game has aged phenomenally.
Would be nice if they reduced the grind needed for all endings a bit
Oh yeah, I forgot why I never went for all the endings until you mentioned it.
The additional ending was something cut from the original game that was not intended require additional grinding.

Frankly, I'm surprised that you didn't get the last ending. Its very easy to grind money in that game if you exploit the farming mechanic. Nothing like Drakengard.
Yes, you need to play multiple times.  Your second (and third, and fourth) playthroughs start you off at the halfway point with all your gear and stats intact.  Since you know where you’re going and are much stronger than the enemies it’s probably only a few hours to finish each additional playthrough.
Unlike Automata, you do actually have to play through the game multiple times to get the full story. Subsequent runs can go pretty quick since you can mostly just run past every enemy.
    How is that unlike Automata?
        In Automata the B and C runs are a good bit different from the initial A playthrough, but I understand the concept is the same and a lot of B run is similar to A. 

C on the other hand is a whole new playthrough in Automata.
        You don't replay through the same game again in Automata. Route C picks up from where route A&B left off. It's entirely new. And only about half of route B is a replay of route A.

In Replicant, you replay through the entire game each time. There are of course some minor differences, but the only one I remember is an extra cut scene near the end.
Did you play Automata? You didn’t really play through the game multiple times, each path was a pretty different experience.
    You play the game twice, and then you get an additional chapter. But you do play it twice.
    You did though. Route B was almost a carbon copy of A story wise with some minor differences and from a different perspective(since you play as 9S.)

It's actually one of my biggest criticisms of the game. A+B could have been more organically condensed into one playthrough with C as the finale. I really can't blame people for not wanting to play the whole game again just to get to the actual good part in route C.

Thankfully if you ignore sidequests it's pretty quick to blitz through B, but you still shouldn't need to do that.
        That's my biggest gripe of the game. I never played B or C but I heard C and beyond is amazing. I didn't even enjoy route A that much so I was never compelled to play B. Feels very tedious imo.
    I did. I quit halfway through the second part. It didn't feel different enough to make it an enjoyable experience for me.

So I was curious if this game does the same thing. Because if it does, it's probably not my jam.
        It does.
        Oh trust me it turns into a whole other game shortly after where you stopped.
            That's what I've heard but I was too burned out to push through. I'm glad so many people love it but it just isn't my type of game.
    100% agree with this, I was very confused with Automata because all the reviews said you needed to beat the game multiple times to get to the true ending, when I got the true ending I thought damn, I'm going to need to do all the again!  And then I realized that people thought that 9s's part was having to play the game "again" which it isn't.  The different character perspective is the other half of part 1's story, and then part 1 and part 2 converge to push us into part 3.  Not once did I feel like I was playing the game again.  saying you have to beat the game multiple times is a massive disservice to the game, the game is told in episodes and each episode completes the experience, you can't just beat episode 1 and call it a day.
This is something I don't get, I beat Automata, I got to the 17th and final chapter, it only took me one play through to get to the 17th chapter.  Why do people say you need to beat Automata multiple times?  You play as 2b in part 1, then you play as 9s in part 2, and then so on and so forth.  Every chapter pushes the story forward, 9s' segment is not another play through of 2b's, it's the story told from the other character which pushes the full experience forward in the next part, both converge to push the story forward.
    That's commonly called routes or playthroughs. Each character's set if levels is a route.

It isn't that complicated.
Buttery smooth performance throughout on my PS4 Slim. No worries there imo.
Automata had horrendous post-launch support on PC.  I would strongly lean toward console for that reason alone.
I get some of the other stuff but dude, if the game is tied to framerate then that's just it. It's not like it's stuck to 30 or something, 60 is absolutely acceptable.
worry not! a patch is only 5 years away!
    > worry not! *the promise of* a patch is only 5 years away!

FTFY. Call me a cynic but I'll believe they're patching Automata when I see it, and I'm half expecting the patch to cause new issues even if they do.
> Capped at 60fps by default
> 
> Some stuff is tied to framerate and boss fights are much harder when played above 60fps

erm, how those two things are possible at the same time?

edit

probably game defaults to monitor refresh rate
    Many games allow usersetting file edits to uncap frame rates. Some people do this and find out it breaks the game if physics are tied to frame rate. Not sure if it applies here but that's the scenario where both could apply.
    Uncapping the frame rate with 3rd party software.

        [removed]
What does no FPS limit and capped at 60 FPS mean? Aren't those contradicting each other?
    They mean a custom fps limit, in case someone wants to cap it to a value below 60.

Edit: I have read that this info is wrong and the game doesn't actually have an fps cap option, despite behaving strangely at any framerate higher than 60.
    The game is capped at 60fps by default, but you can't set any other framerate limits within the game. There is no option for it.
        But then:

> Some stuff is tied to framerate and boss fights are much harder when played above 60fps

If there's a FPS cap of 60 how is the quoted text happening?
        What other framerate limit would you set? A limit of 120 would clearly be unnecessary since it's already capped at 60.
> Man, I'm getting sick of Japanese developers and their PC ports. If you don't care, at least outsource it to a studio that knows how to do basic PC features.

If anything we've been getting some very very good PC ports from japanese companies lately with all the atlus and squenix rpgs on steam.
These aren’t really that big of a deal tbh. I’ll be picking up the game if there’s nothing major like Automata’s port.
>No fps limiting option

>Capped at 60fps by default

How can it be both at the same by time?
I'll be honest, all of those things you listed are important to me. But if you won't even consider a game without them, you're missing out like crazy.
> * No Vsync

Ahh thats fine, ive got a freesync monitor.

> * No fps limiting option

No biggie, itll run a little hot and the frame pacing wont be perfect. I can live with it.

> * Capped at 60fps by default

Okay, a little INI tinkering maybe but this isnt the wor...

> * Some stuff is tied to framerate and boss fights are much harder when played above 60fps

Oh god please, why havent these companies learned from the original Dark Souls 1 PC release? Or DS2 before Scholars for that matter.

> * Stuttering when using a controller

*sigh* hopefully fixable at least?

> * Randomly disconnecting controller

Just fucking end my life. a $3 game made by 1 dude that takes 2 hours to complete can find a way to integrate xbox controller support or use the steam api and work flawlessly. This shit is just laziness. At some point, just dont do a PC release. if youre going to give me a middle finger, put some pizazz on it.
    >Oh god please, why havent these companies learned from the original Dark Souls 1 PC release? Or DS2 before Scholars for that matter.

You.. You know this game before darksouls 1 right? And that you can't just magically change the game engine from connecting logic to framerate?
        > You.. You know this game before darksouls 1 right?

Well this game comes out tomorrow, in 2021. Its a remake, with substantial changes, one of them should have been this frame rate nonsense.

> And that you can't just magically change the game engine from connecting logic to framerate?

Then explain what happened with dark souls 2, where the base game had this issue and others, then the DLC came out and they fixed it? Shit, even emulators running BoTW on PC have unlinked framerates and engine features like speed for the sake of fidelity, and they didnt even develop the game.
        This is remake and not original old game. Improvements like higher framerate should be expected not excused. If they want to charge $60+ for PC port then put some effort into it.
idk, combat looks alot more fun than it did on PS3
I mean, the combat, graphics and performance where the main reasons it got bad reviews while this is all new assets, a new combat system and solid performance.
Or youtube in general. I have recently been listening to Nier Automata OST at work, and youtube started recommending me videos that contain spoilers in thumbnails and in their titles.
    Listened to the soundtrack today and the first recommended video was a video about the endings with spoilers in the thumbnail. So damn frustrating.
[deleted]
    Problem is the amount of recommendations and Stream titles with major spoilers, and auto run streams in guide websites like Fextralife.

Also thats why i said i was going to avoid major streamers so i dont spoil the game. :)
    > Huh? They're not spoiling anything. If you go to someone's stream when they're playing a game you're spoiling it for yourself.

Meanwhile if you go on Youtube after so much as even thinking of clicking on a trailer 5 years ago, you can expect videos with Thumbnails and/or Titles showing major plot/ending events showing up in your recommended feed for the next month or so.
Replicant. Automata is the sequel.
Remake then Automata. People will tell you that you can skip the original but that's just completely wrong. The entire premise of Automata spoils the original NieR.
I played Automata first and I didn’t feel too lost, but this remake is the original so if you want to go chronological then play the remake first.
I would go with Replicant, the gameplay is a bit more modern in Automata, even if they tried to modernise Replicant a little bit. The jump will be kinda jarring i feel if you go Automata then Replicant.
Automata spoils this game, so play this first
it... doesn't really matter. They're both pretty standalone.

That being said, playing Replicant first will give you more context for like two things in Automata while Automata won't give you any additional context for Replicant (...probably) so if all else is equal, play Replicant first.
The biggest problems with the original were the controls and gameplay, all of which were very clunky. Those seem to be both addressed in this version, plus updated graphics, more content, and re-recorded audio. So plenty of opportunity to improve the scores.
    The "awfulness" of the controls in the original were absurdly overblown.
        As someone who just played through the original and finished it yesterday, agreed.  People just wanted another God of War, probly.
Look at Cyberpunk. Reviewers just say what they think people want to hear.
    Absolutely right. Reviewers willingly ignored a *lot* with that, up to and including how they weren't offered the console versions, to comply with the NDA. Let's not forget it was floating in the 90s on the day the embargo lifted.
I doubt the PS5 will play it *worse* than playing it on PS4, but there are no enhancements outside of innate things like slightly faster loading - it’s still stuck at 1080p, for instance.
You mean the PS4 version? As of now, there's no Series X or PS5 patch that's been announced.
Two entirely different companies made Automata and Replicant
Automata is that kind of game that lives on its quirkyness, unexpected twists and turns and plot. If that doesn't sounds interesting it's likely to bore the hell out of you. 

I'm satisfied I stuck with it but I wanted to break the disc during the second route because the hacking minigame was an irritation.

I suppose Replicant is very similar.
    Well, if they make another of these games, perhaps they should inject some of that quirkiness a little earlier.
        It's a long setup to subvert player's expectations. It works sometimes, but it really expects you to hold on and wait for weird stuff to happen.

The third playthrough of Automata's is absolutely brilliant and the highest point of the game, but even then it takes some two or three awful hours to go through and during that time you also have to deal with some of the worst things in the game, and that's after you already sunk a lot of time in the first two playthroughs (The second being legendarily bad, in my honest opinion). It's really frustrating, but it's a game for people who really want to experience things that are not in any other games.

Hell, one of my favorite games is Pathologic and that game is a misery simulator, so I do know the feeling. If you really aren't into in that postmodernist payoff - which, to be honest, might just not be your thing. FF7R was *not* my thing. Dark Souls is *not* my thing. Persona 5 just *isn't* my thing. I'm not trying to make you look like *you just don't get it* - this probably isn't very interesting.

If anything, the real value of the game (I found the plot fairly mundane) is its experimental nature, and games like these are few and far between, hence why fans hold these in high praises.

Personally I like weird games and imaginative monsters design and that seems to be hiding somewhere in this game. It's not really all that deep for me.

I could kinda see a glimmer of that in the game. For example, I accidentally triggered Ending 'K' by eating the fish in the desert, and that was odd but funny, and I liked that. So I know what you mean, and I appreciate things like that too. I'm not adverse to experimental games myself, I freaking love Death Stranding for example and it seemed like a lot of gamers didn't care for that one. I like trying new things, but Automata just didn't click for me personally. Like you said, it's a long setup to wait for the good stuff, and while I am a patient person I simply have less interest in it after slogging through the first playthrough.

> FF7R was not my thing. Dark Souls is not my thing. Persona 5 just isn't my thing.

I am currently playing the original FF7 before I try the remake, but I liked the demo. I have not played any of the Persona games, but they have piqued my interest. Dark Souls however I am a *huge* fan of, so maybe that says something about me as a gamer.
If you didn't enjoy Automata why would you even consider that you might enjoy Replicant? I thought Automata was a master piece lol.
    Because there's *something* underneath the aspects I didn't like that's inspired and good. If they made the rest of the game a little more interesting where it counted, it could've changed my opinion of it tremendously. So a complete remake of the first game had potential to do that, but according to the reviews it's apparently quite similar to Automata in all the ways I didn't like. Even the GameSpot review gave it a 9/10 while calling it bad in some ways (my emphasis added):

> It's great that this game, which is a bit hard to get a hold of nowadays, has been faithfully recreated, faults and all. But you can't overlook how its dated aspects--even by 2010 standards--make for an antiquated experience. This means that, as a whole, **gameplay is more of a vehicle for Nier Replicant's story**, and the act of playing it puts some of its key narrative themes into important context.
>
> **This game tests your patience** but the payoff is immense. It's worth jumping through the necessary hoops in order to see every aspect of Nier Replicant's various conclusions. You just wouldn't get the full picture otherwise, and the full picture is wholly satisfying.
>
>"Endings" is a bit of a misnomer with regards to Nier. Subsequent playthroughs help recontextualize what you've seen before, offering additional crucial perspectives. This approach is valuable for the narrative style and messaging of Nier, as **it utilizes repetition** to communicate some affecting themes. Re-experiencing chunks of the game means the series of events are familiar, so the additional context captures your undivided attention, often leaving you questioning yourself or experiencing a revelation about a particular story beat you initially didn't think much of at first.
>
>Nier Replicant doesn't make you play the entire game over again, **but with a few obtuse requirements, it can wear you down, especially by the time you make it to the third route.** 

They don't make the game sound fun to me. Obviously there's something great underneath the unfun parts, and I wish I could experience that, so I was hoping they'd improve in that regard and apparently it is no different.

    2B was typical anime fan service for no real reason, it's just kinda gross.
        It wasn't for no reason, though. Doll-like clothing is sometimes used in anime art to convey an emotionless personality and/or someone abused by others as merely an object. The blindfold (and its eventual removal) is also very significant in the context of the story.

Fans were inevitably going to exploit the style, and the creators leaned into that, but it was definitely not for no real reason. And I'm the kind of person who can't stand it when people say "it was intentional" to justify bad design.
            It's literally for no reason except for having the character be sexually appealing, as per Yoko Taro interviews though lmao.  This is on par with excusing Quiet's character design because "She breathes through her skin!!!"
    Yeah, the whole french maid vibe looked dumb. Still kinda think it is, but it grew on me.
I watched a playthrough of Replicant (the original version) on Youtube, and it seemed like a perfect companion to Automata. Lots of similar themes and story beats, but in a good way. I'm psyched to finally get to play this myself.
> How can anyone call this a Graphical update.

To be fair, the original Nier's gameplay wasn't exactly anything to write home about. If the characters, setting, aesthetics and story don't hook you I could totally understand why you'd think it was a mediocre game.

But yeah I think a lot more critics nowadays are willing to tolerate average/bad gameplay if the rest of the game is unique and interesting, so games like Nier will do better. Probably on account of the average reviewer being much older than when I was a teen and having become jaded to gameplay on account of having played all of the millions of technically competent but extremely similar made-by-committee sequel and copycat games that the industry churns out regularly. Which is probably also why critics nowadays tend push indie games a lot more too since those are more likely to take big risks and be weird and different.
    As someone who played it to completion on release, the gameplay was kinda awful.

Big gameplay flaws :

* The combat was very weak when compared with contemporaries like Kingdom Hearts.

* The side quests consisted almost entirely of mundane kill x of a specific monster fetch quests

* The weapon upgrade system amounted to grinding one room in one dungeon for tens of hours for one rare drop that was needed in everything.

* Fishing.

Sure there was story, but even at the time of playing, the weight of the poor gameplay was palpable and caused the experience to be a total slog.

That doesn't even speak to the technical issues that resulted in huge spikes of lag and frame drops everywhere. 

I don't care how compelling the story was; the game deserved a 7/10. And honestly, you were drip fed so little of it at any given time that it was hard to piece it all together against the gameplay. I ended up just reading summaries on gamefaqs after beating it all to have it one place.
        I played the game to completion on release as well and I fully agree with this. I have found memories of the story but I remember kinda hating the janky combat. I also remember discovering a spear-dash into dodge-roll combo that basically broke the entire combat system because it let you do hit-and-run attacks while being almost untouchable so you didn't need to bother learning enemy attack patterns anymore.

Honestly my very first concern when I heard about the remaster was to pray that they fix the combat system because as much as love Nier, I'm not willing to replay it again unless the gameplay is improved.
            it feels much better. magic and melee is woven together way more smoothly, and although the combos don't have anything on automata ( makes sense. these aren't combat androids ) it's definitely an enjoyable experience this time.
Yeah that game came out at the peak of games fitting x model for success. That was just after even nintendo caved into making an edgier zelda because people wanted grim and dirty.
    Twilight princess came out nearly 6 years before iirc
        Plot twist: They are talking about >!The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds that launched in 2013!<

>!I'm joking!<

>!Unless...!<
    Nah TP was supposed to be another OOT-like(a somber, at times quite dark game whos original release even included bleeding enemies during combat & some cutscenes) and it was a direct reaction to the spaceworld Zelda demo showcasing the potential of the GC. The demo was done in OOT/MM like artstyle and people expected a return to form for the Zelda franchise after MM(3.3 million sales) failed to sell as much as OOT(7.6m). 

Later on Nintendo revealed the next zelda with a childrens cartoon aesthetic the opposite of OOTs at times dark and more realistic style. The fan reaction... was not pretty. WW(4.4m) didn't sell so much either, TP became the next game in development and it garnered massive hype throughout its dev cycle. TP ended selling so much it broke franchise records selling 8.8 million units.
That would depend on the magazine I think. :)

Definitely from the mid 2000s PC gamer was more into the overall experience. Back into the 90s Amiga magazines I read would do the "graphics, sound, gameplay" scores and add them up.
Nier wasn't a good game though by standards then and now. Amazing story and soundtrack but environments were extremely dull and boring and combat was lame. As long as they fixed those two things, which it seems like they have, the game should be great.
Hardly seems fair to judge any story game with out finishing it. I can do it cuz I'm just some fucking guy and if it doesn't hold my attention so that's fine, but if it's your job to review a game, seems you should have to finish at least the story before you can give a fair assessment. Imagine writing a review on a movie you didn't finish.
    I think there's a big difference between a movie that lasts between 90 and 180 minutes, and a game that could take 30-40 hours, especially when you've gotta get a review out on deadline. There's a certain point, I think for me it's about 5 hours into a game like this, where it's totally reasonable to bail if you're not hooked.
        well sure, but thats if you're not a reviewer.   


im sorry but I could never trust a reviewer that bails on a 40 hour game 5 hours in unless its just absolutely terrible or not fun.   


if you try to review a 40 hour game that you've only played 5 hours of, you shouldnt be reviewing it at all. maybe it can be part of a smaller segment where you give your two cents, but a full review? I dont know if thats fair. 

but I do think there there are exceptions. for example girlfriend reviews recently did a video on persona 5. that game can run any where from 60 to 200 hours of game play depending on how much you try to do. Persona 5 is, I think for day one reviewers anyway, a hard game to review for because its so damn long. That said, they did mention that they were going to finish the game and if I recall correctly provide a follow up. But they did get a good way through it, I even saw them playing on twitch at a part of the game that takes like any where from 20 to 60 hours to get to so they definitely saw more than the first 5% of the game.   


I just think for a FULL proper review of any given game, you gotta see the story out to the end at least.
            If a game isnt fun in the first 5 hours it's a bad game, sorry.  Why would I want to slog through 5 or 10 hours of boredom for it to maybe get good when there are fun games I can play instead?

Reviewers should finish games but for the opposite reason, to identify if games just use cheap tricks to make you think its good in the demo but with no satisfying story or endgame
    For me, if the game isnt good within the first 30 minutes then I'm not going to keep playing. Time is a valuable resource to me, and I like to think most people feel the same.
        I don't really think that's a viable rule to follow for most RPGs tbh
            I think it matters for any game. It's not about everything being great but if there's nothing that hooks you in the first 30-60 minutes why keep wasting your time?

It can be anything, graphics, combat, dialogues, voice acting, anything really but there has to be something compelling and this will be different for each person and each game.
            Most games rely on a loop of actions. If I'm not enjoying the loop then it's probably just not for me.
Drakengards' performance was bad but I'm pretty the original Nier ran pretty well especially for a ps3/xbox 360 title.
    Having just replayed both nier and drakengard 3 on ps3, holy mother of god D3’s performance was genuinely baffling. I have no idea how it got released in that state. Nier was great :)
        Honestly, Saying the frame rate was trash was being generous

And this is coming from someone who lord the game and the franchise.
It was Joystiq, and he did eventually notice he was doing something wrong. He never did a full review for it I don't think
People are complaining about the technical issues. It's indeed strange because they haven't even tried it yet, but those are valid concerns.
    I'm playing on PS5 I haven't had any issues so far, just my personal experience
        Complaints come from PC gamers, which have been already been burned by Automata's horrible PC port.
Really fond of the commenters bemoaning that it's locked to 60fps on PC, and also that it has problems over 60fps. 

It has a couple of clear issues but inconveniences more than game breakers and focusing on them isn't missing the forest for the trees as much as it's missing the entire pacific northwest for a few ugly leaves.
    I can’t imagine skipping a classic because you can’t play it above 60fps.
        Hell, I highly doubt the original was playing at 60fps to begin with. So, it's definitely not a good reason to pan this game.
            You're right. Gestalt was 30 FPS max (besides emulation hacks), and it sometimes went into the teens: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmYONPPAag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmYONPPAag)
            The original was not a PC game, came out during the 360/PS3 era where games had awful sub 30fps framerate and was a low budget title made by a subpar dev team(ignoring Taro's talent).

This is a PC game following up an incredibly successful game that sold 5.5million units being released in the year of flying cars: 2021. Not at all comparable.
        A game locked at 30fps might give me pause, but anything over 60fps is more of a luxury for most games. Over 120hz I genuinely can't tell the difference most of the time.
            It might be a case of getting used to something, I have been playing pc games on 4K for the past 2 years, and playing a game at 1080p feels like I'm playing on 144p. I never played on 144hz but from what I hear it's hard to go back. (Not that I think its a reason to ignore a classic game like this, hell, bloodborne is locked to 30 and I will forever recommend it)
                I agree, but I think there's probably a point with framerate where you hit diminishing returns. Like, from 30-60 is a world of difference, but 60-144 is felt less in games with without twitchy camera movements, and 144-240hz even less so. For me, I don't see any difference over 144hz even in shooters.
                    The difference between 60 to 144 is like 38fps vs 60fps (frame time wise); still a very noticeable difference and hard to go back to. Not sure about 240hz+ though
                I guess it depends on the person, but I have no problem playing games even at 30 fps after experiencing 144 Hz. Over time I realized that cosistent frame times are far more important to me than frame rate (ideally I'd want both of course). Also, VRR is a godsend, especially on displays over 60 Hz.
                I think the 144hz argument is only true for some game types. Yeah playing something that requires fast reaction times like a FPS will definitely feel worse if you're under 144FPS. But I can can go back to skyrim and not really feel any worse with its locked framerate.
        Right? Who are these people?
            PC gamers.
            I see melodramatic comments like that on here all the time that get pretty good reception. I just chalk it up to the extremists of an already fringe community. Most normal people really don't give a shit.
    You're right, 60FPS is fine. What isn't fine is that animations are tied to the framerate. This has been a big no-no in games for over the past decade. If your framerate goes above or below 60fps weird things can start to happen.

>There are no options for VSync and framerate limit, which is important because running it above 60fps speeds Replicant’s animations up, making boss fights much harder than they should be. A regular stutter, which seems to be linked to a controller issue on Steam, is equally annoying – mine would periodically disconnect during these stutters...

PC gamers should probably wait for Digital Foundry to release an analysis on the game.
        Tying gameplay to framerate is dubious programming but not unheard of.  But tying gameplay to framerate without limiting the framerate is just trolling.
        Breath of the wild did it
    > Really fond of the commenters bemoaning that it's locked to 60fps on PC, and also that it has problems over 60fps.
> 
> 

It's 2021, that shit isn't really acceptable anymore.
        I could not give less of a shit about a framerate so long as it runs at 60fps, but the point I'm making is if it's locked to 60 then you can't exactly complain that it functions incorrectly above 60. That's the same criticism twice.
        Dude it runs at 60 fps. I have everything I would need to run it at 144hz 1440p but I don't care.

These are technical hurdled imposed by time, you gotta know when things are big enough to justify the work to rework the engine and events
            Agreed. It's wild to think that many games were stuck at 30fps on the generation of consoles that *just* ended, and people are already treating 120fps as mandatory instead of a luxury.
                no better way to get developers to raise their standards of output quickly, though.
        [deleted]
            Yeah really. If I can go up over 60 that's awesome I love extra high fps, but 60 solid is the goal and 144 is brownie points.
            [deleted]
                [deleted]
        Imagine skipping a masterpiece because 60fps isn't enough. Lmfao
People who comment on online gaming forums care more about technical minutiae than the audience most reviewers are writing for.
Honestly, the original Nier holds up pretty well and is a lot more engaging than other JRPGs of the time and even the endless brown/grey shooters that everyone loved back then. The combat isn't the best but it's fun enough for what it is.
Interesting. I haven’t played it in a long, long time but IMO the “just fine” combat was worth putting up with for what I got in return. It really is THAT good and I think from a narrative standpoint it is a bit better than Automata as well.
    Absolutely. The combat was serviceable, and that's all it needed to be.

I think I still like Automata more overall, but that's completely from a taste/personal preference. I don't think I could make any kind of argument as to Automata being an objective improvement but rather just an expansion of some of the ideas in the original.

Both are absolutely some of my favorite games ever.
        When I saw that Platinum was attached to Automata I screamed an internal “fuck yes” because Nier already had the Yoko Taro and Okabe secret sauce. Pair that with Platinum’s flair and you get one of my favorite games ever too, in nearly every aspect.
            Did you guys like the combat in Automata? I was really excited about Platinum being involved and I loved the game overall, but I found the combat sub par. I hate how the optimal way to play is to hold in the shoot button at all times.
                Again, I think it's serviceable. I think it's better than the original Nier's combat, but it's nothing all that special. I appreciate that it's non-intrusive. I know platinum excels at intricate combat systems but I appreciate that Nier Automata isn't quite as in-depth as a Bayonetta or what have you.
                I'm not far in, but that's probably my one thing. I don't like having to hold down the trigger *forever*.
                    >I'm not far in,

Get off this subreddit before you see spoilers!
                        No >:D
                    It gets old really fast and it's even worse on higher difficulties when you take insane dmg at close range and thus has to rely more on range attacks to kill spongey enemies. Automata is one of those games were I kind of regret not going for the easy mode.
                        As someone who just finished route A on hard, I almost never had to use my ranged attack, like at all (except the ship part of course).

EDIT: Oh, I think the only time I used ranged attack is against the centipede in the castle.
                            I think they're saying the held the trigger down the entire time they were in combat while using the melee attacks. 

If I remember right, there's an option to just toggle it on and off. Either that or the attack was so weak I just didn't bother with it anyway. I know I wasn't holding the trigger down the entire time.
                It’s definitely Platinum’s weaker ones, but it’s still pretty slick, flashy and badass which I love.
                I would go so far to say the combat is substanceless. The game has great aesthetics, themes and character performances, but the one thing holding back is... its gameplay
                    Definitely disagree with you there. IMO the big pitfall of automatas combat is just that it rewards certain mashable strategies, but if you really learn the intricacies of the combat it’s absolutely not completely lacking of substance. You can be pretty creative when you know what to do, [like this guy does.](https://youtu.be/d3Eh0jbddmk)

I understand your point of view though because instead of all that flashy stuff you *could* just spam evade and sprinting heavy attack. But i believe they just wanted to make the game very easily accessible. If you want to take the combat to the next level, you can.
                I started enjoying it quite a bit after replaying the game on Very Hard. Learning how to control groups and isolate enemies with extended juggles by using animation cancels made the experience much more satisfying, as did actually learning boss attack patterns. It's not the best combat system out there, but it's more than just serviceable in my opinion. 

Although, the game certainly is at fault if dying in one hit is the only way it can make me learn attack patterns. Healing is way too forgiving and powerful enemies should have some level scaling.
                it had good animation and sound design (putting it above most other action RPGs) but you could basically mash your way through everything and dodging was easy. It was also really easy to break the RPG side to trivialize things further. It's no DMC or Bayonetta but still fun.
                Automata's combat was pretty shallow especially for Platinum but I didn't really tire of it until a couple of playthroughs in. I honestly can't remember if I played it on hard or very hard but a lot of things (especially in the early game) practically one-shot me so combat became a kind of hokey cokey dance of dipping in and out, spinning around (i.e. spamming dodge). Once I got a feel for it I actually really enjoyed it, had its own rhythm and its beautifully animated. I liked it enough to go out of my way to make it look as flashy as possible (sliding about on sand was a particular favourite of mine), which helped make up for the lack of depth to a point.
                The level scaling and instant healing are both busted as well. The former makes it a complete slog to kill anything significantly higher level than you, while the latter makes anything that isn't a one hit kill almost meaningless.

Combat looks cool and the characters are fun to control, but the actual combat design is awful.
    >  It really is THAT good and I think from a narrative standpoint it is a bit better than Automata as well.

Both the narrative and the characters were better than Automata
        Debatable. 

Automata had better VA performances, and emotions.

But to a character like Kainé, 9S/2B/A2 don't hold a candle.

Overall, Automata is superior though.
            > 
> Automata had better VA performances, and emotions.

VA performance don't really impact on whether a character is better or not though, that's just production stuff. And Kaine VA > all of Automata.

>Overall, Automata is superior though.

It was the more well rounded game. It had better pacing and combat, while still having a solid story. But Gestalt will always be way more of a memorable game for me, in big part because Automata's android characters just didn't hit the same way as emil/kaine/weiss
i think the biggest issue is that it was a glaringly low budget game. ultimately automata was just far easier to market to a wider audience with platinum and the 2B ass memes, all gestalt/replicant had was "wait this game has godlike music and writing and the gameplay blows" as its tag line
    Also, Platinum Games made Automata. It's not even necessary to watch a gameplay to know that a game made by them will have a great frenetic, fast paced, fun combat. Everyone expects that. Can't say the same about Cavia, who *was* known for its... anime games?
As someone who got about 10 hours in then bounced off when it first came out, I think the original Nier wasn't *bad*, but it lacked a clear identity and that can be frustrating for players early on. It tried to weave a mystery but felt more like an erratic, messy narrative. And the combat was... Serviceable, but boring. And the weird, Yoko Taro flair of layered endings, multiple playthroughs to get the full story and bizarre canonization of Drakengard.

My guess is by riding the wave of Nier Automata's success by iterating and improving on much of the above, some better tech and reliable recognition, it made sense to revisit this and modernize it.
> I'm kind of confused as to the cold reception it got at release.

NieR was released at a time when Japan's influence in the west was at an all time low and every western dev was aping Gears Of War. If your game wasn't brown, grey, or starred a dude who shot a gun and looked like they ate steroids for breakfast, then it was probably going to be largely ignored.
    The original NieR was largely brown and its starring dude did look like he eats steroids for breakfast.
        Yeah, Papa NieR only exists because Yoko Taro was trying to appeal to the west. Fat lot of good that did. If we're being honest though, the main "problem" with NieR was that it was a Japanese game that didn't fit in into the traditional mold.
            And video game reviewers are on average kind of shit at reviewing narratives.
            I still prefer Papa Nier compared to Brother Nier just on the basis that I like the narrative of a father saving their child more than a sibling saving them ... Both are still great however
    Nier was all of that, minus the gun. It was ignored because it was grindy as fuck and the gameplay was ass.
        I don’t think you can blame the Ending C and D grind since most reviewers probably didn’t even get there.
The game looked like crap, ran like crap and had tonnes of grind and repetition. Combine that with the shallow combat, lack of QoL features, other jank like the dumb party AI, and even some messy story bits, I think the reception was pretty well justified back then.
I was just playing it this morning. I couldn't wait and had to scratch my itch for it, haha. I feel like it holds up fine.

Honestly the worst part of the game for me can be the fishing mini game, but moreso that it's just a bit enraging at times.
I think its a combination of factors, mostly that mainstream gaming media wasn't quite at the point then where it was ready to judge the appeal of games on something other than marketing bullet points (i.e. that a game could be valuable as an aesthetic or emotional experience instead of just as a "game") and there weren't many platforms yet for fans to talk up its good points. Its also important to remember that games like Nier weren't actually all that uncommon in the 6th and early 7th gen. "Weird , mid market Japanese games" came out pretty regularly, and while they rarely became mainstream hits they were still common enough that you could find them lining the shelves of just about any game store. Weird arty games like Ico and Shadow of the Collossus were huge, and even Drakengard 1 was a modest hit for the time. And Nier was competing in the same space as games like Demon's Souls, it was a niche but a reasonable crowded one where you could be a little spoiled for choice. So a game just having a unique aesthetic might not be enough to carry it. But now that they've become less common, and interest/acceptance has risen in the mainstream thanks to break out hits like Yakuza 0, Nier: Automata, and Dark Souls, its gotten easier to look back and reevaluate these things for what they were rather than for how they didn't conform with the expectations of the time.
I wouldn't say that. It's a game that has flawed or mediocre graphics and gameplay, but great writing and music. I can't fault reviewers for scoring it based off of all of it's attributes rather than just it's best ones. It's not a game for everyone
It does give it a certain mystique tho lol. I’m not sure if this is due to Automata’s success but it has a certain aura and reputation about it. I really, really hope this remaster allows more peeps to give it a shot.
    The best part of the remake to me is definitely that all the people that missed it originally, because it fell under the radar, get to experience one of the most memorable games I can think of
IDK I think I thought about it long enough that the remake was announced and sounds like a better iteration of the game. The original was often called "ultra interesting" but a chore to play.
    Those people never played Drakengard
        I'm watching and longplay and what the fuck and why on earth.

It does look like mediocre gameplay with an interesting plot but it's just so weird.
            Its a really bizarre game that the secret ending leads into Nier. Its set up like a Dynasty Warriors game but the entire game, the music, the graphics, the gameplay, the story are all designed to make you paranoid and agitated.
                I can see that regarding eveyrthing but the gameplay. It just looks mindless as hell, like a Dynasty Warriors game without the spectacular. Kinda like the first Onechambara.

Then it all goes to what in the fuck land in the final third. I'm kinda glad for these games longplays are a thing. Due to a lack of hardware I can't really play these games right now (man I'd love if Sony gave a shit about BC for these kind of games. Also Valkyrie Profile), but at least I can see and somehow know what are they about.

Seriously that ending with the **Spoiler:** >!flying demonic babies!<. I saw that years ago somehow and thought it was a nightmare I had, and even when I started looking into Taro's games I had an idea this was it and could not figure out how it ended up like that.
                    "It just looks mindless as hell" - yeah that sounds pretty unnerving and agitating since you dont need to think and all you hear is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NocSlsBJHxY&ab_channel=Durandana

Or maybe it had some problems not everyone is willing to overlook.
    I'm not saying its a perfect game, it had plenty of flaws. But if you compare to every other game that has a 68 meta score....

It got done poorly mostly because it was a JRPG coming out at that time, and because it wasn't big budget
I think reviewers definitely knew what they were playing then.  
  
I got OG Nier at release. It already looked worse than other games already on the market and already felt like it was made in a budget. The voice acting was just okay and only really serviceable if you were into anime voice actors. The gameplay was alright, but wasn’t exactly exceptional either. The only real highlight was the fact that it incorporated bullet hell aspects into it, which was very new for the time. And the story, atleast intro-wise, was just kind of standard, but there were better looking and more polished action RPGs already at the time. The game was also somewhat buggy.  
  
The game was totally reviewed fairly back when it released. The story, for how good it actually ends up being, doesn’t make up for every other aspect of the game just being “okay”, especially considering how much work you have to put in to really get to the meat of the story.
    > The voice acting was just okay

Sorry, but you're crazy.
        That I think it’s just okay? Should I have thought it was better? Because I have my OG copy of the game and the voice acting was just alright. Not bad by any means, but wasn’t exactly top tier by any means either.  
  
At the time, it was just standard anime voice actors. If that floats your boat, that’s totally cool. But it wasn’t top tier
            Nah the voice acting is some of the best of the time.
                Considering all the other games of 2010, I think that’s definitely up for debate and likely in regards to whether you prefer dub anime voice actors or not, but I am by no means crazy for finding the voice acting to just be okay. “Okay” isn’t bad.
            You're fine to have your opinions. But by and large the voice acting in OG Nier is considered to be phenomenal and its voice cast is stacked as fuck by today's standards. Like you really gonna say a game with Jameson Price and Laura Bailey as the main cast has bad voice acting?

Again you're welcome to have your opinion, but recognize that a majority of people disagree with your opinion and future success of the voice actors points to them being talented. Not saying you're wrong, just saying most people would think you're wrong.
                Considering how poorly the first game sold and reviewed, I don’t think it’s crazy find the voice acting as just okay. Again, I never said it was bad. Not once. “Okay” does not equal “Bad”. It just means “Okay”. Those two people don’t suddenly make the voice acting anymore fantastic. Again, they’re just anime voice actors and they aren’t bad by any means, but aren’t exactly setting the world on fire with their performances in OG Nier either. Never said they weren’t talented. Never said they were bad. Just that the overall voice acting of the game is just okay and somewhat par the course for a lot of JRPGs of the time.  
  
Please, understand that I’m not saying the voice acting is bad by any means. I’m just saying it wasn’t top tier either and I think that is a completely fair assessment given the overall quality of the game.  
  
There is such an odd defensiveness of OG Nier as if it can’t be stated that the game has flaws. I love OG Nier. I personally find it fantastic, but there is a very clear reason why it wasn’t widely viewed as a big deal at launch. And that’s okay
                    Out of interest, what games would you consider to have top-tier voice acting, particularly from the same period? I thought Nier's was pretty great (Kaine and Weiss at least), but I haven't played a ton of games.
                    No. Didn't you hear them? You need to have their opinion because it's a popular one!!! Everyone would disagree! etc
                    > Again, they’re just anime voice actors

Anime voice actors is just a weird term to use, because tons of voice actors do tons of things. You're differentiating anime voice actors from...what? Voice actors who only do animated shows and movies? If you look at most big name voice actors in games, they probably have some anime on their backlog. In fact, a ton probably do. 

Take The Last of Us, which is probably the furthest you could get from anime, plenty of the main voice actors there have done plenty of anime. Troy Baker voices Joel but did anime for like 10 years before he even got the part. Laura Bailey voices Abby in TLoU2 and has also done a ton of anime, in addition to being Kaine. But they didn't just do anime, they were doing a wide variety of other video games too: western games and Japanese games both. 

That's not to say you can't have your opinion or that it's invalid, I just don't think "anime voice actors" is even really all that useful a distinction. Almost all working video game VAs, including the ones in Nier, do a mix of anime, American cartoons, Western video games, and Japanese video games.
    > And the story, atleast intro-wise, was just kind of standard,

If you don't finish a game, you shouldn't review it

/edit suggesting Professional paid critics should finish a game before reviewing it is controversial? The fuck is this subs sometimes?
        If you state you didn't finish the game and exactly why I think a review is totally fine. You might miss out on part of what makes a game something special but then the reader and either write it off altogether or seek out another review to decide if it's worth it. 

Especially with a game like Nier - it finishes stronger than it starts narratively but vastly worse gameplay-wise, and if nothing up front in the first ten or so hours catches someone's interest enough to put up with its worse aspects, it's unlikely anything in the last ten hours will make up for that.
            > If you state you didn't finish the game and exactly why

Isn't Nier the game where the [reviewer gave up after the game told him to catch a fish and didn't explain that no, you needed the fish from over THERE](https://www.engadget.com/2010-05-03-nier-review-fail.html).
                yup yup. the part my guy Juice there leaves out is that the instructions for how to fish in the game are also incorrect, so a reviewer would just have to fuck around until it worked before they even get around to figuring out there's somewhere else to fish.
            And it's not like a game can't do it better while delivering the same themes. Nier Automata proves that decisively. Enjoyable gaming experience right from the get-go, and narratively engaging at the start. Of course, it's really in ending C-E where it reaches its amazing apex, but even without those endings, it would still be a quality experience.
        Even if you finish the whole game, it's valid to critique how long the game takes to get good. Most people aren't going to go through hours of mediocre gameplay and basic story just to get to the good part.
        I disagree. Not wanting to completely finish a game is a valid reaction, after all.

Let's take it to the logical extreme: imagine how warped the reviews would be if BotW only got reviewed by people who gathered all 900 Korok seeds. It would basically filter out everyone except the most hardcore players who just so happened to be most compatible with that particular game!

Games *can* be experienced without achieving some arbitrary measure of completeness. Reviews should reflect that basic truth. If a reviewer couldn't stomach finishing a game, *you bet* that I would want to know that. I want a review that actually represents the reviewer's individual experience with the game, not a fruitless attempt at assigning something as nebulous as artistic value or intrinsic worth.
        I don't think it applies with this game.

I love NieR:A. One of my favorite games of all time.

That said. I wouldn't recommend it to most people. The beginning of the game drags way too long and is the worst aspect of the game IMO.

The game doesn't really pick up story-wise till after you 'beat the game' once.

I dropped the game once before getting to the parts I really liked.

Guess my point is I think its totally valid for someone to burn out on one of these games before completing it especially because they quite literally demand you to replay the game over again before really seeing significant progress in the story.
        Right, but the game doesn’t start to truly standout until it’s latter half. Even for as good as the endings and really last half of the story is, the intro is still pretty standard and wasn’t exactly enticing a wide range of people at the time. You have to play the first half to get to the fantastic last half story, but if it’s a bit of a slog to get there, that’s going to affect the overall opinion of the game. The endings of the game, for as great as they are, didn’t make up for the rest of the game that was already rather lackluster for its time.  
  
And I say this as someone who loves original Nier
        Why? I don't have to finish a bad meal to know I'm not going to enjoy it. If a movie isn't grabbing me an hour in I'm not gonna lose sleep over giving it 1 star on Letterboxd. Why should I have to play every single minute of a video game before being able to leave a review?
            You shouldn't ever have to play through the entire game for a review, just as long as you let the reader know you didn't finish it in the article. That way, they can make an informed decision about whether the review is useful or not.
        I wonder how many reviewers even knew how to get the true ending. All weapons is somewhat of a chore, even if NG+ runs are quick.
            Getting all the weapons isnt too bad and it isnt like Drakengard where you have to max them all out
                >Getting all the weapons isnt too bad 

That's quite a understatement, heh. You could miss out on some of them in first half of game without a guide and after halfway point, you were pretty much softlocked unless you chose to restart over all way from the beginning.
                    There are no missable weapons in Nier. You can get every single weapon at the very end of the game.
                        Weird, I recalled just giving up after reading some guide mentioning I missed some quests with weapon rewards.
                            Nope, there is only 1 weapon that you can "miss" by not doing a sidequest and that weapon can be bought at a shop for a period of time after the "timeskip". So if you miss it on your first playthrough, when you start at the midway point during your second you can go buy it.
Or maybe the story only propped up the game so much for them? There's no need to be all high-and-mighty just because you liked the game a lot.
I thought Automata was boring, ugly and extremely overrated. Would I enjoy Replicant? I'm assuming no.
The connecting story is intentionally surreal and hard to follow, you won't really *get* how the two are connected until you play both (in addition to digesting some amount of side-content). There's over 9000 years between the events of Nier and Automata, so they're hardly directly sequels!

All of that's to say that you can play either first without hurting the "intended" experience. Anything that *could* be spoiled is only sort of *knowingly hinted at* in such a way that's only obvious to the player in hindsight, after playing both games.
Yeah, they’re not super duper linked but playing this followed by Automata seems like a good idea.
Well technically Nier is a sequel to Drakengard's (kind of) joke ending which is, of course, a sequel to Drakengard 3. And there's some short stories dotted around, at least one stage play, maybe some manga, whatever Yoko Taro posts on twitter, not Drakengard 2... Honestly, I really think that Automata was probably the first to catch on quite like this because it's the first one that's not actively annoying to play. But by the sounds of it they've sorted out the gameplay issues in Replicant so you grab either that or Automata for a great standalone experience. 

They're not super closely linked and the time gap between the two is... a while, but there are a few links in Automata that gave me all the feels to discover, and I can definitely see a lot of Automata players having the same experience of discovery with the new Replicant

TL;DR: Both great, both work on their own and as a pair. Be shallow; if you want cute androids then go Automata first, if you want to be [yelled at by a glorious trash monster every time you boot up the game](https://youtu.be/OvyvQfn30uE) then Replicant's your best bet, they'll fuck you up either way
    Nier is just a spin-off to drakengard.
    > if you want to be yelled at by a glorious trash monster every time you boot up the game

Turns out I would very much like to get yelled at by a glorious trash monster, huh.
It's the 4th!

Drakengard > Drakengard 1 > Drakengard 3 (released after Nier) > Nier > Automata

(I might have the canonical order of the drakengard games backwards too, it gets messy.)

They have interconnecting themes and some recurring characters, but you don't need to play them in order. While specific endings are canonical and lead on to the next game, it's more a shared universe sort of deal.

(Drakengard 2 was developed by another studio without Taro, and while it follows on from Drakengard 1, it otherwise exists outside the canon and also *isn't very good.*)
Both games spoil elements of each other's plots. I would recommend playing OG Nier first because I think the plot revelations hit a little bit harder going that way, but either way you're gonna get spoiled on something from the other game so just go with whichever you want.
    And Replicant is "OG Nier" just updated?
        The more accurate/complicated answer is that there were two versions of OG NieR in Japan - NieR Replicant (PS3) and NieR Gestalt (Xbox 360).

NieR Replicant had a young protagonist (brother trying to save his sister); NieR Gestalt had an older protagonist (father trying to save his daughter). Other than that, they're the same game.

But Replicant didn't get localized in the West, only Gestalt did, and they dropped the subtitle since there was only one version - so the North American game "NieR" is NieR Gestalt, with the "father" protagonist (and it got released on PS3 as well in the West, unlike in Japan).

This game is an updated remaster of NieR Replicant, the version with the "brother" protagonist that we never got in the West.
Shadowlord from Nier is probably in my top 5 video game tracks of all time.
Unfortunately the new arrangements are overall almost all downgrades from the originals. The one thing that didn't need any updating....
No I completely agree. I didn’t mean it as new games have better design than old games, it’s just that Nier has some pretty damn weird design choices.
I only played the last of us for the first time in september but I only remembered the ridiculous amount of bugs I encountered playing it when I read this comment lol. That ending was so good it went from "a pretty cool game" to one of my all time favourites.
    [deleted]
        I was on PS4 and I had loads of little bugs here and there, the Kind that makes you laugh rather than impacting it badly though. My personal favourite was my weapon getting stuck spinning around all over the place like Joel is a magician.
            Sorry but I don’t think this is common
> Spec Ops, 

Re:railroading, I’d say that illustrates a key weakness of that game: its very topical commentary (c. 2012) and only having one chance to pull you in otherwise it fails.
The gameplay and design should be worse but as someone who played Nier 1 before Automata I feel the story and music was much better on the original than the sequel(this is actually a common fan sentiment). That said this remake changes the music a lot so it might not have the same impact as the original.
You wish the worst because the PC port is lacking?
    And will probably never be fixed if Automata is anything to go by.
        They're working on a patch for Automata right now. Unless you're aware of that and implying it'll never come out.
            Wow already? That was fast. Can't believe it only took them 4 years.
            Took them 4 years, you wanna wait 4 years for all their PC ports to potentially get fixed? 

While they're at it, maybe they should upgrade from ps2/3 era graphics fidelity.
                You realize this is a remaster of a ps3 game from 2010 right? Maybe you should look up a graphics comparison video if you think it’s ps3 era.
    If they dont want us to play their game is their problem, i pass buying games that devs didn't gave a single fuck to make the pc version at least working...
    Not OP, but you’ll find that sentiment to be common among the pc gaming community.

There’s already more good games coming out than most people have time to play, no point spending that time playing games or supporting devs that have poor pc ports. Japanese developers need to get with the times and recognize that it’s a growing platform with millions of people and start caring more about bringing proper ports to the platform
    I feel like this is par for the course for online gaming discourse, I understand people are disappointed and unhappy with SE but people need to have some perspective.
Sure buy it 4 years later
Can't wait for a modern remake of Drakengard.

That level of weirdness is going to melt people's brains. The music alone is on another level.

        >cum

Zero will violate you, both from and back, all in 60 FPS.
            I want to find that interview where Taro jokingly mentions the difficult frame was to make you feel bad about what was happening because how awful your character was. How hype is the idea that the game itself doesn’t want you to commit game crimes so it’s actively trying to prevent you from going forward. It’s a joke and not reality, but such a funny idea. My favorite are games that when making a choice ask you if you are sure, but then a second window appears right after to go “but, are you really sure?”.
Even Cyberpunk had the odd naysayer. I suspect the reviews are all aware of how the original game had some really boring systems so there's not much else to say there.
To be fair automata was not much better I love that game but stopped doing side stuff pretty quickly.
    Ah the stories as a whole were pretty good in side-quests for Automata, but I can't argue that they were designed as basic fetch quests and some seemed interested in just wasting your time. 


IIRC side-quests in the first Nier were significantly worse. There are a few standout ones like the Lighthouse sidequest but by and large its just really one-note fetch quests with little story impact. I guess I just find the idea of androids/robots trying to learn what it means to be human and exploring that through side-quests to be a more natural and interesting conceit than just "me hungry get mutton thx".
    At this point I am sure they are just parodies of shitty sidequest in other jrpgs.
    Uhhh, there was a lot of quality content in the side quests that added a lot to the story. Off the top of my head, I remember one that involved Yorha's executioner models by going deeper into their back stories, and another that went into a whole philosophical concept. How are these bad side quests exactly?
Holy shit, I played this game wayyyy back in the PS3 days, and your comment is the first time I heard I was supposed to play it three times. I missed out on so much shit wtf ahahahah no wonder I was always left a bit confused by the story
    Automata is the same way if you ever play that, don't stop at ending A!
I mean, that was the original game. Great story, shit gameplay. Also the requirements to get the full story are a miserable grind. It was a game you'd honestly probably get more enjoyment out of watching a lets play maybe than actually playing through it. I was kind of hoping this version might fix some of these issues in some way, but I guess not?
My assumption is that it caps at the monitor refresh rate and the PC Gamer reviewer had a 60Hz monitor and didn't realise this was the case
    My assumption is similar, although what I'm betting is that the one reviewer that had capped FPS played the game on fullscreen borderless (which caps the game's FPS to the monitor/desktop refresh rate without needing V-Sync), while the other played on "true" fullscreen.
Digital Foundry will probably cover it.
    I adore Nier but I'll wait for their video (or someone's in-depth performance analysis) before I pick it up. Don't want to risk buying it only to find out that it has massive frame drops, frame pacing issues, or worse.
        Yep, Automata is one of my fav games (played on release on PS4) but playing it recently on steam it was a buggy mess, just refunded before the two hours, the game pass version is okay but I still had a crash and some drops below 60 unfortunately
        Automata was unplayable to me until I installed FAR.  FAR fixed everything but a really minor frame pacing issue in the open game world.  Played perfect in the actual "zones" though.
>Sucks though that PC again gets the short end...

I, for one, am shocked that a company that never bothered to patch their previous game in spite of crippling technical issues and only announced they'd work on a patch when preorders for their new game were open would release said new game with crippling technical issues.
> The main issue seem to be controller disconnecting after a stutter.

There was a report saying they accidentally disconnected their controller during a session and that caused the stutter.

I think I've heard some are experiencing random controller disconnects, and apparently this might be AMD CPU issue. My USB headset will cut out every once in a while and apparently this is a common issue (though none of my controllers ever have). Supposedly getting a BIOS update fixes this.
They'll fix them you just have to wait for the next nier game.
[removed]
    I dunno if 'they're fixing automata 4 years after it's initial release, with no patches in between' should be held up as an example that they will fix the game in a timely manner. Especially when the automata patch isn't even out yet. 


From these reviews it seems like Replicant might be less broken (I don't recall whether automata reviews emphasized how shoddy the pc port was), but that doesn't mean it'll get any more post launch attention.
    Don’t get your hopes up. They’ll most likely only put the Game Pass version on Steam, that barely fixes anything and call it a day.

If they can’t make a new release work, how could we expect them to fix the old one in any way.
        This, and any fix will break the current FAR mod which will require a mod update.
        Two different dev teams.   Maybe Square will let them patch Replicant where they wouldn't let Platinum, since Plat announced they were working on patches before their involvement ended.
You guys do realize that this is a remaster not a full blown remake which means its running mostly on year 2010 code of a low budget game that was never intended to be on anything other than consoles made by a now defunct company that probably had no idea that a decade from now the series will blow up and fans would want the OG game on modern platforms.

These kinds of issues were bound to happen.
    While this is fair in this particular case, a lot of other games still do this and it appears to be a side effect of "make game as fast as possible" not "make game with best practices and future proofing in mind".
it's sadly not uncommon for remasters, but it still really sucks
It’s easier to program, and swat bugs when the timing is fixed at the frame rate.
    It's not "easier to program".

Multipling your value by the frametime is the easiest shit there is, competent devs have been doing it since the late 90s.

There is NO excuse for not doing this nowadays (or 10 years ago for that matter).
    I get that, but I don't get why you would do that for PC when the framerate is going to be so variable. I don't imagine it makes no sense in every scenario, but for stuff like animation speed I just don't understand why you would do that for such a variable environment.
        Precisely because it is so variable. Removing the need to account for framerate differences removes a lot of variance you would need to account for. Especially when you design a game primarily for consoles, when porting to PC it simplifies a lot to just force the PC to act like a console.
Just wait for actual pc port reviews.  Both the reviews that went into any detail whatsoever had completely different experiences that were contradictory.
I just bought it on Series S. Was planning on getting PC but somewhat expected it was gonna get the stepchild treatment.

Absolutely can't wait to play it though.
    I think it's extremely unlikely that the PC version is worse than the Series S version (on a sufficiently fast PC).
        Any plans on patching this game for them? :D
        You're absolutely right. Decided to put the console to use though, feel like I'll enjoy the game more on the couch and take my time with it. Can't wait.
    Since you're on Xbox, you can [change your system's region to play the game right now.](https://old.reddit.com/r/nier/comments/mvhtvw/to_all_xbox_owners_changing_the_consoles_region/)
        You the man dog. Just made my night look a lot better.
There are two types of people: those that love Ghost Trick and those who have never heard of it. Unfortunately most people fall into the latter camp
    I felt like I knew basically all games that people geniunely feel are their "favourites", its cool to find one I absolutely do not fucking know about.
        Ghost Trick is also available on iOS if I remember correctly. I think that might be how I played it actually... wild, awesome story.
PS4 physical copy vs PS5 digital download doesn't make any difference in performance right?
    Nope!  Shouldn’t be any difference since PS4 physical should be backwards compatible on the PS5 - and there wasn’t any version tailored for the PS5 so it doesn’t matter for now
        Great news! I love collecting physical games and WalMart usually has games for about $10 cheaper + compatible with PS5. Win-win-win
>If the first one would not have been a cult classic, this would've stayed at 5/10.

If the first one didn't become a cult classic this one wouldn't have even existed.
[removed]
I agree. I love the NieR franchise, but unless this remake makes some *significant* changes or improvements to the game I really don't see how it deserves a rating higher than 6/10.

(Spoilers) >!Seeing as you have to play through the game three times. It relies too heavily on a single plot twist. The majority of the background, lore, and exposition isn't even included in the actual game but in side novels. Ending D makes no sense other than for feels. The true ending E isn't even included in the game.!< Some of these issues could very well be fixed in the remake, but I don't have high hopes. Sure the original is a cult classic, but I feel it's gonna get scrutinized *heavily* when exposed to a wider audience - especially when people claim it's far better than Automata.
    The achievement list shows that >!Ending E is in the game. Don't know if it's the same one, but regardless there is an Ending E!<
        Oh hell yea, that's great to hear. >!Tbf I wouldn't mind even if it was just an adaptation of the one from the novels. I don't really know the nitty gritty of it besides a TL;DR, and it's been like 4 years since I even read *that*.!<
Yea, that's apparently obvious, most reviews are just pandering for views to their respective audience and never really step on any toes.
I don't know. Part of appreciating art is meeting it halfway. When something is new and strange it can be hard to find the right frame to enjoy it. A more polished mainstream sequel can act as sort of a guide to teach you to notice and appreciate the qualities that were in its predecessor.

Plenty of people now love MGS2 who hated it upon release, myself included. These days we're more accepting of meta-narratives and intentional user-hostile design in 2021 than we were in 2001. Things that used to be alienating now seen as clever and subversive.

My opinion change doesn't mean I was previously disingenuous, it just means that years of life experience and art experience allow me a different perspective than my younger self.
That would make sense if it were literally the same game, but they went back and fixed a lot of the issues reviewers at the time brought up.
    Quite a lot of  the reviews clearly disliked it for feeling dosjointed and a mishmash of multiple genres, then that became a staple and beloved feature with Automata.

True, the combat wasn't as great, and it was uglier, but I wouldn't say that makes it a 5/10, the characters were much more intriguing than Automatas IMO. It still had a stellar voice cast, an incredible story, great characters, a 10/10 soundtrack, deep and emotional sidestories, one of the most conpelling endings in videogame history, and all in all... the combat wasn't bad, just not a highlight and the progression was actually somewhat addicting... it was never such a poor game.

To be fair, I haven't seen all of the changes, but if a change of combat and a small graphical facelift brings a 5/10 to a 9 - 9.5 / 10, I think there's a lot more at play than simply fixing old issues.
game reviews are opinions and opinions can and sometimes should change over time.
I don't think so - playing a remastered cult classic is going to mean you give it a lot more leeway to impress you. A random game comes out that takes 10 hours to get to the good bit and has its own problems besides that? I think anyone would be less lenient with it. Like how if food smells good, it can make you hungrier and more inclined to enjoy it.
[deleted]
oh damn, so this game unfolds like Automata, multiple chapters for the full experience, that's awesome, I loved that about Automata.
    Yep, all the storytelling techniques people loved in Automata originated in this game.
Isn't it a full priced game on steam? does it cost more on consoles?
    oh i dont know about other countries, but im from argentina, and steam regionalizes prices so it isnt as expensive as a playstation game that you have to pay in dollas plus taxes and shit, sucks but thats the way it is
        Damn, Poland is still $60 on Steam so I've decided to wait for a sale :/
    isthereanydeal.com
It appears to be 4k/60 on PSPro/PS5 (and the OneX/Series X). Console will probably be the best place unless some fixes PC with a patch or mod.
    Can't wait for Kaldaien to give us the DRM infused mod we really deserve.
    Really, someone else said it was 900p on series x.
The square root of 1.5 dogshits?

>Well not too many games with MC scores in the 60s get remakes

Which is stupid. The best games to remake would be ones that did something interesting and unique but didn't manage to pull off the execution as well as they should/could have.

For the record, yes I'm aware the reason is money.
Nier Gestalt is one of my absolute favourite games, so subjectively I completely agree with you. But if I look at the game from a slightly more objective perspective...I have to say it just wasn't a great game. Clunky as hell, gameplay was very rough, side-quests tedious, etc. So I get low scores for the original, even though I would personally rate it much higher.
    If games are works of art, an S-Tier story, characters and OST should elevate a C-tier game to a B score.
No it wasn't.
Don't get me wrong I liked Automata, but I felt it was overhyped and heralded as this "Best Game Ever" whereas I played it, enjoyed it and had fun, but not the best game I've ever played, a solid 7 or 8 /10
    Automata is easily my 2nd favourite game of all time, only behind FFX
        ffx fans !
            FFX is also one of my two favorite games of all time. Love that game.
I loved automata (my first exposure to nier) enough to get all 26 endings and Emil pillow merch. About 20 hours into Replicant and I’m considering just watching the cutscenes on YouTube. This game feels terrible to play. I’ve even decided to hold off on side quests in the second half because I can get them on a later play through but even just doing the story is such a chore.
Oh the perspective changes all right. You do you, but I'd go so far to say if you didn't play the B route you didn't experience Nier.
    I'm okay with that, I completely, completely cknowledge I didn't finish it in the slightest. It was just the line in the sand for me, and considering I didn't do all the side quests in the first half I also knew I wouldn't be able to get all the endings. 

Playing to "find out more" Also just wasn't an incentive because I didn't really care about the characters or the story. I did end up reading the developments and watching clips though. :) 

I think for me a great, well told story is like the amazing tasty cherry on a great game but the game play needs to come first. If I'm not enjoying the game I'll just play another game and listen to a lore/story telling video on it on YouTube. 

I have now just started a replay of Auto from the start though and seeing Emil and certain details like the dessert robotsmasks that I had forgot about are awesome. So some genuine joy came out of it.
        > I have now just started a replay of Auto from the start though and seeing Emil and certain details like the dessert robotsmasks that I had forgot about are awesome. So some genuine joy came out of it.

Glad it retroactively worked out for you in that sense in enhanced your Nier: A experience. You may appreciate this trove of information at this stage: >![The Ark](https://theark.wiki/w/Welcome).!<
  
 
> and considering I didn't do all the side quests in the first half I also knew I wouldn't be able to get all the endings. 

Just a heads up in case you come back one day you don't need to do all the side quests, just collect all the weapons (though some Part 2 SQs do give weapons). Any weapons missed in Part 1 can be bought in Part 2 from the shops, so you also don't need to sweat that aspect of it.
Damn.  I feel bamboozled honestly, I really put in trust with people saying that it gets better after 10 hours, really the only reason I didn't return it after I played for 2 hours... Now it's too late.
    Yeah... It's such a shame. I get that it's a remake/remaster of an old game but in that case slapping the £50 price tag on it was a bold move.

oh my god hahahahaha !!! Thank you both for the info
    He's also quoted as stating:

*"Incidentally, the big string of numbers on the end of the title was just something I stuck on randomly, so I wouldn’t think too hard about it if I was you."*

Gotta love the honesty.
    Hes doing it as a joke/parody of Kingdom Hearts' shitty numbering system. If youve never played a YokoTaro game, they are all full of gags and parodies of other shit
well that makes more sense than the various Kingdom hearts names, so that's nice at least.
    Imo it still falls in the Kingdom Hearts territory. It is needlessly complicated and when showed off on a website makes it seem like the listing is broken if you don't already know the game's name
        pretty sure Yoko Taro did that on purpose. he's an edgy guy and it's funny. most people will call it the Nier Replicant remake/remaster and it won't be confusing
            Nier Replicant alone sorta works too since the old one is called Gestalt, and to casual fans this is just a brand new prequel anyway.
        [deleted]
            We're talking about game titles here, not the story
    No it doesn't? The KH names make much more sense than that.
    what? every single KH name makes sense and has a meaning. this narrative about KH being overly complicated is so overblown at this point
        Look I'll be the first to defend the plot of KH as not being all that complicated, but names like " Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover", "Kingdom Hearts 0.2: Birth by Sleep – A Fragmentary Passage", and "Kingdom Hearts Unchained χ/Kingdom Hearts Union χ[Cross]/Kingdom Hearts Union χ Dark Road" are just nonsense.
Not according to [this interview](https://square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/nier-replicant-dev-message?utm_campaign=devmessage_photo_SQEXSOCIAL). Seems like he considers it a "version upgrade". Then he goes on to say

>Incidentally, the big string of numbers on the end of the title was just something I stuck on randomly, so I wouldn’t think too hard about it if I was you.
All the assets have been remade. They aren't simply using upscaled textures like a remaster would. Maybe the underlying code is the same, but that's pretty standard for remakes so it keeps the same feel.
    Yeah, pretty sure i heard the combat was redone from scratch too.
That's like saying Demon's Souls PS5 isn't a remake because it too uses old code.
I love Yoko Taro and his works, but he is very much an eccentric artist. One should try to take comments from such artists regarding their own work with a grain of salt and not as gospel.
    Yes Taro is eccentric but that doesnt mean he lies about shit. He is always very open on development problems that his team run into and budget constraints that he has had to work with. 

Him saying this not a real remake is very much a serious comment made to make sure than fan expectations are grounded. 

Him calling it ver1.22474487139... is him being eccentric and having fun with it.

They are two different aspects of the same person.
        I'm not saying he's lying. I'm saying his perceptions of his own work can be skewed, and that can affect the way he assesses them. In particular, I've picked up on some higher levels of humility and self-doubt when he discusses his work, which could absolutely affect this exact scenario.
            I get what you are trying to say. Taro loves self depreciating. But the "this is not a full remake" is not one of those. It's not just Taro the entire team stated that as a very matter of fact thing. 

As someone who 100% OG NieR, I can tell you this is the same game. They have very clearly shown the part they remade like the core combat and what parts they left exactly the same. Like the environments and stuff. Most of the environment assets arent even remade just upscaled and further polished and the team confirmed that. If people are going in expecting a brand new experience, this is not it. It's gonna feel slightly dated because at its core it is still a low budget ps3 jrpg.
he also tried to claim that Nier's name isn't Nier so are we really taking his word on this kind of thing?
Remake:

* Uses completely brand new assets
* Runs on a completely different, modernized engine that may be similar to the original game engine
* Was built from a brand new codebase
* Retains the original story/concept
* Examples: MGS1 on Gamecube, Demon Souls, RE1/2/3, Link's Awakening, Gen 1-4 Pokemon remakes, FF3/4 on DS

Remaster:

* Uses updated assets (graphical and/or audio)
* Runs on the same engine with possible QOL fixes
* Shares much of the same exact code as the original
* Has the exact same story
* In some cases, a console "remaster" is not much different than a PC game running at higher graphics settings
* Examples: Pretty much every PS3 game released on PS4

Or a TL;DR: If the game looks like someone just turned up their graphics settings, it's a remaster. This game is clearly a remaster.
I've only glanced the PC reviews but it doesn't seem to be "broken." There is a 60fps cap and there are apparently some controller issues on PC, seems very playable but I haven't experienced it myself.
    Also, Nier Automata itself was not broken. It wasn't a good port but it worked. I played it on PC and finished all the main endings. That guy is being dramatic.
        > It wasn't a good port but it worked

For some people.  I bought it on release and never got it working properly on my 770 even with the FAR mod, and I heard similar stories for other people with 700 series cards.  Reinstalled it later when I got a 1080 and it ran fine.
            Yeah it specifically hated the architecture that the 700 and 960 and below ran on.
        I would call crashing every 30 min is broken.
        [deleted]
            These issues only popped up for some people, through multiple systems I've had zero issues other than the framerate which isn't something I completely care about.  
Game never crashed, never had any issue with resolution, had online on for the entire game and multiple playthroughs without issue and this was all at launch with a pc that was pretty standard at the time (i5 4690k, 290x, 16GB DDR3) and still now with a much beefier pc I've had zero issues with the PC version (i9 9900k, 64GB DDR4, RTX 3090)
            Can't say I noticed or experienced all of those. Framerate issues yes. I don't really have a good eye for resolution so if it was the case it didn't bother me. Don't recall getting a CTD but I might be misremembering. Also my rig would have been pretty beefy at the time so might have factored in.

I would never consider watching someone else play a game as a replacement for me playing it. Different strokes, I guess.
                That's all fine, but yeah, Automata was *rough* on release.

I personally dealt with the Resolution issues, Lighting Issues/Artifacts, CTD's, and other things.  Still, I loved the game.
    People have to cap themselves at 60fps. It is not like the game provided an option to cap framerate or tell people to do it.
I mean youre only robbing yourself of a great experience in favor of a shallow, vicarious experience but you do you I guess...
It did come out a bit diplomatic, huh? I just thought the polarised comments and review scores were interesting, and I hope that changes over time 🙂
No happy. Only complains allowed.
And your reads like it's from a bot. 

In fact, I'm not convinced it isn't.
And even these lying reviewers gave Cyberbug and AC Valhalla best reviews than this game on Metacritic lol. I’m not paying 60 bucks for an old game with a below 85 Metacritic score.
It’s the kind of mindset in the industry that convinces people that a full remake of the last of us is a good idea. I’m not a big fan of it but even I can admit that the game has aged phenomenally.
How is that unlike Automata?
    In Automata the B and C runs are a good bit different from the initial A playthrough, but I understand the concept is the same and a lot of B run is similar to A. 

C on the other hand is a whole new playthrough in Automata.
    You don't replay through the same game again in Automata. Route C picks up from where route A&B left off. It's entirely new. And only about half of route B is a replay of route A.

In Replicant, you replay through the entire game each time. There are of course some minor differences, but the only one I remember is an extra cut scene near the end.
You play the game twice, and then you get an additional chapter. But you do play it twice.
You did though. Route B was almost a carbon copy of A story wise with some minor differences and from a different perspective(since you play as 9S.)

It's actually one of my biggest criticisms of the game. A+B could have been more organically condensed into one playthrough with C as the finale. I really can't blame people for not wanting to play the whole game again just to get to the actual good part in route C.

Thankfully if you ignore sidequests it's pretty quick to blitz through B, but you still shouldn't need to do that.
    That's my biggest gripe of the game. I never played B or C but I heard C and beyond is amazing. I didn't even enjoy route A that much so I was never compelled to play B. Feels very tedious imo.
I did. I quit halfway through the second part. It didn't feel different enough to make it an enjoyable experience for me.

So I was curious if this game does the same thing. Because if it does, it's probably not my jam.
    It does.
    Oh trust me it turns into a whole other game shortly after where you stopped.
        That's what I've heard but I was too burned out to push through. I'm glad so many people love it but it just isn't my type of game.
100% agree with this, I was very confused with Automata because all the reviews said you needed to beat the game multiple times to get to the true ending, when I got the true ending I thought damn, I'm going to need to do all the again!  And then I realized that people thought that 9s's part was having to play the game "again" which it isn't.  The different character perspective is the other half of part 1's story, and then part 1 and part 2 converge to push us into part 3.  Not once did I feel like I was playing the game again.  saying you have to beat the game multiple times is a massive disservice to the game, the game is told in episodes and each episode completes the experience, you can't just beat episode 1 and call it a day.
That's commonly called routes or playthroughs. Each character's set if levels is a route.

It isn't that complicated.
> worry not! *the promise of* a patch is only 5 years away!

FTFY. Call me a cynic but I'll believe they're patching Automata when I see it, and I'm half expecting the patch to cause new issues even if they do.
Many games allow usersetting file edits to uncap frame rates. Some people do this and find out it breaks the game if physics are tied to frame rate. Not sure if it applies here but that's the scenario where both could apply.
Uncapping the frame rate with 3rd party software.

They mean a custom fps limit, in case someone wants to cap it to a value below 60.

Edit: I have read that this info is wrong and the game doesn't actually have an fps cap option, despite behaving strangely at any framerate higher than 60.
The game is capped at 60fps by default, but you can't set any other framerate limits within the game. There is no option for it.
    But then:

> Some stuff is tied to framerate and boss fights are much harder when played above 60fps

If there's a FPS cap of 60 how is the quoted text happening?
    What other framerate limit would you set? A limit of 120 would clearly be unnecessary since it's already capped at 60.
>Oh god please, why havent these companies learned from the original Dark Souls 1 PC release? Or DS2 before Scholars for that matter.

You.. You know this game before darksouls 1 right? And that you can't just magically change the game engine from connecting logic to framerate?
    > You.. You know this game before darksouls 1 right?

Well this game comes out tomorrow, in 2021. Its a remake, with substantial changes, one of them should have been this frame rate nonsense.

> And that you can't just magically change the game engine from connecting logic to framerate?

Then explain what happened with dark souls 2, where the base game had this issue and others, then the DLC came out and they fixed it? Shit, even emulators running BoTW on PC have unlinked framerates and engine features like speed for the sake of fidelity, and they didnt even develop the game.
    This is remake and not original old game. Improvements like higher framerate should be expected not excused. If they want to charge $60+ for PC port then put some effort into it.
Listened to the soundtrack today and the first recommended video was a video about the endings with spoilers in the thumbnail. So damn frustrating.
Problem is the amount of recommendations and Stream titles with major spoilers, and auto run streams in guide websites like Fextralife.

Also thats why i said i was going to avoid major streamers so i dont spoil the game. :)
> Huh? They're not spoiling anything. If you go to someone's stream when they're playing a game you're spoiling it for yourself.

Meanwhile if you go on Youtube after so much as even thinking of clicking on a trailer 5 years ago, you can expect videos with Thumbnails and/or Titles showing major plot/ending events showing up in your recommended feed for the next month or so.
The "awfulness" of the controls in the original were absurdly overblown.
    As someone who just played through the original and finished it yesterday, agreed.  People just wanted another God of War, probly.
Absolutely right. Reviewers willingly ignored a *lot* with that, up to and including how they weren't offered the console versions, to comply with the NDA. Let's not forget it was floating in the 90s on the day the embargo lifted.
Well, if they make another of these games, perhaps they should inject some of that quirkiness a little earlier.
    It's a long setup to subvert player's expectations. It works sometimes, but it really expects you to hold on and wait for weird stuff to happen.

The third playthrough of Automata's is absolutely brilliant and the highest point of the game, but even then it takes some two or three awful hours to go through and during that time you also have to deal with some of the worst things in the game, and that's after you already sunk a lot of time in the first two playthroughs (The second being legendarily bad, in my honest opinion). It's really frustrating, but it's a game for people who really want to experience things that are not in any other games.

Hell, one of my favorite games is Pathologic and that game is a misery simulator, so I do know the feeling. If you really aren't into in that postmodernist payoff - which, to be honest, might just not be your thing. FF7R was *not* my thing. Dark Souls is *not* my thing. Persona 5 just *isn't* my thing. I'm not trying to make you look like *you just don't get it* - this probably isn't very interesting.

If anything, the real value of the game (I found the plot fairly mundane) is its experimental nature, and games like these are few and far between, hence why fans hold these in high praises.

Personally I like weird games and imaginative monsters design and that seems to be hiding somewhere in this game. It's not really all that deep for me.
        > It's really frustrating, but it's a game for people who really want to experience things that are not in any other games.
>

I could kinda see a glimmer of that in the game. For example, I accidentally triggered Ending 'K' by eating the fish in the desert, and that was odd but funny, and I liked that. So I know what you mean, and I appreciate things like that too. I'm not adverse to experimental games myself, I freaking love Death Stranding for example and it seemed like a lot of gamers didn't care for that one. I like trying new things, but Automata just didn't click for me personally. Like you said, it's a long setup to wait for the good stuff, and while I am a patient person I simply have less interest in it after slogging through the first playthrough.

> FF7R was not my thing. Dark Souls is not my thing. Persona 5 just isn't my thing.

I am currently playing the original FF7 before I try the remake, but I liked the demo. I have not played any of the Persona games, but they have piqued my interest. Dark Souls however I am a *huge* fan of, so maybe that says something about me as a gamer.
Because there's *something* underneath the aspects I didn't like that's inspired and good. If they made the rest of the game a little more interesting where it counted, it could've changed my opinion of it tremendously. So a complete remake of the first game had potential to do that, but according to the reviews it's apparently quite similar to Automata in all the ways I didn't like. Even the GameSpot review gave it a 9/10 while calling it bad in some ways (my emphasis added):

> It's great that this game, which is a bit hard to get a hold of nowadays, has been faithfully recreated, faults and all. But you can't overlook how its dated aspects--even by 2010 standards--make for an antiquated experience. This means that, as a whole, **gameplay is more of a vehicle for Nier Replicant's story**, and the act of playing it puts some of its key narrative themes into important context.
>
> **This game tests your patience** but the payoff is immense. It's worth jumping through the necessary hoops in order to see every aspect of Nier Replicant's various conclusions. You just wouldn't get the full picture otherwise, and the full picture is wholly satisfying.
>
>"Endings" is a bit of a misnomer with regards to Nier. Subsequent playthroughs help recontextualize what you've seen before, offering additional crucial perspectives. This approach is valuable for the narrative style and messaging of Nier, as **it utilizes repetition** to communicate some affecting themes. Re-experiencing chunks of the game means the series of events are familiar, so the additional context captures your undivided attention, often leaving you questioning yourself or experiencing a revelation about a particular story beat you initially didn't think much of at first.
>
>Nier Replicant doesn't make you play the entire game over again, **but with a few obtuse requirements, it can wear you down, especially by the time you make it to the third route.** 

They don't make the game sound fun to me. Obviously there's something great underneath the unfun parts, and I wish I could experience that, so I was hoping they'd improve in that regard and apparently it is no different.
2B was typical anime fan service for no real reason, it's just kinda gross.
    It wasn't for no reason, though. Doll-like clothing is sometimes used in anime art to convey an emotionless personality and/or someone abused by others as merely an object. The blindfold (and its eventual removal) is also very significant in the context of the story.

Fans were inevitably going to exploit the style, and the creators leaned into that, but it was definitely not for no real reason. And I'm the kind of person who can't stand it when people say "it was intentional" to justify bad design.
        It's literally for no reason except for having the character be sexually appealing, as per Yoko Taro interviews though lmao.  This is on par with excusing Quiet's character design because "She breathes through her skin!!!"
Yeah, the whole french maid vibe looked dumb. Still kinda think it is, but it grew on me.
As someone who played it to completion on release, the gameplay was kinda awful.

Big gameplay flaws :

* The combat was very weak when compared with contemporaries like Kingdom Hearts.

* The side quests consisted almost entirely of mundane kill x of a specific monster fetch quests

* The weapon upgrade system amounted to grinding one room in one dungeon for tens of hours for one rare drop that was needed in everything.

* Fishing.

Sure there was story, but even at the time of playing, the weight of the poor gameplay was palpable and caused the experience to be a total slog.

That doesn't even speak to the technical issues that resulted in huge spikes of lag and frame drops everywhere. 

I don't care how compelling the story was; the game deserved a 7/10. And honestly, you were drip fed so little of it at any given time that it was hard to piece it all together against the gameplay. I ended up just reading summaries on gamefaqs after beating it all to have it one place.
    I played the game to completion on release as well and I fully agree with this. I have found memories of the story but I remember kinda hating the janky combat. I also remember discovering a spear-dash into dodge-roll combo that basically broke the entire combat system because it let you do hit-and-run attacks while being almost untouchable so you didn't need to bother learning enemy attack patterns anymore.

Honestly my very first concern when I heard about the remaster was to pray that they fix the combat system because as much as love Nier, I'm not willing to replay it again unless the gameplay is improved.
        it feels much better. magic and melee is woven together way more smoothly, and although the combos don't have anything on automata ( makes sense. these aren't combat androids ) it's definitely an enjoyable experience this time.
Twilight princess came out nearly 6 years before iirc
    Plot twist: They are talking about >!The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds that launched in 2013!<

>!I'm joking!<

>!Unless...!<
Nah TP was supposed to be another OOT-like(a somber, at times quite dark game whos original release even included bleeding enemies during combat & some cutscenes) and it was a direct reaction to the spaceworld Zelda demo showcasing the potential of the GC. The demo was done in OOT/MM like artstyle and people expected a return to form for the Zelda franchise after MM(3.3 million sales) failed to sell as much as OOT(7.6m). 

Later on Nintendo revealed the next zelda with a childrens cartoon aesthetic the opposite of OOTs at times dark and more realistic style. The fan reaction... was not pretty. WW(4.4m) didn't sell so much either, TP became the next game in development and it garnered massive hype throughout its dev cycle. TP ended selling so much it broke franchise records selling 8.8 million units.
I think there's a big difference between a movie that lasts between 90 and 180 minutes, and a game that could take 30-40 hours, especially when you've gotta get a review out on deadline. There's a certain point, I think for me it's about 5 hours into a game like this, where it's totally reasonable to bail if you're not hooked.
    well sure, but thats if you're not a reviewer.   


im sorry but I could never trust a reviewer that bails on a 40 hour game 5 hours in unless its just absolutely terrible or not fun.   


if you try to review a 40 hour game that you've only played 5 hours of, you shouldnt be reviewing it at all. maybe it can be part of a smaller segment where you give your two cents, but a full review? I dont know if thats fair. 

but I do think there there are exceptions. for example girlfriend reviews recently did a video on persona 5. that game can run any where from 60 to 200 hours of game play depending on how much you try to do. Persona 5 is, I think for day one reviewers anyway, a hard game to review for because its so damn long. That said, they did mention that they were going to finish the game and if I recall correctly provide a follow up. But they did get a good way through it, I even saw them playing on twitch at a part of the game that takes like any where from 20 to 60 hours to get to so they definitely saw more than the first 5% of the game.   


I just think for a FULL proper review of any given game, you gotta see the story out to the end at least.
        If a game isnt fun in the first 5 hours it's a bad game, sorry.  Why would I want to slog through 5 or 10 hours of boredom for it to maybe get good when there are fun games I can play instead?

Reviewers should finish games but for the opposite reason, to identify if games just use cheap tricks to make you think its good in the demo but with no satisfying story or endgame
For me, if the game isnt good within the first 30 minutes then I'm not going to keep playing. Time is a valuable resource to me, and I like to think most people feel the same.
    I don't really think that's a viable rule to follow for most RPGs tbh
        I think it matters for any game. It's not about everything being great but if there's nothing that hooks you in the first 30-60 minutes why keep wasting your time?

It can be anything, graphics, combat, dialogues, voice acting, anything really but there has to be something compelling and this will be different for each person and each game.
        Most games rely on a loop of actions. If I'm not enjoying the loop then it's probably just not for me.
Having just replayed both nier and drakengard 3 on ps3, holy mother of god D3’s performance was genuinely baffling. I have no idea how it got released in that state. Nier was great :)
    Honestly, Saying the frame rate was trash was being generous

And this is coming from someone who lord the game and the franchise.
I'm playing on PS5 I haven't had any issues so far, just my personal experience
    Complaints come from PC gamers, which have been already been burned by Automata's horrible PC port.
I can’t imagine skipping a classic because you can’t play it above 60fps.
    Hell, I highly doubt the original was playing at 60fps to begin with. So, it's definitely not a good reason to pan this game.
        You're right. Gestalt was 30 FPS max (besides emulation hacks), and it sometimes went into the teens: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmYONPPAag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmYONPPAag)
        The original was not a PC game, came out during the 360/PS3 era where games had awful sub 30fps framerate and was a low budget title made by a subpar dev team(ignoring Taro's talent).

This is a PC game following up an incredibly successful game that sold 5.5million units being released in the year of flying cars: 2021. Not at all comparable.
    A game locked at 30fps might give me pause, but anything over 60fps is more of a luxury for most games. Over 120hz I genuinely can't tell the difference most of the time.
        It might be a case of getting used to something, I have been playing pc games on 4K for the past 2 years, and playing a game at 1080p feels like I'm playing on 144p. I never played on 144hz but from what I hear it's hard to go back. (Not that I think its a reason to ignore a classic game like this, hell, bloodborne is locked to 30 and I will forever recommend it)
            I agree, but I think there's probably a point with framerate where you hit diminishing returns. Like, from 30-60 is a world of difference, but 60-144 is felt less in games with without twitchy camera movements, and 144-240hz even less so. For me, I don't see any difference over 144hz even in shooters.
                The difference between 60 to 144 is like 38fps vs 60fps (frame time wise); still a very noticeable difference and hard to go back to. Not sure about 240hz+ though
            I guess it depends on the person, but I have no problem playing games even at 30 fps after experiencing 144 Hz. Over time I realized that cosistent frame times are far more important to me than frame rate (ideally I'd want both of course). Also, VRR is a godsend, especially on displays over 60 Hz.
            I think the 144hz argument is only true for some game types. Yeah playing something that requires fast reaction times like a FPS will definitely feel worse if you're under 144FPS. But I can can go back to skyrim and not really feel any worse with its locked framerate.
    Right? Who are these people?
        PC gamers.
        I see melodramatic comments like that on here all the time that get pretty good reception. I just chalk it up to the extremists of an already fringe community. Most normal people really don't give a shit.
You're right, 60FPS is fine. What isn't fine is that animations are tied to the framerate. This has been a big no-no in games for over the past decade. If your framerate goes above or below 60fps weird things can start to happen.

>There are no options for VSync and framerate limit, which is important because running it above 60fps speeds Replicant’s animations up, making boss fights much harder than they should be. A regular stutter, which seems to be linked to a controller issue on Steam, is equally annoying – mine would periodically disconnect during these stutters...

PC gamers should probably wait for Digital Foundry to release an analysis on the game.
    Tying gameplay to framerate is dubious programming but not unheard of.  But tying gameplay to framerate without limiting the framerate is just trolling.
    Breath of the wild did it

It's 2021, that shit isn't really acceptable anymore.
    I could not give less of a shit about a framerate so long as it runs at 60fps, but the point I'm making is if it's locked to 60 then you can't exactly complain that it functions incorrectly above 60. That's the same criticism twice.
    Dude it runs at 60 fps. I have everything I would need to run it at 144hz 1440p but I don't care.

These are technical hurdled imposed by time, you gotta know when things are big enough to justify the work to rework the engine and events
        Agreed. It's wild to think that many games were stuck at 30fps on the generation of consoles that *just* ended, and people are already treating 120fps as mandatory instead of a luxury.
            no better way to get developers to raise their standards of output quickly, though.
    [deleted]
        Yeah really. If I can go up over 60 that's awesome I love extra high fps, but 60 solid is the goal and 144 is brownie points.
        [deleted]
            [deleted]
    Imagine skipping a masterpiece because 60fps isn't enough. Lmfao
Absolutely. The combat was serviceable, and that's all it needed to be.

I think I still like Automata more overall, but that's completely from a taste/personal preference. I don't think I could make any kind of argument as to Automata being an objective improvement but rather just an expansion of some of the ideas in the original.

Both are absolutely some of my favorite games ever.
    When I saw that Platinum was attached to Automata I screamed an internal “fuck yes” because Nier already had the Yoko Taro and Okabe secret sauce. Pair that with Platinum’s flair and you get one of my favorite games ever too, in nearly every aspect.
        Did you guys like the combat in Automata? I was really excited about Platinum being involved and I loved the game overall, but I found the combat sub par. I hate how the optimal way to play is to hold in the shoot button at all times.
            Again, I think it's serviceable. I think it's better than the original Nier's combat, but it's nothing all that special. I appreciate that it's non-intrusive. I know platinum excels at intricate combat systems but I appreciate that Nier Automata isn't quite as in-depth as a Bayonetta or what have you.
            I'm not far in, but that's probably my one thing. I don't like having to hold down the trigger *forever*.
                >I'm not far in,

Get off this subreddit before you see spoilers!
                    No >:D
                It gets old really fast and it's even worse on higher difficulties when you take insane dmg at close range and thus has to rely more on range attacks to kill spongey enemies. Automata is one of those games were I kind of regret not going for the easy mode.
                    As someone who just finished route A on hard, I almost never had to use my ranged attack, like at all (except the ship part of course).

EDIT: Oh, I think the only time I used ranged attack is against the centipede in the castle.
                        I think they're saying the held the trigger down the entire time they were in combat while using the melee attacks. 

If I remember right, there's an option to just toggle it on and off. Either that or the attack was so weak I just didn't bother with it anyway. I know I wasn't holding the trigger down the entire time.
            It’s definitely Platinum’s weaker ones, but it’s still pretty slick, flashy and badass which I love.
            I would go so far to say the combat is substanceless. The game has great aesthetics, themes and character performances, but the one thing holding back is... its gameplay
                Definitely disagree with you there. IMO the big pitfall of automatas combat is just that it rewards certain mashable strategies, but if you really learn the intricacies of the combat it’s absolutely not completely lacking of substance. You can be pretty creative when you know what to do, [like this guy does.](https://youtu.be/d3Eh0jbddmk)

I understand your point of view though because instead of all that flashy stuff you *could* just spam evade and sprinting heavy attack. But i believe they just wanted to make the game very easily accessible. If you want to take the combat to the next level, you can.
            I started enjoying it quite a bit after replaying the game on Very Hard. Learning how to control groups and isolate enemies with extended juggles by using animation cancels made the experience much more satisfying, as did actually learning boss attack patterns. It's not the best combat system out there, but it's more than just serviceable in my opinion. 

Although, the game certainly is at fault if dying in one hit is the only way it can make me learn attack patterns. Healing is way too forgiving and powerful enemies should have some level scaling.
            it had good animation and sound design (putting it above most other action RPGs) but you could basically mash your way through everything and dodging was easy. It was also really easy to break the RPG side to trivialize things further. It's no DMC or Bayonetta but still fun.
            Automata's combat was pretty shallow especially for Platinum but I didn't really tire of it until a couple of playthroughs in. I honestly can't remember if I played it on hard or very hard but a lot of things (especially in the early game) practically one-shot me so combat became a kind of hokey cokey dance of dipping in and out, spinning around (i.e. spamming dodge). Once I got a feel for it I actually really enjoyed it, had its own rhythm and its beautifully animated. I liked it enough to go out of my way to make it look as flashy as possible (sliding about on sand was a particular favourite of mine), which helped make up for the lack of depth to a point.
            The level scaling and instant healing are both busted as well. The former makes it a complete slog to kill anything significantly higher level than you, while the latter makes anything that isn't a one hit kill almost meaningless.

Combat looks cool and the characters are fun to control, but the actual combat design is awful.
>  It really is THAT good and I think from a narrative standpoint it is a bit better than Automata as well.

Both the narrative and the characters were better than Automata
    Debatable. 

Automata had better VA performances, and emotions.

But to a character like Kainé, 9S/2B/A2 don't hold a candle.

Overall, Automata is superior though.
        > 
> Automata had better VA performances, and emotions.

VA performance don't really impact on whether a character is better or not though, that's just production stuff. And Kaine VA > all of Automata.

>Overall, Automata is superior though.

It was the more well rounded game. It had better pacing and combat, while still having a solid story. But Gestalt will always be way more of a memorable game for me, in big part because Automata's android characters just didn't hit the same way as emil/kaine/weiss
Also, Platinum Games made Automata. It's not even necessary to watch a gameplay to know that a game made by them will have a great frenetic, fast paced, fun combat. Everyone expects that. Can't say the same about Cavia, who *was* known for its... anime games?
The original NieR was largely brown and its starring dude did look like he eats steroids for breakfast.
    Yeah, Papa NieR only exists because Yoko Taro was trying to appeal to the west. Fat lot of good that did. If we're being honest though, the main "problem" with NieR was that it was a Japanese game that didn't fit in into the traditional mold.
        And video game reviewers are on average kind of shit at reviewing narratives.
        I still prefer Papa Nier compared to Brother Nier just on the basis that I like the narrative of a father saving their child more than a sibling saving them ... Both are still great however
Nier was all of that, minus the gun. It was ignored because it was grindy as fuck and the gameplay was ass.
    I don’t think you can blame the Ending C and D grind since most reviewers probably didn’t even get there.
The best part of the remake to me is definitely that all the people that missed it originally, because it fell under the radar, get to experience one of the most memorable games I can think of
Those people never played Drakengard
    I'm watching and longplay and what the fuck and why on earth.

It does look like mediocre gameplay with an interesting plot but it's just so weird.
        Its a really bizarre game that the secret ending leads into Nier. Its set up like a Dynasty Warriors game but the entire game, the music, the graphics, the gameplay, the story are all designed to make you paranoid and agitated.
            I can see that regarding eveyrthing but the gameplay. It just looks mindless as hell, like a Dynasty Warriors game without the spectacular. Kinda like the first Onechambara.

Then it all goes to what in the fuck land in the final third. I'm kinda glad for these games longplays are a thing. Due to a lack of hardware I can't really play these games right now (man I'd love if Sony gave a shit about BC for these kind of games. Also Valkyrie Profile), but at least I can see and somehow know what are they about.

Seriously that ending with the **Spoiler:** >!flying demonic babies!<. I saw that years ago somehow and thought it was a nightmare I had, and even when I started looking into Taro's games I had an idea this was it and could not figure out how it ended up like that.
                "It just looks mindless as hell" - yeah that sounds pretty unnerving and agitating since you dont need to think and all you hear is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NocSlsBJHxY&ab_channel=Durandana
                    [deleted]
I'm not saying its a perfect game, it had plenty of flaws. But if you compare to every other game that has a 68 meta score....

It got done poorly mostly because it was a JRPG coming out at that time, and because it wasn't big budget
> The voice acting was just okay

Sorry, but you're crazy.
    That I think it’s just okay? Should I have thought it was better? Because I have my OG copy of the game and the voice acting was just alright. Not bad by any means, but wasn’t exactly top tier by any means either.  
  
At the time, it was just standard anime voice actors. If that floats your boat, that’s totally cool. But it wasn’t top tier
        Nah the voice acting is some of the best of the time.
            Considering all the other games of 2010, I think that’s definitely up for debate and likely in regards to whether you prefer dub anime voice actors or not, but I am by no means crazy for finding the voice acting to just be okay. “Okay” isn’t bad.
        You're fine to have your opinions. But by and large the voice acting in OG Nier is considered to be phenomenal and its voice cast is stacked as fuck by today's standards. Like you really gonna say a game with Jameson Price and Laura Bailey as the main cast has bad voice acting?

Again you're welcome to have your opinion, but recognize that a majority of people disagree with your opinion and future success of the voice actors points to them being talented. Not saying you're wrong, just saying most people would think you're wrong.
            Considering how poorly the first game sold and reviewed, I don’t think it’s crazy find the voice acting as just okay. Again, I never said it was bad. Not once. “Okay” does not equal “Bad”. It just means “Okay”. Those two people don’t suddenly make the voice acting anymore fantastic. Again, they’re just anime voice actors and they aren’t bad by any means, but aren’t exactly setting the world on fire with their performances in OG Nier either. Never said they weren’t talented. Never said they were bad. Just that the overall voice acting of the game is just okay and somewhat par the course for a lot of JRPGs of the time.  
  
Please, understand that I’m not saying the voice acting is bad by any means. I’m just saying it wasn’t top tier either and I think that is a completely fair assessment given the overall quality of the game.  
  
There is such an odd defensiveness of OG Nier as if it can’t be stated that the game has flaws. I love OG Nier. I personally find it fantastic, but there is a very clear reason why it wasn’t widely viewed as a big deal at launch. And that’s okay
                Out of interest, what games would you consider to have top-tier voice acting, particularly from the same period? I thought Nier's was pretty great (Kaine and Weiss at least), but I haven't played a ton of games.
                No. Didn't you hear them? You need to have their opinion because it's a popular one!!! Everyone would disagree! etc
                > Again, they’re just anime voice actors

Anime voice actors is just a weird term to use, because tons of voice actors do tons of things. You're differentiating anime voice actors from...what? Voice actors who only do animated shows and movies? If you look at most big name voice actors in games, they probably have some anime on their backlog. In fact, a ton probably do. 

Take The Last of Us, which is probably the furthest you could get from anime, plenty of the main voice actors there have done plenty of anime. Troy Baker voices Joel but did anime for like 10 years before he even got the part. Laura Bailey voices Abby in TLoU2 and has also done a ton of anime, in addition to being Kaine. But they didn't just do anime, they were doing a wide variety of other video games too: western games and Japanese games both. 

That's not to say you can't have your opinion or that it's invalid, I just don't think "anime voice actors" is even really all that useful a distinction. Almost all working video game VAs, including the ones in Nier, do a mix of anime, American cartoons, Western video games, and Japanese video games.
> And the story, atleast intro-wise, was just kind of standard,

If you don't finish a game, you shouldn't review it

/edit suggesting Professional paid critics should finish a game before reviewing it is controversial? The fuck is this subs sometimes?
    If you state you didn't finish the game and exactly why I think a review is totally fine. You might miss out on part of what makes a game something special but then the reader and either write it off altogether or seek out another review to decide if it's worth it. 

Especially with a game like Nier - it finishes stronger than it starts narratively but vastly worse gameplay-wise, and if nothing up front in the first ten or so hours catches someone's interest enough to put up with its worse aspects, it's unlikely anything in the last ten hours will make up for that.
        > If you state you didn't finish the game and exactly why

Isn't Nier the game where the [reviewer gave up after the game told him to catch a fish and didn't explain that no, you needed the fish from over THERE](https://www.engadget.com/2010-05-03-nier-review-fail.html).
            yup yup. the part my guy Juice there leaves out is that the instructions for how to fish in the game are also incorrect, so a reviewer would just have to fuck around until it worked before they even get around to figuring out there's somewhere else to fish.
        And it's not like a game can't do it better while delivering the same themes. Nier Automata proves that decisively. Enjoyable gaming experience right from the get-go, and narratively engaging at the start. Of course, it's really in ending C-E where it reaches its amazing apex, but even without those endings, it would still be a quality experience.
    Even if you finish the whole game, it's valid to critique how long the game takes to get good. Most people aren't going to go through hours of mediocre gameplay and basic story just to get to the good part.
    I disagree. Not wanting to completely finish a game is a valid reaction, after all.

Let's take it to the logical extreme: imagine how warped the reviews would be if BotW only got reviewed by people who gathered all 900 Korok seeds. It would basically filter out everyone except the most hardcore players who just so happened to be most compatible with that particular game!

Games *can* be experienced without achieving some arbitrary measure of completeness. Reviews should reflect that basic truth. If a reviewer couldn't stomach finishing a game, *you bet* that I would want to know that. I want a review that actually represents the reviewer's individual experience with the game, not a fruitless attempt at assigning something as nebulous as artistic value or intrinsic worth.
    I don't think it applies with this game.

I love NieR:A. One of my favorite games of all time.

That said. I wouldn't recommend it to most people. The beginning of the game drags way too long and is the worst aspect of the game IMO.

The game doesn't really pick up story-wise till after you 'beat the game' once.

I dropped the game once before getting to the parts I really liked.

Guess my point is I think its totally valid for someone to burn out on one of these games before completing it especially because they quite literally demand you to replay the game over again before really seeing significant progress in the story.
    Right, but the game doesn’t start to truly standout until it’s latter half. Even for as good as the endings and really last half of the story is, the intro is still pretty standard and wasn’t exactly enticing a wide range of people at the time. You have to play the first half to get to the fantastic last half story, but if it’s a bit of a slog to get there, that’s going to affect the overall opinion of the game. The endings of the game, for as great as they are, didn’t make up for the rest of the game that was already rather lackluster for its time.  
  
And I say this as someone who loves original Nier
    Why? I don't have to finish a bad meal to know I'm not going to enjoy it. If a movie isn't grabbing me an hour in I'm not gonna lose sleep over giving it 1 star on Letterboxd. Why should I have to play every single minute of a video game before being able to leave a review?
        You shouldn't ever have to play through the entire game for a review, just as long as you let the reader know you didn't finish it in the article. That way, they can make an informed decision about whether the review is useful or not.
    I wonder how many reviewers even knew how to get the true ending. All weapons is somewhat of a chore, even if NG+ runs are quick.
        Getting all the weapons isnt too bad and it isnt like Drakengard where you have to max them all out
            >Getting all the weapons isnt too bad 

That's quite a understatement, heh. You could miss out on some of them in first half of game without a guide and after halfway point, you were pretty much softlocked unless you chose to restart over all way from the beginning.
                There are no missable weapons in Nier. You can get every single weapon at the very end of the game.
                    Weird, I recalled just giving up after reading some guide mentioning I missed some quests with weapon rewards.
                        Nope, there is only 1 weapon that you can "miss" by not doing a sidequest and that weapon can be bought at a shop for a period of time after the "timeskip". So if you miss it on your first playthrough, when you start at the midway point during your second you can go buy it.
Nier is just a spin-off to drakengard.
> if you want to be yelled at by a glorious trash monster every time you boot up the game

Turns out I would very much like to get yelled at by a glorious trash monster, huh.
And Replicant is "OG Nier" just updated?
    The more accurate/complicated answer is that there were two versions of OG NieR in Japan - NieR Replicant (PS3) and NieR Gestalt (Xbox 360).

NieR Replicant had a young protagonist (brother trying to save his sister); NieR Gestalt had an older protagonist (father trying to save his daughter). Other than that, they're the same game.

But Replicant didn't get localized in the West, only Gestalt did, and they dropped the subtitle since there was only one version - so the North American game "NieR" is NieR Gestalt, with the "father" protagonist (and it got released on PS3 as well in the West, unlike in Japan).

This game is an updated remaster of NieR Replicant, the version with the "brother" protagonist that we never got in the West.

    I was on PS4 and I had loads of little bugs here and there, the Kind that makes you laugh rather than impacting it badly though. My personal favourite was my weapon getting stuck spinning around all over the place like Joel is a magician.
        Sorry but I don’t think this is common
And will probably never be fixed if Automata is anything to go by.
    They're working on a patch for Automata right now. Unless you're aware of that and implying it'll never come out.
        Wow already? That was fast. Can't believe it only took them 4 years.
        Took them 4 years, you wanna wait 4 years for all their PC ports to potentially get fixed? 

While they're at it, maybe they should upgrade from ps2/3 era graphics fidelity.
            You realize this is a remaster of a ps3 game from 2010 right? Maybe you should look up a graphics comparison video if you think it’s ps3 era.
If they dont want us to play their game is their problem, i pass buying games that devs didn't gave a single fuck to make the pc version at least working...
Not OP, but you’ll find that sentiment to be common among the pc gaming community.

There’s already more good games coming out than most people have time to play, no point spending that time playing games or supporting devs that have poor pc ports. Japanese developers need to get with the times and recognize that it’s a growing platform with millions of people and start caring more about bringing proper ports to the platform
I feel like this is par for the course for online gaming discourse, I understand people are disappointed and unhappy with SE but people need to have some perspective.

    >cum

Zero will violate you, both from and back, all in 60 FPS.
        I want to find that interview where Taro jokingly mentions the difficult frame was to make you feel bad about what was happening because how awful your character was. How hype is the idea that the game itself doesn’t want you to commit game crimes so it’s actively trying to prevent you from going forward. It’s a joke and not reality, but such a funny idea. My favorite are games that when making a choice ask you if you are sure, but then a second window appears right after to go “but, are you really sure?”.
Ah the stories as a whole were pretty good in side-quests for Automata, but I can't argue that they were designed as basic fetch quests and some seemed interested in just wasting your time. 


IIRC side-quests in the first Nier were significantly worse. There are a few standout ones like the Lighthouse sidequest but by and large its just really one-note fetch quests with little story impact. I guess I just find the idea of androids/robots trying to learn what it means to be human and exploring that through side-quests to be a more natural and interesting conceit than just "me hungry get mutton thx".
At this point I am sure they are just parodies of shitty sidequest in other jrpgs.
Uhhh, there was a lot of quality content in the side quests that added a lot to the story. Off the top of my head, I remember one that involved Yorha's executioner models by going deeper into their back stories, and another that went into a whole philosophical concept. How are these bad side quests exactly?
Automata is the same way if you ever play that, don't stop at ending A!
My assumption is similar, although what I'm betting is that the one reviewer that had capped FPS played the game on fullscreen borderless (which caps the game's FPS to the monitor/desktop refresh rate without needing V-Sync), while the other played on "true" fullscreen.
I adore Nier but I'll wait for their video (or someone's in-depth performance analysis) before I pick it up. Don't want to risk buying it only to find out that it has massive frame drops, frame pacing issues, or worse.
    Yep, Automata is one of my fav games (played on release on PS4) but playing it recently on steam it was a buggy mess, just refunded before the two hours, the game pass version is okay but I still had a crash and some drops below 60 unfortunately
    Automata was unplayable to me until I installed FAR.  FAR fixed everything but a really minor frame pacing issue in the open game world.  Played perfect in the actual "zones" though.
I dunno if 'they're fixing automata 4 years after it's initial release, with no patches in between' should be held up as an example that they will fix the game in a timely manner. Especially when the automata patch isn't even out yet. 


From these reviews it seems like Replicant might be less broken (I don't recall whether automata reviews emphasized how shoddy the pc port was), but that doesn't mean it'll get any more post launch attention.
Don’t get your hopes up. They’ll most likely only put the Game Pass version on Steam, that barely fixes anything and call it a day.

If they can’t make a new release work, how could we expect them to fix the old one in any way.
    This, and any fix will break the current FAR mod which will require a mod update.
    Two different dev teams.   Maybe Square will let them patch Replicant where they wouldn't let Platinum, since Plat announced they were working on patches before their involvement ended.
While this is fair in this particular case, a lot of other games still do this and it appears to be a side effect of "make game as fast as possible" not "make game with best practices and future proofing in mind".
It's not "easier to program".

Multipling your value by the frametime is the easiest shit there is, competent devs have been doing it since the late 90s.

There is NO excuse for not doing this nowadays (or 10 years ago for that matter).
I get that, but I don't get why you would do that for PC when the framerate is going to be so variable. I don't imagine it makes no sense in every scenario, but for stuff like animation speed I just don't understand why you would do that for such a variable environment.
    Precisely because it is so variable. Removing the need to account for framerate differences removes a lot of variance you would need to account for. Especially when you design a game primarily for consoles, when porting to PC it simplifies a lot to just force the PC to act like a console.
I think it's extremely unlikely that the PC version is worse than the Series S version (on a sufficiently fast PC).
    Any plans on patching this game for them? :D
    You're absolutely right. Decided to put the console to use though, feel like I'll enjoy the game more on the couch and take my time with it. Can't wait.
Since you're on Xbox, you can [change your system's region to play the game right now.](https://old.reddit.com/r/nier/comments/mvhtvw/to_all_xbox_owners_changing_the_consoles_region/)
    You the man dog. Just made my night look a lot better.
I felt like I knew basically all games that people geniunely feel are their "favourites", its cool to find one I absolutely do not fucking know about.
    Ghost Trick is also available on iOS if I remember correctly. I think that might be how I played it actually... wild, awesome story.
Nope!  Shouldn’t be any difference since PS4 physical should be backwards compatible on the PS5 - and there wasn’t any version tailored for the PS5 so it doesn’t matter for now
    Great news! I love collecting physical games and WalMart usually has games for about $10 cheaper + compatible with PS5. Win-win-win
The achievement list shows that >!Ending E is in the game. Don't know if it's the same one, but regardless there is an Ending E!<
    Oh hell yea, that's great to hear. >!Tbf I wouldn't mind even if it was just an adaptation of the one from the novels. I don't really know the nitty gritty of it besides a TL;DR, and it's been like 4 years since I even read *that*.!<
Quite a lot of  the reviews clearly disliked it for feeling dosjointed and a mishmash of multiple genres, then that became a staple and beloved feature with Automata.

True, the combat wasn't as great, and it was uglier, but I wouldn't say that makes it a 5/10, the characters were much more intriguing than Automatas IMO. It still had a stellar voice cast, an incredible story, great characters, a 10/10 soundtrack, deep and emotional sidestories, one of the most conpelling endings in videogame history, and all in all... the combat wasn't bad, just not a highlight and the progression was actually somewhat addicting... it was never such a poor game.

To be fair, I haven't seen all of the changes, but if a change of combat and a small graphical facelift brings a 5/10 to a 9 - 9.5 / 10, I think there's a lot more at play than simply fixing old issues.
Yep, all the storytelling techniques people loved in Automata originated in this game.
oh i dont know about other countries, but im from argentina, and steam regionalizes prices so it isnt as expensive as a playstation game that you have to pay in dollas plus taxes and shit, sucks but thats the way it is
    Damn, Poland is still $60 on Steam so I've decided to wait for a sale :/

Can't wait for Kaldaien to give us the DRM infused mod we really deserve.
Really, someone else said it was 900p on series x.
If games are works of art, an S-Tier story, characters and OST should elevate a C-tier game to a B score.
Automata is easily my 2nd favourite game of all time, only behind FFX
    ffx fans !
        FFX is also one of my two favorite games of all time. Love that game.
I'm okay with that, I completely, completely cknowledge I didn't finish it in the slightest. It was just the line in the sand for me, and considering I didn't do all the side quests in the first half I also knew I wouldn't be able to get all the endings. 

Playing to "find out more" Also just wasn't an incentive because I didn't really care about the characters or the story. I did end up reading the developments and watching clips though. :) 

I think for me a great, well told story is like the amazing tasty cherry on a great game but the game play needs to come first. If I'm not enjoying the game I'll just play another game and listen to a lore/story telling video on it on YouTube. 

I have now just started a replay of Auto from the start though and seeing Emil and certain details like the dessert robotsmasks that I had forgot about are awesome. So some genuine joy came out of it.
    > I have now just started a replay of Auto from the start though and seeing Emil and certain details like the dessert robotsmasks that I had forgot about are awesome. So some genuine joy came out of it.

Glad it retroactively worked out for you in that sense in enhanced your Nier: A experience. You may appreciate this trove of information at this stage: >![The Ark](https://theark.wiki/w/Welcome).!<
  
 
> and considering I didn't do all the side quests in the first half I also knew I wouldn't be able to get all the endings. 

Just a heads up in case you come back one day you don't need to do all the side quests, just collect all the weapons (though some Part 2 SQs do give weapons). Any weapons missed in Part 1 can be bought in Part 2 from the shops, so you also don't need to sweat that aspect of it.
Yeah... It's such a shame. I get that it's a remake/remaster of an old game but in that case slapping the £50 price tag on it was a bold move.
He's also quoted as stating:

*"Incidentally, the big string of numbers on the end of the title was just something I stuck on randomly, so I wouldn’t think too hard about it if I was you."*

Gotta love the honesty.
Hes doing it as a joke/parody of Kingdom Hearts' shitty numbering system. If youve never played a YokoTaro game, they are all full of gags and parodies of other shit
Imo it still falls in the Kingdom Hearts territory. It is needlessly complicated and when showed off on a website makes it seem like the listing is broken if you don't already know the game's name
    pretty sure Yoko Taro did that on purpose. he's an edgy guy and it's funny. most people will call it the Nier Replicant remake/remaster and it won't be confusing
        Nier Replicant alone sorta works too since the old one is called Gestalt, and to casual fans this is just a brand new prequel anyway.
    [deleted]
        We're talking about game titles here, not the story
No it doesn't? The KH names make much more sense than that.
what? every single KH name makes sense and has a meaning. this narrative about KH being overly complicated is so overblown at this point
    Look I'll be the first to defend the plot of KH as not being all that complicated, but names like " Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover", "Kingdom Hearts 0.2: Birth by Sleep – A Fragmentary Passage", and "Kingdom Hearts Unchained χ/Kingdom Hearts Union χ[Cross]/Kingdom Hearts Union χ Dark Road" are just nonsense.
Yeah, pretty sure i heard the combat was redone from scratch too.
Yes Taro is eccentric but that doesnt mean he lies about shit. He is always very open on development problems that his team run into and budget constraints that he has had to work with. 

Him saying this not a real remake is very much a serious comment made to make sure than fan expectations are grounded. 

Him calling it ver1.22474487139... is him being eccentric and having fun with it.

They are two different aspects of the same person.
    I'm not saying he's lying. I'm saying his perceptions of his own work can be skewed, and that can affect the way he assesses them. In particular, I've picked up on some higher levels of humility and self-doubt when he discusses his work, which could absolutely affect this exact scenario.
        I get what you are trying to say. Taro loves self depreciating. But the "this is not a full remake" is not one of those. It's not just Taro the entire team stated that as a very matter of fact thing. 

As someone who 100% OG NieR, I can tell you this is the same game. They have very clearly shown the part they remade like the core combat and what parts they left exactly the same. Like the environments and stuff. Most of the environment assets arent even remade just upscaled and further polished and the team confirmed that. If people are going in expecting a brand new experience, this is not it. It's gonna feel slightly dated because at its core it is still a low budget ps3 jrpg.
Also, Nier Automata itself was not broken. It wasn't a good port but it worked. I played it on PC and finished all the main endings. That guy is being dramatic.
    > It wasn't a good port but it worked

For some people.  I bought it on release and never got it working properly on my 770 even with the FAR mod, and I heard similar stories for other people with 700 series cards.  Reinstalled it later when I got a 1080 and it ran fine.
        Yeah it specifically hated the architecture that the 700 and 960 and below ran on.
    I would call crashing every 30 min is broken.
    [deleted]
        These issues only popped up for some people, through multiple systems I've had zero issues other than the framerate which isn't something I completely care about.  
Game never crashed, never had any issue with resolution, had online on for the entire game and multiple playthroughs without issue and this was all at launch with a pc that was pretty standard at the time (i5 4690k, 290x, 16GB DDR3) and still now with a much beefier pc I've had zero issues with the PC version (i9 9900k, 64GB DDR4, RTX 3090)
        Can't say I noticed or experienced all of those. Framerate issues yes. I don't really have a good eye for resolution so if it was the case it didn't bother me. Don't recall getting a CTD but I might be misremembering. Also my rig would have been pretty beefy at the time so might have factored in.

I would never consider watching someone else play a game as a replacement for me playing it. Different strokes, I guess.
            That's all fine, but yeah, Automata was *rough* on release.

I personally dealt with the Resolution issues, Lighting Issues/Artifacts, CTD's, and other things.  Still, I loved the game.
People have to cap themselves at 60fps. It is not like the game provided an option to cap framerate or tell people to do it.
In Automata the B and C runs are a good bit different from the initial A playthrough, but I understand the concept is the same and a lot of B run is similar to A. 

C on the other hand is a whole new playthrough in Automata.
You don't replay through the same game again in Automata. Route C picks up from where route A&B left off. It's entirely new. And only about half of route B is a replay of route A.

In Replicant, you replay through the entire game each time. There are of course some minor differences, but the only one I remember is an extra cut scene near the end.
That's my biggest gripe of the game. I never played B or C but I heard C and beyond is amazing. I didn't even enjoy route A that much so I was never compelled to play B. Feels very tedious imo.
It does.
Oh trust me it turns into a whole other game shortly after where you stopped.
    That's what I've heard but I was too burned out to push through. I'm glad so many people love it but it just isn't my type of game.

But then:

> Some stuff is tied to framerate and boss fights are much harder when played above 60fps

If there's a FPS cap of 60 how is the quoted text happening?
What other framerate limit would you set? A limit of 120 would clearly be unnecessary since it's already capped at 60.
> You.. You know this game before darksouls 1 right?

Well this game comes out tomorrow, in 2021. Its a remake, with substantial changes, one of them should have been this frame rate nonsense.

> And that you can't just magically change the game engine from connecting logic to framerate?

Then explain what happened with dark souls 2, where the base game had this issue and others, then the DLC came out and they fixed it? Shit, even emulators running BoTW on PC have unlinked framerates and engine features like speed for the sake of fidelity, and they didnt even develop the game.
This is remake and not original old game. Improvements like higher framerate should be expected not excused. If they want to charge $60+ for PC port then put some effort into it.
As someone who just played through the original and finished it yesterday, agreed.  People just wanted another God of War, probly.
It's a long setup to subvert player's expectations. It works sometimes, but it really expects you to hold on and wait for weird stuff to happen.

The third playthrough of Automata's is absolutely brilliant and the highest point of the game, but even then it takes some two or three awful hours to go through and during that time you also have to deal with some of the worst things in the game, and that's after you already sunk a lot of time in the first two playthroughs (The second being legendarily bad, in my honest opinion). It's really frustrating, but it's a game for people who really want to experience things that are not in any other games.

Hell, one of my favorite games is Pathologic and that game is a misery simulator, so I do know the feeling. If you really aren't into in that postmodernist payoff - which, to be honest, might just not be your thing. FF7R was *not* my thing. Dark Souls is *not* my thing. Persona 5 just *isn't* my thing. I'm not trying to make you look like *you just don't get it* - this probably isn't very interesting.

If anything, the real value of the game (I found the plot fairly mundane) is its experimental nature, and games like these are few and far between, hence why fans hold these in high praises.

Personally I like weird games and imaginative monsters design and that seems to be hiding somewhere in this game. It's not really all that deep for me.
    > It's really frustrating, but it's a game for people who really want to experience things that are not in any other games.

I could kinda see a glimmer of that in the game. For example, I accidentally triggered Ending 'K' by eating the fish in the desert, and that was odd but funny, and I liked that. So I know what you mean, and I appreciate things like that too. I'm not adverse to experimental games myself, I freaking love Death Stranding for example and it seemed like a lot of gamers didn't care for that one. I like trying new things, but Automata just didn't click for me personally. Like you said, it's a long setup to wait for the good stuff, and while I am a patient person I simply have less interest in it after slogging through the first playthrough.

> FF7R was not my thing. Dark Souls is not my thing. Persona 5 just isn't my thing.

I am currently playing the original FF7 before I try the remake, but I liked the demo. I have not played any of the Persona games, but they have piqued my interest. Dark Souls however I am a *huge* fan of, so maybe that says something about me as a gamer.
It wasn't for no reason, though. Doll-like clothing is sometimes used in anime art to convey an emotionless personality and/or someone abused by others as merely an object. The blindfold (and its eventual removal) is also very significant in the context of the story.

Fans were inevitably going to exploit the style, and the creators leaned into that, but it was definitely not for no real reason. And I'm the kind of person who can't stand it when people say "it was intentional" to justify bad design.
    It's literally for no reason except for having the character be sexually appealing, as per Yoko Taro interviews though lmao.  This is on par with excusing Quiet's character design because "She breathes through her skin!!!"
I played the game to completion on release as well and I fully agree with this. I have found memories of the story but I remember kinda hating the janky combat. I also remember discovering a spear-dash into dodge-roll combo that basically broke the entire combat system because it let you do hit-and-run attacks while being almost untouchable so you didn't need to bother learning enemy attack patterns anymore.

Honestly my very first concern when I heard about the remaster was to pray that they fix the combat system because as much as love Nier, I'm not willing to replay it again unless the gameplay is improved.
    it feels much better. magic and melee is woven together way more smoothly, and although the combos don't have anything on automata ( makes sense. these aren't combat androids ) it's definitely an enjoyable experience this time.
Plot twist: They are talking about >!The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds that launched in 2013!<

>!I'm joking!<

>!Unless...!<
well sure, but thats if you're not a reviewer.   


im sorry but I could never trust a reviewer that bails on a 40 hour game 5 hours in unless its just absolutely terrible or not fun.   


if you try to review a 40 hour game that you've only played 5 hours of, you shouldnt be reviewing it at all. maybe it can be part of a smaller segment where you give your two cents, but a full review? I dont know if thats fair. 

but I do think there there are exceptions. for example girlfriend reviews recently did a video on persona 5. that game can run any where from 60 to 200 hours of game play depending on how much you try to do. Persona 5 is, I think for day one reviewers anyway, a hard game to review for because its so damn long. That said, they did mention that they were going to finish the game and if I recall correctly provide a follow up. But they did get a good way through it, I even saw them playing on twitch at a part of the game that takes like any where from 20 to 60 hours to get to so they definitely saw more than the first 5% of the game.   


I just think for a FULL proper review of any given game, you gotta see the story out to the end at least.
    If a game isnt fun in the first 5 hours it's a bad game, sorry.  Why would I want to slog through 5 or 10 hours of boredom for it to maybe get good when there are fun games I can play instead?

Reviewers should finish games but for the opposite reason, to identify if games just use cheap tricks to make you think its good in the demo but with no satisfying story or endgame
I don't really think that's a viable rule to follow for most RPGs tbh
    I think it matters for any game. It's not about everything being great but if there's nothing that hooks you in the first 30-60 minutes why keep wasting your time?

It can be anything, graphics, combat, dialogues, voice acting, anything really but there has to be something compelling and this will be different for each person and each game.
    Most games rely on a loop of actions. If I'm not enjoying the loop then it's probably just not for me.
Honestly, Saying the frame rate was trash was being generous

And this is coming from someone who lord the game and the franchise.
Complaints come from PC gamers, which have been already been burned by Automata's horrible PC port.
Hell, I highly doubt the original was playing at 60fps to begin with. So, it's definitely not a good reason to pan this game.
    You're right. Gestalt was 30 FPS max (besides emulation hacks), and it sometimes went into the teens: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmYONPPAag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmYONPPAag)
    The original was not a PC game, came out during the 360/PS3 era where games had awful sub 30fps framerate and was a low budget title made by a subpar dev team(ignoring Taro's talent).

This is a PC game following up an incredibly successful game that sold 5.5million units being released in the year of flying cars: 2021. Not at all comparable.
A game locked at 30fps might give me pause, but anything over 60fps is more of a luxury for most games. Over 120hz I genuinely can't tell the difference most of the time.
    It might be a case of getting used to something, I have been playing pc games on 4K for the past 2 years, and playing a game at 1080p feels like I'm playing on 144p. I never played on 144hz but from what I hear it's hard to go back. (Not that I think its a reason to ignore a classic game like this, hell, bloodborne is locked to 30 and I will forever recommend it)
        I agree, but I think there's probably a point with framerate where you hit diminishing returns. Like, from 30-60 is a world of difference, but 60-144 is felt less in games with without twitchy camera movements, and 144-240hz even less so. For me, I don't see any difference over 144hz even in shooters.
            The difference between 60 to 144 is like 38fps vs 60fps (frame time wise); still a very noticeable difference and hard to go back to. Not sure about 240hz+ though
        I guess it depends on the person, but I have no problem playing games even at 30 fps after experiencing 144 Hz. Over time I realized that cosistent frame times are far more important to me than frame rate (ideally I'd want both of course). Also, VRR is a godsend, especially on displays over 60 Hz.
        I think the 144hz argument is only true for some game types. Yeah playing something that requires fast reaction times like a FPS will definitely feel worse if you're under 144FPS. But I can can go back to skyrim and not really feel any worse with its locked framerate.
Right? Who are these people?
    PC gamers.
    I see melodramatic comments like that on here all the time that get pretty good reception. I just chalk it up to the extremists of an already fringe community. Most normal people really don't give a shit.
Tying gameplay to framerate is dubious programming but not unheard of.  But tying gameplay to framerate without limiting the framerate is just trolling.
Breath of the wild did it
I could not give less of a shit about a framerate so long as it runs at 60fps, but the point I'm making is if it's locked to 60 then you can't exactly complain that it functions incorrectly above 60. That's the same criticism twice.
Dude it runs at 60 fps. I have everything I would need to run it at 144hz 1440p but I don't care.

These are technical hurdled imposed by time, you gotta know when things are big enough to justify the work to rework the engine and events
    Agreed. It's wild to think that many games were stuck at 30fps on the generation of consoles that *just* ended, and people are already treating 120fps as mandatory instead of a luxury.
        no better way to get developers to raise their standards of output quickly, though.
[deleted]
    Yeah really. If I can go up over 60 that's awesome I love extra high fps, but 60 solid is the goal and 144 is brownie points.

        [deleted]
Imagine skipping a masterpiece because 60fps isn't enough. Lmfao
When I saw that Platinum was attached to Automata I screamed an internal “fuck yes” because Nier already had the Yoko Taro and Okabe secret sauce. Pair that with Platinum’s flair and you get one of my favorite games ever too, in nearly every aspect.
    Did you guys like the combat in Automata? I was really excited about Platinum being involved and I loved the game overall, but I found the combat sub par. I hate how the optimal way to play is to hold in the shoot button at all times.
        Again, I think it's serviceable. I think it's better than the original Nier's combat, but it's nothing all that special. I appreciate that it's non-intrusive. I know platinum excels at intricate combat systems but I appreciate that Nier Automata isn't quite as in-depth as a Bayonetta or what have you.
        I'm not far in, but that's probably my one thing. I don't like having to hold down the trigger *forever*.
            >I'm not far in,

Get off this subreddit before you see spoilers!
                No >:D
            It gets old really fast and it's even worse on higher difficulties when you take insane dmg at close range and thus has to rely more on range attacks to kill spongey enemies. Automata is one of those games were I kind of regret not going for the easy mode.
                As someone who just finished route A on hard, I almost never had to use my ranged attack, like at all (except the ship part of course).

EDIT: Oh, I think the only time I used ranged attack is against the centipede in the castle.
                    I think they're saying the held the trigger down the entire time they were in combat while using the melee attacks. 

If I remember right, there's an option to just toggle it on and off. Either that or the attack was so weak I just didn't bother with it anyway. I know I wasn't holding the trigger down the entire time.
        It’s definitely Platinum’s weaker ones, but it’s still pretty slick, flashy and badass which I love.
        I would go so far to say the combat is substanceless. The game has great aesthetics, themes and character performances, but the one thing holding back is... its gameplay
            Definitely disagree with you there. IMO the big pitfall of automatas combat is just that it rewards certain mashable strategies, but if you really learn the intricacies of the combat it’s absolutely not completely lacking of substance. You can be pretty creative when you know what to do, [like this guy does.](https://youtu.be/d3Eh0jbddmk)

I understand your point of view though because instead of all that flashy stuff you *could* just spam evade and sprinting heavy attack. But i believe they just wanted to make the game very easily accessible. If you want to take the combat to the next level, you can.
        I started enjoying it quite a bit after replaying the game on Very Hard. Learning how to control groups and isolate enemies with extended juggles by using animation cancels made the experience much more satisfying, as did actually learning boss attack patterns. It's not the best combat system out there, but it's more than just serviceable in my opinion. 

Although, the game certainly is at fault if dying in one hit is the only way it can make me learn attack patterns. Healing is way too forgiving and powerful enemies should have some level scaling.
        it had good animation and sound design (putting it above most other action RPGs) but you could basically mash your way through everything and dodging was easy. It was also really easy to break the RPG side to trivialize things further. It's no DMC or Bayonetta but still fun.
        Automata's combat was pretty shallow especially for Platinum but I didn't really tire of it until a couple of playthroughs in. I honestly can't remember if I played it on hard or very hard but a lot of things (especially in the early game) practically one-shot me so combat became a kind of hokey cokey dance of dipping in and out, spinning around (i.e. spamming dodge). Once I got a feel for it I actually really enjoyed it, had its own rhythm and its beautifully animated. I liked it enough to go out of my way to make it look as flashy as possible (sliding about on sand was a particular favourite of mine), which helped make up for the lack of depth to a point.
        The level scaling and instant healing are both busted as well. The former makes it a complete slog to kill anything significantly higher level than you, while the latter makes anything that isn't a one hit kill almost meaningless.

Combat looks cool and the characters are fun to control, but the actual combat design is awful.
Debatable. 

Automata had better VA performances, and emotions.

But to a character like Kainé, 9S/2B/A2 don't hold a candle.

Overall, Automata is superior though.
    > 
> Automata had better VA performances, and emotions.

VA performance don't really impact on whether a character is better or not though, that's just production stuff. And Kaine VA > all of Automata.

>Overall, Automata is superior though.

It was the more well rounded game. It had better pacing and combat, while still having a solid story. But Gestalt will always be way more of a memorable game for me, in big part because Automata's android characters just didn't hit the same way as emil/kaine/weiss
Yeah, Papa NieR only exists because Yoko Taro was trying to appeal to the west. Fat lot of good that did. If we're being honest though, the main "problem" with NieR was that it was a Japanese game that didn't fit in into the traditional mold.
    And video game reviewers are on average kind of shit at reviewing narratives.
    I still prefer Papa Nier compared to Brother Nier just on the basis that I like the narrative of a father saving their child more than a sibling saving them ... Both are still great however
I don’t think you can blame the Ending C and D grind since most reviewers probably didn’t even get there.
I'm watching and longplay and what the fuck and why on earth.

It does look like mediocre gameplay with an interesting plot but it's just so weird.
    Its a really bizarre game that the secret ending leads into Nier. Its set up like a Dynasty Warriors game but the entire game, the music, the graphics, the gameplay, the story are all designed to make you paranoid and agitated.
        I can see that regarding eveyrthing but the gameplay. It just looks mindless as hell, like a Dynasty Warriors game without the spectacular. Kinda like the first Onechambara.

Then it all goes to what in the fuck land in the final third. I'm kinda glad for these games longplays are a thing. Due to a lack of hardware I can't really play these games right now (man I'd love if Sony gave a shit about BC for these kind of games. Also Valkyrie Profile), but at least I can see and somehow know what are they about.

Seriously that ending with the **Spoiler:** >!flying demonic babies!<. I saw that years ago somehow and thought it was a nightmare I had, and even when I started looking into Taro's games I had an idea this was it and could not figure out how it ended up like that.
            "It just looks mindless as hell" - yeah that sounds pretty unnerving and agitating since you dont need to think and all you hear is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NocSlsBJHxY&ab_channel=Durandana

That I think it’s just okay? Should I have thought it was better? Because I have my OG copy of the game and the voice acting was just alright. Not bad by any means, but wasn’t exactly top tier by any means either.  
  
At the time, it was just standard anime voice actors. If that floats your boat, that’s totally cool. But it wasn’t top tier
    Nah the voice acting is some of the best of the time.
        Considering all the other games of 2010, I think that’s definitely up for debate and likely in regards to whether you prefer dub anime voice actors or not, but I am by no means crazy for finding the voice acting to just be okay. “Okay” isn’t bad.
    You're fine to have your opinions. But by and large the voice acting in OG Nier is considered to be phenomenal and its voice cast is stacked as fuck by today's standards. Like you really gonna say a game with Jameson Price and Laura Bailey as the main cast has bad voice acting?

Again you're welcome to have your opinion, but recognize that a majority of people disagree with your opinion and future success of the voice actors points to them being talented. Not saying you're wrong, just saying most people would think you're wrong.
        Considering how poorly the first game sold and reviewed, I don’t think it’s crazy find the voice acting as just okay. Again, I never said it was bad. Not once. “Okay” does not equal “Bad”. It just means “Okay”. Those two people don’t suddenly make the voice acting anymore fantastic. Again, they’re just anime voice actors and they aren’t bad by any means, but aren’t exactly setting the world on fire with their performances in OG Nier either. Never said they weren’t talented. Never said they were bad. Just that the overall voice acting of the game is just okay and somewhat par the course for a lot of JRPGs of the time.  
  
Please, understand that I’m not saying the voice acting is bad by any means. I’m just saying it wasn’t top tier either and I think that is a completely fair assessment given the overall quality of the game.  
  
There is such an odd defensiveness of OG Nier as if it can’t be stated that the game has flaws. I love OG Nier. I personally find it fantastic, but there is a very clear reason why it wasn’t widely viewed as a big deal at launch. And that’s okay
            Out of interest, what games would you consider to have top-tier voice acting, particularly from the same period? I thought Nier's was pretty great (Kaine and Weiss at least), but I haven't played a ton of games.
            No. Didn't you hear them? You need to have their opinion because it's a popular one!!! Everyone would disagree! etc
            > Again, they’re just anime voice actors

Anime voice actors is just a weird term to use, because tons of voice actors do tons of things. You're differentiating anime voice actors from...what? Voice actors who only do animated shows and movies? If you look at most big name voice actors in games, they probably have some anime on their backlog. In fact, a ton probably do. 

Take The Last of Us, which is probably the furthest you could get from anime, plenty of the main voice actors there have done plenty of anime. Troy Baker voices Joel but did anime for like 10 years before he even got the part. Laura Bailey voices Abby in TLoU2 and has also done a ton of anime, in addition to being Kaine. But they didn't just do anime, they were doing a wide variety of other video games too: western games and Japanese games both. 

That's not to say you can't have your opinion or that it's invalid, I just don't think "anime voice actors" is even really all that useful a distinction. Almost all working video game VAs, including the ones in Nier, do a mix of anime, American cartoons, Western video games, and Japanese video games.
If you state you didn't finish the game and exactly why I think a review is totally fine. You might miss out on part of what makes a game something special but then the reader and either write it off altogether or seek out another review to decide if it's worth it. 

Especially with a game like Nier - it finishes stronger than it starts narratively but vastly worse gameplay-wise, and if nothing up front in the first ten or so hours catches someone's interest enough to put up with its worse aspects, it's unlikely anything in the last ten hours will make up for that.
    > If you state you didn't finish the game and exactly why

Isn't Nier the game where the [reviewer gave up after the game told him to catch a fish and didn't explain that no, you needed the fish from over THERE](https://www.engadget.com/2010-05-03-nier-review-fail.html).
        yup yup. the part my guy Juice there leaves out is that the instructions for how to fish in the game are also incorrect, so a reviewer would just have to fuck around until it worked before they even get around to figuring out there's somewhere else to fish.
    And it's not like a game can't do it better while delivering the same themes. Nier Automata proves that decisively. Enjoyable gaming experience right from the get-go, and narratively engaging at the start. Of course, it's really in ending C-E where it reaches its amazing apex, but even without those endings, it would still be a quality experience.
Even if you finish the whole game, it's valid to critique how long the game takes to get good. Most people aren't going to go through hours of mediocre gameplay and basic story just to get to the good part.
I disagree. Not wanting to completely finish a game is a valid reaction, after all.

Let's take it to the logical extreme: imagine how warped the reviews would be if BotW only got reviewed by people who gathered all 900 Korok seeds. It would basically filter out everyone except the most hardcore players who just so happened to be most compatible with that particular game!

Games *can* be experienced without achieving some arbitrary measure of completeness. Reviews should reflect that basic truth. If a reviewer couldn't stomach finishing a game, *you bet* that I would want to know that. I want a review that actually represents the reviewer's individual experience with the game, not a fruitless attempt at assigning something as nebulous as artistic value or intrinsic worth.
I don't think it applies with this game.

I love NieR:A. One of my favorite games of all time.

That said. I wouldn't recommend it to most people. The beginning of the game drags way too long and is the worst aspect of the game IMO.

The game doesn't really pick up story-wise till after you 'beat the game' once.

I dropped the game once before getting to the parts I really liked.

Guess my point is I think its totally valid for someone to burn out on one of these games before completing it especially because they quite literally demand you to replay the game over again before really seeing significant progress in the story.
Right, but the game doesn’t start to truly standout until it’s latter half. Even for as good as the endings and really last half of the story is, the intro is still pretty standard and wasn’t exactly enticing a wide range of people at the time. You have to play the first half to get to the fantastic last half story, but if it’s a bit of a slog to get there, that’s going to affect the overall opinion of the game. The endings of the game, for as great as they are, didn’t make up for the rest of the game that was already rather lackluster for its time.  
  
And I say this as someone who loves original Nier
Why? I don't have to finish a bad meal to know I'm not going to enjoy it. If a movie isn't grabbing me an hour in I'm not gonna lose sleep over giving it 1 star on Letterboxd. Why should I have to play every single minute of a video game before being able to leave a review?
    You shouldn't ever have to play through the entire game for a review, just as long as you let the reader know you didn't finish it in the article. That way, they can make an informed decision about whether the review is useful or not.
I wonder how many reviewers even knew how to get the true ending. All weapons is somewhat of a chore, even if NG+ runs are quick.
    Getting all the weapons isnt too bad and it isnt like Drakengard where you have to max them all out
        >Getting all the weapons isnt too bad 

That's quite a understatement, heh. You could miss out on some of them in first half of game without a guide and after halfway point, you were pretty much softlocked unless you chose to restart over all way from the beginning.
            There are no missable weapons in Nier. You can get every single weapon at the very end of the game.
                Weird, I recalled just giving up after reading some guide mentioning I missed some quests with weapon rewards.
                    Nope, there is only 1 weapon that you can "miss" by not doing a sidequest and that weapon can be bought at a shop for a period of time after the "timeskip". So if you miss it on your first playthrough, when you start at the midway point during your second you can go buy it.
The more accurate/complicated answer is that there were two versions of OG NieR in Japan - NieR Replicant (PS3) and NieR Gestalt (Xbox 360).

NieR Replicant had a young protagonist (brother trying to save his sister); NieR Gestalt had an older protagonist (father trying to save his daughter). Other than that, they're the same game.

But Replicant didn't get localized in the West, only Gestalt did, and they dropped the subtitle since there was only one version - so the North American game "NieR" is NieR Gestalt, with the "father" protagonist (and it got released on PS3 as well in the West, unlike in Japan).

This game is an updated remaster of NieR Replicant, the version with the "brother" protagonist that we never got in the West.
I was on PS4 and I had loads of little bugs here and there, the Kind that makes you laugh rather than impacting it badly though. My personal favourite was my weapon getting stuck spinning around all over the place like Joel is a magician.
    Sorry but I don’t think this is common
They're working on a patch for Automata right now. Unless you're aware of that and implying it'll never come out.
    Wow already? That was fast. Can't believe it only took them 4 years.
    Took them 4 years, you wanna wait 4 years for all their PC ports to potentially get fixed? 

While they're at it, maybe they should upgrade from ps2/3 era graphics fidelity.
        You realize this is a remaster of a ps3 game from 2010 right? Maybe you should look up a graphics comparison video if you think it’s ps3 era.
>cum

Zero will violate you, both from and back, all in 60 FPS.
    I want to find that interview where Taro jokingly mentions the difficult frame was to make you feel bad about what was happening because how awful your character was. How hype is the idea that the game itself doesn’t want you to commit game crimes so it’s actively trying to prevent you from going forward. It’s a joke and not reality, but such a funny idea. My favorite are games that when making a choice ask you if you are sure, but then a second window appears right after to go “but, are you really sure?”.
Yep, Automata is one of my fav games (played on release on PS4) but playing it recently on steam it was a buggy mess, just refunded before the two hours, the game pass version is okay but I still had a crash and some drops below 60 unfortunately
Automata was unplayable to me until I installed FAR.  FAR fixed everything but a really minor frame pacing issue in the open game world.  Played perfect in the actual "zones" though.
This, and any fix will break the current FAR mod which will require a mod update.
Two different dev teams.   Maybe Square will let them patch Replicant where they wouldn't let Platinum, since Plat announced they were working on patches before their involvement ended.
Precisely because it is so variable. Removing the need to account for framerate differences removes a lot of variance you would need to account for. Especially when you design a game primarily for consoles, when porting to PC it simplifies a lot to just force the PC to act like a console.
Any plans on patching this game for them? :D
You're absolutely right. Decided to put the console to use though, feel like I'll enjoy the game more on the couch and take my time with it. Can't wait.
You the man dog. Just made my night look a lot better.
Ghost Trick is also available on iOS if I remember correctly. I think that might be how I played it actually... wild, awesome story.
Great news! I love collecting physical games and WalMart usually has games for about $10 cheaper + compatible with PS5. Win-win-win
Oh hell yea, that's great to hear. >!Tbf I wouldn't mind even if it was just an adaptation of the one from the novels. I don't really know the nitty gritty of it besides a TL;DR, and it's been like 4 years since I even read *that*.!<
Damn, Poland is still $60 on Steam so I've decided to wait for a sale :/
ffx fans !
    FFX is also one of my two favorite games of all time. Love that game.
> I have now just started a replay of Auto from the start though and seeing Emil and certain details like the dessert robotsmasks that I had forgot about are awesome. So some genuine joy came out of it.

Glad it retroactively worked out for you in that sense in enhanced your Nier: A experience. You may appreciate this trove of information at this stage: >![The Ark](https://theark.wiki/w/Welcome).!<
  
 
> and considering I didn't do all the side quests in the first half I also knew I wouldn't be able to get all the endings. 

Just a heads up in case you come back one day you don't need to do all the side quests, just collect all the weapons (though some Part 2 SQs do give weapons). Any weapons missed in Part 1 can be bought in Part 2 from the shops, so you also don't need to sweat that aspect of it.
pretty sure Yoko Taro did that on purpose. he's an edgy guy and it's funny. most people will call it the Nier Replicant remake/remaster and it won't be confusing
    Nier Replicant alone sorta works too since the old one is called Gestalt, and to casual fans this is just a brand new prequel anyway.
[deleted]
    We're talking about game titles here, not the story
Look I'll be the first to defend the plot of KH as not being all that complicated, but names like " Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover", "Kingdom Hearts 0.2: Birth by Sleep – A Fragmentary Passage", and "Kingdom Hearts Unchained χ/Kingdom Hearts Union χ[Cross]/Kingdom Hearts Union χ Dark Road" are just nonsense.
I'm not saying he's lying. I'm saying his perceptions of his own work can be skewed, and that can affect the way he assesses them. In particular, I've picked up on some higher levels of humility and self-doubt when he discusses his work, which could absolutely affect this exact scenario.
    I get what you are trying to say. Taro loves self depreciating. But the "this is not a full remake" is not one of those. It's not just Taro the entire team stated that as a very matter of fact thing. 

As someone who 100% OG NieR, I can tell you this is the same game. They have very clearly shown the part they remade like the core combat and what parts they left exactly the same. Like the environments and stuff. Most of the environment assets arent even remade just upscaled and further polished and the team confirmed that. If people are going in expecting a brand new experience, this is not it. It's gonna feel slightly dated because at its core it is still a low budget ps3 jrpg.
> It wasn't a good port but it worked

For some people.  I bought it on release and never got it working properly on my 770 even with the FAR mod, and I heard similar stories for other people with 700 series cards.  Reinstalled it later when I got a 1080 and it ran fine.
    Yeah it specifically hated the architecture that the 700 and 960 and below ran on.
I would call crashing every 30 min is broken.
[deleted]
    These issues only popped up for some people, through multiple systems I've had zero issues other than the framerate which isn't something I completely care about.  
Game never crashed, never had any issue with resolution, had online on for the entire game and multiple playthroughs without issue and this was all at launch with a pc that was pretty standard at the time (i5 4690k, 290x, 16GB DDR3) and still now with a much beefier pc I've had zero issues with the PC version (i9 9900k, 64GB DDR4, RTX 3090)
    Can't say I noticed or experienced all of those. Framerate issues yes. I don't really have a good eye for resolution so if it was the case it didn't bother me. Don't recall getting a CTD but I might be misremembering. Also my rig would have been pretty beefy at the time so might have factored in.

I would never consider watching someone else play a game as a replacement for me playing it. Different strokes, I guess.
        That's all fine, but yeah, Automata was *rough* on release.

I personally dealt with the Resolution issues, Lighting Issues/Artifacts, CTD's, and other things.  Still, I loved the game.
That's what I've heard but I was too burned out to push through. I'm glad so many people love it but it just isn't my type of game.
> It's really frustrating, but it's a game for people who really want to experience things that are not in any other games.
>
> is its experimental nature, and games like these are few and far between, hence why fans hold these in high praises.

I could kinda see a glimmer of that in the game. For example, I accidentally triggered Ending 'K' by eating the fish in the desert, and that was odd but funny, and I liked that. So I know what you mean, and I appreciate things like that too. I'm not adverse to experimental games myself, I freaking love Death Stranding for example and it seemed like a lot of gamers didn't care for that one. I like trying new things, but Automata just didn't click for me personally. Like you said, it's a long setup to wait for the good stuff, and while I am a patient person I simply have less interest in it after slogging through the first playthrough.

> FF7R was not my thing. Dark Souls is not my thing. Persona 5 just isn't my thing.

I am currently playing the original FF7 before I try the remake, but I liked the demo. I have not played any of the Persona games, but they have piqued my interest. Dark Souls however I am a *huge* fan of, so maybe that says something about me as a gamer.
It's literally for no reason except for having the character be sexually appealing, as per Yoko Taro interviews though lmao.  This is on par with excusing Quiet's character design because "She breathes through her skin!!!"
it feels much better. magic and melee is woven together way more smoothly, and although the combos don't have anything on automata ( makes sense. these aren't combat androids ) it's definitely an enjoyable experience this time.
If a game isnt fun in the first 5 hours it's a bad game, sorry.  Why would I want to slog through 5 or 10 hours of boredom for it to maybe get good when there are fun games I can play instead?

Reviewers should finish games but for the opposite reason, to identify if games just use cheap tricks to make you think its good in the demo but with no satisfying story or endgame
I think it matters for any game. It's not about everything being great but if there's nothing that hooks you in the first 30-60 minutes why keep wasting your time?

It can be anything, graphics, combat, dialogues, voice acting, anything really but there has to be something compelling and this will be different for each person and each game.
Most games rely on a loop of actions. If I'm not enjoying the loop then it's probably just not for me.
You're right. Gestalt was 30 FPS max (besides emulation hacks), and it sometimes went into the teens: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmYONPPAag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmYONPPAag)
The original was not a PC game, came out during the 360/PS3 era where games had awful sub 30fps framerate and was a low budget title made by a subpar dev team(ignoring Taro's talent).

This is a PC game following up an incredibly successful game that sold 5.5million units being released in the year of flying cars: 2021. Not at all comparable.
It might be a case of getting used to something, I have been playing pc games on 4K for the past 2 years, and playing a game at 1080p feels like I'm playing on 144p. I never played on 144hz but from what I hear it's hard to go back. (Not that I think its a reason to ignore a classic game like this, hell, bloodborne is locked to 30 and I will forever recommend it)
    I agree, but I think there's probably a point with framerate where you hit diminishing returns. Like, from 30-60 is a world of difference, but 60-144 is felt less in games with without twitchy camera movements, and 144-240hz even less so. For me, I don't see any difference over 144hz even in shooters.
        The difference between 60 to 144 is like 38fps vs 60fps (frame time wise); still a very noticeable difference and hard to go back to. Not sure about 240hz+ though
    I guess it depends on the person, but I have no problem playing games even at 30 fps after experiencing 144 Hz. Over time I realized that cosistent frame times are far more important to me than frame rate (ideally I'd want both of course). Also, VRR is a godsend, especially on displays over 60 Hz.
    I think the 144hz argument is only true for some game types. Yeah playing something that requires fast reaction times like a FPS will definitely feel worse if you're under 144FPS. But I can can go back to skyrim and not really feel any worse with its locked framerate.
PC gamers.
I see melodramatic comments like that on here all the time that get pretty good reception. I just chalk it up to the extremists of an already fringe community. Most normal people really don't give a shit.
Agreed. It's wild to think that many games were stuck at 30fps on the generation of consoles that *just* ended, and people are already treating 120fps as mandatory instead of a luxury.
    no better way to get developers to raise their standards of output quickly, though.
Yeah really. If I can go up over 60 that's awesome I love extra high fps, but 60 solid is the goal and 144 is brownie points.

Did you guys like the combat in Automata? I was really excited about Platinum being involved and I loved the game overall, but I found the combat sub par. I hate how the optimal way to play is to hold in the shoot button at all times.
    Again, I think it's serviceable. I think it's better than the original Nier's combat, but it's nothing all that special. I appreciate that it's non-intrusive. I know platinum excels at intricate combat systems but I appreciate that Nier Automata isn't quite as in-depth as a Bayonetta or what have you.
    I'm not far in, but that's probably my one thing. I don't like having to hold down the trigger *forever*.
        >I'm not far in,

Get off this subreddit before you see spoilers!
            No >:D
        It gets old really fast and it's even worse on higher difficulties when you take insane dmg at close range and thus has to rely more on range attacks to kill spongey enemies. Automata is one of those games were I kind of regret not going for the easy mode.
            As someone who just finished route A on hard, I almost never had to use my ranged attack, like at all (except the ship part of course).

EDIT: Oh, I think the only time I used ranged attack is against the centipede in the castle.
                I think they're saying the held the trigger down the entire time they were in combat while using the melee attacks. 

If I remember right, there's an option to just toggle it on and off. Either that or the attack was so weak I just didn't bother with it anyway. I know I wasn't holding the trigger down the entire time.
    It’s definitely Platinum’s weaker ones, but it’s still pretty slick, flashy and badass which I love.
    I would go so far to say the combat is substanceless. The game has great aesthetics, themes and character performances, but the one thing holding back is... its gameplay
        Definitely disagree with you there. IMO the big pitfall of automatas combat is just that it rewards certain mashable strategies, but if you really learn the intricacies of the combat it’s absolutely not completely lacking of substance. You can be pretty creative when you know what to do, [like this guy does.](https://youtu.be/d3Eh0jbddmk)

I understand your point of view though because instead of all that flashy stuff you *could* just spam evade and sprinting heavy attack. But i believe they just wanted to make the game very easily accessible. If you want to take the combat to the next level, you can.
    I started enjoying it quite a bit after replaying the game on Very Hard. Learning how to control groups and isolate enemies with extended juggles by using animation cancels made the experience much more satisfying, as did actually learning boss attack patterns. It's not the best combat system out there, but it's more than just serviceable in my opinion. 

Although, the game certainly is at fault if dying in one hit is the only way it can make me learn attack patterns. Healing is way too forgiving and powerful enemies should have some level scaling.
    it had good animation and sound design (putting it above most other action RPGs) but you could basically mash your way through everything and dodging was easy. It was also really easy to break the RPG side to trivialize things further. It's no DMC or Bayonetta but still fun.
    Automata's combat was pretty shallow especially for Platinum but I didn't really tire of it until a couple of playthroughs in. I honestly can't remember if I played it on hard or very hard but a lot of things (especially in the early game) practically one-shot me so combat became a kind of hokey cokey dance of dipping in and out, spinning around (i.e. spamming dodge). Once I got a feel for it I actually really enjoyed it, had its own rhythm and its beautifully animated. I liked it enough to go out of my way to make it look as flashy as possible (sliding about on sand was a particular favourite of mine), which helped make up for the lack of depth to a point.
    The level scaling and instant healing are both busted as well. The former makes it a complete slog to kill anything significantly higher level than you, while the latter makes anything that isn't a one hit kill almost meaningless.

Combat looks cool and the characters are fun to control, but the actual combat design is awful.
> 
> Automata had better VA performances, and emotions.

VA performance don't really impact on whether a character is better or not though, that's just production stuff. And Kaine VA > all of Automata.

>Overall, Automata is superior though.

It was the more well rounded game. It had better pacing and combat, while still having a solid story. But Gestalt will always be way more of a memorable game for me, in big part because Automata's android characters just didn't hit the same way as emil/kaine/weiss
And video game reviewers are on average kind of shit at reviewing narratives.
I still prefer Papa Nier compared to Brother Nier just on the basis that I like the narrative of a father saving their child more than a sibling saving them ... Both are still great however
Its a really bizarre game that the secret ending leads into Nier. Its set up like a Dynasty Warriors game but the entire game, the music, the graphics, the gameplay, the story are all designed to make you paranoid and agitated.
    I can see that regarding eveyrthing but the gameplay. It just looks mindless as hell, like a Dynasty Warriors game without the spectacular. Kinda like the first Onechambara.

Then it all goes to what in the fuck land in the final third. I'm kinda glad for these games longplays are a thing. Due to a lack of hardware I can't really play these games right now (man I'd love if Sony gave a shit about BC for these kind of games. Also Valkyrie Profile), but at least I can see and somehow know what are they about.

Seriously that ending with the **Spoiler:** >!flying demonic babies!<. I saw that years ago somehow and thought it was a nightmare I had, and even when I started looking into Taro's games I had an idea this was it and could not figure out how it ended up like that.
        "It just looks mindless as hell" - yeah that sounds pretty unnerving and agitating since you dont need to think and all you hear is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NocSlsBJHxY&ab_channel=Durandana

Nah the voice acting is some of the best of the time.
    Considering all the other games of 2010, I think that’s definitely up for debate and likely in regards to whether you prefer dub anime voice actors or not, but I am by no means crazy for finding the voice acting to just be okay. “Okay” isn’t bad.
You're fine to have your opinions. But by and large the voice acting in OG Nier is considered to be phenomenal and its voice cast is stacked as fuck by today's standards. Like you really gonna say a game with Jameson Price and Laura Bailey as the main cast has bad voice acting?

Again you're welcome to have your opinion, but recognize that a majority of people disagree with your opinion and future success of the voice actors points to them being talented. Not saying you're wrong, just saying most people would think you're wrong.
    Considering how poorly the first game sold and reviewed, I don’t think it’s crazy find the voice acting as just okay. Again, I never said it was bad. Not once. “Okay” does not equal “Bad”. It just means “Okay”. Those two people don’t suddenly make the voice acting anymore fantastic. Again, they’re just anime voice actors and they aren’t bad by any means, but aren’t exactly setting the world on fire with their performances in OG Nier either. Never said they weren’t talented. Never said they were bad. Just that the overall voice acting of the game is just okay and somewhat par the course for a lot of JRPGs of the time.  
  
Please, understand that I’m not saying the voice acting is bad by any means. I’m just saying it wasn’t top tier either and I think that is a completely fair assessment given the overall quality of the game.  
  
There is such an odd defensiveness of OG Nier as if it can’t be stated that the game has flaws. I love OG Nier. I personally find it fantastic, but there is a very clear reason why it wasn’t widely viewed as a big deal at launch. And that’s okay
        Out of interest, what games would you consider to have top-tier voice acting, particularly from the same period? I thought Nier's was pretty great (Kaine and Weiss at least), but I haven't played a ton of games.
        No. Didn't you hear them? You need to have their opinion because it's a popular one!!! Everyone would disagree! etc
        > Again, they’re just anime voice actors

Anime voice actors is just a weird term to use, because tons of voice actors do tons of things. You're differentiating anime voice actors from...what? Voice actors who only do animated shows and movies? If you look at most big name voice actors in games, they probably have some anime on their backlog. In fact, a ton probably do. 

Take The Last of Us, which is probably the furthest you could get from anime, plenty of the main voice actors there have done plenty of anime. Troy Baker voices Joel but did anime for like 10 years before he even got the part. Laura Bailey voices Abby in TLoU2 and has also done a ton of anime, in addition to being Kaine. But they didn't just do anime, they were doing a wide variety of other video games too: western games and Japanese games both. 

That's not to say you can't have your opinion or that it's invalid, I just don't think "anime voice actors" is even really all that useful a distinction. Almost all working video game VAs, including the ones in Nier, do a mix of anime, American cartoons, Western video games, and Japanese video games.
> If you state you didn't finish the game and exactly why

Isn't Nier the game where the [reviewer gave up after the game told him to catch a fish and didn't explain that no, you needed the fish from over THERE](https://www.engadget.com/2010-05-03-nier-review-fail.html).
    yup yup. the part my guy Juice there leaves out is that the instructions for how to fish in the game are also incorrect, so a reviewer would just have to fuck around until it worked before they even get around to figuring out there's somewhere else to fish.
And it's not like a game can't do it better while delivering the same themes. Nier Automata proves that decisively. Enjoyable gaming experience right from the get-go, and narratively engaging at the start. Of course, it's really in ending C-E where it reaches its amazing apex, but even without those endings, it would still be a quality experience.
You shouldn't ever have to play through the entire game for a review, just as long as you let the reader know you didn't finish it in the article. That way, they can make an informed decision about whether the review is useful or not.
Getting all the weapons isnt too bad and it isnt like Drakengard where you have to max them all out
    >Getting all the weapons isnt too bad 

That's quite a understatement, heh. You could miss out on some of them in first half of game without a guide and after halfway point, you were pretty much softlocked unless you chose to restart over all way from the beginning.

Sorry but I don’t think this is common
Wow already? That was fast. Can't believe it only took them 4 years.
Took them 4 years, you wanna wait 4 years for all their PC ports to potentially get fixed? 

While they're at it, maybe they should upgrade from ps2/3 era graphics fidelity.
    You realize this is a remaster of a ps3 game from 2010 right? Maybe you should look up a graphics comparison video if you think it’s ps3 era.
I want to find that interview where Taro jokingly mentions the difficult frame was to make you feel bad about what was happening because how awful your character was. How hype is the idea that the game itself doesn’t want you to commit game crimes so it’s actively trying to prevent you from going forward. It’s a joke and not reality, but such a funny idea. My favorite are games that when making a choice ask you if you are sure, but then a second window appears right after to go “but, are you really sure?”.
FFX is also one of my two favorite games of all time. Love that game.
Nier Replicant alone sorta works too since the old one is called Gestalt, and to casual fans this is just a brand new prequel anyway.
We're talking about game titles here, not the story
I get what you are trying to say. Taro loves self depreciating. But the "this is not a full remake" is not one of those. It's not just Taro the entire team stated that as a very matter of fact thing. 

As someone who 100% OG NieR, I can tell you this is the same game. They have very clearly shown the part they remade like the core combat and what parts they left exactly the same. Like the environments and stuff. Most of the environment assets arent even remade just upscaled and further polished and the team confirmed that. If people are going in expecting a brand new experience, this is not it. It's gonna feel slightly dated because at its core it is still a low budget ps3 jrpg.
Yeah it specifically hated the architecture that the 700 and 960 and below ran on.
These issues only popped up for some people, through multiple systems I've had zero issues other than the framerate which isn't something I completely care about.  
Game never crashed, never had any issue with resolution, had online on for the entire game and multiple playthroughs without issue and this was all at launch with a pc that was pretty standard at the time (i5 4690k, 290x, 16GB DDR3) and still now with a much beefier pc I've had zero issues with the PC version (i9 9900k, 64GB DDR4, RTX 3090)
Can't say I noticed or experienced all of those. Framerate issues yes. I don't really have a good eye for resolution so if it was the case it didn't bother me. Don't recall getting a CTD but I might be misremembering. Also my rig would have been pretty beefy at the time so might have factored in.

I would never consider watching someone else play a game as a replacement for me playing it. Different strokes, I guess.
    That's all fine, but yeah, Automata was *rough* on release.

I personally dealt with the Resolution issues, Lighting Issues/Artifacts, CTD's, and other things.  Still, I loved the game.
I agree, but I think there's probably a point with framerate where you hit diminishing returns. Like, from 30-60 is a world of difference, but 60-144 is felt less in games with without twitchy camera movements, and 144-240hz even less so. For me, I don't see any difference over 144hz even in shooters.
    The difference between 60 to 144 is like 38fps vs 60fps (frame time wise); still a very noticeable difference and hard to go back to. Not sure about 240hz+ though
I guess it depends on the person, but I have no problem playing games even at 30 fps after experiencing 144 Hz. Over time I realized that cosistent frame times are far more important to me than frame rate (ideally I'd want both of course). Also, VRR is a godsend, especially on displays over 60 Hz.
I think the 144hz argument is only true for some game types. Yeah playing something that requires fast reaction times like a FPS will definitely feel worse if you're under 144FPS. But I can can go back to skyrim and not really feel any worse with its locked framerate.
no better way to get developers to raise their standards of output quickly, though.

Again, I think it's serviceable. I think it's better than the original Nier's combat, but it's nothing all that special. I appreciate that it's non-intrusive. I know platinum excels at intricate combat systems but I appreciate that Nier Automata isn't quite as in-depth as a Bayonetta or what have you.
I'm not far in, but that's probably my one thing. I don't like having to hold down the trigger *forever*.
    >I'm not far in,

Get off this subreddit before you see spoilers!
        No >:D
    It gets old really fast and it's even worse on higher difficulties when you take insane dmg at close range and thus has to rely more on range attacks to kill spongey enemies. Automata is one of those games were I kind of regret not going for the easy mode.
        As someone who just finished route A on hard, I almost never had to use my ranged attack, like at all (except the ship part of course).

EDIT: Oh, I think the only time I used ranged attack is against the centipede in the castle.
            I think they're saying the held the trigger down the entire time they were in combat while using the melee attacks. 

If I remember right, there's an option to just toggle it on and off. Either that or the attack was so weak I just didn't bother with it anyway. I know I wasn't holding the trigger down the entire time.
It’s definitely Platinum’s weaker ones, but it’s still pretty slick, flashy and badass which I love.
I would go so far to say the combat is substanceless. The game has great aesthetics, themes and character performances, but the one thing holding back is... its gameplay
    Definitely disagree with you there. IMO the big pitfall of automatas combat is just that it rewards certain mashable strategies, but if you really learn the intricacies of the combat it’s absolutely not completely lacking of substance. You can be pretty creative when you know what to do, [like this guy does.](https://youtu.be/d3Eh0jbddmk)

I understand your point of view though because instead of all that flashy stuff you *could* just spam evade and sprinting heavy attack. But i believe they just wanted to make the game very easily accessible. If you want to take the combat to the next level, you can.
I started enjoying it quite a bit after replaying the game on Very Hard. Learning how to control groups and isolate enemies with extended juggles by using animation cancels made the experience much more satisfying, as did actually learning boss attack patterns. It's not the best combat system out there, but it's more than just serviceable in my opinion. 

Although, the game certainly is at fault if dying in one hit is the only way it can make me learn attack patterns. Healing is way too forgiving and powerful enemies should have some level scaling.
it had good animation and sound design (putting it above most other action RPGs) but you could basically mash your way through everything and dodging was easy. It was also really easy to break the RPG side to trivialize things further. It's no DMC or Bayonetta but still fun.
Automata's combat was pretty shallow especially for Platinum but I didn't really tire of it until a couple of playthroughs in. I honestly can't remember if I played it on hard or very hard but a lot of things (especially in the early game) practically one-shot me so combat became a kind of hokey cokey dance of dipping in and out, spinning around (i.e. spamming dodge). Once I got a feel for it I actually really enjoyed it, had its own rhythm and its beautifully animated. I liked it enough to go out of my way to make it look as flashy as possible (sliding about on sand was a particular favourite of mine), which helped make up for the lack of depth to a point.
The level scaling and instant healing are both busted as well. The former makes it a complete slog to kill anything significantly higher level than you, while the latter makes anything that isn't a one hit kill almost meaningless.

Combat looks cool and the characters are fun to control, but the actual combat design is awful.
I can see that regarding eveyrthing but the gameplay. It just looks mindless as hell, like a Dynasty Warriors game without the spectacular. Kinda like the first Onechambara.

Then it all goes to what in the fuck land in the final third. I'm kinda glad for these games longplays are a thing. Due to a lack of hardware I can't really play these games right now (man I'd love if Sony gave a shit about BC for these kind of games. Also Valkyrie Profile), but at least I can see and somehow know what are they about.

Seriously that ending with the **Spoiler:** >!flying demonic babies!<. I saw that years ago somehow and thought it was a nightmare I had, and even when I started looking into Taro's games I had an idea this was it and could not figure out how it ended up like that.

Considering all the other games of 2010, I think that’s definitely up for debate and likely in regards to whether you prefer dub anime voice actors or not, but I am by no means crazy for finding the voice acting to just be okay. “Okay” isn’t bad.
Considering how poorly the first game sold and reviewed, I don’t think it’s crazy find the voice acting as just okay. Again, I never said it was bad. Not once. “Okay” does not equal “Bad”. It just means “Okay”. Those two people don’t suddenly make the voice acting anymore fantastic. Again, they’re just anime voice actors and they aren’t bad by any means, but aren’t exactly setting the world on fire with their performances in OG Nier either. Never said they weren’t talented. Never said they were bad. Just that the overall voice acting of the game is just okay and somewhat par the course for a lot of JRPGs of the time.  
  
Please, understand that I’m not saying the voice acting is bad by any means. I’m just saying it wasn’t top tier either and I think that is a completely fair assessment given the overall quality of the game.  
  
There is such an odd defensiveness of OG Nier as if it can’t be stated that the game has flaws. I love OG Nier. I personally find it fantastic, but there is a very clear reason why it wasn’t widely viewed as a big deal at launch. And that’s okay
    Out of interest, what games would you consider to have top-tier voice acting, particularly from the same period? I thought Nier's was pretty great (Kaine and Weiss at least), but I haven't played a ton of games.
    No. Didn't you hear them? You need to have their opinion because it's a popular one!!! Everyone would disagree! etc
    > Again, they’re just anime voice actors

Anime voice actors is just a weird term to use, because tons of voice actors do tons of things. You're differentiating anime voice actors from...what? Voice actors who only do animated shows and movies? If you look at most big name voice actors in games, they probably have some anime on their backlog. In fact, a ton probably do. 

Take The Last of Us, which is probably the furthest you could get from anime, plenty of the main voice actors there have done plenty of anime. Troy Baker voices Joel but did anime for like 10 years before he even got the part. Laura Bailey voices Abby in TLoU2 and has also done a ton of anime, in addition to being Kaine. But they didn't just do anime, they were doing a wide variety of other video games too: western games and Japanese games both. 

That's not to say you can't have your opinion or that it's invalid, I just don't think "anime voice actors" is even really all that useful a distinction. Almost all working video game VAs, including the ones in Nier, do a mix of anime, American cartoons, Western video games, and Japanese video games.
yup yup. the part my guy Juice there leaves out is that the instructions for how to fish in the game are also incorrect, so a reviewer would just have to fuck around until it worked before they even get around to figuring out there's somewhere else to fish.
>Getting all the weapons isnt too bad 

That's quite a understatement, heh. You could miss out on some of them in first half of game without a guide and after halfway point, you were pretty much softlocked unless you chose to restart over all way from the beginning.
    There are no missable weapons in Nier. You can get every single weapon at the very end of the game.
        Weird, I recalled just giving up after reading some guide mentioning I missed some quests with weapon rewards.
            Nope, there is only 1 weapon that you can "miss" by not doing a sidequest and that weapon can be bought at a shop for a period of time after the "timeskip". So if you miss it on your first playthrough, when you start at the midway point during your second you can go buy it.
