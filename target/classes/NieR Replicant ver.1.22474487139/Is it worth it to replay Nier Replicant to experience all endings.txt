[[Is it worth it to replay Nier Replicant to experience all endings]]


I didn't quite enjoy the first ending of the game, the last third was quite a slog for me. I also fail to see how this story is considered deep/good.

>!To me, it just seems like a basic zombie movie: White Chlorination disease, which came from magic experiments, turns humans into shades. People create androids/synthetics/replicants to try and put the human consciousness of the shades into these vessels. Somehow those vessels have personalities and consciousness, because why the fuck not. Emil has magic powers because why not, Shades look like animals because why the fuck not, two floating, speaking books with magic powers because why not. How do replicants reproduce, why do they grow old, what is black scrawl? The answer is always the same: don't think about it, it's fantasy magic mixed with "science" to try to make it look sophisticated when some of the characters have existential questions that are far from mind blowing/bending.!<

Does the story get any better with route B, C, D and E or would it just be a pointless endeavor for someone like me?


Maybe you can try Call of Duty: Zombies for a better zombie story.

                        Cool. Itâ€™s okay if you donâ€™t see it. You donâ€™t have to impose blindness on people who do. Itâ€™s also okay if you donâ€™t like it.

                        The burden of convincing you to like a thing is not on existing fans; nobody here gives a shit if you like the game or not. 

Also, what kind of reception did you expect when you enter the conversation with a reductive and poor attitude? 

Plenty of other games out there; go play one of them.
Maybe this is an unpopular opinion...but I feel like the actual plot line (e.g. the events that happen) is not really the important point here. I feel like people tend to focus on the "lore" and go really deep on that stuff, but I don't think that stuff really matters all that much. But I don't think you really get the main point from this game by focusing on the plot and playing ending A.

The changes in ending B at least are basically necessary to see the "point" of the game. And I think it's totally worthwhile to spend the time getting ending B even if you don't care for the plot. If that doesn't convince you there's something really interesting about this game, that's fine! I'd say based on your description, the "story" specifically doesn't really get a ton more interesting, but your role in it as the player does.

I say all of this with this game being my favorite game of all time, so my point about the plot not being that important isn't because I don't like it. I do - I just don't really feel like that's the main point of the game.
Replicant can be a bit of a slog, but Route B amd C/D do reveal more of the plot. Some of your questions are not answered until Automata, and some aren't even amswered until Reincarnation. It keeps folding back in and branching off, and I suspect that most of the fans are fans not because they even necessarily like the story all that much, but because they refuse to give up on the series until they figure out what's going on.

You know less than you think you do. That is not a moral judgment: the story is designed to make you feel this way.

>To me, it just seems like a basic zombie movie: White Chlorination disease, which came from magic experiments, turns humans into shades. 

You're actually pretty close here, but not all the way. >!White Chlorination Syndrome is indeed a basic zombie disease, but Shades aren't the zombies. What WCS creates are called Legion, and they are finally eradicated not long before Replicant even begins So yeah, that's like *several* games' worth of backstory, and we haven't even started the first game yet. Because this series is weird.!<

>People create androids/synthetics/replicants to try and put the human consciousness of the shades into these vessels. Somehow those vessels have personalities and consciousness, because why the fuck not.

Again, close. >!The zombie disease works by interacting with a cosmic-horror god from another world. Humans found a way to prevent people from getting the disease, but it required separating their souls from their bodies: this prevents the virus from using the soul to contact the god, and prevents the god from reaching back through the soul to corrupt the body. Gestalts are the souls that have been separated this way. I'll talk about Shades later.!<

>!Replicants are cloned bodies of the people who are preserved this way. They aren't supposed to have souls, because when it's safe the Gestalt is supposed to inhabit the Replicant again. But Replicants have recently started developing their own souls anyway, because why the fuck not.!<

>Emil has magic powers because why not

>!He was part of another project to fight the Legion. His sister was actually the one chosen to be the superweapon, but he was used as a failsafe in case she went rogue.!<

>Shades look like animals because why the fuck not

OK, yeah, you've got me here.

>two floating, speaking books with magic powers because why not.

>!They were created as part of the process to separate souls from bodies, and to rejoin them. There were 11 other books (you actually fight one of them in the game), but their functions are unknown.!<

>How do replicants reproduce, why do they grow old,

Replicants don't reproduce. When a new one is needed, the androids clone one and send it to an enclave far away from the old one's home, so that people won't recognize them. They grow old, and eventually die, because part of the point of doing it this way was that they don't need to be kept in cold storage, and can (to a limited degree) maintain themselves and the villages that people will eventually inhabit when the Project is over.

>what is black scrawl?

>!The Black Scrawl is a side effect of what happens when a Gestalt loses the ability to connect to Replicants. The Gestalt goes mad and becomes a Shade, and cannot connect to Replicants anymore: that soul is lost. The Replicant dies slowly, and the symptoms of this are what Replicants call the Black Scrawl.!<

>The answer is always the same: don't think about it, it's fantasy magic mixed with "science" to try to make it look sophisticated when some of the characters have existential questions that are far from mind blowing/bending

Honestly, Automata gets more into the existential questions.

        It's pointless that you keep asking what's so profound when stuff gets profound in the next endings. It's like going to opera and after act 1 you angrily stand up and leave grunting about how shallow and pointless the show was.

If you wanna find out, play. If you can't be bothered, don't. Don't ask for us to concentrate it in a pill because that for sure wouldn't do a thing for you.

                You do seem to -theoretically- value your time a lot. Maybe after a whole day jestering around with 19yo anime fans it would be wise to go read some quotes of your french crushes and restore a bit of your ego. This sub isn't new to troll threads but I'm sure nobody dedicated nearly as much time and effort as you did.
        Just because there are some reasons to your questions, I'll answer, but it doesn't seem you're interested really in the answers, just frustrated that you have questions.

1. The gestaltification process is unstable because humans don't really understand it. Like everything scientific, there are a lot of experiments that need to be run in order to comprehend everything. However, the WCS gave humanity a ticking clock and there was no choice but to power through without the proper testing. (You know how people complained about the covid-19 vaccines? Think that but on a "you could just instantly die" scale. Yeah. I get the issue here.) Eventually, the scientists realized that while they could make gestalts, they would go "out-of-sync" with their host bodies right away. This could be due to a number of factors, such as now you have a host body gaining memories that the soul doesn't have, or maybe the host body sustains an injury that the soul doesn't remember, etc. The only way they found to stabilize a gestalt is by a steady infusion of the maso particle, which was brought over by Angelus when he was impaled on Tokyo Tower. However, all maso in the world at this point is corrupted by the watchers. When Nier underwent gestaltification, it was found that he was actually stable, and was in fact the ONLY stable gestalt. They could take maso from him and give it to the other gestalts to stabilize them. However, this assumed that the bodies that the gestalts would be placed into would not go out of sync. By obtaining consciousness, the Replicants themselves went out-of-sync. The black scrawl is a physical manifestation, and the letters that circle around a body are "A", "C", "G", and "T" in the angelic script, showing that this sync is breaking down at the DNA level. Also, no one has White Chlorination Syndrome anymore because all of the corrupted maso has been collected and sent back to the Drakengard universe. This was one of the responsibilities given to the Replicants/Androids after humanity underwent gestaltification, because by not having a soul, Replicants are immune to WCS. Once the root cause of WCS was eliminated (about a hundred years or so before Nier), it was now safe to begin the reunification process.
2. Replicants may not reproduce, but they do age. It's uncertain why they age. And yes, one of the light novels explains that when a child is to be born, the adults to go to sleep and Popola or Devola go to bring the newborn replicant from the Memory Tree.
3. Grimoire Weiss has lost his memories? While this may seem like a convenient narrative device, note that the entire game probably wouldn't have even had to happen if this had not been the case. In addition, the memory loss isn't entirely contrived -- when Nier was all pissed from Yonah being kidnapped, he fought in the room where Weiss was held and actually hit him hard enough to cause the memory loss. Oops.
4. Because would a game be satisfying if you could sit back and let it play for you? There's a reason why people didn't like the battle system in Final Fantasy XII and it never came back -- because you could program it and walk away. How is that a game?
5. As this game originally came out almost a decade before covid-19, it was a much more original concept back then. I get how it may seem a bit contrived now. Unfortunately, we can't go back in time and change things so that the two events are differentiated.
This is a mix media project, lots of answers come from different media within Nier and DoD franchises. 

Some of your questions were answered pretty clearly in ending A, seems like you werenâ€™t paying attention

The other endings will explain more and delve deeper thematically.
Considering the first "ending" isn't actually the ending of the game, you're not actually replaying it. You're continuing play of it. Once you have finished "ending" e, you'll have actually finished the playthrough.
I'm going to go a different route than the other commenters here. By the end of route A, you've really been told all that the game is going to tell you. All of the other lore is going to be found inside of extra material, such as drama CDs and light novels. If you don't like the plot, nothing happening in future routes will change your mind.

So what's the point if you have all of your answers? The emotional nature of what the narrative means.

You see, you know at this point that >!shades are really humans,!< but now you get to hear >!what they're screaming at you as you brutally slaughter them.!< Maybe this won't resonate with you, maybe it will. I found it hit a bit harder in Replicant than when I originally played it since my son was only 8 months old during my replay and I had the post-partum hormones coursing through me that made everything make me emotional. Remembering that >!the little shades dropping coloring books are literal children!< made me lose my shit. Realizing that the shade eggs in the Shadowlord's castle are >!INFANTS LIKE MY SON!<made me have to put the game down for a few hours to collect myself before I could continue. 

Now that he's 3 1/2, I'm getting better about keeping it together and disconnecting from it, but I'm still human, and that sort of thing still affects me. If it doesn't affect, you, cool, I guess? Honestly, I'd rather get my emotional catharsis out this way than reading about school shootings and not just grieve because "that could have been my kid, but thank god it's just fictional" but actually worry because "it could BE my kid next time."
Most of your questions was answered before Ending  A. The others are answered from Drakengard or Books.

Also to me replicant isn't mind bending or that about philosophy (Automata tackles more of those existential questions.) The only existential question that Replicant answers is the Trolley Problem, which it does a great job at making the player question their actions.

        Answered in the books and from Drakengard.

Also if you approach the game with this mindset, that everything needs a 1000 IQ scientific proven explanation to magic, you just don't like the Fantasy genre which I really don't understand why you are here?
            [deleted]
                They use science because it's Earth but 'A Red Dragon feel from the Sky'. So magic entered their world and they use science to do things with it.

Also majority of your questions are dealing with World Building not the plot/story. So if you want to learn about the Lore, play/watch the other games or read the books.
                    [deleted]
                        Never said they're completely separate. Yes they're linked but still different. When you try to answer all these world/lore questions in a game/movies/TV show story, you ruin the pacing and weight of the plot. The exception is books.

Look at LOTR, Star Wars, Dark Souls, Game of Thrones, or Harry Potter. If you have any issue with that, you just don't like fantasy style things my dude.
                            [deleted]
                                Nier is a very small Fandom so idk where you're getting huge from and the fans are always bias. You also haven't even finished the game, so if you don't like it, just stop playing and move to a different game...
Replicant was a bit of a slog for me as well. I stuck with it because I played automata and it was amazing. But considering in replicant you basically replay the game with no changes to gameplay and only a few alterations to the quest stories, I just watched the changes.on YT.

That said, all of the questions you asked have answers. I'm not sure where in the game exactly, probably on a lot of books/records/etc.

Replicants, for example, grow old because they are organic, created from genetic data from the original people. They are not the same as androids.
Because why not?
Route A is only a starting point, please continue playing.

Are you focused on the entire playthrough though? Most of the questions are already answered in both gameplay and in-game documents.

                    Ah...my mistake. Exposition > Show don't tell... I am such a dummy.
                        Way to thank someone for answering a question you asked. Maybe this game and community aren't for you, thats no reason to be a dick to people trying to adress your questions.
                        And how do you expect it to **show** you what it is?? Show the whole scientific process in a cutscene or what? What black scfawl is exactly isn't too relevant to the plot. It's not a story about scientific discovery.
If the game story intrigues you the other routes are worthy

                        Nier is a very small Fandom so idk where you're getting huge from and the fans are always bias. You also haven't even finished the game, so if you don't like it, just stop playing and move to a different game...

        It's stated in the Gestalt Documents I'm pretty sure. If you want the "scientific" reason.
            Youâ€™re such a kind and patient nier fan to this lost redditor who wandered away from the 200 IQ Rick and Morty BigBrainTM fandom.
            Ah...my mistake. Exposition > Show don't tell... I am such a dummy.
                Way to thank someone for answering a question you asked. Maybe this game and community aren't for you, thats no reason to be a dick to people trying to adress your questions.
                And how do you expect it to **show** you what it is?? Show the whole scientific process in a cutscene or what? What black scfawl is exactly isn't too relevant to the plot. It's not a story about scientific discovery.

    I didnâ€™t say it wasnâ€™t. If you donâ€™t see nuance, you donâ€™t see nuance. ðŸ¤·

            Cool. Itâ€™s okay if you donâ€™t see it. You donâ€™t have to impose blindness on people who do. Itâ€™s also okay if you donâ€™t like it.

                    I heard Nier Replicant does a great job at explaining the concepts youâ€™re having trouble understanding. Maybe you can try playing it?

            The burden of convincing you to like a thing is not on existing fans; nobody here gives a shit if you like the game or not. 

Also, what kind of reception did you expect when you enter the conversation with a reductive and poor attitude? 

Plenty of other games out there; go play one of them.

    You do seem to -theoretically- value your time a lot. Maybe after a whole day jestering around with 19yo anime fans it would be wise to go read some quotes of your french crushes and restore a bit of your ego. This sub isn't new to troll threads but I'm sure nobody dedicated nearly as much time and effort as you did.

    They use science because it's Earth but 'A Red Dragon feel from the Sky'. So magic entered their world and they use science to do things with it.

Also majority of your questions are dealing with World Building not the plot/story. So if you want to learn about the Lore, play/watch the other games or read the books.

            Never said they're completely separate. Yes they're linked but still different. When you try to answer all these world/lore questions in a game/movies/TV show story, you ruin the pacing and weight of the plot. The exception is books.
