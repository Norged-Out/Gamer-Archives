[[Why is Fallout 76 Multiplayer]]


I get it, it's an MMO; therefore, it's supposed to be a grind -- which I guess is fun for some people. But this game doesn't FEEL like an MMO; it feels like a single player Fallout which has had multiplayer elements forced into it. 
I really just wanna play this game offline (without the damn combat lag!) with less survival elements (items breaking) and grindy enemy encounters (this auto-level matching by enemies makes it so that encounters use up way more ammo than necessary, and ammo is much harder to come by than in Fallout 4 or New Vegas). Also, I like being able to pause my game! 

It would be one thing if this game offered a different experience which justified the multiplayer/MMO elements, but it doesn't. It was a potentially great single player game which has been forced fed a bunch of annoying design elements which bring down the experience. 

From the style of the game world to the storylines (at least the added dlc that is), there was potential for this to be a fantastic single player game. Instead, we get a game which is mediocre if you play it like a single player game and also not that good of an MMO either...


I've gone back to fallout 4. Messing around with mods do create s different experience for myself as well.
    Do you play on console? Any good PS4 mods which you recommend? (I know that the Playstation doesn't allow a lot of mods...)
        I play on Xbox sorry. But I like the Silent Hill mod, real nights, RU556, crossbows of the Commonwealth, unofficial patch and see through scopes are the main ones I use.
>"But this game doesn't FEEL like an MMO"

That is because it is not an "MMO" (*Massively Multiplayer Online*), it is "MO" (*Multiplayer Online*).

>"it feels like a single player Fallout which has had multiplayer elements forced into it"

You are correct. It is actually Fallout 4 with a multiplayer component that was haphazardly shoehorned in.

I totally agree, but it will never happen. Bethesda is too busy sucking the microtransaction cash-cow teat.
    I‚Äôm happy for people that enjoy it. I really am. And the game really does look beautiful. But the first time I saw another player bound onto the screen like Daffy Duck, I was instantly turned off. I actually considered temporarily paying for the pass that lets you play in your own world just to be able to run around a while and explore. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm spending my money on much else right now, and I don‚Äôt mind paying for content when I‚Äôm enjoying it and getting some kind of value out of it. There‚Äôs just too many other annoyances I can‚Äôt ignore, such as not being able to pause, and being forced to play like I‚Äôm on Survivor mode and micromanaging my eating/drinking/sleeping habits. I can mod FO4 with enough original content to make it look just as good if not better and have a way better story experience as well. Heck, even some of the Creation Club stuff is pretty neat. And of course nothing beats being able to  create my own mods, whether I feel like sharing them or not. FO4ever. üòÅ
Basically because of the dayZ mod event. It's 15 minutes of fame turned fad chasing on it's ear and publishers are still tripping overthemselves to cash in leading to plauges like survival games,  and battle royales that well known IP's now get shoehorned into.
We just wanted co-op Fallout not an MMO and beth wouldn't listen.
The heavy multiplayer focus is what holds this game back so much. I played through a lot of it when it first came out got past level 50, launched a nuke, ect. What bugged me the most is after 50 levels I never felt like I was powerful. It seemed like every enemy was a bullet sponge. Like, why the fuck are basic scorched giving me just as much trouble while I'm in X-01 with a plasma rifle as they were when I was naked with a machete fresh out of the vault? 

Though I have to admit, I picked it back up a couple of weeks ago and have been playing it with my girlfriend and we've been having a blast. I still foresee my same problems with the game being there, but it's fun to play with someone else. 

They really flew too close to the sun with trying to have an empty world that relied solely on player interaction for npcs. They should have stuck to the regular formula and included an optional, 4-man tops, multiplayer. It might have been something truly special then.
It felt to me like a bad mobile grind game with mmo elements forced into it.
    People kept on talking about how if you liked 4, you will probably like 76...but man, I agree, the constant grindiness of the game made it feel like I did nothing everytime I played. 

It's sad cause all this game needs is one mod to just remove the MMO/grind elements of the game, and I would be having so much fun!
        I absolutely agree.
Short story Long:

Fallout 4 was my first Fallout. Passed on it at release because it looked bad graphicly. Got it when it went on sale. Fell in LOVE with the game. Bought all the DLCs. 

Then mods came. Xbox had better Mods so I bought an Xbox and rebought the game and all the DLCs. Wasnt enough. I needed the best mods. Bought a low end gaming PC and rebought Fallout 4 and all the DLCs yet again. 

Fallout 76 was announced. I was STOKED. Found out it was Online only. My enthusiasm crashed. The following weeks/months, I accepted it and was on the hype train. Then the game released. It was a complete mess. My biggest concern was PVP Griefers. Thankfully I didnt ever even get shot at by another player. But the bugs were game breaking. Worse than the bugs was the graphics. They literally hurt my eyes and gave me temporary "kaleidoscope vision". I couldnt really get into the game because I was getting diseases every 5 minutes and always walking a snails pace because of always being over encumbered. Didnt even have room in my home storage. 

I deleted the game and never looked back. That is until a week ago. I redownloaded it and started from scratch. Right away I could tell the graphics were better. Slightly but at least enough to not hurt my eyes. Played it for a couple days and went to Youtube for some tips. 

I started felling like I was playing Fallout 4 again. "Im so glad I decided to try this game again" I thought. I was getting frustrated at times because The enemies felt like they were a few too many at times and they took too many bullets. I found myself always hungry and thirsty. I watched a few Youtube videos and tried some of their tips. I improved a little and kept telling myself that I will learn and eventually get better and more powerful. I even bought the rip off Fallout 1st service to maybe help. At least I could hoard as much junk as I wanted so it would make crafting so much less of an issue. Having the extra space is awesome. But its not enough to help the grind.

I think Im done with this game after today. This game would be AWESOME as a single player OFFLINE game with a "Normal" difficulty level. I dont want to play "Survival Hardcore" difficulty. Its not fun to have to eat and drink every couple minutes. Its not fun to never have enough ammo to fight one location even if you have 5 guns with different ammo types to try not to run out. Its not fun to have to use all that ammo fighting random enemy waves on the way to that one location so that you have nothing but your fists to fight with when you get there. 

Whats worse is that even if you Grind and save up your resources to have enough ammo, its meaningless because your gun that you just repaired to full health, breaks after just a few enemies. I want to feel like Im improving and getting stronger as I level up. Instead I feel like its the enemies getting all my experience and they are the ones leveling up while I get weaker. 

Im sure no one will waste their time reading this long rant, but it felt good typing it after the frustrating night of FO76 I just had.
    Dude, I read that entire rant, and I wholeheartedly agree. I basically had the same experience. Played the game for the first time back in July and was really liking it. Felt like I got a sequel to Fallout 4...only, the more you play, the grindier and less fun it becomes. Enemies take too many bullets (especially after this auto-leveling/level matching update) which in turn makes exploration (my favorite part of Fallout) a pain in the ass to do because every encounter uses up too many resources. 

I don't want a hardcore survival game. I don't want my items to break. I don't want to have to desperately scrounge for ammo (something which I never had to really do in Fallout 3, New Vegas, or 4). I just wanna enjoy the damn game and not constantly lose half my ammo to four enemies.
Because you're more likely to spend money on in-game cosmetics if you see someone else wearing it or decorating their base with it.
With how ass the lore consistency can be in the game, i bet its basically an experimental grounds on what the playerbase wants at this point. Quest wise and maybe creatures(like the big bosses)
    Other than the BoS what lore incostistency is there? The BoS in Appalachia is just Bethesda giving and milking fan service but is in no way breaking the loreü§®
        Base:
Cryolater, (very likely)radium rifle & gamma gun, deathclaws, the specific mirelurk variant, fog crearures (crawlers, anglers, gulpers), (debatable)broadsider, (debatable)tesla rifle, (surprisingly)plasma rifles, (very debatable)plasma cores/gatling, (technically)tesla armor (its abilities was destroyed at F4 though), (likely so)marine combat armor, how FEV "works" in general, floaters(created by the Master), (technically)cryo explosizes.

Atom shop:
X-03 & Ranger armor. i dont look at the shop too hard, just felt itd be unfair to count them as game lore, even if they try making lore for them.

I feel like i forgot something in the list. If you have any questions than ask away, but it'd probably be better to look it up. Almost all the fallout 4s lore is left very vague though, and they can only really be reasoned to an extent.

The one unquestioned F4 lore Ill give is the gamma gun. There's next to nothing on this gun(that I found), but it has to be made by the Children of Atom right? The lack of lore can really imply a lot, so I pick the reasonable conclusion often times.
I recommend just going and playing Fallout 4 then

The game has a lot of problems but you are just describing what the game is and saying that you don't like it

For starters. You have to experience a social game socially, unfortunately, to truly enjoy it. 

You need to rely on the community for advancement. The easiest way to start the game is focus on quests to level up for XP, then try out what weapons you seem interested in. Shotguns, Semi Auto Rifles/Automatic Rifles, Pistols, Melee and start choosing perks when you can for those weapon types. Do public events for caps, visit player vendors to buy ammo if you cannot manage your junk or learn what junk gets you what scrap you need to make ammo for yourself at any tinkerers work bench

Weapons durability was literally only removed from Fallout 4, so don't play Fallout 3 or New Vegas, you won't succeed. 

The idea is to have something to play a little of each day, and spend however long you wanna take to get stuff done

A key complaint is enemies are spongy. And yeah, everyone even with love for Fallout 76 will hear this complaint and at least nod in agreement. But you don't get there by complaints alone
Tbf it is Fallout 4 with multiplayer shoved in and then tweaked to ‚Äújust work‚Äù. It started when F4 was being developed but they wanted to see how sales would be before committing time, resources and people on to it.

That's because it is.
