[[why are there no fallout 76 faction or overall appalachia user flairs in this community]]





Done.

Will edit them later do make them look good on old reddit/maybe have them look like the ones on r/fo76, but if I do that for the 76 ones I wanna do it for all of them.
I hated fallout 76 until I played now I play it almost everyday day
    >I hated fallout 76 until I played 

Many such stories
    i want to like it and play it but im not a fan of multiplayer online games like that, same with ESO

last time i played 76 all i did was look at the lovecraftian horror in that one dungeon, and for nuclear winter (RIP)
        I just play adventure mode and I do it solo I don’t have any friends who play this game and I don’t try to make friends with people in the server. The only time I meet other players is when I do events. Even though it’s says this is a MMO game it doesn’t feel like one. More like a single player game with multiplayer stuff added on if that makes sense.
    This is the problem with some fallout 76 haters
        True don’t knock until you try it
            Nah fuck that. For a solid 3 years it was never worth buying. Now it’s okay. Now it’s worth how much it sells for

            Ok? I said (some)
    I love parts of it, hate others. It feels like hugging a cactus sometimes.
        One thing that does annoy me is the limit on legendary script and gold bullion I can get a day.
    Is the story any good? Not planning on playing with friends but kind of interest, heard good things about the world design
        In my estimation, it's Bethesda's best story implementation in a Fallout game thus far for a number of reasons:

-The main story (Scorched questline) will take you around the map at a steady place. From the Forest to the Cranberry Bog, you will see most of the map just by following it. It reminds me of Obsidian effectively nudging the player across half the map just by the way they structured the story.

-It has a very clear theme: United we stand, divided we fall. You see this again just by uncovering lore and information. It's thorough reinforced every time we go uncover a new faction and their untimely fate.

-It's basically a mystery story up until the last two quests. Uncovering what happened to all the factions is its own motivation.

Plus there's two more questlines that are much more traditional in their structure with choices, missable loot, etc.
            Well Obsidian is less of a nudge and more of a shove in a certain direction for the first act of the game. Can't really go anywhere but where the main story takes you for quite a while due to terrain barriers or incredibly high levelled enemies.

76 is done a lot better in this regard, with showing new players different parts of the map, but allowing a lot of freedom along the way
                I'm currently playing New Vegas for the first time and I feel this a lot. I'm essentially only exploring wherever they tell me to. I don't know if it gets more open in the mid game but to be honest I'm not enjoying myself as much as I thought I would be
                    It doesn't, really. NV isn't really about exploration. It's a curated experience meant to tell a story, and the main quest will take you through or near every relevant place on the map. There's little to see by going elsewhere

Don't let people here fool you into thinking that NV is flawless. It's great for the extra role-playing and writing closer to the original Fallout's, but if you prefer world building and exploration, NV sadly has very little of it
                        I see. I guess it's better to set my expectations correctly then. Thanks for the heads up!
        Yeah it’s pretty good I’d say. Lots of interesting stuff happen. Then you also have the DLC stories are pretty neat too. I like the wasteland story a lot.
        Absolutely.  Bethesda sucks at writing dialog but excels at world building and atmospheric story welling which is what 76 focuses on 99% of the time.
            Those were my favorite parts of FO4. If that's what it's like, I'll make some space and try it out! Thank you.
                Try fallout 76 if you love exploration!!!!
Because this community has plenty of dislike for 76 still.
    Honestly, Ubisoft manages to recycle maps for FarCry into like two games every time. I'd be totally down for a real single-player designed experience FO76 by slapping a polished 76 world and campaign onto the FO4 iteration of the engine so it only had normal Bethesda jank and not additional "we have to deal with servers, multiple players and variable connection speeds between servers" jank. This would probably be the only way I'll ever give 76 a chance. Without playing 76 I can't say how much work would be needed for a good storyline if the multiplayer element was stripped though... from what I see the world looks interesting as ever and the creatures look like a batshit crazy, cool roster.
        It’s a sweet fucking map, tons of interesting creatures, great attention to detail, super neat storytelling, but the only reason I know that is because I like to listen to lore on long drives every now and then

I would love to play it but Fallout 4’s console modding spoiled me. If they were to come out and just add that I’m confident it would quickly rise to my most played game
            What do you listen to fore the lore?
                Everyone I listen to is on YouTube, I listen to longer stories from RadKing, Synonymous, and Oxhorn. I’m also a fan of N_orte and TKs-Mantis

If you’re into short skits I recommend checking out I Am Naiwal, smaller creator that’s getting more popular, pretty funny dude
                    Thanks for the info.
                    Yo Oxhorn is cool, I like his vids
            This is why I never use mods for anything because then it ruins the vanilla game. If those mods ever stop being supported your fucked.
                Fucked how? It doesn't affect the base game in any permanent way, you can just turn them off with no problems for the game.
                    Fucked because you don't enjoy the vanilla game because youve been playing with mods too much. At least for me that's how it is.
        You can play almost the entirety of the content of 76 solo. Only things you're forced to do with others is existing on the same map, events, and operations. All of the quests are designed to be done solo, with no shared progression.
            That’s true, but the entire system is still too geared towards MMO looter-shooter progression and away from character builds and replayability for me to enjoy it. In my first hour of gameplay I intentionally ditched the “find the overseer” main questline only to wander into her house, which was a nice surprise until she told me to beat it until I hit level 20 (something that would be unthinkable in any other Fallout), then I tried and couldn’t kill her or basically any other NPC I found (why are the vault robots “essential”? Why is the couple outside the vault looking for treasure essential?). 

I’m ranting too much here so I’ll digress, but personally it feels too much like Destiny and not enough like Fallout to be worth playing.
                This is the 5% that ruins my want for the game. Having other real players around isn't a big issue, but the compromises the design forced are. It is logical that they would not want me to take a quest away from other players by killing a quest-giver, but they've also taken away my choice to kill that quest-giver. Kind of sacrilege, but I wish they went the GTA 5 path where a well-crafted solo game with a coherent (interesting at least) story is sold and the same map is opened for multiplayer like a month later with its own less long-term stories & such. Like I just can't accept that if I found the Republic of Dave but it was in 76 it sounds like I wouldn't be able to kill anyone or tamper with an election, or lure a deathclaw into the town or cause any long-term changes as they need all choices to be available for all players on the server at all times meaning they've accidentally given all of us basically no choices. Now I just sigh and wait for some saint to recreate the entire 76 map and story from scratch in a FO4 mod because modders are always doing crazy, generous shit.
        The map and environment are amazing. I’d honestly wanna play through the first few years of the world before the scorch plague killed everyone, Bethesda handicapped themselves so hard with their no NPCs idea
        My man you are the definition of don’t think just consume product
            You're helping me realize I should be more specific on this. I do not mean to suggest Ubisoft's game recycling is something great. I mean to point to them jokingly as a precedent that if Ubi could do it to squeeze more green out of the players then it is not unfeasible for Bethesda to do such to offer a separate version of their product that runs better and is tailored to their original audience. Based on what I've read since they've continually been working on undoing the no NPCs fiasco and making the game world more alive/interesting that the majority of still-existing negatives are related to the fact they're trying to duct tape together an older game engine that was never meant for a Fortnite clone to power their Fortnite clone causing extra issues. I read one of the biggest issues was how the engine had a reliance on framerate meaning if they have not fixed it yet two players interacting are each playing by different rules depending on the framerate on their local machines. Now without playing it I do not know how bad these issues actually are today vs negative press from its first release, but I do know the lovable FO4 runs like a bit of a lemon, and that was designed around the engine's intended use. I think a solo targeted rework of the game with their story expansions already built-in and other tweaks would be a relative success for a title that likely undersold as it might be more appealing to a considerable amount of past customers. They do of course have no incentive to do this as despite bragging rights for moving game copies I'm certain the adjustments to "downgrade" the engine are not easy and just as Rockstar all real profits probably come from micro-transactions like Brahmin Armor or something. 

As far as Ubisoft goes Blood Dragon is generally cheap and completely worth the asset flipping. The other two cases were marketed as new games (Primal, New Dawn) & did not look compelling, yet I've not tried either. I'd definitely call New Dawn a cash grab. Primal looked to have some original ideas, but it is kind of dirty to reuse that much of the map and present it as a new game really.
    The community needs to go back and play vanilla versions of the past games. I’ve recently been doing that, and even with 4, it’s incredible how many improvements Bethesda made with 76.
        Mass scrapping, mod system, legendary system, cool bosses, nukes, backpacks, and weapon health were all phenomenal advances in 76. I loved the game and grinded for a long time, only got turned off by my effort to get my final achievement for plat, "I am become death" being slapped away by some a-hole who interacted with the silo first after i solod the whole thing >:(
            >  weapon health were all phenomenal advances in 76.

I disagree. Apart from my opinion on gear durability at large, they implemented gear durability in just about the laziest way possible. Net negative for the title imo.
                I suppose i can understand that. I just truly enkoyed the survivaly aspect of actually needing more of my junk because of durability. Also bulk junk and ammo crafting were really cool
                    I would be less incensed if the mechanics were actually interesting, I.E Kingdom Come's grindstone mechanic. But there's really nothing interesting about it, it's just a little hampster wheel
                        Thats true, I understand your stance for sure
        76 has the best dialogue bethesda has ever made. Compared to 4 is like heaven.
        Yeah, only played Fallout 76 prior to any other games. Finished New Vegaa and liked it, felt similar but way chunkier.

I'm playing Fallout 4 atm. And I'm constantly mind blown over how much they improved the 4th game's formula and made it smoother.. I'm hoarding a bunch of stuff and jokingly just curse with "76 f-ing spoiled me with the improved QoL"

76 is quite fun, just sad that the only truly soloable content, was the main story and a very few selecion of events... otherwise I was hooked by the world given and the story of the game. Trying to piece together what's going on, what happened, why there's no one left besides us, is the overseer alive or not? While checking faction after faction and finding nothing but Scorched, Ghouls, Robots and Corpses. But does it keep me playing? No... because I'm bored of being alone and no friends to play with... I'd 100% replay the entire story, following a friend starting from scratch and give guns & ammo to them which I won't use (I have put all my bets into non-automatic rifles... using a Laser Rifle and Shotgun as back-up for either resistances or when ammo is tight... and honestly, I've not struggled with ammo for A LOOOONG while now xD) and just use my spare materials to upgrade their stuff and repair their stuff, since I got cards for combat, repairs and base building.

Oh... I also made one friend rage at me, because I have the "Quack Surgeon" Card when I'm playing in a group, so I Revived him once with a Vodka bottle and he got addicted to alcohol x'D all laughs and I gave him an addictol.
        I did and it's not even close fallout 4 doesn't involve t posting and skating and terrain glitching the first 5 minutes you play it. 



Compared to 76 fallout 4 was a masterpiece and that's saying something.
            Are you on PC? If not, it sounds like connection issues. I must be one of the only players who doesn’t experience these supposed graphical issues 🤷🏼‍♂️
                I was on Xbox x for the latest, and I have a fairly good connection 500mb down 50 up. 


I have around 20 hours in the game across several months of trying. I have played it on both my PC and Xbox, while the PC looks better it still just is not fun  to find a shotgun that is arbitrarily too high of a level for you. 

The game had so much potential but it just fell short in every imaginably way for me.
                    To each their own
    And i think that should change. Theres plenty of people that play the game. And as this is the central fallout subreddit i think we should put user flairs fitting for everyone
        At least we have 3 other subreddits for our 76 needs
        You can always just go to the 76 subreddit.


Most here do not like it and are still salty that they squandered such a great opportunity.
        You're kinda asking the mods to pander to a game in the series that's more hated than not. It would be like if there were flairs for Brotherhood of Steel. Also, keep in mind there aren't flairs for factions in the other games. I think if they did implement that, it would clutter up the place.
            It's hated by a few who insist they are a majority.
                lol. you're funny. 😁
                    yeah, i know, but with me it's intentional
                O really tell me about those sales figures...
                    [deleted]
                        lol...that's just the number of people who have played it....like ever. Including the ones who hated it. Considering the daily player count hasn't been able to break 10k consistently since it tanked after launch, I'd say it's doing about as well as it always has been.
                            [deleted]
                                Nope, I mean unique. Every time Beth puts those numbers out that they hit some odd millions of players, they're including anyone who has ever played the game. It's just generally understood.

Also, I'm not sure where you're getting your numbers, but [other trackers](https://playercounter.com/fallout-76/) put it at half what you're reporting. Nevertheless, they numbers (whatever tracker you're using) have been stagnating since it tanked after launch (with short term spikes here and there when there's a giveaway, like what is happening right now). Once the XB/PS promo ends, the numbers will probably drop by around half or so like they always do.
                                    [deleted]
                        Number of an people who have played it. "Active players" is a number that you can create your own definition for. 

It isn't bad for a f2p game but only something like 2 million copies sold in the first 2 years.


I'm sure I'm 6 of those active players since played the demo on the PS4 and then played the free version on 2 different PC's  on steam and on gamepass.1
                    The most successful game in the Fallout series, and at one point the most successful game in BGS history-- possibly still-- was 4. That doesn't stop haters. 76 was a sales disappointment, no doubt. But the game is still around, doing well, and still attracts new players. If sales figures measured love, NV would be hated in comparison to the love showered upon 4. Probably 76, too.
    Being from WV, I will forever have a bad taste in my mouth from 76, it’s like they glanced at a map once and then made it from memory, and left out a bunch of cool shit while they were at it
        I lived in NW NC for a time, and yeah, while they missed a lot of specific details, they did get the feel of Appalachia. It does really remind me of my time camping out in the Blue Ridge mountains near Stone Mountain.

I can appreciate your point of view as a WV native.
            Maybe they got a feel for Appalachia as a whole, but I feel as though they missed the mark for WV specifically, which is a big deal seeing as how that’s where the game is set
                I'm in agreement with you.
    I don’t understand why people choose to hangout on a Subreddit for a game they hate. Seems like self punishment to me.
        That's why the 76 haters generally stay away from the 76 subreddits. However, this one is for all the games.
        It's not hate for FO but the bad elements that 76 brings out here.
            What does that even mean?
                There's more to Fallout than just FO76.
            But it’s the bad players who bring out the bad element to start with.

Maybe we should start ‘naughty stepping’ 🤷‍♂️🤷?
        I love fallout. 76 is not fallout. 


76 is a huge opportunity that was squandered.
            So don’t play it. Or more to the point, don’t complain to fans about it. 😊
                And you can just go over to r/fo76 if you want to talk about it. 

I would prefer if this sub stayed focused on the real games.
                    I see what you mean, but this Sub is a general Fallout sub, not specific.
                        Regardless it is what it is. 

I won't go on 76 and complain about it. But this sub is not dedicated to 76.
                            No, it’s dedicated to FALLOUT in general. Not to be rude but this mystery seems to pass you by dear.
                                Ok it's dedicated to fallout with a story and lore. Not a story lacking MMOs.
                                    Let’s just say our good nights (I’m in England) and happy gaming. 😊
                                    76 base game has a story and is choked to the gills with lore before you even add in the updates.
                            Please from now on refrain from talking about New Vegas on this subreddit because it has it's own subreddit and should only be discussed there. Thank you in advance.
                                Except people like new Vegas
                                    Are you really this selfish that you think anyone with a different opinion than you should just not talk about what they like or prefer to play? Seems pretty lonely to me, i pity you.
                            They aren't asking it to be dedicated to 76 though just that there be an option for those that want 76 flairs and such.
                                Well look at how few upvotes the post got...


That should answer your questions.
                                    It doesn't because I didn't have one nor does it mean the sub shouldn't have 76 tags. And now the mods have added them in so looks like it's been decided.
                                    So by your own measures 76 is now a good game, since the post has around 130 upvotes and about 90 comments
                                    Dude look at your dislikes no one agrees with you 😭🤣 talking about "this got no votes" yet you hating on 76 got you -16 on 1 comment alone.
                                    Almost everything ive seen you post on this sub about your opinion is in the negatives so maybe you shouldn't be here if you wanna use that logic
            76 is fallout. especially moreso than 2 or new vegas.
                >especially moreso than 2 or new vegas

Please tell me you're baiting.
                    No.
                        Care to explain why? Do you sincerely believe Fallout is supposed to be a MMO looter shooter with very limited RPG influences instead of a narrative-based RPG?
                            >Do you sincerely believe Fallout is supposed to be a MMO looter shooter with very limited RPG influences instead of a narrative-based RPG?

76 is literally none of that. It's not an mmo, it's just online. It isn't a looter shooter (play borderlands if you want to see what a looter shooter is). And it has a lot of rpg mechanics and influences and is for the most part narrative based for as much as it can be as an online game.

You do know fallout fans have wanted an online game since the early 2000s, right? Even going so far to use fallout 1 and 2 (2's more popular) as a base for an online mmo game? The original creators ("original", i'm pretty sure it was the fallout 2 dev team) also working on an official fallout mmo at the time in 2005?

Fallout isn't defined by its single player aspects. You can dislike online games. I, myself, do. But that doesn't make it not fallout.
                                You still didn't explain what makes 76 "more Fallout" than New Vegas and 2.
                                    76 is consistent with the lore (2 and new vegas aren't). 76 goes hard on the ideals of the franchise (due to its online nature of constant updates and its expansive, massive open world; and 2 and new vegas seem to not really grasp fully fallout's ideals, new vegas moreso than 2).
                    I mean if we’re being honest. Fallout 3 is pretty close to Fallout 1 in setting and theme, Fallout 76 isn’t far behind either due to how it shows how fucked up the world got after being nuked. Fallout 2, New Vegas and 4 are just satires of a nuclear apocalypse. A small section of the fanbase think 1 and 3 are the true Fallout games.
                        1 and 3 are also satire.

2 and new vegas just get lore wrong and don't quite fully understand what it is fallout satirizes and critiques.
                            Fallout 2 and New Vegas is more on the nose with satire is what I mean, it’s obvious it wants it’s satire to be known. Fallout 1 and 3 are more subtle imo.
                                Eh. I guess. At least with 2. They're just not good satires.
                        What seems more like a satire of the setting is that in Fallout 3, more than 200 years after the bombs fell, people are still essentially living in the mud, scavenging old ruins for food and medicine instead of developing or re-discovering ways of creating both, and seemingly incapable of (or unwilling to) rebuild society. What makes 2 and New Vegas so great is that they show the perseverance of humanity, and yet also how fragile society is.
                            Eh, I think Slavers, Super Mutants, Raiders, and also being the Nation’s capital getting nuked to hell would be the reason why people in DC are scraping to get by. Even good Mercs are being taken down(Reily’s Rangers). Rivet City and Tenpenny Tower are the closest to actually trying to rebuild civilization. Other settlements are just living in the moment. Doesn’t explain where food comes from in Fallout 3 though since there’s no farms mentioned in any of the towns.
                Well look at the votes on this suggestion they speak for themselves.
                    you've literally gotten downvoted, the post is upvoted, and the mods added flairs for 76. what the absolute heck is your point?
                        56 comments with 26 upvotes is not very good...


The fact that 6 of you are obsessed with the game and vote down everything that isn't positive for it is meaningless. 


Most people who don't like it didn't even open this thread.
Cue "we don't take kindly to your type around here" meme.
    I think Deliverance has a plethora of material for such memes. 😁
I'm assuming r/fo76 might do something like that if that's what you're seeking. However, this sub just splits it by game, likely to clarify the particular franchise entry, and not so much to "represent". Besides, this particular sub isn't exactly overflowing with 76 fans.
I played a game pretty recent version and I’m still not much a fan. I dislike weapon and arming breaking. I dislike the laggy combat that comes with always being online. And the story just feels incredibly inconsequential to the Fallout universe.
right??? I really like the factions in 76 and want them to be included!!!!
All these 76 haters getting so many dislikes tells me people somewhat like the game 🤣😭don't go off saying "we the majority" just to get ratio'd
    Seriously though, everyday in the 76 subreddit are the most wholesome stories, just today there was one, I say we're better off without these haters ruining our game
I've never understood 76 hate, i get it when it comes out on release, but it's great now. The fallout community is pretty terrible sometimes, but in my experience the 76 community has been the nicest and most welcoming online game community I've ever met. I get it isn't solo, but most stuff can be done solo anyway.. it's a blast with friends, and the content is huge. It definitely isn't a "no mans sky" redemption, but it's definitely a lot better now.
    The hate endures because it still represents everything wrong with Fallout.

1 - Zero fucks given by Bethesda when it comes to quality. Bethesda games being buggy is just 'accepted', but it shouldn't be. Even by their standards, 76 was hot garbage.

2 - No interest in the lore whatsoever. Why are the Brotherhood in 76? Because the Brotherhood are the most recognisable Fallout faction. Why are the Enclave there? Brand recognition. Why are there Super Mutants? Brand recognition. Fallout 76 isn't interested in building upon the deep, complex lore of the franchise; it's wearing Fallout as a skinsuit.

3 - Fucking disgusting, utterly unforgivable monetisation systems.

4 - Fucking disgusting, utterly unforgivable monetisation systems. Yes, I put it twice. No, that wasn't an accident.

5 - Jumping on fucking bandwagons. If there's one thing the latest instalment to a single player, story-driven RPG game series needed, it was Battle Royale. No, I don't care that this mode was shut down - it existed, and that is a permanent black mark on Bethesda.
The Fallout 76 subreddit did that. Makes sense to have some here, though.
I found Fallout 76 to be boring.
    Ok
i quite enjoy 76 id have to say its my favourite fallout game im not joking either
    I have to go ahead and say same
        Whats wrong with that?
            Memes and corporate greed, I think. However, it's nice to know that people enjoy it. It's a game. It's meant to be enjoyed. Even better if they finally polished it (which I think they did last year or so).
Because it'll trigger the manchildren who take a fucking video game so seriously. In other words "BeCaUsE fAlLoUt 76 Is BaD!!!! 🤓"
I think they don’t really care for 76
Tbh I wish they fleshed out the enclave a bit .ore to allow recruitment of settlers.
    Update before last added some big teasers for an upcoming Enclave story update. Looking forward to see what's on the upcoming roadmap.
From all I've heard, the game has improved significantly and I've contemplated picking it up.
The game is ok if not for the server side that causes a lot of glitches and bugs
Cuz FaLlOuT sEvEnTy-SiX bAd!!

(Thank you to u/HunterWorld for being amazing)
Because it's a greed fueled blight on the fallout franchise, and for many marked the end of Bethesda being pro consumer.

If you like it then cool whatever, it's a fine game on it's own. It's not a good fallout game.
Because we hate 76 here 🤷🏻‍♀️🤣
Cause it suck
    Why it suck?

Why u think this
76 is my favorite betheada fallout and unlike ESO it feels like a bethesda game. You can play it solo or with friends, you got story content with great writing and awesome dialogue and the biggest more diverse and better optimized bethesda map ever. More weapons more enemies bigger shootouts. Backpacks photomode and UI improvements. Daily Ops, expeditions, 4 server wide bosses, tons of events, free seasons and free updates.  But the best thing about it is the nicest community ever <3
The game launched in such a shit state that many of us gave up on it. It's decent now, but just awful before
Probably because I would be hard to make a system where multiple people are in a faction doing quest and stuff but the idea of factions in 76 is interesting and would be cool to see like a faction war
    They mean how the user names have flairs for things like the Minutemen, NCR, Legion, Enclave, Institute etc
Bad game
    You know seeing all these fo76 haters getting downvoted gives me hope for a better fallout community.
        It was a joke
            You were prepared to say the joke, you must be prepared to take the consequences of it

    I guess they don’t anymore according to you.
Segregation
I can understand that there’s people who like it or hate it. Am not really an online gaming type of person. If I had played at day one I would of hate the bugs and glitches that are happening in the game. But try to remember this isn’t the first time that Bethesda had bugged games. There are always big mistakes for companies gaming or not. Online or offline. I always prefer single player games then online games. That just me but it’s my opinion. Everyone should have their opinions on this. I made mine. And be honest about it.
    I've played singleplayer games my entire life. Fallout 76 was one of the few expections.
        I tried online games before but it wasn’t much fun for me. I only remember one which is Genshin Impact I played for some time or couple of days. I eventually lost interest in it. And that was before the problems that occurred after I stopped playing. I tried again but I couldn’t get the feeling that I had before. You have to kinda keep people interested for them to keep playing the game. For example Skyrim being still playing to this day plus mods to me make it more fun and interesting.
I love Fallout, played every game since the start but never been able to get excited for 76 since I saw “mmo” attached to it.

I think a lot of hate for 76 stems from an opinion that we could have had a normal Fallout game instead of 76, I certainly prescribe to this.

I will play it eventually because it’s cannon and I love diving into the lore… reading some comments on here got me thinking it might be time but just went to look on PS store and it’s still £60 for 76 and Pitt… it’s not the time lol.
>I hated fallout 76 until I played 

Many such stories
i want to like it and play it but im not a fan of multiplayer online games like that, same with ESO

last time i played 76 all i did was look at the lovecraftian horror in that one dungeon, and for nuclear winter (RIP)
    I just play adventure mode and I do it solo I don’t have any friends who play this game and I don’t try to make friends with people in the server. The only time I meet other players is when I do events. Even though it’s says this is a MMO game it doesn’t feel like one. More like a single player game with multiplayer stuff added on if that makes sense.
This is the problem with some fallout 76 haters
    True don’t knock until you try it
        Nah fuck that. For a solid 3 years it was never worth buying. Now it’s okay. Now it’s worth how much it sells for
    [deleted]
        Ok? I said (some)
I love parts of it, hate others. It feels like hugging a cactus sometimes.
    One thing that does annoy me is the limit on legendary script and gold bullion I can get a day.
Is the story any good? Not planning on playing with friends but kind of interest, heard good things about the world design
    In my estimation, it's Bethesda's best story implementation in a Fallout game thus far for a number of reasons:

-The main story (Scorched questline) will take you around the map at a steady place. From the Forest to the Cranberry Bog, you will see most of the map just by following it. It reminds me of Obsidian effectively nudging the player across half the map just by the way they structured the story.

-It has a very clear theme: United we stand, divided we fall. You see this again just by uncovering lore and information. It's thorough reinforced every time we go uncover a new faction and their untimely fate.

-It's basically a mystery story up until the last two quests. Uncovering what happened to all the factions is its own motivation.

Plus there's two more questlines that are much more traditional in their structure with choices, missable loot, etc.
        Well Obsidian is less of a nudge and more of a shove in a certain direction for the first act of the game. Can't really go anywhere but where the main story takes you for quite a while due to terrain barriers or incredibly high levelled enemies.

76 is done a lot better in this regard, with showing new players different parts of the map, but allowing a lot of freedom along the way
            I'm currently playing New Vegas for the first time and I feel this a lot. I'm essentially only exploring wherever they tell me to. I don't know if it gets more open in the mid game but to be honest I'm not enjoying myself as much as I thought I would be
                It doesn't, really. NV isn't really about exploration. It's a curated experience meant to tell a story, and the main quest will take you through or near every relevant place on the map. There's little to see by going elsewhere

Don't let people here fool you into thinking that NV is flawless. It's great for the extra role-playing and writing closer to the original Fallout's, but if you prefer world building and exploration, NV sadly has very little of it
                    I see. I guess it's better to set my expectations correctly then. Thanks for the heads up!
    Yeah it’s pretty good I’d say. Lots of interesting stuff happen. Then you also have the DLC stories are pretty neat too. I like the wasteland story a lot.
    Absolutely.  Bethesda sucks at writing dialog but excels at world building and atmospheric story welling which is what 76 focuses on 99% of the time.
        Those were my favorite parts of FO4. If that's what it's like, I'll make some space and try it out! Thank you.
            Try fallout 76 if you love exploration!!!!
Honestly, Ubisoft manages to recycle maps for FarCry into like two games every time. I'd be totally down for a real single-player designed experience FO76 by slapping a polished 76 world and campaign onto the FO4 iteration of the engine so it only had normal Bethesda jank and not additional "we have to deal with servers, multiple players and variable connection speeds between servers" jank. This would probably be the only way I'll ever give 76 a chance. Without playing 76 I can't say how much work would be needed for a good storyline if the multiplayer element was stripped though... from what I see the world looks interesting as ever and the creatures look like a batshit crazy, cool roster.
    It’s a sweet fucking map, tons of interesting creatures, great attention to detail, super neat storytelling, but the only reason I know that is because I like to listen to lore on long drives every now and then

I would love to play it but Fallout 4’s console modding spoiled me. If they were to come out and just add that I’m confident it would quickly rise to my most played game
        What do you listen to fore the lore?
            Everyone I listen to is on YouTube, I listen to longer stories from RadKing, Synonymous, and Oxhorn. I’m also a fan of N_orte and TKs-Mantis

If you’re into short skits I recommend checking out I Am Naiwal, smaller creator that’s getting more popular, pretty funny dude
                Thanks for the info.
                Yo Oxhorn is cool, I like his vids
        This is why I never use mods for anything because then it ruins the vanilla game. If those mods ever stop being supported your fucked.
            Fucked how? It doesn't affect the base game in any permanent way, you can just turn them off with no problems for the game.
                Fucked because you don't enjoy the vanilla game because youve been playing with mods too much. At least for me that's how it is.
    You can play almost the entirety of the content of 76 solo. Only things you're forced to do with others is existing on the same map, events, and operations. All of the quests are designed to be done solo, with no shared progression.
        That’s true, but the entire system is still too geared towards MMO looter-shooter progression and away from character builds and replayability for me to enjoy it. In my first hour of gameplay I intentionally ditched the “find the overseer” main questline only to wander into her house, which was a nice surprise until she told me to beat it until I hit level 20 (something that would be unthinkable in any other Fallout), then I tried and couldn’t kill her or basically any other NPC I found (why are the vault robots “essential”? Why is the couple outside the vault looking for treasure essential?). 

I’m ranting too much here so I’ll digress, but personally it feels too much like Destiny and not enough like Fallout to be worth playing.
            This is the 5% that ruins my want for the game. Having other real players around isn't a big issue, but the compromises the design forced are. It is logical that they would not want me to take a quest away from other players by killing a quest-giver, but they've also taken away my choice to kill that quest-giver. Kind of sacrilege, but I wish they went the GTA 5 path where a well-crafted solo game with a coherent (interesting at least) story is sold and the same map is opened for multiplayer like a month later with its own less long-term stories & such. Like I just can't accept that if I found the Republic of Dave but it was in 76 it sounds like I wouldn't be able to kill anyone or tamper with an election, or lure a deathclaw into the town or cause any long-term changes as they need all choices to be available for all players on the server at all times meaning they've accidentally given all of us basically no choices. Now I just sigh and wait for some saint to recreate the entire 76 map and story from scratch in a FO4 mod because modders are always doing crazy, generous shit.
    The map and environment are amazing. I’d honestly wanna play through the first few years of the world before the scorch plague killed everyone, Bethesda handicapped themselves so hard with their no NPCs idea
    My man you are the definition of don’t think just consume product
        You're helping me realize I should be more specific on this. I do not mean to suggest Ubisoft's game recycling is something great. I mean to point to them jokingly as a precedent that if Ubi could do it to squeeze more green out of the players then it is not unfeasible for Bethesda to do such to offer a separate version of their product that runs better and is tailored to their original audience. Based on what I've read since they've continually been working on undoing the no NPCs fiasco and making the game world more alive/interesting that the majority of still-existing negatives are related to the fact they're trying to duct tape together an older game engine that was never meant for a Fortnite clone to power their Fortnite clone causing extra issues. I read one of the biggest issues was how the engine had a reliance on framerate meaning if they have not fixed it yet two players interacting are each playing by different rules depending on the framerate on their local machines. Now without playing it I do not know how bad these issues actually are today vs negative press from its first release, but I do know the lovable FO4 runs like a bit of a lemon, and that was designed around the engine's intended use. I think a solo targeted rework of the game with their story expansions already built-in and other tweaks would be a relative success for a title that likely undersold as it might be more appealing to a considerable amount of past customers. They do of course have no incentive to do this as despite bragging rights for moving game copies I'm certain the adjustments to "downgrade" the engine are not easy and just as Rockstar all real profits probably come from micro-transactions like Brahmin Armor or something. 

As far as Ubisoft goes Blood Dragon is generally cheap and completely worth the asset flipping. The other two cases were marketed as new games (Primal, New Dawn) & did not look compelling, yet I've not tried either. I'd definitely call New Dawn a cash grab. Primal looked to have some original ideas, but it is kind of dirty to reuse that much of the map and present it as a new game really.
The community needs to go back and play vanilla versions of the past games. I’ve recently been doing that, and even with 4, it’s incredible how many improvements Bethesda made with 76.
    Mass scrapping, mod system, legendary system, cool bosses, nukes, backpacks, and weapon health were all phenomenal advances in 76. I loved the game and grinded for a long time, only got turned off by my effort to get my final achievement for plat, "I am become death" being slapped away by some a-hole who interacted with the silo first after i solod the whole thing >:(
        >  weapon health were all phenomenal advances in 76.

I disagree. Apart from my opinion on gear durability at large, they implemented gear durability in just about the laziest way possible. Net negative for the title imo.
            I suppose i can understand that. I just truly enkoyed the survivaly aspect of actually needing more of my junk because of durability. Also bulk junk and ammo crafting were really cool
                I would be less incensed if the mechanics were actually interesting, I.E Kingdom Come's grindstone mechanic. But there's really nothing interesting about it, it's just a little hampster wheel
                    Thats true, I understand your stance for sure
    76 has the best dialogue bethesda has ever made. Compared to 4 is like heaven.
    Yeah, only played Fallout 76 prior to any other games. Finished New Vegaa and liked it, felt similar but way chunkier.

I'm playing Fallout 4 atm. And I'm constantly mind blown over how much they improved the 4th game's formula and made it smoother.. I'm hoarding a bunch of stuff and jokingly just curse with "76 f-ing spoiled me with the improved QoL"

76 is quite fun, just sad that the only truly soloable content, was the main story and a very few selecion of events... otherwise I was hooked by the world given and the story of the game. Trying to piece together what's going on, what happened, why there's no one left besides us, is the overseer alive or not? While checking faction after faction and finding nothing but Scorched, Ghouls, Robots and Corpses. But does it keep me playing? No... because I'm bored of being alone and no friends to play with... I'd 100% replay the entire story, following a friend starting from scratch and give guns & ammo to them which I won't use (I have put all my bets into non-automatic rifles... using a Laser Rifle and Shotgun as back-up for either resistances or when ammo is tight... and honestly, I've not struggled with ammo for A LOOOONG while now xD) and just use my spare materials to upgrade their stuff and repair their stuff, since I got cards for combat, repairs and base building.

Oh... I also made one friend rage at me, because I have the "Quack Surgeon" Card when I'm playing in a group, so I Revived him once with a Vodka bottle and he got addicted to alcohol x'D all laughs and I gave him an addictol.
    I did and it's not even close fallout 4 doesn't involve t posting and skating and terrain glitching the first 5 minutes you play it. 



Compared to 76 fallout 4 was a masterpiece and that's saying something.
        Are you on PC? If not, it sounds like connection issues. I must be one of the only players who doesn’t experience these supposed graphical issues 🤷🏼‍♂️
            I was on Xbox x for the latest, and I have a fairly good connection 500mb down 50 up. 


I have around 20 hours in the game across several months of trying. I have played it on both my PC and Xbox, while the PC looks better it still just is not fun  to find a shotgun that is arbitrarily too high of a level for you. 

The game had so much potential but it just fell short in every imaginably way for me.
                To each their own
And i think that should change. Theres plenty of people that play the game. And as this is the central fallout subreddit i think we should put user flairs fitting for everyone
    At least we have 3 other subreddits for our 76 needs
    You can always just go to the 76 subreddit.


Most here do not like it and are still salty that they squandered such a great opportunity.
    You're kinda asking the mods to pander to a game in the series that's more hated than not. It would be like if there were flairs for Brotherhood of Steel. Also, keep in mind there aren't flairs for factions in the other games. I think if they did implement that, it would clutter up the place.
        It's hated by a few who insist they are a majority.
            lol. you're funny. 😁
                yeah, i know, but with me it's intentional
            O really tell me about those sales figures...
                [deleted]
                    lol...that's just the number of people who have played it....like ever. Including the ones who hated it. Considering the daily player count hasn't been able to break 10k consistently since it tanked after launch, I'd say it's doing about as well as it always has been.
                        [deleted]
                            Nope, I mean unique. Every time Beth puts those numbers out that they hit some odd millions of players, they're including anyone who has ever played the game. It's just generally understood.

Also, I'm not sure where you're getting your numbers, but [other trackers](https://playercounter.com/fallout-76/) put it at half what you're reporting. Nevertheless, they numbers (whatever tracker you're using) have been stagnating since it tanked after launch (with short term spikes here and there when there's a giveaway, like what is happening right now). Once the XB/PS promo ends, the numbers will probably drop by around half or so like they always do.
                                [deleted]
                    Number of an people who have played it. "Active players" is a number that you can create your own definition for. 

It isn't bad for a f2p game but only something like 2 million copies sold in the first 2 years.


I'm sure I'm 6 of those active players since played the demo on the PS4 and then played the free version on 2 different PC's  on steam and on gamepass.1
                The most successful game in the Fallout series, and at one point the most successful game in BGS history-- possibly still-- was 4. That doesn't stop haters. 76 was a sales disappointment, no doubt. But the game is still around, doing well, and still attracts new players. If sales figures measured love, NV would be hated in comparison to the love showered upon 4. Probably 76, too.
Being from WV, I will forever have a bad taste in my mouth from 76, it’s like they glanced at a map once and then made it from memory, and left out a bunch of cool shit while they were at it
    I lived in NW NC for a time, and yeah, while they missed a lot of specific details, they did get the feel of Appalachia. It does really remind me of my time camping out in the Blue Ridge mountains near Stone Mountain.

I can appreciate your point of view as a WV native.
        Maybe they got a feel for Appalachia as a whole, but I feel as though they missed the mark for WV specifically, which is a big deal seeing as how that’s where the game is set
            I'm in agreement with you.
I don’t understand why people choose to hangout on a Subreddit for a game they hate. Seems like self punishment to me.
    That's why the 76 haters generally stay away from the 76 subreddits. However, this one is for all the games.
    It's not hate for FO but the bad elements that 76 brings out here.
        What does that even mean?
            There's more to Fallout than just FO76.
        But it’s the bad players who bring out the bad element to start with.

Maybe we should start ‘naughty stepping’ 🤷‍♂️🤷?
    I love fallout. 76 is not fallout. 


76 is a huge opportunity that was squandered.
        So don’t play it. Or more to the point, don’t complain to fans about it. 😊
            And you can just go over to r/fo76 if you want to talk about it. 

I would prefer if this sub stayed focused on the real games.
                I see what you mean, but this Sub is a general Fallout sub, not specific.
                    Regardless it is what it is. 

I won't go on 76 and complain about it. But this sub is not dedicated to 76.
                        No, it’s dedicated to FALLOUT in general. Not to be rude but this mystery seems to pass you by dear.
                            Ok it's dedicated to fallout with a story and lore. Not a story lacking MMOs.
                                Let’s just say our good nights (I’m in England) and happy gaming. 😊
                                76 base game has a story and is choked to the gills with lore before you even add in the updates.
                        Please from now on refrain from talking about New Vegas on this subreddit because it has it's own subreddit and should only be discussed there. Thank you in advance.
                            Except people like new Vegas
                                Are you really this selfish that you think anyone with a different opinion than you should just not talk about what they like or prefer to play? Seems pretty lonely to me, i pity you.
                        They aren't asking it to be dedicated to 76 though just that there be an option for those that want 76 flairs and such.
                            Well look at how few upvotes the post got...


That should answer your questions.
                                It doesn't because I didn't have one nor does it mean the sub shouldn't have 76 tags. And now the mods have added them in so looks like it's been decided.
                                So by your own measures 76 is now a good game, since the post has around 130 upvotes and about 90 comments
                                Dude look at your dislikes no one agrees with you 😭🤣 talking about "this got no votes" yet you hating on 76 got you -16 on 1 comment alone.
                                Almost everything ive seen you post on this sub about your opinion is in the negatives so maybe you shouldn't be here if you wanna use that logic
        76 is fallout. especially moreso than 2 or new vegas.
            >especially moreso than 2 or new vegas

Please tell me you're baiting.
                No.
                    Care to explain why? Do you sincerely believe Fallout is supposed to be a MMO looter shooter with very limited RPG influences instead of a narrative-based RPG?
                        >Do you sincerely believe Fallout is supposed to be a MMO looter shooter with very limited RPG influences instead of a narrative-based RPG?

76 is literally none of that. It's not an mmo, it's just online. It isn't a looter shooter (play borderlands if you want to see what a looter shooter is). And it has a lot of rpg mechanics and influences and is for the most part narrative based for as much as it can be as an online game.

You do know fallout fans have wanted an online game since the early 2000s, right? Even going so far to use fallout 1 and 2 (2's more popular) as a base for an online mmo game? The original creators ("original", i'm pretty sure it was the fallout 2 dev team) also working on an official fallout mmo at the time in 2005?

Fallout isn't defined by its single player aspects. You can dislike online games. I, myself, do. But that doesn't make it not fallout.
                            You still didn't explain what makes 76 "more Fallout" than New Vegas and 2.
                                76 is consistent with the lore (2 and new vegas aren't). 76 goes hard on the ideals of the franchise (due to its online nature of constant updates and its expansive, massive open world; and 2 and new vegas seem to not really grasp fully fallout's ideals, new vegas moreso than 2).
                I mean if we’re being honest. Fallout 3 is pretty close to Fallout 1 in setting and theme, Fallout 76 isn’t far behind either due to how it shows how fucked up the world got after being nuked. Fallout 2, New Vegas and 4 are just satires of a nuclear apocalypse. A small section of the fanbase think 1 and 3 are the true Fallout games.
                    1 and 3 are also satire.

2 and new vegas just get lore wrong and don't quite fully understand what it is fallout satirizes and critiques.
                        Fallout 2 and New Vegas is more on the nose with satire is what I mean, it’s obvious it wants it’s satire to be known. Fallout 1 and 3 are more subtle imo.
                            Eh. I guess. At least with 2. They're just not good satires.
                    What seems more like a satire of the setting is that in Fallout 3, more than 200 years after the bombs fell, people are still essentially living in the mud, scavenging old ruins for food and medicine instead of developing or re-discovering ways of creating both, and seemingly incapable of (or unwilling to) rebuild society. What makes 2 and New Vegas so great is that they show the perseverance of humanity, and yet also how fragile society is.
                        Eh, I think Slavers, Super Mutants, Raiders, and also being the Nation’s capital getting nuked to hell would be the reason why people in DC are scraping to get by. Even good Mercs are being taken down(Reily’s Rangers). Rivet City and Tenpenny Tower are the closest to actually trying to rebuild civilization. Other settlements are just living in the moment. Doesn’t explain where food comes from in Fallout 3 though since there’s no farms mentioned in any of the towns.
            Well look at the votes on this suggestion they speak for themselves.
                you've literally gotten downvoted, the post is upvoted, and the mods added flairs for 76. what the absolute heck is your point?
                    56 comments with 26 upvotes is not very good...


The fact that 6 of you are obsessed with the game and vote down everything that isn't positive for it is meaningless. 


Most people who don't like it didn't even open this thread.
I think Deliverance has a plethora of material for such memes. 😁
Seriously though, everyday in the 76 subreddit are the most wholesome stories, just today there was one, I say we're better off without these haters ruining our game
The hate endures because it still represents everything wrong with Fallout.

1 - Zero fucks given by Bethesda when it comes to quality. Bethesda games being buggy is just 'accepted', but it shouldn't be. Even by their standards, 76 was hot garbage.

2 - No interest in the lore whatsoever. Why are the Brotherhood in 76? Because the Brotherhood are the most recognisable Fallout faction. Why are the Enclave there? Brand recognition. Why are there Super Mutants? Brand recognition. Fallout 76 isn't interested in building upon the deep, complex lore of the franchise; it's wearing Fallout as a skinsuit.

3 - Fucking disgusting, utterly unforgivable monetisation systems.

4 - Fucking disgusting, utterly unforgivable monetisation systems. Yes, I put it twice. No, that wasn't an accident.

5 - Jumping on fucking bandwagons. If there's one thing the latest instalment to a single player, story-driven RPG game series needed, it was Battle Royale. No, I don't care that this mode was shut down - it existed, and that is a permanent black mark on Bethesda.
Ok
I have to go ahead and say same
    Whats wrong with that?
        Memes and corporate greed, I think. However, it's nice to know that people enjoy it. It's a game. It's meant to be enjoyed. Even better if they finally polished it (which I think they did last year or so).
Update before last added some big teasers for an upcoming Enclave story update. Looking forward to see what's on the upcoming roadmap.
Why it suck?

Why u think this
They mean how the user names have flairs for things like the Minutemen, NCR, Legion, Enclave, Institute etc
You know seeing all these fo76 haters getting downvoted gives me hope for a better fallout community.
    It was a joke
        You were prepared to say the joke, you must be prepared to take the consequences of it
        Schrodinger’s douchebag moment
I guess they don’t anymore according to you.
I've played singleplayer games my entire life. Fallout 76 was one of the few expections.
    I tried online games before but it wasn’t much fun for me. I only remember one which is Genshin Impact I played for some time or couple of days. I eventually lost interest in it. And that was before the problems that occurred after I stopped playing. I tried again but I couldn’t get the feeling that I had before. You have to kinda keep people interested for them to keep playing the game. For example Skyrim being still playing to this day plus mods to me make it more fun and interesting.
I just play adventure mode and I do it solo I don’t have any friends who play this game and I don’t try to make friends with people in the server. The only time I meet other players is when I do events. Even though it’s says this is a MMO game it doesn’t feel like one. More like a single player game with multiplayer stuff added on if that makes sense.
True don’t knock until you try it
    Nah fuck that. For a solid 3 years it was never worth buying. Now it’s okay. Now it’s worth how much it sells for

    Ok? I said (some)
One thing that does annoy me is the limit on legendary script and gold bullion I can get a day.
In my estimation, it's Bethesda's best story implementation in a Fallout game thus far for a number of reasons:

-The main story (Scorched questline) will take you around the map at a steady place. From the Forest to the Cranberry Bog, you will see most of the map just by following it. It reminds me of Obsidian effectively nudging the player across half the map just by the way they structured the story.

-It has a very clear theme: United we stand, divided we fall. You see this again just by uncovering lore and information. It's thorough reinforced every time we go uncover a new faction and their untimely fate.

-It's basically a mystery story up until the last two quests. Uncovering what happened to all the factions is its own motivation.

Plus there's two more questlines that are much more traditional in their structure with choices, missable loot, etc.
    Well Obsidian is less of a nudge and more of a shove in a certain direction for the first act of the game. Can't really go anywhere but where the main story takes you for quite a while due to terrain barriers or incredibly high levelled enemies.

76 is done a lot better in this regard, with showing new players different parts of the map, but allowing a lot of freedom along the way
        I'm currently playing New Vegas for the first time and I feel this a lot. I'm essentially only exploring wherever they tell me to. I don't know if it gets more open in the mid game but to be honest I'm not enjoying myself as much as I thought I would be
            It doesn't, really. NV isn't really about exploration. It's a curated experience meant to tell a story, and the main quest will take you through or near every relevant place on the map. There's little to see by going elsewhere

Don't let people here fool you into thinking that NV is flawless. It's great for the extra role-playing and writing closer to the original Fallout's, but if you prefer world building and exploration, NV sadly has very little of it
                I see. I guess it's better to set my expectations correctly then. Thanks for the heads up!
Yeah it’s pretty good I’d say. Lots of interesting stuff happen. Then you also have the DLC stories are pretty neat too. I like the wasteland story a lot.
Absolutely.  Bethesda sucks at writing dialog but excels at world building and atmospheric story welling which is what 76 focuses on 99% of the time.
    Those were my favorite parts of FO4. If that's what it's like, I'll make some space and try it out! Thank you.
        Try fallout 76 if you love exploration!!!!
It’s a sweet fucking map, tons of interesting creatures, great attention to detail, super neat storytelling, but the only reason I know that is because I like to listen to lore on long drives every now and then

I would love to play it but Fallout 4’s console modding spoiled me. If they were to come out and just add that I’m confident it would quickly rise to my most played game
    What do you listen to fore the lore?
        Everyone I listen to is on YouTube, I listen to longer stories from RadKing, Synonymous, and Oxhorn. I’m also a fan of N_orte and TKs-Mantis

If you’re into short skits I recommend checking out I Am Naiwal, smaller creator that’s getting more popular, pretty funny dude
            Thanks for the info.
            Yo Oxhorn is cool, I like his vids
    This is why I never use mods for anything because then it ruins the vanilla game. If those mods ever stop being supported your fucked.
        Fucked how? It doesn't affect the base game in any permanent way, you can just turn them off with no problems for the game.
            Fucked because you don't enjoy the vanilla game because youve been playing with mods too much. At least for me that's how it is.
You can play almost the entirety of the content of 76 solo. Only things you're forced to do with others is existing on the same map, events, and operations. All of the quests are designed to be done solo, with no shared progression.
    That’s true, but the entire system is still too geared towards MMO looter-shooter progression and away from character builds and replayability for me to enjoy it. In my first hour of gameplay I intentionally ditched the “find the overseer” main questline only to wander into her house, which was a nice surprise until she told me to beat it until I hit level 20 (something that would be unthinkable in any other Fallout), then I tried and couldn’t kill her or basically any other NPC I found (why are the vault robots “essential”? Why is the couple outside the vault looking for treasure essential?). 

I’m ranting too much here so I’ll digress, but personally it feels too much like Destiny and not enough like Fallout to be worth playing.
        This is the 5% that ruins my want for the game. Having other real players around isn't a big issue, but the compromises the design forced are. It is logical that they would not want me to take a quest away from other players by killing a quest-giver, but they've also taken away my choice to kill that quest-giver. Kind of sacrilege, but I wish they went the GTA 5 path where a well-crafted solo game with a coherent (interesting at least) story is sold and the same map is opened for multiplayer like a month later with its own less long-term stories & such. Like I just can't accept that if I found the Republic of Dave but it was in 76 it sounds like I wouldn't be able to kill anyone or tamper with an election, or lure a deathclaw into the town or cause any long-term changes as they need all choices to be available for all players on the server at all times meaning they've accidentally given all of us basically no choices. Now I just sigh and wait for some saint to recreate the entire 76 map and story from scratch in a FO4 mod because modders are always doing crazy, generous shit.
The map and environment are amazing. I’d honestly wanna play through the first few years of the world before the scorch plague killed everyone, Bethesda handicapped themselves so hard with their no NPCs idea
My man you are the definition of don’t think just consume product
    You're helping me realize I should be more specific on this. I do not mean to suggest Ubisoft's game recycling is something great. I mean to point to them jokingly as a precedent that if Ubi could do it to squeeze more green out of the players then it is not unfeasible for Bethesda to do such to offer a separate version of their product that runs better and is tailored to their original audience. Based on what I've read since they've continually been working on undoing the no NPCs fiasco and making the game world more alive/interesting that the majority of still-existing negatives are related to the fact they're trying to duct tape together an older game engine that was never meant for a Fortnite clone to power their Fortnite clone causing extra issues. I read one of the biggest issues was how the engine had a reliance on framerate meaning if they have not fixed it yet two players interacting are each playing by different rules depending on the framerate on their local machines. Now without playing it I do not know how bad these issues actually are today vs negative press from its first release, but I do know the lovable FO4 runs like a bit of a lemon, and that was designed around the engine's intended use. I think a solo targeted rework of the game with their story expansions already built-in and other tweaks would be a relative success for a title that likely undersold as it might be more appealing to a considerable amount of past customers. They do of course have no incentive to do this as despite bragging rights for moving game copies I'm certain the adjustments to "downgrade" the engine are not easy and just as Rockstar all real profits probably come from micro-transactions like Brahmin Armor or something. 

As far as Ubisoft goes Blood Dragon is generally cheap and completely worth the asset flipping. The other two cases were marketed as new games (Primal, New Dawn) & did not look compelling, yet I've not tried either. I'd definitely call New Dawn a cash grab. Primal looked to have some original ideas, but it is kind of dirty to reuse that much of the map and present it as a new game really.
Mass scrapping, mod system, legendary system, cool bosses, nukes, backpacks, and weapon health were all phenomenal advances in 76. I loved the game and grinded for a long time, only got turned off by my effort to get my final achievement for plat, "I am become death" being slapped away by some a-hole who interacted with the silo first after i solod the whole thing >:(
    >  weapon health were all phenomenal advances in 76.

I disagree. Apart from my opinion on gear durability at large, they implemented gear durability in just about the laziest way possible. Net negative for the title imo.
        I suppose i can understand that. I just truly enkoyed the survivaly aspect of actually needing more of my junk because of durability. Also bulk junk and ammo crafting were really cool
            I would be less incensed if the mechanics were actually interesting, I.E Kingdom Come's grindstone mechanic. But there's really nothing interesting about it, it's just a little hampster wheel
                Thats true, I understand your stance for sure
76 has the best dialogue bethesda has ever made. Compared to 4 is like heaven.
Yeah, only played Fallout 76 prior to any other games. Finished New Vegaa and liked it, felt similar but way chunkier.

I'm playing Fallout 4 atm. And I'm constantly mind blown over how much they improved the 4th game's formula and made it smoother.. I'm hoarding a bunch of stuff and jokingly just curse with "76 f-ing spoiled me with the improved QoL"

76 is quite fun, just sad that the only truly soloable content, was the main story and a very few selecion of events... otherwise I was hooked by the world given and the story of the game. Trying to piece together what's going on, what happened, why there's no one left besides us, is the overseer alive or not? While checking faction after faction and finding nothing but Scorched, Ghouls, Robots and Corpses. But does it keep me playing? No... because I'm bored of being alone and no friends to play with... I'd 100% replay the entire story, following a friend starting from scratch and give guns & ammo to them which I won't use (I have put all my bets into non-automatic rifles... using a Laser Rifle and Shotgun as back-up for either resistances or when ammo is tight... and honestly, I've not struggled with ammo for A LOOOONG while now xD) and just use my spare materials to upgrade their stuff and repair their stuff, since I got cards for combat, repairs and base building.

Oh... I also made one friend rage at me, because I have the "Quack Surgeon" Card when I'm playing in a group, so I Revived him once with a Vodka bottle and he got addicted to alcohol x'D all laughs and I gave him an addictol.
I did and it's not even close fallout 4 doesn't involve t posting and skating and terrain glitching the first 5 minutes you play it. 



Compared to 76 fallout 4 was a masterpiece and that's saying something.
    Are you on PC? If not, it sounds like connection issues. I must be one of the only players who doesn’t experience these supposed graphical issues 🤷🏼‍♂️
        I was on Xbox x for the latest, and I have a fairly good connection 500mb down 50 up. 


I have around 20 hours in the game across several months of trying. I have played it on both my PC and Xbox, while the PC looks better it still just is not fun  to find a shotgun that is arbitrarily too high of a level for you. 

The game had so much potential but it just fell short in every imaginably way for me.
            To each their own
At least we have 3 other subreddits for our 76 needs
You can always just go to the 76 subreddit.


Most here do not like it and are still salty that they squandered such a great opportunity.
You're kinda asking the mods to pander to a game in the series that's more hated than not. It would be like if there were flairs for Brotherhood of Steel. Also, keep in mind there aren't flairs for factions in the other games. I think if they did implement that, it would clutter up the place.
    It's hated by a few who insist they are a majority.
        lol. you're funny. 😁
            yeah, i know, but with me it's intentional
        O really tell me about those sales figures...
            [deleted]
                lol...that's just the number of people who have played it....like ever. Including the ones who hated it. Considering the daily player count hasn't been able to break 10k consistently since it tanked after launch, I'd say it's doing about as well as it always has been.
                    [deleted]
                        Nope, I mean unique. Every time Beth puts those numbers out that they hit some odd millions of players, they're including anyone who has ever played the game. It's just generally understood.

Also, I'm not sure where you're getting your numbers, but [other trackers](https://playercounter.com/fallout-76/) put it at half what you're reporting. Nevertheless, they numbers (whatever tracker you're using) have been stagnating since it tanked after launch (with short term spikes here and there when there's a giveaway, like what is happening right now). Once the XB/PS promo ends, the numbers will probably drop by around half or so like they always do.
                            [deleted]
                Number of an people who have played it. "Active players" is a number that you can create your own definition for. 

It isn't bad for a f2p game but only something like 2 million copies sold in the first 2 years.


I'm sure I'm 6 of those active players since played the demo on the PS4 and then played the free version on 2 different PC's  on steam and on gamepass.1
            The most successful game in the Fallout series, and at one point the most successful game in BGS history-- possibly still-- was 4. That doesn't stop haters. 76 was a sales disappointment, no doubt. But the game is still around, doing well, and still attracts new players. If sales figures measured love, NV would be hated in comparison to the love showered upon 4. Probably 76, too.
I lived in NW NC for a time, and yeah, while they missed a lot of specific details, they did get the feel of Appalachia. It does really remind me of my time camping out in the Blue Ridge mountains near Stone Mountain.

I can appreciate your point of view as a WV native.
    Maybe they got a feel for Appalachia as a whole, but I feel as though they missed the mark for WV specifically, which is a big deal seeing as how that’s where the game is set
        I'm in agreement with you.
That's why the 76 haters generally stay away from the 76 subreddits. However, this one is for all the games.
It's not hate for FO but the bad elements that 76 brings out here.
    What does that even mean?
        There's more to Fallout than just FO76.
    But it’s the bad players who bring out the bad element to start with.

Maybe we should start ‘naughty stepping’ 🤷‍♂️🤷?
I love fallout. 76 is not fallout. 


76 is a huge opportunity that was squandered.
    So don’t play it. Or more to the point, don’t complain to fans about it. 😊
        And you can just go over to r/fo76 if you want to talk about it. 

I would prefer if this sub stayed focused on the real games.
            I see what you mean, but this Sub is a general Fallout sub, not specific.
                Regardless it is what it is. 

I won't go on 76 and complain about it. But this sub is not dedicated to 76.
                    No, it’s dedicated to FALLOUT in general. Not to be rude but this mystery seems to pass you by dear.
                        Ok it's dedicated to fallout with a story and lore. Not a story lacking MMOs.
                            Let’s just say our good nights (I’m in England) and happy gaming. 😊
                            76 base game has a story and is choked to the gills with lore before you even add in the updates.
                    Please from now on refrain from talking about New Vegas on this subreddit because it has it's own subreddit and should only be discussed there. Thank you in advance.
                        Except people like new Vegas
                            Are you really this selfish that you think anyone with a different opinion than you should just not talk about what they like or prefer to play? Seems pretty lonely to me, i pity you.
                    They aren't asking it to be dedicated to 76 though just that there be an option for those that want 76 flairs and such.
                        Well look at how few upvotes the post got...


That should answer your questions.
                            It doesn't because I didn't have one nor does it mean the sub shouldn't have 76 tags. And now the mods have added them in so looks like it's been decided.
                            So by your own measures 76 is now a good game, since the post has around 130 upvotes and about 90 comments
                            Dude look at your dislikes no one agrees with you 😭🤣 talking about "this got no votes" yet you hating on 76 got you -16 on 1 comment alone.
                            Almost everything ive seen you post on this sub about your opinion is in the negatives so maybe you shouldn't be here if you wanna use that logic
    76 is fallout. especially moreso than 2 or new vegas.
        >especially moreso than 2 or new vegas

Please tell me you're baiting.
            No.
                Care to explain why? Do you sincerely believe Fallout is supposed to be a MMO looter shooter with very limited RPG influences instead of a narrative-based RPG?
                    >Do you sincerely believe Fallout is supposed to be a MMO looter shooter with very limited RPG influences instead of a narrative-based RPG?

76 is literally none of that. It's not an mmo, it's just online. It isn't a looter shooter (play borderlands if you want to see what a looter shooter is). And it has a lot of rpg mechanics and influences and is for the most part narrative based for as much as it can be as an online game.

You do know fallout fans have wanted an online game since the early 2000s, right? Even going so far to use fallout 1 and 2 (2's more popular) as a base for an online mmo game? The original creators ("original", i'm pretty sure it was the fallout 2 dev team) also working on an official fallout mmo at the time in 2005?

Fallout isn't defined by its single player aspects. You can dislike online games. I, myself, do. But that doesn't make it not fallout.
                        You still didn't explain what makes 76 "more Fallout" than New Vegas and 2.
                            76 is consistent with the lore (2 and new vegas aren't). 76 goes hard on the ideals of the franchise (due to its online nature of constant updates and its expansive, massive open world; and 2 and new vegas seem to not really grasp fully fallout's ideals, new vegas moreso than 2).
            I mean if we’re being honest. Fallout 3 is pretty close to Fallout 1 in setting and theme, Fallout 76 isn’t far behind either due to how it shows how fucked up the world got after being nuked. Fallout 2, New Vegas and 4 are just satires of a nuclear apocalypse. A small section of the fanbase think 1 and 3 are the true Fallout games.
                1 and 3 are also satire.

2 and new vegas just get lore wrong and don't quite fully understand what it is fallout satirizes and critiques.
                    Fallout 2 and New Vegas is more on the nose with satire is what I mean, it’s obvious it wants it’s satire to be known. Fallout 1 and 3 are more subtle imo.
                        Eh. I guess. At least with 2. They're just not good satires.
                What seems more like a satire of the setting is that in Fallout 3, more than 200 years after the bombs fell, people are still essentially living in the mud, scavenging old ruins for food and medicine instead of developing or re-discovering ways of creating both, and seemingly incapable of (or unwilling to) rebuild society. What makes 2 and New Vegas so great is that they show the perseverance of humanity, and yet also how fragile society is.
                    Eh, I think Slavers, Super Mutants, Raiders, and also being the Nation’s capital getting nuked to hell would be the reason why people in DC are scraping to get by. Even good Mercs are being taken down(Reily’s Rangers). Rivet City and Tenpenny Tower are the closest to actually trying to rebuild civilization. Other settlements are just living in the moment. Doesn’t explain where food comes from in Fallout 3 though since there’s no farms mentioned in any of the towns.
        Well look at the votes on this suggestion they speak for themselves.
            you've literally gotten downvoted, the post is upvoted, and the mods added flairs for 76. what the absolute heck is your point?
                56 comments with 26 upvotes is not very good...


The fact that 6 of you are obsessed with the game and vote down everything that isn't positive for it is meaningless. 


Most people who don't like it didn't even open this thread.
Whats wrong with that?
    Memes and corporate greed, I think. However, it's nice to know that people enjoy it. It's a game. It's meant to be enjoyed. Even better if they finally polished it (which I think they did last year or so).

Based on what I've read since they've continually been working on undoing the no NPCs fiasco and making the game world more alive/interesting that the majority of still-existing negatives are related to the fact they're trying to duct tape together an older game engine that was never meant for a Fortnite clone to power their Fortnite clone causing extra issues. I read one of the biggest issues was how the engine had a reliance on framerate meaning if they have not fixed it yet two players interacting are each playing by different rules depending on the framerate on their local machines. Now without playing it I do not know how bad these issues actually are today vs negative press from its first release, but I do know the lovable FO4 runs like a bit of a lemon, and that was designed around the engine's intended use. I think a solo targeted rework of the game with their story expansions already built-in and other tweaks would be a relative success for a title that likely undersold as it might be more appealing to a considerable amount of past customers. They do of course have no incentive to do this as despite bragging rights for moving game copies I'm certain the adjustments to "downgrade" the engine are not easy and just as Rockstar all real profits probably come from micro-transactions like Brahmin Armor or something. 

As far as Ubisoft goes Blood Dragon is generally cheap and completely worth the asset flipping. The other two cases were marketed as new games (Primal, New Dawn) & did not look compelling, yet I've not tried either. I'd definitely call New Dawn a cash grab. Primal looked to have some original ideas, but it is kind of dirty to reuse that much of the map and present it as a new game really.
>  weapon health were all phenomenal advances in 76.

I disagree. Apart from my opinion on gear durability at large, they implemented gear durability in just about the laziest way possible. Net negative for the title imo.
    I suppose i can understand that. I just truly enkoyed the survivaly aspect of actually needing more of my junk because of durability. Also bulk junk and ammo crafting were really cool
        I would be less incensed if the mechanics were actually interesting, I.E Kingdom Come's grindstone mechanic. But there's really nothing interesting about it, it's just a little hampster wheel
            Thats true, I understand your stance for sure
Are you on PC? If not, it sounds like connection issues. I must be one of the only players who doesn’t experience these supposed graphical issues 🤷🏼‍♂️
    I was on Xbox x for the latest, and I have a fairly good connection 500mb down 50 up. 


I have around 20 hours in the game across several months of trying. I have played it on both my PC and Xbox, while the PC looks better it still just is not fun  to find a shotgun that is arbitrarily too high of a level for you. 

The game had so much potential but it just fell short in every imaginably way for me.
        To each their own
It's hated by a few who insist they are a majority.
    lol. you're funny. 😁
        yeah, i know, but with me it's intentional
    O really tell me about those sales figures...
        [deleted]
            lol...that's just the number of people who have played it....like ever. Including the ones who hated it. Considering the daily player count hasn't been able to break 10k consistently since it tanked after launch, I'd say it's doing about as well as it always has been.
                [deleted]
                    Nope, I mean unique. Every time Beth puts those numbers out that they hit some odd millions of players, they're including anyone who has ever played the game. It's just generally understood.

Also, I'm not sure where you're getting your numbers, but [other trackers](https://playercounter.com/fallout-76/) put it at half what you're reporting. Nevertheless, they numbers (whatever tracker you're using) have been stagnating since it tanked after launch (with short term spikes here and there when there's a giveaway, like what is happening right now). Once the XB/PS promo ends, the numbers will probably drop by around half or so like they always do.
                        [deleted]
            Number of an people who have played it. "Active players" is a number that you can create your own definition for. 

It isn't bad for a f2p game but only something like 2 million copies sold in the first 2 years.


I'm sure I'm 6 of those active players since played the demo on the PS4 and then played the free version on 2 different PC's  on steam and on gamepass.1
        The most successful game in the Fallout series, and at one point the most successful game in BGS history-- possibly still-- was 4. That doesn't stop haters. 76 was a sales disappointment, no doubt. But the game is still around, doing well, and still attracts new players. If sales figures measured love, NV would be hated in comparison to the love showered upon 4. Probably 76, too.
Maybe they got a feel for Appalachia as a whole, but I feel as though they missed the mark for WV specifically, which is a big deal seeing as how that’s where the game is set
    I'm in agreement with you.
What does that even mean?
    There's more to Fallout than just FO76.
But it’s the bad players who bring out the bad element to start with.

Maybe we should start ‘naughty stepping’ 🤷‍♂️🤷?
So don’t play it. Or more to the point, don’t complain to fans about it. 😊
    And you can just go over to r/fo76 if you want to talk about it. 

I would prefer if this sub stayed focused on the real games.
        I see what you mean, but this Sub is a general Fallout sub, not specific.
            Regardless it is what it is. 

I won't go on 76 and complain about it. But this sub is not dedicated to 76.
                No, it’s dedicated to FALLOUT in general. Not to be rude but this mystery seems to pass you by dear.
                    Ok it's dedicated to fallout with a story and lore. Not a story lacking MMOs.
                        Let’s just say our good nights (I’m in England) and happy gaming. 😊
                        76 base game has a story and is choked to the gills with lore before you even add in the updates.
                Please from now on refrain from talking about New Vegas on this subreddit because it has it's own subreddit and should only be discussed there. Thank you in advance.
                    Except people like new Vegas
                        Are you really this selfish that you think anyone with a different opinion than you should just not talk about what they like or prefer to play? Seems pretty lonely to me, i pity you.
                They aren't asking it to be dedicated to 76 though just that there be an option for those that want 76 flairs and such.
                    Well look at how few upvotes the post got...


That should answer your questions.
                        It doesn't because I didn't have one nor does it mean the sub shouldn't have 76 tags. And now the mods have added them in so looks like it's been decided.
                        So by your own measures 76 is now a good game, since the post has around 130 upvotes and about 90 comments
                        Dude look at your dislikes no one agrees with you 😭🤣 talking about "this got no votes" yet you hating on 76 got you -16 on 1 comment alone.
                        Almost everything ive seen you post on this sub about your opinion is in the negatives so maybe you shouldn't be here if you wanna use that logic
76 is fallout. especially moreso than 2 or new vegas.
    >especially moreso than 2 or new vegas

Please tell me you're baiting.
        No.
            Care to explain why? Do you sincerely believe Fallout is supposed to be a MMO looter shooter with very limited RPG influences instead of a narrative-based RPG?
                >Do you sincerely believe Fallout is supposed to be a MMO looter shooter with very limited RPG influences instead of a narrative-based RPG?

76 is literally none of that. It's not an mmo, it's just online. It isn't a looter shooter (play borderlands if you want to see what a looter shooter is). And it has a lot of rpg mechanics and influences and is for the most part narrative based for as much as it can be as an online game.

You do know fallout fans have wanted an online game since the early 2000s, right? Even going so far to use fallout 1 and 2 (2's more popular) as a base for an online mmo game? The original creators ("original", i'm pretty sure it was the fallout 2 dev team) also working on an official fallout mmo at the time in 2005?

Fallout isn't defined by its single player aspects. You can dislike online games. I, myself, do. But that doesn't make it not fallout.
                    You still didn't explain what makes 76 "more Fallout" than New Vegas and 2.
                        76 is consistent with the lore (2 and new vegas aren't). 76 goes hard on the ideals of the franchise (due to its online nature of constant updates and its expansive, massive open world; and 2 and new vegas seem to not really grasp fully fallout's ideals, new vegas moreso than 2).
        I mean if we’re being honest. Fallout 3 is pretty close to Fallout 1 in setting and theme, Fallout 76 isn’t far behind either due to how it shows how fucked up the world got after being nuked. Fallout 2, New Vegas and 4 are just satires of a nuclear apocalypse. A small section of the fanbase think 1 and 3 are the true Fallout games.
            1 and 3 are also satire.

2 and new vegas just get lore wrong and don't quite fully understand what it is fallout satirizes and critiques.
                Fallout 2 and New Vegas is more on the nose with satire is what I mean, it’s obvious it wants it’s satire to be known. Fallout 1 and 3 are more subtle imo.
                    Eh. I guess. At least with 2. They're just not good satires.
            What seems more like a satire of the setting is that in Fallout 3, more than 200 years after the bombs fell, people are still essentially living in the mud, scavenging old ruins for food and medicine instead of developing or re-discovering ways of creating both, and seemingly incapable of (or unwilling to) rebuild society. What makes 2 and New Vegas so great is that they show the perseverance of humanity, and yet also how fragile society is.
                Eh, I think Slavers, Super Mutants, Raiders, and also being the Nation’s capital getting nuked to hell would be the reason why people in DC are scraping to get by. Even good Mercs are being taken down(Reily’s Rangers). Rivet City and Tenpenny Tower are the closest to actually trying to rebuild civilization. Other settlements are just living in the moment. Doesn’t explain where food comes from in Fallout 3 though since there’s no farms mentioned in any of the towns.
    Well look at the votes on this suggestion they speak for themselves.
        you've literally gotten downvoted, the post is upvoted, and the mods added flairs for 76. what the absolute heck is your point?
            56 comments with 26 upvotes is not very good...


The fact that 6 of you are obsessed with the game and vote down everything that isn't positive for it is meaningless. 


Most people who don't like it didn't even open this thread.
Memes and corporate greed, I think. However, it's nice to know that people enjoy it. It's a game. It's meant to be enjoyed. Even better if they finally polished it (which I think they did last year or so).
You were prepared to say the joke, you must be prepared to take the consequences of it
Schrodinger’s douchebag moment
I'm currently playing New Vegas for the first time and I feel this a lot. I'm essentially only exploring wherever they tell me to. I don't know if it gets more open in the mid game but to be honest I'm not enjoying myself as much as I thought I would be
    It doesn't, really. NV isn't really about exploration. It's a curated experience meant to tell a story, and the main quest will take you through or near every relevant place on the map. There's little to see by going elsewhere

Don't let people here fool you into thinking that NV is flawless. It's great for the extra role-playing and writing closer to the original Fallout's, but if you prefer world building and exploration, NV sadly has very little of it
        I see. I guess it's better to set my expectations correctly then. Thanks for the heads up!
Try fallout 76 if you love exploration!!!!
Everyone I listen to is on YouTube, I listen to longer stories from RadKing, Synonymous, and Oxhorn. I’m also a fan of N_orte and TKs-Mantis

If you’re into short skits I recommend checking out I Am Naiwal, smaller creator that’s getting more popular, pretty funny dude
    Thanks for the info.
    Yo Oxhorn is cool, I like his vids
Fucked how? It doesn't affect the base game in any permanent way, you can just turn them off with no problems for the game.
    Fucked because you don't enjoy the vanilla game because youve been playing with mods too much. At least for me that's how it is.
This is the 5% that ruins my want for the game. Having other real players around isn't a big issue, but the compromises the design forced are. It is logical that they would not want me to take a quest away from other players by killing a quest-giver, but they've also taken away my choice to kill that quest-giver. Kind of sacrilege, but I wish they went the GTA 5 path where a well-crafted solo game with a coherent (interesting at least) story is sold and the same map is opened for multiplayer like a month later with its own less long-term stories & such. Like I just can't accept that if I found the Republic of Dave but it was in 76 it sounds like I wouldn't be able to kill anyone or tamper with an election, or lure a deathclaw into the town or cause any long-term changes as they need all choices to be available for all players on the server at all times meaning they've accidentally given all of us basically no choices. Now I just sigh and wait for some saint to recreate the entire 76 map and story from scratch in a FO4 mod because modders are always doing crazy, generous shit.
I suppose i can understand that. I just truly enkoyed the survivaly aspect of actually needing more of my junk because of durability. Also bulk junk and ammo crafting were really cool

You do know fallout fans have wanted an online game since the early 2000s, right? Even going so far to use fallout 1 and 2 (2's more popular) as a base for an online mmo game? The original creators ("original", i'm pretty sure it was the fallout 2 dev team) also working on an official fallout mmo at the time in 2005?

Fallout isn't defined by its single player aspects. You can dislike online games. I, myself, do. But that doesn't make it not fallout.
            You still didn't explain what makes 76 "more Fallout" than New Vegas and 2.
                76 is consistent with the lore (2 and new vegas aren't). 76 goes hard on the ideals of the franchise (due to its online nature of constant updates and its expansive, massive open world; and 2 and new vegas seem to not really grasp fully fallout's ideals, new vegas moreso than 2).
I mean if we’re being honest. Fallout 3 is pretty close to Fallout 1 in setting and theme, Fallout 76 isn’t far behind either due to how it shows how fucked up the world got after being nuked. Fallout 2, New Vegas and 4 are just satires of a nuclear apocalypse. A small section of the fanbase think 1 and 3 are the true Fallout games.
    1 and 3 are also satire.

2 and new vegas just get lore wrong and don't quite fully understand what it is fallout satirizes and critiques.
        Fallout 2 and New Vegas is more on the nose with satire is what I mean, it’s obvious it wants it’s satire to be known. Fallout 1 and 3 are more subtle imo.
            Eh. I guess. At least with 2. They're just not good satires.
    What seems more like a satire of the setting is that in Fallout 3, more than 200 years after the bombs fell, people are still essentially living in the mud, scavenging old ruins for food and medicine instead of developing or re-discovering ways of creating both, and seemingly incapable of (or unwilling to) rebuild society. What makes 2 and New Vegas so great is that they show the perseverance of humanity, and yet also how fragile society is.
        Eh, I think Slavers, Super Mutants, Raiders, and also being the Nation’s capital getting nuked to hell would be the reason why people in DC are scraping to get by. Even good Mercs are being taken down(Reily’s Rangers). Rivet City and Tenpenny Tower are the closest to actually trying to rebuild civilization. Other settlements are just living in the moment. Doesn’t explain where food comes from in Fallout 3 though since there’s no farms mentioned in any of the towns.
you've literally gotten downvoted, the post is upvoted, and the mods added flairs for 76. what the absolute heck is your point?
    56 comments with 26 upvotes is not very good...


The fact that 6 of you are obsessed with the game and vote down everything that isn't positive for it is meaningless. 


Most people who don't like it didn't even open this thread.
I see. I guess it's better to set my expectations correctly then. Thanks for the heads up!
Thats true, I understand your stance for sure
lol...that's just the number of people who have played it....like ever. Including the ones who hated it. Considering the daily player count hasn't been able to break 10k consistently since it tanked after launch, I'd say it's doing about as well as it always has been.

        Nope, I mean unique. Every time Beth puts those numbers out that they hit some odd millions of players, they're including anyone who has ever played the game. It's just generally understood.

Also, I'm not sure where you're getting your numbers, but [other trackers](https://playercounter.com/fallout-76/) put it at half what you're reporting. Nevertheless, they numbers (whatever tracker you're using) have been stagnating since it tanked after launch (with short term spikes here and there when there's a giveaway, like what is happening right now). Once the XB/PS promo ends, the numbers will probably drop by around half or so like they always do.

Number of an people who have played it. "Active players" is a number that you can create your own definition for. 

It isn't bad for a f2p game but only something like 2 million copies sold in the first 2 years.


I'm sure I'm 6 of those active players since played the demo on the PS4 and then played the free version on 2 different PC's  on steam and on gamepass.1
Regardless it is what it is. 

I won't go on 76 and complain about it. But this sub is not dedicated to 76.
    No, it’s dedicated to FALLOUT in general. Not to be rude but this mystery seems to pass you by dear.
        Ok it's dedicated to fallout with a story and lore. Not a story lacking MMOs.
            Let’s just say our good nights (I’m in England) and happy gaming. 😊
            76 base game has a story and is choked to the gills with lore before you even add in the updates.
    Please from now on refrain from talking about New Vegas on this subreddit because it has it's own subreddit and should only be discussed there. Thank you in advance.
        Except people like new Vegas
            Are you really this selfish that you think anyone with a different opinion than you should just not talk about what they like or prefer to play? Seems pretty lonely to me, i pity you.
    They aren't asking it to be dedicated to 76 though just that there be an option for those that want 76 flairs and such.
        Well look at how few upvotes the post got...


That should answer your questions.
            It doesn't because I didn't have one nor does it mean the sub shouldn't have 76 tags. And now the mods have added them in so looks like it's been decided.
            So by your own measures 76 is now a good game, since the post has around 130 upvotes and about 90 comments
            Dude look at your dislikes no one agrees with you 😭🤣 talking about "this got no votes" yet you hating on 76 got you -16 on 1 comment alone.
            Almost everything ive seen you post on this sub about your opinion is in the negatives so maybe you shouldn't be here if you wanna use that logic
Care to explain why? Do you sincerely believe Fallout is supposed to be a MMO looter shooter with very limited RPG influences instead of a narrative-based RPG?
