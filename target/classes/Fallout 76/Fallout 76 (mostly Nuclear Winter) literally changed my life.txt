[[Fallout 76 (mostly Nuclear Winter) literally changed my life]]


It sounds a bit hyperbolic but it‚Äôs actually true. I started playing Fallout 76 during BETA. Didn‚Äôt have a lot going on but met a girl who showed me where to find an alien blaster and a couple other things. 

We became good friends over the course of a couple years but neither of us thought the other one was interested romantically. Then Nuclear Winter dropped and we played for hours a day together. 

She told me about emotional things that happened in her life, and she was on the mic with me when my dog died. It wasn‚Äôt until I was talking about one of my character being a redhead that she told me she was a redhead. I didn‚Äôt believe her because her profile picture always showed her as a brunette, but she dyed it because she used to get made fun of in school.

2020 rolls around and we became close and started a long distance relationship. We would have private Fallout gaming sessions and sync up a movie every Saturday. 

Eventually we met in person. She drove 13 hours to come meet me. She brought her Xbox of course and we played Fallout in the same room üòÇ. Except now we got to hang out after the gaming was done.

Today, I finished packing my stuff. I‚Äôm moving several states away to be with an amazing woman who has as much passion for gaming as I do, and we have our own setups which means we won‚Äôt be fighting over the console lol.

Not only that, but because of the move I ended up landing a position at Space X cooking for all the engineers and literal rocket scientists. Also got a new car.

If it wasn‚Äôt for this game I would never met this amazing woman, never would have gotten this job, and I wouldn‚Äôt be about to move and start a whole new life. People can poop on the Nuclear Winter game mode and Fallout 76, but it brought two people together, not to mention people are scared of us in the lobbies because we have amazing teamwork.

Just wanted to say thank you to Bethesda for being the unwitting match maker, and hope to see y‚Äôall in the wasteland!

[EDIT: since there are some people that want proof I uploaded a video originally intended to only go to my GF explaining what all I‚Äôm bring this trip and what to come back for on the next trip. If you still don‚Äôt believe me her Reddit username is Imathiccaroni and she‚Äôs commented on my thread. I understand skepticism, but it‚Äôs happening. And super thankful for all the good wishes, never thought it would even break 100 upvotes I was frankly shocked when I woke up! Anyways have a nice day.)

Wow, that's a very sweet story and I'm glad you shared it. It just goes to show while people sometimes poke fun at video games for being isolating, they really can bring people together from time to time. I know we can all probably think of at least one worthwhile person we met in a game, and while 76 got a lot of criticism for being multiplayer that style of game can be great too when you meet the right people. Hope you have good luck with the move and everything else.
    I'm a huge Destiny 2 fan and this is the one reason I play. Im a very social person but sometimes, I can be wiped from school and football practice. Getting home and just hopping on with my buddies can be really relaxing and just fun. Its nice to be able to hang out with people without putting all my energy into it.

Edit: but seriously congrats that‚Äôs awesome I wish y‚Äôall the best and see ya in the wasteland!
    Except X6-88, who seems to have blown a circuit.
‚ÄúIn a world filled with hardship and misery, it is comforting to know that in the end, there is a light in the darkness.‚Äù -Joshua Graham.

And I believe that you good Sir have found yourself a light in the darkness. Even if I can never enjoy Fallout 76, I am glad to hear that you and your significant other both enjoy it. I wish you the best of luck moving forwards in your lives.
    If they go on to get married I think it's fairly certain there needs to be a fallout theme in there somewhere

Damn people seem really triggered over this just because happened over 76. I don‚Äôt why so many have a stick jammed up their arse over a game that a decent amount enjoy and make memories from.
    The game is really irrelevant to the experience. I met my wife on a MUD, which is an MMO (except purely text). How you meet someone is irrelevant. It's what happens after you meet them that matters.
    Because entirely too many people think that disliking something makes them interesting and discriminating.
I demand the gamer couple tax.
Now that I am no longer driving, and can focus on a reply- I want to say firstly I cried. I would have never known when this game mode first came out, that my best friend would be moving in as my partner years later. What an amazing friendship we have, and now having the opportunity to grow and make a life with you, is one of the most beautiful accomplishments in my life. I get to be in a relationship, with my best friend! Now, we enter a new chapter, and get to see each other DAILY rather than every few months! I cant wait to annoy you, and thank you for tolerating me these past few months. üòâ

For those who are curious or have doubt, this is definitely real! My GT is [MajorNomz]. ü§ó
Nice story love finds a Way always
I love these stories! This is so awesome. I had a life-changing experience around Fallout 4, too, and any amount of bashing people do to that game doesn‚Äôt change my experience. It won‚Äôt yours, either, so don‚Äôt listen to the haters! Thank you for sharing, and I truly wish you both all the best.

Man this is the most wholesome shit I have ever read.
Fallout 76 has one of the best online communities out there. Great story friend
You played fallout while your dog died?
    I think it was more so they were close enough they talked in addition to FO, or it happened suddenly
Todd Howard is that you
Are you sure you aren‚Äôt just wasting your life on video games though? /s obviously

That‚Äôs a great story! Especially the part about you each having your own console. I have 6 y/o triplets that I got into gaming and now I don‚Äôt get to play much anymore lol 

Bonus - 2 of the 3 are redheads!
I literally shared this with everyone I know, amazing story man! If I had an award to give I would
At least one thing F76 did well. Good on you mate
Yeah, it really sounds like a typical reddit story created only to farm karma. Really, it has everything a stereotypical redditor yearns but can't possibly achieve.


A redhead gamer girlfriend? Check


Working at Space X? Check.
    Hello! I am the girlfriend, and it is definitely real!
    [Feel free to check my GT on social media. MajorNomz formally known as themajornomnomz! Were definitely known within the community because of our relationship. ‚ô•Ô∏è
    I've learned to just assume it's all real but dont take any advice from it, uplifting story but I'll move on mostly unchanged, although a bit more pep in my step
IT amazes all the time how a minute of time will change a person's life.
Not that my low karma acct here means much, but I've run a few rounds of Nuclear Winter with both of them over the past year under my many Xbox aliases. True story, awesome people and I wish them the best. There is so much toxicity within the Xbox Nuclear Winter community so it's awesome to see something good for a change. See you both online after the move and hopefully for a few charity streams soon.
    Yes! Let's link up once we're back! We are coming back a day earlier than anticipated, so Sunday is open!
Shit dude, you hit the jackpot on life for a while. Congrats
How cool would it be if bethesda put them in a random house in wasteland as skeletons playing video games next to each other in the next fallout. What a beautiful story.
Nice try, Bethesda XD

You know, I give Fallout 76 a lot of flack, but I think just from this its existance is a net-positive in the universe. Happy for you both <3
I'm really happy for both of you!
This is really cool man, what a great story!
Guys, while it's definitely speculation that is is some Bethesda written love story brought to Reddit in hopes it would become some in game DLC or something, I can assure you their relationship is real.

Nomz and I are super close. I met Nomz through a Facebook post forever ago when someone was trying to assemble an "all girl squad" for Nuclear Winter.

We've spoken almost every day since then, about in game and real life things as well. We've even sent mail back and forth. 

It's not hard to believe relationships can come from a game and exist in real life. I remember when I messaged her making a guess towards a relationship and I've lit up like a Christmas tree at every single progression they've made over the time they've been together.

I'm excited for you both and Tag, good luck on the move AND the new job. You guys are the best. üíïüíï

Just take care of her for me. üíï
Now this is how a relationship is meant to work. Best friends above all else.

So beautiful, I hope you two have many, many more years of fun together.
    Absolutely. He is my best friend.
Luckyüòä
Ah, the old ____ game cured my fucking cancer.
    Do you need a hug or something?
Hot damn, good for you my guy! I wish you the best!
Love.....love never changes
Nice. I hope you will work out just well
Glad to hear that something positive came out of 76.
So all it needs is a total atomic annalitation? Sign me in.
Congrats mate, and happy trails!
Speechless man. I wish you much luck, mate!
Hope the move goes smoothly!
Sounds like my dream
I‚Äôve only just gotten into Fallout 76 and as a massive Fallout fan, I‚Äôm actually pleasantly surprised! I‚Äôm really enjoying the game and am planning to play it for a long while. Good luck with everything mate!
Where can we get the alien blaster though?
Edit: I thought it was about finding it in NW, not adventure mode.
    It is in a toxic pond in a crate. If you are on Xbox I can help you get it.
wow. See mom, video games are good for you!
Post pics or it didn't happen
    These types of posts have become so popular on this sub. It's almost as if it's a method to farm free karma?...
        Ngl, I'm naturally skeptical of stories like this.

Its almost like one of my Japanese animes
            Stinks that people use it for free karma, but it‚Äôs legit, I‚Äôm not unaware of how rare an Xbox relationship is, but I‚Äôm leaving in two days. Imthiccaroni is her username she posted in this thread herself.

That's awesome! Congrautulations!
L M A Ooooooooo
I'm glad something good came from Fallout 76.
10 years ago, I would‚Äôve been immature and said something about nerds and losers falling in love over video games
Today as a much more mature, married man, this is pretty awesome and a perfect reminder that love can be found anywhere. Congrats to you!
Nice story hope you have funnn
Daaaamn! This is awesome!
Keep working at the relationship and you‚Äôll have years of happiness ahead!
That‚Äôs so awesome! Hope it all works out for you guys:)

Nice story! *two people!

Congrats!!
Awwww what an amazing story ‚ù§
Ahhh don‚Äôt make me look like a soon! I love this story! This is what makes my heart feel warm and happy! Enjoy your lives together!
"It just works" - Todd Howard on your relationship.  Love seeing these games bring people together.
Such a great fucking story. Happy for the both of you!
I don't buy it Todd, I know your ways! 

And now seriously, I'm really happy for the two of you, it's a very sweet story.
i am happy for you sir. have a wonderful relationship
[NaveTheFirst upvoted that.]
Beautiful story and congratulations on your recent success. You guys are now ~~obligated~~ able to celebrate *halloween as Wastelanders*. Just an idea I've had for awhile

EDIT: Obviously not obligated.
I don't believe this story for a second.

I got a similar story but with Elder Scrolls Online :)
Happy for you brotato!
Who knew the shittiest things could bring people together, well atleast you had a better experience with 76 than i did
    Maybe if you could get that stick looked at you could enjoy it?

Props to you dude. 

Some people turn lemons into lemonade

You turned a steaming pile of shit into a feel-good story
Um....WOW.
For such a broken, collapsing game with no foundation.. it actually did some good.
Your whole life got flipped around for the better because Bethesda didn't use a condom.
Congrats man
    I don't like 76 either but give it a rest

            The joke stopped being funny after the 4374893th time.

How desperate Bethesda is to has to come up with stories like these to sell their games lol
    Neither of them work for Bethesda. I've played a few rounds of NW with them both over the past year or so under my many aliases. True story. I wish them the best. Good to see something good come out of the dumpster fire that is Nuclear Winter.
What a chad
You're probably the only one that got something good out of FO76.
    He‚Äôs not.
Speak for yourself bro all that game did was give me a foot contusion
Dude. You hold onto that woman she's your fucking lobster!
YEET
Long distance relationship.... GL I guess

Zax approves
So honest question, did you guys totally make out that first time you met in person? Like was there instant physical chemistry, did you meet and want to kiss her, then regret not kissing her, or did you have to meet each other a few times before you started having romantic feelings/started acting on them? I can imagine it going any which way!
Really cool! üòÅ
You guys deserve the best!
So many people wish to be in your exact shoes. Good shit man happy for you!

Can't believe it was 76 that changed your life but the way I see it, there was no other option!
Congrats bro! I'm glad life is smiling on you! :D
Congrats! :)
Wow, I‚Äôm lost for words
damn, im happy for ya
Congrats!

Best of luck to you both! I hope you have a wonderful future together.
