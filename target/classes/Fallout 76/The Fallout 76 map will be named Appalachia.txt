[[The Fallout 76 map will be named Appalachia]]


[Twitter Post](https://mobile.twitter.com/Fallout/status/1042881085158318080?s=09)

Fallout 3 was the Capital Wasteland


Fallout New Vegas was the Mojave Wasteland


Fallout 4 was the Commonwealth


Fallout 76 is Appalachia


Will there still be Country Roads in Appalachia?
    Only one. Itll take you home tho.

            I haven't watched the trailer in like... 4 weeks... thiis made me watch again.  Joy.
    I really hope they have the John Denver version in the game.
        Probably since the family is pimping him out since his death
    I like country roads as much as the next guy, but have you heard BIGGGGG IRRRRRRON!!!

So, why isn't anybody talking about how we have a guitar sword now?
    Ikr. What an incredible weapon. Yet another thing to conflict me on purchasing this game.
        It’s cool looking for sure but you couldn’t play it right? Wouldn’t you have to be able to fret it?
            Correct. It could only be played “open” or in other words the only notes that could be played are whatever the strings are tuned to. If you did something like a pentatonic scale though that gives you some decent room to work with. 
                You could play it with a slide. With slide guitar you press the slide against the strings just hard enough to change the note. You’d probably have to play by ear cause it lacks the markings. 
                    You would definitely have to play by ear, and without something behind the slide to press against I'm still not convinced you'd be able to get a good sound, but I've never tried to play slide on a guitar without a fretboard so I really wouldn't know. I could be surprised at how well the slide alone is able to prevent vibration up the string and therefor result in a higher pitch. 

I've played guitar for many many years now, and completely rebuilt my strat squire with all new electronics to make a sort of franken-strat. Really want to buy a kit to build a telecaster. 
                        I play cigar box guitars, on my current slide guitar there’s a 1/4 inch of space between the strings and the neck. Pressing the strings hard enough to get to the board would be uncomfortable and sound terrible. With a slide guitar it’s more like you’re bringing the fret down on the string than bringing the strings down to the fret. 
                            Yeah I get the concept, I just didn't know if that would be enough to make a "seal" so to speak, but based ont he way you described it it makes a lot of sense. I actually really appreciate the simile you used. 
                                I didn't even think it was as complicated as that- when the slide touches the strings it becomes the fret. You slide around with the strings not even touching the fretboard or frets. You could have a foot of space away from the board and still play. Take this guitar sword and grab one of the many glass bottles around and you got the blues. I doubt it because, well, it's a Bethesda (aka Missed Opportunities Inc.) game but having like a bard class that plays music at settlements would be rad as fuck and is exactly why it probably won't happen.

J/K Bethesda love you guys thx 4 da memories
                        Lap steel guitars are essentially fretless because the strings are raised so far up. So assume it would be a little like that. 
                        you don't press down to the board with a slide, the slide acts as the fret
                        You dont press against anything with a slide, the slide itself acts as the fret. It would totally work. Whether it would sound good eith a guitar like that is another matter
                They could do what Rust did, where the guitar plays a different note depending how high or low you aim the crosshairs
            I enjoy your pun
        I mean people are gonna port all these weapons to fo4 so won't have too still!
            [deleted]
                Literally just extract model file then port it to fo4 it's the same engine and I beet that did not change model structure and it also seems they are not making many new animations. All you would have to do is post to lovers lab and not Nexus/bnet. 
            No, people won't, because it'll get shut down in a heart beat.

E: Imagine down voting someone because you don't like being reminded that intellectual property laws exist. 
                [removed]
                    If people try to port stuff from F76 to FO4 then Nexus and Bethesda will shut it down. It's happened before with people trying to port FO3 content to FNV
                        [removed]
                            They'll still receive a cease and desist and legal action if it continues. 
                                *cough*a tale of two wastelands*cough*
                                    *cough* that's only allowed because it requires you to own a legal copy of both FO3 and FNV and won't allow you to illegally obtain access to asset you haven't bought the rights to access by owning both games *cough*
                                [removed]
                                    Imagine pirating a fucking shitty weapon model. Fuck me kid, just take the L that people won't put the effort into porting this shit
                        People ported the LAER from FNV to Fo4 and it's still there.
                            That wasn't a port. That was a mod, with its own original model and textures. People can mod the new F76 weapons into FO4 all they like, but they can't take the models or the textures and just port them in. 
                                This is just coming down to a battle of what terms are used. The bottom line is that LAER existed in FNV and someone made it for Fo4. Is it a "port" of something from FNV? Technically, no. Is it something from FNV that now exists in Fo4? Yes, and continually does so.
                                    No, it comes down to, people won't be able to port the models and textures from F76 into FO4 because they legally can't do it. They can recreate something similar and mod it in but they can't port it. Making my initial statement correct. 
                They don't care if you port from 1 Bethesda game to another. They might now but I doubt they would get rid of mod support for 76 then also ban using any assets from it. We can see this by looking at atale of two wastelands mod that literally ports all of fallout 3 to 4.
                    They do care. Because legally they have to care, if they allow one modder to redistribute their assets freely then they lose precedence to go after other people who do the same. TTW doesn't allow people to play Fallout 3 or use an of its asset for free. It requires people to own the full FO3 GOTY and the full FNV Ultimate edition. It's not redistributing assets or content for free to people who don't own the license to access that content.

I can prove to you they do care because they won't allow to Fallout 4 Capital Wasteland mod to use the FO3 audio assets. 
                        Audio is a bigger deal due to voice actor contracts but heres how to get around it. Do the exact same thing they did and make a installer that extracts and adds to fo4.
                            It's not a bigger deal, it's the exact same deal, it's about intellectual property and licensing and all that shit. And if someone wanted to go through that effort that'd be fine. But it still doesn't dispute my point that people won't just be "porting it to FO4" 
                                im even you really could jsut not upload it to nexus and bnet. bethesda is not gonna go threw 10000 hoops to take down a mod off some random site that gets few thousand visitors a day at most.
                                    If they know about it they will, because they have to legally to have any precedent against other cases. You make one exception then other companies and people start to do the same and you have no foot to stand on in court. 
        When was that shown?
        I don't see why you would be conflicted. Wait for the reviews. If it looks like something you would enjoy playing, buy it. If it doesn't look like something you would enjoy playing, don't buy it.
    Now I can kill my enemies, to the sweet sounds of country roads, take me home
        I hope to be a bard. 
    ITS A FOOKIN BANJO
    You mean other than the people talking about it?
    New character concept for me then, Johnny Guitar.
    I’m always looking for melee weapons in this series. Swords especially. American Samurai build for the win!
    *banjo
    Well I Mean you can play music AND bash skulls... What do you want more?


    Now you can roleplay as Quick Draw McGraw/El Kabong.
    Well,now I have to spec bard. 
    Sold!
They had the chance to name it Waste Virginia and they didn't go for it :(
    Well I stopped caring about naming conventions when I found a minefield called Minefield.
        How about the scrapyard named Scrapyard
            Or a vault called “Vault” then a number designating it
        [deleted]
            As long as you find the Overseers Kampf.
    you could say... they wasted the chance
        Haha because it's a wasteland haha 
            Get out. 




And join me in my room of punstoppable outcasts
    That’s normal West Virginia though
    Mmmm that is a tasty pun.
You’re telling me it’s not called West Virginia... I want my refund 
    Maybe they're calling it Appalachia in case they want to expand the map outside of West Virginia in the future.
        Shit we haven't even mentioned this yet. Where the DLC gonna be, boys? 
            They *could* expand to actual quests at some point and involve the Enclave. But that's me, being wishful. 
                I guess the enclave would be neat, but what business would they have in some midwest shithole shortly after the bombs dropped?
                    Greenbrier bunker? 
                        Hmm fair point, not sure if it'd be relevant enough of a place but it'd be a valid enough excuse
                    And West Virginia isn't in the Midwest. Part of the state is within a couple hours (depending on traffic) of Washington DC. It borders Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and regular Virginia, none of which are Midwestern states either.
&nbsp;

I don't want to sound like I'm coming down too hard on you here . Geography can be hard for some people to remember, even if they live nearby. I spent years thinking that Savannah and Augusta (Georgia) were in basically the same place. 
                    Midwest?
                        Sory am from punjab pakistan forgive for not knw geography 🙏
                            It’s okay!! West Virginia is very East ironically the only thing separating it from the East Coast is Virginia and Pennsylvania if I remember correctly 
            They said no DLC just updates, that is no must purchase DLCs like in the other games
            It's gonna be a VR thing like Operation Anchorage. You find an old high-tech entertainment arcade and do some quests to get it running. Then you climb into the VR pod and everything goes dark. You hear wood creaking and the sound of horses, and your vision fades in to to the sight of snowy rocks and pine trees. You hear a voice: "Hey, you, you’re finally awake. You were trying to cross the border right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush same as us and that thief over there."
                TOOOOOOOOODD
            Cincinnati/Ohio My Boy!(Hopefully). Old Cincinnati is sweet. Used to be a much bigger city with a steampunk type feel.

        It was a joke ;)
    I mean it’s still West Virginia. It just has a funny name.
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachia
    A-ppa-la-chiaaaaaaaaa 
        As someone who has lived in the region, I feel obligated to point out that it's pronounced
&nbsp;

**App-uh-lach-uh**, not App-uh-lay-chuh. 
Unless there's rampant amounts of empty prescription painkiller bottles, meth labs and needles it won't be realistic enough.

Show us the true Appalachia, Bethesda.
    What? The copious amounts of chems already featured in every Fallout isn't enough for you?
        We just need empty syringes of Med-X and bottles of Mentats fucking everywhere, like empty alcohol bottles 
            A few Daddy-O syringes sprinkled in there as well. I want that chem to make a come back!
        There's enough drugs and paraphernalia floating around Appalachia (eastern KY and WV specifically) to make FO3, FO:NV and FO4 look drug free.
    Man if they'd have a run at the Seattle area...we have a town nicknamed Tweakerville for a reason.
        If Bethesda ever goes West coast again, the Portland-Seattle area would be great. Wouldn't look too different in some areas, though.
            The area by union station (amtrack station in downtown Portland) straight looked like it was out of fallout this summer with the forts and homes these homeless people were building 
                That's always Seattle. 
Ballard is bad too

                    It’s so bad in Seattle too, I was up for a wknd like 3 weeks ago and was staying in an air bnb right next to Chinatown. Super pretty city but I walked around one morning at 7am and it allowed me to see how bad the homeless situation was (I even got grabbed from behind by a dude ) 
            More than west coast again, I just wish they make the next game set near the Great Lakes. I wonder how Detroit turned out. (I don’t like the Seattle/Oregon idea, I just wanna see how detroit turned out)

And I wonder how Bethesda will treat fallout Miami in terms of lore. If they don’t acknowledge it, they better make a game of their own set around Florida and southeast. 

And I wonder if we can get a game set in Canada. Apparently the US annexed Canada in the FO universe and I’m curious how Canadian east and west coast turned out. 
                I've always thought a Fallout game in Canada would be perfect. There could be a ton of pre-war "You're an American now, act like it!" Propaganda stuff everywhere. Would be very very cool. And probably rather cold.
            We're getting a very promising looking mod set in that area called Fallout Cascadia.
        Yeah, Chinatown would give fallout a run for its money 
        You mean Olympia..
    I recall hearing something about a pharmaceutical manufacturing facility being in-game at some point, so some of it will surely be there.

        West Virginia
            
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River


Life is old there, older than the trees


Younger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze


Country roads, take me home

To the place I belong


West Virginia, mountain mama


Take me home, country roads


All my memories gather round her


Miner's lady, stranger to blue water


Dark and dusty, painted on the sky


Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye


Country roads, take me home


To the place I belong


West Virginia, mountain mama


Take me home, country roads


I hear her voice, in the morning hour she calls me


The radio reminds me of my home far away


And driving down the road I get a feeling


That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday


Country roads, take me home


To the place I belong


West Virginia, mountain mama


Take me home, country roads


Country roads, take me home


To the place I belong


West Virginia, mountain mama


Take me home, country roads


Take me home, down country roads


Take me home, down country roads



Fuck lyric threads
                r/threadkillers
                Ikr? Thanks for killing it. We need more like this.
I think it's very important here that we determine if it will be called "apple-AH-cha" or  "apple-AY-cha"
    If you mispronounce my region of origin I'll throw an apple atcha
        This is actually super helpful to remember how to pronounce it, thank you.
        Have a virtual, second upvote. I came here to say the same. I live in this mountain range and people cringe when you pronounce it wrong.
        It's not app a la pa chia?
            That's a planet full of weird sedative robots. 
                Idontgetit.exe
                    Oh! I thought you were making a reference to an [episode](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Girl_Who_Waited?wprov=sfla1) of Doctor Who. It takes place on a planet whose name sounds like someone reading the word "Appalachia" out loud for the first time. 
    App uh latch in is how it's pronounced and I expect nothing but accuracy from Bethesda. Otherwise alot of us fallout fans in the mountains are going to be pissed 
        Imagine how upset people in Boston were when the DLC wasn't Fah Hahbah.
            Proud Mainer here, very disappointed it wasn't Fah Hahbah and that there wasn't a line I heard referring to mirelurk hunters as "them lobstahs"
                "yeah theyah vawlt dwellah, we been gettin hit by these fahkin yuge lobstahs, and i don't think theyall go inna soup, if you know what im sayin" 
                    I don't, sorry.
                        Well a humph and a discontented grumble to you too cranky
                            Haha. Wasn't trying to be cranky, I was on board until the second comma then I didn't understand what they were getting at. 
                                I just read the comment and now I'm confused at what that last sentence that dude said was about too... 
                                    See! I'm not an ass, just a confused non-New Englander.
            Hehehhehehe
        Uh, the most disappointing thing in FO3 was when the protectron guarding the declaration of independence introduced himself as Button Gwinn-it. It's pronounced Gwi-net.

Button Gwinnett was a founding father and repsentative of Georgia who signed the declaration. I grew up in the county next to the one named after him. 
            Actually if he was from geoegia his accent might be to blame for him saying Gwin it
        As someone who lives in the foothills of those mountains, APPA LAY CHA.
            Us civilized folks in Western NC say Ap uh latch uh, because we're not savages. 
                East Tennessee here and that’s exactly right.
                    Going to Gatlinburg for New Years! If I hear AppaLAYchan while I'm there, 2019 will be ruined. 
                        Don't worry most in Gatlinburg say it correctly the damn tourist on the other hands not so much. SWVA here. They better say some of the town names correctly if they are featured as well
                This is the only correct way right here^^^
            Me too. Although the last syllable is sometimes pronounced more like "sha" than "cha".
            Yes, definitely this one.
            Traitor
    WVian, I’ve travelled all around the state. In my honest opinion I believe that the closer you live at the foot of a mountain/river as opposed to living on top of a mountain; there’s a higher correlation to saying App-uh-lah-cha
    It better be AH-Cha, or else I'm raising hell about cultural appropriation. 

t. A guy who can't say "lawyer" right because of this place.
        I, too, am cursed to say "lorr-yer" for the rest of my days.
    What about “apple-ay-she-a”? 
        I've never heard this word said out loud and until just now assumed it was "app-uh-latch-ee-ah" 
            I've always heard ap-uh-lay-sha
                That's wrong
            Born and raised in Southern Appalachia, "latch" is correct, the 'i' is silent. 
App-uh-latch-uh. 
                My wife was born and raised in WV and says Apple-ay-she-uh. All of her friends and everyone I've met in WV either says it that way, or with a hard ch like Apple-ay-chia.
                    Fascinating, I'm from Eastern TN / Western NC and the only people I've ever heard say "Appalayshia" were visitors. Must be more region-specific than I thought. 
        Yes.
    As a native Appalachian, as say Apple-ay-chia, or Apple-ay-cha depending on how fast you’re talking.
        In Northern California we say App-uh-*LAY*-shuh (or App-uh-*LAY*-shun), no hard "ch" at the end.
  
-
Could someone go look up how David Attenborough says it, the authority on Earth?
            What would you love more Attenborough OR GG prenouncing IT?
            We're taught App-uh-lay-shun in Canada too.
Googling it, it seems like only the south call it App-uh-latch-uhn
                As a native of these mountains it's pronounced Appa-latch-a everyone else says it wromg
        Also a native Appalachian, everyone here says App-uh-lay-sha. We're in northern Appalachia though so maybe that makes a difference? 
            Southern, so probably.
                Funny how there's such a difference, but it's a huge region so you'll have this, I guess. 
    I went there and the locals call of appalAHcah
        It really just depends. I’ve travelled all through the mountain range, and I’ve heard it pronounced both ways equally. I do think in WV they do prefer AH over AY though.
            Any local I've met in the WV, VA, TN, KY, area have the Ah
                In NC, we call say -ah- as well
            Yeah, and people who live in WV pronounce HOUSE with a long O, and Wash like WARSH, so no one but a west virginian is gonna care anyway.
                Never met a person from WV that pronounces anything like that. My wife was born and raised there and we go back to visit and vacation.
        Which part?  It spans several states...
            Sorry, should have clarified. I meant West Virginia
    How about appa-lackhia? 
    It's neither. It's 'appa-LA-cha'.
        I was close with appa-la-chi-ah.
    Born and raised wvian. 

It more like "apple latch uh". But more of a "appa-LATCH-uh".  


    Grew up near the Appalachian Trail in Virginia. We always said apple-AY-chian. Actually never heard of the other way until just a couple years ago.

THAT'S A BANJO YOU UNION LOVIN' YANKEE FUCK!
    West Virginia was a Union state
        Not enough people realize this. 
            It even left Virginia to be a Union state
        West Virginia was so pro-Union that the state came into being because they refused to secede with the rest of Virginia
            And some of the coal miners there paid with their lives for the right to unionize and demand better working conditions. The watershed moment was the [Battle of Blair Mountain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Blair_Mountain?wprov=sfla1).
&nbsp;

And one of the possible origins of the word "redneck" is from these pro-union miners who all wore red bandanas to show their affiliation.

Now for all to criticize how it’s pronounced. 
Looks like they’ve brought weapon condition back into the game too. Should make for rethinked play styles after F4’s invincible weapons 
Makes sense given that a trend seen with every 3D fallout except Fallout 3 was the map is named not after the state it inhabits but the name of the geological region it sits in. 
    Fallout 3 was the capital wasteland.

Capital isn't a state.  And it takes place in DC, Maryland and Virginia.
        Also a small part of Pennsylvania, according to Fallout 4.
            Pittsburgh!
                I was actually referring to the base game. According to Fallout 4, Raven Rock, and by extension the rest of the northern most part of the map, are in Pennsylvania.
                    Well according to actual geography raven rock is in Pennsylvania so it makes sense. 
                    Also according to real life. Raven Rock (aka "Site R") is an actual place.
    Not exact. “Commonwealth” is abbreviated from “The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the official state name. 
        I thought while it was true Mass. had it in the name, *The Commonwealth* came from the *New England Commonwealth*, the government created in 1969 from the former states of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut.
    Yeah ummm ONLY the Mojave wasteland was named after a geographical region
I’d prefer “Appalachian Wasteland” 
I was hoping for Waste Virginia. 
    Country rooads...
The only thing better than a guitar sword? [Keyswordtar.](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6863/1447/400/strongbad_keyswordtar.jpg)
CND!
Did everyone know there was going to be weapon condition again? That’s news to me.
    Yea, it's been known for quite a while now to those who are keeping a close eye on the game. There's a few perk cards that were shown way back that affect your weapon's condition.
App-uh-latcha-uh
Let the "Aitch" vs "Atch" feud begin!
I can't help but feel this would be more on point than a sword:

    I fucking love this

Guitar Sword.
Yes. I’m ready.
How has nobody mentions weapon condition yet??
Im from Ontario Canada, and I don't mean to intrude, but I pronounce it App-a-laytch-uh.
very good name but unfortunately I am not even mildly hyped for this game and fallout is my favorite franchise! whats wrong with me :(

RDR2 fever probably
    I'm not hyped either. Everything about it doesn't feel Fallout to me.
honestly, this is the first fallout that i've had lukewarm feelings toward.  not liking the whole 'destiny goes grunge, mmo style' setup it's going for.  so far it's starting to sound like rust with a different brand name strapped to it.  i just hope the next 'actual' fallout game does a bit better on the whole plot motivation because 3 and 4's motivator sucked ass, here go find someone you as a player have zero fucking attachment to, where at least with new vegas you had blind seething vengeance to run off of for a bit
    I totally agree. 1&2 easily had the best motivations imo. Your home is dying, elder/overseer tell you to go fix it. You were tasked with the main quest rather than just expected to do it. 
        even then there's no concrete establishment of wanting to do it, unless you already know you're on a time limit like in 1, 2 however has nothing driving you towards the main story after you leave the village other than the meek attachment the player may feel towards the village.  i'd personally like to see you create your character after the major drive has been established, like you having been enslaved or conscripted by a major faction, or possibly have you as the child of an enclave officer fleeing their impending destruction at the hands of the brotherhood, or (and i hate to use old rpg tropes) have you survive the massacre of your family/village/self by a powerful group
            >even then there's no concrete establishment of wanting to do it, unless you already know you're on a time limit like in 1, 2 however has nothing driving you towards the main story after you leave the village other than the meek attachment the player may feel towards the village.  

Well besides the gameplay. The games both kinda railroad you by only showing you a town at a time in the beginning. So you will instinctually follow the main quest. Also with the way the story is, it feels more like a job. It has been assigned to you rather than assumed you desire something. 

>i'd personally like to see you create your character after the major drive has been established, like you having been enslaved or conscripted by a major faction, or possibly have you as the child of an enclave officer fleeing their impending destruction at the hands of the brotherhood, or (and i hate to use old rpg tropes) have you survive the massacre of your family/village/self by a powerful group

Eh, I think the second (and third) suggestion approach new vegas’ level of motivation and lack the strength that imo makes 1&2 stand stronger with regards to rp. However, I do like the first as it does allow for that freedom.  

The overall point is to avoid using pathos for characters motivation unless you are going to put in the leg work and actually get to know them before the journey begins. 
                yeah they all really railroad you, even vegas does even though it's more physical like in the case of vegas like 1&2, honestly i just hope the motivation is more visceral instead of attachment like the last couple games.  hell i don't care if they do like dead space and have your motivation be nothing more than to just survive running away from some big bad boogeyman 
                    I wouldn’t mind that. I’m just not a huge fan of pathos for a motivation. Especially because, at least in this series, it tends to be used a little lazily. 
                        you aren't going to hear me argue that they don't use it as a lazy writing mechanic
pronounced "app-uh-LAHH-chuhh"
I’m going to murder all of you out there I’m gonna play as psychopath for the thrill and erection 
Almost heaven... Appalachia
I have zero motivation to play this game unless they enable crossplay, but Sony will never play nice.
Yeah that makes sense.
I guess we'll just have to wait for Todd to name the map after himself. 
Is it gonna be Appalachia or the Appalachian Wasteland
Can I get some sauce on this?
    I linked it at the top of my description 
        Top lad
Whenever I hear applapachia I can only think of that Dr who episode
Depends on how much money your family has and how hard they're trying to sound like they're not from the region. Pretentious academic wanting to sound removed from the poverty culture surrounding the region: app-a-lay-shuh
Everyone else: apple-atcha
Appalachia Wasteland has a nice ring to it
Eh, a bit lame IMHO. That's just the informal name for that area of the world anyway, why didn't they come up with an original Fallout-y name?
    Yea! like the Mojave...or the commonwealth....shit.
        Lol, I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not, but point taken
The return of weapon condition/durability the screenshot shows is pretty cool. Worth noting, although maybe that was announced earlier and I missed it
    It was.
I kind of doubt this considering that not only have they called it West Virginia in every other instance, but even the [print map](https://www.offgamers.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/fallout-76-power-armor-edition.jpg) that's part of the power armor edition says "West Virginia" on it.
Almost heaven, Appalachia 
There's nothing you could say to get me excited for this dumpster fire. Especially when Fallout 4 New Vegas is soon to be a thing.
    Then why even bother commenting on a thread about it? 
        Feel cool and superior on a message board about a video game? 
            Don’t see how one would feel superior for bitching about not buying a certain game.
                Then why post? I’m not buying it either but don’t need to announce it. 
                    Thats what I was saying to begin with... I was asking the other person why they felt the need to announce the fact that they weren’t buying the game..
                        Yeah, i was answering your question. People need validation when they don’t like something others enjoy (or are anticipating). I don’t play multiplayer games but I get why “Fallout MMO” is a good idea.  There are other games I’ll play and enjoy. No need to search for validation on the internet. 
If they ever make a Fallout in Florida (Yes, I know Fallout: Miami exists, but I'm talking a real entry) I think The Peninsula Wasteland would suit it!
    That's redundant
        True, it is a bit. Couldn't think of much else. But that's no reason to downvote me, I mean come on.
            Not me
Doesn't matter if it's not on steam. 
I am so bloodthirsty to kill u in this game
Cool! Sounds like it’s gonna be in southern us. Cool! That’s my home, where country roads take me.
Appalachia: 4 syllables

West Virginia: 4 Syllables

TAKE ME HOME

COUNTRY ROAD

APPALACHIA

MOUNTAIN MAMA

TAKE ME HOME

EDIT: Stupid mistake
    You must speak very strangely if you think Appalachia has 3 syllables. 
        I can see an argument for Appalachia. I don't see how "West Virginia" has 3 in any logical pronunciation.
[deleted]
    > With only 25 years since the bombs there’s no lore or precedence to rename anything. 

Who's renaming anything? West Virginia is entirely within the real Appalachia.
        [deleted]
            It's called the Commonwealth because that's what the area was referred to as pre-war (ya know, like how MIT is now the [Commonwealth Institute of Technology](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/C.I.T._ruins)).

The Capital Wasteland is called that since it's around the Capital. 

And it's called the Mojave because... you get it. 

All of those regions have names rooted in their Pre-War regional names. Why shouldn't Appalachia? 
                [deleted]
                    Yeah, except all the people who call the region that irl, and presumably in the fallout universe *pre-war*. The people who would have entered the vault would call the region that. They would tell their children that's what the area is called. When you leave the vault, that's what you know the region as.

It's like you're intentionally trying to not get it at this point. 
    Iirc, it's actually 125 years since bomb drop
Only one. Itll take you home tho.

p.s. thank you
Ikr. What an incredible weapon. Yet another thing to conflict me on purchasing this game.
    It’s cool looking for sure but you couldn’t play it right? Wouldn’t you have to be able to fret it?
        Correct. It could only be played “open” or in other words the only notes that could be played are whatever the strings are tuned to. If you did something like a pentatonic scale though that gives you some decent room to work with. 
            You could play it with a slide. With slide guitar you press the slide against the strings just hard enough to change the note. You’d probably have to play by ear cause it lacks the markings. 
                You would definitely have to play by ear, and without something behind the slide to press against I'm still not convinced you'd be able to get a good sound, but I've never tried to play slide on a guitar without a fretboard so I really wouldn't know. I could be surprised at how well the slide alone is able to prevent vibration up the string and therefor result in a higher pitch. 

I've played guitar for many many years now, and completely rebuilt my strat squire with all new electronics to make a sort of franken-strat. Really want to buy a kit to build a telecaster. 
                    I play cigar box guitars, on my current slide guitar there’s a 1/4 inch of space between the strings and the neck. Pressing the strings hard enough to get to the board would be uncomfortable and sound terrible. With a slide guitar it’s more like you’re bringing the fret down on the string than bringing the strings down to the fret. 
                        Yeah I get the concept, I just didn't know if that would be enough to make a "seal" so to speak, but based ont he way you described it it makes a lot of sense. I actually really appreciate the simile you used. 
                            I didn't even think it was as complicated as that- when the slide touches the strings it becomes the fret. You slide around with the strings not even touching the fretboard or frets. You could have a foot of space away from the board and still play. Take this guitar sword and grab one of the many glass bottles around and you got the blues. I doubt it because, well, it's a Bethesda (aka Missed Opportunities Inc.) game but having like a bard class that plays music at settlements would be rad as fuck and is exactly why it probably won't happen.

J/K Bethesda love you guys thx 4 da memories
                    Lap steel guitars are essentially fretless because the strings are raised so far up. So assume it would be a little like that. 
                    you don't press down to the board with a slide, the slide acts as the fret
                    You dont press against anything with a slide, the slide itself acts as the fret. It would totally work. Whether it would sound good eith a guitar like that is another matter
            They could do what Rust did, where the guitar plays a different note depending how high or low you aim the crosshairs
        I enjoy your pun
    I mean people are gonna port all these weapons to fo4 so won't have too still!
        [deleted]
            Literally just extract model file then port it to fo4 it's the same engine and I beet that did not change model structure and it also seems they are not making many new animations. All you would have to do is post to lovers lab and not Nexus/bnet. 
        No, people won't, because it'll get shut down in a heart beat.

E: Imagine down voting someone because you don't like being reminded that intellectual property laws exist. 
            [removed]
                If people try to port stuff from F76 to FO4 then Nexus and Bethesda will shut it down. It's happened before with people trying to port FO3 content to FNV
                    [removed]
                        They'll still receive a cease and desist and legal action if it continues. 
                            *cough*a tale of two wastelands*cough*
                                *cough* that's only allowed because it requires you to own a legal copy of both FO3 and FNV and won't allow you to illegally obtain access to asset you haven't bought the rights to access by owning both games *cough*
                            [removed]
                                Imagine pirating a fucking shitty weapon model. Fuck me kid, just take the L that people won't put the effort into porting this shit
                    People ported the LAER from FNV to Fo4 and it's still there.
                        That wasn't a port. That was a mod, with its own original model and textures. People can mod the new F76 weapons into FO4 all they like, but they can't take the models or the textures and just port them in. 
                            This is just coming down to a battle of what terms are used. The bottom line is that LAER existed in FNV and someone made it for Fo4. Is it a "port" of something from FNV? Technically, no. Is it something from FNV that now exists in Fo4? Yes, and continually does so.
                                No, it comes down to, people won't be able to port the models and textures from F76 into FO4 because they legally can't do it. They can recreate something similar and mod it in but they can't port it. Making my initial statement correct. 
            They don't care if you port from 1 Bethesda game to another. They might now but I doubt they would get rid of mod support for 76 then also ban using any assets from it. We can see this by looking at atale of two wastelands mod that literally ports all of fallout 3 to 4.
                They do care. Because legally they have to care, if they allow one modder to redistribute their assets freely then they lose precedence to go after other people who do the same. TTW doesn't allow people to play Fallout 3 or use an of its asset for free. It requires people to own the full FO3 GOTY and the full FNV Ultimate edition. It's not redistributing assets or content for free to people who don't own the license to access that content.

I can prove to you they do care because they won't allow to Fallout 4 Capital Wasteland mod to use the FO3 audio assets. 
                    Audio is a bigger deal due to voice actor contracts but heres how to get around it. Do the exact same thing they did and make a installer that extracts and adds to fo4.
                        It's not a bigger deal, it's the exact same deal, it's about intellectual property and licensing and all that shit. And if someone wanted to go through that effort that'd be fine. But it still doesn't dispute my point that people won't just be "porting it to FO4" 
                            im even you really could jsut not upload it to nexus and bnet. bethesda is not gonna go threw 10000 hoops to take down a mod off some random site that gets few thousand visitors a day at most.
                                If they know about it they will, because they have to legally to have any precedent against other cases. You make one exception then other companies and people start to do the same and you have no foot to stand on in court. 
    When was that shown?
    I don't see why you would be conflicted. Wait for the reviews. If it looks like something you would enjoy playing, buy it. If it doesn't look like something you would enjoy playing, don't buy it.
Now I can kill my enemies, to the sweet sounds of country roads, take me home
    I hope to be a bard.

And join me in my room of punstoppable outcasts
That’s normal West Virginia though
Mmmm that is a tasty pun.
Maybe they're calling it Appalachia in case they want to expand the map outside of West Virginia in the future.
    Shit we haven't even mentioned this yet. Where the DLC gonna be, boys? 
        They *could* expand to actual quests at some point and involve the Enclave. But that's me, being wishful. 
            I guess the enclave would be neat, but what business would they have in some midwest shithole shortly after the bombs dropped?
                Greenbrier bunker? 
                    Hmm fair point, not sure if it'd be relevant enough of a place but it'd be a valid enough excuse
                And West Virginia isn't in the Midwest. Part of the state is within a couple hours (depending on traffic) of Washington DC. It borders Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and regular Virginia, none of which are Midwestern states either.
&nbsp;

I don't want to sound like I'm coming down too hard on you here . Geography can be hard for some people to remember, even if they live nearby. I spent years thinking that Savannah and Augusta (Georgia) were in basically the same place. 
                Midwest?
                    Sory am from punjab pakistan forgive for not knw geography 🙏
                        It’s okay!! West Virginia is very East ironically the only thing separating it from the East Coast is Virginia and Pennsylvania if I remember correctly 
        They said no DLC just updates, that is no must purchase DLCs like in the other games
        It's gonna be a VR thing like Operation Anchorage. You find an old high-tech entertainment arcade and do some quests to get it running. Then you climb into the VR pod and everything goes dark. You hear wood creaking and the sound of horses, and your vision fades in to to the sight of snowy rocks and pine trees. You hear a voice: "Hey, you, you’re finally awake. You were trying to cross the border right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush same as us and that thief over there."
            TOOOOOOOOODD

    It was a joke ;)
I mean it’s still West Virginia. It just has a funny name.
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachia
A-ppa-la-chiaaaaaaaaa 
    As someone who has lived in the region, I feel obligated to point out that it's pronounced
&nbsp;

**App-uh-lach-uh**, not App-uh-lay-chuh. 
What? The copious amounts of chems already featured in every Fallout isn't enough for you?
    We just need empty syringes of Med-X and bottles of Mentats fucking everywhere, like empty alcohol bottles 
        A few Daddy-O syringes sprinkled in there as well. I want that chem to make a come back!
    There's enough drugs and paraphernalia floating around Appalachia (eastern KY and WV specifically) to make FO3, FO:NV and FO4 look drug free.
Man if they'd have a run at the Seattle area...we have a town nicknamed Tweakerville for a reason.
    If Bethesda ever goes West coast again, the Portland-Seattle area would be great. Wouldn't look too different in some areas, though.
        The area by union station (amtrack station in downtown Portland) straight looked like it was out of fallout this summer with the forts and homes these homeless people were building 
            That's always Seattle. 
Ballard is bad too

                It’s so bad in Seattle too, I was up for a wknd like 3 weeks ago and was staying in an air bnb right next to Chinatown. Super pretty city but I walked around one morning at 7am and it allowed me to see how bad the homeless situation was (I even got grabbed from behind by a dude ) 
        More than west coast again, I just wish they make the next game set near the Great Lakes. I wonder how Detroit turned out. (I don’t like the Seattle/Oregon idea, I just wanna see how detroit turned out)

And I wonder how Bethesda will treat fallout Miami in terms of lore. If they don’t acknowledge it, they better make a game of their own set around Florida and southeast. 

And I wonder if we can get a game set in Canada. Apparently the US annexed Canada in the FO universe and I’m curious how Canadian east and west coast turned out. 
            I've always thought a Fallout game in Canada would be perfect. There could be a ton of pre-war "You're an American now, act like it!" Propaganda stuff everywhere. Would be very very cool. And probably rather cold.
        We're getting a very promising looking mod set in that area called Fallout Cascadia.
    Yeah, Chinatown would give fallout a run for its money 
    You mean Olympia..
I recall hearing something about a pharmaceutical manufacturing facility being in-game at some point, so some of it will surely be there.

    West Virginia
        
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River


Life is old there, older than the trees


Younger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze


Country roads, take me home

To the place I belong


West Virginia, mountain mama


Take me home, country roads


All my memories gather round her


Miner's lady, stranger to blue water


Dark and dusty, painted on the sky


Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye


Country roads, take me home


To the place I belong


West Virginia, mountain mama


Take me home, country roads


I hear her voice, in the morning hour she calls me


The radio reminds me of my home far away


And driving down the road I get a feeling


That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday


Country roads, take me home


To the place I belong


West Virginia, mountain mama


Take me home, country roads


Country roads, take me home


To the place I belong


West Virginia, mountain mama


Take me home, country roads


Take me home, down country roads


Take me home, down country roads

App uh latch in is how it's pronounced and I expect nothing but accuracy from Bethesda. Otherwise alot of us fallout fans in the mountains are going to be pissed 
    Imagine how upset people in Boston were when the DLC wasn't Fah Hahbah.
        Proud Mainer here, very disappointed it wasn't Fah Hahbah and that there wasn't a line I heard referring to mirelurk hunters as "them lobstahs"
            "yeah theyah vawlt dwellah, we been gettin hit by these fahkin yuge lobstahs, and i don't think theyall go inna soup, if you know what im sayin" 
                I don't, sorry.
                    Well a humph and a discontented grumble to you too cranky
                        Haha. Wasn't trying to be cranky, I was on board until the second comma then I didn't understand what they were getting at. 
                            I just read the comment and now I'm confused at what that last sentence that dude said was about too... 
                                See! I'm not an ass, just a confused non-New Englander.
        Hehehhehehe
    Uh, the most disappointing thing in FO3 was when the protectron guarding the declaration of independence introduced himself as Button Gwinn-it. It's pronounced Gwi-net.

Button Gwinnett was a founding father and repsentative of Georgia who signed the declaration. I grew up in the county next to the one named after him. 
        Actually if he was from geoegia his accent might be to blame for him saying Gwin it
    As someone who lives in the foothills of those mountains, APPA LAY CHA.
        Us civilized folks in Western NC say Ap uh latch uh, because we're not savages. 
            East Tennessee here and that’s exactly right.
                Going to Gatlinburg for New Years! If I hear AppaLAYchan while I'm there, 2019 will be ruined. 
                    Don't worry most in Gatlinburg say it correctly the damn tourist on the other hands not so much. SWVA here. They better say some of the town names correctly if they are featured as well
            This is the only correct way right here^^^
        Me too. Although the last syllable is sometimes pronounced more like "sha" than "cha".
        Yes, definitely this one.
        Traitor
WVian, I’ve travelled all around the state. In my honest opinion I believe that the closer you live at the foot of a mountain/river as opposed to living on top of a mountain; there’s a higher correlation to saying App-uh-lah-cha
It better be AH-Cha, or else I'm raising hell about cultural appropriation. 

t. A guy who can't say "lawyer" right because of this place.
    I, too, am cursed to say "lorr-yer" for the rest of my days.
What about “apple-ay-she-a”? 
    I've never heard this word said out loud and until just now assumed it was "app-uh-latch-ee-ah" 
        I've always heard ap-uh-lay-sha
            That's wrong
        Born and raised in Southern Appalachia, "latch" is correct, the 'i' is silent. 
App-uh-latch-uh. 
            My wife was born and raised in WV and says Apple-ay-she-uh. All of her friends and everyone I've met in WV either says it that way, or with a hard ch like Apple-ay-chia.
                Fascinating, I'm from Eastern TN / Western NC and the only people I've ever heard say "Appalayshia" were visitors. Must be more region-specific than I thought. 
    Yes.
As a native Appalachian, as say Apple-ay-chia, or Apple-ay-cha depending on how fast you’re talking.
    In Northern California we say App-uh-*LAY*-shuh (or App-uh-*LAY*-shun), no hard "ch" at the end.
  
-
Could someone go look up how David Attenborough says it, the authority on Earth?
        What would you love more Attenborough OR GG prenouncing IT?
        We're taught App-uh-lay-shun in Canada too.
Googling it, it seems like only the south call it App-uh-latch-uhn
            As a native of these mountains it's pronounced Appa-latch-a everyone else says it wromg
    Also a native Appalachian, everyone here says App-uh-lay-sha. We're in northern Appalachia though so maybe that makes a difference? 
        Southern, so probably.
            Funny how there's such a difference, but it's a huge region so you'll have this, I guess. 
I went there and the locals call of appalAHcah
    It really just depends. I’ve travelled all through the mountain range, and I’ve heard it pronounced both ways equally. I do think in WV they do prefer AH over AY though.
        Any local I've met in the WV, VA, TN, KY, area have the Ah
            In NC, we call say -ah- as well
        Yeah, and people who live in WV pronounce HOUSE with a long O, and Wash like WARSH, so no one but a west virginian is gonna care anyway.
            Never met a person from WV that pronounces anything like that. My wife was born and raised there and we go back to visit and vacation.
    Which part?  It spans several states...
        Sorry, should have clarified. I meant West Virginia
How about appa-lackhia? 
It's neither. It's 'appa-LA-cha'.
    I was close with appa-la-chi-ah.
Born and raised wvian. 

It more like "apple latch uh". But more of a "appa-LATCH-uh".  


Grew up near the Appalachian Trail in Virginia. We always said apple-AY-chian. Actually never heard of the other way until just a couple years ago. 
West Virginia was a Union state
    Not enough people realize this. 
        It even left Virginia to be a Union state
    West Virginia was so pro-Union that the state came into being because they refused to secede with the rest of Virginia
        And some of the coal miners there paid with their lives for the right to unionize and demand better working conditions. The watershed moment was the [Battle of Blair Mountain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Blair_Mountain?wprov=sfla1).
&nbsp;

And one of the possible origins of the word "redneck" is from these pro-union miners who all wore red bandanas to show their affiliation.

Fallout 3 was the capital wasteland.

Capital isn't a state.  And it takes place in DC, Maryland and Virginia.
    Also a small part of Pennsylvania, according to Fallout 4.
        Pittsburgh!
            I was actually referring to the base game. According to Fallout 4, Raven Rock, and by extension the rest of the northern most part of the map, are in Pennsylvania.
                Well according to actual geography raven rock is in Pennsylvania so it makes sense. 
                Also according to real life. Raven Rock (aka "Site R") is an actual place.
Not exact. “Commonwealth” is abbreviated from “The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the official state name. 
    I thought while it was true Mass. had it in the name, *The Commonwealth* came from the *New England Commonwealth*, the government created in 1969 from the former states of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut.
Yeah ummm ONLY the Mojave wasteland was named after a geographical region
Country rooads...
Yea, it's been known for quite a while now to those who are keeping a close eye on the game. There's a few perk cards that were shown way back that affect your weapon's condition.
I fucking love this 
    You might also enjoy this one:

I'm not hyped either. Everything about it doesn't feel Fallout to me.
I totally agree. 1&2 easily had the best motivations imo. Your home is dying, elder/overseer tell you to go fix it. You were tasked with the main quest rather than just expected to do it. 
    even then there's no concrete establishment of wanting to do it, unless you already know you're on a time limit like in 1, 2 however has nothing driving you towards the main story after you leave the village other than the meek attachment the player may feel towards the village.  i'd personally like to see you create your character after the major drive has been established, like you having been enslaved or conscripted by a major faction, or possibly have you as the child of an enclave officer fleeing their impending destruction at the hands of the brotherhood, or (and i hate to use old rpg tropes) have you survive the massacre of your family/village/self by a powerful group
        >even then there's no concrete establishment of wanting to do it, unless you already know you're on a time limit like in 1, 2 however has nothing driving you towards the main story after you leave the village other than the meek attachment the player may feel towards the village.  

Well besides the gameplay. The games both kinda railroad you by only showing you a town at a time in the beginning. So you will instinctually follow the main quest. Also with the way the story is, it feels more like a job. It has been assigned to you rather than assumed you desire something. 

>i'd personally like to see you create your character after the major drive has been established, like you having been enslaved or conscripted by a major faction, or possibly have you as the child of an enclave officer fleeing their impending destruction at the hands of the brotherhood, or (and i hate to use old rpg tropes) have you survive the massacre of your family/village/self by a powerful group

Eh, I think the second (and third) suggestion approach new vegas’ level of motivation and lack the strength that imo makes 1&2 stand stronger with regards to rp. However, I do like the first as it does allow for that freedom.  

The overall point is to avoid using pathos for characters motivation unless you are going to put in the leg work and actually get to know them before the journey begins. 
            yeah they all really railroad you, even vegas does even though it's more physical like in the case of vegas like 1&2, honestly i just hope the motivation is more visceral instead of attachment like the last couple games.  hell i don't care if they do like dead space and have your motivation be nothing more than to just survive running away from some big bad boogeyman 
                I wouldn’t mind that. I’m just not a huge fan of pathos for a motivation. Especially because, at least in this series, it tends to be used a little lazily. 
                    you aren't going to hear me argue that they don't use it as a lazy writing mechanic
I linked it at the top of my description 
    Top lad
Yea! like the Mojave...or the commonwealth....shit.
    Lol, I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not, but point taken
It was.
Then why even bother commenting on a thread about it? 
    Feel cool and superior on a message board about a video game? 
        Don’t see how one would feel superior for bitching about not buying a certain game.
            Then why post? I’m not buying it either but don’t need to announce it. 
                Thats what I was saying to begin with... I was asking the other person why they felt the need to announce the fact that they weren’t buying the game..
                    Yeah, i was answering your question. People need validation when they don’t like something others enjoy (or are anticipating). I don’t play multiplayer games but I get why “Fallout MMO” is a good idea.  There are other games I’ll play and enjoy. No need to search for validation on the internet. 
That's redundant
    True, it is a bit. Couldn't think of much else. But that's no reason to downvote me, I mean come on.
        Not me
You must speak very strangely if you think Appalachia has 3 syllables. 
    I can see an argument for Appalachia. I don't see how "West Virginia" has 3 in any logical pronunciation.
> With only 25 years since the bombs there’s no lore or precedence to rename anything. 

Who's renaming anything? West Virginia is entirely within the real Appalachia.
    [deleted]
        It's called the Commonwealth because that's what the area was referred to as pre-war (ya know, like how MIT is now the [Commonwealth Institute of Technology](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/C.I.T._ruins)).

The Capital Wasteland is called that since it's around the Capital. 

And it's called the Mojave because... you get it. 

All of those regions have names rooted in their Pre-War regional names. Why shouldn't Appalachia? 
            [deleted]
                Yeah, except all the people who call the region that irl, and presumably in the fallout universe *pre-war*. The people who would have entered the vault would call the region that. They would tell their children that's what the area is called. When you leave the vault, that's what you know the region as.

It's like you're intentionally trying to not get it at this point. 
Iirc, it's actually 125 years since bomb drop

p.s. thank you
It’s cool looking for sure but you couldn’t play it right? Wouldn’t you have to be able to fret it?
    Correct. It could only be played “open” or in other words the only notes that could be played are whatever the strings are tuned to. If you did something like a pentatonic scale though that gives you some decent room to work with. 
        You could play it with a slide. With slide guitar you press the slide against the strings just hard enough to change the note. You’d probably have to play by ear cause it lacks the markings. 
            You would definitely have to play by ear, and without something behind the slide to press against I'm still not convinced you'd be able to get a good sound, but I've never tried to play slide on a guitar without a fretboard so I really wouldn't know. I could be surprised at how well the slide alone is able to prevent vibration up the string and therefor result in a higher pitch. 

I've played guitar for many many years now, and completely rebuilt my strat squire with all new electronics to make a sort of franken-strat. Really want to buy a kit to build a telecaster. 
                I play cigar box guitars, on my current slide guitar there’s a 1/4 inch of space between the strings and the neck. Pressing the strings hard enough to get to the board would be uncomfortable and sound terrible. With a slide guitar it’s more like you’re bringing the fret down on the string than bringing the strings down to the fret. 
                    Yeah I get the concept, I just didn't know if that would be enough to make a "seal" so to speak, but based ont he way you described it it makes a lot of sense. I actually really appreciate the simile you used. 
                        I didn't even think it was as complicated as that- when the slide touches the strings it becomes the fret. You slide around with the strings not even touching the fretboard or frets. You could have a foot of space away from the board and still play. Take this guitar sword and grab one of the many glass bottles around and you got the blues. I doubt it because, well, it's a Bethesda (aka Missed Opportunities Inc.) game but having like a bard class that plays music at settlements would be rad as fuck and is exactly why it probably won't happen.

J/K Bethesda love you guys thx 4 da memories
                Lap steel guitars are essentially fretless because the strings are raised so far up. So assume it would be a little like that. 
                you don't press down to the board with a slide, the slide acts as the fret
                You dont press against anything with a slide, the slide itself acts as the fret. It would totally work. Whether it would sound good eith a guitar like that is another matter
        They could do what Rust did, where the guitar plays a different note depending how high or low you aim the crosshairs
    I enjoy your pun
I mean people are gonna port all these weapons to fo4 so won't have too still!
    [deleted]
        Literally just extract model file then port it to fo4 it's the same engine and I beet that did not change model structure and it also seems they are not making many new animations. All you would have to do is post to lovers lab and not Nexus/bnet. 
    No, people won't, because it'll get shut down in a heart beat.

E: Imagine down voting someone because you don't like being reminded that intellectual property laws exist. 
        [removed]
            If people try to port stuff from F76 to FO4 then Nexus and Bethesda will shut it down. It's happened before with people trying to port FO3 content to FNV
                [removed]
                    They'll still receive a cease and desist and legal action if it continues. 
                        *cough*a tale of two wastelands*cough*
                            *cough* that's only allowed because it requires you to own a legal copy of both FO3 and FNV and won't allow you to illegally obtain access to asset you haven't bought the rights to access by owning both games *cough*
                        [removed]
                            Imagine pirating a fucking shitty weapon model. Fuck me kid, just take the L that people won't put the effort into porting this shit
                People ported the LAER from FNV to Fo4 and it's still there.
                    That wasn't a port. That was a mod, with its own original model and textures. People can mod the new F76 weapons into FO4 all they like, but they can't take the models or the textures and just port them in. 
                        This is just coming down to a battle of what terms are used. The bottom line is that LAER existed in FNV and someone made it for Fo4. Is it a "port" of something from FNV? Technically, no. Is it something from FNV that now exists in Fo4? Yes, and continually does so.
                            No, it comes down to, people won't be able to port the models and textures from F76 into FO4 because they legally can't do it. They can recreate something similar and mod it in but they can't port it. Making my initial statement correct. 
        They don't care if you port from 1 Bethesda game to another. They might now but I doubt they would get rid of mod support for 76 then also ban using any assets from it. We can see this by looking at atale of two wastelands mod that literally ports all of fallout 3 to 4.
            They do care. Because legally they have to care, if they allow one modder to redistribute their assets freely then they lose precedence to go after other people who do the same. TTW doesn't allow people to play Fallout 3 or use an of its asset for free. It requires people to own the full FO3 GOTY and the full FNV Ultimate edition. It's not redistributing assets or content for free to people who don't own the license to access that content.

I can prove to you they do care because they won't allow to Fallout 4 Capital Wasteland mod to use the FO3 audio assets. 
                Audio is a bigger deal due to voice actor contracts but heres how to get around it. Do the exact same thing they did and make a installer that extracts and adds to fo4.
                    It's not a bigger deal, it's the exact same deal, it's about intellectual property and licensing and all that shit. And if someone wanted to go through that effort that'd be fine. But it still doesn't dispute my point that people won't just be "porting it to FO4" 
                        im even you really could jsut not upload it to nexus and bnet. bethesda is not gonna go threw 10000 hoops to take down a mod off some random site that gets few thousand visitors a day at most.
                            If they know about it they will, because they have to legally to have any precedent against other cases. You make one exception then other companies and people start to do the same and you have no foot to stand on in court. 
When was that shown?
I don't see why you would be conflicted. Wait for the reviews. If it looks like something you would enjoy playing, buy it. If it doesn't look like something you would enjoy playing, don't buy it.
I hope to be a bard. 
How about the scrapyard named Scrapyard

Shit we haven't even mentioned this yet. Where the DLC gonna be, boys? 
    They *could* expand to actual quests at some point and involve the Enclave. But that's me, being wishful. 
        I guess the enclave would be neat, but what business would they have in some midwest shithole shortly after the bombs dropped?
            Greenbrier bunker? 
                Hmm fair point, not sure if it'd be relevant enough of a place but it'd be a valid enough excuse
            And West Virginia isn't in the Midwest. Part of the state is within a couple hours (depending on traffic) of Washington DC. It borders Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and regular Virginia, none of which are Midwestern states either.
&nbsp;

I don't want to sound like I'm coming down too hard on you here . Geography can be hard for some people to remember, even if they live nearby. I spent years thinking that Savannah and Augusta (Georgia) were in basically the same place. 
            Midwest?
                Sory am from punjab pakistan forgive for not knw geography 🙏
                    It’s okay!! West Virginia is very East ironically the only thing separating it from the East Coast is Virginia and Pennsylvania if I remember correctly 
    They said no DLC just updates, that is no must purchase DLCs like in the other games
    It's gonna be a VR thing like Operation Anchorage. You find an old high-tech entertainment arcade and do some quests to get it running. Then you climb into the VR pod and everything goes dark. You hear wood creaking and the sound of horses, and your vision fades in to to the sight of snowy rocks and pine trees. You hear a voice: "Hey, you, you’re finally awake. You were trying to cross the border right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush same as us and that thief over there."

&nbsp;

**App-uh-lach-uh**, not App-uh-lay-chuh. 
We just need empty syringes of Med-X and bottles of Mentats fucking everywhere, like empty alcohol bottles 
    A few Daddy-O syringes sprinkled in there as well. I want that chem to make a come back!
There's enough drugs and paraphernalia floating around Appalachia (eastern KY and WV specifically) to make FO3, FO:NV and FO4 look drug free.
If Bethesda ever goes West coast again, the Portland-Seattle area would be great. Wouldn't look too different in some areas, though.
    The area by union station (amtrack station in downtown Portland) straight looked like it was out of fallout this summer with the forts and homes these homeless people were building 
        That's always Seattle. 
Ballard is bad too

            It’s so bad in Seattle too, I was up for a wknd like 3 weeks ago and was staying in an air bnb right next to Chinatown. Super pretty city but I walked around one morning at 7am and it allowed me to see how bad the homeless situation was (I even got grabbed from behind by a dude ) 
    More than west coast again, I just wish they make the next game set near the Great Lakes. I wonder how Detroit turned out. (I don’t like the Seattle/Oregon idea, I just wanna see how detroit turned out)

And I wonder how Bethesda will treat fallout Miami in terms of lore. If they don’t acknowledge it, they better make a game of their own set around Florida and southeast. 

And I wonder if we can get a game set in Canada. Apparently the US annexed Canada in the FO universe and I’m curious how Canadian east and west coast turned out. 
        I've always thought a Fallout game in Canada would be perfect. There could be a ton of pre-war "You're an American now, act like it!" Propaganda stuff everywhere. Would be very very cool. And probably rather cold.
    We're getting a very promising looking mod set in that area called Fallout Cascadia.
Yeah, Chinatown would give fallout a run for its money

Younger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze

I hear her voice, in the morning hour she calls me


The radio reminds me of my home far away


And driving down the road I get a feeling


That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday


Country roads, take me home


To the place I belong


West Virginia, mountain mama


Take me home, country roads


Country roads, take me home


To the place I belong


West Virginia, mountain mama


Take me home, country roads


Take me home, down country roads


Take me home, down country roads

        Ikr? Thanks for killing it. We need more like this.
This is actually super helpful to remember how to pronounce it, thank you.
Have a virtual, second upvote. I came here to say the same. I live in this mountain range and people cringe when you pronounce it wrong.
It's not app a la pa chia?

            Oh! I thought you were making a reference to an [episode](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Girl_Who_Waited?wprov=sfla1) of Doctor Who. It takes place on a planet whose name sounds like someone reading the word "Appalachia" out loud for the first time. 
Imagine how upset people in Boston were when the DLC wasn't Fah Hahbah.
    Proud Mainer here, very disappointed it wasn't Fah Hahbah and that there wasn't a line I heard referring to mirelurk hunters as "them lobstahs"
        "yeah theyah vawlt dwellah, we been gettin hit by these fahkin yuge lobstahs, and i don't think theyall go inna soup, if you know what im sayin" 
            I don't, sorry.
                Well a humph and a discontented grumble to you too cranky
                    Haha. Wasn't trying to be cranky, I was on board until the second comma then I didn't understand what they were getting at. 
                        I just read the comment and now I'm confused at what that last sentence that dude said was about too... 
                            See! I'm not an ass, just a confused non-New Englander.
    Hehehhehehe
Uh, the most disappointing thing in FO3 was when the protectron guarding the declaration of independence introduced himself as Button Gwinn-it. It's pronounced Gwi-net.

Button Gwinnett was a founding father and repsentative of Georgia who signed the declaration. I grew up in the county next to the one named after him. 
    Actually if he was from geoegia his accent might be to blame for him saying Gwin it
As someone who lives in the foothills of those mountains, APPA LAY CHA.
    Us civilized folks in Western NC say Ap uh latch uh, because we're not savages. 
        East Tennessee here and that’s exactly right.
            Going to Gatlinburg for New Years! If I hear AppaLAYchan while I'm there, 2019 will be ruined. 
                Don't worry most in Gatlinburg say it correctly the damn tourist on the other hands not so much. SWVA here. They better say some of the town names correctly if they are featured as well
        This is the only correct way right here^^^
    Me too. Although the last syllable is sometimes pronounced more like "sha" than "cha".
    Yes, definitely this one.
    Traitor
I, too, am cursed to say "lorr-yer" for the rest of my days.
I've never heard this word said out loud and until just now assumed it was "app-uh-latch-ee-ah" 
    I've always heard ap-uh-lay-sha
        That's wrong
    Born and raised in Southern Appalachia, "latch" is correct, the 'i' is silent. 
App-uh-latch-uh. 
        My wife was born and raised in WV and says Apple-ay-she-uh. All of her friends and everyone I've met in WV either says it that way, or with a hard ch like Apple-ay-chia.
            Fascinating, I'm from Eastern TN / Western NC and the only people I've ever heard say "Appalayshia" were visitors. Must be more region-specific than I thought. 
Yes.
In Northern California we say App-uh-*LAY*-shuh (or App-uh-*LAY*-shun), no hard "ch" at the end.

Could someone go look up how David Attenborough says it, the authority on Earth?
    What would you love more Attenborough OR GG prenouncing IT?
    We're taught App-uh-lay-shun in Canada too.
Googling it, it seems like only the south call it App-uh-latch-uhn
        As a native of these mountains it's pronounced Appa-latch-a everyone else says it wromg
Also a native Appalachian, everyone here says App-uh-lay-sha. We're in northern Appalachia though so maybe that makes a difference? 
    Southern, so probably.
        Funny how there's such a difference, but it's a huge region so you'll have this, I guess. 
It really just depends. I’ve travelled all through the mountain range, and I’ve heard it pronounced both ways equally. I do think in WV they do prefer AH over AY though.
    Any local I've met in the WV, VA, TN, KY, area have the Ah
        In NC, we call say -ah- as well
    Yeah, and people who live in WV pronounce HOUSE with a long O, and Wash like WARSH, so no one but a west virginian is gonna care anyway.
        Never met a person from WV that pronounces anything like that. My wife was born and raised there and we go back to visit and vacation.
Which part?  It spans several states...
    Sorry, should have clarified. I meant West Virginia
I was close with appa-la-chi-ah.
Not enough people realize this. 
    It even left Virginia to be a Union state
West Virginia was so pro-Union that the state came into being because they refused to secede with the rest of Virginia
    And some of the coal miners there paid with their lives for the right to unionize and demand better working conditions. The watershed moment was the [Battle of Blair Mountain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Blair_Mountain?wprov=sfla1).

And one of the possible origins of the word "redneck" is from these pro-union miners who all wore red bandanas to show their affiliation.

Don't forget the extra serving of wind
    I'm sorry. I can't hear you over the wind. 
Also a small part of Pennsylvania, according to Fallout 4.
    Pittsburgh!
        I was actually referring to the base game. According to Fallout 4, Raven Rock, and by extension the rest of the northern most part of the map, are in Pennsylvania.
            Well according to actual geography raven rock is in Pennsylvania so it makes sense. 
            Also according to real life. Raven Rock (aka "Site R") is an actual place.
I thought while it was true Mass. had it in the name, *The Commonwealth* came from the *New England Commonwealth*, the government created in 1969 from the former states of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut.

even then there's no concrete establishment of wanting to do it, unless you already know you're on a time limit like in 1, 2 however has nothing driving you towards the main story after you leave the village other than the meek attachment the player may feel towards the village.  i'd personally like to see you create your character after the major drive has been established, like you having been enslaved or conscripted by a major faction, or possibly have you as the child of an enclave officer fleeing their impending destruction at the hands of the brotherhood, or (and i hate to use old rpg tropes) have you survive the massacre of your family/village/self by a powerful group
    >even then there's no concrete establishment of wanting to do it, unless you already know you're on a time limit like in 1, 2 however has nothing driving you towards the main story after you leave the village other than the meek attachment the player may feel towards the village.  

Well besides the gameplay. The games both kinda railroad you by only showing you a town at a time in the beginning. So you will instinctually follow the main quest. Also with the way the story is, it feels more like a job. It has been assigned to you rather than assumed you desire something. 

>i'd personally like to see you create your character after the major drive has been established, like you having been enslaved or conscripted by a major faction, or possibly have you as the child of an enclave officer fleeing their impending destruction at the hands of the brotherhood, or (and i hate to use old rpg tropes) have you survive the massacre of your family/village/self by a powerful group

Eh, I think the second (and third) suggestion approach new vegas’ level of motivation and lack the strength that imo makes 1&2 stand stronger with regards to rp. However, I do like the first as it does allow for that freedom.  

The overall point is to avoid using pathos for characters motivation unless you are going to put in the leg work and actually get to know them before the journey begins. 
        yeah they all really railroad you, even vegas does even though it's more physical like in the case of vegas like 1&2, honestly i just hope the motivation is more visceral instead of attachment like the last couple games.  hell i don't care if they do like dead space and have your motivation be nothing more than to just survive running away from some big bad boogeyman 
            I wouldn’t mind that. I’m just not a huge fan of pathos for a motivation. Especially because, at least in this series, it tends to be used a little lazily. 
                you aren't going to hear me argue that they don't use it as a lazy writing mechanic
Top lad
Lol, I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not, but point taken
Feel cool and superior on a message board about a video game? 
    Don’t see how one would feel superior for bitching about not buying a certain game.
        Then why post? I’m not buying it either but don’t need to announce it. 
            Thats what I was saying to begin with... I was asking the other person why they felt the need to announce the fact that they weren’t buying the game..
                Yeah, i was answering your question. People need validation when they don’t like something others enjoy (or are anticipating). I don’t play multiplayer games but I get why “Fallout MMO” is a good idea.  There are other games I’ll play and enjoy. No need to search for validation on the internet. 
True, it is a bit. Couldn't think of much else. But that's no reason to downvote me, I mean come on.
    Not me
I can see an argument for Appalachia. I don't see how "West Virginia" has 3 in any logical pronunciation.
[deleted]
    It's called the Commonwealth because that's what the area was referred to as pre-war (ya know, like how MIT is now the [Commonwealth Institute of Technology](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/C.I.T._ruins)).

The Capital Wasteland is called that since it's around the Capital. 

And it's called the Mojave because... you get it. 

All of those regions have names rooted in their Pre-War regional names. Why shouldn't Appalachia? 
        [deleted]
            Yeah, except all the people who call the region that irl, and presumably in the fallout universe *pre-war*. The people who would have entered the vault would call the region that. They would tell their children that's what the area is called. When you leave the vault, that's what you know the region as.

It's like you're intentionally trying to not get it at this point.

p.s. nice bling 
    FILL MY MEMORY LIGHT MY WAY

p.s. thank you
Correct. It could only be played “open” or in other words the only notes that could be played are whatever the strings are tuned to. If you did something like a pentatonic scale though that gives you some decent room to work with. 
    You could play it with a slide. With slide guitar you press the slide against the strings just hard enough to change the note. You’d probably have to play by ear cause it lacks the markings. 
        You would definitely have to play by ear, and without something behind the slide to press against I'm still not convinced you'd be able to get a good sound, but I've never tried to play slide on a guitar without a fretboard so I really wouldn't know. I could be surprised at how well the slide alone is able to prevent vibration up the string and therefor result in a higher pitch. 

I've played guitar for many many years now, and completely rebuilt my strat squire with all new electronics to make a sort of franken-strat. Really want to buy a kit to build a telecaster. 
            I play cigar box guitars, on my current slide guitar there’s a 1/4 inch of space between the strings and the neck. Pressing the strings hard enough to get to the board would be uncomfortable and sound terrible. With a slide guitar it’s more like you’re bringing the fret down on the string than bringing the strings down to the fret. 
                Yeah I get the concept, I just didn't know if that would be enough to make a "seal" so to speak, but based ont he way you described it it makes a lot of sense. I actually really appreciate the simile you used. 
                    I didn't even think it was as complicated as that- when the slide touches the strings it becomes the fret. You slide around with the strings not even touching the fretboard or frets. You could have a foot of space away from the board and still play. Take this guitar sword and grab one of the many glass bottles around and you got the blues. I doubt it because, well, it's a Bethesda (aka Missed Opportunities Inc.) game but having like a bard class that plays music at settlements would be rad as fuck and is exactly why it probably won't happen.

J/K Bethesda love you guys thx 4 da memories
            Lap steel guitars are essentially fretless because the strings are raised so far up. So assume it would be a little like that. 
            you don't press down to the board with a slide, the slide acts as the fret
            You dont press against anything with a slide, the slide itself acts as the fret. It would totally work. Whether it would sound good eith a guitar like that is another matter
    They could do what Rust did, where the guitar plays a different note depending how high or low you aim the crosshairs
I enjoy your pun

    Literally just extract model file then port it to fo4 it's the same engine and I beet that did not change model structure and it also seems they are not making many new animations. All you would have to do is post to lovers lab and not Nexus/bnet. 
No, people won't, because it'll get shut down in a heart beat.

E: Imagine down voting someone because you don't like being reminded that intellectual property laws exist. 
    [removed]
        If people try to port stuff from F76 to FO4 then Nexus and Bethesda will shut it down. It's happened before with people trying to port FO3 content to FNV
            [removed]
                They'll still receive a cease and desist and legal action if it continues. 
                    *cough*a tale of two wastelands*cough*
                        *cough* that's only allowed because it requires you to own a legal copy of both FO3 and FNV and won't allow you to illegally obtain access to asset you haven't bought the rights to access by owning both games *cough*
                    [removed]
                        Imagine pirating a fucking shitty weapon model. Fuck me kid, just take the L that people won't put the effort into porting this shit
            People ported the LAER from FNV to Fo4 and it's still there.
                That wasn't a port. That was a mod, with its own original model and textures. People can mod the new F76 weapons into FO4 all they like, but they can't take the models or the textures and just port them in. 
                    This is just coming down to a battle of what terms are used. The bottom line is that LAER existed in FNV and someone made it for Fo4. Is it a "port" of something from FNV? Technically, no. Is it something from FNV that now exists in Fo4? Yes, and continually does so.
                        No, it comes down to, people won't be able to port the models and textures from F76 into FO4 because they legally can't do it. They can recreate something similar and mod it in but they can't port it. Making my initial statement correct. 
    They don't care if you port from 1 Bethesda game to another. They might now but I doubt they would get rid of mod support for 76 then also ban using any assets from it. We can see this by looking at atale of two wastelands mod that literally ports all of fallout 3 to 4.
        They do care. Because legally they have to care, if they allow one modder to redistribute their assets freely then they lose precedence to go after other people who do the same. TTW doesn't allow people to play Fallout 3 or use an of its asset for free. It requires people to own the full FO3 GOTY and the full FNV Ultimate edition. It's not redistributing assets or content for free to people who don't own the license to access that content.

I can prove to you they do care because they won't allow to Fallout 4 Capital Wasteland mod to use the FO3 audio assets. 
            Audio is a bigger deal due to voice actor contracts but heres how to get around it. Do the exact same thing they did and make a installer that extracts and adds to fo4.
                It's not a bigger deal, it's the exact same deal, it's about intellectual property and licensing and all that shit. And if someone wanted to go through that effort that'd be fine. But it still doesn't dispute my point that people won't just be "porting it to FO4" 
                    im even you really could jsut not upload it to nexus and bnet. bethesda is not gonna go threw 10000 hoops to take down a mod off some random site that gets few thousand visitors a day at most.
                        If they know about it they will, because they have to legally to have any precedent against other cases. You make one exception then other companies and people start to do the same and you have no foot to stand on in court. 
Or a vault called “Vault” then a number designating it

They *could* expand to actual quests at some point and involve the Enclave. But that's me, being wishful. 
    I guess the enclave would be neat, but what business would they have in some midwest shithole shortly after the bombs dropped?
        Greenbrier bunker? 
            Hmm fair point, not sure if it'd be relevant enough of a place but it'd be a valid enough excuse
        And West Virginia isn't in the Midwest. Part of the state is within a couple hours (depending on traffic) of Washington DC. It borders Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and regular Virginia, none of which are Midwestern states either.
&nbsp;

I don't want to sound like I'm coming down too hard on you here . Geography can be hard for some people to remember, even if they live nearby. I spent years thinking that Savannah and Augusta (Georgia) were in basically the same place. 
        Midwest?
            Sory am from punjab pakistan forgive for not knw geography 🙏
                It’s okay!! West Virginia is very East ironically the only thing separating it from the East Coast is Virginia and Pennsylvania if I remember correctly 
They said no DLC just updates, that is no must purchase DLCs like in the other games
It's gonna be a VR thing like Operation Anchorage. You find an old high-tech entertainment arcade and do some quests to get it running. Then you climb into the VR pod and everything goes dark. You hear wood creaking and the sound of horses, and your vision fades in to to the sight of snowy rocks and pine trees. You hear a voice: "Hey, you, you’re finally awake. You were trying to cross the border right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush same as us and that thief over there."
    TOOOOOOOOODD
Cincinnati/Ohio My Boy!(Hopefully). Old Cincinnati is sweet. Used to be a much bigger city with a steampunk type feel.

A few Daddy-O syringes sprinkled in there as well. I want that chem to make a come back!
The area by union station (amtrack station in downtown Portland) straight looked like it was out of fallout this summer with the forts and homes these homeless people were building 
    That's always Seattle. 
Ballard is bad too

        It’s so bad in Seattle too, I was up for a wknd like 3 weeks ago and was staying in an air bnb right next to Chinatown. Super pretty city but I walked around one morning at 7am and it allowed me to see how bad the homeless situation was (I even got grabbed from behind by a dude ) 
More than west coast again, I just wish they make the next game set near the Great Lakes. I wonder how Detroit turned out. (I don’t like the Seattle/Oregon idea, I just wanna see how detroit turned out)

And I wonder how Bethesda will treat fallout Miami in terms of lore. If they don’t acknowledge it, they better make a game of their own set around Florida and southeast. 

And I wonder if we can get a game set in Canada. Apparently the US annexed Canada in the FO universe and I’m curious how Canadian east and west coast turned out. 
    I've always thought a Fallout game in Canada would be perfect. There could be a ton of pre-war "You're an American now, act like it!" Propaganda stuff everywhere. Would be very very cool. And probably rather cold.
We're getting a very promising looking mod set in that area called Fallout Cascadia.

Dark and dusty, painted on the sky


Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye

I'm sorry. I can't hear you over the wind. 
Pittsburgh!
    I was actually referring to the base game. According to Fallout 4, Raven Rock, and by extension the rest of the northern most part of the map, are in Pennsylvania.
        Well according to actual geography raven rock is in Pennsylvania so it makes sense. 
        Also according to real life. Raven Rock (aka "Site R") is an actual place.
>even then there's no concrete establishment of wanting to do it, unless you already know you're on a time limit like in 1, 2 however has nothing driving you towards the main story after you leave the village other than the meek attachment the player may feel towards the village.  

Well besides the gameplay. The games both kinda railroad you by only showing you a town at a time in the beginning. So you will instinctually follow the main quest. Also with the way the story is, it feels more like a job. It has been assigned to you rather than assumed you desire something. 

>i'd personally like to see you create your character after the major drive has been established, like you having been enslaved or conscripted by a major faction, or possibly have you as the child of an enclave officer fleeing their impending destruction at the hands of the brotherhood, or (and i hate to use old rpg tropes) have you survive the massacre of your family/village/self by a powerful group

Eh, I think the second (and third) suggestion approach new vegas’ level of motivation and lack the strength that imo makes 1&2 stand stronger with regards to rp. However, I do like the first as it does allow for that freedom.  

The overall point is to avoid using pathos for characters motivation unless you are going to put in the leg work and actually get to know them before the journey begins. 
    yeah they all really railroad you, even vegas does even though it's more physical like in the case of vegas like 1&2, honestly i just hope the motivation is more visceral instead of attachment like the last couple games.  hell i don't care if they do like dead space and have your motivation be nothing more than to just survive running away from some big bad boogeyman 
        I wouldn’t mind that. I’m just not a huge fan of pathos for a motivation. Especially because, at least in this series, it tends to be used a little lazily. 
            you aren't going to hear me argue that they don't use it as a lazy writing mechanic
Don’t see how one would feel superior for bitching about not buying a certain game.
    Then why post? I’m not buying it either but don’t need to announce it. 
        Thats what I was saying to begin with... I was asking the other person why they felt the need to announce the fact that they weren’t buying the game..
            Yeah, i was answering your question. People need validation when they don’t like something others enjoy (or are anticipating). I don’t play multiplayer games but I get why “Fallout MMO” is a good idea.  There are other games I’ll play and enjoy. No need to search for validation on the internet. 
Not me
It's called the Commonwealth because that's what the area was referred to as pre-war (ya know, like how MIT is now the [Commonwealth Institute of Technology](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/C.I.T._ruins)).

The Capital Wasteland is called that since it's around the Capital. 

And it's called the Mojave because... you get it. 

All of those regions have names rooted in their Pre-War regional names. Why shouldn't Appalachia? 
    [deleted]
        Yeah, except all the people who call the region that irl, and presumably in the fallout universe *pre-war*. The people who would have entered the vault would call the region that. They would tell their children that's what the area is called. When you leave the vault, that's what you know the region as.

It's like you're intentionally trying to not get it at this point.

FILL MY MEMORY LIGHT MY WAY

p.s. thank you
You could play it with a slide. With slide guitar you press the slide against the strings just hard enough to change the note. You’d probably have to play by ear cause it lacks the markings. 
    You would definitely have to play by ear, and without something behind the slide to press against I'm still not convinced you'd be able to get a good sound, but I've never tried to play slide on a guitar without a fretboard so I really wouldn't know. I could be surprised at how well the slide alone is able to prevent vibration up the string and therefor result in a higher pitch. 

I've played guitar for many many years now, and completely rebuilt my strat squire with all new electronics to make a sort of franken-strat. Really want to buy a kit to build a telecaster. 
        I play cigar box guitars, on my current slide guitar there’s a 1/4 inch of space between the strings and the neck. Pressing the strings hard enough to get to the board would be uncomfortable and sound terrible. With a slide guitar it’s more like you’re bringing the fret down on the string than bringing the strings down to the fret. 
            Yeah I get the concept, I just didn't know if that would be enough to make a "seal" so to speak, but based ont he way you described it it makes a lot of sense. I actually really appreciate the simile you used. 
                I didn't even think it was as complicated as that- when the slide touches the strings it becomes the fret. You slide around with the strings not even touching the fretboard or frets. You could have a foot of space away from the board and still play. Take this guitar sword and grab one of the many glass bottles around and you got the blues. I doubt it because, well, it's a Bethesda (aka Missed Opportunities Inc.) game but having like a bard class that plays music at settlements would be rad as fuck and is exactly why it probably won't happen.

J/K Bethesda love you guys thx 4 da memories
        Lap steel guitars are essentially fretless because the strings are raised so far up. So assume it would be a little like that. 
        you don't press down to the board with a slide, the slide acts as the fret
        You dont press against anything with a slide, the slide itself acts as the fret. It would totally work. Whether it would sound good eith a guitar like that is another matter
They could do what Rust did, where the guitar plays a different note depending how high or low you aim the crosshairs
Literally just extract model file then port it to fo4 it's the same engine and I beet that did not change model structure and it also seems they are not making many new animations. All you would have to do is post to lovers lab and not Nexus/bnet. 
[removed]
    If people try to port stuff from F76 to FO4 then Nexus and Bethesda will shut it down. It's happened before with people trying to port FO3 content to FNV
        [removed]
            They'll still receive a cease and desist and legal action if it continues. 
                *cough*a tale of two wastelands*cough*
                    *cough* that's only allowed because it requires you to own a legal copy of both FO3 and FNV and won't allow you to illegally obtain access to asset you haven't bought the rights to access by owning both games *cough*
                [removed]
                    Imagine pirating a fucking shitty weapon model. Fuck me kid, just take the L that people won't put the effort into porting this shit
        People ported the LAER from FNV to Fo4 and it's still there.
            That wasn't a port. That was a mod, with its own original model and textures. People can mod the new F76 weapons into FO4 all they like, but they can't take the models or the textures and just port them in. 
                This is just coming down to a battle of what terms are used. The bottom line is that LAER existed in FNV and someone made it for Fo4. Is it a "port" of something from FNV? Technically, no. Is it something from FNV that now exists in Fo4? Yes, and continually does so.
                    No, it comes down to, people won't be able to port the models and textures from F76 into FO4 because they legally can't do it. They can recreate something similar and mod it in but they can't port it. Making my initial statement correct. 
They don't care if you port from 1 Bethesda game to another. They might now but I doubt they would get rid of mod support for 76 then also ban using any assets from it. We can see this by looking at atale of two wastelands mod that literally ports all of fallout 3 to 4.
    They do care. Because legally they have to care, if they allow one modder to redistribute their assets freely then they lose precedence to go after other people who do the same. TTW doesn't allow people to play Fallout 3 or use an of its asset for free. It requires people to own the full FO3 GOTY and the full FNV Ultimate edition. It's not redistributing assets or content for free to people who don't own the license to access that content.

I can prove to you they do care because they won't allow to Fallout 4 Capital Wasteland mod to use the FO3 audio assets. 
        Audio is a bigger deal due to voice actor contracts but heres how to get around it. Do the exact same thing they did and make a installer that extracts and adds to fo4.
            It's not a bigger deal, it's the exact same deal, it's about intellectual property and licensing and all that shit. And if someone wanted to go through that effort that'd be fine. But it still doesn't dispute my point that people won't just be "porting it to FO4" 
                im even you really could jsut not upload it to nexus and bnet. bethesda is not gonna go threw 10000 hoops to take down a mod off some random site that gets few thousand visitors a day at most.
                    If they know about it they will, because they have to legally to have any precedent against other cases. You make one exception then other companies and people start to do the same and you have no foot to stand on in court. 
I guess the enclave would be neat, but what business would they have in some midwest shithole shortly after the bombs dropped?
    Greenbrier bunker? 
        Hmm fair point, not sure if it'd be relevant enough of a place but it'd be a valid enough excuse
    And West Virginia isn't in the Midwest. Part of the state is within a couple hours (depending on traffic) of Washington DC. It borders Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and regular Virginia, none of which are Midwestern states either.
&nbsp;

I don't want to sound like I'm coming down too hard on you here . Geography can be hard for some people to remember, even if they live nearby. I spent years thinking that Savannah and Augusta (Georgia) were in basically the same place. 
    Midwest?
        Sory am from punjab pakistan forgive for not knw geography 🙏
            It’s okay!! West Virginia is very East ironically the only thing separating it from the East Coast is Virginia and Pennsylvania if I remember correctly 
TOOOOOOOOODD
That's always Seattle. 
Ballard is bad too

    It’s so bad in Seattle too, I was up for a wknd like 3 weeks ago and was staying in an air bnb right next to Chinatown. Super pretty city but I walked around one morning at 7am and it allowed me to see how bad the homeless situation was (I even got grabbed from behind by a dude ) 
I've always thought a Fallout game in Canada would be perfect. There could be a ton of pre-war "You're an American now, act like it!" Propaganda stuff everywhere. Would be very very cool. And probably rather cold.

    Oh! I thought you were making a reference to an [episode](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Girl_Who_Waited?wprov=sfla1) of Doctor Who. It takes place on a planet whose name sounds like someone reading the word "Appalachia" out loud for the first time. 
"yeah theyah vawlt dwellah, we been gettin hit by these fahkin yuge lobstahs, and i don't think theyall go inna soup, if you know what im sayin" 
    I don't, sorry.
        Well a humph and a discontented grumble to you too cranky
            Haha. Wasn't trying to be cranky, I was on board until the second comma then I didn't understand what they were getting at. 
                I just read the comment and now I'm confused at what that last sentence that dude said was about too... 
                    See! I'm not an ass, just a confused non-New Englander.
East Tennessee here and that’s exactly right.
    Going to Gatlinburg for New Years! If I hear AppaLAYchan while I'm there, 2019 will be ruined. 
        Don't worry most in Gatlinburg say it correctly the damn tourist on the other hands not so much. SWVA here. They better say some of the town names correctly if they are featured as well
This is the only correct way right here^^^
That's wrong
My wife was born and raised in WV and says Apple-ay-she-uh. All of her friends and everyone I've met in WV either says it that way, or with a hard ch like Apple-ay-chia.
    Fascinating, I'm from Eastern TN / Western NC and the only people I've ever heard say "Appalayshia" were visitors. Must be more region-specific than I thought. 
As a native of these mountains it's pronounced Appa-latch-a everyone else says it wromg
Funny how there's such a difference, but it's a huge region so you'll have this, I guess. 
In NC, we call say -ah- as well
Never met a person from WV that pronounces anything like that. My wife was born and raised there and we go back to visit and vacation.
I don't want Fop, goddammit! I'm a Dapper Dan man!
I would post a Rick and Morty gif for this if I could figure it out but, alcohol.

Yeah I get the concept, I just didn't know if that would be enough to make a "seal" so to speak, but based ont he way you described it it makes a lot of sense. I actually really appreciate the simile you used. 
    I didn't even think it was as complicated as that- when the slide touches the strings it becomes the fret. You slide around with the strings not even touching the fretboard or frets. You could have a foot of space away from the board and still play. Take this guitar sword and grab one of the many glass bottles around and you got the blues. I doubt it because, well, it's a Bethesda (aka Missed Opportunities Inc.) game but having like a bard class that plays music at settlements would be rad as fuck and is exactly why it probably won't happen.

J/K Bethesda love you guys thx 4 da memories
They'll still receive a cease and desist and legal action if it continues. 
    *cough*a tale of two wastelands*cough*
        *cough* that's only allowed because it requires you to own a legal copy of both FO3 and FNV and won't allow you to illegally obtain access to asset you haven't bought the rights to access by owning both games *cough*

        Imagine pirating a fucking shitty weapon model. Fuck me kid, just take the L that people won't put the effort into porting this shit
That wasn't a port. That was a mod, with its own original model and textures. People can mod the new F76 weapons into FO4 all they like, but they can't take the models or the textures and just port them in. 
    This is just coming down to a battle of what terms are used. The bottom line is that LAER existed in FNV and someone made it for Fo4. Is it a "port" of something from FNV? Technically, no. Is it something from FNV that now exists in Fo4? Yes, and continually does so.
        No, it comes down to, people won't be able to port the models and textures from F76 into FO4 because they legally can't do it. They can recreate something similar and mod it in but they can't port it. Making my initial statement correct. 
It's not a bigger deal, it's the exact same deal, it's about intellectual property and licensing and all that shit. And if someone wanted to go through that effort that'd be fine. But it still doesn't dispute my point that people won't just be "porting it to FO4" 
    im even you really could jsut not upload it to nexus and bnet. bethesda is not gonna go threw 10000 hoops to take down a mod off some random site that gets few thousand visitors a day at most.
        If they know about it they will, because they have to legally to have any precedent against other cases. You make one exception then other companies and people start to do the same and you have no foot to stand on in court. 
It’s okay!! West Virginia is very East ironically the only thing separating it from the East Coast is Virginia and Pennsylvania if I remember correctly 
Haha. Wasn't trying to be cranky, I was on board until the second comma then I didn't understand what they were getting at. 
    I just read the comment and now I'm confused at what that last sentence that dude said was about too... 
        See! I'm not an ass, just a confused non-New Englander.
Muchas gracias
