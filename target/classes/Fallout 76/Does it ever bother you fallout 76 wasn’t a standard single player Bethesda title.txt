[[Does it ever bother you fallout 76 wasn’t a standard single player Bethesda title]]


76 had such a good setting for a fallout game and so many cool creatures, and I feel like it could have been one of the best fallouts if it wasn’t multiplayer, I think about it often


I think it would have been way better if it was single-player by default with the option to party up with friends instead of being an always multi-player type game. I played for roughly a month and just couldn't get past it. Put the game down for a couple years, picked it up for half a day, disliked it more, and have never touched  it again.
    This is what I always wanted out of it. I played it a fair bit but wasn't overly crazy about the online multiplayer lobby idea. I've always just wanted a co-op fallout game to play with friends, not with a bunch of strangers online. Personally speaking, Fallout 76 would have been better as a single player or co-op game. I still hope they make a co-op Fallout game some time. Building bases with friends, exploring the wastes, etc. While you can build with friends, nothing outside of camps is saved, taking away from wanting to build anything elaborate or interesting.
        If they would have made it like borderlands co-op then it'd have been better 
            Yeah, that's pretty well as ideal of way to do it as I could think of. It does stink having the progress tied to the host sometimes, but having a good group of friends to screw around with makes it worth it, at least for a playthrough or two.
        I have never really interacted with people in 76 apart from friends or exploring peoples’ neat camp builds. The events draw other players but i have only been griefed once and it amounted to nothing. By saving blueprints or partial blueprints you can pretty much deploy your multiple camps, shelter, etc. quite easily without much cost. I mostly just jump in with my group of friends, we pop up our camps, and never have to worry about anyone else.  Sometimes we have funny moments of “look at those two guys on the roof shooting raiders. Lol anyways…” I dont so much see it as a lobby situation as much as a trade off. I cant save and reload, but if i screw up i can jump out of the world until a friend can get there to help:) i think the mechanics are more towards a world of cooperative strangers. The Casual Party feature lets you fast travel and get XP just because some random person is doing something somewhere. It is like the random encounters. Obviously i would love a fallout that worked like Borderlands but with how rough this game was released im not holding my breath:/
        > I still hope they make a co-op Fallout game some time. Building bases with friends, exploring the wastes, etc. While you can build with friends, nothing outside of camps is saved, taking away from wanting to build anything elaborate or interesting.

Well, god damn, you got me hooked.
        It sort of is. If you have a (senses unease from others) Fallout 1st Sub, you can have that private world, and the ability to play with just a small group of friends (up to 7 other friends in world). And while I do agree that CAMP building could do with a lot more life than it currently has (at the moment they can only have 1 Camp Ally, so they do feel lifeless), I've seen some downright amazing 'settlements' done by groups of friends who build their CAMPS together one next to the other, which makes them look an awful lot like proper settlements. So it's entirely co-op playable with a small group of friends.
            Most of the time when I played it was a great experience overall but there were some things that made it feel off. Losing progress on daily type quests if you logged out without completing them, losing progress on workshop bases, and how some of the co-op quests didn't really work as a co-op experience. 

I remember playing the beta with a couple friends and we had a blast working on a workshop base together only for us to lose all progress once you log out. Camps have come a long way and there is a lot you can do in a Camp, but overall the progression just felt strange with some elements in the game as it was designed. 

I don't have high hopes but that's okay. I had a lot of fun in 76 when I played it and at some point may return. I don't regret the time I spent with the game even with its flaws.
            >If you have a (senses unease from others) Fallout 1st Sub

You shouldn't have to buy something else on top of buying the game to get something that Beth could have easily implemented.
        Yeah thats pretty much exactly my view point. I really like the world, the mobs, the gameplay and whatnot, but I just couldn't get past it being an open lobby type thing. Still bums me out lol
    Any time someone makes a game that could be either single player or multi player, there's really only two ways to work out the logistics of how many players you're accommodating. If it's single player, then the world has a narrative focused around the player and their advancements - including permanent changes to the world and its inhabitants - and drop-in multi player usually just means someone else gets to help them shape that narrative cooperatively. See Baldur's Gate 3 for a recent example; even if you have a party of four, one is still the "host" and the main character for major events/cutscenes. Conversely, if you design an open world multi player game, then every player must have an opportunity to engage with each element of the content at possibly any time, and so you must largely retain a static, unchanging world where at best, people can visit quests/events sort of like amusement park attractions: a party goes into the "ride", fights the bad guys, slays the evil boss, and then when they leave, all the props reset for the next group. Defeated the ultimate evil that was plaguing the land, and thus saved all of mankind? Well another paying customer has to be able to do that after you, so your efforts mean nothing; the instance resets and the big bad is right back on his throne.

I have always had precisely zero interest in engaging with the latter style of play, for precisely the reason that it's all just so hollow and unrewarding; there's no purpose in playing the game except just to be there with other people. You can never tell a developing story where players have impact, because if you let one person change the world then someone else misses out. The closest you can get is when the developers do expansions/updates that finally, eventually walk the world narrative forward for everyone at the same time. Even then, it can often lower engagement if people joining the game later are told, "Oh yeah, seasons 1 and 2 were great but season 3 is kinda 'meh' now. Shame you'll never be able to go back and play any of those missions."

If you're going to make a multiplayer game, then I'd argue one should package the narrative such that it can be resolved in the span of a typical a multiplayer session. Everyday shooters like CoD or even Quake do this plainly by having little or no story (short term objectives at best, usually) and just being a deathmatch, while co-op titles like Left 4 Dead set a great standard for telling "short stories" where you can just drop in with 3 friends and go, and it's all over in 45-90 minutes. But in my opinion, RPGs are a dogshit fit for massive online multiplayer because it doesn't matter how much you develop your character if they can never actually make a difference in the narrative. It all just becomes "costumes" of various colors going on the same "rides".

I do make an exception for PvP focused RPGs because in those the way you build your character determines how well you fight against others, but even then the story is vestigial to the PvP gameplay; you could just attach a leveling/progression system to a session-based shooter like L4D or CoD and that would still work, without trying to shoehorn in never-progressing story elements.

That's how I perceive it, at least. Sorry for the novel, and thanks for reading.
        How about best of both worlds? A single player based game where people can pop in and out, plus a hub area with multiplayer content where you can take your character. Like GTA online-ish except they would share the same character.
        You described the problem with multiplayer games quite expertly.   


I think the inherent problem with a massively multiplayer focused game is that they make use of MMO conventions... most of which are terrible mechanics that MMOs should never have done in the first place. Various  mechanics designed to make it take an absurd amount of time to do things. Enemies that respawn within seconds. Slow movement designed to make it take much longer than necessary or realistic to get from one place to the next. Microtransactions designed to alleviate the grind at the cost of sweet sweet green. etc.  


The point of multiplayer has always been not to provide players more content, but to have the players themselves provide the content. If you're running around yakking with your friends while taking on some boss, you're less likely to notice or care that there's next to no real story taking place. Singleplayer games have to have content in place for the player, but with multiplayer the player you're fighting with or alongside can just... be the content. More accurately, there's zero reason for the devs not to provide the content in a multiplayer game, but why bother when the players will do all the work for them?  


It's shallow and pointless.
        Thanks for typing it. That's pretty insightful, and makes tremendous sense.
        This is a great way to put it, and I completely agree. I think borderlands handles multiplayer very well where when someone hops into your game, they up the difficulty/level of enemies to compensate, but otherwise the gameplay remains largely unchanged, and it's more that first scenario where the host is advancing a story and changing the world. I haven't played baldurs gate, but it looks great, and knowing it's that first type as well definitely seals the deal for me as I want to play that with my gf. 

I'm all in on that first type, and the way you explained the second type is probably why I've never really liked those games. It all feels hollow and nothing ever really changes.
            My fiancée and I have been going through BG3 exclusively in co-op mode, and it’s been an amazing time. Highly recommended, even if it’s a bit daunting using all the fine details with a controller (dual keyboard and mouse isn’t possible on split screen mode).
        There is another POSSIBLE approach, but it's expensive and technically complex.  Break the game into major chapters.  Give the story a couple major inflection points, and have a cluster of game servers running for each stage of the story progression.  In FO75, I'd have 2 sets of servers.  One before you deal with the scorched queen and one for after.
        I think the option for private servers would have been nice, but I don't know how feasible it would be for a game of this scope. And it still would not solve the problems you pointed out with how single boss fights and story progression are handled. One really nice thing about most fallout games is the environmental story telling. I think maybe they could have leaned a lot more heavily into that to find some kind of middle ground with terminals, notes, etc that can still be found by everyone playing in that game instance without having to rely on them having to all be on at the same time. But then again you'd have to miss out on creating meaningful encounters or, as you said, have them watered down with endless respawns. I hadn't thought about a lot of the issues you pointed out with regards to creating a multi-player rpg, so it does give me a good perspective. Thanks for the information!
        The analysis of multiplayer vs massive multiplayer is spot on, but I disagree about the player not having impacts and being rewarded. Unlocks, leveling up, better gear, etc. can all be tied to characters and handed out as rewards. They're the usual RPG staples.

As for impacts, it's not going to be on a massive scale, but between characters and specifics? Absolutely. The use of instances, interior environments that are exclusive to the player/party, means simultaneous a d opposing choices can be made on individual scales.

The repetition also provides a safety net that's really needed when open ended RPGs become multiplayer. Imagine if Fallout 4 had multiplayer crowbarred into it. You're going to talk to Desdamona and join the Railroad when your buddy thinks it would be funny to open fire. Well, guess that questline is gone forever. ...Oops!

Even the big stuff from single player games are eventually flattened by the series itself. The Vault Dweller? Open in Fallout, flattened by Fallout 2. The Lone Wanderer? Open in Fallout 3, flattened by Fallout 4. All that's fluid turns solid eventually.
        They could add a whole single player option and maybe even mod support while keeping the open world multiplayer from the second scenario as a base ‘get on and piss away a few hours after work or school or cause you’re bored” but also have a game mode that is more driven towards a single person, or a main character in a group of people on a more story driven, still open world style similar to the other fallout games, just with the option of playing it multiplayer. So many other games use the single main character multiplayer party style and it has been around for a long time, so I would’ve thought that would’ve been the choice for 76
        Loved the rant, so don't apologise. 😃


Ironically, you just described Nuclear Winter in option 2 mechanics wise. And Bethesda removed that option (much to the disappointment of many). Because the chimera that is 76 is the lowest common denominator of both worlds. And somehow makes them a considerable amount of money.
    I put over 1k hours into 76 and played solo the entire time and enjoyed it. I honestly had a great time and didn't know a single friend that played.

Point is it can be very fun single player. I did every single mission solo.
        I may have go get on and give it another go. I honestly can't say what about the open lobby style turned me away from it, I just had a hard time getting into real good because of it.
            So there's a bunch of people coming back like right now, and are overjoyed in love with it.

Enter in the last time you played and it should show you everything you missed and what's new. 

I don't know if you have an Xbox or if your PC is pretty good, but Xbox Gamepass has the whole fallout series. I'm pretty sure you can get two weeks for $1.
                I have it for Xbox, but have gotten to where I primarily play everything on PC over the past year. Thanks for the link. I'm gonna check it out again and see if I can get into it this time.
    The worst part for me is that they **put infinite material storage space behind a fucking monthly subscription paywall**

As a loot hoarder, the moment I saw that it killed my desire to play and I immediately stopped
        Once you get a feel for what you're doing and what you actually need it's really not that bad. I can't remember the last time I've actually had to go out and grind materials and I have several hundred hours in the game.
            As a self-confessed hoarder this was tough to learn for F76, but worth it.

I realised that if I capped myself to holding no more than about 100 of each resource I had more than enough to build anything, anytime.  Slight exception for ammo crafting materials, but if I needed to build a new CAMP, not a problem.

And as you say, you quickly learn where to go to replenish if you run low.

Selling spare crafting materials in my personal vendor also provided a steady income.
        Yeah, that was a big factor for me. I enjoy hoarding materials so that when I end up going full tilt on building a base or something I don't have to go hunting for stuff every 5 minutes.
    Yeah I mean. I don't know about you but when I was a kid saying "I wish oblivion/fallout 3/Skyrim was multiplayer" I meant Borderlands style, not World of Warcraft style.
    I was hoping it would be like Left 4 Dead, where if you want to play on your own, you can have up to 3 AI companions you can use, or up to 3 friends can join in and do co-op missions, or a mix of both. Limiting the number of other players would allow much more polished multiplayer missions that allow everyone to participate, where objectives could rely on different people being in different locations at the same time (ie hacking multiple computers simultaneously, ambushes, etc).
    I've been a mad Fallout fan before New Vegas was announced, and comments like yours are why I have no regrets in even trying 76.
    Same I quit and just couldn't get into it again
    Being able to use vats. 

Actually just the whole fallout 4 engine then changing when you go online for a new online mode that can just play the whole campaign
    Agree, I picked it up on sale and thought it was fine, but I just couldn't get into it. And most of the other players I ran into were either super high levels playing with their friends, so no real threat or interest to me or griefers who'd kill me, loot my body for the like 2 tin cans and rotten fruit in my inventory, who'd then hunt me down at my respawn to do the same to me again because how dare I have "nothing of value in my inventory" when I had only just started the game. -\_-
Fallout Appalachia has a better ring to it and would've been a better experience with an improved QOL FO4.
People complain about multiplayer but people rarely bother me. It’s rare to bump into someone unless you’re looking for them.
    F76 is a single player game within a multiplayer world.

It's like Runescape/OSRS or it's sister game ESO.

The game might be played on a multiplayer server, but unless you physically go seeking multiplayer content you can realistically play the entire game, main story line, Setters/Raiders Quests, BOS quests and even solo each expedition without requiring a single person.

You can make the argument then why does it have to be a game, and to that the game is better for it. F76 has the best community I've ever seen for an online game. There are so few toxic players it's shocking.
        Because it isn't a PvP centric game
    I bumped into someone being a moron before I even got out of my own vault. I get that for most people it’s not a big deal, but I really wish you could just play it offline.
No, because the game is basically a single player as it is. The only times I really run into other players are when I step out of Vault 76 or when I’m looking for group activities. 

The other players in every world I’ve played have usually all scattered once it loads.
    I feel like I’m going crazy. There’s been a handful of these posts lately. I can’t recall the game requiring any multiplayer at all, whatsoever.
        The only multiplayer it really requires is a constant connection to a server , other than that it can be treated and played like any other SP Fallout game . 

I feel like most of the people who make these posts havent really ever bothered with the game to begin with and give opinions based of what they heard 5 years ago
            To some extent, I'm the person you're describing.  I'm not hanging onto any old opinions of the game, but knowing that the server connection is required feels dirty, kind of like where Blizzard took the Diablo series.  Even if I never encounter another soul, knowing that I'm not truly alone is (admittely, irrationally) kind of annoying.

That said, I do intend to play the game one of these days, and I expect I'll thoroughly enjoy it, but I've also been trying to vote with my dollars to some extent by putting it off this long.
                I avoided it at launch but picked it up about a year later for £6.  I then got a good 600+ hours out of it, with most of that time playing essentially solo, just in an online world with other players.

There are some things you adapt your playstyle for - you can't hoard everything you ever found being the hardest for me - but as far as other player interaction it was often only seeing other people in well travelled areas like merchants or big world events.
All things considered I play the game as a single player entry and I’ve had a great time
    Came here to say this! I have played FO76 from beginning to end solo and I loved it!

That being said, it did always feel like I couldn’t make a significant impact on the world (like.. I made a vaccine against scorched and they’re still everywhere. I killed the scorchbeast queen and the beasts are still around. Stuff like that is the compromise that a game like this has to make to work for every player, I guess.
Can’t leave a huge crater on the map like in FO3 or FO4, if someone else wants to explore the place that used to be there.

But that’s really only a minor complaint for me, as you still change things in the world. The changes are just not as impactful.
I would have preferred FO76 as a single player offline too with the online option available.

With that being said:

1. I found the generosity of more experienced players random which was great.
2. I would hope someone or Bethesda releases a single player version in future but that is a big ask.
3. I had to feel like a cunning fox to finish the game online with someone else in the I Am Become Death mission. The launching of the missile though felt warm and fuzzy.
4. I am keeping the game as a collector but it is very risky due to it being totally online.
    >I would hope someone or Bethesda releases a single player version in future but that is a big ask.

Yeah, a big ask for sure. They'd have to completely revamp the game from the ground up to do that. Even if someday they released a means to play 76 without requiring a server connection at all, the game is still built to be an multiplayer game and thus isn't designed for a singleplayer experience. The only way a single player version could work is by redesigning the game, and at that point they'd probably just make a new singleplayer Fallout instead.
Yes. But it's relatively low on the list.
Yes. Because I won't play it, and think it could have been fun to.
No, you can play it like a single player if you want, but the online element is what gives the game a lot of its charm
    I tried to play it as single player but the third time I had to move my house I was done.
        You don’t have to move your house, if someone else is in your CAMP spot, you can just switch to a different CAMP, or switch servers

It’s not usually a problem unless you pick one of the more popular spots, like the ones near the Whitespring
        That issue has been fixed for years
            Seems like most of the complaints are back in year 1 when it was very rough and lacking lots of content; it's much better now. Seriously impressed at all the QOL they put into fixing the little things.
            I didn't play the game at all until a few months ago.
                If that's the case, then you didn't HAVE to move your house, the game notifies you that your camp can't be placed on that world due to another players camp being there, and you can simply leave that server and join one where your camp can be placed
                    Logging in and out of servers is so much fun/  

No thanks.
                        Oh no, waiting a whole minute! Literally unplayable.
                            Why is it so important to defend the game to me? 

Am I not allowed to dislike 76?
                                You are. You're just wrong about some of the game's mechanics.
                                    >You are.

It would very much seem otherwise.
        You don't HAVE to move your home though. Nobody forced you to move it ...
            Yes but the alternative is logging out and then hoping that when I log back in the spot is available.  No thanks.
                You’re not going to play it I get that, but each account starts with two CAMP slots, typically what people do is build up both, then if one is blocked they can just deploy the second

I have a few CAMPs in popular spots, and never once had both blocked on the same server. 

Doing this takes just a few seconds on a bad day, and doesn’t interrupt the flow of the game at all

This information isn’t so much for you because it’s obvious you’re invested in not playing the game, but for anyone reading and thinking this might somehow be a barrier to playing or enjoying the game, when in fact for most people it’s a complete non issue
I enjoy it as it is but also see it as a building block to future games. Look at how much lore is being created in the game. Companies who have their products, their shop styles, their specific robot servers, billboards and adverts on the radio... All available to just paste into the next game. Obviously graphics will be updated by then, but the design work is done and much of the audio can simply be dragged and dropped.

Look at the radio plays they've created and can transfer over, alongside making new ones in the same family of shows. All of those Scoreboard shows and adverts as well, plus the holotape cryptid stories. The radio is going to be absolutely packed with content in the next game just from transferring all the adverts and plays over from these things.

Then there's all the new creatures plus those returning from pre-Bethesda Fallout games. These now have the way they work in those worlds figured out and base rigs and actions sorted. And new areas being added via Expeditions are helping to flesh out more of the world, with factions and interesting environments and new creatures.

It all adds up to a Build A Fallout kit that they can use to make Fallout 5 absolutely jam-packed with content in a world that feels steeped in history and the effects of the bombs/fall of civilisation.
When Bethesda saw how much money ESO's cash shop made, they immediately said, "Let's make one for Fallout." Not, Appalachia would be a great Fallout, not Let's do an earlier Fallout in the timeline, not even let's do a multiplayer Fallout. Everything after "Let's make a Fallout cash shop" was "How can we make this as fast, easy, and cheaply as possible." And that is what bothers me most.
    Bingo. Also, they were trying to quickly build their portfolio so Microsoft would buy them. And what better way to inflate your value than to have more recurring-spending types of games?
    Zenimax made that decision lol.
        I guess Microsoft can be your scapegoat now?
            Being factually accurate is not scapegoating.
                So yea, you will be blaming Microsoft for all the bad decisions and praising Bethesda for all the success in your "Well... Ackually," replies.  

Never mind that the entire structure from capital to creatives is colloquially known as Bethesda, but you think being pedantic will mean that people don't know that the blame still falls on the group as a whole.  

I suppose the distinction makes you feel safer that the next single-player Bethesda game will be stunningly GOAT... said everyone before Starfield launched.
                    I have been criticizing Bethesda directly since the game released. I was just complaining about the lack of dungeons in Starfield last week. You are talking out of your ass making strawman arguments.
Like most everyone else, I wish it was a full single player experience also but I still had a great time with it. I played a couple years after release so it had some decent content.

You can play most of the game single player and it was fun jumping into raids with others if you wanted to switch things up a bit. I personally think it’s the best fallout map to explore. 

The only thing I really miss from that game was searching for the perfect campsite and building out my base. It was fun randomly finding peoples campsites and hanging out with them or have them randomly stumble into yours. I miss sitting on my porch overlooking a huge part of Appalachia.
yes. Very much. Especially since theres a subscription for single player mode
    Yep. A subscription for a singleplayer mode that should be the default in the first place.
        I got fo76 for like 5 bucks, played it maybe once. good map, but I'd prefer (as dumb as it sounds) the gamebryo engine over whatever amalgam of the creation engine it uses. Better combat and such.
All the time
On paper Fallout 76 offered the series something it needed more than another single player masterpiece. The series is filled with excellent single player games, but between Starfield and Elder Scrolls 6 the next mainline Fallout game is going to be a while off. If 76 was just a single player spin off game from 4, we would get 76, some DLC and patches, and then absolutely nothing new for the Fallout IP for years. Giving Fallout the Elder Scrolls Online treatment with a live service multiplayer game would push the Fallout series into a new genre and allow Bethesda to drip feed new Fallout content for many years to come. The execution may have been botched heavily, but on paper it would have been a healthier move for the series than a quick spin off game and nothing but fanmade mods for over a decade or more

A problem that could be easily solved by Bethesda simply... hiring more people and forming studios specifically to handle creating the games for each IP at the same time. Thus releasing a new entry in each series every 2-3 years instead of somewhere in the area of 7-8.
No, not at all.
Not anymore than it bothered me that ESO wasn't a standard elder scrolls single player game.
I see a lot of comments about how it’s basically single player… but like then why not just let us download it and play it alone already
every waking minute actually.

I would play it, the exact second they implement an offline mode
Yes, but it is because of one specific reason.

I played it for a while and I really enjoyed it.  My issue though is Fallout 1st.

If you are not familiar with it, it is the subscription for the game.  It allows you to make a private server, gives you swag (like decor for your camps), and unlimited junk storage (among other things).

As a terrible hoarder I am inclined to keep everything that I find and I got used to just storing all the stuff that I picked up.

Without the unlimited junk, I don’t have any interest in playing the game.  Even with the junk storage by the time that I finished playing, I spent too much time fiddling with my inventory.  

I had no issue with other players.   I thought that it was fun having the option to party up and do events with other people. The junk storage issue is a dealbreaker for me though personally.
    Create a problem, and sell the solution. Scummy af
        For sure.
Honestly 76 is the only online game where I’ve had consistent friendly interactions so I’m fine with it. Also when I launched my first nuke, the entire lobby showed up to take on the queen and it was one of my favorite moments in gaming to date
Not really, I think a lot of people (myself included) needed multiplayer fallout experience to explore the world with friends, meet other people from time to time and just have fun together. And it's not like it restricts you in any way if you want to play it alone :)  

That said I really hope Fo5 will have just as big and diverse world as Fo76. After seeing so many vast unique biomes and areas Fo4's map feels so tiny lol
I remember when 76 was announced pre E3 there were theories that this was a secret spinoff made by another studio. Technically true however people were imagining 76 was gonna be to fallout 4 what new Vegas was to fallout 3.
    It is partly true, in the sense that another studio helped adding multiplayer capability to the engine, but most of Fallout 4's team did work on 76 until launch, and the creative direction was from there, so it was a different type of project than Fallout: New Vegas or Elder Scrolls Online in any case. [This article](https://kotaku.com/sources-fallout-76-is-an-online-survival-rpg-1826425333) that was posted within a day of the initial announcement was fairly accurate, but many other rumors were circulating until the reveal at E3, a lot of people probably hoped more for a single player spin-off, or one with an optional co-op mode.
I would have been extremely happy with even just a fallout 4 reskin essentially with the new Appalachia map, creatures, and quests/factions. Some people are mentioning that the game can be played single player at this point but the fact that its an online game eliminates all the mods that make bethesda games special.
Nah. I think it’s best that Bethesda take some time and figure out what the next Fallout game will be. Hopefully that way they can make some course correction from 4, and all the critique lately regarding their outdated design methods. The latter is very much wishful thinking on my part, however. 
At first I was supper bummed but it’s turned into a really solid open world multiplayer game.
The co-op Fallout is fun.  Co-op Fallout 4 would be better.  The live-service grind-fest it has become is not.
It could have been great if it wasn't fallout 4 mashed into an mmo and held together with duct tape and Elmer's glue
Yes. The gameplay suffers as a result of resources being allocated to making it an online multiplayer game. I think what would have been a lot better would be to make a co-op Fallout game where you can invite a friend to join you in your single player campaign as your companion. Maybe they could even import their character into your game…
Yes. Stupid online games
Yea because I won't play it. Now that it's apparently a good game it would be nice if it was single player with modding support.
Yup. I was incredibly hyped when I saw the trailer for the concept, then they went into detail on what the game actually pertained.

&#x200B;

Hype deflated so fast.
I would've preferred a Co-op Fallout
Just about everything about that game bothers me.
Yes. Next question.
If we could've actually interacted with the Order of Mysteries, the Freestaters, the Enclave, et cetera then sure. I really liked the Order of Mysteries questline. The ending of it, however, were left me with no satisfaction whatsoever. I can't kill and butcher the raiders because they're dead already. At least  as far as the Cuttthroats are concerned. I do take solace in the fact that Thorpe ended up a scorched.  Overall Fallout 76 definitely could've been better as a single player game.
Always online games that aren't PvP focused are a turn off for me.
Yeah even though I enjoy 76 and did prior to Wastelanders, I still think it's such a massive shame that Bethesda's arguably best world they've ever created for a Fallout/TES game was wasted on an online title.  
The game has stunning locale design, improved textures & lighting on FO4, has a great number of enemies, variants and decent factions. The weapons are mostly the same, but also has some fun additions to the game, alongside variants again, and armor is also a plus too.

The locations in-world are interesting and they used really well thought our environmental storytelling, and the slow movement between zones on the world map is done really well. One minute you're in a beautiful forest, next minute said forest is slowly disappearing into a bog or ashpit etc.
All I wanted was a fallout game with classic drop in drop out co-op. Surviving the wastes with a friend would’ve been so cool in a single player fallout
    but they couldn’t sell micro transactions that way.
        Yeah they are pretty greedy. They could always just do more creation club or fallout 1st type stuff, but that probably wouldn’t be enough for them
YES!!!!! OF COURSE YES!!!!
My biggest gripe is the mmo part. 1000lv to grind with stuff and bullet sponge enemies.

In other Fallout games, it's satisfying when you reach a point where you one shot strong enemies.
Yes. I liked a lot about the game but overall could not get past the grindy, MMO-like aspects of it. And of course, vats not stopping time, and the inability to pause in general turned me off to it.
Yes, it did. That’s why I didn’t buy it.
All the time. Some people don’t have the ability to play something they can’t simply pause because of real world obligations. I’d love to explore West Virginia without a server and have pause functionality.
Every day
Literally the moment it was announced, yes. It was a terrible idea from the outset to make it a multiplayer game. The lack of singleplayer content, being buggy even for a Bethesda game, and then sticking in a store to the game was just the nail in the coffin.   


Despite it's so called "improvements" (read: doing what should've been done in the first place) 76 will always be the moment I gave up on Bethesda. Other crap they've done like Horse Armor and Paid Mods among other things were bad enough, but Fallout 76 was the straw that broke the camel's back for me. I will never trust Bethesda again after that game.
As someone who loves fallout and hates multiplayer games:  YES.
Every time I think about 76, yes.  If they really wanted multiplayer they should have stopped at coop.  I’d love to join a friends world as a companion.
Personally i haven't recovered yet.
To me it was a trash game (and still is) from the start because it's multiplayer.

Hard pass, no money from me, and god know how much i spend and the other title.
Fallout 1: where the geck? 

Fallout 2: where's the water chip

Fallout 3: where's my dad? 

Fallout 4: where's my son?

Fallout new Vegas: where's the dude in the checker suit?

Fallout 76: where's my refund?
Eh, I’ve grown over it TBH. Now I just enjoy it for what it is, even if it is a mess
I had an awesome 200 hour single player experience with it. The map is stunning and so awesome, by far the best in the whole series.
    1k hours here. Agreed. By far my favorite - and all played single player.
I'm still waiting for them to turn it into a single player game.  Shouldn't be that hard should it?
    They could probably allow it to work offline pretty easily, but the game was still designed to be a multiplayer game. Thus they'd have to remake 76 from the ground up to really turn it into a singleplayer game.
Spin-offs aren’t a bad thing. Different isn’t a bad thing.
All the time. I haven’t played it because I refuse to play for an online service on console that 1) used to be free and 2) that I’ll use infrequently for one or maybe 2 games. This is because I don’t feel I should have to pay $80 for a game and then a further $80-100 to actually be able to play it. 

I have no interest in playing online MMOs because I don’t enjoy being griefed by other players and having to deal with dodgy online economies. Since I just want to play it by myself I don’t get why they didn’t include a single-player offline mode for those who want to play it like a traditional fallout; they would probably make a ton of extra sales if they did release such a mode. 

It particularly hurts because this is the last fallout we will probably get until 2030 (meaning that the last fallout game I was able to play was fallout 4 in 2015). In fact what stings the most is that we probably got this instead of a new Vegas style spin-off from fallout 4 (where another full game is made using the assets and engines from another. I remember being so excited for a full day when they had the stand-by announcement at E3 the year it was announced and being so throughly disappointed by what was eventually revealed. 

I severely hope that if we do ever get a fallout 5 that they do a single player spinoff instead like with New Vegas, so that we get more single-player fallout.
    >This is because I don’t feel I should have to pay $80 for a game and then a further $80-100 to actually be able to play it.

Yep. An utterly terrible practice that started with subscription MMOs (popularized by WoW) and that the game industry has been trying to sneak some form of into other kinds of video games ever since.
    [deleted]
        That’s the point. I’m literally saying I’ve never played 76 because I want to play single player not multiplayer.
Nah, it's pretty great as it is, more people should try it
Literaly nobody asked for a multiplayer Fallout game. At the very least there was demand for a coop experience akin to Borderlands, where you could still play offline solo if you wanted but it was better with friends. We got this half-baked and forced cashgrab called Fallout 76 because the suits at Zenimax wanted to go the greedy way with live services just before the Microsoft sale.
    Right on the money, in every sense of the word.
Not even remotely.

It was interesting seeing all those people crying about it even though you can essentially play it as a single player experience. With a few rare exceptions, there is zero obligation for you to interact with any other player in the game.
    I think it’s because most of the people complaining about it being a multiplayer game are people who haven’t actually played it and just want to be angry about it with other people who also haven’t played it
    Zero obligation to interact with other players, but the game is still a multiplayer game and designed as such. Thus it's terrible as a singleplayer experience.
Not really, I enjoy it as the multiplayer game it wasn’t meant to be. Plus you can enjoy it solo really easily anyways. Besides I like it being controversial so I can get funny looks whenever I say it’s the closest to original Fallout
Then don't play with other people? I don't and it's like any other Fallout
I'll never get over it.
A big part of 76 is the community and the events and continuation of the game via updates.  It wouldn't have any of that if it were just single player.
This was litteraly just asked 2 days ago...

&#x200B;

I do not mind an online Fallout game but they are not enough mechanics to justefy it being online only but I am happy that Bethesda Game Studios got the oppurtonity to make an online experience.
What bothered me the was that they launched it thinking THEY DIDN'T NEED NPCS!! 

What brain dead mirelurk went "yea, it's a Bethesda title based on an RPG, but we can make it work without the NPCs, who needs them?"
    They had npcs, just not human ones that were alive. It also had the best Fallout story of the 3D games.
I mean, would I have preferred a new single-player experience? Yeah... But that's not what 76 is about. It's really designed not necessarily as an MMO but designed for interactivity and everyone bonding together. Again, not super what I was looking for but now that I've experienced it for a few months? It's not too shabby.
I think it's the best Fallout game so far.. the interaction and the community in general makes the game absolutely fantastic
I play it that way, so no it doesnt bother me at all.
F4 felt like an empty game, multiplayer was a positive step forward.

At least now when you spend 20 hours building a camp people will actually see it.
I think everyone overreacts the game is good. From my experience most people who don’t like it don’t have friends to play with. I know a game shouldent be designed to make you play with friends to have fun but I love it anyway.
It basically is a single player game.  

You can shop at other players bases and play alongside them in special events if you want.  

But you are really roaming the world and doing fallout things like any fallout game.  I have no idea why 76 is talked about like it’s so different from 3, 4 or New Vegas.
yes. like with every bethesda game it could’ve been so much more but some higher up (probably todd or zenimax) had to fuck it up. 76 isn’t bad though i genuinely have fun with it.
I kind of ignore Fallout 76 for the most part.

As far as i am concerned, the game may as well not even exist.
    You're missing out on a pretty good game.
        Not from what i heard.
            Yeah but you’re hearing it predominantly from people who either haven’t played it ever, haven’t played it since launch, and or just have a huge grudge that it exists at all
No.
No.
Nope.

I am familiar with spinoffs and was not surprised that Fallout would try the light survival game. Unfortunately they didn't commit and backed down.
I find it to be a great single player game right now.   It's just a single player game that requires that I be connected online.  It really doesn't play that much differently from FO4.  I treat the other players like highly unpredictable companions (with all voice options off).
Yes. I tried it out back in 2018 as my first fallout experience and loved the style and map, but couldn’t get into it cause of the MP aspect. Idk why they didn’t just do a GTA style on/off for MP, or haven’t after all this time. Even back before the NPCs were added I liked the idea of the environmental storytelling quite a lot
It still does. I was extremely hyped while watching the very first cinematic reveal trailer but lost all interest when they showed what it actually was. I actually like Fallout 4 and its building/settlement mechanics quite a bit but haven't tried 76 because of that lasting distaste. Honestly, I'd probably like it in the state it's in now, but haven't taken the time to try it out.
Yea feel the same way about ESO
Yes
I never even played it because I have no interest in multiplayer.
I was instantly pissed off at the reveal trailer because I saw it for the money grab it was.  

Iirc, at the time I knew it was way too soon for FO5, so I was hoping for New Vegas 2, but figured that some switch ports were more realistic.
I've always thought a coop fallout with optional invaders would be a good idea. Then we got 76 and I lost a lot of hope.
Yes, every day.
I HATE that it is not single player only. Because the way they built the game with having multiplayer in mind, it lacks a proper single player, since so many elements behave like they are multiplayer even if you are in a private world. Plus, there are so many events that you really cant do in single player, its just impossible. Like the scorchbeast queen just for one

&#x200B;

So yeah, they built a half-a$$ed multiplayer fallout game that literally no one wanted. I assume anyway
    Scorched Earth can be done solo if you have a good build with high enough DPS (although to be fair, new players who just completed the main story usually do not), critical hits are particularly effective because they bypass damage reduction.
Yes. I don’t like to play multiplayer games. And the whole thing where they launched with 0 npcs because “other players are the npcs” was SO dumb. The storytelling through notes and recordings sucked. The world was empty and didn’t feel intractable at all. Even now after they’ve tried to fix that, it still feels like a ghost of a proper game.
The settlement building feature in this map would've made me forget F4 even existed
Release a single player version, of local co-op version, with mod support, or gtfo
I can’t say it should or shouldn’t have been, the multi player appeals to different people but personally I can’t stand it even if I don’t see anyone else it still requires me to be online with no pause options that I know of. Fallout games have always been a lone wanderer experience to me it’s the feeling of desolation that makes it special.
It does. It sucks cause I really love the game. If I could transfer my stuff from console to pc I'd get it again.
Game launched with no npc lmao what a joke
It’s why I don’t play it.
Yes, it bothers me.  One aspect in particular.  2 aspects of their pitch were at complete odds with each other.  "Full base-building capabilities, just like in Fallout 4!"

And

"You can track down nuke codes and use them to launch a nuke anywhere on the map!  Even another player's base!"

What the f*** were they thinking?  The only reason I would spend any time on a base at all would be to make it cool, which would take a long damn time.  Why would I put in any effort at all, when some dipshit could just take a look at it and say "Huh, cool.  Think I'll blow it up."  


So unbelievably stupid.  And Bethesda's response to this backlash was "Well yeah, someone COULD, but it takes a really long time to get a nuke and someone wouldn't just waste it on that."  Are you friggin kidding me?  Have you played with gamers online?  They're the friggin worst.  And it wasn't long before the stories started coming out of people stockpiling nukes.  The whole thing is just ridiculous, and is only one facet of the burning dumpster fire that 76 is/was.  I'm aware it's "better now", but they F'd up so many aspects of the game, showing they don't really understand the spirit of it, that I'm never going to reward them for it by giving them money.
Nope. I think 76 thrives as a MMO.
No, the point was to have a multiplayer Fallout. There's multiple singleplayer fallout games, let there be one multiplayer game. Tes has ESO, Fallout has Fo76, and I hope Starfield gets a multiplayer game of its own one day.
Every time I use VATS, or. No mods or have to pay extra for a single player experience private server or the horrible economy.
Absolutly.  I’m glad it bankrupted them pour encourage les autres developers.

Taking a single player mod friendly RPG and turning into always online no mods PvE just to chase a trend as aged milk as Fortnite.

They deserved this
    >it bankrupted them pour encourage les autres developers.

Lmao, what? What on earth makes you think they lost money?
A multiplayer fallout isn’t necessarily a bad idea, but the way they went about it kind of showed that Bethesda kind of didn’t understand what players like (fallout fan says bethesda mishandles the franchise, shocker ik). On launch, they had barely any interesting locations with deep backstory and lore and no characters to make the world feel more alive. I know we’re one of the first vaults to open after the bombs, but there could’ve been ways to still have npcs in the overworld and it make sense. Colony of ghouls, people had their own fallout shelters, stuff like that. 

To me, it felt like Bethesda’s impression of fallout fans were, “people who like to shoot stuff” when there are dozens of games that have WAY better combat mechanics. We love fallout for its interesting world-building and engaging branching stories, not just to be an empty world where you do essentially nothing but kill things
    > barely any interesting locations with deep backstory

I suppose you didn't read any terminals or holotapes.

> there could’ve been ways to still have npcs in the overworld and it make sense

There were, albeit they were robots.

But...

> not just to be an empty world where you do essentially nothing but kill things

Have you played recently? Or at least since the Wastelanders update? The game is nothing like at launch.
    I'm sorry, you're saying Appalachia didn't have backstory? Even at launch there was literally 2 apocalypses worth.

The Automation Riots, the corruption at The Capitol, Hornwright evicting people, automation and terrorism in Watoga, the survaliance and executions at Sugargrove, West Tek and Huntersville, The Enclave and The Whitesprings, The Free States bunkers and militias, The Responders, rich people at Top Of The World, David and the five raider gangs, Targerdy's Thunder, Rose and The Charleston Flood, The Firebreathers, The Scorched Plague, Abbie's research, The Overseer's fiancee, the list goes on.

Appalachia is both the largest and densest map, even *before* 5 years of updates!
Almost everyone plays it as a single player game anyway. Give it a try, PvP/ griefing are practically non existent these days because Bethesda realised that wasn't what the playerbase was interested in. 99.9% of interactions with other players are positive because it has one of the most wholesome communities in gaming
It did at first, then I got playing enough to see how absolutely terrible all the quests were. Then I didn't care at all.
It would have been a superior game if it was.  It
Would have fit in if it was a dlc for fo4 since it used the weapons and crafting system from fo4.  Not including weapon and armor degradation, but that should have been in fo4 anyway.
Yup. Honestly I wish they'd released Elder Scrolls 6 instead, skipped Starfield (which was painfully bad) and they could've had a new singleplayer Fallout already
Nope. The single player games feel a little TOO desolate for me.
People with opinions like yours literally just need to play the game. It being multiplayer doesn't take away from it at all. It's an amazing game and a great fallout game.

Just play it. You almost never see players unless doing events or looking for them.
I feel like they wasted easily the best game world we've seen on a half-baked multiplayer game. I'm glad its doing better these day, but yeah it would've been far better reworked into a standard SP expierence.
Naw, I was pretty much done with Bethesda Fallout games after FO4. There's no way they're going to reverse course on any of that - so there's not much reason to look forward to what's next. FO76 releasing as such a dumpster fire was honestly kind of cathartic.
I wish they had just made it single player and dumped more of their energy into developing the story from the start, instead of the multiplayer aspect.
Always. It’s why I never bought it and won’t really consider it.
Yeah especially when it actually has skill checks other than charisma
it irks me
it irks me
I’m hard core fallout since the originals and enjoy modding and debugging through console commands. This didn’t feel like fallout when I bought at midnight on release. It was an open world survival horror. Post wastelanders it feels like fallout again
I think the worst thing about 76 is that they didn't make it client side to the point where I can pop in with a friend with my own game and we could do shenanigan's without it being tied to some multiplayer pay to win experience.   


All they needed to do was give people the option of coop mode or a single player experience and I would have dumped hundreds of hours into the game and purchased DLC.
    It’s really not pay to win though, people keep saying this like it’s a thing, but no gameplay, gear, or Xp leveling is locked behind a paywall. Even with the subscription you’re grinding like everyone else
        Sorry, I meant to say "pay to play". I was told there was the option to pay for a private server at some point. I could be totally wrong with that as I have ignored the game for a number of years.
            You have to pay for private servers, but public ones are free. I have a subscription and access to the private servers, but almost never use them since the public ones are more fun, and are capped at 24 people so I’m you don’t see people often unless you want to
Yes, I have tried to get into it multiple time since launch. I play like 20 hours and after tons of bugs because of it being online and just a focus on daily quests (grinding), I just get bored with it. If it were offline and single player, it would be easier to get into, pausing would be amazing.

Most other player experiences I have had are high level dudes running by and having a bunch of leveled to them creatures in the area now, or they stand there with some emote shooting at you because they want to give you a bag of whatever. Just annoying.
Yes it would have been good but just look at the jumbled mess it has become. 300 different currencies, 300 mini boring quests and a main story that was not engaging or interesting.
Yes. But it especially bothers me that it wasn’t a squad based multiplayer.
I absolutely would prefer it to be a pure single player with an optional experience to do PvE online or just coop.

I don't have quite as much time to game anymore like when 3 and NV came out.  I feel like I was able to progress in abilities and gear at a great pace in those 2 games and didn't feel like I needed to grind anything to continue playing.  Not that 76 is a grind.  Maybe I just got a rough start, but I definitely felt under-gunned and under-supplied for my encounters.  I didn't play super far in though too.

I want to give it another shot and see if my experience is better now.
Do I have to pay to play online?

I mean, do I need to pay for playstation plus or Game pass?
76 was decent. My main issue was how janky it got late game. It couldn't keep up.
All of the time because I still tried to soak up all of the fallout lore and content and the cool creatures for Appalachia and the beautiful map. But the online multiplayer aspects are way too cluttered for me and just straight up not my thing. 

If it had just been the New Vegas for Fallout 4 it would be an amazing game but they sacrificed too much just for live service. A lesson a number of game devs are going to learn this decade
I’m only annoyed by that when I dream up a perfect legendary roll but then remember one or more of the effects doesn’t exist in 76
I've recently started playing FO76 and honestly it does feel more like a single player game anyway. The map is huge with not many players in the world ( I think it's a max of 24) and I rarely come across anyone . The times I have seen other players are when I've actively been to their camps to buy stuff or just randomly come across them . Every interaction has been positive and sometimes they've helped me with items . I'm enjoying it a lot more than I thought I would so far.
It used to. Then Starfield came out...
No not really. It was a single player game where you can encounter other survivors and help them or fight them. It just doesn't play out that way. Now its a single player game that has players in it. You may never find a player but still its fun if you like playing what feels like a empty MMO on life support. Give it a try its not horrendous anymore. Still salty with them screwing me over with my pre-order and not getting the expensive packages you are suppose to get if your like me and payed the high price. Got nothing currently and customer support told me there isn't anything they can do on their end.
I absolutely love it. It’s basically single player but you get to see other peoples house builds. It’s soo fun
Yes.  It's a great game. But I just can't get in to know knowing that things are behind paywalls
Bethesda wanted to be try something different like starfield. They hear the criticism so I’m hoping elder scrolls 6 will be great.
I don't think there's enough of a story line to sustain it as a single player experience, right now what keeps it interesting is the interactions between players.
It bothered me before I had played it. When I started playing it I realised that even though it was online and there were other people I could still play it as a single player game.

The first year or two there were still remnants of the original, bad idea of a pvp centric game. But this portion has been consistently toned down to where now pvp is more or less non existant.

Fallout 76 was not a standard single player game when it launched. But in my experience playing it like a single player game works just fine. In my five years of playing since launch I have played Fallout 76 as a single player game.

If you haven't tried try. Try Fallout 76, go into it with the mindset that it is just another single player Fallout. You can solo everything in Fallout 76. Some things may require you to adapt your build to the challenge. But everything is doable alone. That's my experience at least.
i’ve been playing recently and it feels single player. i’ve run into one or two people over the past week or two, and one was just an insanely leveled player gifting me stim packs
No.
No.

The story was doodoo, having no human NPCs was stupid, having an influx of human NPCs *while* the story is finding out where all the humans have gone was even more stupid. the BoS involvement was lame. the game actively encourages time-wasting and scrounging, *The Atom Shop* etc. etc. 

Fallout is a lot more than just having cool things to shoot. it's weird that's the only thing you've considered to make an amazing Fallout game. 76 is ass, and would have been among the most unremarkable Fallout games if it wasn't multiplayer imo
for me the game lost its magic when i reached end game , sense of discovery and trying to stay alive with low amount of resources was amazing , end game changed the experience for me , now i enter an event and i get showered with loot and ammo , stimpaks it makes the game too easy and boring , building and collecting magazines is cool though
Honestly, I think if it was released in its current state, with the option to play with friends. It would’ve done very, very well. Bethesda was not ready for a large, multi-player game as what we got. But something with a better narrative, and a bit more time to cook in the over, and it could’ve been great.
I would've bought it on release, no matter the release. But I refuse to pay for a game subscription
Yes and no. 

I think something like this is totally fine to exist and if done properly could be something to heighten the IP

However, it existing has caused new single player fallouts from being made, which is terrible.

This should have been treated like it is: a side project.

Instead, we got the worst of both worlds: it's mid at best AND it's supposed to be the current main game in the series, thus delaying fallout 5 another decade
The problem was it was a GAAS multiplayer game.  If it was essentially a single player Bethesda title, with coop, prolly woulda been great.  I still would like multiplayer in bethesda titles, but just let me invite someone to my fallout 4 game, or skyrim, without anything else.
I just wish they'd add an off-line mode.  It's now in a state where you can single-player majority of the game.
Mutations as much as people like them are one of the main reasons behind players teaming up mainly the Herd Mentality if this wasn't in people would play single only teaming up for certain events.
As a thought if this Mutation gave negative effects to teaming up just a thought.
No, I love being able to play with my family and friends.
Honestly a small bit yeah. And I'm one of the small group that really enjoyed the game when it first came out. I loved the world, the feel of it, and I had a lot of fun. I've got three characters of varying levels and story completion, but I haven't touched it in a long, long time. Part of it for me comes down to small things that made it less fun. Being online meant that things could be a bit finnicky at times with hits and damage or movement even, and it meant decisions had to be made to create an online world that worked by certain rules that couldn't be changed. 

But all of that I could and did deal with. It being online meant that it was slowly killed by poor decisions as updates were made. I very much enjoyed the empty world, and while I understand the complaints people had, I thought the environmental and audio storytelling where spectacular and it really did feel like you were coming out into a world that had been destroyed not once but twice, and which you were just picking through the ashes of. That said, I do think they pivoted well and stuff they added to keep things moving and fleshed out was a good call and felt right from the perspective of an ever evolving MMO type of thing. 

But the balance decisions were just constantly moving in the wrong direction. The people deciding how things worked always got the wrong idea from the data and ended up making stuff worse rather than better. Some systems improved, but always in ways that just left them less interactable and made the fact that this game was online make less sense. 

As another commentor put it, if it had just been a single player game with online options, the ability to group up with friends or what have you, I think it would have been a lot better. I loved so much of the world, the story, the style, the building, but so much of it was hampered by the online element.
I'd pay to upgrade to single player.  As it is, I just think of the other players in my shard as particularly janky NPCs.  Still it would be nice if the universe didn't seem to be stuck in a time loop where every change you make to the world disappears over time.  I stopped playing because it just felt like an exercise in nihilism.
If you don’t count every single time I think of that game, then no.  Never.
When it first came out?  Sure, it had a ton of problems, and no real meat to anything you did in game with just glimpses of what it could be. 

Now?  No, the story they have added can be done single player and you can still group up with friends to take on big challenges. It's not perfect by any means, but I have had a blast playing it with my friends and helping others.  The content added has been very cool like weapons from older games or the new cryptids to fight
Worst thing is that fo76 has some truly great game mechanics, drom what ive seen my friend play the vats gameplay looks crazy. Google commando sneak build and watch on yt how slick the Gameplay is.
The Bethesda-rot is what i dreaded most. Simplification, lore and tone mishaps and the complete apathy to finishing a product.
No, because it was never going to be one.

The birth of 76 started when Bethesda wanted to add a co op mode to fallout 4. That ended up being a gigantic undertaking to basically re code the entire layout of the game and the way the whole map worked and instead of throwing all that hard work out when it was clear it wasn't going to be ready in time they re purposed it
If there were an offline option, I'd be playing it now. I have some issues with online games (enemies respawning more quickly, holotapes/notes being taken and not respawning quick enough, internet speed playing a role in accuracy and ability to play, etc) that really take away my ability yo enjoy the game. This especially sucks for 76, as I've been a Fallout fan for 15 years and the world of 76 looks amazing. I played through about 20 hours before I couldn't deal with the various issues and bugs, but I did like what I was able to see. I've heard that since Wastelanders came out they've fixed a bunch of stuff, but I'm still hesitant to give it another try. It seems like a lot of the issues I was having are solely due to it being online
No, bc you can pretty much play it like a single-player.
Yes. Big time. I play video games to not have to deal with other people, not to watch power armor bros ruin scorchbeast fights
I am just sad it will be shut down one day
I did jump in and play for a bit. I enjoyed being back in the Fallout world, but it was clearly very different. 
 
Its found an audience, so there are plenty of people enjoying it which is great. I'm hopeful though, that with it all connecting under Xbox, that we see single player Fallout like 3 and New Vegas was done.  
 
Bethesda can rotate through their IP and do them slowly, just let someone else create non-numbered games in between, based off where Bethesda left it (i.e. use Fallout 76 as a jump off point for a single player game made by another Xbox studio).
 
Also, Xbox needs atleast 1, and probably 2 studios that specialize in remakes/remasters, like Bluepoint is to Sony. With all the IP they now own, putting out a couple remakes per year should be a no-brainer. If they did that, I imagine Fallout 3 and New Vegas would make the list for remake worthy, and that would help fill the void a bit.
YES!!!!! A THOUSAND TIMES YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yes because I'm not paying for effin PSN.
It was missing npc companions and a feeling of permanence.  Popping into a game and someone nuking where you want to be sucks.  I don't like the way the power armor works.  It feels the opposite of immersive.  I keep going back to 4 and playing with mods like ss2 and america rising feels almost like a new game.
I'd be pissed if it were a standalone solo Fallout game. The game is ass once you're finished the campaign and if you don't like to spend 12 hours a day doing the same shit over and over and over again.

Edit: I hate the NPCs. Sorry, but I fucking hate them. They are so fucking corny. I just cannot. When they added MORE Responders in the Atlantic City update, I was fucking done. And I live right outside of Atlantic City. I was psyched. Deleted that shit as soon as I saw the "Big Update" wasn't even an update. Just some more asshole NPCs and another """Expedition""". Couldn't give less of a shit about the update coming this Spring. Not gonna wait 3 more months for your lame shit. Sorry, that's just me though.
Ever since it was announced.

Bethesda at least should have a proper single player mode for the game.
The only thing that bothers me about 76 is your special stats capping at 50 and preventing you from upgrading your perk cards or adding any others cause of lack of space. Other than that, I love everything about ghe game.
Every day…
When I first heard of Fallout 76 prior to its launch, I thought to myself I'm online Fallout game would be a good idea. But it wasn't a very good idea at the time, the game has improved and is much more fun to play online in the events with other people, but like GTA or Red Dead Redemption, it would have been a lot better if there was a single player mode as well as online mode.
Isn't there an option to play it offline? I thought there was one.
Every day
I never bothered with Fallout 76 BECAUSE it was a multiplayer game by default. It's not worth the time to frustratingly grind through with strangers.
Every day! I HATE that it's an online game, hate.
They did it because of ESO
It bothers me that Starfield wasn't multiplayer
This is what I always wanted out of it. I played it a fair bit but wasn't overly crazy about the online multiplayer lobby idea. I've always just wanted a co-op fallout game to play with friends, not with a bunch of strangers online. Personally speaking, Fallout 76 would have been better as a single player or co-op game. I still hope they make a co-op Fallout game some time. Building bases with friends, exploring the wastes, etc. While you can build with friends, nothing outside of camps is saved, taking away from wanting to build anything elaborate or interesting.
    If they would have made it like borderlands co-op then it'd have been better 
        Yeah, that's pretty well as ideal of way to do it as I could think of. It does stink having the progress tied to the host sometimes, but having a good group of friends to screw around with makes it worth it, at least for a playthrough or two.
    I have never really interacted with people in 76 apart from friends or exploring peoples’ neat camp builds. The events draw other players but i have only been griefed once and it amounted to nothing. By saving blueprints or partial blueprints you can pretty much deploy your multiple camps, shelter, etc. quite easily without much cost. I mostly just jump in with my group of friends, we pop up our camps, and never have to worry about anyone else.  Sometimes we have funny moments of “look at those two guys on the roof shooting raiders. Lol anyways…” I dont so much see it as a lobby situation as much as a trade off. I cant save and reload, but if i screw up i can jump out of the world until a friend can get there to help:) i think the mechanics are more towards a world of cooperative strangers. The Casual Party feature lets you fast travel and get XP just because some random person is doing something somewhere. It is like the random encounters. Obviously i would love a fallout that worked like Borderlands but with how rough this game was released im not holding my breath:/
    > I still hope they make a co-op Fallout game some time. Building bases with friends, exploring the wastes, etc. While you can build with friends, nothing outside of camps is saved, taking away from wanting to build anything elaborate or interesting.

Well, god damn, you got me hooked.
    It sort of is. If you have a (senses unease from others) Fallout 1st Sub, you can have that private world, and the ability to play with just a small group of friends (up to 7 other friends in world). And while I do agree that CAMP building could do with a lot more life than it currently has (at the moment they can only have 1 Camp Ally, so they do feel lifeless), I've seen some downright amazing 'settlements' done by groups of friends who build their CAMPS together one next to the other, which makes them look an awful lot like proper settlements. So it's entirely co-op playable with a small group of friends.
        Most of the time when I played it was a great experience overall but there were some things that made it feel off. Losing progress on daily type quests if you logged out without completing them, losing progress on workshop bases, and how some of the co-op quests didn't really work as a co-op experience. 

I remember playing the beta with a couple friends and we had a blast working on a workshop base together only for us to lose all progress once you log out. Camps have come a long way and there is a lot you can do in a Camp, but overall the progression just felt strange with some elements in the game as it was designed. 

I don't have high hopes but that's okay. I had a lot of fun in 76 when I played it and at some point may return. I don't regret the time I spent with the game even with its flaws.
        >If you have a (senses unease from others) Fallout 1st Sub

You shouldn't have to buy something else on top of buying the game to get something that Beth could have easily implemented.
    Yeah thats pretty much exactly my view point. I really like the world, the mobs, the gameplay and whatnot, but I just couldn't get past it being an open lobby type thing. Still bums me out lol
Any time someone makes a game that could be either single player or multi player, there's really only two ways to work out the logistics of how many players you're accommodating. If it's single player, then the world has a narrative focused around the player and their advancements - including permanent changes to the world and its inhabitants - and drop-in multi player usually just means someone else gets to help them shape that narrative cooperatively. See Baldur's Gate 3 for a recent example; even if you have a party of four, one is still the "host" and the main character for major events/cutscenes. Conversely, if you design an open world multi player game, then every player must have an opportunity to engage with each element of the content at possibly any time, and so you must largely retain a static, unchanging world where at best, people can visit quests/events sort of like amusement park attractions: a party goes into the "ride", fights the bad guys, slays the evil boss, and then when they leave, all the props reset for the next group. Defeated the ultimate evil that was plaguing the land, and thus saved all of mankind? Well another paying customer has to be able to do that after you, so your efforts mean nothing; the instance resets and the big bad is right back on his throne.

I have always had precisely zero interest in engaging with the latter style of play, for precisely the reason that it's all just so hollow and unrewarding; there's no purpose in playing the game except just to be there with other people. You can never tell a developing story where players have impact, because if you let one person change the world then someone else misses out. The closest you can get is when the developers do expansions/updates that finally, eventually walk the world narrative forward for everyone at the same time. Even then, it can often lower engagement if people joining the game later are told, "Oh yeah, seasons 1 and 2 were great but season 3 is kinda 'meh' now. Shame you'll never be able to go back and play any of those missions."

If you're going to make a multiplayer game, then I'd argue one should package the narrative such that it can be resolved in the span of a typical a multiplayer session. Everyday shooters like CoD or even Quake do this plainly by having little or no story (short term objectives at best, usually) and just being a deathmatch, while co-op titles like Left 4 Dead set a great standard for telling "short stories" where you can just drop in with 3 friends and go, and it's all over in 45-90 minutes. But in my opinion, RPGs are a dogshit fit for massive online multiplayer because it doesn't matter how much you develop your character if they can never actually make a difference in the narrative. It all just becomes "costumes" of various colors going on the same "rides".

I do make an exception for PvP focused RPGs because in those the way you build your character determines how well you fight against others, but even then the story is vestigial to the PvP gameplay; you could just attach a leveling/progression system to a session-based shooter like L4D or CoD and that would still work, without trying to shoehorn in never-progressing story elements.

That's how I perceive it, at least. Sorry for the novel, and thanks for reading.
    How about best of both worlds? A single player based game where people can pop in and out, plus a hub area with multiplayer content where you can take your character. Like GTA online-ish except they would share the same character.
    You described the problem with multiplayer games quite expertly.   


I think the inherent problem with a massively multiplayer focused game is that they make use of MMO conventions... most of which are terrible mechanics that MMOs should never have done in the first place. Various  mechanics designed to make it take an absurd amount of time to do things. Enemies that respawn within seconds. Slow movement designed to make it take much longer than necessary or realistic to get from one place to the next. Microtransactions designed to alleviate the grind at the cost of sweet sweet green. etc.  


The point of multiplayer has always been not to provide players more content, but to have the players themselves provide the content. If you're running around yakking with your friends while taking on some boss, you're less likely to notice or care that there's next to no real story taking place. Singleplayer games have to have content in place for the player, but with multiplayer the player you're fighting with or alongside can just... be the content. More accurately, there's zero reason for the devs not to provide the content in a multiplayer game, but why bother when the players will do all the work for them?  


It's shallow and pointless.
    Thanks for typing it. That's pretty insightful, and makes tremendous sense.
    This is a great way to put it, and I completely agree. I think borderlands handles multiplayer very well where when someone hops into your game, they up the difficulty/level of enemies to compensate, but otherwise the gameplay remains largely unchanged, and it's more that first scenario where the host is advancing a story and changing the world. I haven't played baldurs gate, but it looks great, and knowing it's that first type as well definitely seals the deal for me as I want to play that with my gf. 

I'm all in on that first type, and the way you explained the second type is probably why I've never really liked those games. It all feels hollow and nothing ever really changes.
        My fiancée and I have been going through BG3 exclusively in co-op mode, and it’s been an amazing time. Highly recommended, even if it’s a bit daunting using all the fine details with a controller (dual keyboard and mouse isn’t possible on split screen mode).
    There is another POSSIBLE approach, but it's expensive and technically complex.  Break the game into major chapters.  Give the story a couple major inflection points, and have a cluster of game servers running for each stage of the story progression.  In FO75, I'd have 2 sets of servers.  One before you deal with the scorched queen and one for after.
    I think the option for private servers would have been nice, but I don't know how feasible it would be for a game of this scope. And it still would not solve the problems you pointed out with how single boss fights and story progression are handled. One really nice thing about most fallout games is the environmental story telling. I think maybe they could have leaned a lot more heavily into that to find some kind of middle ground with terminals, notes, etc that can still be found by everyone playing in that game instance without having to rely on them having to all be on at the same time. But then again you'd have to miss out on creating meaningful encounters or, as you said, have them watered down with endless respawns. I hadn't thought about a lot of the issues you pointed out with regards to creating a multi-player rpg, so it does give me a good perspective. Thanks for the information!
    The analysis of multiplayer vs massive multiplayer is spot on, but I disagree about the player not having impacts and being rewarded. Unlocks, leveling up, better gear, etc. can all be tied to characters and handed out as rewards. They're the usual RPG staples.

As for impacts, it's not going to be on a massive scale, but between characters and specifics? Absolutely. The use of instances, interior environments that are exclusive to the player/party, means simultaneous a d opposing choices can be made on individual scales.

The repetition also provides a safety net that's really needed when open ended RPGs become multiplayer. Imagine if Fallout 4 had multiplayer crowbarred into it. You're going to talk to Desdamona and join the Railroad when your buddy thinks it would be funny to open fire. Well, guess that questline is gone forever. ...Oops!

Even the big stuff from single player games are eventually flattened by the series itself. The Vault Dweller? Open in Fallout, flattened by Fallout 2. The Lone Wanderer? Open in Fallout 3, flattened by Fallout 4. All that's fluid turns solid eventually.
    They could add a whole single player option and maybe even mod support while keeping the open world multiplayer from the second scenario as a base ‘get on and piss away a few hours after work or school or cause you’re bored” but also have a game mode that is more driven towards a single person, or a main character in a group of people on a more story driven, still open world style similar to the other fallout games, just with the option of playing it multiplayer. So many other games use the single main character multiplayer party style and it has been around for a long time, so I would’ve thought that would’ve been the choice for 76
    Loved the rant, so don't apologise. 😃


Ironically, you just described Nuclear Winter in option 2 mechanics wise. And Bethesda removed that option (much to the disappointment of many). Because the chimera that is 76 is the lowest common denominator of both worlds. And somehow makes them a considerable amount of money.
I put over 1k hours into 76 and played solo the entire time and enjoyed it. I honestly had a great time and didn't know a single friend that played.

Point is it can be very fun single player. I did every single mission solo.
    I may have go get on and give it another go. I honestly can't say what about the open lobby style turned me away from it, I just had a hard time getting into real good because of it.
        So there's a bunch of people coming back like right now, and are overjoyed in love with it. 

https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/returning.html

Enter in the last time you played and it should show you everything you missed and what's new. 

I don't know if you have an Xbox or if your PC is pretty good, but Xbox Gamepass has the whole fallout series. I'm pretty sure you can get two weeks for $1.
            I have it for Xbox, but have gotten to where I primarily play everything on PC over the past year. Thanks for the link. I'm gonna check it out again and see if I can get into it this time.
The worst part for me is that they **put infinite material storage space behind a fucking monthly subscription paywall**

As a loot hoarder, the moment I saw that it killed my desire to play and I immediately stopped
    Once you get a feel for what you're doing and what you actually need it's really not that bad. I can't remember the last time I've actually had to go out and grind materials and I have several hundred hours in the game.
        As a self-confessed hoarder this was tough to learn for F76, but worth it.

I realised that if I capped myself to holding no more than about 100 of each resource I had more than enough to build anything, anytime.  Slight exception for ammo crafting materials, but if I needed to build a new CAMP, not a problem.

And as you say, you quickly learn where to go to replenish if you run low.

Selling spare crafting materials in my personal vendor also provided a steady income.
    Yeah, that was a big factor for me. I enjoy hoarding materials so that when I end up going full tilt on building a base or something I don't have to go hunting for stuff every 5 minutes.
Yeah I mean. I don't know about you but when I was a kid saying "I wish oblivion/fallout 3/Skyrim was multiplayer" I meant Borderlands style, not World of Warcraft style.
I was hoping it would be like Left 4 Dead, where if you want to play on your own, you can have up to 3 AI companions you can use, or up to 3 friends can join in and do co-op missions, or a mix of both. Limiting the number of other players would allow much more polished multiplayer missions that allow everyone to participate, where objectives could rely on different people being in different locations at the same time (ie hacking multiple computers simultaneously, ambushes, etc).
I've been a mad Fallout fan before New Vegas was announced, and comments like yours are why I have no regrets in even trying 76.
Same I quit and just couldn't get into it again
Being able to use vats. 

Actually just the whole fallout 4 engine then changing when you go online for a new online mode that can just play the whole campaign
Agree, I picked it up on sale and thought it was fine, but I just couldn't get into it. And most of the other players I ran into were either super high levels playing with their friends, so no real threat or interest to me or griefers who'd kill me, loot my body for the like 2 tin cans and rotten fruit in my inventory, who'd then hunt me down at my respawn to do the same to me again because how dare I have "nothing of value in my inventory" when I had only just started the game. -\_-
F76 is a single player game within a multiplayer world.

It's like Runescape/OSRS or it's sister game ESO.

The game might be played on a multiplayer server, but unless you physically go seeking multiplayer content you can realistically play the entire game, main story line, Setters/Raiders Quests, BOS quests and even solo each expedition without requiring a single person.

You can make the argument then why does it have to be a game, and to that the game is better for it. F76 has the best community I've ever seen for an online game. There are so few toxic players it's shocking.
    Because it isn't a PvP centric game
I bumped into someone being a moron before I even got out of my own vault. I get that for most people it’s not a big deal, but I really wish you could just play it offline.
I feel like I’m going crazy. There’s been a handful of these posts lately. I can’t recall the game requiring any multiplayer at all, whatsoever.
    The only multiplayer it really requires is a constant connection to a server , other than that it can be treated and played like any other SP Fallout game . 

I feel like most of the people who make these posts havent really ever bothered with the game to begin with and give opinions based of what they heard 5 years ago
        To some extent, I'm the person you're describing.  I'm not hanging onto any old opinions of the game, but knowing that the server connection is required feels dirty, kind of like where Blizzard took the Diablo series.  Even if I never encounter another soul, knowing that I'm not truly alone is (admittely, irrationally) kind of annoying.

That said, I do intend to play the game one of these days, and I expect I'll thoroughly enjoy it, but I've also been trying to vote with my dollars to some extent by putting it off this long.
            I avoided it at launch but picked it up about a year later for £6.  I then got a good 600+ hours out of it, with most of that time playing essentially solo, just in an online world with other players.

There are some things you adapt your playstyle for - you can't hoard everything you ever found being the hardest for me - but as far as other player interaction it was often only seeing other people in well travelled areas like merchants or big world events.
Came here to say this! I have played FO76 from beginning to end solo and I loved it!

That being said, it did always feel like I couldn’t make a significant impact on the world (like.. I made a vaccine against scorched and they’re still everywhere. I killed the scorchbeast queen and the beasts are still around. Stuff like that is the compromise that a game like this has to make to work for every player, I guess.
Can’t leave a huge crater on the map like in FO3 or FO4, if someone else wants to explore the place that used to be there.

But that’s really only a minor complaint for me, as you still change things in the world. The changes are just not as impactful.
>I would hope someone or Bethesda releases a single player version in future but that is a big ask.

Yeah, a big ask for sure. They'd have to completely revamp the game from the ground up to do that. Even if someday they released a means to play 76 without requiring a server connection at all, the game is still built to be an multiplayer game and thus isn't designed for a singleplayer experience. The only way a single player version could work is by redesigning the game, and at that point they'd probably just make a new singleplayer Fallout instead.
I tried to play it as single player but the third time I had to move my house I was done.
    You don’t have to move your house, if someone else is in your CAMP spot, you can just switch to a different CAMP, or switch servers

It’s not usually a problem unless you pick one of the more popular spots, like the ones near the Whitespring
    That issue has been fixed for years
        Seems like most of the complaints are back in year 1 when it was very rough and lacking lots of content; it's much better now. Seriously impressed at all the QOL they put into fixing the little things.
        I didn't play the game at all until a few months ago.
            If that's the case, then you didn't HAVE to move your house, the game notifies you that your camp can't be placed on that world due to another players camp being there, and you can simply leave that server and join one where your camp can be placed
                Logging in and out of servers is so much fun/  

No thanks.
                    Oh no, waiting a whole minute! Literally unplayable.
                        Why is it so important to defend the game to me? 

Am I not allowed to dislike 76?
                            You are. You're just wrong about some of the game's mechanics.
                                >You are.

It would very much seem otherwise.
    You don't HAVE to move your home though. Nobody forced you to move it ...
        Yes but the alternative is logging out and then hoping that when I log back in the spot is available.  No thanks.
            You’re not going to play it I get that, but each account starts with two CAMP slots, typically what people do is build up both, then if one is blocked they can just deploy the second

I have a few CAMPs in popular spots, and never once had both blocked on the same server. 

Doing this takes just a few seconds on a bad day, and doesn’t interrupt the flow of the game at all

This information isn’t so much for you because it’s obvious you’re invested in not playing the game, but for anyone reading and thinking this might somehow be a barrier to playing or enjoying the game, when in fact for most people it’s a complete non issue
Bingo. Also, they were trying to quickly build their portfolio so Microsoft would buy them. And what better way to inflate your value than to have more recurring-spending types of games?
Zenimax made that decision lol.
    I guess Microsoft can be your scapegoat now?
        Being factually accurate is not scapegoating.
            So yea, you will be blaming Microsoft for all the bad decisions and praising Bethesda for all the success in your "Well... Ackually," replies.  

Never mind that the entire structure from capital to creatives is colloquially known as Bethesda, but you think being pedantic will mean that people don't know that the blame still falls on the group as a whole.  

I suppose the distinction makes you feel safer that the next single-player Bethesda game will be stunningly GOAT... said everyone before Starfield launched.
                I have been criticizing Bethesda directly since the game released. I was just complaining about the lack of dungeons in Starfield last week. You are talking out of your ass making strawman arguments.
Yep. A subscription for a singleplayer mode that should be the default in the first place.
    I got fo76 for like 5 bucks, played it maybe once. good map, but I'd prefer (as dumb as it sounds) the gamebryo engine over whatever amalgam of the creation engine it uses. Better combat and such.
>The series is filled with excellent single player games, but between Starfield and Elder Scrolls 6 the next mainline Fallout game is going to be a while off. If 76 was just a single player spin off game from 4, we would get 76, some DLC and patches, and then absolutely nothing new for the Fallout IP for years.

A problem that could be easily solved by Bethesda simply... hiring more people and forming studios specifically to handle creating the games for each IP at the same time. Thus releasing a new entry in each series every 2-3 years instead of somewhere in the area of 7-8.
Create a problem, and sell the solution. Scummy af
    For sure.
It is partly true, in the sense that another studio helped adding multiplayer capability to the engine, but most of Fallout 4's team did work on 76 until launch, and the creative direction was from there, so it was a different type of project than Fallout: New Vegas or Elder Scrolls Online in any case. [This article](https://kotaku.com/sources-fallout-76-is-an-online-survival-rpg-1826425333) that was posted within a day of the initial announcement was fairly accurate, but many other rumors were circulating until the reveal at E3, a lot of people probably hoped more for a single player spin-off, or one with an optional co-op mode.
but they couldn’t sell micro transactions that way.
    Yeah they are pretty greedy. They could always just do more creation club or fallout 1st type stuff, but that probably wouldn’t be enough for them
1k hours here. Agreed. By far my favorite - and all played single player.
They could probably allow it to work offline pretty easily, but the game was still designed to be a multiplayer game. Thus they'd have to remake 76 from the ground up to really turn it into a singleplayer game.
>This is because I don’t feel I should have to pay $80 for a game and then a further $80-100 to actually be able to play it.

Yep. An utterly terrible practice that started with subscription MMOs (popularized by WoW) and that the game industry has been trying to sneak some form of into other kinds of video games ever since.
[deleted]
    That’s the point. I’m literally saying I’ve never played 76 because I want to play single player not multiplayer.
Right on the money, in every sense of the word.
I think it’s because most of the people complaining about it being a multiplayer game are people who haven’t actually played it and just want to be angry about it with other people who also haven’t played it
Zero obligation to interact with other players, but the game is still a multiplayer game and designed as such. Thus it's terrible as a singleplayer experience.
They had npcs, just not human ones that were alive. It also had the best Fallout story of the 3D games.
You're missing out on a pretty good game.
    Not from what i heard.
        Yeah but you’re hearing it predominantly from people who either haven’t played it ever, haven’t played it since launch, and or just have a huge grudge that it exists at all
Scorched Earth can be done solo if you have a good build with high enough DPS (although to be fair, new players who just completed the main story usually do not), critical hits are particularly effective because they bypass damage reduction.
>it bankrupted them pour encourage les autres developers.

Lmao, what? What on earth makes you think they lost money?
> barely any interesting locations with deep backstory

I suppose you didn't read any terminals or holotapes.

> there could’ve been ways to still have npcs in the overworld and it make sense

There were, albeit they were robots.

But...

> not just to be an empty world where you do essentially nothing but kill things

Have you played recently? Or at least since the Wastelanders update? The game is nothing like at launch.
I'm sorry, you're saying Appalachia didn't have backstory? Even at launch there was literally 2 apocalypses worth.

The Automation Riots, the corruption at The Capitol, Hornwright evicting people, automation and terrorism in Watoga, the survaliance and executions at Sugargrove, West Tek and Huntersville, The Enclave and The Whitesprings, The Free States bunkers and militias, The Responders, rich people at Top Of The World, David and the five raider gangs, Targerdy's Thunder, Rose and The Charleston Flood, The Firebreathers, The Scorched Plague, Abbie's research, The Overseer's fiancee, the list goes on.

Appalachia is both the largest and densest map, even *before* 5 years of updates!
It’s really not pay to win though, people keep saying this like it’s a thing, but no gameplay, gear, or Xp leveling is locked behind a paywall. Even with the subscription you’re grinding like everyone else
    Sorry, I meant to say "pay to play". I was told there was the option to pay for a private server at some point. I could be totally wrong with that as I have ignored the game for a number of years.
        You have to pay for private servers, but public ones are free. I have a subscription and access to the private servers, but almost never use them since the public ones are more fun, and are capped at 24 people so I’m you don’t see people often unless you want to
If they would have made it like borderlands co-op then it'd have been better 
    Yeah, that's pretty well as ideal of way to do it as I could think of. It does stink having the progress tied to the host sometimes, but having a good group of friends to screw around with makes it worth it, at least for a playthrough or two.
I have never really interacted with people in 76 apart from friends or exploring peoples’ neat camp builds. The events draw other players but i have only been griefed once and it amounted to nothing. By saving blueprints or partial blueprints you can pretty much deploy your multiple camps, shelter, etc. quite easily without much cost. I mostly just jump in with my group of friends, we pop up our camps, and never have to worry about anyone else.  Sometimes we have funny moments of “look at those two guys on the roof shooting raiders. Lol anyways…” I dont so much see it as a lobby situation as much as a trade off. I cant save and reload, but if i screw up i can jump out of the world until a friend can get there to help:) i think the mechanics are more towards a world of cooperative strangers. The Casual Party feature lets you fast travel and get XP just because some random person is doing something somewhere. It is like the random encounters. Obviously i would love a fallout that worked like Borderlands but with how rough this game was released im not holding my breath:/
> I still hope they make a co-op Fallout game some time. Building bases with friends, exploring the wastes, etc. While you can build with friends, nothing outside of camps is saved, taking away from wanting to build anything elaborate or interesting.

Well, god damn, you got me hooked.
It sort of is. If you have a (senses unease from others) Fallout 1st Sub, you can have that private world, and the ability to play with just a small group of friends (up to 7 other friends in world). And while I do agree that CAMP building could do with a lot more life than it currently has (at the moment they can only have 1 Camp Ally, so they do feel lifeless), I've seen some downright amazing 'settlements' done by groups of friends who build their CAMPS together one next to the other, which makes them look an awful lot like proper settlements. So it's entirely co-op playable with a small group of friends.
    Most of the time when I played it was a great experience overall but there were some things that made it feel off. Losing progress on daily type quests if you logged out without completing them, losing progress on workshop bases, and how some of the co-op quests didn't really work as a co-op experience. 

I remember playing the beta with a couple friends and we had a blast working on a workshop base together only for us to lose all progress once you log out. Camps have come a long way and there is a lot you can do in a Camp, but overall the progression just felt strange with some elements in the game as it was designed. 

I don't have high hopes but that's okay. I had a lot of fun in 76 when I played it and at some point may return. I don't regret the time I spent with the game even with its flaws.
    >If you have a (senses unease from others) Fallout 1st Sub

You shouldn't have to buy something else on top of buying the game to get something that Beth could have easily implemented.
Yeah thats pretty much exactly my view point. I really like the world, the mobs, the gameplay and whatnot, but I just couldn't get past it being an open lobby type thing. Still bums me out lol
How about best of both worlds? A single player based game where people can pop in and out, plus a hub area with multiplayer content where you can take your character. Like GTA online-ish except they would share the same character.
You described the problem with multiplayer games quite expertly.   


I think the inherent problem with a massively multiplayer focused game is that they make use of MMO conventions... most of which are terrible mechanics that MMOs should never have done in the first place. Various  mechanics designed to make it take an absurd amount of time to do things. Enemies that respawn within seconds. Slow movement designed to make it take much longer than necessary or realistic to get from one place to the next. Microtransactions designed to alleviate the grind at the cost of sweet sweet green. etc.  


The point of multiplayer has always been not to provide players more content, but to have the players themselves provide the content. If you're running around yakking with your friends while taking on some boss, you're less likely to notice or care that there's next to no real story taking place. Singleplayer games have to have content in place for the player, but with multiplayer the player you're fighting with or alongside can just... be the content. More accurately, there's zero reason for the devs not to provide the content in a multiplayer game, but why bother when the players will do all the work for them?  


It's shallow and pointless.
Thanks for typing it. That's pretty insightful, and makes tremendous sense.
This is a great way to put it, and I completely agree. I think borderlands handles multiplayer very well where when someone hops into your game, they up the difficulty/level of enemies to compensate, but otherwise the gameplay remains largely unchanged, and it's more that first scenario where the host is advancing a story and changing the world. I haven't played baldurs gate, but it looks great, and knowing it's that first type as well definitely seals the deal for me as I want to play that with my gf. 

I'm all in on that first type, and the way you explained the second type is probably why I've never really liked those games. It all feels hollow and nothing ever really changes.
    My fiancée and I have been going through BG3 exclusively in co-op mode, and it’s been an amazing time. Highly recommended, even if it’s a bit daunting using all the fine details with a controller (dual keyboard and mouse isn’t possible on split screen mode).
There is another POSSIBLE approach, but it's expensive and technically complex.  Break the game into major chapters.  Give the story a couple major inflection points, and have a cluster of game servers running for each stage of the story progression.  In FO75, I'd have 2 sets of servers.  One before you deal with the scorched queen and one for after.
I think the option for private servers would have been nice, but I don't know how feasible it would be for a game of this scope. And it still would not solve the problems you pointed out with how single boss fights and story progression are handled. One really nice thing about most fallout games is the environmental story telling. I think maybe they could have leaned a lot more heavily into that to find some kind of middle ground with terminals, notes, etc that can still be found by everyone playing in that game instance without having to rely on them having to all be on at the same time. But then again you'd have to miss out on creating meaningful encounters or, as you said, have them watered down with endless respawns. I hadn't thought about a lot of the issues you pointed out with regards to creating a multi-player rpg, so it does give me a good perspective. Thanks for the information!
The analysis of multiplayer vs massive multiplayer is spot on, but I disagree about the player not having impacts and being rewarded. Unlocks, leveling up, better gear, etc. can all be tied to characters and handed out as rewards. They're the usual RPG staples.

As for impacts, it's not going to be on a massive scale, but between characters and specifics? Absolutely. The use of instances, interior environments that are exclusive to the player/party, means simultaneous a d opposing choices can be made on individual scales.

The repetition also provides a safety net that's really needed when open ended RPGs become multiplayer. Imagine if Fallout 4 had multiplayer crowbarred into it. You're going to talk to Desdamona and join the Railroad when your buddy thinks it would be funny to open fire. Well, guess that questline is gone forever. ...Oops!

Even the big stuff from single player games are eventually flattened by the series itself. The Vault Dweller? Open in Fallout, flattened by Fallout 2. The Lone Wanderer? Open in Fallout 3, flattened by Fallout 4. All that's fluid turns solid eventually.
They could add a whole single player option and maybe even mod support while keeping the open world multiplayer from the second scenario as a base ‘get on and piss away a few hours after work or school or cause you’re bored” but also have a game mode that is more driven towards a single person, or a main character in a group of people on a more story driven, still open world style similar to the other fallout games, just with the option of playing it multiplayer. So many other games use the single main character multiplayer party style and it has been around for a long time, so I would’ve thought that would’ve been the choice for 76
Loved the rant, so don't apologise. 😃


Ironically, you just described Nuclear Winter in option 2 mechanics wise. And Bethesda removed that option (much to the disappointment of many). Because the chimera that is 76 is the lowest common denominator of both worlds. And somehow makes them a considerable amount of money.
I may have go get on and give it another go. I honestly can't say what about the open lobby style turned me away from it, I just had a hard time getting into real good because of it.
    So there's a bunch of people coming back like right now, and are overjoyed in love with it.

Enter in the last time you played and it should show you everything you missed and what's new. 

I don't know if you have an Xbox or if your PC is pretty good, but Xbox Gamepass has the whole fallout series. I'm pretty sure you can get two weeks for $1.
        I have it for Xbox, but have gotten to where I primarily play everything on PC over the past year. Thanks for the link. I'm gonna check it out again and see if I can get into it this time.
Once you get a feel for what you're doing and what you actually need it's really not that bad. I can't remember the last time I've actually had to go out and grind materials and I have several hundred hours in the game.
    As a self-confessed hoarder this was tough to learn for F76, but worth it.

I realised that if I capped myself to holding no more than about 100 of each resource I had more than enough to build anything, anytime.  Slight exception for ammo crafting materials, but if I needed to build a new CAMP, not a problem.

And as you say, you quickly learn where to go to replenish if you run low.

Selling spare crafting materials in my personal vendor also provided a steady income.
Yeah, that was a big factor for me. I enjoy hoarding materials so that when I end up going full tilt on building a base or something I don't have to go hunting for stuff every 5 minutes.
Because it isn't a PvP centric game
The only multiplayer it really requires is a constant connection to a server , other than that it can be treated and played like any other SP Fallout game . 

I feel like most of the people who make these posts havent really ever bothered with the game to begin with and give opinions based of what they heard 5 years ago
    To some extent, I'm the person you're describing.  I'm not hanging onto any old opinions of the game, but knowing that the server connection is required feels dirty, kind of like where Blizzard took the Diablo series.  Even if I never encounter another soul, knowing that I'm not truly alone is (admittely, irrationally) kind of annoying.

That said, I do intend to play the game one of these days, and I expect I'll thoroughly enjoy it, but I've also been trying to vote with my dollars to some extent by putting it off this long.
        I avoided it at launch but picked it up about a year later for £6.  I then got a good 600+ hours out of it, with most of that time playing essentially solo, just in an online world with other players.

There are some things you adapt your playstyle for - you can't hoard everything you ever found being the hardest for me - but as far as other player interaction it was often only seeing other people in well travelled areas like merchants or big world events.
You don’t have to move your house, if someone else is in your CAMP spot, you can just switch to a different CAMP, or switch servers

It’s not usually a problem unless you pick one of the more popular spots, like the ones near the Whitespring
That issue has been fixed for years
    Seems like most of the complaints are back in year 1 when it was very rough and lacking lots of content; it's much better now. Seriously impressed at all the QOL they put into fixing the little things.
    I didn't play the game at all until a few months ago.
        If that's the case, then you didn't HAVE to move your house, the game notifies you that your camp can't be placed on that world due to another players camp being there, and you can simply leave that server and join one where your camp can be placed
            Logging in and out of servers is so much fun/  

No thanks.
                Oh no, waiting a whole minute! Literally unplayable.
                    Why is it so important to defend the game to me? 

Am I not allowed to dislike 76?
                        You are. You're just wrong about some of the game's mechanics.
                            >You are.

It would very much seem otherwise.
You don't HAVE to move your home though. Nobody forced you to move it ...
    Yes but the alternative is logging out and then hoping that when I log back in the spot is available.  No thanks.
        You’re not going to play it I get that, but each account starts with two CAMP slots, typically what people do is build up both, then if one is blocked they can just deploy the second

I have a few CAMPs in popular spots, and never once had both blocked on the same server. 

Doing this takes just a few seconds on a bad day, and doesn’t interrupt the flow of the game at all

This information isn’t so much for you because it’s obvious you’re invested in not playing the game, but for anyone reading and thinking this might somehow be a barrier to playing or enjoying the game, when in fact for most people it’s a complete non issue
I guess Microsoft can be your scapegoat now?
    Being factually accurate is not scapegoating.
        So yea, you will be blaming Microsoft for all the bad decisions and praising Bethesda for all the success in your "Well... Ackually," replies.  

Never mind that the entire structure from capital to creatives is colloquially known as Bethesda, but you think being pedantic will mean that people don't know that the blame still falls on the group as a whole.  

I suppose the distinction makes you feel safer that the next single-player Bethesda game will be stunningly GOAT... said everyone before Starfield launched.
            I have been criticizing Bethesda directly since the game released. I was just complaining about the lack of dungeons in Starfield last week. You are talking out of your ass making strawman arguments.
I got fo76 for like 5 bucks, played it maybe once. good map, but I'd prefer (as dumb as it sounds) the gamebryo engine over whatever amalgam of the creation engine it uses. Better combat and such.
For sure.
Yeah they are pretty greedy. They could always just do more creation club or fallout 1st type stuff, but that probably wouldn’t be enough for them
That’s the point. I’m literally saying I’ve never played 76 because I want to play single player not multiplayer.
Not from what i heard.
    Yeah but you’re hearing it predominantly from people who either haven’t played it ever, haven’t played it since launch, and or just have a huge grudge that it exists at all
Sorry, I meant to say "pay to play". I was told there was the option to pay for a private server at some point. I could be totally wrong with that as I have ignored the game for a number of years.
