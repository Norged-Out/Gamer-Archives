[[Some Nagito problems]]





Idk why but this reminds me of MHA quirks
    Lol you're right. >! Hajime is like Midoriya !<
        But who would be the All Might in that situation?
And Nagito's a really... self hating, slightly nicer, Bakugo
            I'd argue hes probably a bit more than slightly nicer..just a lot more crazy..
                A bit more... problematic...
                    
In more ways than one. I think Bakugou is kinda problematic..just not in the same sense of the word as him
                        Yeah, I agree
                            Crazy or angry? You pick which is better
                                I mean, it's not really fair, I'd choose my second chaos son over anyone any day
                                    I'd choose chaos son over angry gremlin
                                    lol yes funny bagel son is the way
            NEKOMARU, duh
            *Cough cough*
**“NEKUOMARUUUUUUUUUUUUU NIDAIIIIIIIIIIII”**
            Makoto is All Might.
            All Might is Izuru Kamakura
                Makes sense
            Nagito is nothing like Bakugo
                The only thing they really have in common is the 'you don't have a quirk/talent, you freaking loser' thing
            Fuyohiko?
            His surgeon.
        Nah, he’s the highest end nomu
        Makoto fits him better.
            >! In the dr3 anime, Hajime doesn't have any talent yet he wants to enter Hope's Peak. Then he becomes The Ultimate hope and gains every talent with an unfair way. Sorry for bad english !<
                Yes I know that. I was just talking about the personalities. And you have great English!

                    My bad, I wanted to say "abnormal way"
          Then who all might
        ive always thought of hajime as kendo and nagito as monoma from class1B, i think the annoying+totally done attitudes are funny lol, although the hajime as midoriya thing makes sense
    Part of why I got into MHA was cause it was kinda like DR
    Hope's peak was ua all along
That means he solves problems
    Not problems like what is beauty, because that would fall within your conundrums of philosophy
        He solves practical problems
            For instance, how is he gonna stop some big mean mother hubbard from tearing him a structurally superfluous new behind?
                the answer? use a gun, and if that dont work? use more gun
                     Take for instance this heavy caliber tripod mounted lil' old number designed by me, built by me,
                        And you best hope... Not. Pointed at you... *tf2 music*
                            *scout soldier and demo man screams in the background as they get gunned down*

Looks like a cinnamon roll-

Tbf this is actually what happened with Sonias talent lol
Dispenser comin up
    Uncle Dane intro
Yea cause I was born a swimmer. I didn’t practice for 7 years for my times in breast I was born with that ability
    But you probably couldn't be the Ultimate Swimmer. Someone else who was born with more talent than you, and practiced for 7 years as well, would be a better swimmer than you
        Ouch. I actually used to be faster then my friend but now she’s like one of the fastest swimmer on the team so she wasn’t born with her talent.
    The [Polgar sisters](https://productiveclub.com/polgar-sisters-story/) settled this debate a long time ago. It's a shame more people don't know about them and keep repeating the same defeatist mantra.
        This was interesting. But the daughters reminded me f Nagisa. Kinda just an experiment.
            I get that. But by all accounts, it does seem like they are a pretty loving family.
                Yea
I mean ofc, being skilled isn't the same as being talented, the definition of talent is being naturally good at something.
    Well yes, but no. Talent means you acquire certain abilities more easily. But like skill, it still takes a lot of doing to actually become good.
        exactly and Talent is mostly genetic at the end of the day Talent isn't the be all end all which Nagito didn't really realize.
        you're both technically right depending on the definition
I think he says that the motivation to train to become great is something you are born with, cus there are  many people in dr2 that practiced a lot, like kazuichi, nekomaru, peko etc
    Doubt it, >!he really went 180 on Hajime when he learned that Hajime is a Reverse Course studen!<
        >! Yeah but that was also when he learned the Hajime was a terrorist !<
            >!Well, everyone was a terrorist but he was mostly focused on Hajime!<
                >! He was being rude to everyone. Well unlike the others Hajime was a terrorist AND talentless.  Nagito literally tells Hajime that he’s fond of him in the same chapter aswell !<
        Well yeah, but he hasn't really been training either
"He's about to say his first words!!a" 

"S...s....SPAH'S SAPPIN MAH SENTREH"
congratulations, it's a fanfic writer 😕
Not my fault I was born a gamer
He is talking about people like >!Junko, Kyoko, Ultimate Impostor, Fuyuhiko, Sonia, and Himself!<
    I just want to thank you for saying "Ultimate Impostor" instead of Byakuya.
    > Kyoko

Does Kyoko count? She was trained from a young age by her grandfather. She wasn't necessarily born with detective abilities.
        Yes but she was in a family with a long line of detectives and was expected to become a detective
            Well, that's still nurture rather than nature.
TBH, it has more to do with DR universe, than with Nagito.  
Don't worry, >!DRv3 fixed this!<.
    How so? I'm interested.
        Ok, beware of MASSIVE SPOILERS

>!As for the "universe thing" I mean that talents work differently in DR universe compared to how they work in real life (I'm specifically not using "our universe" word, because it's implied to be the same one ;D, but I'll get to that later).!<

>!In DR, a person can be born with an intrinsic talent that can be developed during their life. However, in order to become truly an Ultimate, one needs to be born with talent - as in DR,  a talent will triumph over pure determination.!<

>!In DRv3, however, it turns out that everything starting from DR Zero up to DR3 anime was fictional. It was basically what DR was in our world - a fictional game. It, however, was so popular that it spawned a genre of reality show based on DR, essentially a real life killing game. In our universe, in real life, yeah.!<

In other words,

>!there's no Santa Claus!<

>!there's no Tooth Fairy!<

>!AND THERE'S NO NAGITO KOMAEDA!<

>!Which ultimately means that all this obsession with "talents" was a matter of fiction, while in real life (where DRv3 takes place) talents work no differently than how they work... in real life.!<
I was born a fencer and sfx artist. Definitely never sucked at it or had to work on it. Ive never EVER lost a tournament, and i made my first prosthetic at 1 year old.
    [deleted]
        Oh yeah. I grabbed the scalpel and started stabbing the doctor and yelling, "en gaurd!"
Nagito spittin some facts doe- I cant be an eagle trainer when i become 22...because I was born with it!
Hey look Nagito, I'm an Engineer and that means I solve problems.
Deploy a dispenser here!
I'm in engineering rn, I guess its a waste of time then...
Engineer gaming
Engineer?

Is that a new gender?

I wonder if Sonia is Engineersexual.
    no, shes engineerphobic
        Poor Kazuichi...
I didn’t spend 5 years practicing art, I was simply born with it
    Having a natural aptitude (Talent) for something doesn't == being good at it.
Doctor when I was born: "Congrats! She is completely useless. She still can make some sounds on the violin though"
    oh jeez-
Like Keebo and Sonia, emm 
Talented just for existing
Given how they treat Ultimates in that world he might as well be right in that case.
so is this why i main engineer in TF2?
kamukura punching the air rn
That's not the only problem.👀

A lot of artis were probably pissed when they heard that!

*Okay but as an Asian this is so true it pains me ouch-*
TBF, Old Asian Parents decides what your profession should be since birth.
Ah yess the moment I was shot out the pussy I immediately began shredding Van Halen with my fat ass baby fingers
I was born a rocket scientist, and I created a way to go to the outer planets when I was still a fetus.
meme aside Talent is your natural aptitude for something.  
Some people will have a talent for math or physical works etc decided by birth via their genes.  


That of course doesn't mean you can't work hard to be better than those with natural talent but well yeah.

&#x200B;

So Nagito wasn't wrong many people are born with talents its up to them to discover where their talents lie and if their talents aren't in the area of their interests for them to work hard to make up for the lack of talent.
    I'm kind of sad theres only like 3 comments in this section that seem to get this
    Talent, in and of itself, is useless, though, cause it's not how good you *are* at something, it's how good you *could* be. I wish Nagito could get that, and the fact that neither talent nor skill determine someone's worth as a person, through his thick skull.

I do actually wonder how Nagito would feel about someone like >!Yui Samidare!< from DR: Kirigiri. >!She had a natural talent for jumping, to the point where Jin Kirigiri offered her a place at Hope's Peak as the Ultimate High Jumper, but she rejected the offer to continue her work as a detective.!<
Baby Kazuichi is kinda cute
Congratulations. He is a Fanfic Creator.
He just needs a bit more gun
Geniuses are born, not created
I do yet don't feel this at the same time.

I feel like a failure, but I know I succeed a lot more than most people.

I know I have room to grow, but I still feel hopeless, and like since I haven't come out of the womb drawing wonderfully, cooking with prestige, etc, that I won't ever.
I especially struggle with that now, alot, since im nearing the end of my "growth period" before i have to start applying this to true work.
My life is making more sense 😲
Congratulations! Its the ultimate impostor!
    /u/AlksGurin, I have found an error in your comment:

 > “~~Its~~ [**It's**] the ultimate”

It might be better if you, AlksGurin, had said “~~Its~~ [**It's**] the ultimate” instead. ‘Its’ is possessive; ‘it's’ means ‘it is’ or ‘it has’.

        Wtf that was instant
ERECTIN' A DISPENSER
Engineer gaming
DAMN IT I WANTED A POP STAR
Yep! they knew right when I was born that I would be the ultimate disaster.
Bro, it's (Persona 4 spoilers) >!Hajime that has the voice of Adachi!<, not you
DUCKIMJDAMS
I think he means natural talent which lets people get better at things way easier on some things, like how you could be a natural swimmer. Of course you can learn to swim good but those with talent will always be ahead of you
“Geniuses are born not created”
Indian parents be like:
kinda true (sonia, fuyuhiko, kaede in a way)
Is this Adachi?
H O P E
nil dr is really unrealistic
Bro got that fixed mindset 💀
Lol you're right. >! Hajime is like Midoriya !<
    But who would be the All Might in that situation?
And Nagito's a really... self hating, slightly nicer, Bakugo
        I'd argue hes probably a bit more than slightly nicer..just a lot more crazy..

I get that. But by all accounts, it does seem like they are a pretty loving family.
    Yea

A bit more... problematic...
    
In more ways than one. I think Bakugou is kinda problematic..just not in the same sense of the word as him

                    I'd choose chaos son over angry gremlin
                    lol yes funny bagel son is the way
Makes sense

Yes I know that. I was just talking about the personalities. And you have great English!
