[[I was just thinking how the hell did Hagakure get into hopes peak high school with 30% accurate fortune telling]]





Because that 30% is 100% accurate when it does happens. No matter how unlikely the outcome could look.
    30% of the time, it works every time
        What I said was that the 30% of the time the prediction is correct. And when that happens, the prediction itself is 100% accurate to what Hiro said would happen. No matter how unlikely it could sound.
            Ohhh ok, I was just making a little joke. Ever seen Anchorman?
                Not really
        Seems legit
        Hope's Peak Academy: yep sounds about right
    So if Yasuhiro says that a cat will jump out of a tree while I'm walking home at 12:57 in the morning, land on my head, rip out exactly 36 strands of hair from it, hiss one time and leave, there's a 30% chance that those events will happen exactly the way he said it?
        Yeah, pretty much.
    How he failed to predict a single murder is odd though, he had an 88% chance of getting atleast one correct. I'm honestly surprised Junko didn't try to manipulate the situation to get Hagakure killed off quickly because he had a 30% chance to just guess that, Junko was in fact Mukuro in disguise, Junko was still alive, and that she was the mastermind. He had the ability to ruin the whole game for her and she just didn't care.

Edit: it's an 88% chance rather than 83%
        That’s not really fortune telling or future seeing, though.
            So he wasn't able to just see the big reveal that happened at the end.
                Because the big reveal was just talking about events that had already happened
        I personally suspect she put something in the food/water to make everyone substantially less intelligent except for Kyoko and Makoto.

So the idea to use fortune telling to divine the culprit or mastermind just never comes to Yasuhiro’s head, and the rest of the characters don’t really believe him so never bring it up.
            That's certainly reasonable, he probably also doesn't want to be the cause of getting them all killed by accusing someone who's innocent.
        What would cause her more despair than the game being ruined? The game had to have a chance to fail for that sweet, sweet despair.
        At the end Ch3 (or beginning of Ch4) he predicts that no more *murders* will happen, which is technically true 😫
        Where did you get the 83% from?
            I have no idea why I wrote that number, let me fix that real quick.

The correct number is 88% because of a probability formula, simply the chance that he guessed 1-6 of the 6 murders given that he has a 30% chance of guessing a single murder correctly gives and 88% chance.
Because being super detailed about a specific event is cool af, even if it’s only 3/10 times
    >!Was cool of him to even guess correctly that there will be no more murders!<
        >!And if you get the bad ending, where you could interpret Kyoko as being murdered, he instead guesses correctly about him and Makoto having kids with the same mother!<.
            I like how in that ending >!Tohko just dies with no explanation!<
                I think someone even asked Kodaka, >!and he said “She blew up or something”!<
                    Yeah and Byakuya is smiling while holding her >!death portrait!<
                        “Thank god I don’t have to make excuses to not fuck that bitch”
                            >!*Mikan enters the chat*!<
                            Byakuya wrong for this😔
                        why is this so funny for me 😭
                    king
                    Based
                    She explode binded
                I think it's because she's the one taking the picture so she wasn't in it
                \*explode\*
            And there's a 33% chance to get the ending he predicted since it comes after picking one of three options, which ties back into the 30-something % chance of accuracy
            I forgot about that lmfao
        This made me mad when I realized that lmao
    I wonder if he predicted 9/11
        Can't you read? He predicts 3/10.
            Fair lol
        How is that the first thing you thought of.
            Wdym
Cuz that still made him the most accurate clairvoyant in the world. 

real fortune tellers work their "magic" by doing tons of background research and psychological tricks. Yasuhiro just goes with his gut and is right 30% of the time. pretty damn impressive.
Hagakure said it himself. Compared to practically every other psychic, mystic, fortune teller, clairvoyant, and medium in the practice? 30% success rate in making accurate predictions is exceptional. Phenomenal even, considering almost nobody else even makes it into the double digits. Well beyond statistical variance and way more successful than random guesses or coincidence.
    Also it is suggested that there is *some* truth to his incredible claims.  >!He successfully predicted nobody else would be murdered after the execution of Celeste and indeed nobody was. Sakura’s death was a suicide, the blown up body was Mukuro’s corpse, Makoto survived his execution, and the last trial was a re-trial. Also if you count the alt ending then Hagakure was right about Makoto’s, Byakuya’s, and his children all having the same mother.!<
        In his novel it’s shown that he wasn’t lying at all. It’s even a really cool sequence where he >!predicts his own near death experience. !<If he can somehow train his ability to even 50% accuracy it could be really powerful.
            Why not just predict a thing won't happen, giving it a 70% chance to happen?  Instant win
                You mean, "You will not die being eaten by a wild animal", for example?

If it comes from his mouth, it will still be a prediction with 30% accuracy, so no.

Still, it makes the prediction "You will die this way" 70% accurate, so you are maybe somewhat right, though.
                    I guess so.

It's a good thing you aren't clairvoyant, though, because I do panic about stuff like being attacked by animals...
                        My apologies. I didn't put a lot of thoughts into the example...
Because they were vividly accurate in how he described them
In a world where this stuff exists and most are pretty garbage at it, 30% is pretty damn good
Reminds me of that girl of Mob Psycho. It is pretty damn impressive and useful that 3 out of 10 guesses you make, no matter how specific, are 100% true. That's what makes him an ultimate, that his guesses aren't something vague like the usual fortune teller "you will make a great step forward". He will say something as: "You will get out of your car, bump into a shady guy, that will pickpocket you, but when you reach your workplace you will get promoted. That will be tomorrow" and that has a 30% chance to be true
30% accuracy is still pretty impressive
Being completely accurate 30% of the time is actually really high
It's always 30% for certain, while for most other clairvoyants it changes anywhere from 0-100%
30% is a lot if you think about it, if he predicts a tragedy or death, you can do anything to avoid it and there's a big chance it will save your life.
Because 30% accuracy probably is the best anyone’s ever gotten
I think it's a small joke that, even if he's only 30% accurate, he's still the best in the world at it
    It doesn't matter how good you are at it, as long as it's better by just 1%.
        Even at 1% its pretty impressive.

All he has to do is predict the lottery numbers a a few hundred times and make bank.
He was called "Supernova" by the clairvoyant community, remember? Even if 30% sounds lame as hell, that's ridiculously accurate compared to everyone else. Presumably, that's enough to mark Hiro as actually having genuine supernatural abilities, as opposed to getting lucky by asking the right vague, leading questions like really "fortune-tellers" do
Bro if it’s 30% he’s just gotta predict it three times and there’s only a 10% chance he’s wrong 🤯
    Good luck figuring out which of the 3 outcomes will happen lol
Because Dan Avidan has a side-gig as a lead singer and internet sensation, and Hopes Peak DESPERATELY needed something to boost their public image, so they sent him an invite under the guise of “ultimate clairvoyant.”
    He also couldn't be the Ultimate Pop Idol because they already had someone for that role...
you'd be surprised by how accurate that actually is.
For the same reason Byakuya got into Hope's Peak by having the talent of waiting for his dad to die so he can claim inheritance
    >!That is not how Byakuya inherited the Togami family wealth nor how he inherited the Togami corporation.!<
    That is not how he inherited the corporation 😭
        I know, >!he competed in the Togami Family Olympics,!< but saying his talent is waiting to claim inheritance is funnier
    I kinda understand why Bykuya got in I mean out of him and his 14 half-siblings he proved he was the most worthy to inherit the togami conglomerate being the head of a single company is hard Enough  but an entire conglomerate that takes good management reasoning and intelligence to do so yeah he's worthy of his place in hopes peak
        He's basically the Seto Kaiba of Danganronpa.
            That's actually the most accurate description of bykuya I've ever seen
30% is the best they could find, and he provides lots of information
ultimate rizz
30% of the time he is 100% accurate. This could mean one of two things:
1. Haha fortune telling is bad - could just be a joke that fortune telling is stupid and extremely in accurate.
2. Regardless of how stupid his prediction is, there’s almost a 1/3 chance that it is exactly right - which is phenomenal foresight and even then for the other 7/10 times he might be kinda right just not 100%

30% of the time his predictions are perfect - doesn’t necessarily mean his other predictions are wrong, just not perfect.
    > Haha fortune telling is bad - could just be a joke that fortune telling is stupid and extremely in accurate.

It's pretty much this as far as I understood it. 30% success rate doesn't sound that great, but when compared to other fortune tellers who are normally just con artists and don't have real clairvoyance at all, it's actually incredible.
Because that is 30% more accurate than usual scammer...sorry I mean liar...ahem "clairvoyant" yeah that
That's way better than any other "psychic" irl
He’s the *most* accurate fortune teller there is. Hope’s Peak doesn’t just examine exceptional skill, they also examine who is the best at something.
I think the joke was that fortune tellers are all scammers, so 30% is an insanely high success rate.
A 30% success rate is still pretty high for something like clairvoyance. And it's not like HPA is picky when it comes to accepting Ultimates.
How accurate is your fortune-telling?

If I could fly, but only 3 inches off the ground, that’s still better than anyone else can, even though it doesn’t have much practical use
    I'd rather fly 3 inches and anyone how could do that would probably get on to hopes peak easily
        My point was that even if your talent is underwhelming, it’s still a talent as long as you are the best at whatever it is that you do

If a guy can fly 3 inches off the ground, he’s definitely deserving of an invite to Hope’s Peak just as long as nobody can beat 3 inches. And if a guy can predict the future 30% of the time, he’s definitively deserving of an invite to Hope’s Peak just as long as nobody can beat 30%.
            Is that underwhelming though? I’ll never get muddy boot’s again!
                How much does muddy boots affect your life now?

I’d rather know the winning numbers to 30% of lottery drawings than never have to buy new shoes
Idk, I kinda just assumed that most fortune tellers were less accurate, that and not the age required to get into the school
    Well if Danganronpa is like our world with regards to psychics, most other psychics are effectively charlatans that use manipulation and very careful leading questions to con people.

The implication is that Yasuhiro’s 30% are legitimate predictions of which he had no prior background about the client, was very exact and precise with regards to the prediction, and was verified through an impartial 3rd party. If so, 30% is INSANELY good and would probably have governments involved for researching legitimate psychic phenomenon
 Could you turn the 30% in 100%? Because 30% he is 100% right with his answer, if you have enough money can you keep paying him asking about the same thing and you get a confirmed correct answer by going with the answer that is the most consistent. This would be huge as with enough time you could learn almost anything you wanted to ask him.
Let's see you do better
Think about it this way:

If you saw someone you never met and had to make an extremely accurate, extremely detailed description about their future would you get it right? There's probably around a 0%-3% chance that your detailed fortune would come true. Now compare that to a 30% chance that he gets. Again, he gets 30% chance for an extremely detailed and accurate fortune for people he just met.
30% is pretty high all things considered, especially since what he does predict is rather specific. >!Notice how both the predictions he makes end up right? The killings stop after Case 3 and in the bad ending him and Makoto’s children have the same mother.!<
I guess every other high schooler is less than 30% accurate
Maybe they interviewed three other fortune tellers 🤔
Because when there are two possiblyties if one of them is 30% correct, you can choose other one!
30% of the time it works 100% of the time
They needed an Ultimate Weed Smoker.
I counter your question with this question, how many Fortune Tellers are there that have an accurate percentage rate that high? Like when the people your competing with only have a 10-15% accuracy (and thats being generous!) Then 30% is pretty dang ultimate.
30% is a lot more than literally everyone else in the world with 0%😂
I always thought it was accurate to real life psychics lol
Hagakure has some of the highest accuracy rates in fortune telling. Most don't have an accuracy rate over 12%.
They just be letting anybody in there that school is full of clowns
    Ultimate clown 🤡🤡🤡
Because that’s incredibly high.
Being the best in the world at fortune telling doesn't require anything close to perfection.
    Still there's lots of talent in the danganronpa universe could have picked  someone else
        This is the *78th* class. Assuming that every class prior also had 16 students, we have 77*16 = 1232 students that came before them. At some point, some less concrete talents are bound to be picked to join Hope's Peak.
I wondered the same, he’s not even good at his talent
Goes to show other danganronpa psychics are just really fucking terrible at being psychic.
He still isn’t nearly as talented as everyone else, but 30 percent is impressive.

Makoto is still far more talented then him.
    Yes agreed brother
Even with actual math and statistics you can only make somewhat basic predictions, and you need usually a lot of data, the fact that Hagakure can predict shit out of his ass and it is correct an outstanding 30% of the times is nothing below fucking amazing. But yeah, the downside of his talent is that you really never know when he is talking pure trash and when he is actually predicting something.

But even then if his predictions have a 30% of probability of being right, then there is a 70% probability that they are wrong, and this can actually be more useful in certain scenarios, like if there is a basketball game Lakers vs Celtics and Hagakure guesses Lakers, then there is a 70% chance he is wrong and Celtics win, and while 70% is still pretty risky, it is definitely better than relying on his 30% guesses.
Because he's just that guy. He's the YasuHIMro HaGOATkure. That's why.

(but in all seriousness, I think its due to the fact that the 30% of success rate is extremely good considering the low success rates of many fortune tellers and later it's explained that he can see what appears to be rather detailed visions of possible future events)
30% chance of being correct is miles better than actual "fortune tellers" who's chances would be less than 5%

We've seen in the novel that his power is actually legitimate.
It’s still more accurate than other fortune tellers.
It’s mostly because of how specific it is. Most fortune tellers are like “OoOoOo…YoU wIlL tAkE a LeAp Of FaItH” while he is like “you will wake up and trip on your left shoe and twist your ankle tomorrow at 8:00”
I think he said his fortune telling is more accurate than most other fortune tellers, so it makes him an Ultimate by default
Because with the way fortune telling works 30% is a very high success rate for the ability 😭
I think it's been stated Kyoko's dad (who was in charge at the time) was really dumb.
every other fortune teller has an accuracy rate of 29% and lower
30% more than most people can do
A flat 30% is amazing. 30% chance to know the lottery numbers? Hell yeah.
The idea is that he is among the best fortune tellers in the world. Apparently everyone else is even worse.
Because his 30% is still more useful than white girls charging $80 on Facebook for tarot readings.
Bc Most irl fortune tellers have 1-5% accurate telling
many phony fortune tellers are intentionally vague and general, so more stuff could be interpreted as their prediction being true. It's like horoscopes or video game leaks.

But very very specific and unlikely predictions, even if they're not nearly as consistent, are more impressive than broad ones that can apply to anything
Imagine if you could pick winning lottery tickets with 30% accuracy...
Bro he's reading Junko's fortune and she's there praying for the other 70% like 😅
You and I are gonna have children from the same woman Makoto
I don't remember exactly, but I think in his last free time event he admits he actually sneaked in Hope's Peak. Like, he's not an actual student. That's why he was three years older than everyone else. Even if he's talent is real, he's just a swindler
    Okay so I looked it up and I remembered correctly. He literally says :
"But they caught up to me, of course.
They tried to force me to pay them...well, more than I could afford. So I snuck my way into Hope's Peak...
The instant I leave this school, they're gonna come for my guts! Black market organs are in huge demand!
But I love my organs! I don't wanna give 'em to someone else!"
Plot
Honestly, they probably noticed that his skills were good but did need some work. They probably tested him in ways in which there were three or more options, and all within a minute or two. They probably figured with training at this special school they could knock it up to 50% (which isn't much when you're going 50/50, but it's WAY more impressive when there are way more possibilities of failure)
I mean 30% is still better than 0% accuracy
All the other high-schoolers had a 10% accurate fortune telling.
He met up with one of the guys of the Steering Committee and predicted to him the numbers of the lottery or something along those lines.
Because funni
Akane Owari is even better by the way.

Throughout the game, he guts were never wrong.
Because he's the best fortune teller
    I would've been here earlier but timezones suck and I just woke up
Because he's the one who has his rate as high
Because it actually can work.  It’s likely extremely difficult just to get real vague readings.
Bro has a talent we don’t know about prolly
He predicted he would get in
All the other bozos have a 29% accuracy.
Koichi Kizakura is the reason Idk why but he just invite him to the school
Because everyone that fortune tells just hits 0-29% accuracy
Pure swag
he gave the interviewer a blunt
Luck
It is kinda silly, but he did get something right. I think it was chapter 4 when he said that "there will be no murders from here on out" or something. >!He was right. Sakura died from suicide, Mukuro was already dead before chapter 5, and there was no murder at all in chapter 6. So although there were 2 deaths, there was no murder!<
Can you predict 30% of the future? Didn’t think so.
Cuz he's yasuhiro who doesn't love him
I always thought it was the street cred he got from the clairvoyant community and some...'help' from Miss Hagukure.
Idk maybe that’s the highest %
Because that’s still 30% higher than the next highest accuracy.
as others have said it's because when that 30% hits, it gets every single thing right. He could predict a landslide that saves a person's life who would have been hit by a car because they weren't paying attention and if he got it right, the person wouldn't get it. idk why that's the example I thought of but it's basically just that. Atleast it's better than getting into the school for being super lucky
Dan Avidan?
I think it’s Hodaka’s way of saying fortune telling is a hoax, making the best fortune teller only a 30% chance of being right
So me and my friend like to joke that Koichi did it on purpose and recruited Hiro as a prank on the head master knowing he's likely not talented.
Because most fortune tellers have a 0% accurate telling... since they're all scammers.

30% is massive
Most people can’t even predict when it’s gonna rain
He's the very best at what he does. Doesn't mean that he is good.
How do you have worse odds then a coin flip 😭
it’s said the portion of his predictions that were accurate we’re spot on to an unbelievable amount, so that could be a part of the reason why
Name one fortune teller that has that high of an accuracy.
Because the others are even worse.
I don’t even know how the fuck he survived ngl..
30% of the time, it works every time
    What I said was that the 30% of the time the prediction is correct. And when that happens, the prediction itself is 100% accurate to what Hiro said would happen. No matter how unlikely it could sound.
        Ohhh ok, I was just making a little joke. Ever seen Anchorman?
            Not really
    Seems legit
    Hope's Peak Academy: yep sounds about right
So if Yasuhiro says that a cat will jump out of a tree while I'm walking home at 12:57 in the morning, land on my head, rip out exactly 36 strands of hair from it, hiss one time and leave, there's a 30% chance that those events will happen exactly the way he said it?
    Yeah, pretty much.
How he failed to predict a single murder is odd though, he had an 88% chance of getting atleast one correct. I'm honestly surprised Junko didn't try to manipulate the situation to get Hagakure killed off quickly because he had a 30% chance to just guess that, Junko was in fact Mukuro in disguise, Junko was still alive, and that she was the mastermind. He had the ability to ruin the whole game for her and she just didn't care.

Edit: it's an 88% chance rather than 83%
    That’s not really fortune telling or future seeing, though.
        So he wasn't able to just see the big reveal that happened at the end.

If a guy can fly 3 inches off the ground, he’s definitely deserving of an invite to Hope’s Peak just as long as nobody can beat 3 inches. And if a guy can predict the future 30% of the time, he’s definitively deserving of an invite to Hope’s Peak just as long as nobody can beat 30%.
        Is that underwhelming though? I’ll never get muddy boot’s again!
            How much does muddy boots affect your life now?

I’d rather know the winning numbers to 30% of lottery drawings than never have to buy new shoes
Well if Danganronpa is like our world with regards to psychics, most other psychics are effectively charlatans that use manipulation and very careful leading questions to con people.

The implication is that Yasuhiro’s 30% are legitimate predictions of which he had no prior background about the client, was very exact and precise with regards to the prediction, and was verified through an impartial 3rd party. If so, 30% is INSANELY good and would probably have governments involved for researching legitimate psychic phenomenon
Ultimate clown 🤡🤡🤡
Still there's lots of talent in the danganronpa universe could have picked  someone else
    This is the *78th* class. Assuming that every class prior also had 16 students, we have 77*16 = 1232 students that came before them. At some point, some less concrete talents are bound to be picked to join Hope's Peak.
Yes agreed brother
Okay so I looked it up and I remembered correctly. He literally says :
"But they caught up to me, of course.
They tried to force me to pay them...well, more than I could afford. So I snuck my way into Hope's Peak...
The instant I leave this school, they're gonna come for my guts! Black market organs are in huge demand!
But I love my organs! I don't wanna give 'em to someone else!"
I would've been here earlier but timezones suck and I just woke up
What I said was that the 30% of the time the prediction is correct. And when that happens, the prediction itself is 100% accurate to what Hiro said would happen. No matter how unlikely it could sound.
    Ohhh ok, I was just making a little joke. Ever seen Anchorman?
        Not really
Seems legit
Hope's Peak Academy: yep sounds about right
Yeah, pretty much.
That’s not really fortune telling or future seeing, though.
    So he wasn't able to just see the big reveal that happened at the end.
        Because the big reveal was just talking about events that had already happened
I personally suspect she put something in the food/water to make everyone substantially less intelligent except for Kyoko and Makoto.

So the idea to use fortune telling to divine the culprit or mastermind just never comes to Yasuhiro’s head, and the rest of the characters don’t really believe him so never bring it up.
    That's certainly reasonable, he probably also doesn't want to be the cause of getting them all killed by accusing someone who's innocent.
What would cause her more despair than the game being ruined? The game had to have a chance to fail for that sweet, sweet despair.
At the end Ch3 (or beginning of Ch4) he predicts that no more *murders* will happen, which is technically true 😫
Where did you get the 83% from?
    I have no idea why I wrote that number, let me fix that real quick.

The correct number is 88% because of a probability formula, simply the chance that he guessed 1-6 of the 6 murders given that he has a 30% chance of guessing a single murder correctly gives and 88% chance.
>!And if you get the bad ending, where you could interpret Kyoko as being murdered, he instead guesses correctly about him and Makoto having kids with the same mother!<.
    I like how in that ending >!Tohko just dies with no explanation!<
        I think someone even asked Kodaka, >!and he said “She blew up or something”!<
            Yeah and Byakuya is smiling while holding her >!death portrait!<
                “Thank god I don’t have to make excuses to not fuck that bitch”
                    >!*Mikan enters the chat*!<
                    Byakuya wrong for this😔
                why is this so funny for me 😭

            She explode binded
        I think it's because she's the one taking the picture so she wasn't in it
        \*explode\*
    And there's a 33% chance to get the ending he predicted since it comes after picking one of three options, which ties back into the 30-something % chance of accuracy
    I forgot about that lmfao
This made me mad when I realized that lmao
Can't you read? He predicts 3/10.
    Fair lol
How is that the first thing you thought of.
    Wdym
In his novel it’s shown that he wasn’t lying at all. It’s even a really cool sequence where he >!predicts his own near death experience. !<If he can somehow train his ability to even 50% accuracy it could be really powerful.
    Why not just predict a thing won't happen, giving it a 70% chance to happen?  Instant win
        You mean, "You will not die being eaten by a wild animal", for example?

If it comes from his mouth, it will still be a prediction with 30% accuracy, so no.

Still, it makes the prediction "You will die this way" 70% accurate, so you are maybe somewhat right, though.
            I guess so.

It's a good thing you aren't clairvoyant, though, because I do panic about stuff like being attacked by animals...
                My apologies. I didn't put a lot of thoughts into the example...
Even at 1% its pretty impressive.

All he has to do is predict the lottery numbers a a few hundred times and make bank.
I know, >!he competed in the Togami Family Olympics,!< but saying his talent is waiting to claim inheritance is funnier
He's basically the Seto Kaiba of Danganronpa.
    That's actually the most accurate description of bykuya I've ever seen
