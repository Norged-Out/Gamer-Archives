    True
Byakuya definitely rages when he loses

“How could I lose to a bunch of pathetic middle class peasants! This is bullshit!”
    That's why he doesn't play, can't take the risk
Himiko would just do magic with the cards.
    LOL! Make +4s outta nowhere
wait. celeste loses?
    No. No one knows how she does that and she keeps sitting in the same spot for a while afterwards, but SHE. NEVER. LOSES.
    It may be a card game, but it's not gambling

Plus I think it would be funny to think about her just getting +4d over and over
        i mean the gambling part is just putting money on things

celeste is just really good at card games, especially at manipulating those involving luck while also requiring skill, and i think uno fulfills those criteria

in any case, i dont think she'd be unlucky, even if she wasnt a guaranteed winner
            True, but there should be one game that she will hate forever
                probably chess

some thing pure strategy, with no mindgames
                    Chess absolutely has mindgames.
                    *two games that she will hate forever
Makoto would always end up winning because of how his luck works and like this said Nagito would start off the game lucky
    I'm not sure about that, but alrighty
        okay I take it back, but he has a high chance of winning
            Ye
Why did ya have to do Mondo dirty like that >!I mean considering why he killed!<
    I was thinking he would flip the table
Tenko: *flips the table* THAT DEGENERATE MALE WAS CHEATING
    Nagito: *+4*
        Kokichi: :3
            Chiaki: o:
                Tenko: *proceeds to strangle Nagito and Kokichi*
                    Taka: tENKO STOP
                        Taka: __STRANGLING IS NOT WELCOME IN A SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT__

Mondo: *splits them* You heard my bro
                            Chihiro: Can we just play like normal??
                                Kazuichi: We can but Nagito should be banned from playing
                                    Angie: Atua has blessed me! *+4*
This seems pretty accurate ngl
    Yes
Leon: *plays the switch turns card*
    Nagito: *+4*
        Hajime: Nagito I swear there can't be THAT many of those in the deck
            Nagito: Guess I'm just lucky *+4*
                Hajime: *draws the cards murmuring curses*
                    Gonta: Hajime, why you draw from deck?
                        Hajime: Because Nagito is an ass
                            Gonta: Gonta don't understand
                                Tsumugi: Umm... just ignore them Gonta
                                    Gonta: Okay! *+4*
