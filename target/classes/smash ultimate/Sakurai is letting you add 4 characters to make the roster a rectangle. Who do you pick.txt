[[Sakurai is letting you add 4 characters to make the roster a rectangle. Who do you pick]]





Four more Marios. Not Paper Mario or M&L Mario or anything. Just copy/paste Mario four more times.
    More times implies that he is already in the game. Sakurai would never put Mario in.
        Who the fuck is Mario
            i think he's luigi's brother, from the first super luigi game on the nes. he's kind of obscure so i dont think he could get in
                AKA red Luigi
                    there's a reason I hold a love/hate relationship with this meme
            Chris Pratt.
                You mean Bob Hoskins?
            Wahoo
            You know how sometimes people are referred to by their last name? well luigis last name is Mario, so they're referring to luigi
            Everyone knows that Mario is cool as fuck.
        I know. Dr. Mario was easily the most-deserving inclusion in the entire game, but Regular Mario? GTFO, he's super-unimportant.
            I hate this meme
                I hate this world
                    I hate you
                        I hate your pet goldfish
                    I hate this universe

                            #
            Regular Mario is such a niche character like who honestly cares
    Look, we need more Mario alts.
        A propeller suit alt would be awesome.
    We totally need silver Mario! /s
        Pink gold peach for smash!
        Nah we need Gold Mario smh
            Oh, we can't go getting too greedy now
It's already a rectangle if you stack echos
    So then you can add 4 more echoes, so it's a rectangle both ways!
        Let's see:

* Alph as an Olimar Echo (no longer just an alt.)
* Impa as a Sheik Echo
* Octoling as an Inkling Echo
* Black Shadow as Captain Falcon/Ganondorf Echo?
            The lack of octolings as an alt for inkling is probably my biggest disappointment with the character
                It's easy to understand why there weren't any Octoling alts. for Inkling, because Inkling already has male and female alts. Adding Octoling on top of that would mean there'd only be 4 Inklings, and given how colorful and diverse Inklings can be in Splatoon, I think that was the smart choice.

Additionally, Octolings were really only basic enemies until Octo Expansion, where one of them (Agent 8) became playable in that story, before becoming playable in regular matches upon beating it. And Octo Expansion was most-likely released too late for Sakurai to even consider them as playable fighters.
                    I mean there’s 4 alts for Steve….
                        That’s different tho, the legacy edition Steve skins aren’t as sought after and they already got the best alts for Steve and Alex
                            Tuxedo was and still is my favorite Steve Alex skins
                    Just make one alt the male and one the female octoling and give them colors we don’t use yet.
                    Doesn’t little Mac have 16 alts
            black shadow with ganon moveset and then make ganon a real character
                That's what I was gonna say! Like honestly, remove Black Shadow swords and give them something more like what they'd have in F0 (I've never played or watched any of this game so idk). Give Ganon something that's far more Zelda inspired
                    The current moveset is ok. Falcon is also fully smash based. But change side special, flame choke is literally the only thing that's actually based out of something.
                        Doesn't he falcon punch in the anime?
                            The anime came after smash.
                        Yah, and I love the fact that the ganon we have is a heavy hitter that just feeeels like a villain, but it would be nice to have some Zelda inspired move sets. Maybe a magic ganon moveset and then a power based one?
                YES!!!!!
            I was thinking, Dry Bowser as a less heavy and “sharper” version of bowser would be cool, and iill tell you what I mean by “sharper”. So, he doesn’t deal more knockback on moves, maybe he even deals less, but he deals more damage nonetheless (the knockback is reduced so that it comes out even on average when damage is considered). If this didn’t work, I guess they could just make him lighter and more combo-reliant. I just like the idea of a lighter bowser as an echo
            We need Zack as a Cloud echo too
            ganondorf is already half a falcon echo so I don’t get that
                The common opinion is that it would be cool to have him as an echo that has basically ganondorf's moveset, and make ganon a new and more faithful moveset
                    Yep.

Ganon in the games isn't some lumbering oaf, he's deceptively quick and has sword play equal or superior to the Hero.
            Demise as ganon echo.

Sure he might only be the villain in one single zelda game but he’s also the start of the timeline and his evil spirit is what reincarnates into Ganondorf throughout the rest of the games so adding him as an echo to ganon would be perfect.

Tbh I’d want him to be a new character all together, but even if he was an echo I’d take it
        More than 4, but here's some ideas.

And I don't think Echoes should be between 2 unrelated series.

Shadow as a Sonic Echo.

Ms. Pac-Man as a Pac-Man Echo.

Jeanne as a Bayonetta Echo.

Ninten as a Ness Echo.

Impa as a Sheik Echo.

Funky Kong as a Donkey Kong Echo.

Proto Man as a Mega Man Echo.

Octoling as an Inkling Echo.

Raichu as Pikachu Echo (Same skeleton, but scaled up.)
            Honestly I'm still surprised some of these didn't get in. Many of them are really obvious, and would've required very little work.
        -Funky Kong as a DK Echo

-Ms PAC Man as a PAC Man Echo

-Birdo as a Yoshi Echo

-Big Boss as a Snake Echo
            I don't see how Birdo would work as a Yoshi echo. I'd replace them with Shadow as a Sonic Echo.
        Shadow as Sonics and his Homing Spin Attack can be Chaos Control and Shadow just dive kicks an enemy.

Proto man as Mega Man with different robot abilities. And a taunt to play his tune.

Zero as Cloud's echo cause he deserves it.

And I would like to see Tetra as Toon Links echo cause I think that would be fun.
        Or give every single character an Echo and force them to stack.
        And again I say, Ghost Dad King Rhoam as an echo on Pyra/Mythra
        Going with

- Funky Kong (Donkey Kong)
- Octoling (Inkling)
- Roxas (Sora)
- Knuckles as an echo of Little Mac don’t ask me to elaborate
        Let's see: 

Blaziken as a Capt Falcon Echo

Waluigi as a Wii Fit Echo 

Octoling as an Inkling Echo

Baby Mario & Baby Luigi as Ice Climber Echos
            > Waluigi as a Wii Fit Echo

So brave.

> Baby Mario & Baby Luigi as Ice Climber Echos

    fine dear, I'll listen to weekend whip _again_
The bandicoot, the lanky purple man, the sexy purple haired genie, and the fat guy that can’t kill sonic
    4 characters we desperately need
        What about Hank Hill
    Who's the purple haired genie?
        Shantae, haven’t personally played the games but I know a lot of people want her in, and it seems like there’s a decent moveset opportunity
            I want her sooooo bad
        The genie from Aladin, but with purple hair. Specifically Will Smiths rendition. Hope this helps.
        Gotcha, you want Coco Bandicoot, Purple Guy from FNAF, Genie from Aladdin wearing a wig, and Ken Penders.
    I agree with the second one, purple guy from fnaf NEEDS to be in the game
        For his Neutral Special, he murders children.
            Is that an instant kill on Ness, Lucas, etc?
                Exactly. Specifically on ness, Lucas, Young Link, toon link, technically Dark Pit, and idk if there's others
                    Bowser Jr and olimar.
I know olimar is not a child but I just want him to get brutally murdered
                        You're absolutely right. Also, koopalings
                only if there isn't a rob or megaman nearby. then they start playing as the other fighter until hit with 3 fire attacks. then you become the secret character, Boo
        I was referring to Waluigi but I should’ve put a fnaf rep lol
            Bold of you to assume Waluigi is not the purple guy.
            I- I think I prefer Waluigi
            Fnaf has impacted gaming too much to not be represented
                not really lol, it’s impacted the basic unity indie horror scene but that’s about it
                    Yeah, but it got so popular and i bet a lot of popular horror games wouldn’t have been made without it
    If he’s forklift certified then he can kill Sonic
Waluigi

        Thanks, and yeah...these are by far the best heavy hitters that are realizable, well-known, and each offer something different to the game. 

TBH I was shocked to not see any of them in FP2, I was certain we'd get Crash
            I would like 2 see Shadow instead of Eggman impo, but I like both equally.
                [deleted]
    No Spyro?
        Spyro would probably be fifth choice for me
    I came here to mention Dante, Eggman, Crash and Shantae. We almost have the same top 4.

The knight - Hollow Knight

Or 

Hornet - Hollow Knight, after Silk song comes out (take your time Cherry)
    A hollow knight character would be amazing to be the first indie rep in smash
        All for hollow knight characters but wouldn't Steve count as the first
            Yes and no. Minecraft use to be an indie game but after mojang was bought by Microsoft. It is now considered an triple A game, which is the time Steve got into smash.
    This would be one of my picks. But honestly I think Hornet would be my choice, seems like an even more varied and interesting moveset. I’d love to see for myself when(if) Silksong comes out.
    I’ve been wanting the knight as my main pick for so long now you don’t understand
    Primal Aspid for smash let’s gooooo
Fortunately mine’s already a square. I learned that not making a single Mii from the very beginning was very beneficial for me

That said, I’ll take you up on the offer Sakurai(*and OP*): 

- Monster Hunter rep

- Crash

- Another fighting game rep(*im very happy we got Tekken rep, and I love fighting games, so pretty much any game will do*) — UNREPPED franchise preferred 

- Kirby rep(*Bandana Waddle Dee works*)
    Sol badguy
        How would he look though GG is so visually striking I feel like it would clash the ways it drawn
            They managed with everyone else, I'm sure they'd find a way.
            Considering the games we have in smash currently I don’t think he would stand out that much. I mean the closest example I can give is he doesn’t look that far off from xenoblade characters
                That's a fair point, I'm just curious hour the flair of GG would transfer over
        Sol would be too similar to Terry imo 

Instead give us Faust or May since I think they would translate well and are recognisable
            Dolphin spam would be amazing for the amount of rage it would generate. May's moveset would also fit Smash well I think.
    I would *love* to see a Mortal Kombat rep.
        FATALITY

(+PG censorship)
        Sub Zero with a freeze moveset could be a lot of fun. Bonus points if we get the OG 2D sprite Mortal Kombat versions.
        I’d say Scorpion for sure!
        Sub Zero would work well.  Scorpion might be a bit violent, but freezing can be done in a very PG way
    Thoughts on someone from Guilty Gear maybe?
        I feel like it'd be super cursed but I would love to see Zato in Smash

Faust would also be interesting
            give me May or give me death 🐬
                to 🐬

tsu 🐬

ge 🐬

ki 🐬
            Granted, he's now an echo of Rosalina
                It's not quite negative inputs but I'll take it
    Ragna Carnage Scissors his way into the fray!
    My 2 that i would do anything to get in would be monster hunter and bandana waddle dee, lol
    A Soulcalibur or Killer Instinct rep
    At this point I'm just convinced that everyone says "Crash Bandicoot" just because they know it's objectively the right answer or the community would obliterate them for not choosing him.

It can't be possible that literally everyone would choose him lol.
        I played his games as a kid, loved them. It’s that simple for me
            Oh yeah so did I. I didn't even mean that you specifically aren't being genuine. Your comment was just the one that the thought finally crossed my mind that not everyone who is commenting it here can possibly mean it sincerely. 😂 My bad if it came off like it was directed at you specifically.
    Okay hear me out, Nightmare from Soul Calibur
    mh1 greatsword or mhw handler would be peak gameplay
    Fulgore?
Vergil (Devil May Cry)
Demi-Fiend (Shin Megami Tensei)
Raiden (Metal Gear Solid)
Spy (Team Fortress 2)
    Spy: Light character, jabs from behind instakill at any percent, is instantly killed at any percent by fire
        Oof, the Shoto match up would be rough
            shakunetsu !
    Wow, the edgelord challenger-pack.
        This is outrageous! It's unfair! How can you make an edgy pack without Shadow the Hedgehog!
            Assist trophy hell.
            The lack of a shadow echo is kinda lame tbh. They could change quite a few skills as well to suit him more, and of course;

Gun
        Lmao. Literally all edgelords
    *Raiden (Metal Gear Rising)
        Raiden has been in the series since Metal Gear Solid 2.
            I'M THE BUG INSIDE YOU!!!
            while true people would want him from mgr not from mgs 2
                I'd like the Metal Gear Solid 4 version personally.
                    If he did get added I feel he would have the mgs4 as a palette option like for half of them maybe or if i could have it the best way id like all his putfits from mgr and a few mgs4 based ones aswell.
Demi-Fiend (Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne)

Date & Aiba (AI: The Somnium Files)

Heavy (TF2)

    We need castle crashers in smash
    Thanks for the ‘AI: the somnium files’ shout, was gonna say Date as well but wasn’t sure people would’ve known about the game
Master Chief

Heavy from TF2

Dr. Eggman

Geese (with a counter where he says PREDICTABO! when he lands it)
    Geese is too busy fighting a Final Fantasy Protagonist, two bears, Negan from TWD and an e-girl.

            Don’t forget Poland’s Prime Minister.
            get out lol
    Master chief but from Halo 1 so he can’t sprint
    Thought you meant the Untitled Goose Game goose lol
    >Geese

You misspelled "[Groose](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PPjgA_PyeXw/hqdefault.jpg)"
Crash
Tifa
Hades
Urbosa
    Man Tifa would have Silly moveset
        But she'd have two VERY compelling reasons to put her in the game...
    I love Tifa, but I would be upset if we got a THIRD FF7 rep before getting any other FF representation. Please give me someone else; Tidus, Noctis, Kain, Terra, FF14 player character, anyone.
    Hades the god? Or Hades Zagreus
        Hades the gods from Kid Icarus
            the only wrong answer 😔
                You clearly haven’t played uprising
    Zagreus would have been insane.

Unless you mean Hades from Disney's Hercules 😏
    +1 for Urbosa. Super cool character that could have a super cool moveset. It could coincide with the release of BotW 2, too.
    *edit

Crash Tifa Hades Mommy
    1000% down for Hades, I’d love an Indie pack, with like, Hollow Knight, Hades, Shovel Knight, and Miriam (from Bloodstained)
Doomguy, ryu hayabusa, crono, scorpion
1.Chibi robo

2.Crash Bandicoot 

3.Shy guy

4.Darknut
    Chibi Robo is such an obvious pick IMO, can't believe he hasn't been added yet
        He’s in a fan made game called super smash flash, it’s a computer game tho
        Chibi-Robo had been my most wanted character for years. As for my other three, well, they'd have pretty much no chance of ever getting in, but it's my fantasy list so:

2 - Geno (I've given up hope that it will ever happen at this point)

3 - Hat Kid

4 - Mike Haggar
    Darknut as in the Legend of Zelda semi-common enemy?

I'd rather Vaati or Tetra personally.
1. Geno (Geno gang never gives up)
2. Jill Valentine w/ Chris Redfield, Leon Kennedy, and Claire Redfield skins (ala Dragon Quest Hero)
3. Dante (how TF is DMC not in here)
4. Doomguy (violence would need to be toned down but DOOM is a huge influence on modern gaming, and  Mr. Guy has amazing moveset potential)
    I think the gore would have to go away completely, but the violence could realistically stay in. We already have some impaling moves (byleth & joker up b) and some anatomically challenging (krool and incin up throw) so without gore I think “Mr. Guy” doesn’t need too much adjustment to his existing arsenal.
    I’ve always wanted doom guy but what could possibly make up an entire move set. In the games he does glory kills and uses guns.

Keep in mind he needs 16 unique attacks and not all of them can be ranged and not sure how the bit of up close combat in Doom would translate

Edit: they could pull it off but it would take a good amount of creative liberties
        I've thought about this a lot since Doomguy/Slayer was my most wanted character, I think the best way to go about it would be to translate thing like his chainsaw, Doomblade, and glory kills to standard attacks and grabs, with his specials being more centered on his ranged weapons.
            The super shotgun can also be treated as a short range move instead of a projectile.
                Could work pretty nicely as an F-Smash
    Doom Guy is Just the Echo of Isabelle while Isabelle becomes the echo of sephiroth
    Holy shit, someone else that wants a resident evil rep.
1. Waluigi
2. Bandana Waddle Dee
3. Crash Bandicoot
4. Either Skull Kid or Dr. Eggman, the former because he's just my next most-wanted after the first three, and the latter really only because Sephiroth’s inclusion makes him the only "super-iconic" gaming villain missing
    To the dr eggman point I think dr wily would be up there as a super iconic gaming villain.
        True, he's definitely up there, but he's not on the same level as Bowser, Eggman, Ganon, and Sephiroth. Maybe the one just below that though.
    I love Majora's Mask, it's my second favorite Zelda game, but I would personally be disappointed to get Skull Kid. Majora's Mask already has a stage and Young Link to represent it. I'd like to see a BotW rep.
    Skull kid would be cool
1st: Ouroboros pair of Noah and Mio

2nd: Ouroboros pair of Eunie and Taion

3rd: Ouroboros pair of Lanz and Sena

4th: free space
    4th space goes to Gigachadpon Riku and Manana.
        Riku get job done right
            *This is bad, Noah!*
                *Now we see real Nopon potential!*
                    *This might be too much for one Nopon...*
                        *But not for two!*
    4th place is clearly only for the one and only man of the sea, Triton
1. Kratos
2. Edward Kenway
3. 2B
4. Aloy
    EDWARD KENWAY FUCK YEAH
        He'd be so dope
            Yeah although ezio would prob have a way better change of getting in
                Ezio is more iconic but Ed is a better character
    BRUH I SAID KRATOS AND 2B ALSO
        Great minds think alike
Tails, Conker, Crash and Midna
    Midna would be fuckin dope
        Would be, but they'd probably make her cursed and combine her with Wolf Link to replicate Duck Hunt.
            ☹️
Waluigi, knuckles, heihachi, shy guy
    Shy guy is an interesting choice
        A cool three-in-one character could be Goomba, Koopa Troopa, and Shy Guy as some kind of a Mario Enemy Trio
            pkmn trainer esque or all three at once?
            Ah yes Corporal Paraplonk, Private Goomp & Sergeant Guy.  An odd Rep considering how long ago Mario and Luigi Inside Story came out but I support them.
            That would be so sick
                Id prefer, a Monster Hunter Main character that switches between 3 or 4 weapon types with full armor swaps with the weapons would be the shit. Like pokemon trainer, but instead of swapping between pokemon, your character does a quick "sailor moon-like" transformation into different armor and weapons with different movesets. Each color palette swap is just a different looking character, so you can pick the one you prefer the most.
    As long as black Shy Guy is one of the options
Hat Kid (A Hat in Time), Imposter (Among Us), Kris (Deltarune), the Knight from Hollow Knight
    No instead of the imposter we should get Barry Steakfries
    I hate you but also very good choices
    Wow, 4 indie reps. Huh.
Fromsoftware's sekiro, for soulsbourne rep, and the fact that he's the only named player character. Or, a tarnished from elden ring. Possibly kratos, very cool axe/dual wielder, either arthur morgan or john marston, and master chief or doomguy, but fr this time
    OR THE HUNTER FROM BLOODBORNE!
        I dont need britain colonizing smash
        THIS GAME'S WINNER IS *hoonter*
    Solaire of Astora?
        I definitely agree Solaire would be the best Fromsoftware rep
            They could do like Hero and Bowser Jr, have the player character and each alt be DeS, DS1,2,3, Elden Ring armour
    Sekiro would work sooo freaking good with smash. There's so much variety in his moves in the og game. Grapple up b, shuriken neutral b, axe side b, umbrella down b.  Spear f smash, firecrackers down smash, flame up smash. 
But what would be his FS tho?
        Immortal severance, he just fucking chops your head off.
        I'm not entirely sure. Maybe his final smash will call the demon of hatred. Just call it down and it's pretty much like a glorified assist trophy. 

Or Genichiro or Isshin could do their lighting attack and sekiro could catch it and and redirect it at whoever is caught in the smash. Maybe if it's not a cut scene smash, it could be like Bowser's where you could aim it. So you use the final smash and Sekiro grapples to a platform (like Pokemon trainer on FD or Battlefield). And then you aim it. When you press it it does a little cutscene where he jumps, catches the lighting and boom.

But overall I love your moveset idea, I am kind of bummed he isn't in the game now lol
        His jab or ftilt could be his regular combo, he'd have a crawl, which could make him go invisible which would pay homage to the fact that hes a shinobi

Rayman (valid because he’s cool)
    Hornet when silksong releases for marketing
    Behead would be insane to see!

Neutral b: Multiple-Nocks Bow

Down B: Cudgel (parry/timed reflector)

Jabs: Balanced Blade

Ftilt: Spartan Sandals

Dtilt: Hayabusa Boots (different animation)

Up B: Infantry Grenade (makes up for poor recovery with 2 midair jumps for 3 jumps in total)

Dair: Slam attack (nearly suicide off stage)

Nair: Panchaku

Fsmash: Nutcracker

Dsmash: Telluric Shock (slightly modified) 

Usmash: Broadsword (different animation)

Final Smash: Cursed Sword (deals insane damage and msu even kill at 0% but if he whiffs it there’s some recovery and if he gets hit at all during the the animation he immediately dies. 

You already know what his intro animation and logo would be. 


Or throw everything I said out the window and make him weird like Hero and Steve and give him access to nearly every weapon
    Beheaded has opportunity for the most interesting move set ever
1. Amaterasu from okami cause I can

2. Chun-li cause it's alittle suprising she's not in already 

3. Monster Hunter featuring various armors 4 boy and 4 girl being ratholos, zinogre, deviljho and anjanath since they're all big monsters in the series

4. Bandanna Waddle Dee cause it's suprising that this character hasn't been added since he's kinda one of the big four along with kirby, dedede, and metaknight
    This is a good one, I agree
    Someone’s a capcom fan
    I feel it would be more likely for akuma to get in as he could be a echo/semi-clone of ryu or be like alph
-Reimu

-Dante

-Midna

-Eggman
Marisa Kirisame (Touhou Project). Touhou is one of the oldest indie IP still running to this day, and it's fanbase is still massive despite relatively little hype. And not Reimu, because her invitation is stolen in the trailer. 

Bandana Dee (Kirbo). No explanation needed

Doom Guy. Because I challenge you to find an FPS more influenticial than the OG Doom, and he's an Icon since DOOM(2016) and Doom Eternal

And the ultimate shitpost : Sandbag. Yes like in Smash Flash 2.
    Sandbag let's gooo
    Here’s a rebuttal to your DOOM comment: Master Chief. Not more but almost there
Crash bandicoot, skull kid, shantae and terra branford.
Love final fantasy 6.
    Terra rocks, but I don't think we'd need any more ff reps.
The Ninja turtles
    OH, I like this idea!
Isaac (Golden Sun), 
Geno, 
Lyn/Hector (FE7),
Knuckles
    I've wanted isaac or felix since brawl. Too bad golden sun is so niche now
    Knunckles yeaaah
    I like your style
eirika, eliwood, lyn, and seliph
    *Everyone liked that
    I’d swap Eirika out for Ephraim and Eliwood out for Hector. Would be cool to get FE reps who wielded something other than swords. Obviously I don’t feel that way about Lyn because she is my queen.
        the joke was that i picked exclusively sword lords
Phoenix Wright

Zero (Megaman X)

Shadow the Hedgehog

Skull Kid
Morbius
    It's smashin' time.
Travis Touchdown

Demi-Fiend

Pyramid Head or Nemesis

Scorpion
    What are your thoughts about getting Albert Wesker instead of Nemesis
[edited to screw with Reddit banning 3rd-party apps and its users - bye]
    I hate camilla with a burning passion but i am so starved for FE characters that does not use a sword that i will take it lmao.
Mii mage, mii thief, mii axebattler, mii thicc
    Or just 4mii thicc echos
        No just one but he’s super wide
DJ Octavio, The Knight from Hollow Knight, Monokuma, and maybe some kind of roguelike/roguelite rep (Zagreus would be cool!)
    I like your picks.
    I also like your picks.
Shadow, Waluigi, a new Mii (Wizard or something), and another FE rep to annoy the “eWw mOrE fIrE eMbLeM” people.
    Make the FE rep a swordie too, for extra salt.

Maybe even make sure they have blue hair and would have a similar moveset to Marth.
        Give him tippers, too
Dave Miller from Dayshift at Freddy’s

That’s it

Just put him in 4 times
Waluigi

Impa

Crash

Kratos
Crash bandicoot 
Rayman 
Gex(funny)
Me
Chell 
Marx
Heavy Scout and Spy
Terraria Guy
Dark matter because we need at least 1 Kirby villain, so might as well pick the most important

Jack Frost because Joker isn't an smt rep, he's a p5 rep

Eggman for the same reason as Dark Matter

Zero because mah man deserve better than an assist trophy.
    This guy’s good
    As long as he has his appearance from megaman zero series as an option I'd pick zero as my number 1.
        His mmz moveset would be nice too
1. Bandana Waddle Dee
2. Isaac Moriah
3. Paper Mario
4. literally any mittopia representation
    Just give the Miis the ability to use Miitopia wigs, makeup, and some new classes.
Everyone from persona 5
monke
Fulgore: My most wanted smash rep, so this is a no Brainer for me. I feel like you could do some really Interesting things with his reactor. Devastation beam would be final smash

Demoman: In game in tf2 demoman has the largest variety of playstyles, so I feel like he'd be the most Interesting to bring into smash. Final smash would probably give kritskrieg übercharge

Zagreus: there is so much you could do with zagreus, I don't even know where to begin. There's many ways you could the Titan slayers with their many aspects. Stygius would be a unique sword to use, varatha would finally give us a pole arm in smash, Aegis bull rush could be used Interestingly, coronacht would be a strong ranged attack, malphon would be a strong close quarters attacking weapon, and Exagryph would be a neat mid range weapon. Maybe before battle you can cycle through a menu of different gods/goddesses you can select as boons to get effects on your inputs. Final smash could be a max level call from you current boon. Might even be able to use daedalus's buffs. So many interesting ways you can bring him into smash

Waluigi: I don't think I need to explain this one
    While demoman might work technically best, I feel like heavy deserves the spot the most.
-A Shin Megami Tensei representative (other than Joker). The best bets are Nahobino (SMTV), Flynn (SMTIV), Demi-Fiend (SMT Nocturne) and Jack Frost (Mascot).
-Grovyle, so Pokemon Gen3 and Pokemon Mystery Dungeon have representation.
-Waluigi, not only for the joke but to represent the Mario sport spin offs (Since he was born from Mario Tennis).
-Some Zelda villain that is not Ganondorf (Vaati for example), or Impa.
    I’d say Jack Frost is who I would pick for shin megami tensei
Custom Robo Rep (maybe Ray 01)

Golden Sun Rep (Isaac or Felix)

Monster Hunter Rep

Mio or Noah from Xenoblade Chronicles 3
Monster hunter

Undertale rep

Noah&Mio

Crash Bandicoot
    The Undertale rep will be Papyrus’s Bed
    Love the Noah and Mio pick. Hypothetically, if they were a fighter, I wonder how Interlinking would be implemented. What I mean is, would it be tied to a move like their down b, or would it be a meter in a similar fashion to something like Arsene?
Aran Ryan from Punch Out!! cuz it 'll be funny as hell.

Waluigi cuz he's my second favorite Mario character.

Geno cuz then Geno fans will shut up.

And Heavy from tf2 cuz it 'll be funny as hell.
    OMG I wasn't expecting to see Aran here! Now I'm imaging a hilarious moveset
        It would be funny as hell!

Though I wont accept any inclusion of him without a secret taunt where he goes: "Ye probably got cheesburgers in your gloves have ya Mac!?" When he's in a match with Little Mac


In Punch Out, he's got lots of numbers 7 in his match

*You get 7 stamina points.*

*When you intercept his punch, you can hit him 7 times.*

*If he goes down, he always gets back up at 7 seconds during the countdown.*

*There's a challenge in exhibition mode where you have to hit Aran with 7 Star Punches*


He's also a dirty boxer (nr.1 in total rulebreaks)

*Headbutts*

*Elbows*

*Asking Mac to hit him*

*Horseshoes in his boxing gloves*

*Boxing glove on a rope*


So let's implement that by doing some things like

*When Aran got the number 7 in his percentage, he deals more damage. (Maybe a horseshoe that appears in his gloves at that percentage?)*

*If there are 7 people in a match, he 'll have some nice easter egg maybe.*

*Attacks that implement his headbutts, elbows,...*

*Make the "Asking to get hit" into a counter maybe?*

*Boxing glove on a rope can be used as a ranged weapon or like a teather up-b like Min-Min. (Or both?)*


Just a few ideas, hope you like 'em.
            Yea, punch out is loaded with little secrets like the lucky 7s. I'd love those things as a moveset for him, especially the tether glove. Personally, I'd think it would be funny if in stamina mode, Aran threw an attack with the glove on a string as he went down, and if the opponent went down to it,  Aran would take priority.
                Omg that would be so funny!

    Not enough Waluigi
        I would also like to replace every character with waluigi
            Now I start to understand you
        All of the Waluigi's Echo fighters are also Waluigi.
            I think all items in game should be replaced with waluigi assist trophy
                All fighters are replaced with Waluigi as well and the game's title is changed to "Super Waluigi Bros."
                    Super Smash Waluigi

-	Carlos Santana
-	Sarah Huckabee Sanders
    I would actually cry if Kevin from Home Alone 2: Lost in New York got added
Easy,
The Knight, Cuphead, Waluigi and Chell
4 echoes would be
Paper Mario (Mario), Shadow The Hedgehog (Sonic), Ms Pac-Man (Pac Man) and Yamamura + undodog (Duck Hunt)
1: Raiden from MGR
2: Bandana Waddle Dee
3: Either a reworked YLink or Impa 
4: Shez or Lysethia from FE3Hopes

Controversial, I know
Skull kid, majora itself, zant, girahim, or impa (only one from Zelda)

The tarnished/undead/hollow/kindled (basically a dark souls rep that could work in a Similar way to byleth but using souls weapons and souls attack patterns as combos)

A corvo attono (dishonoured) or his daughter Emily Caldwin (dishonoured 2) 

A borderlands rep (probably cl4ptr4p)

Edited for grammar
Ragna the Bloodedge

Sol Badguy

Heavy
Rillaboom: Final form of the Grass Starter from Pokemon Sword/Shield. Rounds out the set considering that the game already has Greninja (water) and Incineroar (Fire). Making a set for a Grass Gorrila shouldn't be that hard. If they wanted to be REAL lazy they just make it a shadow of DK.

Impa: There are not many recurring characters in the Zelda series, but Impa is one of them. Lots of options here but when she isn't presented as a little old lady she is presented as a Ninja. In the Warrior games though she is shown to use a Naginata, a Giant sword, or a short sword.

Zero: the OTHER main playable character from the Megaman Franchise. So yes, another SWORD user character. But the set should be simple enough to make.

Tifa(7)/Sabin(6)/Zell(8): another Final Fantasy Character but instead of using a sword they use their FISTS. Call the Character MONK and do a HERO situation where you have the same Character but different Skins.
Waluigi

Alucard

Master Chief

Doomguy

>!At this point I'll just take Alucard, why did Nintendo even stop adding characters!<
    They stopped cause sakurai has a unhealthy obsession with working on smash
        Well, couldn't the rest of the devs take a temporary creative director to make the characters and just touch bases every so often to make sure they're doing it right? That's what the creators of the Clone Wars did with George Lucas, they just made sure what they were planning was okay and kept rolling with it, and that show came out amazing
            Sakurai is a very I-need-to-be-there-and-do-it-myself kind of guy. While they could do that, I doubt sakurai would agree to it
Hornet, Waluigi (yes i Saïd it), Master Chief, and the Dragonborn.
DISCLAIMER: There's no way this would ever happen lmao

1. Ninten (Earthbound Zero)
2. Gordon Freeman (Half-Life)

4. Tifa (Italian Senate)
Viewtiful Joe, Raz, Crash, Rayman
1. Waluigi
2. Crash Bandicoot
3. Spyro
4. Dante
Eggman - A mix of rush down and zoning

Dante - plays like Sephiroth and Bayonetta combined 

 Doomslayer - Grappler, with rush down potential and ladder combos

And as a joke we can have Pyramid Head who is the slowest character in the game but his power moves kill at 0%
Chrono from Chrono Trigger

Demi Fiend from Shin Megami Tensei

Geno from Super Mario RPG

Ninten from Mother 1/EarthBound Beginnings.
- Kratos (GoW)
- Phoenix Wright (Ace Attorney)
- Archer (Fate Stay Night VN)
- Bomberman (Bomberman), would also be funny in combo with the Mii outfit and assist trophy
    Man getting more VN characters in Smash would be really nice
    Archer would be sick af

Tho ngl I'm pretty sure if they would take someone from fate they would take saber

    I’d honestly think Rillaboom would be a better fit. We have gotten the gen 6 water starter and the Gen 7 Fire starter
rayman.
I’d say bandana waddle Dee, sceptile, tails, and rayman
Crash Bandicoot, Doom Slayer, Bandanna Dee, and tails.

This isn’t who I any the most as much as who I think deserves it. To me Crash and Doom guy are the two 3rd party characters who felt missing from the fighter’s pass, with Crash representing the PlayStation and Doom Slayer representing shooters. Bandanna Dee to me is all we need to complete the Kirby roster, as in most games he now gets just as much focus as Dedede and Meta Knight. And it feels weird for Sonic to only have 1 character, we need another. I would personally prefer Knuckles, but objectively I think Tails is more deserving.

Reimu Hakurei (Any Touhou rep would work, Reimu is just most recognizable. Stage would probably have other characters in the back, hopefully with more than seven polygons, looking at you, Garreg Mach.)
Any roguelike character. Preferably Isaac, Bullet Kin, or The Beheaded, but any roguelike character will do.
Nintendo would probably add four more Fire Emblem or Xenoblade characters…

I would add Waluigi, Crono (From Chrono Trigger), Phoenix wright, and probably a Pokémon of some kind
1. Hollow Knight

Vivi (FFIX) or Terra (FFVI)

Crash Bandicoot

Mace/Alana (Fighting Force)

Hunter (Monster Hunter)
* Felix from Golden Sun (because Isaac is an assist trophy already)
* Octoling from Splatoon 2 or 3 (uses different weapons than Inkling, so not a echo, though an echo is fine too in the vein as Villager/Isabelle)
* Rillaboom, the grass starter pokemon from Sword and Shield (so we have Pokemon trainer with 3 starters, and 3 additional starters from different generations on their own).
* Chibi Robo (give this boy a worthy exit at the very least!)
* Bonus impossible fifth, Warrior of Light from Final Fantasy (Dissidia version as base with costumes/colors based on other appearances, like the Amano art version and one based on the OG red sprite)

* Heavy from TF2
* Chell from Portal
* Madeline from Celeste (keeping her 2D, like Mr G&W, and pixelart)

Heavy and Chell would share the same "Valve" tab on the music section, with soundtracks from other Valve games as well (Half-Life, Dota 2, etc).
Crash, ratchet and clank, dr eggman, and waluigi of course
3 character indie pack

Shovel Night (would dad black knight as an echo but we’re trying to make a rectangle)

Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, Foxy. Easy
- Madeline from Celeste

- Demoman TF2

- A Monster Hunter rep, probably a palico tbh

- The baby Mario Bros
Master Chief, Walugi, Mickey Mouse, Dragonborn,
*Phoenix Wright* - Ace Attorney is a really important series to me, and of all the characters from all the games I've played, Phoenix Wright is always the one character I truly want to see in an official smash game. He's got lots of content to pull from for alts, the moveset, and even an echo in the form of Apollo or Edgeworth. Phoenix Wright will always be my number 1 choice.

*Crono* - Similar to Ace Attorney, Chronotrigger is an extremely important game to me, and it's honestly  surprising that Crono isn't in smash already. He has a ton of options for a possible moveset, alt costumes, the stage, and the music. Chronotrigger is iconic and well loved by a lot of people, me included, and I'd love to see Chronotrigger get more of the attention it deserves.

*Heavy* - A shooter rep would be interesting, but if I had to choose one, it'd be Heavy from TF2. I'd also be fine with Doomguy or Jack Cooper/A Pilot, though I feel Heavy would just be more interesting and fun to play as.

*Waluigi* - Really, any highly requested character would be fine with me. Geno, Bandana Dee, Crash, whoever. I just chose Waluigi because he's the one I'd like to see most. His potential moveset, alt costumes, and stage are all easy to imagine, and I think out of all the characters I've mentioned, Waluigi is the one I've wanted in the longest. But, fittingly, Waluigi isn't my top pick, rather he'll always be my number 2 most wanted character.


Truthfully, I just want good smash games. I don't mind the roseter being smaller if the game is enjoyable and well made, even if that means not getting some of my most wanted characters. Smash is fun to me because of the gameplay, not the roster or it's size.
Master Chief, Goku, Chun-li, Tails
Bandanna waddle Dee, Dante, Little ghost and Raven beak.
Shovel Knight

My number one wish character that I was hoping for until he was shown off as an assist trophy.

Raiden

Recently played through MGR and holy shit it was awesome. Raiden absolutely is the best rep for metal gear besides snake himself. Also MGR music in smash would be awesome.

Doom Slayer

The character that pioneered the fps genre should absolutely get a spot in a video game hall of fame, it would be interesting to see how an fps character gets adapted to a fighting game.

Raven Beak

I just like Metroid and he’s the perfect new rep. That’s all.

Fire emblem character number 1 + Fire emblem character number 2 + Fire emblem character number 3 + Fire emblem character number 4

I think

Jonesy or the rb noob

Senator Armstrong 

Aran Ryan 

Waluigi or malice Gannon 

First off, about Jonesy/loopers… he reps an era no other fighter (mabye Kirby does because kbr) represents: the 2019 br-boom also I’ve repeatedly stated he has a lot of potential for movesets

The noob is not only a “villain” (rb’s horrible reputation) but also represents the mobile market, keyword: market [p.s I hate roblox to my very core but admit they kinda deserve the spot

Senator Armstrong is a Metal gear rep, a villain and “common worker” (to replace dr Mario in spirit battles as that stereotype)

Aran Ryan is a not so gimmicky punch out character that reps the super punch out era even if his moveset will be pulled from Wii, spo never gets a bone… ever, but it’s the easiest to access on the switch

Aran represents a type of fighter under-represented in smash, the cheater… hero plays LIKE one and wario ACTS like one but neither are that arcetype

3. Crash Bandicoot
4. Sol Badguy
To make development easier, Akuma, Shadow, Twilight Link, and Raichu. Sakurai does deserve a break, and those characters would probably be the easiest to add. 

Although I wouldn’t complain if any one of those characters was replaced with Waluigi or Lightning McQueen (he is *technically* a video game character).

• Garchomp

• Hollow Knight

• Kris from Deltarune

• Susie from Deltarune



Special Character mechanics:

Garchomp: he has a meter thar fills up over time like joker, but it's not a total copy. He can't use a counter like joker to charge it by getting hit but it charges when he gets hit normally or it can charge passively over time. Once the meter is full he mega evolves which basically makes all of his moves more powerful versions of his normal moves.

Hollow Knight: by hitting opponents he gains soul. he can fire his soul blast by tapping neutral B and it consumes 1/3 of the soul meter. he can also hold down neutral B to regain health. It regains more health if you keep holding down neutral B and also uses 1/3 soul (assuming you have the soul to do so). Ex: if you hold neutral B with full soul meter it'll heal for 10% but if you use 2/3 while keeping the button held it'll heal 15% and full soul usage would regain 20% (this would obviously be very slow and punishable to not make it op)

Kris: (I couldn't come up with something very original for them so just deal with it.) by attacking opponents kris gains TP. Kris is then able to use ralsei's heal prayer with down B and heal 10% from kris after they have gained 32 tp. the move would be decently fast because it doesn't heal very much.

Susie: she also gains TP by attacking opponents (her tp bar will be purple while kris's is blue to distinguish them in game) after she has gained 50% tp she can use rude buster, a ranged attack with high damage and knock back. The move would take a bit to start up but once the projectile is launched it moves pretty fast. 


(Thanks for listening to my [hopefully] good rant about why these chars should be in smash! comment what I could make better about these concepts!)
Shantae, Bomber Man, Tails, Chrono
Nightmare from Soul Calibur would be amazing
\-Lara Croft  
\-Master Chief  
\-Sub-Zero  
\-Spyro
1. Lara Croft
2. Vector Man
3. Yoshimitsu
4. Earth Worm Jim
I will die on the hill that weather she was a highly requested character or not, Lara Croft deserved a spot in the roster 
If Smash is a celebration of gaming, Lara was a pioneer in 3d adventure titles, while remaining influential to this day. It genuinely blows my mind that so few people ever bring her up during conversations of who "deserved" to be in smash.
Angry Birds

Bandana Dee

Octoling

Rayman
Team rocket/  wadeldee /rep monster hunter or a monster from story /gumba

Orisa not anyone else at all really?
Sceptile

\-Alucard from Castlevania, because it was already a fifty-fifty between him and the Belmonts  
\-Pheonix Wright, because how the hell do we not have ANYTHING from Ace Attorney? The games have been Nintendo exclusive since forever and we already have so much else from Capcom. This is a must.  
\-A guardian from Zelda BotW. I will not elaborate.  
\-Neco-Arc from Tsukihime because buru-nyah.
Frederica (Triangle Strategy), Mii Sorcerer (Mii), Paper Mario (Paper Mario), Omori (OMORI)

In that order.
Astro Boy (how this doesn’t come up in new character conversations is criminal). He could play like mega man, but with more brawling and aerial focused moves. New IP in smash. One of my fave GBA games is Astro Boy: Omega Factor

Waluigi (obvious)

Dr. Eggman (or other sonic rep, but I think he would be the most unique. Something like bowser jr.)

Deoxys the Pokémon!!!! This would be so good, and have so many options!!

Backup is Sly Cooper
    Deoxys would be FIRE
        Exactly! Idk why people don’t suggest it. He could have a variety mixup move set as well which fits with all of his forms.
    Astro boy is from an anime, you know
        It was actually a manga series in the 1950s-60s. But it was one of the first televised anime shows in Japan
Dante, Doomguy, Sol Badguy, and Waluigi. Make everyone happy.
Tf2 rep (I’m thinking scout or heavy), waluigi, Jeff(earthbound), and chell (portal). I know some of these are already assist trophies / spirits, but just replace those idk
I made a list of my top 100 characters before the game came out so I’d have a better chance of getting at least one I wanted. Still didn’t happen, granted, my picks can be pretty esoteric/unpopular. 

1. Vessel/Knight (Hollow Knight) 

2. Raichu (make him/her heavy, and new move set besides like thunder) 

3. Wes/Michael (from Pokémon Colosseum/GoD, make it a switching character of umbreon/Espeon or the og 3 eeveelutions) 

4. Dovahkiin/Dragonborn (Skyrim)
Hmm… do they have to exclusively be video game characters?

If not:
- Gangnam Style Beerus
- Michael Horny-sus (*Morbius*)
- Harry Potter’s Patronus (not Harry himself, he isn’t even gonna be present)
- Bird from Egypt (Oats Jenkins)

A second set if not videogame-exclusive
- 🗿
- r/redditmoment
- Obi-Wan Kenobi
- Kid Named Finger
Four alterations of goku
Reimu, Geno, Waluigi, and Sol Badguy. Cause why not.
1. Waluigi

He Deserves it

2. Skull Kid

Fire Emblem shouldn’t have more fighters than Zelda, plus Skull kid is cool

3. Sceptile/ Roblox Noob

I love Pokémon and even though I’m team Mudkip, We need a final evo grass type and sceptile is the coolest. But we already have plenty of Pokémon so if not, Roblox Noob because it would be funny.

4. Bandana Dee/ Freddy Fazbear

We need more Kirby but I also wanted to fit FNAF in here
morgana

goku

Lego stormtrooper

Waluigi, Rayman, Crash, Earthworm Jim or Tails
Gruntilda, Crash, Paper Mario, and Papyrus
Waluigi 4 times, then remove all the copy/pasted anime swordsmen and replace them withan equal number of waluigi
Bandana Waddle Dee (wholesome Boi deserves to be in)

Edelgard (should’ve been chosen over Byleth imo. Gives FE an antihero / morally grey character instead of the usual. Could use 3 Hopes design)

Spyro (would be really cool as a new game representative and they could try and pay homage to Skylanders through him too)

Zagreus (Have him use the different weapons, not just sword, like they did with Byleth I suppose)
Y’all sleeping on eggman
Can I instead just remove Yoshi, Falco, Zelda and Mega Man?
Waluigi (obviously), Toad, Bandana Waddle Dee, and Raven Beak.

(I'd like another Zelda rep but I can't think of anyone for it)
Revan, Lord Shaxx, Freddy Fazbear, & GONK

More times implies that he is already in the game. Sakurai would never put Mario in.
    Who the fuck is Mario
        i think he's luigi's brother, from the first super luigi game on the nes. he's kind of obscure so i dont think he could get in
            AKA red Luigi
                there's a reason I hold a love/hate relationship with this meme
        Chris Pratt.
            You mean Bob Hoskins?
        Wahoo
        You know how sometimes people are referred to by their last name? well luigis last name is Mario, so they're referring to luigi
        Everyone knows that Mario is cool as fuck.
    I know. Dr. Mario was easily the most-deserving inclusion in the entire game, but Regular Mario? GTFO, he's super-unimportant.
        I hate this meme
            I hate this world
                I hate you
                    I hate your pet goldfish
                I hate this universe
                I hate
                    I
                        #
        Regular Mario is such a niche character like who honestly cares
Look, we need more Mario alts.
    A propeller suit alt would be awesome.
We totally need silver Mario! /s
    Pink gold peach for smash!
    Nah we need Gold Mario smh
        Oh, we can't go getting too greedy now
So then you can add 4 more echoes, so it's a rectangle both ways!
    Let's see:

* Alph as an Olimar Echo (no longer just an alt.)
* Impa as a Sheik Echo
* Octoling as an Inkling Echo
* Black Shadow as Captain Falcon/Ganondorf Echo?
        The lack of octolings as an alt for inkling is probably my biggest disappointment with the character
            It's easy to understand why there weren't any Octoling alts. for Inkling, because Inkling already has male and female alts. Adding Octoling on top of that would mean there'd only be 4 Inklings, and given how colorful and diverse Inklings can be in Splatoon, I think that was the smart choice.

Additionally, Octolings were really only basic enemies until Octo Expansion, where one of them (Agent 8) became playable in that story, before becoming playable in regular matches upon beating it. And Octo Expansion was most-likely released too late for Sakurai to even consider them as playable fighters.
                I mean there’s 4 alts for Steve….
                    That’s different tho, the legacy edition Steve skins aren’t as sought after and they already got the best alts for Steve and Alex
                        Tuxedo was and still is my favorite Steve Alex skins
                Just make one alt the male and one the female octoling and give them colors we don’t use yet.
                Doesn’t little Mac have 16 alts
        black shadow with ganon moveset and then make ganon a real character
            That's what I was gonna say! Like honestly, remove Black Shadow swords and give them something more like what they'd have in F0 (I've never played or watched any of this game so idk). Give Ganon something that's far more Zelda inspired
                The current moveset is ok. Falcon is also fully smash based. But change side special, flame choke is literally the only thing that's actually based out of something.
                    Doesn't he falcon punch in the anime?
                        The anime came after smash.
                    Yah, and I love the fact that the ganon we have is a heavy hitter that just feeeels like a villain, but it would be nice to have some Zelda inspired move sets. Maybe a magic ganon moveset and then a power based one?
            YES!!!!!
        I was thinking, Dry Bowser as a less heavy and “sharper” version of bowser would be cool, and iill tell you what I mean by “sharper”. So, he doesn’t deal more knockback on moves, maybe he even deals less, but he deals more damage nonetheless (the knockback is reduced so that it comes out even on average when damage is considered). If this didn’t work, I guess they could just make him lighter and more combo-reliant. I just like the idea of a lighter bowser as an echo
        We need Zack as a Cloud echo too
        ganondorf is already half a falcon echo so I don’t get that
            The common opinion is that it would be cool to have him as an echo that has basically ganondorf's moveset, and make ganon a new and more faithful moveset
                Yep.

Ganon in the games isn't some lumbering oaf, he's deceptively quick and has sword play equal or superior to the Hero.
        Demise as ganon echo.

Sure he might only be the villain in one single zelda game but he’s also the start of the timeline and his evil spirit is what reincarnates into Ganondorf throughout the rest of the games so adding him as an echo to ganon would be perfect.

Tbh I’d want him to be a new character all together, but even if he was an echo I’d take it
    More than 4, but here's some ideas.

And I don't think Echoes should be between 2 unrelated series.

Shadow as a Sonic Echo.

Ms. Pac-Man as a Pac-Man Echo.

Jeanne as a Bayonetta Echo.

Ninten as a Ness Echo.

Impa as a Sheik Echo.

Funky Kong as a Donkey Kong Echo.

Proto Man as a Mega Man Echo.

Octoling as an Inkling Echo.

Raichu as Pikachu Echo (Same skeleton, but scaled up.)
        Honestly I'm still surprised some of these didn't get in. Many of them are really obvious, and would've required very little work.
    -Funky Kong as a DK Echo

-Ms PAC Man as a PAC Man Echo

-Birdo as a Yoshi Echo

-Big Boss as a Snake Echo
        I don't see how Birdo would work as a Yoshi echo. I'd replace them with Shadow as a Sonic Echo.
    Shadow as Sonics and his Homing Spin Attack can be Chaos Control and Shadow just dive kicks an enemy.

Proto man as Mega Man with different robot abilities. And a taunt to play his tune.

Zero as Cloud's echo cause he deserves it.

And I would like to see Tetra as Toon Links echo cause I think that would be fun.
    Or give every single character an Echo and force them to stack.
    And again I say, Ghost Dad King Rhoam as an echo on Pyra/Mythra
    Going with

- Funky Kong (Donkey Kong)
- Octoling (Inkling)
- Roxas (Sora)
- Knuckles as an echo of Little Mac don’t ask me to elaborate
    Let's see: 

Blaziken as a Capt Falcon Echo

Waluigi as a Wii Fit Echo 

Octoling as an Inkling Echo

Baby Mario & Baby Luigi as Ice Climber Echos
        > Waluigi as a Wii Fit Echo

So brave.

> Baby Mario & Baby Luigi as Ice Climber Echos

Put this man in charge of everything.
Give him his dragon for his ultimate

fine dear, I'll listen to weekend whip _again_
4 characters we desperately need
    What about Hank Hill
Who's the purple haired genie?
    Shantae, haven’t personally played the games but I know a lot of people want her in, and it seems like there’s a decent moveset opportunity
        I want her sooooo bad
    The genie from Aladin, but with purple hair. Specifically Will Smiths rendition. Hope this helps.
    Gotcha, you want Coco Bandicoot, Purple Guy from FNAF, Genie from Aladdin wearing a wig, and Ken Penders.
I agree with the second one, purple guy from fnaf NEEDS to be in the game
    For his Neutral Special, he murders children.
        Is that an instant kill on Ness, Lucas, etc?
            Exactly. Specifically on ness, Lucas, Young Link, toon link, technically Dark Pit, and idk if there's others
                Bowser Jr and olimar.
I know olimar is not a child but I just want him to get brutally murdered
                    You're absolutely right. Also, koopalings
            only if there isn't a rob or megaman nearby. then they start playing as the other fighter until hit with 3 fire attacks. then you become the secret character, Boo
    I was referring to Waluigi but I should’ve put a fnaf rep lol
        Bold of you to assume Waluigi is not the purple guy.
        I- I think I prefer Waluigi
        Fnaf has impacted gaming too much to not be represented
            not really lol, it’s impacted the basic unity indie horror scene but that’s about it
                Yeah, but it got so popular and i bet a lot of popular horror games wouldn’t have been made without it
If he’s forklift certified then he can kill Sonic

    biNtY pLS PlAe DMC2 iS BeST gAMe bInYOt daNTe iS GUd hE ScHut dA gUn
This is it folks
    Thanks, and yeah...these are by far the best heavy hitters that are realizable, well-known, and each offer something different to the game. 

TBH I was shocked to not see any of them in FP2, I was certain we'd get Crash
        I would like 2 see Shadow instead of Eggman impo, but I like both equally.
            [deleted]
No Spyro?
    Spyro would probably be fifth choice for me
I came here to mention Dante, Eggman, Crash and Shantae. We almost have the same top 4.
Imagine Chell teleporting between both sides of the stage, almost like Bugs Bunny’s rabbit holes in Multiversus
A hollow knight character would be amazing to be the first indie rep in smash
    All for hollow knight characters but wouldn't Steve count as the first
        Yes and no. Minecraft use to be an indie game but after mojang was bought by Microsoft. It is now considered an triple A game, which is the time Steve got into smash.
This would be one of my picks. But honestly I think Hornet would be my choice, seems like an even more varied and interesting moveset. I’d love to see for myself when(if) Silksong comes out.
I’ve been wanting the knight as my main pick for so long now you don’t understand
Primal Aspid for smash let’s gooooo
Sol badguy
    How would he look though GG is so visually striking I feel like it would clash the ways it drawn
        They managed with everyone else, I'm sure they'd find a way.
        Considering the games we have in smash currently I don’t think he would stand out that much. I mean the closest example I can give is he doesn’t look that far off from xenoblade characters
            That's a fair point, I'm just curious hour the flair of GG would transfer over
    Sol would be too similar to Terry imo 

Instead give us Faust or May since I think they would translate well and are recognisable
        Dolphin spam would be amazing for the amount of rage it would generate. May's moveset would also fit Smash well I think.
I would *love* to see a Mortal Kombat rep.
    FATALITY

(+PG censorship)
    Sub Zero with a freeze moveset could be a lot of fun. Bonus points if we get the OG 2D sprite Mortal Kombat versions.
    I’d say Scorpion for sure!
    Sub Zero would work well.  Scorpion might be a bit violent, but freezing can be done in a very PG way
Thoughts on someone from Guilty Gear maybe?
    I feel like it'd be super cursed but I would love to see Zato in Smash

Faust would also be interesting
        give me May or give me death 🐬
            to 🐬

tsu 🐬

ge 🐬

ki 🐬
        Granted, he's now an echo of Rosalina
            It's not quite negative inputs but I'll take it
Ragna Carnage Scissors his way into the fray!
My 2 that i would do anything to get in would be monster hunter and bandana waddle dee, lol
A Soulcalibur or Killer Instinct rep
At this point I'm just convinced that everyone says "Crash Bandicoot" just because they know it's objectively the right answer or the community would obliterate them for not choosing him.

It can't be possible that literally everyone would choose him lol.
    I played his games as a kid, loved them. It’s that simple for me
        Oh yeah so did I. I didn't even mean that you specifically aren't being genuine. Your comment was just the one that the thought finally crossed my mind that not everyone who is commenting it here can possibly mean it sincerely. 😂 My bad if it came off like it was directed at you specifically.
Okay hear me out, Nightmare from Soul Calibur
mh1 greatsword or mhw handler would be peak gameplay
Fulgore?
Spy: Light character, jabs from behind instakill at any percent, is instantly killed at any percent by fire
    Oof, the Shoto match up would be rough
        shakunetsu !
Wow, the edgelord challenger-pack.
    This is outrageous! It's unfair! How can you make an edgy pack without Shadow the Hedgehog!
        Assist trophy hell.
        The lack of a shadow echo is kinda lame tbh. They could change quite a few skills as well to suit him more, and of course;

Gun
    Lmao. Literally all edgelords
*Raiden (Metal Gear Rising)
    Raiden has been in the series since Metal Gear Solid 2.
        I'M THE BUG INSIDE YOU!!!
        while true people would want him from mgr not from mgs 2
            I'd like the Metal Gear Solid 4 version personally.
                If he did get added I feel he would have the mgs4 as a palette option like for half of them maybe or if i could have it the best way id like all his putfits from mgr and a few mgs4 based ones aswell.
We need castle crashers in smash
Thanks for the ‘AI: the somnium files’ shout, was gonna say Date as well but wasn’t sure people would’ve known about the game
Geese is too busy fighting a Final Fantasy Protagonist, two bears, Negan from TWD and an e-girl.
    And is also a falling father figure 🤭
        Don’t forget Poland’s Prime Minister.
        get out lol
Master chief but from Halo 1 so he can’t sprint
Thought you meant the Untitled Goose Game goose lol
>Geese

You misspelled "[Groose](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PPjgA_PyeXw/hqdefault.jpg)"
Man Tifa would have Silly moveset
    But she'd have two VERY compelling reasons to put her in the game...
I love Tifa, but I would be upset if we got a THIRD FF7 rep before getting any other FF representation. Please give me someone else; Tidus, Noctis, Kain, Terra, FF14 player character, anyone.
Hades the god? Or Hades Zagreus
    Hades the gods from Kid Icarus
        the only wrong answer 😔
            You clearly haven’t played uprising
Zagreus would have been insane.

Unless you mean Hades from Disney's Hercules 😏
+1 for Urbosa. Super cool character that could have a super cool moveset. It could coincide with the release of BotW 2, too.
*edit

Crash Tifa Hades Mommy
1000% down for Hades, I’d love an Indie pack, with like, Hollow Knight, Hades, Shovel Knight, and Miriam (from Bloodstained)
Chibi Robo is such an obvious pick IMO, can't believe he hasn't been added yet
    He’s in a fan made game called super smash flash, it’s a computer game tho
    Chibi-Robo had been my most wanted character for years. As for my other three, well, they'd have pretty much no chance of ever getting in, but it's my fantasy list so:

2 - Geno (I've given up hope that it will ever happen at this point)

3 - Hat Kid

4 - Mike Haggar
Darknut as in the Legend of Zelda semi-common enemy?

I'd rather Vaati or Tetra personally.
I think the gore would have to go away completely, but the violence could realistically stay in. We already have some impaling moves (byleth & joker up b) and some anatomically challenging (krool and incin up throw) so without gore I think “Mr. Guy” doesn’t need too much adjustment to his existing arsenal.
I’ve always wanted doom guy but what could possibly make up an entire move set. In the games he does glory kills and uses guns.

Keep in mind he needs 16 unique attacks and not all of them can be ranged and not sure how the bit of up close combat in Doom would translate

Edit: they could pull it off but it would take a good amount of creative liberties
    I've thought about this a lot since Doomguy/Slayer was my most wanted character, I think the best way to go about it would be to translate thing like his chainsaw, Doomblade, and glory kills to standard attacks and grabs, with his specials being more centered on his ranged weapons.
        The super shotgun can also be treated as a short range move instead of a projectile.
            Could work pretty nicely as an F-Smash
Doom Guy is Just the Echo of Isabelle while Isabelle becomes the echo of sephiroth
Holy shit, someone else that wants a resident evil rep.
To the dr eggman point I think dr wily would be up there as a super iconic gaming villain.
    True, he's definitely up there, but he's not on the same level as Bowser, Eggman, Ganon, and Sephiroth. Maybe the one just below that though.
I love Majora's Mask, it's my second favorite Zelda game, but I would personally be disappointed to get Skull Kid. Majora's Mask already has a stage and Young Link to represent it. I'd like to see a BotW rep.
Skull kid would be cool
4th space goes to Gigachadpon Riku and Manana.
    Riku get job done right
        *This is bad, Noah!*
            *Now we see real Nopon potential!*
                *This might be too much for one Nopon...*
                    *But not for two!*
4th place is clearly only for the one and only man of the sea, Triton
EDWARD KENWAY FUCK YEAH
    He'd be so dope
        Yeah although ezio would prob have a way better change of getting in
            Ezio is more iconic but Ed is a better character
BRUH I SAID KRATOS AND 2B ALSO
    Great minds think alike
Midna would be fuckin dope
    Would be, but they'd probably make her cursed and combine her with Wolf Link to replicate Duck Hunt.
        ☹️
Shy guy is an interesting choice
    A cool three-in-one character could be Goomba, Koopa Troopa, and Shy Guy as some kind of a Mario Enemy Trio
        pkmn trainer esque or all three at once?
        Ah yes Corporal Paraplonk, Private Goomp & Sergeant Guy.  An odd Rep considering how long ago Mario and Luigi Inside Story came out but I support them.
        That would be so sick
            Id prefer, a Monster Hunter Main character that switches between 3 or 4 weapon types with full armor swaps with the weapons would be the shit. Like pokemon trainer, but instead of swapping between pokemon, your character does a quick "sailor moon-like" transformation into different armor and weapons with different movesets. Each color palette swap is just a different looking character, so you can pick the one you prefer the most.
As long as black Shy Guy is one of the options
No instead of the imposter we should get Barry Steakfries
I hate you but also very good choices
Wow, 4 indie reps. Huh.
OR THE HUNTER FROM BLOODBORNE!
    I dont need britain colonizing smash
    THIS GAME'S WINNER IS *hoonter*
Solaire of Astora?
    I definitely agree Solaire would be the best Fromsoftware rep
        They could do like Hero and Bowser Jr, have the player character and each alt be DeS, DS1,2,3, Elden Ring armour
Sekiro would work sooo freaking good with smash. There's so much variety in his moves in the og game. Grapple up b, shuriken neutral b, axe side b, umbrella down b.  Spear f smash, firecrackers down smash, flame up smash. 
But what would be his FS tho?
    Immortal severance, he just fucking chops your head off.
    I'm not entirely sure. Maybe his final smash will call the demon of hatred. Just call it down and it's pretty much like a glorified assist trophy. 

Or Genichiro or Isshin could do their lighting attack and sekiro could catch it and and redirect it at whoever is caught in the smash. Maybe if it's not a cut scene smash, it could be like Bowser's where you could aim it. So you use the final smash and Sekiro grapples to a platform (like Pokemon trainer on FD or Battlefield). And then you aim it. When you press it it does a little cutscene where he jumps, catches the lighting and boom.

But overall I love your moveset idea, I am kind of bummed he isn't in the game now lol
    His jab or ftilt could be his regular combo, he'd have a crawl, which could make him go invisible which would pay homage to the fact that hes a shinobi
I like the Isaac from Golden Sun idea.
Making the mother of all SMASH roster here, Jack, can't fret over every pick
Hornet when silksong releases for marketing
Behead would be insane to see!

Neutral b: Multiple-Nocks Bow

Down B: Cudgel (parry/timed reflector)

Jabs: Balanced Blade

Ftilt: Spartan Sandals

Dtilt: Hayabusa Boots (different animation)

Up B: Infantry Grenade (makes up for poor recovery with 2 midair jumps for 3 jumps in total)

Dair: Slam attack (nearly suicide off stage)

Nair: Panchaku

Fsmash: Nutcracker

Dsmash: Telluric Shock (slightly modified) 

Usmash: Broadsword (different animation)

Final Smash: Cursed Sword (deals insane damage and msu even kill at 0% but if he whiffs it there’s some recovery and if he gets hit at all during the the animation he immediately dies. 

You already know what his intro animation and logo would be. 


Or throw everything I said out the window and make him weird like Hero and Steve and give him access to nearly every weapon
Beheaded has opportunity for the most interesting move set ever
This is a good one, I agree
Someone’s a capcom fan
I feel it would be more likely for akuma to get in as he could be a echo/semi-clone of ryu or be like alph
Sandbag let's gooo
Here’s a rebuttal to your DOOM comment: Master Chief. Not more but almost there
Terra rocks, but I don't think we'd need any more ff reps.
OH, I like this idea!
I've wanted isaac or felix since brawl. Too bad golden sun is so niche now
Knunckles yeaaah
I like your style
*Everyone liked that
I’d swap Eirika out for Ephraim and Eliwood out for Hector. Would be cool to get FE reps who wielded something other than swords. Obviously I don’t feel that way about Lyn because she is my queen.
    the joke was that i picked exclusively sword lords
It's smashin' time.
What are your thoughts about getting Albert Wesker instead of Nemesis
I hate camilla with a burning passion but i am so starved for FE characters that does not use a sword that i will take it lmao.
Or just 4mii thicc echos
    No just one but he’s super wide
I like your picks.
I also like your picks.
Make the FE rep a swordie too, for extra salt.

Maybe even make sure they have blue hair and would have a similar moveset to Marth.
    Give him tippers, too
This guy’s good
As long as he has his appearance from megaman zero series as an option I'd pick zero as my number 1.
    His mmz moveset would be nice too
Just give the Miis the ability to use Miitopia wigs, makeup, and some new classes.
While demoman might work technically best, I feel like heavy deserves the spot the most.
I’d say Jack Frost is who I would pick for shin megami tensei
The Undertale rep will be Papyrus’s Bed
Love the Noah and Mio pick. Hypothetically, if they were a fighter, I wonder how Interlinking would be implemented. What I mean is, would it be tied to a move like their down b, or would it be a meter in a similar fashion to something like Arsene?
OMG I wasn't expecting to see Aran here! Now I'm imaging a hilarious moveset
    It would be funny as hell!

Though I wont accept any inclusion of him without a secret taunt where he goes: "Ye probably got cheesburgers in your gloves have ya Mac!?" When he's in a match with Little Mac


In Punch Out, he's got lots of numbers 7 in his match

*You get 7 stamina points.*

*When you intercept his punch, you can hit him 7 times.*

*If he goes down, he always gets back up at 7 seconds during the countdown.*

*There's a challenge in exhibition mode where you have to hit Aran with 7 Star Punches*


He's also a dirty boxer (nr.1 in total rulebreaks)

*Headbutts*

*Elbows*

*Asking Mac to hit him*

*Horseshoes in his boxing gloves*

*Boxing glove on a rope*


So let's implement that by doing some things like

*When Aran got the number 7 in his percentage, he deals more damage. (Maybe a horseshoe that appears in his gloves at that percentage?)*

*If there are 7 people in a match, he 'll have some nice easter egg maybe.*

*Attacks that implement his headbutts, elbows,...*

*Make the "Asking to get hit" into a counter maybe?*

*Boxing glove on a rope can be used as a ranged weapon or like a teather up-b like Min-Min. (Or both?)*


Just a few ideas, hope you like 'em.
        Yea, punch out is loaded with little secrets like the lucky 7s. I'd love those things as a moveset for him, especially the tether glove. Personally, I'd think it would be funny if in stamina mode, Aran threw an attack with the glove on a string as he went down, and if the opponent went down to it,  Aran would take priority.
            Omg that would be so funny!

Not enough Waluigi
    I would also like to replace every character with waluigi
        Now I start to understand you
    All of the Waluigi's Echo fighters are also Waluigi.
        I think all items in game should be replaced with waluigi assist trophy
            All fighters are replaced with Waluigi as well and the game's title is changed to "Super Waluigi Bros."

Acne link for sure
I would actually cry if Kevin from Home Alone 2: Lost in New York got added
They stopped cause sakurai has a unhealthy obsession with working on smash
    Well, couldn't the rest of the devs take a temporary creative director to make the characters and just touch bases every so often to make sure they're doing it right? That's what the creators of the Clone Wars did with George Lucas, they just made sure what they were planning was okay and kept rolling with it, and that show came out amazing
        Sakurai is a very I-need-to-be-there-and-do-it-myself kind of guy. While they could do that, I doubt sakurai would agree to it
Man getting more VN characters in Smash would be really nice
Archer would be sick af

Tho ngl I'm pretty sure if they would take someone from fate they would take saber

Pain
I’d honestly think Rillaboom would be a better fit. We have gotten the gen 6 water starter and the Gen 7 Fire starter
Orisa not Reinhardt?

Orisa not anyone else at all really?
Deoxys would be FIRE
    Exactly! Idk why people don’t suggest it. He could have a variety mixup move set as well which fits with all of his forms.
Astro boy is from an anime, you know
    It was actually a manga series in the 1950s-60s. But it was one of the first televised anime shows in Japan
Big fan of wii fit balance board
Who the fuck is Mario
    i think he's luigi's brother, from the first super luigi game on the nes. he's kind of obscure so i dont think he could get in
        AKA red Luigi
            there's a reason I hold a love/hate relationship with this meme
    Chris Pratt.
        You mean Bob Hoskins?
    Wahoo
    You know how sometimes people are referred to by their last name? well luigis last name is Mario, so they're referring to luigi
    Everyone knows that Mario is cool as fuck.
I know. Dr. Mario was easily the most-deserving inclusion in the entire game, but Regular Mario? GTFO, he's super-unimportant.
    I hate this meme
        I hate this world

    Regular Mario is such a niche character like who honestly cares
A propeller suit alt would be awesome.
Pink gold peach for smash!
Nah we need Gold Mario smh
    Oh, we can't go getting too greedy now
Let's see:

* Alph as an Olimar Echo (no longer just an alt.)
* Impa as a Sheik Echo
* Octoling as an Inkling Echo
* Black Shadow as Captain Falcon/Ganondorf Echo?
    The lack of octolings as an alt for inkling is probably my biggest disappointment with the character
        It's easy to understand why there weren't any Octoling alts. for Inkling, because Inkling already has male and female alts. Adding Octoling on top of that would mean there'd only be 4 Inklings, and given how colorful and diverse Inklings can be in Splatoon, I think that was the smart choice.

Additionally, Octolings were really only basic enemies until Octo Expansion, where one of them (Agent 8) became playable in that story, before becoming playable in regular matches upon beating it. And Octo Expansion was most-likely released too late for Sakurai to even consider them as playable fighters.
            I mean there’s 4 alts for Steve….
                That’s different tho, the legacy edition Steve skins aren’t as sought after and they already got the best alts for Steve and Alex
                    Tuxedo was and still is my favorite Steve Alex skins
            Just make one alt the male and one the female octoling and give them colors we don’t use yet.
            Doesn’t little Mac have 16 alts
    black shadow with ganon moveset and then make ganon a real character
        That's what I was gonna say! Like honestly, remove Black Shadow swords and give them something more like what they'd have in F0 (I've never played or watched any of this game so idk). Give Ganon something that's far more Zelda inspired
            The current moveset is ok. Falcon is also fully smash based. But change side special, flame choke is literally the only thing that's actually based out of something.
                Doesn't he falcon punch in the anime?
                    The anime came after smash.
                Yah, and I love the fact that the ganon we have is a heavy hitter that just feeeels like a villain, but it would be nice to have some Zelda inspired move sets. Maybe a magic ganon moveset and then a power based one?
        YES!!!!!
    I was thinking, Dry Bowser as a less heavy and “sharper” version of bowser would be cool, and iill tell you what I mean by “sharper”. So, he doesn’t deal more knockback on moves, maybe he even deals less, but he deals more damage nonetheless (the knockback is reduced so that it comes out even on average when damage is considered). If this didn’t work, I guess they could just make him lighter and more combo-reliant. I just like the idea of a lighter bowser as an echo
    We need Zack as a Cloud echo too
    ganondorf is already half a falcon echo so I don’t get that
        The common opinion is that it would be cool to have him as an echo that has basically ganondorf's moveset, and make ganon a new and more faithful moveset
            Yep.

Ganon in the games isn't some lumbering oaf, he's deceptively quick and has sword play equal or superior to the Hero.
    Demise as ganon echo.

Sure he might only be the villain in one single zelda game but he’s also the start of the timeline and his evil spirit is what reincarnates into Ganondorf throughout the rest of the games so adding him as an echo to ganon would be perfect.

Tbh I’d want him to be a new character all together, but even if he was an echo I’d take it
More than 4, but here's some ideas.

And I don't think Echoes should be between 2 unrelated series.

Shadow as a Sonic Echo.

Ms. Pac-Man as a Pac-Man Echo.

Jeanne as a Bayonetta Echo.

Ninten as a Ness Echo.

Impa as a Sheik Echo.

Funky Kong as a Donkey Kong Echo.

Proto Man as a Mega Man Echo.

Octoling as an Inkling Echo.

Raichu as Pikachu Echo (Same skeleton, but scaled up.)
    Honestly I'm still surprised some of these didn't get in. Many of them are really obvious, and would've required very little work.
-Funky Kong as a DK Echo

-Ms PAC Man as a PAC Man Echo

-Birdo as a Yoshi Echo

-Big Boss as a Snake Echo
    I don't see how Birdo would work as a Yoshi echo. I'd replace them with Shadow as a Sonic Echo.
Shadow as Sonics and his Homing Spin Attack can be Chaos Control and Shadow just dive kicks an enemy.

Proto man as Mega Man with different robot abilities. And a taunt to play his tune.

Zero as Cloud's echo cause he deserves it.

And I would like to see Tetra as Toon Links echo cause I think that would be fun.
Or give every single character an Echo and force them to stack.
And again I say, Ghost Dad King Rhoam as an echo on Pyra/Mythra
Going with

- Funky Kong (Donkey Kong)
- Octoling (Inkling)
- Roxas (Sora)
- Knuckles as an echo of Little Mac don’t ask me to elaborate
Let's see: 

Blaziken as a Capt Falcon Echo

Waluigi as a Wii Fit Echo 

Octoling as an Inkling Echo

Baby Mario & Baby Luigi as Ice Climber Echos
    > Waluigi as a Wii Fit Echo

So brave.

> Baby Mario & Baby Luigi as Ice Climber Echos

Put this man in charge of everything.
What about Hank Hill
Shantae, haven’t personally played the games but I know a lot of people want her in, and it seems like there’s a decent moveset opportunity
    I want her sooooo bad
The genie from Aladin, but with purple hair. Specifically Will Smiths rendition. Hope this helps.
Gotcha, you want Coco Bandicoot, Purple Guy from FNAF, Genie from Aladdin wearing a wig, and Ken Penders.
For his Neutral Special, he murders children.
    Is that an instant kill on Ness, Lucas, etc?
        Exactly. Specifically on ness, Lucas, Young Link, toon link, technically Dark Pit, and idk if there's others
            Bowser Jr and olimar.
I know olimar is not a child but I just want him to get brutally murdered
                You're absolutely right. Also, koopalings
        only if there isn't a rob or megaman nearby. then they start playing as the other fighter until hit with 3 fire attacks. then you become the secret character, Boo
I was referring to Waluigi but I should’ve put a fnaf rep lol
    Bold of you to assume Waluigi is not the purple guy.
    I- I think I prefer Waluigi
    Fnaf has impacted gaming too much to not be represented
        not really lol, it’s impacted the basic unity indie horror scene but that’s about it
            Yeah, but it got so popular and i bet a lot of popular horror games wouldn’t have been made without it

Thanks, and yeah...these are by far the best heavy hitters that are realizable, well-known, and each offer something different to the game. 

TBH I was shocked to not see any of them in FP2, I was certain we'd get Crash
    I would like 2 see Shadow instead of Eggman impo, but I like both equally.
        [deleted]
Spyro would probably be fifth choice for me
All for hollow knight characters but wouldn't Steve count as the first
    Yes and no. Minecraft use to be an indie game but after mojang was bought by Microsoft. It is now considered an triple A game, which is the time Steve got into smash.
How would he look though GG is so visually striking I feel like it would clash the ways it drawn
    They managed with everyone else, I'm sure they'd find a way.
    Considering the games we have in smash currently I don’t think he would stand out that much. I mean the closest example I can give is he doesn’t look that far off from xenoblade characters
        That's a fair point, I'm just curious hour the flair of GG would transfer over
Sol would be too similar to Terry imo 

Instead give us Faust or May since I think they would translate well and are recognisable
    Dolphin spam would be amazing for the amount of rage it would generate. May's moveset would also fit Smash well I think.
FATALITY

(+PG censorship)
Sub Zero with a freeze moveset could be a lot of fun. Bonus points if we get the OG 2D sprite Mortal Kombat versions.
I’d say Scorpion for sure!
Sub Zero would work well.  Scorpion might be a bit violent, but freezing can be done in a very PG way
I feel like it'd be super cursed but I would love to see Zato in Smash

Faust would also be interesting
    give me May or give me death 🐬
        to 🐬

tsu 🐬

ge 🐬

ki 🐬
    Granted, he's now an echo of Rosalina
        It's not quite negative inputs but I'll take it
I played his games as a kid, loved them. It’s that simple for me
    Oh yeah so did I. I didn't even mean that you specifically aren't being genuine. Your comment was just the one that the thought finally crossed my mind that not everyone who is commenting it here can possibly mean it sincerely. 😂 My bad if it came off like it was directed at you specifically.
Oof, the Shoto match up would be rough
    shakunetsu !
This is outrageous! It's unfair! How can you make an edgy pack without Shadow the Hedgehog!
    Assist trophy hell.
    The lack of a shadow echo is kinda lame tbh. They could change quite a few skills as well to suit him more, and of course;

Gun
Lmao. Literally all edgelords
Raiden has been in the series since Metal Gear Solid 2.
    I'M THE BUG INSIDE YOU!!!
    while true people would want him from mgr not from mgs 2
        I'd like the Metal Gear Solid 4 version personally.
            If he did get added I feel he would have the mgs4 as a palette option like for half of them maybe or if i could have it the best way id like all his putfits from mgr and a few mgs4 based ones aswell.
And is also a falling father figure 🤭
    Don’t forget Poland’s Prime Minister.
    get out lol
But she'd have two VERY compelling reasons to put her in the game...
Hades the gods from Kid Icarus
    the only wrong answer 😔
        You clearly haven’t played uprising
He’s in a fan made game called super smash flash, it’s a computer game tho
Chibi-Robo had been my most wanted character for years. As for my other three, well, they'd have pretty much no chance of ever getting in, but it's my fantasy list so:

2 - Geno (I've given up hope that it will ever happen at this point)

3 - Hat Kid

4 - Mike Haggar
I've thought about this a lot since Doomguy/Slayer was my most wanted character, I think the best way to go about it would be to translate thing like his chainsaw, Doomblade, and glory kills to standard attacks and grabs, with his specials being more centered on his ranged weapons.
    The super shotgun can also be treated as a short range move instead of a projectile.
        Could work pretty nicely as an F-Smash
True, he's definitely up there, but he's not on the same level as Bowser, Eggman, Ganon, and Sephiroth. Maybe the one just below that though.
Riku get job done right
    *This is bad, Noah!*
        *Now we see real Nopon potential!*
            *This might be too much for one Nopon...*
                *But not for two!*
He'd be so dope
    Yeah although ezio would prob have a way better change of getting in
        Ezio is more iconic but Ed is a better character
Great minds think alike
Would be, but they'd probably make her cursed and combine her with Wolf Link to replicate Duck Hunt.
    ☹️
A cool three-in-one character could be Goomba, Koopa Troopa, and Shy Guy as some kind of a Mario Enemy Trio
    pkmn trainer esque or all three at once?
    Ah yes Corporal Paraplonk, Private Goomp & Sergeant Guy.  An odd Rep considering how long ago Mario and Luigi Inside Story came out but I support them.
    That would be so sick
        Id prefer, a Monster Hunter Main character that switches between 3 or 4 weapon types with full armor swaps with the weapons would be the shit. Like pokemon trainer, but instead of swapping between pokemon, your character does a quick "sailor moon-like" transformation into different armor and weapons with different movesets. Each color palette swap is just a different looking character, so you can pick the one you prefer the most.
I dont need britain colonizing smash
THIS GAME'S WINNER IS *hoonter*
I definitely agree Solaire would be the best Fromsoftware rep
    They could do like Hero and Bowser Jr, have the player character and each alt be DeS, DS1,2,3, Elden Ring armour
Immortal severance, he just fucking chops your head off.
I'm not entirely sure. Maybe his final smash will call the demon of hatred. Just call it down and it's pretty much like a glorified assist trophy. 

Or Genichiro or Isshin could do their lighting attack and sekiro could catch it and and redirect it at whoever is caught in the smash. Maybe if it's not a cut scene smash, it could be like Bowser's where you could aim it. So you use the final smash and Sekiro grapples to a platform (like Pokemon trainer on FD or Battlefield). And then you aim it. When you press it it does a little cutscene where he jumps, catches the lighting and boom.

But overall I love your moveset idea, I am kind of bummed he isn't in the game now lol
His jab or ftilt could be his regular combo, he'd have a crawl, which could make him go invisible which would pay homage to the fact that hes a shinobi

Sure he might only be the villain in one single zelda game but he’s also the start of the timeline and his evil spirit is what reincarnates into Ganondorf throughout the rest of the games so adding him as an echo to ganon would be perfect.

Tbh I’d want him to be a new character all together, but even if he was an echo I’d take it
Honestly I'm still surprised some of these didn't get in. Many of them are really obvious, and would've required very little work.
I don't see how Birdo would work as a Yoshi echo. I'd replace them with Shadow as a Sonic Echo.
> Waluigi as a Wii Fit Echo

So brave.

> Baby Mario & Baby Luigi as Ice Climber Echos

Put this man in charge of everything.
I want her sooooo bad
Is that an instant kill on Ness, Lucas, etc?
    Exactly. Specifically on ness, Lucas, Young Link, toon link, technically Dark Pit, and idk if there's others
        Bowser Jr and olimar.
I know olimar is not a child but I just want him to get brutally murdered
            You're absolutely right. Also, koopalings
    only if there isn't a rob or megaman nearby. then they start playing as the other fighter until hit with 3 fire attacks. then you become the secret character, Boo
Bold of you to assume Waluigi is not the purple guy.
I- I think I prefer Waluigi
Fnaf has impacted gaming too much to not be represented
    not really lol, it’s impacted the basic unity indie horror scene but that’s about it
        Yeah, but it got so popular and i bet a lot of popular horror games wouldn’t have been made without it

Yes and no. Minecraft use to be an indie game but after mojang was bought by Microsoft. It is now considered an triple A game, which is the time Steve got into smash.
They managed with everyone else, I'm sure they'd find a way.
Considering the games we have in smash currently I don’t think he would stand out that much. I mean the closest example I can give is he doesn’t look that far off from xenoblade characters
    That's a fair point, I'm just curious hour the flair of GG would transfer over
Dolphin spam would be amazing for the amount of rage it would generate. May's moveset would also fit Smash well I think.

Granted, he's now an echo of Rosalina
    It's not quite negative inputs but I'll take it
Oh yeah so did I. I didn't even mean that you specifically aren't being genuine. Your comment was just the one that the thought finally crossed my mind that not everyone who is commenting it here can possibly mean it sincerely. 😂 My bad if it came off like it was directed at you specifically.
shakunetsu !
Assist trophy hell.
The lack of a shadow echo is kinda lame tbh. They could change quite a few skills as well to suit him more, and of course;

Gun
I'M THE BUG INSIDE YOU!!!
while true people would want him from mgr not from mgs 2
    I'd like the Metal Gear Solid 4 version personally.
        If he did get added I feel he would have the mgs4 as a palette option like for half of them maybe or if i could have it the best way id like all his putfits from mgr and a few mgs4 based ones aswell.
Don’t forget Poland’s Prime Minister.
get out lol
the only wrong answer 😔
    You clearly haven’t played uprising
The super shotgun can also be treated as a short range move instead of a projectile.
    Could work pretty nicely as an F-Smash
*This is bad, Noah!*
    *Now we see real Nopon potential!*
        *This might be too much for one Nopon...*
            *But not for two!*
Yeah although ezio would prob have a way better change of getting in
    Ezio is more iconic but Ed is a better character
☹️
pkmn trainer esque or all three at once?
Ah yes Corporal Paraplonk, Private Goomp & Sergeant Guy.  An odd Rep considering how long ago Mario and Luigi Inside Story came out but I support them.
That would be so sick
    Id prefer, a Monster Hunter Main character that switches between 3 or 4 weapon types with full armor swaps with the weapons would be the shit. Like pokemon trainer, but instead of swapping between pokemon, your character does a quick "sailor moon-like" transformation into different armor and weapons with different movesets. Each color palette swap is just a different looking character, so you can pick the one you prefer the most.
They could do like Hero and Bowser Jr, have the player character and each alt be DeS, DS1,2,3, Elden Ring armour
Yea, punch out is loaded with little secrets like the lucky 7s. I'd love those things as a moveset for him, especially the tether glove. Personally, I'd think it would be funny if in stamina mode, Aran threw an attack with the glove on a string as he went down, and if the opponent went down to it,  Aran would take priority.
    Omg that would be so funny!
Now I start to understand you
I think all items in game should be replaced with waluigi assist trophy
    All fighters are replaced with Waluigi as well and the game's title is changed to "Super Waluigi Bros."
        Super Smash Waluigi

It's easy to understand why there weren't any Octoling alts. for Inkling, because Inkling already has male and female alts. Adding Octoling on top of that would mean there'd only be 4 Inklings, and given how colorful and diverse Inklings can be in Splatoon, I think that was the smart choice.

Additionally, Octolings were really only basic enemies until Octo Expansion, where one of them (Agent 8) became playable in that story, before becoming playable in regular matches upon beating it. And Octo Expansion was most-likely released too late for Sakurai to even consider them as playable fighters.
    I mean there’s 4 alts for Steve….
        That’s different tho, the legacy edition Steve skins aren’t as sought after and they already got the best alts for Steve and Alex
            Tuxedo was and still is my favorite Steve Alex skins
    Just make one alt the male and one the female octoling and give them colors we don’t use yet.
    Doesn’t little Mac have 16 alts
That's what I was gonna say! Like honestly, remove Black Shadow swords and give them something more like what they'd have in F0 (I've never played or watched any of this game so idk). Give Ganon something that's far more Zelda inspired
    The current moveset is ok. Falcon is also fully smash based. But change side special, flame choke is literally the only thing that's actually based out of something.
        Doesn't he falcon punch in the anime?
            The anime came after smash.
        Yah, and I love the fact that the ganon we have is a heavy hitter that just feeeels like a villain, but it would be nice to have some Zelda inspired move sets. Maybe a magic ganon moveset and then a power based one?
YES!!!!!
The common opinion is that it would be cool to have him as an echo that has basically ganondorf's moveset, and make ganon a new and more faithful moveset
    Yep.

Ganon in the games isn't some lumbering oaf, he's deceptively quick and has sword play equal or superior to the Hero.
Exactly. Specifically on ness, Lucas, Young Link, toon link, technically Dark Pit, and idk if there's others
