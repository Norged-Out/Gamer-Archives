[[Which Character are you glad that DID NOT made it in Why]]

Post Content:
For me, it’s Clones & Anime characters with swords! 
(Nah, kidding), that’s too easy of an answer. I suppose if I had to pick who I’m happy that didn’t made it in is Shadow. Why? Cuz shadow would be probably be a Clone of Sonic, and Sonic’s Moves is just Spin attacks. 

Comments:
And for Shadow’s Neutral B, he wields a gun.
    Nah he would wield that DAMM 4th chaos emerald
        That’s his down B
            YO! Shadow Down b being Chaos Control (like Meta Knight's cape) sounds awesome
                Isn't that more like Witch Time?
                    Chaos Control can both warp and slow time. And I don't think anyone, even Sonic players, want Witch Time Sonic.
                        Ah well, he does do both as an Assist Trophy
                        *coughs and raises finger* Well.......some of us might :P
                        Your a Ridley main so shut up. U dont know what Sonic players want, while i know cause im one
                Dude I want shadow to have an Up B be a chaos control that spikes at the end of the hotbox like in his trailer on the alien lol
    If he shoots you. HE KILLS YOU
James Bond I think is the most objective answer, he was planned for Melee

If he got in the Smash roster today would look a LOT different, and lose some of its charm tbh
    For his neutral special, he wields a gun.

For his down special, he wields the golden gun
    James Bond is a character that would've given Nintendo cold feet for licensing sooner or later. If they'd gotten anywhere with the character, even really late, he probably would've turned into Joanna from Perfect Dark.
        Barbara Broccoli and the Fleming estate are both NOTORIOUSLY picky about James Bond depictions outside of the books and movies. I feel like they would not like him being in a game where he can be thrown out of the ring by a monkey with a jet pack.
            IDK, I could totally see that scene being in one of the Moore films lol
                Well, yeah. Cubby Broccoli didn’t give a shit about bond’s image. I’m certain he would have been a-ok with Bond in Smash. The dude made Diamonds are Forever.
            “Barbara Broccoli”???
                Yes. She’s currently in charge of making James Bond films. The Bond films are actually a family business she inherited from her father, Albert Broccoli. Goldeneye was actually her debut film.
        i kinda would have liked to see joana dark make it in though. The 2 classic game genres that immediately come to mind as not having reps are FPS's and beat em ups (the latter being very surprising actually).
            Sadly FPS ain't that popular (if at all) in Japan
                For now, the only fps character represented in Smash is Mario. Just because he's a representative of EVERY genre.
                    I don't remember Mario ever being in an FPS. Samus, on the other hand, has a few.
                        Yoshi's Safari.

And I did forget about Metroid Prime, my mistake.
    I don’t think he was ever seriously considered for Melee. He did well in the “If there were a Smash 2” poll but that didn’t take licensing into account. Sakurai never pitched him in a design doc or anything like that.

The team likely knew it wasn’t going to happen. The sale of Rare to Microsoft already made tons of content iffy. Things like the rebranding of the motion-sensor bomb away from Perfect Dark and the lack of a Diddy Kong trophy are examples of this. HAL were unsure exactly what Nintendo would and would not have the rights to use after the sale.

I believe if we got a Rare character, priority would’ve been given to Banjo and Kazooie.
        Sakurai confirmed in an interview that Bond was at the bare minimum brought up during discussions, meaning he wasn’t out of the question, though you are right in that he probably didn’t progress much past that
            Well of course he'd get brought up, Goldeneye 64 is one of the iconic games of the N64.

The discussion could've just been something like *'hey here's why we aren't going to have James Bond as a playable character despite Goldeneye 64 being a super well known N64 game.'*
                The wording of the interview (I wish I could find the source but I was unable to) made it sound less like a “Here’s why he won’t be added” and more of a “We were considering adding him”

I feel like it’s kind of the inverse of the Snake in Melee situation where something happened that made it so it couldn’t happen for Melee and by the time Brawl rolled around they had their rules more set in stone
        >I believe if we got a Rare character, priority would’ve been given to Banjo and Kazooie.

Thank goodness that didn't happen
    The final smash is shaken, not stirring his opponents.
    Could you imagine the speculation nightmare Smash would be if James Bond got in
        A few characters that are highly likely to have gotten in if that happened are Spider-Man, Goku, TMNT, and a few others I’m sure I’m forgetting

Just… thank god that didn’t happen, as much as I’d love a character *like* James Bond, the actual James Bond isn’t it
        We still get people begging for Goku and Shrek and whoever else though, so it wouldn't be much difference though.
    This is the answer
        All of the answers are *the* answers
            ![gif](giphy|uPnKU86sFa2fm)
Cuphead. I ain’t fighting Megaman with DLC balancing
    Add him to the Base game for 6!
        damn he not getting in until the 720th game
    What makes you think they would balance him like Steve and kazuya as opposed to literally all of the rest of the DLC? lol
        Not all the DLC are top tier but a lot have ‘gimmicks’ and comeback mechanics that people don’t really like. For example banjo and sora are ‘dlc balanced’ and while they’re not overpowered many people don’t really enjoy fighting those characters.
            I don't enjoy fighting sora because of his voice and it giving me PTSD from the countless hours I put into the first two KH games hahah
        You mean like Aegis, Joker, or Min Min, all of which have good arguments for being better than Kazuya?
            I don't think Minmin is top tier.  Joker and aegis are definitely up there.
                min min is the bayonetta of japan come on now
    Yea I would agree
    Pete from that Steamboat Willie game will show up to balance him out
I WAS happy that Spring Man didn’t make it in, but we ended up getting Min Min anyways (for extra money too)
    At least Min Min has a more interesting personality
        You say that, but Spring Man's showed more personality in Min Min's own Smash reveal than Min Min has in her entire existence.

I like Min Min and all, but I genuinely cannot see how people say she has more personality than Spring Man, who honestly has more personality than most other ARMS characters.
            I was hoping for the black chick. Get some sexy chocolate in the game
                What a fucking weird thing to say
                I don't know, it's the same character that fights woth her hair... in a game named ARMS.
                    It would be messed up if some other hair based fighter got in first before Dixie.

Edit: No wait, forgot about Bayo. Crap.
    I never played ARMS, but I really like the look of DNA Man. He seemed so silly and amusing. I felt like an ARMS rep was inevitable for Ultimate, so I was hoping it would be him.
     i wanted an ARMS character since day one and then it ended up being horrible and on top of that we were so close to getting Ninjara
Cinderace
    he would be fast and his main game play would be zoning.
        Yeah it would be sonic with charge shot lol
        I don't think he would be a zoner. His signature move is a projectile, and he is a soccer player, but he's also mainly a physically attacker in Pokémon, and would probably be more of a brawler in smash.
            A fire type starter Pokemon who's mainly a brawler you say? What a unique idea.
                This is the main reason I don't want Cinderace in Smash - we already have Incineroar, we don't need Incineroar but a rabbit with a football! And if the Smash team were considering making, for example, a faster, combo-based fire starter for instance, there are other fire starters that fit that bill considerably better than Cinderace, namely Blaziken and Infernape, and if they wanted a ranged fire starter, Delphox (or even Braixen if you want to cater to a certain subset of fans) would be a much better pick
            I see him being a better Greninja, maybe not as fast as ninja, but a good singular projectile to control space, and some good CQ moves, maybe a comeback mechanic, like a Z move (would say gigantamax but idk how that would translate to the game, probably more of a final smash.)
    Agreed but that's because I consider it to be the worst Gen 8 starter
        Probably doesn't help he came from a lineup of Final Evos that are basically just furries.

I know it's already kinda iffy, considering the existence of others like Delphox and Incineroar among others, but Gen 8 was like the creme de la creme of final evos being furries.
            Rillaboom was just a gorilla though.

Yeah, gorillas are primates and therefore look somewhat humanoid, but he still looked like an actual gorilla and not a anthropomorphized one.
                Rillaboom loses a lot of points from not being part drum
                    It's a kids' game first and foremost, they couldn't have shown him drumming on his cheeks.
                        It's a kid's game first and foremost, the main thing kids know about gorillas is that they beat their chest when fighting
            yeah but like… cinderace is cool.
    That would’ve pissed a lot of people off
    Cinderace would’ve been cool thoughhhhh
Any character that isn't from a game cause most the people who want for example Goku are very annoying
    This. I hope this is the one rule Sakurai never breaks, no matter how popular the requests are.  Smash which was originally a celebration of Nintendo characters, has evolved to be a celebration of gaming as a whole. Comprising that rule to put in a character like Shrek who originated from a movie would be funny yes, but would also make smash lose some of it’s magic if now just anyone can be added.
        What about a character like Geralt of Rivia? Sure, he started as a book character, but The Witcher 3 is a pillar of the RPG genre and definitely what he's known best from, plus he's appeared in a number of crossovers with other games before.
            Although i dont want Geralt in ssb i still think he counts since he’s from a game. A fun twist would be to add the same Disney characters that Are in the final fantasy games. Its better than someone who only appeared on the movies or in a book. 

On the other hand i would so be up for a lotr smash
                The idea is that they originated from a video game so Geralt might be best known from a game, he is not created from gaming. It's almost like saying spiderman is from the comics but best known from the MCU so therefore he's a movie character.
                    I would say that the major difference there is that when most people think of Spiderman, they think of the comics, movies, AND games, since all three are quite popular. Geralt on the other hand, despite originally being from a (excellent) book series and appearing in a (shitty) Netflix adaptation, is by all accounts considered first and foremost a video game character in popular culture.
                        Yah it's why I said "almost" about spiderman. He's not the best example but the main idea was that he did not originate from movies. Smash has a specific theme going and that theme simply was characters that originated from video games. All the non-nintendo characters originated from a video game even if they have a separate media presence like comics or anime. Smash went from a Nintendo only fighting game to a game that celebrated video gaming and it's history. Geralt's inclusion, regardless of his popularity, simply would have broken that theme.

Now the next Smash, if they wanna go all out on it, they can include whoever they want and be like a Smash version of Fortnight where everyone is included. Goku, Geralt and hell why not Hello Kitty
                            How is Geralt not part of a "celebration of gaming" though? He's a video game icon; Witcher 3 is one of the most celebrated and beloved games of the last decade, regardless of it being based on a book series. Geralt is most definitely not in the same category as the likes of Goku and Spiderman; no Dragon Ball or Spiderman game went many years being literally the most awarded game in history.
                                Dude you're not listening. He's not a video game character. He's a book character. Like Harry Potter is that also has video games that sold a shit ton. That's it. Nintendo aimed for characters that originated from video games. Geralt doesn't fit that ideal. If Nintendo wants to open the doors to book characters in the next smash, that's their choice but for Ultimate, characters that originated from video games. Geralt is a book character. End of story
                                    By that logic neither is Master Chief; technically his first appearance was in the first Halo novel that released shortly before the first game in 2001. I don't think you'd find a single person on this Earth who would call Master Chief a book character.
                    I think Dracula kinda enters that category but I guess people consider him an archetype now more than a character
    I've had people on this sub tell me Goku is better known as a video game character
        Hell nah
        Isnt that the skin from fortnite??
    Bro most people who want Goku don’t actually want him, the other half are brain dead delusional people. 

If you want Goku so bad, go play Smash Flash or Jump Ultimate Stars.
    This. The moment they get in, no matter how many "It's just a one-off"s that are used. It would get to the point where NOBODY IS OFF-LIMITSI mean do you want to see Hentai protag #29858 join Smash? Or how about Slasher villain #51?

(not saying names, but you get my point. If LITERALLY ANYONE can become a fighter it would bump the rating up exponentially)
    Sorry, they already broke that with sonic, snake, pit, and  probably some more I don't know of.




EDIT: also goku is in games. Hes in a shit ton of games, hell one is about to release.
        I wanna know what kind of logic you used to consider sonic, snake, and pit to be not from games
            Somic originated from comics, weeks before his game relase. The costume they use for snake originated from a comic, and pit is a character from stories (stretching)
                The sonic comics are there to promote the games, sonic is definitely a video game franchise first before anything
        Hey genius I have to go written it from a game and primarily play in games
            I'm assuming you mean they are primarily from games and that's why most know them? Honestly the same thing is for goku, the games are fairly popular and inteoduce tons to the story.
                If the franchise originated in a game they can be in Smash Bros anime, manga, movie, and book characters cannot be in Smash Bros unless the franchise they are from is gaming
    Isn't Goku in the DBZ fighting games tho?
        Yes, but he isn’t from that game, he’s just in it. He’s from an anime/manga.
        But he was born from a manga, not from a videogame and the only rule to join smash is that a characters must be originated from a videogame (only exception is lucario)
            even then you could argue that lucario really is from pokemon and therefore "deserves" to be in

besides, it's a nintendo character. they are able to whatever tf they want with their characters
            Nah, Lucario is a video game character who had non-video game material release first, but mostly to promote the games he originated from, so he’s still a game character. Like Lightning McQueen appeared in the Cars game before he did for the Cars movie, but that doesn’t make him a video game character. 

I think the only real exception is Greninja, since the one in smash is canonically Ash-Greninja, and Ash is an anime character. Ash-Greninja does appear later in SuMo, but it’s only promotional material for the anime. An *almost* exception is Sephiroth, who Sakurai refers to as the Advent Children Sephiroth, with his design and mechanics being based off AC and his inclusion coming with tracks from the movie, which is pretty crazy.

There’s also other non-fighter exceptions, Goldeneye is referenced from 64-Brawl, with the motion sensor item being directly pulled from it in 64 and Melee. The assist trophy, Dr. Kawashima, is an actual real person. Mickey’s on Sora’s keychain.. and there’s probably some spirits ?
            wait how is lucario an exception lmao
                Because his first appearence was in a 2005 film
                    Nope! He cameoed in PMD Red and Blue rescue team a few months before the film.
        They mean characters that didn’t originate from a game
        There's plenty of Dragon Ball games
            They have to be ORIGINALLY from a game not a game after its manga and anime.
Any movie character. It would kill the vibe and meaning of a « video game fighting game »
    And by that same logic, anime characters. Looking at you Goku
        I think Dragon Ball characters are one of the few exceptions because of the Budokai Tenkaichi series being such an iconic fighting game

The Dragon Ball franchise has had a handful of very strong video-game entries and has definitely left a decent mark in the industry. I'd go as far as to confidently say that the Xenoverse games are more iconic than the entirety of Bayonetta.

Yes, I believe Goku would fit right into Smash, and I want him in the game as a fighter.
    Do Mario and Sonic technically count as movie characters? They have movies
        No. Mario and Sonic video game characters that have appeared in movies, not movie characters that have appeared in video games. You can flip your question on its head and ask if Superman and Goku count as video game characters because they appear in games.
        I’m talking about characters originating from movies and tv. Mario and Sonic do not
The Rabbids
    They would work as a funny assist trophy or a stage hazard tbh
        Rayman as playable and Rabbids as assist trophy would be neat
            Rayman as playable and rabbids as polygon mans would gorgeous.


Could you imagine ? 


Beating the crap out of them for hours ?
    Yea f those guys
    If we got Rabbids before Ray-Man? That would be a travesty
    I’d rather have the Minions from Despicable Me
Twintelle

We don't need MinMin with witch time. Also she is the only character from a game called ARMS who doesn't use her arms so it would be weird to have the ARMS rep not use arms.
    they only want Twintelle for her ass
        They want the thicc waifu
            Yes
        i can attest this is the main reason i wanted her in.
    There is a character who uses a mechsuit, but the mechsuit has arms. Not sure if that counts.
        She was the second on ARMS characters who I didn't want in because she technically doesn't use her arms as she doesn't have ARMS, but it is less egregious that Twintelle's lack of using her arms.
    [removed]
        [removed]
            EXACTLY.
            [removed]
        Did people actually say that?
            Yes they did

Tbf I do agree that Smash should have more black characters in it, but I'd rather not have an ARMS character with Witch Time.
                Well that's a wider problem with just a lack of black characters in gaming anyway.
                I don’t know why people were expecting her. She was the only one deconfirmed when it was announced that an ARMS character was coming.
            I saw some people who did, on Resetera specifically. Min Min was announced during the height of the protests against George Floyd's death, so people were hyper-aware about racial issues. Obviously there were a 100 issues with the train of thought. Twintelle doesn't use her arms and would have been an ill-fitting representation of ARMS as a result, Twintelle was mainly popular because of her ass, Min Min had good merits in her favor as the ARMS choice, Min Min was in development long before George Floyd died. And most importantly, an apolitical Japanese company is not going to change Smash Bros. DLC plans as a response to an American socio-political issue...
            they say that to not telt the thuth that they only want Twintelle for her ass
Charizard as a solo character, the Pokemon trainer mechanics and different uses are a lot more interesting.
    but the fact thar he was the only (i think) character to not return in the ‘everybody returns’ game was kinda sad. still missing rock smash 💔
        The three Pokemon have individual fighter numbers on [Nintendo's website](https://www.smashbros.com/en_US/fighter) (Charizard is #35), so I think he still counts as returning
        I think him returning as part of Pokemon trainer counts as him returning.
        Yeah that is fair, also nothing against him as a character in smash4, I'm just glad that if they were only gonna bring back either PT or Zard I'm glad it was PT
            with you on that one
        I feel like Solozard 100% could’ve coexisted with Red ngl
            That would be weird as shit
    Thankfully the got rid of the stupid Stamina mechanic, so anyone who wants to still use him like a solo fighter can still do so.
    but the fact that he was the only (i think) character to not return in the ‘everybody returns’ game was kinda sad. still missing rock smash 💔
Any FNAF character, especially Springtrap
    bro imagine his final smash 💀💀💀
        bro would just kill children in a nintendo game 😭
    I could see freddy as a mii brawler outfit
    Thank you. Like wtf would the moveset even be
        Theres a rivals of aether moveset and a brawlfan1 moveset that answers that exact question
    They would be sick as assist trophies tho
    They would be sick as assist trophies tho
    nuh uh
        Yuh uh, what’s the moveset? As far as I’m aware springtrap is just a dead guy who used to murder children while disguised in mascot costumes. It would be really hard to create APPROPRIATE moves from this concept.
            There is a pretty cool rivals of aether mod for springtrap, obviously not everything would fit, (namely Uair, Dair, and Bair) as well as visual changes to fit the 3d environment, but it could work. The main problem would be the potentially graphic material involving springtrap’s design. If any fnaf character made it in, it would likely be Freddy himself, rather than springtrap.
            pull from fnaf world, the movie (knife, paranormal abilities?), and phantoms as well as just technological things used in fnaf since william is an engineer and genius and bam moveset
    Agreed. And fuck Scott Cawthon.
        What did Scott do
Im really glad Steve From Minecraft didn't make it, i feel like representing the gameplay of minecraft would probably result in new, semi-gamebreaking mechanics (like what if Pac-Man could stack hydrants? That sounds lame as shit) and because they're smash developers it probably would come with a whole host of character specific bugs that more than likely will make the character a lot stronger.

Also the aesthetics and animations of a minecraft character would be so fucking boring and lame so yeah im glad fucking Steve didn't make it

Edit: guys. youre not gonna believe this.
Jonesy. Steve blocks already annoy too many people , I don't wanna here people complain about Jonesy doing fast edits in neutral...
    A Mii costume would’ve been pretty sick tho
One name: Goku
    Tell those people to go play Smash Flash or Jump Ultimate Stars
A Fortnite Rep
    Wym? We got Ryu and Snake already. A lil late to the party 🗿
        Smash bad ryu and snake before it was cool
    fortnite bad reddit chungus 100 u want ur gold already bro
        I don't care about the gameplay, fortnite is just everything I hate about corporate marketing in one game.
            I love it because it gives modders access to plenty of high quality 3d models, plenty of which have been made into smash mods.
            Yep. I know 'thing young people like = bad" is a common internet pattern, and I'm frequently guilty of it. But I see Fortnite as a soulless corporate attempt to replicate the community driven boom of Minecraft in the 2010's.
            boohoo you can play the game entirely for free but buy cool skins from other things you like so dystopian and capitalistic and terrible and scummy
                You can play the game for free until way down the road they inevitably pull the plug and since it's a live service game, that will just be the end. I despise the live service model that every modern game seems to have, especially since I have seen multiple games just become unplayable because of it. It also introduced battle passes to the gaming world which just spread like wildfire, so now every single modern game needs to have a battle pass with exclusive cosmetic items in it.
                    >It also introduced battle passes to the gaming world which just spread like wildfire

Except it didn't. That was Dota 2.
                        I'm not a fan of Dota 2 either tbh. But I never saw the influx of battle passes in other games until fortnite released.
    One of the most important and influential games in recent gaming history. Jonesy would be a great pick imo with tons of potential.
    We all know Fortnite is just going to add a platform fighter mode anyhow. Epic cannot stay in their own lane.
        Not to be rude but who cares if epic branches out their game? Keeping the game new and exciting is good for them and the industry
            No, it is not exciting for the industry.

Fortnite has the brand power to make themselves the one stop shop for all of gaming. That isn't healthy for the industry. Thats monopolistic.

No one wants a future where the best survival adventure, fps, rhythm game, fighting game, rpg, etc is a single game. You know why? Because realistically it will not be as good as what came before. It will be too spread thin, lacking nuance, well tuned gameplay, and content.

That's not to say they'll naturally succeed if they try this. They failed to dethrone Among Us as THE social deduction game.

But no, I don't think it's healthy or exciting. I prefer a game be one thing, and for it to do that one thing really well.
    That would be hella funny ngl
Super glad Fortnite doesn't have representation. On one hand it is popular and has been around a while. On the other hand it is hard carried by all the promotional crossovers it has.
    Jonesy would be terrible: imagine a mix between steve and snake, hell no!
    Jones would be so fucking unbalanced anyways, imagine Steve with guns
        Imagine Jones building a whole suburb complex to block recoveries.
        At this point Fortnitw has had so many items throughout its history they could probably make an all-melee moveset for him.
        cant wait for him to be discovered as completely broken and have to be banned from tournaments after the game stops updating in smash 6
        *rubs hands together mischievously* (I unironically love fortnite and mc tho no joke)
    Hard carried? Nah the game is just really fun, also I really find it ironic you say one game is carried by crossovers in a smash bros discussion
        Personally I don't find Fortnite fun. Also Smash crossovers are VERY different from Fortnite's. Fortnite has huge movie IPs and such while Smash is a celebration of gaming (at this point). Fortnite is a celebration of pop culture. I don't remember Smash having famous rappers, movie characters, streamers, anime characters, etc being in it. Point being, Fortnite has IP that is more recognizable to the general public. More people know about Thanos, the Xenomorph, Optimus Prime, John Wick, Batman, Joker, Superman, etc over characters like Pyra/Mythra, Joker, King K. Rool, Terry Bogard, etc. Most characters in Smash are only big in the world of gaming.
    Jonsey would be funny af
    fortnite is The Crossover Game nowadays tbh
    That is actually a legit good reason to not want it represented, as opposed to all the people who just love to hate on it because it's so popular with zoomers.
Forest Gump
    he would be a zone with his Vietnam training and his tabletennis experience, and he would be fast af.
        Bro even at 999% he would be invunerable because he just want to keep runing a little
        Why not Walter White from Breaking Bad?
    This comment section is like a box of chocolates. I never know what I’m going to get
Bubsy.
    Like he had any chance whatsoever.
        But what could possibly go wrong
            He has no pilot's license so his recovery would suck ass.
fortnite and overwatch
    If one of them HAD to make it in and it was your choice, which one?
        Gotta be overwatch, fortnite basically has no IP
        is adding chun li an option for fortnite
            Yeah but she comes in a package deal with Goku
                no goku is preferred because he has godlike powers from what ive heard and anime
        Overwatch BY A MILE
            I think Tracer could be fun, but I'm not like begging for her to get in or anything.
    I understand Fortnite but overwatch? Sau what you will about the current state of the game but the level of popularity that it reached in the game space was crazy. That franchise deserves to be in the next smash game
        yeah but tf2
    I’d hate Tracer, but Jonsey would be funny af
        look i like my zoner character and we dont need more (unless its another mega man character)
    Imagine Winton in smash another DK that would be so funny
Twintelle, she's the most overrated ARMS Character and has no personality.

For those of you who hate Min Min for being for being broken and annoying, I promise you that Twintelle is 100x worse, y'all really dodged a bullet.
    DAT ASS THO

I've got several, all that will be controversial. I'll go by series. Also, sorry in advance. I feel obligated to fully explain.

* Mario Series: Toad and Waluigi. I can see both being fun, though likely having to rely on a weird gimmick or just having a quirky moveset made of references to various items or mini games. While that can be fun, I feel like it would also potentially cause issues with showcasing their character and personality for the sake of references. Piranha Plant got away with this because it's only personality is getting goofy and biting.

* Donkey Kong Series: Dixie Kong and Funky Kong. I know many people wish for these two, but I can't see them working outside of Dixie being a Diddy echo with a variant of Donkey Kong's up special, and Funky would probably have to have a whole moveset made to showcase his dancing and surfing moves, but... I feel like it would feel like just another heavyweight brawler without anything special.

* Zelda Series: Toon Zelda and Linkle. I've seen a lot of people ask for Toon Zelda due to the data in Brawl, but if it's to Zelda what Toon Link is to Link, that's just a floatier, faster, and weaker Zelda. Not really all that interesting. As for Linkle, even if she uses more than just crossbows, I feel like she'd still end up just being a 4th Link in gameplay for the most part.

* Kirby Series: Bandana Waddle Dee. I love the Kirby series, and I'd like to see BWD in Smash, but I really cannot imagine any way for him to be fun. Just like Meta Knight and somewhat with Dedede, he'd likely just use his moveset from the Kirby series. That's basically just a lot of straight, long, tipper disjoint with a projectile variant like the Belmont Axe, a recovery like K. Rool's, and maybe a parasol to reflect or something. All that mixed with Kirby's physics would feel annoying to go against, and unfun to play as, but also probably easy to kill. Probably would also be like Inkling in lacking a certain something that makes the character hype.

* Pokémon Series: Grovyle, Sceptile, Deoxys, and Zoroark. I'll keep this one short. The first two are for the sake of "gen reps", but would likely just be a fast rush down again, or a fast brawler again, without much to stand out other than being a Pokémon. Deoxys could have worked in Ultimate with temporary transformations working like Monado, but would have also just been another Pokémon that's similar to several others. Zoroark could have actually been interesting as a speedy glass cannon with some rushdown and zoning options, but with it's signature trait being disguising itself as others and creating illusions, I fear it would have made for either a lame final smash, or too close to Lucario with Aura removed.

* Fire Emblem Series: Lyn. All I really have to say is, Marth was used as the archetype template for most of the sword users in Smash, unfortunately. (Likely due to being copied directly for development ease) I just don't think Lyn would be that fun. I can only see her being like a super fast lightweight with a long disjoint, which feels absolutely miserable to go against. Imagine if Marth had Fox's mobility, but with the reach of Monado. Absolutely miserable to go against.

* Kid Icarus Series: Magnus and Amazon Pandora. Magnus is pretty obvious. Another slow, heavyweight, and another sword user. He'd get compared to Ike too much, and would probably feel like Ganondorf but with the sword always in use. He doesn't really have anything unique to bring. Amazon Pandora, however, does have the ability to be a brawler and zoner using magic fire and such, but... That kind of ends up making her like Samus without the Morph Ball or tether, probably also lighter too. Though I have forgotten her fight, so I could be wrong.

* Wario Series: Kat & Ana, Cricket, and Mona. The first two would just be Ice Climbers but faster, lighter, and having average sword range. I cannot see that being fun to go against, nor all that interesting to watch. Cricket is just a martial artist, so he'd probably feel a lot like Mii Brawler with nothing else different. Mona... I can't see her fighting at all. What's she gonna do? Use her moped, dance, and throw pizza for her entire moveset?

* Sonic Series: This is where I will be killed. Knuckles, Metal Sonic, Eggman. Knuckles, in my opinion, should never be considered over Tails and Shadow. He's the tertiary member of the main group, sometimes swapped for Amy, and he'd be just another brawler but possibly with Sonic's spin dash or homing attack. So, basically just a slower Sonic. Metal Sonic would be a Sonic Echo, but probably having his own versions of the side and down specials that don't spin, and lacking the spring in his up special. That's just another Sonic. As for Eggman, having him in a mech means he'll be even more miserable on platform stages than Ridley, have the largest body hitboxes, and probably worse mobility than even Ganondorf. Outside the mech, he's still pretty tall, but can't fight as well. If anything, he'd probably just be a big, slow mix of Bowser Jr's specials and Mega Man's attacks.

* Castlevania Series: Alucard. Trust me, I think he would have been AMAZING for Smash, but... Given that we already had Link, Young Link, Ganondorf (kinda), Marth, Roy, Ike, Toon Link, Lucina, Robin (somewhat), Shulk, Corrin, Mii Swordfighter, and Chrom (debatably also Pit and Dark Pit) using swords prominently or exclusively, Alucard would have likely been treated horribly by fans not wanting to fight a fast glass cannon swordie with a very long and floating sword. I'd still love to see him added if we get the roster shrunk down someday though.

* Misc Series: Doom Slayer, Master Chief, Shovel Knight, Shantae, The Heavy. Doom Slayer could work, I've even made a moveset for him, but the problem lies in having to tone down the brutal feeling he has in combat to feel more cartoony and exaggerated. I fear this could water him down a bit too much. Master Chief also has a very doable moveset that, just like the former, can fit the E10+ rating with ease. Only problem is he's so tied to guns that, even using Covenant weapons, might make him feel rather off model. Otherwise, I feel like he'd work very well. Shovel Knight I just fear might either bring in a visually messy mechanic like in Rivals of Aether, or feel too much like another swordie, but able to also bury and/or command grab you easily. Shantae could be decent as a jack of all trades type of fighter, but my only real concern is if her outfit would push the rating up and how much her look would need to change. She wears far less than the Aegis and dances in a way that Western ratings might find provocative nowadays, especially in 3D. If they covered her up to work in E10+, I fear it might cause backlash or look really weird. Lastly, Team Fortress 2's Heavy. He couldn't bring in his iconic guns without pushing up the age rating for a fighting game that's already teetering on the edge in a number of cases (mainly since he uses mini guns that kill fast and use real bullets). Besides that, he's end up being just another slow, heavyweight brawler with terrible mobility.
    This is a really good answer. I think the Belmont's should have been skins of each other and give Alucard a spot on the roster. Maybe even Soma Cruz.
        I strongly agree on the Belmonts sharing a slot issue. The funny thing, that also irritates me, is both of them use Simon's moves, but the things they take from Richter are the design of the cross, angling the whip diagonally, the final smash, and the slide kicks (if I'm not mistaken with all that). Richter's only different so his holy water can be blue thanks to aura. If they were gonna both be on the roster as different fighters, I'd want to see Richter's skills be shown off in a more creative way with Simon being much more direct from the source material. Either that or have Maria involved with Richter's moves somehow. I don't know enough about Soma to have a comment tho x.x
    I will say doomslayer being more of a mature character doesn’t really track when both snake and *beyonetta* of all characters got in and plus the newer doom games did already add a cartoon aesthetic in some parts, but to each their own.
Fortnite guy, we already have Steve, just play Steve with items on, there’s your Fortnite character!

        The down voting is for your own good
            I deserved it.
Geno.
I'll be damned if we get more RPG rep rather than Paper Mario stuff.
    While I'm not opposed to Geno, I'd like to see Mallow get in. He looks a lot more interesting than Geno.

Fawful is better than a SMRPG character or Paper Mario in my eyes though.
    What if we got paper Mario first. Would you not care if geno got in then
        Yeah the more the better I was just stuck in a "only one" view but it's fine.
    geno felt incredibly out of place as a popular suggestion until the remake came along. i feel like there's four youtubers whose voices make thousands of people who have never even heard of smrpg scream for geno, mostly because he's the edgiest mario character around
    Paper Mario's reception would completely depend on what games he's made to represent. If they based his moveset off the first 2 games i think most people would be satisfied, but if he was based mainly off the new games most fans would probably be really disappointed.
        Yeah but obviously I meant 64 or TTYD or super, you make his moveset centered around his partners maybe a puppeteer archetype or like down B swaps partner which swaps his moveset or specials.
        I think Paper Mario fans would be hype for Paper Mario, no matter which games he's more based off of. It's still Paper Mario.

Besides, the moveset would most likely be based off all the games.
            I dont think you understand just how much some paper mario fans hate the modern games. To alot of fans anything after super or even ttyd isn't real paper mario.
FNAF characters
Sans. I'd much rather have had Frisk or Kris, both because I think they're better Undertale/Deltarune characters, but also because Sans feels like he'd have an annoying moveset
    He IS in tho,just,as a skin
Dante

I don’t need another Smash 4 Bayonetta
    Fr bro. As much of a big DMC fan bros moveset would be like bayo on steroids.
    I don't want Dante because he's a gateway for Vergil potentially being added to the roster next
        And as a MVC3 player, you are very valid for that. That motherfucker is TERRIFYING.
            Agreed
I'm seeing a lot of my answers already so I'll just toss in anyome from Overwatch. The community has become cringe and toxic and Overwatch isn't really iconic enough to gaming as a whole to justify it getting in anyway
Fortnite characters
Geno from Mario RPG.

There's a difference between adding in a retro character, vs adding in a irrelevant one.

As for the remake, that happened as a result of all these weirdos claiming for Geno, rather than the merits of the game itself.

If Smash wasn't a thing, people wouldn't mention it nearly as much.
    Also Waluigi, Sakurai knows better, he knows that Waluigi is some made-up character that never appeared in any canon Mario game, whose only* purpose was to be Wario's partner in Mario Tennis.

That's why he had the racket in Brawl, Sm4sh, and Ultimate, that's as far as his legacy extends.
        tbh, a cool idea would have waluigi be a complete representation of the mario spinoffs, mario kart being his side-b, mario tennis for his neutral, Mario party dice as a down-b
            And why him specifically? Other characters are present in those games as well.

I'll tell you why, because Waluigi has literally nothing else going for him, he's ASS.
                I mean, as far as I know, he's the only mario spinoff character that debuted from a spinoff title

Also, he would finally complete the mario, luigi, wario, waluigi set

Don't get me wrong, I don't side with the waluigi fans that harassed people for him, but I do think waluigi's inclusion deserves some merit
                    Fans claim that Waluigi could be a rep for spin-offs.

Yet, the Piranha Plant has appeared in WAY more of them.

Heck! The Piranha Plant even appeared as a major enemy in Sunshine, the* one game that didn't have traditional enemies such as Goombas and Koopa Troopas STILL has Piranha Plants!

Waluigi is literally bottom of the barrel kind of stuff!
                        Yeah, but pirahna plant was introduced in an actual Mario game and is iconic because they are a staple Mario enemy. Pirahna plant's inclusion represents their entire enemy archetype

but it doesn't specifically represent the mario spinoff party games, which waluigi is iconic for
                            Spin-Offs are usually determined by their environments, rules and items.

Those aspects have already* been implemented into the game.

The WarioWare stage basically works as Party Mini-Games, Mario Kart is already represented, multiple times, heck! Wario and Bowser Jr. Already have vehicles, and items are already a thing in the game, heck, Hero already implemented them into his moveset!

No Waluigi!
                                Honestly, valid, I appreciate your enthusiastic hate for Waluigi

No Waluigi!

                Justice for Toad
                    Hes doing just peachy
The Three House Lords (Edelgard, Dimitri and Claude)

I'd rather not have Fòdlan discourse in Smash

Honorable mention: Lyn and Hector
    I'm glad we got Byleth instead of any specific Lord. He's the main protagonist and wouldn't spawn any "which house is best" discourse.
        I remember my brother in law telling me his late Fiance once cosplayed as edelgard to convince him to pick black eagles
    I just wanna say I appreciate Byleth being Kylo Ren in your profile. Solid reference to that one Youtuber who called Byleth Kylo Ren during the reveal.
Jonesy, because Fortnite.
I'll okay to any character
Comment section made me realise 90% of smash fans are just idiots
Sora shouldn’t have made it in

I know he was the most requested character in the Smash Ballot, but I don’t want Bob Iger and Disney’s scummy hands anywhere on Smash

If Sora gets cut in a future game because Nintendo refused to pay Disney any royalties, then good riddance

Square Enix has more games with sword characters than just Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest and Kingdom Hearts, just choose Crono or 2B if you can’t get Sora in
    Hell, I’d take another Fire Emblem character over Sora
        Now let's not get crazy
    Agreed
    that wasn't the question asked .-.
        Had to get my hot take out

But in reality, I’m glad that anyone from Fortnite didn’t get in

But I have a feeling that we’ll get Jonesy next game

We just gotta wait for the “Fortnite is Cringe” train to die down the same way the “Minecraft is Cringe” train did before we got Steve in Smash
            I mean, Fortnite would be a massive IP, but i dont think you can put Jonesy in smash, his move set would be like the construction of minecraft + weapons and zoner like snake
If steve is hard to fight imagine a Steve with proyectiles? Nah, bro
                I wouldn't mind it if they made them super lightweight but not floaty, and made it so they need to build on something instead of just mid air. That way, sure, they can build a little base and shoot you from afar, but if you can get close they are easy to kill
The Rabbids
Crash Bandicoot. The crash games are great, but I can’t imagine a Crash moves being interesting at all.
    If you wanna play Crash just pick Orange Incineroar and spam neutral b

There you go you now have "Crash at home"
        Bro! I’ve been telling people crash should be an incin skin since release! Nice to get some validation
    No doubt.  I loved that they added banjo but he's kind of boring to play and you knew exactly what his kit would look like before it was even known.
any non video game character

This isn't r/SmashAU or Super Robot Wars
Any “person with gun” type of character like Fortnite guy, resident evil protags and even master chief tbh
Master Chief and Doom Guy

They were gonna be zoners no matter how it happened and I didn't want to deal with any more zoners, especially not zoners with dlc privilege. So I'm quite happy they didn't get added.
    Doom Guy could easily be made into an aggressive rush down character. In Doom you always want to be moving and playing aggressively so a passive zoner play style wouldn't fit for Doom Guy. They can limit the range of most of his guns by making them only have a hit box on the muzzle flash or turning weapons like the mini gun and blasta into Smash attacks.

But Chief on the other hand...
        >But Chief on the other hand...

You can do the same for him too.
        Nonsense lol, optimal doom play is skirting and kiting around enemies which is the opposite of aggressive. Also dunno why we are talking about the 1 game that sold like shit in japan as a possibility
            > doom play is skirting and kiting around enemies

In modern Doom you use a chainsaw the refill your ammo and one of the main powerups is just ***punch***. Doom games clearly want you to feel fast and powerful, not skirt around the action. If they based characters off "optimal gameplay" Mario would have a BLJ.
                u missed the point where while yes, u use the chainsaw to regain health *the moment you try that faceup with tougher opponents you will get your face chewed off.*

The whole gameflow is to run around and attack opponents from behind, then go for the weaker minions for health. doesn't sound so "manly", huh?

  
also i really don't get 2 shits mainly since there are twenty other reasons he's not getting in, so just saying "ehhh he's super aggro, good for smash, trust" is whatever at the end of the day
        The settlement isn’t even accurate doom doesn’t want you to get too close because demons have devastating attacks that can hurt the player nor do they want you to play far back because it will take too much time to kill demons. The mid range is where players live and breath
Also How would you make an aggressive rush down fighter with guns??????? Saying they can limit the range doesn’t change anything because unless his range is limited to being ridiculously close to his body than he would still be played as a zoner
            Modern Doom is all about movement and even in the classic Doom games Doom Guy is very fast.

>Saying they can limit the range doesn’t change anything because unless his range is limited to being ridiculously close to his body than he would still be played as a zoner

Look at Noel from BlazBlue
                * Modern Doom is all about movement and even in the classic Doom games Doom Guy is very fast.

And that changes if he will be a zoner or not?

* Look at Noel from BlazBlue

Most of her gun attacks don’t even shoot bullets just muzzle flashes bad example lol
                    Did you even read my original comment...?
                        Yes and I’m explaining to you no matter what you say “ he is fast, he is aggressive, he is this he is that”

There is almost  no way he ends up as a rush down character especially when  Most of his attacks would use guns!!!!

No seriously think about it what character in smash can play as a rush down character while simultaneously mostly using multiple ranged projectile attacks? Dude would at best be a mid range zoner. The archetype your envisioning is close to impossible and doesn’t even accurately represent the games
    They were better off as Mii costumes.
Waluigi. I was initially disappointed that he wasn’t announced, but the moment the fans started to actually harass Sakurai I decided that we kinda don’t deserve him anymore. I’m also glad that Sakurai didn’t cave to the harassers and add him.
Waluigi doesn’t deserve shit
    I wouldn’t be mad if they ever added him but I still 100% agree with you. He’s the most irrelevant Nintendo character and will forever be bound to the party games unless Nintendo somehow starts treating him seriously 20+ years after his creation, which is wishful thinking at best.
        i think most irrelevant mario character that can be considered part of the main cast, because i really haven’t seen many poison pokey fans as of late
            I personally want Shroobsworth.
        I definitely wouldn’t say he’s the MOST irrelevant Nintendo character, but he’s definitely the most irrelevant that people keep asking for. You don’t see people going “yo they should add Lot from fire emblem 6! He’d be a perfect fit!”, because he’s far less relevant than waluigi, and also from a game few people have played. Waluigi is at least in several games people played, from Mario karts to Mario sport games.
            I’d say his lack of relevance has more to do with how he has no bearing in the Mario universe even if the games _he happens to appear on_ are very popular. Even Fire Emblem characters are more relevant within their own niche, and the same can be said about Min Min for ARMS and Pyra/Mythra for Xenoblade. Waluigi was literally created _for_ the party games and that’s why he’s stayed there ever since. He has absolutely nothing going for him.
        Waluigi was literally created to fill a gap during Mario Tennis 64’s development. He’s really only in Mario games now because why not.
        For many many many fans (id be willing to bet for most people who own the game(s) actually), smash bros IS a party game though, and id still say hes more relevant than the freakin ice climbers
    Amen to that. 
    Thank you
Waluigi. I'm still convinced no one has any good reasons for why he should be in except for the memes.
    I've always been of the belief that the ones who actually view Waluigi as a meme are the people who don't like him and don't want him in Smash.

Yeah, I don't doubt there's a few Waluigi supporters that only want him for memes and bandwagoning, but how often do you actually see a Waluigi supporter say that they want him for the memes?

Meanwhile, *loads* of the people who are firmly *against* Waluigi constantly say something along the lines of him being a "dumb meme pick".
        What does Waluigi have going for him that other characters in from other games or even other Mario characters don't do better?
            He has popularity and iconicity on his side. He's one of the biggest requests for Smash at the moment, something that was noted by Nintendo themselves, which is certainly something he has going for him over most other characters. He's also not some obscure, irrelevant, one-off character like the Ice Climbers, Lucas, or fellow Mario request Geno. He's been in over 50 games (excluding things like ports) and been playable in nearly every single one of them means that he's honestly more-recognizable than a good chunk of the Smash roster. And he's not going to stop appearing either. Unless Nintendo pulls another Mario Kart 7, he'll show up in every single kart/party/sports spinoff that gets released. His appearances will keep growing in number, and he will never be irrelevant.

Another thing is moveset potential. It's no secret that the Mario spinoffs aren't exactly represented very well in Smash, despite being a big and important part of the overall Mario series. Because Waluigi is (unfortunately) exclusive to the Mario spinoffs, he could represent them in his moveset. Driving a kart to ram into foes? Using an Item Box from Mario Kart? Throwing a Dice Block from Mario Party? Using different sports equipment like tennis rackets, golf clubs, and baseball bats? You name it.

You don't even have to go with a spinoff-themed moveset for him to make him stand out from the rest of the cast. Waluigi's always been a really weird and random character with a plethora of recurring moves all throughout the series. Swimming in midair as if it was water? Spinning around like a cyclone? Summoning thorny vines from the ground to ensnare foes? Turning the baseball he's pitching absolutely gigantic? He can do all of that. He's also got an affinity for dancing, moreso than most other Mario characters, and you could incorporate that into his moveset to give him some stylish and flashy-looking moves. Heck, you could even give him a Smash-original move that fits his sneaky and whacky personality, like K. Rool's Gut Check or Incineroar's Alolan Whip.

What he's got going for him is immense popularity and iconicity, 20+ years of countless appearances that are only growing in number, and a moveset that could be very different from anyone we currently have in Smash, especially if the team gets real creative with him. Is that not enough to warrant a roster spot?
                Popularity is one thing but it should be the only thing that really justifies him.

Pretty much everything that Waluigi can do other characters can do already and his unique stuff isn't very unique. He doesn't have any that would create a unique gimmick like Rosalina has with Luma. Pretty much all of the spin off content is already represented with items, stages, and attacks, so there isn't really a need to create a new character to represent what is already in the game.

And even then are better Mario characters like Toad who is present in every spin of evening running them, has a significance to the mainline Mario games, a connection to power ups which is often what steps Mario spins off apart from the sports they are based on, and is more recognizable than Waluigi.

Waluigi really only has popularity backing him up, and that is it. There isn't really a demand for the "unique" that Waluigi would bring gameplay wise as a majority of it is already represented or could be represented by other characters who would bring more to the table. And there are just other popular characters who could be added to bring something unique to Smash instead of just another Mario character. Other Nintendo series could get their time to shine, popular third party characters could be added to appease a larger crowd, or there could even be a Persona situation where a smaller IP that isn't that big in the eyes of the general gaming community could get thrusted into the spotlight.
                    >And there are just other popular characters who could be added to bring something unique to Smash instead of just another Mario character. Other Nintendo series could get their time to shine, popular third party characters could be added to appease a larger crowd, or there could even be a Persona situation where a smaller IP that isn't that big in the eyes of the general gaming community could get thrusted into the spotlight.

I never really understood this sort of thing. Waluigi can't get into Smash because other characters and series wouldn't get their time to shine?

You can add both, you know. Waluigi could get in, as well as someone like a new Zelda character, or Bandana Dee for the Kirby fans, or Octoling for Splatoon fans. New series like Golden Sun, Astral Chain, Rhythm Heaven, etc. could get in too. And most popular 3rd-parties get added as DLC anyways, whereas Waluigi would absolutely be a base game pick, so I don't really see competition between the two.

Smash 4's base game had *two* Mario newcomers, three characters from Nintendo series already on the roster, *five* newcomers from new Nintendo series (six if you count the Miis), and two big 3rd-parties. Why don't they just do that again?
                        Development time and resources and it is limited meaning that not everyone can get into Smash so they have to pick and choose characters. The Mario series has the most representation out of every series and has all of the main characters present with maybe the exception of Toad does it really need more characters just for the sake of having more Mario representation? The devs have to choose which characters get in and which characters don't make the cut, and adding characters from series with smaller character representation or a completely new series would be way more interesting and impactful than adding Waluigi who really adds nothing other than his inclusion. At the end of the day Waluigi would just be another Mario character and not even someone who has anything to bring that is unique gameplay wise like a character such as Rosalina who has the Luma gimmick.

While Mario does have a lot of characters, 1, it's Mario, duh it's gonna have a lot of characters, 2, we're probably going to get at least a few unique Mario characters get cut next time, shrinking down the franchise's roster. Also yes, Toad really does need to be here, because holy sh\*t he should've been here since Melee.

&#x200B;

>and adding characters from series with smaller character representation or a completely new series would be way more interesting and impactful than adding Waluigi who really adds nothing other than his inclusion

Would a character as massively-requested as Waluigi not be impactful? The guy's one of the few 1st-party characters left that would generate the same level of hype and wish fulfillment as Ridley and King K. Rool, how would that not be impactful?

&#x200B;

>not even someone who has anything to bring that is unique gameplay wise like a character such as Rosalina who has the Luma gimmick.

Would a unique moveset not bring something new to the table? You say he wouldn't have Rosalina's Luma gimmick, but not every newcomer gets a gimmick to begin with. What was Ridley's gimmick? Simon's? Piranha Plant's? Byleth's? And yet they all still have unique movesets anyway. Also, who's to say they can't just make up an original gimmick for him? It's not like Marth's tipper was a feature in his home games or anything, or Lucario getting stronger the more it was hurt was a feature from Pokémon.
                He’s so iconic he’s never been in a mainline Mario game. Even Toadette’s been in a mainline game
                    The fact that he's still so popular and iconic despite never having been in a mainline game just shows that the spinoffs really are a huge and important part of the overall Mario series, and yet this fanbase acts like they don't even exist or don't deserve much recognition.
    Or maybe they just...really like Waluigi because they think he's a cool character?

I don't care much for Waluigi either, but saying people only want him for the memes really irks me.
        I always picked Waluigi in Nintendo party games, I want him in because all my other friends get their party game reps in the game lol
        Government psy-op, you aren't real, you aren't real, GET OUT OF MY HEAD
    It feels incomplete with Mario, Luigi, and Wario. Anybody who plays party games knows that Waluigi belongs..

Except you're right, Waluigi does not singly-represe t anything at all. It just feels weird.
        Smash isn't supposed to fill quotas
            Agreed, but still feels weird.
        Smash is for gaming Icons. Waluigi isn't the icon of anything except memes about waluigi not being in smash
            I mean by that logic we really don’t need 3 links… or Plant. I get your point overall tho
                Tbh we actually don't. The roster had many picks that were highly dependant on the speciohic moment the game came out or that were included for other serendipitous reasons.
                Toon Link is certainly iconic. Young Link, not so much. Plant is a clear middle finger to Waluigi, that's iconic enough.
                    Eh I wouldn’t necessarily say iconic… I feel like they could represent them all in 1 Link.
                        I’d say young link can go
                        I’d say young link can go
                    Plant has been in many more games that Waluigi. Goomba probably would have been a better "iconic" enemy rep imo but as far as significant representation in games I think plant outweighs Waluigi.
                        Goomba and Koopa far outweigh Plant. If it had anything to do with repping Mario enemies, they'd be first choice.
                            If that’s the case I wouldn’t mind a PT style called bowsers baddies or something with Goomba, Koopa, and either Boo or Bob-omb
                I agree lol. We don't need 3 links or a plant. 

Or a Waluigi
                    Yeah, or Doctor Mario. Or hell 7 very similar FE characters, I’d be fine with another fighter but they could give us an axe, spear, or polearm user that has a new style. Fun fact, I don’t think there’s a single fighter that ONLY uses a spear in all of SSBU
                        On fact there isn't and is the main reason why i am super angry at the FE roster. Like, i support Bandana Dee just because he use a spear, i din't even play kirby games anymore.
                        > 7 very similar FE characters

Why'd you have to go and undermine your solid point with dumb ignorance? Yes, there's Marth, Marth's Echo fighter, Marth's Clone, and Marth's Clone's Echo fighter, but that's only four, and pretending that any of the others are similar to them in any way that isn't "they come from Fire Emblem and have a sword" is ignorant at best. Sure, there isn't a lance user, and there absolutely should be, doesn't discredit the current FE reps at all
            Ah yes, my favorite gaming icons.

Sheik, Lucas, Ice Climbers, Roy, Piranha Plant, Dark Pit, and Pichu.
            >Smash is for gaming Icons

Honestly don't understand why people keep saying this it's just flat out wrong. There's so many characters in smash that are nowhere near "icons" yet people still treat smash like it's this exclusive club where only the best of the best can get in.
    I just like him, he's weird and makes me giggle :3
        It's a government pysop I'm telling you, none of you are real, GET OUT OF MY WALLS
            But it's cosy in here :\[
    Waluigi is a suuuper goofy and funny character, i like him. Yes hes only in the party games, but lets be honest, smash bros IS a party game. I see only good things about eeplace one of the obscure fire emblem people with waluigi. Id like a waluigi moveset that plays into the party games. Tennis, Golf, Kart Racing, Mario Party dice etc.
    I think he's the perfect rep for all the alternate Mario game franchises. He only appears in things like Mario Kart, Party, Golf, Tennis etc. and there's not really any specific representative for that despite Mario Kart being one of the most popular franchises of all time.
    Steve was added for the memes, why not waluigi? He's been in pretty much every sports game, use those
        Steve was added because he is the face of the largest, best selling game ever made lol wtf do you mean, he literally is THE icon of modern gaming. Minecraft alone has sold more than every Nintendo franchise except Pokemon and Super Mario. And that's one game vs entire franchises
        Do you really think Steve was added for the memes?
            Nintendo fans often live in strange bubbles where they clearly ignore the largest gaming world. See the fact that most of them still see Crash as a PS representetive.
Shovel knight. He makes sense as an assist trophy
    But that game is so good and has good content to pull a moveset from
But of a weird one but as someone who really wanted Lyn in Smash, I’m very glad she wasn’t added to 4/Ultimate. I think Brawl was her best chance at being added in, and 4 is when the Fire Emblem hate train really began so she’s spared from that. Plus, there’s always the PM mod.

Also 2B because after Pyra/Mythra I can’t trust Smash fans to be normal about female characters.
The myriad of indie characters with only one game and that were requested by zoomers...

None of them has ever come close to the same level as Undertale (*which got a costume and a track*), Shovel Knight (*which got a Trophy and spirits*) and/or Minecraft (*which got a fighter, a stage, spirits, music tracks and whatnot*).
    I think hollow knight should’ve had a chance. He had a perfect move set to rip from the game, and would work perfectly in smash. That along with the cult following of people waiting for silksong are enough imo
I would say Cinderace, I don't have any character I didn't want in. Never mind, Jonesy from Fortnite. I was glad Sephiroth was revealed, because I was relieved to know Jonesy was away from Ultimate.
Saying that shadow as an actual character would play similar to Sonic is a crime, shadow could literally do so much more
Waluigi
Waluigi

His fans annoy me when he’s not in the game imagine what happens when that 0 personality Mf’er gets added
Saying Shadow would play like Sonic is absolutely crazy
Waluigi. Loathsome and annoying "fanbase"
Waluigi. For the memes.
Someone I haven't seen mentioned anywhere yet: Hades from Kid Icarus.

Don't get me wrong, I love Hades in Uprising, but I feel like his sheer size is part of what makes him appealing. Also he appears in only one game which is always iffy, like sure he makes sense right now, but if the series does get revived (again) without him, then he'll be irrelevant.
Waluigi just because.
If anyone replies Waluigi i will strike them down
Waluigi, we don’t need him unless he appears in a mainline Mario game.
Gonna be one hell of a hot take but Crash Bandicoot. He has one of, if not the most insufferable fanbase out of any character request. Even to this day I see Crash fans being resentful towards the game as if they were entitled to have their precious marsupial in the game but he got his spot "robbed" by other characters. I'm not even joking when I say most of his fans are people who have genuinely never ever touched a Crash Bandicoot game, yet want him in just because he's a popular request. I say this because I used to be part of those people.

Also, people only want him because of nostalgia. That alone is imo not a good reason for a character to get in. Like I used to be obsessed with Angry Birds when I was little yet I have a shit ton of characters I'd rather see before Red.
Baby Mario
Fortnite
I'm glad we didn't get any more bayonetta characters bayo herself already ruined smash 4 with how painfully unfun she is to play against
Shadow because he's cringe
Rayman  
HEAR ME OUT  
Everyone wants him in the game, but then in fan movesets/mods, he's underwhelming.  
For example in the mod Ultimate S (no hate to the devs), he's just annoying and feels weird to play. Same thing with the fan-made waluigi mod.  
When thinking of characters you want in the game, you should think moveset potential instead of just your favorites.
Waluigi.
Master Chief, all those projectiles. DID YOU GUYS NOT LEARN FROM MEGA MAN.

        Thats false
Waluigi
Waluigi. He’s overrated and I don’t like him.
So glad they didn’t add any Fortnite characters and I will actually destroy my switch if they add one
Waluigi

The way waluigi fans harassed and insulted Sakurai for not putting their meme character in Ultimate made me glad we never got him in neither expansion packs
    That was only 2 people though and I'm pretty sure Sakurai didn't even mind.
Hot take: With how annoying Waluigi fans are, I'm glad he got the shaft.
    I swear to god, I hear more people complain about Waluigi fans being annoying than actually seeing Waluigi fans being annoying.

The most I've seen were those 2 guys who sent Sakurai death threats and that Intelligent-Bus guy, but that's only 3 people.

If anything, the hatedom for Waluigi is more annoying than his fanbase and this is coming from someone who doesn't care that much for Waluigi.
i disagree with everyone and will say crash bandicoot simply because he isnt interesting and fans want him for nostalgia
    Crash is not interesting?
    i hope you never get to eat a mango again. and have nightmares of ooga booga.
Bandana Dee: Seriously he would have the most boring moveset ever

Waluigi: People mostly want him for the memes, but in reality he doesn't have moveset potential. And if he does, that same moveset taken from different sport games could go for almost any othe Mario side character. Also, people really insist that he has more personality than Mario, and that's why he should get in the game. But shouting "Wah!" And his name like if he was a Pokémon, and the said "cheater" gimmick (where does that even come from?) ain't personality

Geno: An obscure side character that has appeared in only one game (sorry, a game and its remake). His moveset could be good, but appart of the 3 people that played Mario ROG, who would hype for his inclusion?

Any TF2 character: I just don't find the charm in them
    My answer was going to be Bandana Dee. Granted, I've never played Kirby, but he just looks so... Uninteresting
        And he is. But he's cute and Kirby fans are crazy for cuteness. He's literally like a Goomba but uses a spear. That's it, knows how to throw a spear
    >Geno: An obscure side character that has appeared in only one game (sorry, a game and its remake). His moveset could be good, but appart of the 3 people that played Mario ROG, who would hype for his inclusion?

IIRC, it started with a rumor about Sakurai wanting to add Geno in SSB Brawl, but truning it down due to Square-Enix owning the character.

I can summarize the hype as follow:

* Square-Enix came back with Cloud in Sm4sh.
* A Geno Mii costume was offered in Sm4sh as well.
* Square-Enix came back again for Ultimate.
* People hoped that they would offer SMRPG content, and we got 2 spirits.
* The Geno Mii costume hasn't been offered until Sephiroth was showcased.
* The costume didn't come with a music track, despite Yoko Shimomura being commissioned to rearrange a few new tracks in Ultimate. 
* It boiled down to Square-Enix offering the bare minimum in Ultimate instead of opening the floodgates  like SNK.
    I mean, if you restrict Waluigi to only using sports equipment, yeah ig he has a moveset you could give to anyone.

But he doesn't.

Because he has a bunch of unique abilities from those sports games.

So...

Yeah.
        But imagine him using those vines from *Mario Strikers Charged*, then using an "air swimming" ability, then whatever special move he has in another sports spin-off, it would make him look tike some sort of magic user, that deffinitely doesn't fit with the rest of Mario characters
            ...Okay?

Does he *need* to fit in with the other Mario characters? I'm sorry, I just don't see why him not """fitting in""" is a big deal?

In my opinion, I honestly think that fits him more, if anything. In the grand family that is the Mario franchise, Waluigi is like that one weird uncle that no one really talks to at family gatherings and crotch chops a lot. Being weird and out-of-place is what makes Waluigi... Waluigi.
    Kinda agree on Waluigi. To quote SMG4: saying “wah” is not a special move

However, I do not tolerate TF2 sacrilege. That has enormous potential for interesting move sets.
        I mean, I don't deny a TF2 character would have a good moveset. I personally just don't like the game
        To quote SMG4:

Waluigi Launcher
    I always find it weird how much people want Bandana Dee playable, while there are a ton of unique and interesting characters in the Kirby series.
        From my understanding, it's cuz he's basically the fourth main protagonist. He's been getting bigger and bigger roles in games, even being playable sometimes, so I take it as people wanting the quartet of Kirby, Dedede, Meta Knight and BDee playable in Smash.

Not to say he deserves a spot more than, say, Dark Matter, but that's how I see it.
            Personally, I've always wanted Magalor instead. People clamor for Modern Kirby representation, and Magalor is probably the most promoted post-Sakurai character, even getting his own side mode in the latest game. He'd likely have a much more interesting moveset than BWD, plus he'd be a mage character, which is an archetype in Smash that we don't really see a lot of
            Bandana Dee's basically the Luigi to Kirby's Mario, so I think he deserves to be in Smash cause of that.
    Pretty sure the SMRPG remake sold 3-4 million in the first 4 months since November.  


The "3 people played" this game is just patently false at this point.
    >Bandana Dee: Seriously he would have the most boring moveset ever

So you don't think sakurai and his team have enough skill to give him an interesting moveset? 

>Waluigi: People mostly want him for the memes, but in reality he doesn't have moveset potential

Once again implying sakurai and his team arent good enough to be able to make a moveset for waluigi. And no, there are people who genuinely just like waluigi. 

>but appart of the 3 people that played Mario ROG, who would hype for his inclusion?

The remake sold over 3 million copies in less than 2 months. More than enough people have played mario rpg and will continue to play it.
        Well using that logic almost every video game character could be in Smash because Sakurai and his team "have enough skill to give them an interesting moveset"
            I mean yeah. Unless it's like a tetris block or something the excuse that "they don't have enough moveset potential" is worthless.
            I mean yeah. Unless it's like a tetris block or something the excuse that "they don't have enough moveset potential" is worthless.
    >Obscure

I’m sure he is to anyone with their eyes closed during the Mario RPG hype cycle. He has a spot on the cover and everything.

>Side character 

This is flat out wrong. You play as Geno, he is a main character.

>Three people

Three *million* people, if the sales are to be believed.

>Who would be hyped?

Everyone who reacted to his inclusion as a Mii costume, as well as the three million people who played Mario RPG.
The only characters I'm happy to not see in smash are characters who are only added for the purpose of advertising a game and nothing more. I think it's extremely petty and childish to actively not want characters solely because you don't care about them but when a character is added for no reason other than to help nintendo make more money I don't see why the consumers should care.
As long your favorite character makes it in, It really shouldn’t matter if a character you hate makes it in.

But I’m indifferent towards characters like Goku
Waluigi pos
crash
Waluigi.

&#x200B;

It's fun to watch his fans suffer.
Waluigi.
People may hate me for this but Bandana Waddle dee. I've always had a bit of irrational hate for this suggestion, it just seems like such a waste of a slot imo. All the characters in gaming you can choose from and you want a waddle dee with a spear?
    They've got a freaking piranha plant in the roster, why not add an actual character even if his design is just a waddle dee with a bandana and spear.
Geno

I will not elaborate
Geno. He has had one game, and it’s long since past it’s prime. I wouldn’t know who he was if geno fanboys didn’t flood the forums requesting him
Geno.

I know I'm gonna get hate for this but Basically wanting someone who has "technically" been in only 3 games. One of which is a remake and in the other he was an Easter egg. I just don't see the potential in him.
Joker from Batman.

It'd be confusing to have two Jokers.
waluigi cause i think salty waluigi fans are funny
Geno

Because it would frankly be insane to include a side character that only appears in one game in such a massive franchise. Bonus crazy points for it being yet another Mario representative. Look, I get it, Mario is Nintendo's biggest IP, of course it's going to get a lot of representation. But I'm never going to ask for more of them, and never going to be happy when there is yet another one. imo the roster is at its best and most interesting when it's introducing me to franchises I don't recognize. That was why I loved CF, Marth/Roy, and Game & Watch back when I first played melee.
    *Main
Unfortunately, every character I've never wanted in Smash got into Smash
    Who were they?
        Steve, Sora, and they keep putting in ROB. Funny enough, 3 characters I've seen the community say they are some of the most hated to fight against, so I feel I'm not alone
Shooter characters like from Fortnite, Halo, Doom. We all know how draining it’d be to fight or spectate them, especially on wifi.
    Sick flair brother ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|give_upvote)
As a massive DMC fan, I'm so glad we didn't get Dante or Vergil. It would've been cool in concept, but they would've either had to nerf their movesets significantly, or they would've completely broken the balance of the game just like Bayonetta did in Smash 4, lol
Any irrelevant indie character, Waluugi and Geno
Geno. Paper Mario needs to be the RPG rep and has a way more unique move set.
Waluigi and I hope it stays that way. His fans are too obnoxious too
Shadow would have been awesome you guys just have no faith in Echo-Fighters.

Joker or Rob Neutral-B, Mewtwo Up-B, make him slower, make him hit harder, he'd be great!
Crash. Boring character and more boring idea.
Crash. He would be the most boring newcomer to be introduced to the franchise, solely based on how barebones his moveset is in his own games.
Geno
Dante. I feel like people don't realize just how absurd he would be. Bayo all over again.
Waluigi tbh, its enough with Mario, Luigi and Dr
    Bro forgor Wario sadge
        Oh yeah but my man Wario have a different move set and taking that into account, Waluigi could have a different moveset too, but think I just don't like that skinny tall memeistic m0fo xd
            Luigi has a different move set too where is your logic
            [deleted]
                Easy man I'm not that smart, I mean Mario Luigi and Doc are pretty similar but not the same, whatever, I don't like waluigi cuz it's just a rancid meme by now.
Tbh, I would have taken nearly anyone else over the entire second fighters pass sans Steve.
Paper Mario. By he he would be boring as a Mario RPG character. I would rather have Geno instead, he's so much more visually distinct.
Crash Bandicoot

1. Ugly design

2. Screw Activision

3. I've met way too many obnoxious Crash fans in various Smash communities, people who are literally the poster children for all of the worst "Scrimblo Bimblo" meme stereotypes. I want them to not be happy out of spite

Edit: also Tracer from Overwatch 

1. Screw Activision 

2. Imagine if Sonic had a projectile and could teleport
Idk because I never wanted Cloud, Sora, Pyra/Mythra or any other FE characters (outside of Lucina, Chrom) and Corrin. They aight) in the game. They fucking suck. Piece of shit anime weeb characters. WALUIGI SHOULD’VE BEEN IN IT GODDAMNIT. THERE IS NO GOD 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
2b form Nier: Never understood the appeal of this character. Like wtf is so cool about her?

A FNAF character: No. just no. wtf would the moveset even be?

Waluigi: the definition of beating a dead horse. Unlike the rest of these, Waluigi is the only one here who I wouldn’t mind getting in, but I kinda don’t want him.

Doom Guy: I dislike Doom, I personally think it’s disgusting and offensive.

Spyro: He would most likely have a bland moveset.

Shadow: He would most likely be a clone of Sonic, and that would not only be lame, but a waste of moveset potential. He has Chaos Powers.

Eggman: He would be a clone of Bowser Jr.
Spyro, crash, waluigi, waddle dee, Dixie kong, tails, knuckles, paper mario, geno, rayman,
geno, crash, spyro, and any scrimblo bimblo character tbh
I wish sora didn’t make it in
Shadow.  Because he's overhyped despite being completely cliché,  cringy,  and overall just a dull personality.  And mechanically,  he would be too similar to sonic.
    Bad take.

There is not a lot of antihero characters vs full of hope, smiling protagonists
        Yes, But Don't you think fang or tails would offer more variety  and uniqueness?
Geno, lul
Geno because fuck geno
Geno because fuck geno
Leon resident evil. A ton of top players want him in, but I don't really get why. I love it representation wise, but he'll be so boring to play and fight against. Waow he haves gun so cuul
[deleted]
    >but IIRC he mostly uses psychic attacks.

He doesn't
Shadow.  Because he's overhyped despite being completely cliché,  cringy,  and overall just a dull personality.  And mechanically,  he would be too similar to sonic.
Whichever character you wanted
Anything Touhou
    why? its probably the most deserving indie franchise to get in
People may hate me for this but Bandana Waddle dee. I've always had a bit of irrational hate for this suggestion, it just seems like such a waste of a slot imo. All the characters in gaming you can choose from and you want a waddle dee with a spear?
Huell Babineaux
Bubsy.
Shadows dont mean them getting in costed the spot of completely new character it means they dont have enough production time but want to add in a cool costume for a character
I’ve always wanted knuckles or waluigi. I’d be happy with either or. If they made it in!
Sora-... 

Damnit!

But Shadow would be great, he can be quite different to sonic tbh.
Cinderace because we already have Incineroar
I mean, Sora and Steve made it in, and they're both utter rubbish, so that's a tough question
Any fucking Fnaf characters. I hate that series with a passion
Hechachi it's just a me thing but I don't want any direct overlap with PSASBR.
Makoto Naegi. He’s the protagonist… but not a good pick for Smash. The most you can do is a slow punch and a Truth Bullet… so he’s a zoner. I don’t need to tell you how annoying it would be to have the only representation you get in your series be a zoner.

Monokuma is a way better pick, anyway. You have his attacks from UDG, all of his executions, and he’s more emblematic of the series than Makoto.
Paper Mario
Jonesey Fortnite
Not a fortnite fan.
Freddy Fazbear
WHAT IS YOUR MOVESET SUPPOSED TO EVEN BE???

Among Us
Funny but eh
Rex because he has a stupid annoying voice.
Honestly, even though I was kind of neutral on it back in the day, I’m glad an Overwatch rep wasn’t added after that tweet, in hindsight I really wouldn’t have been excited about any one of them
 I never want to see master chief or doom guy, it just wouldn't feel right for smash
James Bond he’s cool but I wouldn’t want to fight someone who only uses guns
Incineroar would have been horrible--oh fuck that's right.
Ngl I am pretty glad geno didn’t make it. Like let’s be real, if we’re talking about new Mario characters, there’s better options. If we’re talking new Mario rpg characters, there’s better options. If we’re talking more square characters, there’s DEFINITELY better options
Shadow the Hedgehog. Getting another edgy-recolor before getting Tails, Knux, or even Eggman would have really sucked.
Geno and no, I’m not kidding
Crash Bandicoot. I don't like Activision
Geno, he was honestly so overhyped I feel like there were so many better options
Geno because fuck the old people /lh
Geno. Waste of space in the actual roster
Geno 
(Refuses to elaborate further)
Rabbids, FNAF characters, Undertale characters.
Master Chief

Although I wanted him as well, looking back it was really just so far fetched
Geno. He was a side character in one game. Who cares?
Jonesy from Fortnite. The smash community is pretty toxic as is and I feel like if a fortnite character got added then the toxicity would only rise
Master Chief. He is a really iconic character from a saga that revolutionized the genre, yeah, but also he would be the shittiest, most boring zoner possible.
Garl
Anyone who's not from a video game.
Waluigi. Way too hyped for the luigi clone but taller that we would've ended up getting.
To make a long story short, my only roster wishes for this game once DLC was announced was that Steve didn't make it in and that Amasteru would. Didn't want Steve to make it in cause I knew as soon as he'd be added, he'd be busted and some 13 yr old would go win a major with him

My disappointment is immeasurable.
Any gacha game representative, I feel like we're due one in the next game but I didn't like any of the candidates that were being thrown around at the time of Ultimate's hype season:

* Euden from Dragalia Lost (a Nintendo owned gacha): Would've been nice to have the soundtrack in smash but Dragalia never made itself that well known and the game performed badly enough to get EoSd during dlc 2's run.

* Saber from Fate Grand Order (F/SN):  I love the fate series, I love Saber too. But I think they're closer to an anime franchise than a videogame franchise.

* Any Fire Emblem Heroes character: no, just no.

* Katarina from Granblue Fantasy (remember there used to be a rumor about her being included due to a partnership between Nintendo and cygames?): I'd be perfectly fine with a granblue character in smash, it's the oldest original IP gacha franchise I can think of. But Katarina is too 'normal' of a pick for a franchise that has hundreds of colorful and more interesting characters.
Tails

You have Kirby, Meta Knight, Pit, Dark Pit, Deedeedee and any other character with multiple floaty jumps.
We do not need another one that just straight up flies.
Nah he would wield that DAMM 4th chaos emerald
    That’s his down B
        YO! Shadow Down b being Chaos Control (like Meta Knight's cape) sounds awesome
            Isn't that more like Witch Time?
                Chaos Control can both warp and slow time. And I don't think anyone, even Sonic players, want Witch Time Sonic.
                    Ah well, he does do both as an Assist Trophy
                    *coughs and raises finger* Well.......some of us might :P
                    Your a Ridley main so shut up. U dont know what Sonic players want, while i know cause im one
            Dude I want shadow to have an Up B be a chaos control that spikes at the end of the hotbox like in his trailer on the alien lol
If he shoots you. HE KILLS YOU
For his neutral special, he wields a gun.

For his down special, he wields the golden gun
James Bond is a character that would've given Nintendo cold feet for licensing sooner or later. If they'd gotten anywhere with the character, even really late, he probably would've turned into Joanna from Perfect Dark.
    Barbara Broccoli and the Fleming estate are both NOTORIOUSLY picky about James Bond depictions outside of the books and movies. I feel like they would not like him being in a game where he can be thrown out of the ring by a monkey with a jet pack.
        IDK, I could totally see that scene being in one of the Moore films lol
            Well, yeah. Cubby Broccoli didn’t give a shit about bond’s image. I’m certain he would have been a-ok with Bond in Smash. The dude made Diamonds are Forever.
        “Barbara Broccoli”???
            Yes. She’s currently in charge of making James Bond films. The Bond films are actually a family business she inherited from her father, Albert Broccoli. Goldeneye was actually her debut film.
    i kinda would have liked to see joana dark make it in though. The 2 classic game genres that immediately come to mind as not having reps are FPS's and beat em ups (the latter being very surprising actually).
        Sadly FPS ain't that popular (if at all) in Japan
            For now, the only fps character represented in Smash is Mario. Just because he's a representative of EVERY genre.
                I don't remember Mario ever being in an FPS. Samus, on the other hand, has a few.
                    Yoshi's Safari.

And I did forget about Metroid Prime, my mistake.
I don’t think he was ever seriously considered for Melee. He did well in the “If there were a Smash 2” poll but that didn’t take licensing into account. Sakurai never pitched him in a design doc or anything like that.

The team likely knew it wasn’t going to happen. The sale of Rare to Microsoft already made tons of content iffy. Things like the rebranding of the motion-sensor bomb away from Perfect Dark and the lack of a Diddy Kong trophy are examples of this. HAL were unsure exactly what Nintendo would and would not have the rights to use after the sale.

I believe if we got a Rare character, priority would’ve been given to Banjo and Kazooie.
    Sakurai confirmed in an interview that Bond was at the bare minimum brought up during discussions, meaning he wasn’t out of the question, though you are right in that he probably didn’t progress much past that
        Well of course he'd get brought up, Goldeneye 64 is one of the iconic games of the N64.

The discussion could've just been something like *'hey here's why we aren't going to have James Bond as a playable character despite Goldeneye 64 being a super well known N64 game.'*
            The wording of the interview (I wish I could find the source but I was unable to) made it sound less like a “Here’s why he won’t be added” and more of a “We were considering adding him”

I feel like it’s kind of the inverse of the Snake in Melee situation where something happened that made it so it couldn’t happen for Melee and by the time Brawl rolled around they had their rules more set in stone
    >I believe if we got a Rare character, priority would’ve been given to Banjo and Kazooie.

Thank goodness that didn't happen
The final smash is shaken, not stirring his opponents.
Could you imagine the speculation nightmare Smash would be if James Bond got in
    A few characters that are highly likely to have gotten in if that happened are Spider-Man, Goku, TMNT, and a few others I’m sure I’m forgetting

Just… thank god that didn’t happen, as much as I’d love a character *like* James Bond, the actual James Bond isn’t it
    We still get people begging for Goku and Shrek and whoever else though, so it wouldn't be much difference though.
This is the answer
    All of the answers are *the* answers
        ![gif](giphy|uPnKU86sFa2fm)
Add him to the Base game for 6!
    damn he not getting in until the 720th game
What makes you think they would balance him like Steve and kazuya as opposed to literally all of the rest of the DLC? lol
    Not all the DLC are top tier but a lot have ‘gimmicks’ and comeback mechanics that people don’t really like. For example banjo and sora are ‘dlc balanced’ and while they’re not overpowered many people don’t really enjoy fighting those characters.
        I don't enjoy fighting sora because of his voice and it giving me PTSD from the countless hours I put into the first two KH games hahah
    You mean like Aegis, Joker, or Min Min, all of which have good arguments for being better than Kazuya?
        I don't think Minmin is top tier.  Joker and aegis are definitely up there.
            min min is the bayonetta of japan come on now
Yea I would agree
Pete from that Steamboat Willie game will show up to balance him out
At least Min Min has a more interesting personality
    You say that, but Spring Man's showed more personality in Min Min's own Smash reveal than Min Min has in her entire existence.

I like Min Min and all, but I genuinely cannot see how people say she has more personality than Spring Man, who honestly has more personality than most other ARMS characters.
        I was hoping for the black chick. Get some sexy chocolate in the game
            What a fucking weird thing to say
            I don't know, it's the same character that fights woth her hair... in a game named ARMS.
                It would be messed up if some other hair based fighter got in first before Dixie.

Edit: No wait, forgot about Bayo. Crap.
I never played ARMS, but I really like the look of DNA Man. He seemed so silly and amusing. I felt like an ARMS rep was inevitable for Ultimate, so I was hoping it would be him.
 i wanted an ARMS character since day one and then it ended up being horrible and on top of that we were so close to getting Ninjara
he would be fast and his main game play would be zoning.
    Yeah it would be sonic with charge shot lol
    I don't think he would be a zoner. His signature move is a projectile, and he is a soccer player, but he's also mainly a physically attacker in Pokémon, and would probably be more of a brawler in smash.
        A fire type starter Pokemon who's mainly a brawler you say? What a unique idea.
            This is the main reason I don't want Cinderace in Smash - we already have Incineroar, we don't need Incineroar but a rabbit with a football! And if the Smash team were considering making, for example, a faster, combo-based fire starter for instance, there are other fire starters that fit that bill considerably better than Cinderace, namely Blaziken and Infernape, and if they wanted a ranged fire starter, Delphox (or even Braixen if you want to cater to a certain subset of fans) would be a much better pick
        I see him being a better Greninja, maybe not as fast as ninja, but a good singular projectile to control space, and some good CQ moves, maybe a comeback mechanic, like a Z move (would say gigantamax but idk how that would translate to the game, probably more of a final smash.)
Agreed but that's because I consider it to be the worst Gen 8 starter
    Probably doesn't help he came from a lineup of Final Evos that are basically just furries.

I know it's already kinda iffy, considering the existence of others like Delphox and Incineroar among others, but Gen 8 was like the creme de la creme of final evos being furries.
        Rillaboom was just a gorilla though.

Yeah, gorillas are primates and therefore look somewhat humanoid, but he still looked like an actual gorilla and not a anthropomorphized one.
            Rillaboom loses a lot of points from not being part drum
                It's a kids' game first and foremost, they couldn't have shown him drumming on his cheeks.
                    It's a kid's game first and foremost, the main thing kids know about gorillas is that they beat their chest when fighting
        yeah but like… cinderace is cool.
That would’ve pissed a lot of people off
Cinderace would’ve been cool thoughhhhh
This. I hope this is the one rule Sakurai never breaks, no matter how popular the requests are.  Smash which was originally a celebration of Nintendo characters, has evolved to be a celebration of gaming as a whole. Comprising that rule to put in a character like Shrek who originated from a movie would be funny yes, but would also make smash lose some of it’s magic if now just anyone can be added.
    What about a character like Geralt of Rivia? Sure, he started as a book character, but The Witcher 3 is a pillar of the RPG genre and definitely what he's known best from, plus he's appeared in a number of crossovers with other games before.
        Although i dont want Geralt in ssb i still think he counts since he’s from a game. A fun twist would be to add the same Disney characters that Are in the final fantasy games. Its better than someone who only appeared on the movies or in a book. 

On the other hand i would so be up for a lotr smash
            The idea is that they originated from a video game so Geralt might be best known from a game, he is not created from gaming. It's almost like saying spiderman is from the comics but best known from the MCU so therefore he's a movie character.
                I would say that the major difference there is that when most people think of Spiderman, they think of the comics, movies, AND games, since all three are quite popular. Geralt on the other hand, despite originally being from a (excellent) book series and appearing in a (shitty) Netflix adaptation, is by all accounts considered first and foremost a video game character in popular culture.
                    Yah it's why I said "almost" about spiderman. He's not the best example but the main idea was that he did not originate from movies. Smash has a specific theme going and that theme simply was characters that originated from video games. All the non-nintendo characters originated from a video game even if they have a separate media presence like comics or anime. Smash went from a Nintendo only fighting game to a game that celebrated video gaming and it's history. Geralt's inclusion, regardless of his popularity, simply would have broken that theme.

Now the next Smash, if they wanna go all out on it, they can include whoever they want and be like a Smash version of Fortnight where everyone is included. Goku, Geralt and hell why not Hello Kitty
                        How is Geralt not part of a "celebration of gaming" though? He's a video game icon; Witcher 3 is one of the most celebrated and beloved games of the last decade, regardless of it being based on a book series. Geralt is most definitely not in the same category as the likes of Goku and Spiderman; no Dragon Ball or Spiderman game went many years being literally the most awarded game in history.
                            Dude you're not listening. He's not a video game character. He's a book character. Like Harry Potter is that also has video games that sold a shit ton. That's it. Nintendo aimed for characters that originated from video games. Geralt doesn't fit that ideal. If Nintendo wants to open the doors to book characters in the next smash, that's their choice but for Ultimate, characters that originated from video games. Geralt is a book character. End of story
                                By that logic neither is Master Chief; technically his first appearance was in the first Halo novel that released shortly before the first game in 2001. I don't think you'd find a single person on this Earth who would call Master Chief a book character.
                I think Dracula kinda enters that category but I guess people consider him an archetype now more than a character
I've had people on this sub tell me Goku is better known as a video game character
    Hell nah
    Isnt that the skin from fortnite??
Bro most people who want Goku don’t actually want him, the other half are brain dead delusional people. 

If you want Goku so bad, go play Smash Flash or Jump Ultimate Stars.
This. The moment they get in, no matter how many "It's just a one-off"s that are used. It would get to the point where NOBODY IS OFF-LIMITSI mean do you want to see Hentai protag #29858 join Smash? Or how about Slasher villain #51?

(not saying names, but you get my point. If LITERALLY ANYONE can become a fighter it would bump the rating up exponentially)
Sorry, they already broke that with sonic, snake, pit, and  probably some more I don't know of.




EDIT: also goku is in games. Hes in a shit ton of games, hell one is about to release.
    I wanna know what kind of logic you used to consider sonic, snake, and pit to be not from games
        Somic originated from comics, weeks before his game relase. The costume they use for snake originated from a comic, and pit is a character from stories (stretching)
            The sonic comics are there to promote the games, sonic is definitely a video game franchise first before anything
    Hey genius I have to go written it from a game and primarily play in games
        I'm assuming you mean they are primarily from games and that's why most know them? Honestly the same thing is for goku, the games are fairly popular and inteoduce tons to the story.
            If the franchise originated in a game they can be in Smash Bros anime, manga, movie, and book characters cannot be in Smash Bros unless the franchise they are from is gaming
Isn't Goku in the DBZ fighting games tho?
    Yes, but he isn’t from that game, he’s just in it. He’s from an anime/manga.
    But he was born from a manga, not from a videogame and the only rule to join smash is that a characters must be originated from a videogame (only exception is lucario)
        even then you could argue that lucario really is from pokemon and therefore "deserves" to be in

besides, it's a nintendo character. they are able to whatever tf they want with their characters
        Nah, Lucario is a video game character who had non-video game material release first, but mostly to promote the games he originated from, so he’s still a game character. Like Lightning McQueen appeared in the Cars game before he did for the Cars movie, but that doesn’t make him a video game character. 

I think the only real exception is Greninja, since the one in smash is canonically Ash-Greninja, and Ash is an anime character. Ash-Greninja does appear later in SuMo, but it’s only promotional material for the anime. An *almost* exception is Sephiroth, who Sakurai refers to as the Advent Children Sephiroth, with his design and mechanics being based off AC and his inclusion coming with tracks from the movie, which is pretty crazy.

There’s also other non-fighter exceptions, Goldeneye is referenced from 64-Brawl, with the motion sensor item being directly pulled from it in 64 and Melee. The assist trophy, Dr. Kawashima, is an actual real person. Mickey’s on Sora’s keychain.. and there’s probably some spirits ?
        wait how is lucario an exception lmao
            Because his first appearence was in a 2005 film
                Nope! He cameoed in PMD Red and Blue rescue team a few months before the film.
    They mean characters that didn’t originate from a game
    There's plenty of Dragon Ball games
        They have to be ORIGINALLY from a game not a game after its manga and anime.
And by that same logic, anime characters. Looking at you Goku
    I think Dragon Ball characters are one of the few exceptions because of the Budokai Tenkaichi series being such an iconic fighting game

The Dragon Ball franchise has had a handful of very strong video-game entries and has definitely left a decent mark in the industry. I'd go as far as to confidently say that the Xenoverse games are more iconic than the entirety of Bayonetta.

Yes, I believe Goku would fit right into Smash, and I want him in the game as a fighter.
Do Mario and Sonic technically count as movie characters? They have movies
    No. Mario and Sonic video game characters that have appeared in movies, not movie characters that have appeared in video games. You can flip your question on its head and ask if Superman and Goku count as video game characters because they appear in games.
    I’m talking about characters originating from movies and tv. Mario and Sonic do not
They would work as a funny assist trophy or a stage hazard tbh
    Rayman as playable and Rabbids as assist trophy would be neat
        Rayman as playable and rabbids as polygon mans would gorgeous.


Could you imagine ? 


Beating the crap out of them for hours ?
Yea f those guys
If we got Rabbids before Ray-Man? That would be a travesty
I’d rather have the Minions from Despicable Me
they only want Twintelle for her ass
    They want the thicc waifu
        Yes
    i can attest this is the main reason i wanted her in.
There is a character who uses a mechsuit, but the mechsuit has arms. Not sure if that counts.
    She was the second on ARMS characters who I didn't want in because she technically doesn't use her arms as she doesn't have ARMS, but it is less egregious that Twintelle's lack of using her arms.
[removed]
    [removed]
        EXACTLY.
        [removed]
    Did people actually say that?
        Yes they did

Tbf I do agree that Smash should have more black characters in it, but I'd rather not have an ARMS character with Witch Time.
            Well that's a wider problem with just a lack of black characters in gaming anyway.
            I don’t know why people were expecting her. She was the only one deconfirmed when it was announced that an ARMS character was coming.
        I saw some people who did, on Resetera specifically. Min Min was announced during the height of the protests against George Floyd's death, so people were hyper-aware about racial issues. Obviously there were a 100 issues with the train of thought. Twintelle doesn't use her arms and would have been an ill-fitting representation of ARMS as a result, Twintelle was mainly popular because of her ass, Min Min had good merits in her favor as the ARMS choice, Min Min was in development long before George Floyd died. And most importantly, an apolitical Japanese company is not going to change Smash Bros. DLC plans as a response to an American socio-political issue...
        they say that to not telt the thuth that they only want Twintelle for her ass
but the fact thar he was the only (i think) character to not return in the ‘everybody returns’ game was kinda sad. still missing rock smash 💔
    The three Pokemon have individual fighter numbers on [Nintendo's website](https://www.smashbros.com/en_US/fighter) (Charizard is #35), so I think he still counts as returning
    I think him returning as part of Pokemon trainer counts as him returning.
    Yeah that is fair, also nothing against him as a character in smash4, I'm just glad that if they were only gonna bring back either PT or Zard I'm glad it was PT
        with you on that one
    I feel like Solozard 100% could’ve coexisted with Red ngl
        That would be weird as shit
Thankfully the got rid of the stupid Stamina mechanic, so anyone who wants to still use him like a solo fighter can still do so.
but the fact that he was the only (i think) character to not return in the ‘everybody returns’ game was kinda sad. still missing rock smash 💔
bro imagine his final smash 💀💀💀
    bro would just kill children in a nintendo game 😭
I could see freddy as a mii brawler outfit
Thank you. Like wtf would the moveset even be
    Theres a rivals of aether moveset and a brawlfan1 moveset that answers that exact question
They would be sick as assist trophies tho
They would be sick as assist trophies tho
nuh uh
    Yuh uh, what’s the moveset? As far as I’m aware springtrap is just a dead guy who used to murder children while disguised in mascot costumes. It would be really hard to create APPROPRIATE moves from this concept.
        There is a pretty cool rivals of aether mod for springtrap, obviously not everything would fit, (namely Uair, Dair, and Bair) as well as visual changes to fit the 3d environment, but it could work. The main problem would be the potentially graphic material involving springtrap’s design. If any fnaf character made it in, it would likely be Freddy himself, rather than springtrap.
        pull from fnaf world, the movie (knife, paranormal abilities?), and phantoms as well as just technological things used in fnaf since william is an engineer and genius and bam moveset
Agreed. And fuck Scott Cawthon.
    What did Scott do
A Mii costume would’ve been pretty sick tho
Tell those people to go play Smash Flash or Jump Ultimate Stars
Wym? We got Ryu and Snake already. A lil late to the party 🗿
    Smash bad ryu and snake before it was cool
fortnite bad reddit chungus 100 u want ur gold already bro
    I don't care about the gameplay, fortnite is just everything I hate about corporate marketing in one game.
        I love it because it gives modders access to plenty of high quality 3d models, plenty of which have been made into smash mods.
        Yep. I know 'thing young people like = bad" is a common internet pattern, and I'm frequently guilty of it. But I see Fortnite as a soulless corporate attempt to replicate the community driven boom of Minecraft in the 2010's.
        boohoo you can play the game entirely for free but buy cool skins from other things you like so dystopian and capitalistic and terrible and scummy
            You can play the game for free until way down the road they inevitably pull the plug and since it's a live service game, that will just be the end. I despise the live service model that every modern game seems to have, especially since I have seen multiple games just become unplayable because of it. It also introduced battle passes to the gaming world which just spread like wildfire, so now every single modern game needs to have a battle pass with exclusive cosmetic items in it.
                >It also introduced battle passes to the gaming world which just spread like wildfire

Except it didn't. That was Dota 2.
                    I'm not a fan of Dota 2 either tbh. But I never saw the influx of battle passes in other games until fortnite released.
One of the most important and influential games in recent gaming history. Jonesy would be a great pick imo with tons of potential.
We all know Fortnite is just going to add a platform fighter mode anyhow. Epic cannot stay in their own lane.
    Not to be rude but who cares if epic branches out their game? Keeping the game new and exciting is good for them and the industry
        No, it is not exciting for the industry.

Fortnite has the brand power to make themselves the one stop shop for all of gaming. That isn't healthy for the industry. Thats monopolistic.

No one wants a future where the best survival adventure, fps, rhythm game, fighting game, rpg, etc is a single game. You know why? Because realistically it will not be as good as what came before. It will be too spread thin, lacking nuance, well tuned gameplay, and content.

That's not to say they'll naturally succeed if they try this. They failed to dethrone Among Us as THE social deduction game.

But no, I don't think it's healthy or exciting. I prefer a game be one thing, and for it to do that one thing really well.
That would be hella funny ngl
Jonesy would be terrible: imagine a mix between steve and snake, hell no!
Jones would be so fucking unbalanced anyways, imagine Steve with guns
    Imagine Jones building a whole suburb complex to block recoveries.
    At this point Fortnitw has had so many items throughout its history they could probably make an all-melee moveset for him.
    cant wait for him to be discovered as completely broken and have to be banned from tournaments after the game stops updating in smash 6
    *rubs hands together mischievously* (I unironically love fortnite and mc tho no joke)
Hard carried? Nah the game is just really fun, also I really find it ironic you say one game is carried by crossovers in a smash bros discussion
    Personally I don't find Fortnite fun. Also Smash crossovers are VERY different from Fortnite's. Fortnite has huge movie IPs and such while Smash is a celebration of gaming (at this point). Fortnite is a celebration of pop culture. I don't remember Smash having famous rappers, movie characters, streamers, anime characters, etc being in it. Point being, Fortnite has IP that is more recognizable to the general public. More people know about Thanos, the Xenomorph, Optimus Prime, John Wick, Batman, Joker, Superman, etc over characters like Pyra/Mythra, Joker, King K. Rool, Terry Bogard, etc. Most characters in Smash are only big in the world of gaming.
Jonsey would be funny af
fortnite is The Crossover Game nowadays tbh
That is actually a legit good reason to not want it represented, as opposed to all the people who just love to hate on it because it's so popular with zoomers.
he would be a zone with his Vietnam training and his tabletennis experience, and he would be fast af.
    Bro even at 999% he would be invunerable because he just want to keep runing a little
    Why not Walter White from Breaking Bad?
This comment section is like a box of chocolates. I never know what I’m going to get
Like he had any chance whatsoever.
    But what could possibly go wrong
        He has no pilot's license so his recovery would suck ass.
If one of them HAD to make it in and it was your choice, which one?
    Gotta be overwatch, fortnite basically has no IP
    is adding chun li an option for fortnite
        Yeah but she comes in a package deal with Goku
            no goku is preferred because he has godlike powers from what ive heard and anime
    Overwatch BY A MILE
        I think Tracer could be fun, but I'm not like begging for her to get in or anything.
I understand Fortnite but overwatch? Sau what you will about the current state of the game but the level of popularity that it reached in the game space was crazy. That franchise deserves to be in the next smash game
    yeah but tf2
I’d hate Tracer, but Jonsey would be funny af
    look i like my zoner character and we dont need more (unless its another mega man character)
Imagine Winton in smash another DK that would be so funny
DAT ASS THO

/j
This is a really good answer. I think the Belmont's should have been skins of each other and give Alucard a spot on the roster. Maybe even Soma Cruz.
    I strongly agree on the Belmonts sharing a slot issue. The funny thing, that also irritates me, is both of them use Simon's moves, but the things they take from Richter are the design of the cross, angling the whip diagonally, the final smash, and the slide kicks (if I'm not mistaken with all that). Richter's only different so his holy water can be blue thanks to aura. If they were gonna both be on the roster as different fighters, I'd want to see Richter's skills be shown off in a more creative way with Simon being much more direct from the source material. Either that or have Maria involved with Richter's moves somehow. I don't know enough about Soma to have a comment tho x.x
I will say doomslayer being more of a mature character doesn’t really track when both snake and *beyonetta* of all characters got in and plus the newer doom games did already add a cartoon aesthetic in some parts, but to each their own.

    The down voting is for your own good
        I deserved it.
While I'm not opposed to Geno, I'd like to see Mallow get in. He looks a lot more interesting than Geno.

Fawful is better than a SMRPG character or Paper Mario in my eyes though.
What if we got paper Mario first. Would you not care if geno got in then
    Yeah the more the better I was just stuck in a "only one" view but it's fine.
geno felt incredibly out of place as a popular suggestion until the remake came along. i feel like there's four youtubers whose voices make thousands of people who have never even heard of smrpg scream for geno, mostly because he's the edgiest mario character around
Paper Mario's reception would completely depend on what games he's made to represent. If they based his moveset off the first 2 games i think most people would be satisfied, but if he was based mainly off the new games most fans would probably be really disappointed.
    Yeah but obviously I meant 64 or TTYD or super, you make his moveset centered around his partners maybe a puppeteer archetype or like down B swaps partner which swaps his moveset or specials.
    I think Paper Mario fans would be hype for Paper Mario, no matter which games he's more based off of. It's still Paper Mario.

Besides, the moveset would most likely be based off all the games.
        I dont think you understand just how much some paper mario fans hate the modern games. To alot of fans anything after super or even ttyd isn't real paper mario.
He IS in tho,just,as a skin
Fr bro. As much of a big DMC fan bros moveset would be like bayo on steroids.
I don't want Dante because he's a gateway for Vergil potentially being added to the roster next
    And as a MVC3 player, you are very valid for that. That motherfucker is TERRIFYING.
        Agreed
Also Waluigi, Sakurai knows better, he knows that Waluigi is some made-up character that never appeared in any canon Mario game, whose only* purpose was to be Wario's partner in Mario Tennis.

That's why he had the racket in Brawl, Sm4sh, and Ultimate, that's as far as his legacy extends.
    tbh, a cool idea would have waluigi be a complete representation of the mario spinoffs, mario kart being his side-b, mario tennis for his neutral, Mario party dice as a down-b
        And why him specifically? Other characters are present in those games as well.

I'll tell you why, because Waluigi has literally nothing else going for him, he's ASS.
            I mean, as far as I know, he's the only mario spinoff character that debuted from a spinoff title

Also, he would finally complete the mario, luigi, wario, waluigi set

Don't get me wrong, I don't side with the waluigi fans that harassed people for him, but I do think waluigi's inclusion deserves some merit
                Fans claim that Waluigi could be a rep for spin-offs.

Yet, the Piranha Plant has appeared in WAY more of them.

Heck! The Piranha Plant even appeared as a major enemy in Sunshine, the* one game that didn't have traditional enemies such as Goombas and Koopa Troopas STILL has Piranha Plants!

Waluigi is literally bottom of the barrel kind of stuff!
                    Yeah, but pirahna plant was introduced in an actual Mario game and is iconic because they are a staple Mario enemy. Pirahna plant's inclusion represents their entire enemy archetype

but it doesn't specifically represent the mario spinoff party games, which waluigi is iconic for
                        Spin-Offs are usually determined by their environments, rules and items.

Those aspects have already* been implemented into the game.

The WarioWare stage basically works as Party Mini-Games, Mario Kart is already represented, multiple times, heck! Wario and Bowser Jr. Already have vehicles, and items are already a thing in the game, heck, Hero already implemented them into his moveset!

No Waluigi!
                            Honestly, valid, I appreciate your enthusiastic hate for Waluigi

No Waluigi!

            Justice for Toad
                Hes doing just peachy
I'm glad we got Byleth instead of any specific Lord. He's the main protagonist and wouldn't spawn any "which house is best" discourse.
    I remember my brother in law telling me his late Fiance once cosplayed as edelgard to convince him to pick black eagles
I just wanna say I appreciate Byleth being Kylo Ren in your profile. Solid reference to that one Youtuber who called Byleth Kylo Ren during the reveal.
Hell, I’d take another Fire Emblem character over Sora
    Now let's not get crazy
Agreed
that wasn't the question asked .-.
    Had to get my hot take out

But in reality, I’m glad that anyone from Fortnite didn’t get in

But I have a feeling that we’ll get Jonesy next game

We just gotta wait for the “Fortnite is Cringe” train to die down the same way the “Minecraft is Cringe” train did before we got Steve in Smash
        I mean, Fortnite would be a massive IP, but i dont think you can put Jonesy in smash, his move set would be like the construction of minecraft + weapons and zoner like snake
If steve is hard to fight imagine a Steve with proyectiles? Nah, bro
            I wouldn't mind it if they made them super lightweight but not floaty, and made it so they need to build on something instead of just mid air. That way, sure, they can build a little base and shoot you from afar, but if you can get close they are easy to kill
If you wanna play Crash just pick Orange Incineroar and spam neutral b

There you go you now have "Crash at home"
    Bro! I’ve been telling people crash should be an incin skin since release! Nice to get some validation
No doubt.  I loved that they added banjo but he's kind of boring to play and you knew exactly what his kit would look like before it was even known.
Doom Guy could easily be made into an aggressive rush down character. In Doom you always want to be moving and playing aggressively so a passive zoner play style wouldn't fit for Doom Guy. They can limit the range of most of his guns by making them only have a hit box on the muzzle flash or turning weapons like the mini gun and blasta into Smash attacks.

But Chief on the other hand...
    >But Chief on the other hand...

You can do the same for him too.
    Nonsense lol, optimal doom play is skirting and kiting around enemies which is the opposite of aggressive. Also dunno why we are talking about the 1 game that sold like shit in japan as a possibility
        > doom play is skirting and kiting around enemies

In modern Doom you use a chainsaw the refill your ammo and one of the main powerups is just ***punch***. Doom games clearly want you to feel fast and powerful, not skirt around the action. If they based characters off "optimal gameplay" Mario would have a BLJ.
            u missed the point where while yes, u use the chainsaw to regain health *the moment you try that faceup with tougher opponents you will get your face chewed off.*

The whole gameflow is to run around and attack opponents from behind, then go for the weaker minions for health. doesn't sound so "manly", huh?

  
also i really don't get 2 shits mainly since there are twenty other reasons he's not getting in, so just saying "ehhh he's super aggro, good for smash, trust" is whatever at the end of the day
    The settlement isn’t even accurate doom doesn’t want you to get too close because demons have devastating attacks that can hurt the player nor do they want you to play far back because it will take too much time to kill demons. The mid range is where players live and breath
Also How would you make an aggressive rush down fighter with guns??????? Saying they can limit the range doesn’t change anything because unless his range is limited to being ridiculously close to his body than he would still be played as a zoner
        Modern Doom is all about movement and even in the classic Doom games Doom Guy is very fast.

>Saying they can limit the range doesn’t change anything because unless his range is limited to being ridiculously close to his body than he would still be played as a zoner

Look at Noel from BlazBlue
            * Modern Doom is all about movement and even in the classic Doom games Doom Guy is very fast.

And that changes if he will be a zoner or not?

* Look at Noel from BlazBlue

Most of her gun attacks don’t even shoot bullets just muzzle flashes bad example lol
                Did you even read my original comment...?
                    Yes and I’m explaining to you no matter what you say “ he is fast, he is aggressive, he is this he is that”

There is almost  no way he ends up as a rush down character especially when  Most of his attacks would use guns!!!!

No seriously think about it what character in smash can play as a rush down character while simultaneously mostly using multiple ranged projectile attacks? Dude would at best be a mid range zoner. The archetype your envisioning is close to impossible and doesn’t even accurately represent the games
They were better off as Mii costumes.
I wouldn’t be mad if they ever added him but I still 100% agree with you. He’s the most irrelevant Nintendo character and will forever be bound to the party games unless Nintendo somehow starts treating him seriously 20+ years after his creation, which is wishful thinking at best.
    i think most irrelevant mario character that can be considered part of the main cast, because i really haven’t seen many poison pokey fans as of late
        I personally want Shroobsworth.
    I definitely wouldn’t say he’s the MOST irrelevant Nintendo character, but he’s definitely the most irrelevant that people keep asking for. You don’t see people going “yo they should add Lot from fire emblem 6! He’d be a perfect fit!”, because he’s far less relevant than waluigi, and also from a game few people have played. Waluigi is at least in several games people played, from Mario karts to Mario sport games.
        I’d say his lack of relevance has more to do with how he has no bearing in the Mario universe even if the games _he happens to appear on_ are very popular. Even Fire Emblem characters are more relevant within their own niche, and the same can be said about Min Min for ARMS and Pyra/Mythra for Xenoblade. Waluigi was literally created _for_ the party games and that’s why he’s stayed there ever since. He has absolutely nothing going for him.
    Waluigi was literally created to fill a gap during Mario Tennis 64’s development. He’s really only in Mario games now because why not.
    For many many many fans (id be willing to bet for most people who own the game(s) actually), smash bros IS a party game though, and id still say hes more relevant than the freakin ice climbers
Amen to that. 
Thank you
I've always been of the belief that the ones who actually view Waluigi as a meme are the people who don't like him and don't want him in Smash.

Yeah, I don't doubt there's a few Waluigi supporters that only want him for memes and bandwagoning, but how often do you actually see a Waluigi supporter say that they want him for the memes?

Meanwhile, *loads* of the people who are firmly *against* Waluigi constantly say something along the lines of him being a "dumb meme pick".
    What does Waluigi have going for him that other characters in from other games or even other Mario characters don't do better?
        He has popularity and iconicity on his side. He's one of the biggest requests for Smash at the moment, something that was noted by Nintendo themselves, which is certainly something he has going for him over most other characters. He's also not some obscure, irrelevant, one-off character like the Ice Climbers, Lucas, or fellow Mario request Geno. He's been in over 50 games (excluding things like ports) and been playable in nearly every single one of them means that he's honestly more-recognizable than a good chunk of the Smash roster. And he's not going to stop appearing either. Unless Nintendo pulls another Mario Kart 7, he'll show up in every single kart/party/sports spinoff that gets released. His appearances will keep growing in number, and he will never be irrelevant.

Another thing is moveset potential. It's no secret that the Mario spinoffs aren't exactly represented very well in Smash, despite being a big and important part of the overall Mario series. Because Waluigi is (unfortunately) exclusive to the Mario spinoffs, he could represent them in his moveset. Driving a kart to ram into foes? Using an Item Box from Mario Kart? Throwing a Dice Block from Mario Party? Using different sports equipment like tennis rackets, golf clubs, and baseball bats? You name it.

You don't even have to go with a spinoff-themed moveset for him to make him stand out from the rest of the cast. Waluigi's always been a really weird and random character with a plethora of recurring moves all throughout the series. Swimming in midair as if it was water? Spinning around like a cyclone? Summoning thorny vines from the ground to ensnare foes? Turning the baseball he's pitching absolutely gigantic? He can do all of that. He's also got an affinity for dancing, moreso than most other Mario characters, and you could incorporate that into his moveset to give him some stylish and flashy-looking moves. Heck, you could even give him a Smash-original move that fits his sneaky and whacky personality, like K. Rool's Gut Check or Incineroar's Alolan Whip.

What he's got going for him is immense popularity and iconicity, 20+ years of countless appearances that are only growing in number, and a moveset that could be very different from anyone we currently have in Smash, especially if the team gets real creative with him. Is that not enough to warrant a roster spot?
            Popularity is one thing but it should be the only thing that really justifies him.

Pretty much everything that Waluigi can do other characters can do already and his unique stuff isn't very unique. He doesn't have any that would create a unique gimmick like Rosalina has with Luma. Pretty much all of the spin off content is already represented with items, stages, and attacks, so there isn't really a need to create a new character to represent what is already in the game.

And even then are better Mario characters like Toad who is present in every spin of evening running them, has a significance to the mainline Mario games, a connection to power ups which is often what steps Mario spins off apart from the sports they are based on, and is more recognizable than Waluigi.

Waluigi really only has popularity backing him up, and that is it. There isn't really a demand for the "unique" that Waluigi would bring gameplay wise as a majority of it is already represented or could be represented by other characters who would bring more to the table. And there are just other popular characters who could be added to bring something unique to Smash instead of just another Mario character. Other Nintendo series could get their time to shine, popular third party characters could be added to appease a larger crowd, or there could even be a Persona situation where a smaller IP that isn't that big in the eyes of the general gaming community could get thrusted into the spotlight.
                >And there are just other popular characters who could be added to bring something unique to Smash instead of just another Mario character.

I never really understood this sort of thing. Waluigi can't get into Smash because other characters and series wouldn't get their time to shine?

You can add both, you know. Waluigi could get in, as well as someone like a new Zelda character, or Bandana Dee for the Kirby fans, or Octoling for Splatoon fans. New series like Golden Sun, Astral Chain, Rhythm Heaven, etc. could get in too. And most popular 3rd-parties get added as DLC anyways, whereas Waluigi would absolutely be a base game pick, so I don't really see competition between the two.

Smash 4's base game had *two* Mario newcomers, three characters from Nintendo series already on the roster, *five* newcomers from new Nintendo series (six if you count the Miis), and two big 3rd-parties. Why don't they just do that again?
                    Development time and resources and it is limited meaning that not everyone can get into Smash so they have to pick and choose characters. The Mario series has the most representation out of every series and has all of the main characters present with maybe the exception of Toad does it really need more characters just for the sake of having more Mario representation? The devs have to choose which characters get in and which characters don't make the cut, and adding characters from series with smaller character representation or a completely new series would be way more interesting and impactful than adding Waluigi who really adds nothing other than his inclusion. At the end of the day Waluigi would just be another Mario character and not even someone who has anything to bring that is unique gameplay wise like a character such as Rosalina who has the Luma gimmick.
                        >The Mario series has the most representation out of every series and has all of the main characters present with maybe the exception of Toad does it really need more characters just for the sake of having more Mario representation?

While Mario does have a lot of characters, 1, it's Mario, duh it's gonna have a lot of characters, 2, we're probably going to get at least a few unique Mario characters get cut next time, shrinking down the franchise's roster. Also yes, Toad really does need to be here, because holy sh\*t he should've been here since Melee.

&#x200B;

>and adding characters from series with smaller character representation or a completely new series would be way more interesting and impactful than adding Waluigi who really adds nothing other than his inclusion

Would a character as massively-requested as Waluigi not be impactful? The guy's one of the few 1st-party characters left that would generate the same level of hype and wish fulfillment as Ridley and King K. Rool, how would that not be impactful?

&#x200B;

>not even someone who has anything to bring that is unique gameplay wise like a character such as Rosalina who has the Luma gimmick.

Would a unique moveset not bring something new to the table? You say he wouldn't have Rosalina's Luma gimmick, but not every newcomer gets a gimmick to begin with. What was Ridley's gimmick? Simon's? Piranha Plant's? Byleth's? And yet they all still have unique movesets anyway. Also, who's to say they can't just make up an original gimmick for him? It's not like Marth's tipper was a feature in his home games or anything, or Lucario getting stronger the more it was hurt was a feature from Pokémon.
            He’s so iconic he’s never been in a mainline Mario game. Even Toadette’s been in a mainline game
                The fact that he's still so popular and iconic despite never having been in a mainline game just shows that the spinoffs really are a huge and important part of the overall Mario series, and yet this fanbase acts like they don't even exist or don't deserve much recognition.
Or maybe they just...really like Waluigi because they think he's a cool character?

I don't care much for Waluigi either, but saying people only want him for the memes really irks me.
    I always picked Waluigi in Nintendo party games, I want him in because all my other friends get their party game reps in the game lol
    Government psy-op, you aren't real, you aren't real, GET OUT OF MY HEAD
It feels incomplete with Mario, Luigi, and Wario. Anybody who plays party games knows that Waluigi belongs..

Except you're right, Waluigi does not singly-represe t anything at all. It just feels weird.
    Smash isn't supposed to fill quotas
        Agreed, but still feels weird.
    Smash is for gaming Icons. Waluigi isn't the icon of anything except memes about waluigi not being in smash
        I mean by that logic we really don’t need 3 links… or Plant. I get your point overall tho
            Tbh we actually don't. The roster had many picks that were highly dependant on the speciohic moment the game came out or that were included for other serendipitous reasons.
            Toon Link is certainly iconic. Young Link, not so much. Plant is a clear middle finger to Waluigi, that's iconic enough.
                Eh I wouldn’t necessarily say iconic… I feel like they could represent them all in 1 Link.
                    I’d say young link can go
                    I’d say young link can go
                Plant has been in many more games that Waluigi. Goomba probably would have been a better "iconic" enemy rep imo but as far as significant representation in games I think plant outweighs Waluigi.
                    Goomba and Koopa far outweigh Plant. If it had anything to do with repping Mario enemies, they'd be first choice.
                        If that’s the case I wouldn’t mind a PT style called bowsers baddies or something with Goomba, Koopa, and either Boo or Bob-omb
            I agree lol. We don't need 3 links or a plant. 

Or a Waluigi
                Yeah, or Doctor Mario. Or hell 7 very similar FE characters, I’d be fine with another fighter but they could give us an axe, spear, or polearm user that has a new style. Fun fact, I don’t think there’s a single fighter that ONLY uses a spear in all of SSBU
                    On fact there isn't and is the main reason why i am super angry at the FE roster. Like, i support Bandana Dee just because he use a spear, i din't even play kirby games anymore.
                    > 7 very similar FE characters

Why'd you have to go and undermine your solid point with dumb ignorance? Yes, there's Marth, Marth's Echo fighter, Marth's Clone, and Marth's Clone's Echo fighter, but that's only four, and pretending that any of the others are similar to them in any way that isn't "they come from Fire Emblem and have a sword" is ignorant at best. Sure, there isn't a lance user, and there absolutely should be, doesn't discredit the current FE reps at all
        Ah yes, my favorite gaming icons.

Sheik, Lucas, Ice Climbers, Roy, Piranha Plant, Dark Pit, and Pichu.
        >Smash is for gaming Icons

Honestly don't understand why people keep saying this it's just flat out wrong. There's so many characters in smash that are nowhere near "icons" yet people still treat smash like it's this exclusive club where only the best of the best can get in.
I just like him, he's weird and makes me giggle :3
    It's a government pysop I'm telling you, none of you are real, GET OUT OF MY WALLS
        But it's cosy in here :\[
Waluigi is a suuuper goofy and funny character, i like him. Yes hes only in the party games, but lets be honest, smash bros IS a party game. I see only good things about eeplace one of the obscure fire emblem people with waluigi. Id like a waluigi moveset that plays into the party games. Tennis, Golf, Kart Racing, Mario Party dice etc.
I think he's the perfect rep for all the alternate Mario game franchises. He only appears in things like Mario Kart, Party, Golf, Tennis etc. and there's not really any specific representative for that despite Mario Kart being one of the most popular franchises of all time.
Steve was added for the memes, why not waluigi? He's been in pretty much every sports game, use those
    Steve was added because he is the face of the largest, best selling game ever made lol wtf do you mean, he literally is THE icon of modern gaming. Minecraft alone has sold more than every Nintendo franchise except Pokemon and Super Mario. And that's one game vs entire franchises
    Do you really think Steve was added for the memes?
        Nintendo fans often live in strange bubbles where they clearly ignore the largest gaming world. See the fact that most of them still see Crash as a PS representetive.
But that game is so good and has good content to pull a moveset from
I think hollow knight should’ve had a chance. He had a perfect move set to rip from the game, and would work perfectly in smash. That along with the cult following of people waiting for silksong are enough imo
2018 was 7 years ago
    Thats false
That was only 2 people though and I'm pretty sure Sakurai didn't even mind.
I swear to god, I hear more people complain about Waluigi fans being annoying than actually seeing Waluigi fans being annoying.

The most I've seen were those 2 guys who sent Sakurai death threats and that Intelligent-Bus guy, but that's only 3 people.

If anything, the hatedom for Waluigi is more annoying than his fanbase and this is coming from someone who doesn't care that much for Waluigi.
Crash is not interesting?
i hope you never get to eat a mango again. and have nightmares of ooga booga.
My answer was going to be Bandana Dee. Granted, I've never played Kirby, but he just looks so... Uninteresting
    And he is. But he's cute and Kirby fans are crazy for cuteness. He's literally like a Goomba but uses a spear. That's it, knows how to throw a spear
>Geno: An obscure side character that has appeared in only one game (sorry, a game and its remake). His moveset could be good, but appart of the 3 people that played Mario ROG, who would hype for his inclusion?

IIRC, it started with a rumor about Sakurai wanting to add Geno in SSB Brawl, but truning it down due to Square-Enix owning the character.

I can summarize the hype as follow:

* Square-Enix came back with Cloud in Sm4sh.
* A Geno Mii costume was offered in Sm4sh as well.
* Square-Enix came back again for Ultimate.
* People hoped that they would offer SMRPG content, and we got 2 spirits.
* The Geno Mii costume hasn't been offered until Sephiroth was showcased.
* The costume didn't come with a music track, despite Yoko Shimomura being commissioned to rearrange a few new tracks in Ultimate. 
* It boiled down to Square-Enix offering the bare minimum in Ultimate instead of opening the floodgates  like SNK.
I mean, if you restrict Waluigi to only using sports equipment, yeah ig he has a moveset you could give to anyone.

But he doesn't.

Because he has a bunch of unique abilities from those sports games.

So...

Yeah.
    But imagine him using those vines from *Mario Strikers Charged*, then using an "air swimming" ability, then whatever special move he has in another sports spin-off, it would make him look tike some sort of magic user, that deffinitely doesn't fit with the rest of Mario characters
        ...Okay?

Does he *need* to fit in with the other Mario characters? I'm sorry, I just don't see why him not """fitting in""" is a big deal?

In my opinion, I honestly think that fits him more, if anything. In the grand family that is the Mario franchise, Waluigi is like that one weird uncle that no one really talks to at family gatherings and crotch chops a lot. Being weird and out-of-place is what makes Waluigi... Waluigi.
Kinda agree on Waluigi. To quote SMG4: saying “wah” is not a special move

However, I do not tolerate TF2 sacrilege. That has enormous potential for interesting move sets.
    I mean, I don't deny a TF2 character would have a good moveset. I personally just don't like the game
    To quote SMG4:

Waluigi Launcher
I always find it weird how much people want Bandana Dee playable, while there are a ton of unique and interesting characters in the Kirby series.
    From my understanding, it's cuz he's basically the fourth main protagonist. He's been getting bigger and bigger roles in games, even being playable sometimes, so I take it as people wanting the quartet of Kirby, Dedede, Meta Knight and BDee playable in Smash.

Not to say he deserves a spot more than, say, Dark Matter, but that's how I see it.
        Personally, I've always wanted Magalor instead. People clamor for Modern Kirby representation, and Magalor is probably the most promoted post-Sakurai character, even getting his own side mode in the latest game. He'd likely have a much more interesting moveset than BWD, plus he'd be a mage character, which is an archetype in Smash that we don't really see a lot of
        Bandana Dee's basically the Luigi to Kirby's Mario, so I think he deserves to be in Smash cause of that.
Pretty sure the SMRPG remake sold 3-4 million in the first 4 months since November.  


The "3 people played" this game is just patently false at this point.
>Bandana Dee: Seriously he would have the most boring moveset ever

So you don't think sakurai and his team have enough skill to give him an interesting moveset? 

>Waluigi: People mostly want him for the memes, but in reality he doesn't have moveset potential

Once again implying sakurai and his team arent good enough to be able to make a moveset for waluigi. And no, there are people who genuinely just like waluigi. 

>but appart of the 3 people that played Mario ROG, who would hype for his inclusion?

The remake sold over 3 million copies in less than 2 months. More than enough people have played mario rpg and will continue to play it.
    Well using that logic almost every video game character could be in Smash because Sakurai and his team "have enough skill to give them an interesting moveset"
        I mean yeah. Unless it's like a tetris block or something the excuse that "they don't have enough moveset potential" is worthless.
        I mean yeah. Unless it's like a tetris block or something the excuse that "they don't have enough moveset potential" is worthless.
>Obscure

I’m sure he is to anyone with their eyes closed during the Mario RPG hype cycle. He has a spot on the cover and everything.

>Side character 

This is flat out wrong. You play as Geno, he is a main character.

>Three people

Three *million* people, if the sales are to be believed.

>Who would be hyped?

Everyone who reacted to his inclusion as a Mii costume, as well as the three million people who played Mario RPG.
They've got a freaking piranha plant in the roster, why not add an actual character even if his design is just a waddle dee with a bandana and spear.
*Main
Who were they?
    Steve, Sora, and they keep putting in ROB. Funny enough, 3 characters I've seen the community say they are some of the most hated to fight against, so I feel I'm not alone
Sick flair brother ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|give_upvote)
Bro forgor Wario sadge
    Oh yeah but my man Wario have a different move set and taking that into account, Waluigi could have a different moveset too, but think I just don't like that skinny tall memeistic m0fo xd
        Luigi has a different move set too where is your logic
        [deleted]
            Easy man I'm not that smart, I mean Mario Luigi and Doc are pretty similar but not the same, whatever, I don't like waluigi cuz it's just a rancid meme by now.
Bad take.

There is not a lot of antihero characters vs full of hope, smiling protagonists
    Yes, But Don't you think fang or tails would offer more variety  and uniqueness?
>but IIRC he mostly uses psychic attacks.

He doesn't
why? its probably the most deserving indie franchise to get in
That’s his down B
    YO! Shadow Down b being Chaos Control (like Meta Knight's cape) sounds awesome
        Isn't that more like Witch Time?
            Chaos Control can both warp and slow time. And I don't think anyone, even Sonic players, want Witch Time Sonic.
                Ah well, he does do both as an Assist Trophy
                *coughs and raises finger* Well.......some of us might :P
                Your a Ridley main so shut up. U dont know what Sonic players want, while i know cause im one
        Dude I want shadow to have an Up B be a chaos control that spikes at the end of the hotbox like in his trailer on the alien lol
Barbara Broccoli and the Fleming estate are both NOTORIOUSLY picky about James Bond depictions outside of the books and movies. I feel like they would not like him being in a game where he can be thrown out of the ring by a monkey with a jet pack.
    IDK, I could totally see that scene being in one of the Moore films lol
        Well, yeah. Cubby Broccoli didn’t give a shit about bond’s image. I’m certain he would have been a-ok with Bond in Smash. The dude made Diamonds are Forever.
    “Barbara Broccoli”???
        Yes. She’s currently in charge of making James Bond films. The Bond films are actually a family business she inherited from her father, Albert Broccoli. Goldeneye was actually her debut film.
i kinda would have liked to see joana dark make it in though. The 2 classic game genres that immediately come to mind as not having reps are FPS's and beat em ups (the latter being very surprising actually).
    Sadly FPS ain't that popular (if at all) in Japan
        For now, the only fps character represented in Smash is Mario. Just because he's a representative of EVERY genre.
            I don't remember Mario ever being in an FPS. Samus, on the other hand, has a few.
                Yoshi's Safari.

And I did forget about Metroid Prime, my mistake.
Sakurai confirmed in an interview that Bond was at the bare minimum brought up during discussions, meaning he wasn’t out of the question, though you are right in that he probably didn’t progress much past that
    Well of course he'd get brought up, Goldeneye 64 is one of the iconic games of the N64.

The discussion could've just been something like *'hey here's why we aren't going to have James Bond as a playable character despite Goldeneye 64 being a super well known N64 game.'*
        The wording of the interview (I wish I could find the source but I was unable to) made it sound less like a “Here’s why he won’t be added” and more of a “We were considering adding him”

I feel like it’s kind of the inverse of the Snake in Melee situation where something happened that made it so it couldn’t happen for Melee and by the time Brawl rolled around they had their rules more set in stone
>I believe if we got a Rare character, priority would’ve been given to Banjo and Kazooie.

Thank goodness that didn't happen
A few characters that are highly likely to have gotten in if that happened are Spider-Man, Goku, TMNT, and a few others I’m sure I’m forgetting

Just… thank god that didn’t happen, as much as I’d love a character *like* James Bond, the actual James Bond isn’t it
We still get people begging for Goku and Shrek and whoever else though, so it wouldn't be much difference though.
All of the answers are *the* answers
    ![gif](giphy|uPnKU86sFa2fm)
damn he not getting in until the 720th game
Not all the DLC are top tier but a lot have ‘gimmicks’ and comeback mechanics that people don’t really like. For example banjo and sora are ‘dlc balanced’ and while they’re not overpowered many people don’t really enjoy fighting those characters.
    I don't enjoy fighting sora because of his voice and it giving me PTSD from the countless hours I put into the first two KH games hahah
You mean like Aegis, Joker, or Min Min, all of which have good arguments for being better than Kazuya?
    I don't think Minmin is top tier.  Joker and aegis are definitely up there.
        min min is the bayonetta of japan come on now
You say that, but Spring Man's showed more personality in Min Min's own Smash reveal than Min Min has in her entire existence.

I like Min Min and all, but I genuinely cannot see how people say she has more personality than Spring Man, who honestly has more personality than most other ARMS characters.
    I was hoping for the black chick. Get some sexy chocolate in the game
        What a fucking weird thing to say
        I don't know, it's the same character that fights woth her hair... in a game named ARMS.
            It would be messed up if some other hair based fighter got in first before Dixie.

Edit: No wait, forgot about Bayo. Crap.
Yeah it would be sonic with charge shot lol
I don't think he would be a zoner. His signature move is a projectile, and he is a soccer player, but he's also mainly a physically attacker in Pokémon, and would probably be more of a brawler in smash.
    A fire type starter Pokemon who's mainly a brawler you say? What a unique idea.
        This is the main reason I don't want Cinderace in Smash - we already have Incineroar, we don't need Incineroar but a rabbit with a football! And if the Smash team were considering making, for example, a faster, combo-based fire starter for instance, there are other fire starters that fit that bill considerably better than Cinderace, namely Blaziken and Infernape, and if they wanted a ranged fire starter, Delphox (or even Braixen if you want to cater to a certain subset of fans) would be a much better pick
    I see him being a better Greninja, maybe not as fast as ninja, but a good singular projectile to control space, and some good CQ moves, maybe a comeback mechanic, like a Z move (would say gigantamax but idk how that would translate to the game, probably more of a final smash.)
Probably doesn't help he came from a lineup of Final Evos that are basically just furries.

I know it's already kinda iffy, considering the existence of others like Delphox and Incineroar among others, but Gen 8 was like the creme de la creme of final evos being furries.
    Rillaboom was just a gorilla though.

Yeah, gorillas are primates and therefore look somewhat humanoid, but he still looked like an actual gorilla and not a anthropomorphized one.
        Rillaboom loses a lot of points from not being part drum
            It's a kids' game first and foremost, they couldn't have shown him drumming on his cheeks.
                It's a kid's game first and foremost, the main thing kids know about gorillas is that they beat their chest when fighting
    yeah but like… cinderace is cool.
What about a character like Geralt of Rivia? Sure, he started as a book character, but The Witcher 3 is a pillar of the RPG genre and definitely what he's known best from, plus he's appeared in a number of crossovers with other games before.
    Although i dont want Geralt in ssb i still think he counts since he’s from a game. A fun twist would be to add the same Disney characters that Are in the final fantasy games. Its better than someone who only appeared on the movies or in a book. 

On the other hand i would so be up for a lotr smash
        The idea is that they originated from a video game so Geralt might be best known from a game, he is not created from gaming. It's almost like saying spiderman is from the comics but best known from the MCU so therefore he's a movie character.
            I would say that the major difference there is that when most people think of Spiderman, they think of the comics, movies, AND games, since all three are quite popular. Geralt on the other hand, despite originally being from a (excellent) book series and appearing in a (shitty) Netflix adaptation, is by all accounts considered first and foremost a video game character in popular culture.
                Yah it's why I said "almost" about spiderman. He's not the best example but the main idea was that he did not originate from movies. Smash has a specific theme going and that theme simply was characters that originated from video games. All the non-nintendo characters originated from a video game even if they have a separate media presence like comics or anime. Smash went from a Nintendo only fighting game to a game that celebrated video gaming and it's history. Geralt's inclusion, regardless of his popularity, simply would have broken that theme.

Now the next Smash, if they wanna go all out on it, they can include whoever they want and be like a Smash version of Fortnight where everyone is included. Goku, Geralt and hell why not Hello Kitty
                    How is Geralt not part of a "celebration of gaming" though? He's a video game icon; Witcher 3 is one of the most celebrated and beloved games of the last decade, regardless of it being based on a book series. Geralt is most definitely not in the same category as the likes of Goku and Spiderman; no Dragon Ball or Spiderman game went many years being literally the most awarded game in history.
                        Dude you're not listening. He's not a video game character. He's a book character. Like Harry Potter is that also has video games that sold a shit ton. That's it. Nintendo aimed for characters that originated from video games. Geralt doesn't fit that ideal. If Nintendo wants to open the doors to book characters in the next smash, that's their choice but for Ultimate, characters that originated from video games. Geralt is a book character. End of story
                            By that logic neither is Master Chief; technically his first appearance was in the first Halo novel that released shortly before the first game in 2001. I don't think you'd find a single person on this Earth who would call Master Chief a book character.
            I think Dracula kinda enters that category but I guess people consider him an archetype now more than a character
Hell nah
Isnt that the skin from fortnite??
I wanna know what kind of logic you used to consider sonic, snake, and pit to be not from games
    Somic originated from comics, weeks before his game relase. The costume they use for snake originated from a comic, and pit is a character from stories (stretching)
        The sonic comics are there to promote the games, sonic is definitely a video game franchise first before anything
Hey genius I have to go written it from a game and primarily play in games
    I'm assuming you mean they are primarily from games and that's why most know them? Honestly the same thing is for goku, the games are fairly popular and inteoduce tons to the story.
        If the franchise originated in a game they can be in Smash Bros anime, manga, movie, and book characters cannot be in Smash Bros unless the franchise they are from is gaming
Yes, but he isn’t from that game, he’s just in it. He’s from an anime/manga.
But he was born from a manga, not from a videogame and the only rule to join smash is that a characters must be originated from a videogame (only exception is lucario)
    even then you could argue that lucario really is from pokemon and therefore "deserves" to be in

besides, it's a nintendo character. they are able to whatever tf they want with their characters
    Nah, Lucario is a video game character who had non-video game material release first, but mostly to promote the games he originated from, so he’s still a game character. Like Lightning McQueen appeared in the Cars game before he did for the Cars movie, but that doesn’t make him a video game character. 

I think the only real exception is Greninja, since the one in smash is canonically Ash-Greninja, and Ash is an anime character. Ash-Greninja does appear later in SuMo, but it’s only promotional material for the anime. An *almost* exception is Sephiroth, who Sakurai refers to as the Advent Children Sephiroth, with his design and mechanics being based off AC and his inclusion coming with tracks from the movie, which is pretty crazy.

There’s also other non-fighter exceptions, Goldeneye is referenced from 64-Brawl, with the motion sensor item being directly pulled from it in 64 and Melee. The assist trophy, Dr. Kawashima, is an actual real person. Mickey’s on Sora’s keychain.. and there’s probably some spirits ?
    wait how is lucario an exception lmao
        Because his first appearence was in a 2005 film
            Nope! He cameoed in PMD Red and Blue rescue team a few months before the film.
They mean characters that didn’t originate from a game
There's plenty of Dragon Ball games
    They have to be ORIGINALLY from a game not a game after its manga and anime.
I think Dragon Ball characters are one of the few exceptions because of the Budokai Tenkaichi series being such an iconic fighting game

The Dragon Ball franchise has had a handful of very strong video-game entries and has definitely left a decent mark in the industry. I'd go as far as to confidently say that the Xenoverse games are more iconic than the entirety of Bayonetta.

Yes, I believe Goku would fit right into Smash, and I want him in the game as a fighter.
No. Mario and Sonic video game characters that have appeared in movies, not movie characters that have appeared in video games. You can flip your question on its head and ask if Superman and Goku count as video game characters because they appear in games.
I’m talking about characters originating from movies and tv. Mario and Sonic do not
Rayman as playable and Rabbids as assist trophy would be neat
    Rayman as playable and rabbids as polygon mans would gorgeous.


Could you imagine ? 


Beating the crap out of them for hours ?
They want the thicc waifu
    Yes
i can attest this is the main reason i wanted her in.
She was the second on ARMS characters who I didn't want in because she technically doesn't use her arms as she doesn't have ARMS, but it is less egregious that Twintelle's lack of using her arms.
[removed]
    EXACTLY.
    [removed]
Did people actually say that?
    Yes they did

Tbf I do agree that Smash should have more black characters in it, but I'd rather not have an ARMS character with Witch Time.
        Well that's a wider problem with just a lack of black characters in gaming anyway.
        I don’t know why people were expecting her. She was the only one deconfirmed when it was announced that an ARMS character was coming.
    I saw some people who did, on Resetera specifically. Min Min was announced during the height of the protests against George Floyd's death, so people were hyper-aware about racial issues. Obviously there were a 100 issues with the train of thought. Twintelle doesn't use her arms and would have been an ill-fitting representation of ARMS as a result, Twintelle was mainly popular because of her ass, Min Min had good merits in her favor as the ARMS choice, Min Min was in development long before George Floyd died. And most importantly, an apolitical Japanese company is not going to change Smash Bros. DLC plans as a response to an American socio-political issue...
    they say that to not telt the thuth that they only want Twintelle for her ass
The three Pokemon have individual fighter numbers on [Nintendo's website](https://www.smashbros.com/en_US/fighter) (Charizard is #35), so I think he still counts as returning
I think him returning as part of Pokemon trainer counts as him returning.
Yeah that is fair, also nothing against him as a character in smash4, I'm just glad that if they were only gonna bring back either PT or Zard I'm glad it was PT
    with you on that one
I feel like Solozard 100% could’ve coexisted with Red ngl
    That would be weird as shit
bro would just kill children in a nintendo game 😭
Theres a rivals of aether moveset and a brawlfan1 moveset that answers that exact question
Yuh uh, what’s the moveset? As far as I’m aware springtrap is just a dead guy who used to murder children while disguised in mascot costumes. It would be really hard to create APPROPRIATE moves from this concept.
    There is a pretty cool rivals of aether mod for springtrap, obviously not everything would fit, (namely Uair, Dair, and Bair) as well as visual changes to fit the 3d environment, but it could work. The main problem would be the potentially graphic material involving springtrap’s design. If any fnaf character made it in, it would likely be Freddy himself, rather than springtrap.
    pull from fnaf world, the movie (knife, paranormal abilities?), and phantoms as well as just technological things used in fnaf since william is an engineer and genius and bam moveset
What did Scott do
Smash bad ryu and snake before it was cool
I don't care about the gameplay, fortnite is just everything I hate about corporate marketing in one game.
    I love it because it gives modders access to plenty of high quality 3d models, plenty of which have been made into smash mods.
    Yep. I know 'thing young people like = bad" is a common internet pattern, and I'm frequently guilty of it. But I see Fortnite as a soulless corporate attempt to replicate the community driven boom of Minecraft in the 2010's.
    boohoo you can play the game entirely for free but buy cool skins from other things you like so dystopian and capitalistic and terrible and scummy
        You can play the game for free until way down the road they inevitably pull the plug and since it's a live service game, that will just be the end. I despise the live service model that every modern game seems to have, especially since I have seen multiple games just become unplayable because of it. It also introduced battle passes to the gaming world which just spread like wildfire, so now every single modern game needs to have a battle pass with exclusive cosmetic items in it.
            >It also introduced battle passes to the gaming world which just spread like wildfire

Except it didn't. That was Dota 2.
                I'm not a fan of Dota 2 either tbh. But I never saw the influx of battle passes in other games until fortnite released.
Not to be rude but who cares if epic branches out their game? Keeping the game new and exciting is good for them and the industry
    No, it is not exciting for the industry.

Fortnite has the brand power to make themselves the one stop shop for all of gaming. That isn't healthy for the industry. Thats monopolistic.

No one wants a future where the best survival adventure, fps, rhythm game, fighting game, rpg, etc is a single game. You know why? Because realistically it will not be as good as what came before. It will be too spread thin, lacking nuance, well tuned gameplay, and content.

That's not to say they'll naturally succeed if they try this. They failed to dethrone Among Us as THE social deduction game.

But no, I don't think it's healthy or exciting. I prefer a game be one thing, and for it to do that one thing really well.
Imagine Jones building a whole suburb complex to block recoveries.
At this point Fortnitw has had so many items throughout its history they could probably make an all-melee moveset for him.
cant wait for him to be discovered as completely broken and have to be banned from tournaments after the game stops updating in smash 6
*rubs hands together mischievously* (I unironically love fortnite and mc tho no joke)
Personally I don't find Fortnite fun. Also Smash crossovers are VERY different from Fortnite's. Fortnite has huge movie IPs and such while Smash is a celebration of gaming (at this point). Fortnite is a celebration of pop culture. I don't remember Smash having famous rappers, movie characters, streamers, anime characters, etc being in it. Point being, Fortnite has IP that is more recognizable to the general public. More people know about Thanos, the Xenomorph, Optimus Prime, John Wick, Batman, Joker, Superman, etc over characters like Pyra/Mythra, Joker, King K. Rool, Terry Bogard, etc. Most characters in Smash are only big in the world of gaming.
Bro even at 999% he would be invunerable because he just want to keep runing a little
Why not Walter White from Breaking Bad?
But what could possibly go wrong
    He has no pilot's license so his recovery would suck ass.
Gotta be overwatch, fortnite basically has no IP
is adding chun li an option for fortnite
    Yeah but she comes in a package deal with Goku
        no goku is preferred because he has godlike powers from what ive heard and anime
Overwatch BY A MILE
    I think Tracer could be fun, but I'm not like begging for her to get in or anything.
yeah but tf2
look i like my zoner character and we dont need more (unless its another mega man character)
I strongly agree on the Belmonts sharing a slot issue. The funny thing, that also irritates me, is both of them use Simon's moves, but the things they take from Richter are the design of the cross, angling the whip diagonally, the final smash, and the slide kicks (if I'm not mistaken with all that). Richter's only different so his holy water can be blue thanks to aura. If they were gonna both be on the roster as different fighters, I'd want to see Richter's skills be shown off in a more creative way with Simon being much more direct from the source material. Either that or have Maria involved with Richter's moves somehow. I don't know enough about Soma to have a comment tho x.x
The down voting is for your own good
    I deserved it.
Yeah the more the better I was just stuck in a "only one" view but it's fine.
Yeah but obviously I meant 64 or TTYD or super, you make his moveset centered around his partners maybe a puppeteer archetype or like down B swaps partner which swaps his moveset or specials.
I think Paper Mario fans would be hype for Paper Mario, no matter which games he's more based off of. It's still Paper Mario.

Besides, the moveset would most likely be based off all the games.
    I dont think you understand just how much some paper mario fans hate the modern games. To alot of fans anything after super or even ttyd isn't real paper mario.
And as a MVC3 player, you are very valid for that. That motherfucker is TERRIFYING.
    Agreed
tbh, a cool idea would have waluigi be a complete representation of the mario spinoffs, mario kart being his side-b, mario tennis for his neutral, Mario party dice as a down-b
    And why him specifically? Other characters are present in those games as well.

I'll tell you why, because Waluigi has literally nothing else going for him, he's ASS.
        I mean, as far as I know, he's the only mario spinoff character that debuted from a spinoff title

Also, he would finally complete the mario, luigi, wario, waluigi set

Don't get me wrong, I don't side with the waluigi fans that harassed people for him, but I do think waluigi's inclusion deserves some merit
            Fans claim that Waluigi could be a rep for spin-offs.

Yet, the Piranha Plant has appeared in WAY more of them.

Heck! The Piranha Plant even appeared as a major enemy in Sunshine, the* one game that didn't have traditional enemies such as Goombas and Koopa Troopas STILL has Piranha Plants!

Waluigi is literally bottom of the barrel kind of stuff!
                Yeah, but pirahna plant was introduced in an actual Mario game and is iconic because they are a staple Mario enemy. Pirahna plant's inclusion represents their entire enemy archetype

but it doesn't specifically represent the mario spinoff party games, which waluigi is iconic for
                    Spin-Offs are usually determined by their environments, rules and items.

Those aspects have already* been implemented into the game.

The WarioWare stage basically works as Party Mini-Games, Mario Kart is already represented, multiple times, heck! Wario and Bowser Jr. Already have vehicles, and items are already a thing in the game, heck, Hero already implemented them into his moveset!

No Waluigi!
                        Honestly, valid, I appreciate your enthusiastic hate for Waluigi

No Waluigi!

        Justice for Toad
            Hes doing just peachy
I remember my brother in law telling me his late Fiance once cosplayed as edelgard to convince him to pick black eagles
Now let's not get crazy
Had to get my hot take out

But in reality, I’m glad that anyone from Fortnite didn’t get in

But I have a feeling that we’ll get Jonesy next game

We just gotta wait for the “Fortnite is Cringe” train to die down the same way the “Minecraft is Cringe” train did before we got Steve in Smash
    I mean, Fortnite would be a massive IP, but i dont think you can put Jonesy in smash, his move set would be like the construction of minecraft + weapons and zoner like snake
If steve is hard to fight imagine a Steve with proyectiles? Nah, bro
        I wouldn't mind it if they made them super lightweight but not floaty, and made it so they need to build on something instead of just mid air. That way, sure, they can build a little base and shoot you from afar, but if you can get close they are easy to kill
Bro! I’ve been telling people crash should be an incin skin since release! Nice to get some validation
>But Chief on the other hand...

You can do the same for him too.
Nonsense lol, optimal doom play is skirting and kiting around enemies which is the opposite of aggressive. Also dunno why we are talking about the 1 game that sold like shit in japan as a possibility
    > doom play is skirting and kiting around enemies

In modern Doom you use a chainsaw the refill your ammo and one of the main powerups is just ***punch***. Doom games clearly want you to feel fast and powerful, not skirt around the action. If they based characters off "optimal gameplay" Mario would have a BLJ.
        u missed the point where while yes, u use the chainsaw to regain health *the moment you try that faceup with tougher opponents you will get your face chewed off.*

The whole gameflow is to run around and attack opponents from behind, then go for the weaker minions for health. doesn't sound so "manly", huh?

  
also i really don't get 2 shits mainly since there are twenty other reasons he's not getting in, so just saying "ehhh he's super aggro, good for smash, trust" is whatever at the end of the day
The settlement isn’t even accurate doom doesn’t want you to get too close because demons have devastating attacks that can hurt the player nor do they want you to play far back because it will take too much time to kill demons. The mid range is where players live and breath
Also How would you make an aggressive rush down fighter with guns??????? Saying they can limit the range doesn’t change anything because unless his range is limited to being ridiculously close to his body than he would still be played as a zoner
    Modern Doom is all about movement and even in the classic Doom games Doom Guy is very fast.

>Saying they can limit the range doesn’t change anything because unless his range is limited to being ridiculously close to his body than he would still be played as a zoner

Look at Noel from BlazBlue
        * Modern Doom is all about movement and even in the classic Doom games Doom Guy is very fast.

And that changes if he will be a zoner or not?

* Look at Noel from BlazBlue

Most of her gun attacks don’t even shoot bullets just muzzle flashes bad example lol
            Did you even read my original comment...?
                Yes and I’m explaining to you no matter what you say “ he is fast, he is aggressive, he is this he is that”

There is almost  no way he ends up as a rush down character especially when  Most of his attacks would use guns!!!!

No seriously think about it what character in smash can play as a rush down character while simultaneously mostly using multiple ranged projectile attacks? Dude would at best be a mid range zoner. The archetype your envisioning is close to impossible and doesn’t even accurately represent the games
i think most irrelevant mario character that can be considered part of the main cast, because i really haven’t seen many poison pokey fans as of late
    I personally want Shroobsworth.
I definitely wouldn’t say he’s the MOST irrelevant Nintendo character, but he’s definitely the most irrelevant that people keep asking for. You don’t see people going “yo they should add Lot from fire emblem 6! He’d be a perfect fit!”, because he’s far less relevant than waluigi, and also from a game few people have played. Waluigi is at least in several games people played, from Mario karts to Mario sport games.
    I’d say his lack of relevance has more to do with how he has no bearing in the Mario universe even if the games _he happens to appear on_ are very popular. Even Fire Emblem characters are more relevant within their own niche, and the same can be said about Min Min for ARMS and Pyra/Mythra for Xenoblade. Waluigi was literally created _for_ the party games and that’s why he’s stayed there ever since. He has absolutely nothing going for him.
Waluigi was literally created to fill a gap during Mario Tennis 64’s development. He’s really only in Mario games now because why not.
For many many many fans (id be willing to bet for most people who own the game(s) actually), smash bros IS a party game though, and id still say hes more relevant than the freakin ice climbers
What does Waluigi have going for him that other characters in from other games or even other Mario characters don't do better?
    He has popularity and iconicity on his side. He's one of the biggest requests for Smash at the moment, something that was noted by Nintendo themselves, which is certainly something he has going for him over most other characters. He's also not some obscure, irrelevant, one-off character like the Ice Climbers, Lucas, or fellow Mario request Geno. He's been in over 50 games (excluding things like ports) and been playable in nearly every single one of them means that he's honestly more-recognizable than a good chunk of the Smash roster. And he's not going to stop appearing either. Unless Nintendo pulls another Mario Kart 7, he'll show up in every single kart/party/sports spinoff that gets released. His appearances will keep growing in number, and he will never be irrelevant.

Another thing is moveset potential. It's no secret that the Mario spinoffs aren't exactly represented very well in Smash, despite being a big and important part of the overall Mario series. Because Waluigi is (unfortunately) exclusive to the Mario spinoffs, he could represent them in his moveset. Driving a kart to ram into foes? Using an Item Box from Mario Kart? Throwing a Dice Block from Mario Party? Using different sports equipment like tennis rackets, golf clubs, and baseball bats? You name it.

You don't even have to go with a spinoff-themed moveset for him to make him stand out from the rest of the cast. Waluigi's always been a really weird and random character with a plethora of recurring moves all throughout the series. Swimming in midair as if it was water? Spinning around like a cyclone? Summoning thorny vines from the ground to ensnare foes? Turning the baseball he's pitching absolutely gigantic? He can do all of that. He's also got an affinity for dancing, moreso than most other Mario characters, and you could incorporate that into his moveset to give him some stylish and flashy-looking moves. Heck, you could even give him a Smash-original move that fits his sneaky and whacky personality, like K. Rool's Gut Check or Incineroar's Alolan Whip.

What he's got going for him is immense popularity and iconicity, 20+ years of countless appearances that are only growing in number, and a moveset that could be very different from anyone we currently have in Smash, especially if the team gets real creative with him. Is that not enough to warrant a roster spot?
        Popularity is one thing but it should be the only thing that really justifies him.

Pretty much everything that Waluigi can do other characters can do already and his unique stuff isn't very unique. He doesn't have any that would create a unique gimmick like Rosalina has with Luma. Pretty much all of the spin off content is already represented with items, stages, and attacks, so there isn't really a need to create a new character to represent what is already in the game.

And even then are better Mario characters like Toad who is present in every spin of evening running them, has a significance to the mainline Mario games, a connection to power ups which is often what steps Mario spins off apart from the sports they are based on, and is more recognizable than Waluigi.

Waluigi really only has popularity backing him up, and that is it. There isn't really a demand for the "unique" that Waluigi would bring gameplay wise as a majority of it is already represented or could be represented by other characters who would bring more to the table. And there are just other popular characters who could be added to bring something unique to Smash instead of just another Mario character. Other Nintendo series could get their time to shine, popular third party characters could be added to appease a larger crowd, or there could even be a Persona situation where a smaller IP that isn't that big in the eyes of the general gaming community could get thrusted into the spotlight.

I never really understood this sort of thing. Waluigi can't get into Smash because other characters and series wouldn't get their time to shine?

You can add both, you know. Waluigi could get in, as well as someone like a new Zelda character, or Bandana Dee for the Kirby fans, or Octoling for Splatoon fans. New series like Golden Sun, Astral Chain, Rhythm Heaven, etc. could get in too. And most popular 3rd-parties get added as DLC anyways, whereas Waluigi would absolutely be a base game pick, so I don't really see competition between the two.

Smash 4's base game had *two* Mario newcomers, three characters from Nintendo series already on the roster, *five* newcomers from new Nintendo series (six if you count the Miis), and two big 3rd-parties. Why don't they just do that again?
                Development time and resources and it is limited meaning that not everyone can get into Smash so they have to pick and choose characters. The Mario series has the most representation out of every series and has all of the main characters present with maybe the exception of Toad does it really need more characters just for the sake of having more Mario representation? The devs have to choose which characters get in and which characters don't make the cut, and adding characters from series with smaller character representation or a completely new series would be way more interesting and impactful than adding Waluigi who really adds nothing other than his inclusion. At the end of the day Waluigi would just be another Mario character and not even someone who has anything to bring that is unique gameplay wise like a character such as Rosalina who has the Luma gimmick.
                    >The Mario series has the most representation out of every series and has all of the main characters present with maybe the exception of Toad does it really need more characters just for the sake of having more Mario representation?

While Mario does have a lot of characters, 1, it's Mario, duh it's gonna have a lot of characters, 2, we're probably going to get at least a few unique Mario characters get cut next time, shrinking down the franchise's roster. Also yes, Toad really does need to be here, because holy sh\*t he should've been here since Melee.

&#x200B;

>and adding characters from series with smaller character representation or a completely new series would be way more interesting and impactful than adding Waluigi who really adds nothing other than his inclusion

Would a character as massively-requested as Waluigi not be impactful? The guy's one of the few 1st-party characters left that would generate the same level of hype and wish fulfillment as Ridley and King K. Rool, how would that not be impactful?

&#x200B;

>not even someone who has anything to bring that is unique gameplay wise like a character such as Rosalina who has the Luma gimmick.

Would a unique moveset not bring something new to the table? You say he wouldn't have Rosalina's Luma gimmick, but not every newcomer gets a gimmick to begin with. What was Ridley's gimmick? Simon's? Piranha Plant's? Byleth's? And yet they all still have unique movesets anyway. Also, who's to say they can't just make up an original gimmick for him? It's not like Marth's tipper was a feature in his home games or anything, or Lucario getting stronger the more it was hurt was a feature from Pokémon.
        He’s so iconic he’s never been in a mainline Mario game. Even Toadette’s been in a mainline game
            The fact that he's still so popular and iconic despite never having been in a mainline game just shows that the spinoffs really are a huge and important part of the overall Mario series, and yet this fanbase acts like they don't even exist or don't deserve much recognition.
I always picked Waluigi in Nintendo party games, I want him in because all my other friends get their party game reps in the game lol
Government psy-op, you aren't real, you aren't real, GET OUT OF MY HEAD
Smash isn't supposed to fill quotas
    Agreed, but still feels weird.
Smash is for gaming Icons. Waluigi isn't the icon of anything except memes about waluigi not being in smash
    I mean by that logic we really don’t need 3 links… or Plant. I get your point overall tho
        Tbh we actually don't. The roster had many picks that were highly dependant on the speciohic moment the game came out or that were included for other serendipitous reasons.
        Toon Link is certainly iconic. Young Link, not so much. Plant is a clear middle finger to Waluigi, that's iconic enough.
            Eh I wouldn’t necessarily say iconic… I feel like they could represent them all in 1 Link.
                I’d say young link can go
                I’d say young link can go
            Plant has been in many more games that Waluigi. Goomba probably would have been a better "iconic" enemy rep imo but as far as significant representation in games I think plant outweighs Waluigi.
                Goomba and Koopa far outweigh Plant. If it had anything to do with repping Mario enemies, they'd be first choice.
                    If that’s the case I wouldn’t mind a PT style called bowsers baddies or something with Goomba, Koopa, and either Boo or Bob-omb
        I agree lol. We don't need 3 links or a plant. 

Or a Waluigi
            Yeah, or Doctor Mario. Or hell 7 very similar FE characters, I’d be fine with another fighter but they could give us an axe, spear, or polearm user that has a new style. Fun fact, I don’t think there’s a single fighter that ONLY uses a spear in all of SSBU
                On fact there isn't and is the main reason why i am super angry at the FE roster. Like, i support Bandana Dee just because he use a spear, i din't even play kirby games anymore.
                > 7 very similar FE characters

Why'd you have to go and undermine your solid point with dumb ignorance? Yes, there's Marth, Marth's Echo fighter, Marth's Clone, and Marth's Clone's Echo fighter, but that's only four, and pretending that any of the others are similar to them in any way that isn't "they come from Fire Emblem and have a sword" is ignorant at best. Sure, there isn't a lance user, and there absolutely should be, doesn't discredit the current FE reps at all
    Ah yes, my favorite gaming icons.

Sheik, Lucas, Ice Climbers, Roy, Piranha Plant, Dark Pit, and Pichu.
    >Smash is for gaming Icons

Honestly don't understand why people keep saying this it's just flat out wrong. There's so many characters in smash that are nowhere near "icons" yet people still treat smash like it's this exclusive club where only the best of the best can get in.
It's a government pysop I'm telling you, none of you are real, GET OUT OF MY WALLS
    But it's cosy in here :\[
Steve was added because he is the face of the largest, best selling game ever made lol wtf do you mean, he literally is THE icon of modern gaming. Minecraft alone has sold more than every Nintendo franchise except Pokemon and Super Mario. And that's one game vs entire franchises
Do you really think Steve was added for the memes?
    Nintendo fans often live in strange bubbles where they clearly ignore the largest gaming world. See the fact that most of them still see Crash as a PS representetive.
Thats false
And he is. But he's cute and Kirby fans are crazy for cuteness. He's literally like a Goomba but uses a spear. That's it, knows how to throw a spear
But imagine him using those vines from *Mario Strikers Charged*, then using an "air swimming" ability, then whatever special move he has in another sports spin-off, it would make him look tike some sort of magic user, that deffinitely doesn't fit with the rest of Mario characters
    ...Okay?

Does he *need* to fit in with the other Mario characters? I'm sorry, I just don't see why him not """fitting in""" is a big deal?

In my opinion, I honestly think that fits him more, if anything. In the grand family that is the Mario franchise, Waluigi is like that one weird uncle that no one really talks to at family gatherings and crotch chops a lot. Being weird and out-of-place is what makes Waluigi... Waluigi.
I mean, I don't deny a TF2 character would have a good moveset. I personally just don't like the game
To quote SMG4:

Waluigi Launcher
From my understanding, it's cuz he's basically the fourth main protagonist. He's been getting bigger and bigger roles in games, even being playable sometimes, so I take it as people wanting the quartet of Kirby, Dedede, Meta Knight and BDee playable in Smash.

Not to say he deserves a spot more than, say, Dark Matter, but that's how I see it.
    Personally, I've always wanted Magalor instead. People clamor for Modern Kirby representation, and Magalor is probably the most promoted post-Sakurai character, even getting his own side mode in the latest game. He'd likely have a much more interesting moveset than BWD, plus he'd be a mage character, which is an archetype in Smash that we don't really see a lot of
    Bandana Dee's basically the Luigi to Kirby's Mario, so I think he deserves to be in Smash cause of that.
Well using that logic almost every video game character could be in Smash because Sakurai and his team "have enough skill to give them an interesting moveset"
    I mean yeah. Unless it's like a tetris block or something the excuse that "they don't have enough moveset potential" is worthless.
    I mean yeah. Unless it's like a tetris block or something the excuse that "they don't have enough moveset potential" is worthless.
Steve, Sora, and they keep putting in ROB. Funny enough, 3 characters I've seen the community say they are some of the most hated to fight against, so I feel I'm not alone
Oh yeah but my man Wario have a different move set and taking that into account, Waluigi could have a different moveset too, but think I just don't like that skinny tall memeistic m0fo xd
    Luigi has a different move set too where is your logic
    [deleted]
        Easy man I'm not that smart, I mean Mario Luigi and Doc are pretty similar but not the same, whatever, I don't like waluigi cuz it's just a rancid meme by now.
Yes, But Don't you think fang or tails would offer more variety  and uniqueness?
YO! Shadow Down b being Chaos Control (like Meta Knight's cape) sounds awesome
    Isn't that more like Witch Time?
        Chaos Control can both warp and slow time. And I don't think anyone, even Sonic players, want Witch Time Sonic.
            Ah well, he does do both as an Assist Trophy
            *coughs and raises finger* Well.......some of us might :P
            Your a Ridley main so shut up. U dont know what Sonic players want, while i know cause im one
    Dude I want shadow to have an Up B be a chaos control that spikes at the end of the hotbox like in his trailer on the alien lol
IDK, I could totally see that scene being in one of the Moore films lol
    Well, yeah. Cubby Broccoli didn’t give a shit about bond’s image. I’m certain he would have been a-ok with Bond in Smash. The dude made Diamonds are Forever.
“Barbara Broccoli”???
    Yes. She’s currently in charge of making James Bond films. The Bond films are actually a family business she inherited from her father, Albert Broccoli. Goldeneye was actually her debut film.
Sadly FPS ain't that popular (if at all) in Japan
    For now, the only fps character represented in Smash is Mario. Just because he's a representative of EVERY genre.
        I don't remember Mario ever being in an FPS. Samus, on the other hand, has a few.
            Yoshi's Safari.

And I did forget about Metroid Prime, my mistake.
Well of course he'd get brought up, Goldeneye 64 is one of the iconic games of the N64.

The discussion could've just been something like *'hey here's why we aren't going to have James Bond as a playable character despite Goldeneye 64 being a super well known N64 game.'*
    The wording of the interview (I wish I could find the source but I was unable to) made it sound less like a “Here’s why he won’t be added” and more of a “We were considering adding him”

I feel like it’s kind of the inverse of the Snake in Melee situation where something happened that made it so it couldn’t happen for Melee and by the time Brawl rolled around they had their rules more set in stone
![gif](giphy|uPnKU86sFa2fm)
I don't enjoy fighting sora because of his voice and it giving me PTSD from the countless hours I put into the first two KH games hahah
I don't think Minmin is top tier.  Joker and aegis are definitely up there.
    min min is the bayonetta of japan come on now
I was hoping for the black chick. Get some sexy chocolate in the game
    What a fucking weird thing to say
    I don't know, it's the same character that fights woth her hair... in a game named ARMS.
        It would be messed up if some other hair based fighter got in first before Dixie.

Edit: No wait, forgot about Bayo. Crap.
A fire type starter Pokemon who's mainly a brawler you say? What a unique idea.
    This is the main reason I don't want Cinderace in Smash - we already have Incineroar, we don't need Incineroar but a rabbit with a football! And if the Smash team were considering making, for example, a faster, combo-based fire starter for instance, there are other fire starters that fit that bill considerably better than Cinderace, namely Blaziken and Infernape, and if they wanted a ranged fire starter, Delphox (or even Braixen if you want to cater to a certain subset of fans) would be a much better pick
I see him being a better Greninja, maybe not as fast as ninja, but a good singular projectile to control space, and some good CQ moves, maybe a comeback mechanic, like a Z move (would say gigantamax but idk how that would translate to the game, probably more of a final smash.)
Rillaboom was just a gorilla though.

Yeah, gorillas are primates and therefore look somewhat humanoid, but he still looked like an actual gorilla and not a anthropomorphized one.
    Rillaboom loses a lot of points from not being part drum
        It's a kids' game first and foremost, they couldn't have shown him drumming on his cheeks.
            It's a kid's game first and foremost, the main thing kids know about gorillas is that they beat their chest when fighting
yeah but like… cinderace is cool.
Although i dont want Geralt in ssb i still think he counts since he’s from a game. A fun twist would be to add the same Disney characters that Are in the final fantasy games. Its better than someone who only appeared on the movies or in a book. 

On the other hand i would so be up for a lotr smash
    The idea is that they originated from a video game so Geralt might be best known from a game, he is not created from gaming. It's almost like saying spiderman is from the comics but best known from the MCU so therefore he's a movie character.
        I would say that the major difference there is that when most people think of Spiderman, they think of the comics, movies, AND games, since all three are quite popular. Geralt on the other hand, despite originally being from a (excellent) book series and appearing in a (shitty) Netflix adaptation, is by all accounts considered first and foremost a video game character in popular culture.
            Yah it's why I said "almost" about spiderman. He's not the best example but the main idea was that he did not originate from movies. Smash has a specific theme going and that theme simply was characters that originated from video games. All the non-nintendo characters originated from a video game even if they have a separate media presence like comics or anime. Smash went from a Nintendo only fighting game to a game that celebrated video gaming and it's history. Geralt's inclusion, regardless of his popularity, simply would have broken that theme.

Now the next Smash, if they wanna go all out on it, they can include whoever they want and be like a Smash version of Fortnight where everyone is included. Goku, Geralt and hell why not Hello Kitty
                How is Geralt not part of a "celebration of gaming" though? He's a video game icon; Witcher 3 is one of the most celebrated and beloved games of the last decade, regardless of it being based on a book series. Geralt is most definitely not in the same category as the likes of Goku and Spiderman; no Dragon Ball or Spiderman game went many years being literally the most awarded game in history.
                    Dude you're not listening. He's not a video game character. He's a book character. Like Harry Potter is that also has video games that sold a shit ton. That's it. Nintendo aimed for characters that originated from video games. Geralt doesn't fit that ideal. If Nintendo wants to open the doors to book characters in the next smash, that's their choice but for Ultimate, characters that originated from video games. Geralt is a book character. End of story
                        By that logic neither is Master Chief; technically his first appearance was in the first Halo novel that released shortly before the first game in 2001. I don't think you'd find a single person on this Earth who would call Master Chief a book character.
        I think Dracula kinda enters that category but I guess people consider him an archetype now more than a character
Somic originated from comics, weeks before his game relase. The costume they use for snake originated from a comic, and pit is a character from stories (stretching)
    The sonic comics are there to promote the games, sonic is definitely a video game franchise first before anything
I'm assuming you mean they are primarily from games and that's why most know them? Honestly the same thing is for goku, the games are fairly popular and inteoduce tons to the story.
    If the franchise originated in a game they can be in Smash Bros anime, manga, movie, and book characters cannot be in Smash Bros unless the franchise they are from is gaming
even then you could argue that lucario really is from pokemon and therefore "deserves" to be in

besides, it's a nintendo character. they are able to whatever tf they want with their characters
Nah, Lucario is a video game character who had non-video game material release first, but mostly to promote the games he originated from, so he’s still a game character. Like Lightning McQueen appeared in the Cars game before he did for the Cars movie, but that doesn’t make him a video game character. 

I think the only real exception is Greninja, since the one in smash is canonically Ash-Greninja, and Ash is an anime character. Ash-Greninja does appear later in SuMo, but it’s only promotional material for the anime. An *almost* exception is Sephiroth, who Sakurai refers to as the Advent Children Sephiroth, with his design and mechanics being based off AC and his inclusion coming with tracks from the movie, which is pretty crazy.

There’s also other non-fighter exceptions, Goldeneye is referenced from 64-Brawl, with the motion sensor item being directly pulled from it in 64 and Melee. The assist trophy, Dr. Kawashima, is an actual real person. Mickey’s on Sora’s keychain.. and there’s probably some spirits ?
wait how is lucario an exception lmao
    Because his first appearence was in a 2005 film
        Nope! He cameoed in PMD Red and Blue rescue team a few months before the film.
They have to be ORIGINALLY from a game not a game after its manga and anime.
Rayman as playable and rabbids as polygon mans would gorgeous.


Could you imagine ? 


Beating the crap out of them for hours ?
Yes
EXACTLY.
[removed]
Yes they did

Tbf I do agree that Smash should have more black characters in it, but I'd rather not have an ARMS character with Witch Time.
    Well that's a wider problem with just a lack of black characters in gaming anyway.
    I don’t know why people were expecting her. She was the only one deconfirmed when it was announced that an ARMS character was coming.
I saw some people who did, on Resetera specifically. Min Min was announced during the height of the protests against George Floyd's death, so people were hyper-aware about racial issues. Obviously there were a 100 issues with the train of thought. Twintelle doesn't use her arms and would have been an ill-fitting representation of ARMS as a result, Twintelle was mainly popular because of her ass, Min Min had good merits in her favor as the ARMS choice, Min Min was in development long before George Floyd died. And most importantly, an apolitical Japanese company is not going to change Smash Bros. DLC plans as a response to an American socio-political issue...
they say that to not telt the thuth that they only want Twintelle for her ass
with you on that one
That would be weird as shit
There is a pretty cool rivals of aether mod for springtrap, obviously not everything would fit, (namely Uair, Dair, and Bair) as well as visual changes to fit the 3d environment, but it could work. The main problem would be the potentially graphic material involving springtrap’s design. If any fnaf character made it in, it would likely be Freddy himself, rather than springtrap.
pull from fnaf world, the movie (knife, paranormal abilities?), and phantoms as well as just technological things used in fnaf since william is an engineer and genius and bam moveset
I love it because it gives modders access to plenty of high quality 3d models, plenty of which have been made into smash mods.
Yep. I know 'thing young people like = bad" is a common internet pattern, and I'm frequently guilty of it. But I see Fortnite as a soulless corporate attempt to replicate the community driven boom of Minecraft in the 2010's.
boohoo you can play the game entirely for free but buy cool skins from other things you like so dystopian and capitalistic and terrible and scummy
    You can play the game for free until way down the road they inevitably pull the plug and since it's a live service game, that will just be the end. I despise the live service model that every modern game seems to have, especially since I have seen multiple games just become unplayable because of it. It also introduced battle passes to the gaming world which just spread like wildfire, so now every single modern game needs to have a battle pass with exclusive cosmetic items in it.
        >It also introduced battle passes to the gaming world which just spread like wildfire

Except it didn't. That was Dota 2.
            I'm not a fan of Dota 2 either tbh. But I never saw the influx of battle passes in other games until fortnite released.
No, it is not exciting for the industry.

Fortnite has the brand power to make themselves the one stop shop for all of gaming. That isn't healthy for the industry. Thats monopolistic.

No one wants a future where the best survival adventure, fps, rhythm game, fighting game, rpg, etc is a single game. You know why? Because realistically it will not be as good as what came before. It will be too spread thin, lacking nuance, well tuned gameplay, and content.

That's not to say they'll naturally succeed if they try this. They failed to dethrone Among Us as THE social deduction game.

But no, I don't think it's healthy or exciting. I prefer a game be one thing, and for it to do that one thing really well.
He has no pilot's license so his recovery would suck ass.
Yeah but she comes in a package deal with Goku
    no goku is preferred because he has godlike powers from what ive heard and anime
I think Tracer could be fun, but I'm not like begging for her to get in or anything.
I deserved it.
I dont think you understand just how much some paper mario fans hate the modern games. To alot of fans anything after super or even ttyd isn't real paper mario.
Agreed
And why him specifically? Other characters are present in those games as well.

I'll tell you why, because Waluigi has literally nothing else going for him, he's ASS.
    I mean, as far as I know, he's the only mario spinoff character that debuted from a spinoff title

Also, he would finally complete the mario, luigi, wario, waluigi set

Don't get me wrong, I don't side with the waluigi fans that harassed people for him, but I do think waluigi's inclusion deserves some merit
        Fans claim that Waluigi could be a rep for spin-offs.

Yet, the Piranha Plant has appeared in WAY more of them.

Heck! The Piranha Plant even appeared as a major enemy in Sunshine, the* one game that didn't have traditional enemies such as Goombas and Koopa Troopas STILL has Piranha Plants!

Waluigi is literally bottom of the barrel kind of stuff!
            Yeah, but pirahna plant was introduced in an actual Mario game and is iconic because they are a staple Mario enemy. Pirahna plant's inclusion represents their entire enemy archetype

but it doesn't specifically represent the mario spinoff party games, which waluigi is iconic for
                Spin-Offs are usually determined by their environments, rules and items.

Those aspects have already* been implemented into the game.

The WarioWare stage basically works as Party Mini-Games, Mario Kart is already represented, multiple times, heck! Wario and Bowser Jr. Already have vehicles, and items are already a thing in the game, heck, Hero already implemented them into his moveset!

No Waluigi!
                    Honestly, valid, I appreciate your enthusiastic hate for Waluigi

No Waluigi!

    Justice for Toad
        Hes doing just peachy
I mean, Fortnite would be a massive IP, but i dont think you can put Jonesy in smash, his move set would be like the construction of minecraft + weapons and zoner like snake
If steve is hard to fight imagine a Steve with proyectiles? Nah, bro
    I wouldn't mind it if they made them super lightweight but not floaty, and made it so they need to build on something instead of just mid air. That way, sure, they can build a little base and shoot you from afar, but if you can get close they are easy to kill
> doom play is skirting and kiting around enemies

In modern Doom you use a chainsaw the refill your ammo and one of the main powerups is just ***punch***. Doom games clearly want you to feel fast and powerful, not skirt around the action. If they based characters off "optimal gameplay" Mario would have a BLJ.
    u missed the point where while yes, u use the chainsaw to regain health *the moment you try that faceup with tougher opponents you will get your face chewed off.*

The whole gameflow is to run around and attack opponents from behind, then go for the weaker minions for health. doesn't sound so "manly", huh?

  
also i really don't get 2 shits mainly since there are twenty other reasons he's not getting in, so just saying "ehhh he's super aggro, good for smash, trust" is whatever at the end of the day
Modern Doom is all about movement and even in the classic Doom games Doom Guy is very fast.

>Saying they can limit the range doesn’t change anything because unless his range is limited to being ridiculously close to his body than he would still be played as a zoner

Look at Noel from BlazBlue
    * Modern Doom is all about movement and even in the classic Doom games Doom Guy is very fast.

And that changes if he will be a zoner or not?

* Look at Noel from BlazBlue

Most of her gun attacks don’t even shoot bullets just muzzle flashes bad example lol
        Did you even read my original comment...?
            Yes and I’m explaining to you no matter what you say “ he is fast, he is aggressive, he is this he is that”

There is almost  no way he ends up as a rush down character especially when  Most of his attacks would use guns!!!!

No seriously think about it what character in smash can play as a rush down character while simultaneously mostly using multiple ranged projectile attacks? Dude would at best be a mid range zoner. The archetype your envisioning is close to impossible and doesn’t even accurately represent the games
I personally want Shroobsworth.
I’d say his lack of relevance has more to do with how he has no bearing in the Mario universe even if the games _he happens to appear on_ are very popular. Even Fire Emblem characters are more relevant within their own niche, and the same can be said about Min Min for ARMS and Pyra/Mythra for Xenoblade. Waluigi was literally created _for_ the party games and that’s why he’s stayed there ever since. He has absolutely nothing going for him.
He has popularity and iconicity on his side. He's one of the biggest requests for Smash at the moment, something that was noted by Nintendo themselves, which is certainly something he has going for him over most other characters. He's also not some obscure, irrelevant, one-off character like the Ice Climbers, Lucas, or fellow Mario request Geno. He's been in over 50 games (excluding things like ports) and been playable in nearly every single one of them means that he's honestly more-recognizable than a good chunk of the Smash roster. And he's not going to stop appearing either. Unless Nintendo pulls another Mario Kart 7, he'll show up in every single kart/party/sports spinoff that gets released. His appearances will keep growing in number, and he will never be irrelevant.

Another thing is moveset potential. It's no secret that the Mario spinoffs aren't exactly represented very well in Smash, despite being a big and important part of the overall Mario series. Because Waluigi is (unfortunately) exclusive to the Mario spinoffs, he could represent them in his moveset. Driving a kart to ram into foes? Using an Item Box from Mario Kart? Throwing a Dice Block from Mario Party? Using different sports equipment like tennis rackets, golf clubs, and baseball bats? You name it.

You don't even have to go with a spinoff-themed moveset for him to make him stand out from the rest of the cast. Waluigi's always been a really weird and random character with a plethora of recurring moves all throughout the series. Swimming in midair as if it was water? Spinning around like a cyclone? Summoning thorny vines from the ground to ensnare foes? Turning the baseball he's pitching absolutely gigantic? He can do all of that. He's also got an affinity for dancing, moreso than most other Mario characters, and you could incorporate that into his moveset to give him some stylish and flashy-looking moves. Heck, you could even give him a Smash-original move that fits his sneaky and whacky personality, like K. Rool's Gut Check or Incineroar's Alolan Whip.

What he's got going for him is immense popularity and iconicity, 20+ years of countless appearances that are only growing in number, and a moveset that could be very different from anyone we currently have in Smash, especially if the team gets real creative with him. Is that not enough to warrant a roster spot?
    Popularity is one thing but it should be the only thing that really justifies him.

Pretty much everything that Waluigi can do other characters can do already and his unique stuff isn't very unique. He doesn't have any that would create a unique gimmick like Rosalina has with Luma. Pretty much all of the spin off content is already represented with items, stages, and attacks, so there isn't really a need to create a new character to represent what is already in the game.

And even then are better Mario characters like Toad who is present in every spin of evening running them, has a significance to the mainline Mario games, a connection to power ups which is often what steps Mario spins off apart from the sports they are based on, and is more recognizable than Waluigi.

Waluigi really only has popularity backing him up, and that is it. There isn't really a demand for the "unique" that Waluigi would bring gameplay wise as a majority of it is already represented or could be represented by other characters who would bring more to the table. And there are just other popular characters who could be added to bring something unique to Smash instead of just another Mario character. Other Nintendo series could get their time to shine, popular third party characters could be added to appease a larger crowd, or there could even be a Persona situation where a smaller IP that isn't that big in the eyes of the general gaming community could get thrusted into the spotlight.

I never really understood this sort of thing. Waluigi can't get into Smash because other characters and series wouldn't get their time to shine?

You can add both, you know. Waluigi could get in, as well as someone like a new Zelda character, or Bandana Dee for the Kirby fans, or Octoling for Splatoon fans. New series like Golden Sun, Astral Chain, Rhythm Heaven, etc. could get in too. And most popular 3rd-parties get added as DLC anyways, whereas Waluigi would absolutely be a base game pick, so I don't really see competition between the two.

Smash 4's base game had *two* Mario newcomers, three characters from Nintendo series already on the roster, *five* newcomers from new Nintendo series (six if you count the Miis), and two big 3rd-parties. Why don't they just do that again?
            Development time and resources and it is limited meaning that not everyone can get into Smash so they have to pick and choose characters. The Mario series has the most representation out of every series and has all of the main characters present with maybe the exception of Toad does it really need more characters just for the sake of having more Mario representation? The devs have to choose which characters get in and which characters don't make the cut, and adding characters from series with smaller character representation or a completely new series would be way more interesting and impactful than adding Waluigi who really adds nothing other than his inclusion. At the end of the day Waluigi would just be another Mario character and not even someone who has anything to bring that is unique gameplay wise like a character such as Rosalina who has the Luma gimmick.
                >The Mario series has the most representation out of every series and has all of the main characters present with maybe the exception of Toad does it really need more characters just for the sake of having more Mario representation?

While Mario does have a lot of characters, 1, it's Mario, duh it's gonna have a lot of characters, 2, we're probably going to get at least a few unique Mario characters get cut next time, shrinking down the franchise's roster. Also yes, Toad really does need to be here, because holy sh\*t he should've been here since Melee.

&#x200B;

>and adding characters from series with smaller character representation or a completely new series would be way more interesting and impactful than adding Waluigi who really adds nothing other than his inclusion

Would a character as massively-requested as Waluigi not be impactful? The guy's one of the few 1st-party characters left that would generate the same level of hype and wish fulfillment as Ridley and King K. Rool, how would that not be impactful?

&#x200B;

>not even someone who has anything to bring that is unique gameplay wise like a character such as Rosalina who has the Luma gimmick.

Would a unique moveset not bring something new to the table? You say he wouldn't have Rosalina's Luma gimmick, but not every newcomer gets a gimmick to begin with. What was Ridley's gimmick? Simon's? Piranha Plant's? Byleth's? And yet they all still have unique movesets anyway. Also, who's to say they can't just make up an original gimmick for him? It's not like Marth's tipper was a feature in his home games or anything, or Lucario getting stronger the more it was hurt was a feature from Pokémon.
    He’s so iconic he’s never been in a mainline Mario game. Even Toadette’s been in a mainline game
        The fact that he's still so popular and iconic despite never having been in a mainline game just shows that the spinoffs really are a huge and important part of the overall Mario series, and yet this fanbase acts like they don't even exist or don't deserve much recognition.
Agreed, but still feels weird.
I mean by that logic we really don’t need 3 links… or Plant. I get your point overall tho
    Tbh we actually don't. The roster had many picks that were highly dependant on the speciohic moment the game came out or that were included for other serendipitous reasons.
    Toon Link is certainly iconic. Young Link, not so much. Plant is a clear middle finger to Waluigi, that's iconic enough.
        Eh I wouldn’t necessarily say iconic… I feel like they could represent them all in 1 Link.
            I’d say young link can go
            I’d say young link can go
        Plant has been in many more games that Waluigi. Goomba probably would have been a better "iconic" enemy rep imo but as far as significant representation in games I think plant outweighs Waluigi.
            Goomba and Koopa far outweigh Plant. If it had anything to do with repping Mario enemies, they'd be first choice.
                If that’s the case I wouldn’t mind a PT style called bowsers baddies or something with Goomba, Koopa, and either Boo or Bob-omb
    I agree lol. We don't need 3 links or a plant. 

Or a Waluigi
        Yeah, or Doctor Mario. Or hell 7 very similar FE characters, I’d be fine with another fighter but they could give us an axe, spear, or polearm user that has a new style. Fun fact, I don’t think there’s a single fighter that ONLY uses a spear in all of SSBU
            On fact there isn't and is the main reason why i am super angry at the FE roster. Like, i support Bandana Dee just because he use a spear, i din't even play kirby games anymore.
            > 7 very similar FE characters

Why'd you have to go and undermine your solid point with dumb ignorance? Yes, there's Marth, Marth's Echo fighter, Marth's Clone, and Marth's Clone's Echo fighter, but that's only four, and pretending that any of the others are similar to them in any way that isn't "they come from Fire Emblem and have a sword" is ignorant at best. Sure, there isn't a lance user, and there absolutely should be, doesn't discredit the current FE reps at all
Ah yes, my favorite gaming icons.

Sheik, Lucas, Ice Climbers, Roy, Piranha Plant, Dark Pit, and Pichu.
>Smash is for gaming Icons

Honestly don't understand why people keep saying this it's just flat out wrong. There's so many characters in smash that are nowhere near "icons" yet people still treat smash like it's this exclusive club where only the best of the best can get in.
But it's cosy in here :\[
Nintendo fans often live in strange bubbles where they clearly ignore the largest gaming world. See the fact that most of them still see Crash as a PS representetive.
...Okay?

Does he *need* to fit in with the other Mario characters? I'm sorry, I just don't see why him not """fitting in""" is a big deal?

In my opinion, I honestly think that fits him more, if anything. In the grand family that is the Mario franchise, Waluigi is like that one weird uncle that no one really talks to at family gatherings and crotch chops a lot. Being weird and out-of-place is what makes Waluigi... Waluigi.
Personally, I've always wanted Magalor instead. People clamor for Modern Kirby representation, and Magalor is probably the most promoted post-Sakurai character, even getting his own side mode in the latest game. He'd likely have a much more interesting moveset than BWD, plus he'd be a mage character, which is an archetype in Smash that we don't really see a lot of
Bandana Dee's basically the Luigi to Kirby's Mario, so I think he deserves to be in Smash cause of that.
I mean yeah. Unless it's like a tetris block or something the excuse that "they don't have enough moveset potential" is worthless.
I mean yeah. Unless it's like a tetris block or something the excuse that "they don't have enough moveset potential" is worthless.
Luigi has a different move set too where is your logic
[deleted]
    Easy man I'm not that smart, I mean Mario Luigi and Doc are pretty similar but not the same, whatever, I don't like waluigi cuz it's just a rancid meme by now.
Isn't that more like Witch Time?
    Chaos Control can both warp and slow time. And I don't think anyone, even Sonic players, want Witch Time Sonic.
        Ah well, he does do both as an Assist Trophy
        *coughs and raises finger* Well.......some of us might :P
        Your a Ridley main so shut up. U dont know what Sonic players want, while i know cause im one
Dude I want shadow to have an Up B be a chaos control that spikes at the end of the hotbox like in his trailer on the alien lol
Well, yeah. Cubby Broccoli didn’t give a shit about bond’s image. I’m certain he would have been a-ok with Bond in Smash. The dude made Diamonds are Forever.
Yes. She’s currently in charge of making James Bond films. The Bond films are actually a family business she inherited from her father, Albert Broccoli. Goldeneye was actually her debut film.
For now, the only fps character represented in Smash is Mario. Just because he's a representative of EVERY genre.
    I don't remember Mario ever being in an FPS. Samus, on the other hand, has a few.
        Yoshi's Safari.

And I did forget about Metroid Prime, my mistake.
The wording of the interview (I wish I could find the source but I was unable to) made it sound less like a “Here’s why he won’t be added” and more of a “We were considering adding him”

I feel like it’s kind of the inverse of the Snake in Melee situation where something happened that made it so it couldn’t happen for Melee and by the time Brawl rolled around they had their rules more set in stone
min min is the bayonetta of japan come on now
What a fucking weird thing to say
I don't know, it's the same character that fights woth her hair... in a game named ARMS.
    It would be messed up if some other hair based fighter got in first before Dixie.

Edit: No wait, forgot about Bayo. Crap.
This is the main reason I don't want Cinderace in Smash - we already have Incineroar, we don't need Incineroar but a rabbit with a football! And if the Smash team were considering making, for example, a faster, combo-based fire starter for instance, there are other fire starters that fit that bill considerably better than Cinderace, namely Blaziken and Infernape, and if they wanted a ranged fire starter, Delphox (or even Braixen if you want to cater to a certain subset of fans) would be a much better pick
Rillaboom loses a lot of points from not being part drum
    It's a kids' game first and foremost, they couldn't have shown him drumming on his cheeks.
        It's a kid's game first and foremost, the main thing kids know about gorillas is that they beat their chest when fighting
The idea is that they originated from a video game so Geralt might be best known from a game, he is not created from gaming. It's almost like saying spiderman is from the comics but best known from the MCU so therefore he's a movie character.
    I would say that the major difference there is that when most people think of Spiderman, they think of the comics, movies, AND games, since all three are quite popular. Geralt on the other hand, despite originally being from a (excellent) book series and appearing in a (shitty) Netflix adaptation, is by all accounts considered first and foremost a video game character in popular culture.
        Yah it's why I said "almost" about spiderman. He's not the best example but the main idea was that he did not originate from movies. Smash has a specific theme going and that theme simply was characters that originated from video games. All the non-nintendo characters originated from a video game even if they have a separate media presence like comics or anime. Smash went from a Nintendo only fighting game to a game that celebrated video gaming and it's history. Geralt's inclusion, regardless of his popularity, simply would have broken that theme.

Now the next Smash, if they wanna go all out on it, they can include whoever they want and be like a Smash version of Fortnight where everyone is included. Goku, Geralt and hell why not Hello Kitty
            How is Geralt not part of a "celebration of gaming" though? He's a video game icon; Witcher 3 is one of the most celebrated and beloved games of the last decade, regardless of it being based on a book series. Geralt is most definitely not in the same category as the likes of Goku and Spiderman; no Dragon Ball or Spiderman game went many years being literally the most awarded game in history.
                Dude you're not listening. He's not a video game character. He's a book character. Like Harry Potter is that also has video games that sold a shit ton. That's it. Nintendo aimed for characters that originated from video games. Geralt doesn't fit that ideal. If Nintendo wants to open the doors to book characters in the next smash, that's their choice but for Ultimate, characters that originated from video games. Geralt is a book character. End of story
                    By that logic neither is Master Chief; technically his first appearance was in the first Halo novel that released shortly before the first game in 2001. I don't think you'd find a single person on this Earth who would call Master Chief a book character.
    I think Dracula kinda enters that category but I guess people consider him an archetype now more than a character
The sonic comics are there to promote the games, sonic is definitely a video game franchise first before anything
If the franchise originated in a game they can be in Smash Bros anime, manga, movie, and book characters cannot be in Smash Bros unless the franchise they are from is gaming
Because his first appearence was in a 2005 film
    Nope! He cameoed in PMD Red and Blue rescue team a few months before the film.
Well that's a wider problem with just a lack of black characters in gaming anyway.
I don’t know why people were expecting her. She was the only one deconfirmed when it was announced that an ARMS character was coming.
You can play the game for free until way down the road they inevitably pull the plug and since it's a live service game, that will just be the end. I despise the live service model that every modern game seems to have, especially since I have seen multiple games just become unplayable because of it. It also introduced battle passes to the gaming world which just spread like wildfire, so now every single modern game needs to have a battle pass with exclusive cosmetic items in it.
    >It also introduced battle passes to the gaming world which just spread like wildfire

Except it didn't. That was Dota 2.
        I'm not a fan of Dota 2 either tbh. But I never saw the influx of battle passes in other games until fortnite released.
no goku is preferred because he has godlike powers from what ive heard and anime
I mean, as far as I know, he's the only mario spinoff character that debuted from a spinoff title

Also, he would finally complete the mario, luigi, wario, waluigi set

Don't get me wrong, I don't side with the waluigi fans that harassed people for him, but I do think waluigi's inclusion deserves some merit
    Fans claim that Waluigi could be a rep for spin-offs.

Yet, the Piranha Plant has appeared in WAY more of them.

Heck! The Piranha Plant even appeared as a major enemy in Sunshine, the* one game that didn't have traditional enemies such as Goombas and Koopa Troopas STILL has Piranha Plants!

Waluigi is literally bottom of the barrel kind of stuff!
        Yeah, but pirahna plant was introduced in an actual Mario game and is iconic because they are a staple Mario enemy. Pirahna plant's inclusion represents their entire enemy archetype

but it doesn't specifically represent the mario spinoff party games, which waluigi is iconic for
            Spin-Offs are usually determined by their environments, rules and items.

Those aspects have already* been implemented into the game.

The WarioWare stage basically works as Party Mini-Games, Mario Kart is already represented, multiple times, heck! Wario and Bowser Jr. Already have vehicles, and items are already a thing in the game, heck, Hero already implemented them into his moveset!

No Waluigi!
                Honestly, valid, I appreciate your enthusiastic hate for Waluigi

No Waluigi!

Justice for Toad
    Hes doing just peachy
I wouldn't mind it if they made them super lightweight but not floaty, and made it so they need to build on something instead of just mid air. That way, sure, they can build a little base and shoot you from afar, but if you can get close they are easy to kill
u missed the point where while yes, u use the chainsaw to regain health *the moment you try that faceup with tougher opponents you will get your face chewed off.*

The whole gameflow is to run around and attack opponents from behind, then go for the weaker minions for health. doesn't sound so "manly", huh?

  
also i really don't get 2 shits mainly since there are twenty other reasons he's not getting in, so just saying "ehhh he's super aggro, good for smash, trust" is whatever at the end of the day
* Modern Doom is all about movement and even in the classic Doom games Doom Guy is very fast.

And that changes if he will be a zoner or not?

* Look at Noel from BlazBlue

Most of her gun attacks don’t even shoot bullets just muzzle flashes bad example lol
    Did you even read my original comment...?
        Yes and I’m explaining to you no matter what you say “ he is fast, he is aggressive, he is this he is that”

There is almost  no way he ends up as a rush down character especially when  Most of his attacks would use guns!!!!

No seriously think about it what character in smash can play as a rush down character while simultaneously mostly using multiple ranged projectile attacks? Dude would at best be a mid range zoner. The archetype your envisioning is close to impossible and doesn’t even accurately represent the games
Popularity is one thing but it should be the only thing that really justifies him.

Pretty much everything that Waluigi can do other characters can do already and his unique stuff isn't very unique. He doesn't have any that would create a unique gimmick like Rosalina has with Luma.

Other Nintendo series could get their time to shine, popular third party characters could be added to appease a larger crowd, or there could even be a Persona situation where a smaller IP that isn't that big in the eyes of the general gaming community could get thrusted into the spotlight.

I think Dracula kinda enters that category but I guess people consider him an archetype now more than a character
Nope! He cameoed in PMD Red and Blue rescue team a few months before the film.
>It also introduced battle passes to the gaming world which just spread like wildfire

Except it didn't. That was Dota 2.
    I'm not a fan of Dota 2 either tbh. But I never saw the influx of battle passes in other games until fortnite released.
Fans claim that Waluigi could be a rep for spin-offs.

Yet, the Piranha Plant has appeared in WAY more of them.

Heck! The Piranha Plant even appeared as a major enemy in Sunshine, the* one game that didn't have traditional enemies such as Goombas and Koopa Troopas STILL has Piranha Plants!

Waluigi is literally bottom of the barrel kind of stuff!
    Yeah, but pirahna plant was introduced in an actual Mario game and is iconic because they are a staple Mario enemy. Pirahna plant's inclusion represents their entire enemy archetype

but it doesn't specifically represent the mario spinoff party games, which waluigi is iconic for
        Spin-Offs are usually determined by their environments, rules and items.

Those aspects have already* been implemented into the game.

The WarioWare stage basically works as Party Mini-Games, Mario Kart is already represented, multiple times, heck! Wario and Bowser Jr. Already have vehicles, and items are already a thing in the game, heck, Hero already implemented them into his moveset!

No Waluigi!
            Honestly, valid, I appreciate your enthusiastic hate for Waluigi

Hes doing just peachy
Did you even read my original comment...?
    Yes and I’m explaining to you no matter what you say “ he is fast, he is aggressive, he is this he is that”

There is almost  no way he ends up as a rush down character especially when  Most of his attacks would use guns!!!!

No seriously think about it what character in smash can play as a rush down character while simultaneously mostly using multiple ranged projectile attacks? Dude would at best be a mid range zoner. The archetype your envisioning is close to impossible and doesn’t even accurately represent the games
>And there are just other popular characters who could be added to bring something unique to Smash instead of just another Mario character. Other Nintendo series could get their time to shine, popular third party characters could be added to appease a larger crowd, or there could even be a Persona situation where a smaller IP that isn't that big in the eyes of the general gaming community could get thrusted into the spotlight.

I never really understood this sort of thing. Waluigi can't get into Smash because other characters and series wouldn't get their time to shine?

You can add both, you know. Waluigi could get in, as well as someone like a new Zelda character, or Bandana Dee for the Kirby fans, or Octoling for Splatoon fans. New series like Golden Sun, Astral Chain, Rhythm Heaven, etc. could get in too. And most popular 3rd-parties get added as DLC anyways, whereas Waluigi would absolutely be a base game pick, so I don't really see competition between the two.

Smash 4's base game had *two* Mario newcomers, three characters from Nintendo series already on the roster, *five* newcomers from new Nintendo series (six if you count the Miis), and two big 3rd-parties. Why don't they just do that again?
    Development time and resources and it is limited meaning that not everyone can get into Smash so they have to pick and choose characters. The Mario series has the most representation out of every series and has all of the main characters present with maybe the exception of Toad does it really need more characters just for the sake of having more Mario representation? The devs have to choose which characters get in and which characters don't make the cut, and adding characters from series with smaller character representation or a completely new series would be way more interesting and impactful than adding Waluigi who really adds nothing other than his inclusion. At the end of the day Waluigi would just be another Mario character and not even someone who has anything to bring that is unique gameplay wise like a character such as Rosalina who has the Luma gimmick.
        >The Mario series has the most representation out of every series and has all of the main characters present with maybe the exception of Toad does it really need more characters just for the sake of having more Mario representation?

While Mario does have a lot of characters, 1, it's Mario, duh it's gonna have a lot of characters, 2, we're probably going to get at least a few unique Mario characters get cut next time, shrinking down the franchise's roster. Also yes, Toad really does need to be here, because holy sh\*t he should've been here since Melee.

&#x200B;

>and adding characters from series with smaller character representation or a completely new series would be way more interesting and impactful than adding Waluigi who really adds nothing other than his inclusion

Would a character as massively-requested as Waluigi not be impactful? The guy's one of the few 1st-party characters left that would generate the same level of hype and wish fulfillment as Ridley and King K. Rool, how would that not be impactful?

&#x200B;

>not even someone who has anything to bring that is unique gameplay wise like a character such as Rosalina who has the Luma gimmick.

Would a unique moveset not bring something new to the table? You say he wouldn't have Rosalina's Luma gimmick, but not every newcomer gets a gimmick to begin with. What was Ridley's gimmick? Simon's? Piranha Plant's? Byleth's? And yet they all still have unique movesets anyway. Also, who's to say they can't just make up an original gimmick for him? It's not like Marth's tipper was a feature in his home games or anything, or Lucario getting stronger the more it was hurt was a feature from Pokémon.
The fact that he's still so popular and iconic despite never having been in a mainline game just shows that the spinoffs really are a huge and important part of the overall Mario series, and yet this fanbase acts like they don't even exist or don't deserve much recognition.
Eh I wouldn’t necessarily say iconic… I feel like they could represent them all in 1 Link.
    I’d say young link can go
    I’d say young link can go
Plant has been in many more games that Waluigi. Goomba probably would have been a better "iconic" enemy rep imo but as far as significant representation in games I think plant outweighs Waluigi.
    Goomba and Koopa far outweigh Plant. If it had anything to do with repping Mario enemies, they'd be first choice.
        If that’s the case I wouldn’t mind a PT style called bowsers baddies or something with Goomba, Koopa, and either Boo or Bob-omb
Yeah, or Doctor Mario. Or hell 7 very similar FE characters, I’d be fine with another fighter but they could give us an axe, spear, or polearm user that has a new style. Fun fact, I don’t think there’s a single fighter that ONLY uses a spear in all of SSBU
    On fact there isn't and is the main reason why i am super angry at the FE roster. Like, i support Bandana Dee just because he use a spear, i din't even play kirby games anymore.
    > 7 very similar FE characters

Why'd you have to go and undermine your solid point with dumb ignorance? Yes, there's Marth, Marth's Echo fighter, Marth's Clone, and Marth's Clone's Echo fighter, but that's only four, and pretending that any of the others are similar to them in any way that isn't "they come from Fire Emblem and have a sword" is ignorant at best. Sure, there isn't a lance user, and there absolutely should be, doesn't discredit the current FE reps at all
Ah well, he does do both as an Assist Trophy
*coughs and raises finger* Well.......some of us might :P
Your a Ridley main so shut up. U dont know what Sonic players want, while i know cause im one
Yoshi's Safari.

And I did forget about Metroid Prime, my mistake.
It's a kid's game first and foremost, the main thing kids know about gorillas is that they beat their chest when fighting
Yah it's why I said "almost" about spiderman. He's not the best example but the main idea was that he did not originate from movies. Smash has a specific theme going and that theme simply was characters that originated from video games. All the non-nintendo characters originated from a video game even if they have a separate media presence like comics or anime. Smash went from a Nintendo only fighting game to a game that celebrated video gaming and it's history. Geralt's inclusion, regardless of his popularity, simply would have broken that theme.

Now the next Smash, if they wanna go all out on it, they can include whoever they want and be like a Smash version of Fortnight where everyone is included. Goku, Geralt and hell why not Hello Kitty
    How is Geralt not part of a "celebration of gaming" though? He's a video game icon; Witcher 3 is one of the most celebrated and beloved games of the last decade, regardless of it being based on a book series. Geralt is most definitely not in the same category as the likes of Goku and Spiderman; no Dragon Ball or Spiderman game went many years being literally the most awarded game in history.
        Dude you're not listening. He's not a video game character. He's a book character. Like Harry Potter is that also has video games that sold a shit ton. That's it. Nintendo aimed for characters that originated from video games. Geralt doesn't fit that ideal.
