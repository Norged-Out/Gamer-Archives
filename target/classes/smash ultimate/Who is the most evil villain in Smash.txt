[[Who is the most evil villain in Smash]]





Ridley. Sephy and Kazuya at least have excuses, Ridley’s just a sadistic engine of destruction.
    Don’t they call Ridley the God of Death or something??
        The Cunning God of Death
            Right it was that. What a fitting name…
            I just call him the Cunt, for shorts.
                Remember kids call men cunts and women cuntettes
                Holy Shit, that was funny. Thank you for the good laugh
    Sephy's been driven insane, Kazuya is now willfully evil after influence but can be restrained. 

Ridley is an actual fucking serial killer that eats parents in front of their children.
        Yeah and caused samus to become orphaned(which causes her to have PTSD of Ridley and she also obtains her power suit
    What in god’s name is Kazuya’s excuse? Parental negligence? He met more than enough people across the world to know that not everyone is as bad as Heihachi. My guy is just a bonafide rat bastard of a man, actively enjoying making others suffer, justifying his actions with social darwinism, and in Tekken 8(spoilers);

I.E.; ruthless bitch
        So, Ridley's that but on a Galactic level.
            Yeah, afaik kazoo didn’t EAT anyone

Yet…
        Child abuse and devil gene. Don't make for the best combo for a well mentally balanced and emotionally stable adult.
        His dad threw him down a cliff when he was a kid…
            Yeah, and he did it back to him. Twice over. Do me a favour and don’t try to defend the genocidal maniac, this isn’t AOT
                It wasn’t defending them so much as pointing out that had things been different for them growing up they could have been potentially good people.

Ridley on the other hand is just naturally evil/ruthless, in every incarnation, even from birth and when shown affection
                    Naturally evil ≠ most evil. I would argue that ganon or (to a much smaller extent) bowser are the most evil villains because their goals don’t stop. Ganon has a hatred that keeps him coming back throughout time in Zelda just to conquer hyrule but ultimately fails each time just to revive because of his hatred of the hero. Bowser goes about it wrong usually but he’s usually about world/galactic domination and kidnapping peach, while this usually ends up with bowser defeated (and there are games where bowser temporarily teams up with Mario) he always comes back with a bigger(possibly better) plan to rule the mushroom kingdom or galaxy depending on the game. Ridley being born sadistic isn’t evil it’s just what he was born as. It takes someone who was once good to do the worst evils imo and while ganon and bowser aren’t exactly the most evil I don’t think Ridley is all that evil either like he’s a bad creature but he’s not as evil as the games make him out he’s just a sadistic monster who hates people or something. I can’t speak to kazuya or sephiroth’s character so I’ll leave it at that
        Good point. 

Ridely did destroys planets for fun and enjoys torturing others. He also has no history of mental abuse or similar. 

Ridely also doesn't wash his hands after using the restroom.
            That sick monster!

HOW CAN YOU NOT WASH YOUR HANDS?!
        To be fair, sephiroth had a psychological breakdown after learning he had been lied to his entire life about his family. His attempt to destroy the planet only came close to working because of how powerful he just happened to be when he had the meltdown.
        But his sneaker collection,,,
    *Ganondorf
        Ganondorf just wants a fight

I think ridley because he attacks planets and kills lifeforms just for fun
    >kills lifeforms

what a weird way to just say murder
        nono he terminates organism’s lifespans don’t you get it?
            "This is not war, this is pest control!"

* Ridley
                Ridley is a mutated Dalek confirmed?
                    He's a xenolek
                        Well, now I'm imagining a tiny Dalek bursting out of someone's chest. Which would admittedly be horrifying as you'd hear a muffled "exterminate" followed by a muffled to not muffled "Ex...ter...mi...." ~explodes out of chest~ "nate"!

Edit: and the whole time of course the guy is screaming his head off while his chest begins glowing brighter and brighter blue.
                            Lol I imagine it would be like a Russian doll where the guy bursts out of the dalek and the xeno bursts out the guy
                    I don't know much about Doctor Who but I thought all Daleks were mutated, then genetically modified and turned into cyborgs?


If so Ridley is basically what they could achieve if they weren't mutated.
                        They're not Cyborgs. They're a lifeform that are encased in a battle armor. A mutated Dalek is not a Dalek because it would be deemed imperfect. Daleks are in their eyes the superior lifeform and nothing else is worthy of life.

Pure hatred for anything other than Dalek. They were created through genetic modification but once Dalek they approve of nothing else.

The Daleks were once forced to be recreated by genetically modifying human DNA and their own technology didn't recognize them as Dalek so they had to trick the Doctor into confirming they were Dalek so they could create pure Daleks again.

As soon as the new pure Daleks were created they forced the impure ones to self destruct because they were not Dalek.
                            Thanks for the lore. Always love me some lore.
                                Heck yeah, lore is life.
                I would genuinely believe he said this in the manga
                If that’s his thoughts then he’s not so evil he just doesn’t think of us as equals I mean if you tallied up all the mosquitoes you’ve killed and it’s like 10,000 or something your not evil but if Ridley does his version of that it’s a war crime for killing 10,000 humans.
            He puts em six feet under, got ‘em sleepin with the fishes, takes ‘em for a ride, gives ‘em acid bath, buy ‘em some cement shoes, get ‘em fitted for a coffin,  drives ‘em to the farm upstate, puts ‘em down, put ‘em to bed, makes ‘em see the pearly gates, they’ll be pushing up daisies, snuffed, croaked, un-alived, he’ll give ‘em suicide assistance, a real dirt nap, the big sleep, fill ‘em fulla lead, really let ‘em have it…

… and he’ll kill ‘em too!
        Murder, kill... it's ultimately meaningless when the end result is all the same.
        Doesn't the term "murder" only apply if the killer and the killed are of the same species? I don't think Ridley is that particilar with his killing.
            No, it refers to the intentional killing of a human by another human.

But that's only because humans are the only animals we know we a similar intelligence.

So one could extend it to a person killing another person if you could find non-human persons.
        Murder only applies to humans
            and crows...
        Murder refers to the killing of humans.

You could extend it to other beings with a level of sentience complex enough to be called "a person", but still limited to killing people.

Ridley kills everything, not just people, and so it isn't murder.
            Its murder. Stop.
        "It wasn't"murder" your Honour, my client was merely ending lifeforms. Helping nature in its cycle.
    His rant to Samus in the Zero Mission manga about how disgusting her dad tasted is the stuff of legends.
        True, it comes off as so petty. I feel like the only Nintendo villains pettier than him are the  two dream spirits from Kirby, Nightmare and Elfilis. Both of them were willing to crash two planetary bodies together just to take out Kirby (though tbf it's only in the anime for Nightmare, and I can probably find way more examples of  pettiness from all of the villains in there). PS, it was Samus' mother that was eaten, iirc her dad blew himself up with all of the space pirates when he was guarding a cargo ship.
    You do realize Ridley started the entire series right(samus only got her power suit because Ridley killed her parents
        Does that somehow make him less evil?
            No I don’t think so
                Samus even has PTSD of Ridley (shown in other m and Ridley’s reveal trailer)
                    Do you have a point you're making here or did you just word your comment weirdly as if you did? I'm not sure what you're trying to say here.
                    That other m PTSD thing is stupid and you know it. Also I’m pretty sure the reveal trailer was just her being caught off guard considering it ends with her going straight for him.
        Twice, mind you 

He waited for her to get adopted and then killed her new parents
    Sephiroth literally tried to do the same
        Key word tried, I love FF7 but Ridley has killed multiple planets worth of creatures. If by any chance sephiroth won he probably would have traveled the galaxy consuming other planets, but he never made it that far
            Also Sephiroth did it out of some obsession for Jevona and a messiah complex where Ridley did it multiple time just because he could
                And depending on how canon you consider the Manga to be, he also killed and ate Samus' parents in front of her knowing they were related to her.
            I mean yeah, but this is in regards to how evil they are, and they were both determined to do the same thing just for the sake of it, it’s just one managed to succeed, but they’re both just as evil. Also the answer for this is technically like Galeem/Dharkon no?
                If intent matters then so does reason, no?

If Sephiroth does it for his mother (or something) and Ridley does it for entertainment and sadistic pleasure then Ridley takes the medal?
        His goal wasn't just to hurt and kill, it was to gain power, and eventually to create a new world. He was indifferent to the pain he caused, but it wasn't his goal... except Cloud, he loved fucking with Cloud.
    God forbid people have fun. 🙄
    So does Kirby
    he impaled mario and megaman with no hesitation
Ridley because he doesn't have a motive, he just kills for fun
    How are you going to put two humans (or at least appearing as human) against someone who's literally just a giant dragon monster, there was no winning for them
Ridley. It’s Ridley. Sephiroth and Ganondorf are bad but at least they’re not doing shit just for fun
    Ridley straight up said to Samus that their parents were protein bars to him.
        Sephiroth killed clouds mom completely unnecessarily on his way out of burning down his home town because he felt like it, and forces cloud to relive the moment at random through induced hallucinations, just to torment him lol.
            Ridley killed samus's parents in front of her, and years later after he found out that she had foster parents, he killed them in front of her too
                If I remember correctly, he ate the bodies after for his own survival
                    Yeah and literally sent samus into a fucking PTSD driven shock where she literally begged for someone to kill her because she thought ridley's murder of the whole planet was inevitable
                        We don't talk about Other M.
            And killed his friend aerith in front of him, and his party
        They *might have been. He didn’t actually discern whether or not it was her parents because he didn’t care enough to make note of who he was eating.
    I dunno.. Sephiroth basically sees people as ants in the way. And he wants to exterminate them all so he can use the earth as a ship to explore space. I feel like that’s more evil than a deranged space pirate killing for fun.
        Sephiroth has a motive, a strange one, a motive nonetheless

Ridley is just in it for fun, I doubt he even cares about the whole pirate part of his job and just uses it to kill
            I don’t really follow that logic. It’s like saying a dictator who commits genocide because he thinks his people are superior is less evil than a thrill seeking serial killer. Someone who kills for fun is just fucked in the head. Someone who is actually coherent and justifies their actions is way more evil imo.
                After he meets MB, he does become contractually obligated to have a motive, which is forcing the galaxy into “peace” by killing everyone who disagrees with them, most notably, the Galactic Federation
                i think you forgot that the thrill serial killer has a higher body count than the dictator
                    Body count isnt really relevant. We’re talking about fundamental personality. By your logic, Ridley is more evil than Frieza from Dragonball because he just kills for fun, but Frieza has murdered trillions.
                I don’t know why this is getting downvoted, makes sense to me
                    Because it apparently feels good to downvote benign video game opinions you don’t agree with lmao.
                        Isn't disagreeing like... the point of downvotes?
                            Not really. It’s to block out misinformation / hate, unrelated / off-topic discussion, etc. gives the person bad karma and prevents the spread of their post. After a certain number the post gets hidden, etc. If you disagree with someone’s benign opinion you talk about it with them. It’s just that it’s really easy to just downvote so it has become a tool to pile-on, but thats not what it’s really for.

The official word on the purpose of downvotes from Reddit themselves: 

>Vote. If you think something contributes to conversation, upvote it. If you think it does not contribute to the subreddit it is posted in or is off-topic in a particular community, downvote it.

So if someone asks “which villain is the most evil?”, and I say A and you say B, we can talk about it.. no one needs to dowvote because its all on topic lol. If I came in and say “Toyota’s are fantastic cars” then the purpose of a downvote is to hide unrelated posts or offensive posts etc. but people feel better about themselves when they do it apparently. I almost never downvote vote because off topic / offensive stuff is almost always already gone by the time I get in threads.
                                I mean, you downvoted literally every opinion I made that disagreed with you lol. So I assumed you were saying you disagreed with me in those situations.
                                    Oof doesn't look great to be sanctimonious about downvotes but still use them like everyone else 💀 sucks for him I guess
                                    I did it because everyone was doing it to me lol. So I should correct that, I only senselessly downvote when it’s senselessly done to my on-topic post. Have you seen all my posts on here? I assumed you were doing it to mine. Lol
                                Maybe that's the intended use, but the social climate dictates that's just how it be. Not everyone is gonna want to have a civilised discussion, or has the time, so the downvote becomes a good way to express agreement or disagreement with a comment
                                    Im just answering the question you asked.
                Well the thing is that Ridley is part of the space pirates, who in Prime 3 essentially have attempted to genocide entire planets to turn them into fuel for their weapons.
                    Okay? I don’t see how that changes anything. If anything that just gives him a motivation, but one less interesting but one none-the-less.
        Having a motive for killing is less “evil” than doing it for the lol’s. 

One wouldn’t kill without the motive, it’s just something they have to do to accomplish their goals. The other one literally derives pleasure from the act of evil.
            I disagree with that. In fact, BECAUSE they have a motive many of the motivated villains derive pleasure from killing as well. If not more. Sephiroth DEFINITELY enjoys killing people, for example. I said it in another reply but I’ll repeat here: a dictator who kills people because he believes his people are better then everyone else is far more evil, and also takes delight in killing, versus someone who just takes delight in killing. I fail to see how the latter is worse thn someone who knows fully well its wrong, enjoys it, AND thinks it’s righteous to do.
                Yes, they think it’s righteous to do so, which means they **do not believe** what they are doing is evil. These people would not kill without motive. 

The person who kills for fun knows what they’re doing is wrong and **does not care**. That is literally the definition of evil. They revel in their wickedness and amorality.
                    It doesnt matter if they would kill with or without motive if the motive is that everyone but them should be dead lmao.
                        Yes, but the key difference is **both** of these villains want everyone dead. Except one thinks it’s right, the other knows it’s wrong and LIKES that. 

That is empirically, literally, more evil by definition. Profoundly immoral and wicked. 

Sephiroth is less evil than Ridley. But that’s a good thing, because he has more depth as a character.
                            It doesn’t make a difference to me. Especially since Sephiroth very clearly also enjoys it. He’s like ridley but with his actions being righteous added on top of it. He literally wields a cloud of tormented souls that he wont let pass on to the afterlife. He’s not just on a crusade, he’s also sadistic. He didn’t have to kill aerith, he didnt have to kill clouds mom, or pretty much anyone else he killed. He just wanted to, and revels in it.
                                Yes, Sephiroth revels in it because he believes it is his divine right. He believes he is exacting moral, righteous vengeance against the people who genocided his ancestors. He’s like the Doom Slayer, who takes pleasure in murdering demons because he believes all of them are evil. They both view their killing and torture as justified and it’s strictly a matter of perspective. 

That is not more evil than someone killing because “fuck yeah evil.” I just like murder, hoo rah. 

Like I don’t know how to make it any more obvious lol. You’re arguing against the very definition of what evil is. At this point I can only assume you’re a big fan of Sephiroth so you **want** him to be the most evil in this situation but you’re actively advocating for Sephiroth to be way edgier and lamer than he actually is.
                                    You can assume whatever you want, but it’s just a difference of opinion, and we have 3 options based on the OPs prompt, so I could assume the same about you regarding ridley. It’s not like we are discussing every villain in history here. And, “The very definition of evil” is essentially “immorality and wickedness”. I don’t know how to make it more obvious to you that mudering anything and everything that isn’t you and seeking to go do the same throughout the cosmos, and taking pleasure in keeping the tormented souls of millions of people at his whim for no reason other than to be cruel to them, is more evil than someone killing people because they can and enjoy it. That’s 1 rung below sephiroth. And by your same logic, ridley’s moral compass is that he can do what he wants / finds fun. Every character can be simplified in that way.

In fact you literally have a painting of Satan as your avatar. Satan is literally the embodiment of evil and Sephiroth is very heavily based on him (one winged angel?) and their motivations are very similar. you think Ridley is more evil than satan? Lol
                Someone who thinks they're the hero of their story, even though they're the villain in others is less evil than someone who is the villain in any story and is cool with that.
                    What? The only difference in that logic, then, is ridley thinking he’s the villain to himself. Sephiroth would not be a hero to anyone as he is in ff7. Except maybe Hojo. But ridley has allies as well, even if they are also shitty (just as hojo is)

If two people randomly killed someone and got interviewed and one says “it seemed fun” and the other says “I did it because all people deserve to die”, to me the latter is worse.
                        Yeah, that's about it.

If someone thinks they're making something better by doing awful things, they're less evil than people who do awful things because it makes everything worse.
                sephiroth is not more evil than ridley. he’s just not
                    Ridley is not more evil than Sephiroth. He’s just not.

See how opinions work? Lol.
                        nobody here agrees with you. it seems that ur just objectively wrong and i’m assuming ur a really big fan of final fantasy 7 and don’t know a whole lot about metroid
                            Or, I just have a different opinion from you lol. I don’t think you know what the word “objectively” means. Also, I could not possibly care any less if people on reddit agreed with me or not on which video game villain is more evil, Im just having fun with the conversation.
                                Keep coping lmao
                                whatever u say bruh
                                    I can almost guarantee you that they are a Sephiroth fanboy who loves the edginess lol

I myself am a fan(girl) of Sephiroth, and I completely disagree with them. I actually have sympathy for him. He was dealt a terrible hand at life to say the least. He straight up went insane.
    Sephey is definitely torturing Cloud for the fun tho
        Even if that’s true, at least it’s just Cloud
            It’s still not good tho
            For now… dude could essentially be immortal.
        Sephy isn’t really the villain of 7, he’s been driven mad and Jenova is the reason he goes crazy. Jenova and Hojo are the real villains of 7.
            Jenova loses most of her autonomy. More of an extension of Sephiroth than her own consciousness.

More or less, Sephiroth assimilated Jenova into himself and his motives are his, influenced by his insanity in learning his true origins.
    You do know that's Kazuya and not Ganondorf in that picture right?
        the question isn't who's the most evil in the picture
My Mii Gunner
    I am scared to ask why.
        Because he's a Mii Gunner. No other reason is necessary. People who play that character only exist to make the game worse for everyone else. That's pretty evil.

I play Mii Gunner because it’s the closest I’ll get to Doomguy in Smash.

We are not the same
                I mean you guys are basically on the same level as puppy killers. When it comes down to it, does the REASON you're a puppy killer make that much of a difference?

        I do have about 30 villagers “working” for me. Some farm, some just breed, others are just stuck in a tiny room with nothing but a book waiting to trade my 10 sticks for the endless amounts of emeralds they have.
I’m glad everyone agrees it’s Ridley no contest.
    I would like to know who is your current father/mother figure
        I have two parents who say they love me but I’m not really sure if they do and a sibling who they say they love equally but I’m not sure if they do.
Yoshi for sure. Tax evasion is inexcusable.
Ridley is just a cruel, evil bastard for the sake of being a cruel, evil bastard. I imagine him sounding like Brad Dourif’s Chucky voice when he talks

Kazuya is up there though. Bro doesn’t bat an eye at attempting to murder his own son and is openly declaring war on humanity in the newest game.
    Now that you’ve said it, I realized how similar Ridley and Chucky are personality-wise, and I’ll never imagine Ridley’s speech as anything else ever again
Ridley. MF killed Samus' parents right in front of her and then ate them. It doesn't get more personal than that. Also Ridley is highly intelligent, he's very aware all the sh*t he does is evil, and he doesn't care. Bro steals, murders, and does heinous experiments without a care in the world.

And like another purple video game villain, he always comes back from death.
    Barney?
    The monster behind the slaughter...
    Waluigi?
    Cooler?
Yo Kazuya compared to others ain’t done shit
    Didn't he cause world war 3
        That was technically Jin. In the newest game he is doing some wild shit
        His son caused ww3 to kill the origin of the devil gene (and failed)
            Ok I don't know my tekken lore I am just aware that ever since Heihachi had kids the world has suffered for it
                Yeah that's about right. Only good one is Lars
                    Even as far as his kids go the only ones who actually liked him are literally 2 bears
                    Reina seems batshit crazy I wouldn’t get hopes up considering her victory cutscenes in Tekken 8 💀
                        Did I just read something I shouldn’t have?
                            No, Reina is just a newcomer in Tekken 8 who is Kazuya’s half-sibling.
                                That’s what I mean, I haven’t seen anything Tekken 8 related story or character wise yet(other than hearing how Kaz sets up the new tournament) cus I haven’t got a chance to get it yet 😂
                                    Lol I see. I mean her trailer is already out, so it’s not really a spoiler or anything
        Nah that was Jin, Kazuya is starting some end of the world shit in T8 as far as I know from the demo but that’s basically the craziest thing he’s done
Ridley ate samus parents
    They were tasty !
Ridley. It's no competetion. He kills for fun and has absolutely no mercy to anything or anyone. He and the space pirates kill lifeforms and planets for fun. Purely sadistic and bloodthirsty
Ridley

Sephiroth isn’t even the most evil character in FF7.
    You’re right. Those frogs are. I hate being turned into a frog for the 8316th time
    Hojo be like
        Hojo is the true monster in FF7, almost every problem in the 7 saga relates to Hojo in  one way or another.
            Too true
    Agreed, I would say Hojo is more evil, even if Sephiroth has committed much more heinous acts. Since Hojo made him that way and was a shit father to him too
So Tekken 8 begins with Kazuya destroying one of many cities and killing anyone there. Then announcing the Tournament with the rule that it's now a death tournament and that not only will the losers be killed but their entire country will be destroyed as well.

Kazuya is the embodiment of that "new management" meme from Megamind. Even Kazuya's devil gene, his literal dark side, isnt as evil as Kazuya is.
    I'm still fascinated about what would happen if somebody with no clear nationality like Armor King dies in the tournament.

Would Kazuya just go "Well fuck I guess I'll wipe out his Mexican friend's country then lmfao".
        Right. Kaz himself renounced his nationality, so if he wins does he just blow up everything?
            At least Kazuya, Heihachi, Yoshimitsu and Kunimitsu **were** Japanese which means that you have a country that is reasonable to blow up.

We just assume that the Armour Kings are mexican because the Kings are Mexican. We don't know what their face looks like which means we can't find out what their race is and just assume their race = their nationality and their skin colour isn't exactly unique to one specific nation.
    How do we make Jin starting WW3 tame by comparison…

Harada: Space lasers…
Least Evil is my GOAT King Dedede. He (recently at least) makes a genuine effort to protect his subjects. Not even sure if he’s a villain anymore since he’s more like a rival to Kirby not unlike Vegeta.  
  
Plus his voice actor is a legend.
    mf LEAST
    I would argue that Bowser is the least evil. He's just trying to be a good parent to Junior and his adopted kids; all he wants is for his kids to grow up with a mom. His methods may not always be moral, but he tries his best to accomplish his goals while causing as little harm to those around him as possible, and he's more than willing to become a hero, even if it doesn't benefit him personally. 

DDD still has bad intentions in mind, but his ways of getting there are tame in comparison to other game antagonists. 

Bowser is a rather complex character, but I'd put him on a fine line between anti-hero and anti-villain (leaning toward anti-hero), whereas DDD is just an anti-villain.
        The last time Dedede had bad intentions was basically just the original Kirby's Dream Land. Events like Revenge of the King and the story mode of Fighters 2 aren't villainous, just antagonistic, since he only wanted to prove himself to Kirby.
        DDD hasn't been a real Villain since 2008, pretty much every game after that (and almost every game before that) he's being Mind controlled or possessed
        Tell me, would someone with bad intentions do this?

https://youtu.be/_O4xvIY3MEE?si=XkAxh7eQ4P9QDySD
            Yes. In fact, it's cliché for game antagonists to sacrifice themselves as a way to redeem themselves or set up plot twists.
At the very least we could sympathise with Sephiroth knowing that everything he believed in was a lie all along. It doesn’t excuse everything he has done, but Sephiroth has been mentally scarred permanently and will never be able to recover, whereas Ridley just wanted to cause pain and suffering from the get go.
Ridley. Hands down. Eats his enemies for fun. No real objectives, just destroy.
    ‘Out of a hundred young men on that ship i was the only survivor. they told my family she was destroyed in battle but i know what i saw - it had no conscience, no reasoning, only destroy.’

william ‘bill’ randa. the quote is about godzilla specifically, but i think it sums up ridley pretty well.
Reminder that, not only did Ridley eat Samus' mom and destroyed her entire colony, but also taunted her by using the voice of her dead mom while fighting her just to fuck with her.

Ridley routinely commits genocides for fun. He doesn't really have a goal beyond inflicting suffering.
mr game & watch
    Hate the player not the game
Alright. While we're all seemingly in agreement it's 100% Ridley, I can't help but notice some people are really saying 'Why is Kazuya here' or 'I thought Kazuya was a good guy', and as someone who's played the Tekken games, let me sum up who exactly Kazuya is.

So before we talk about Kazuya, we need to talk about his parents. You guys all seem familiar with Heihachi, the guy who threw Kazuya off of a cliff as a child, but I dunno how many of you guys know of his mother, Kazumi. To put it simply, she comes from a clan who predicted the Mishimas would cause a great disaster, and she was sent to kill Heihachi. Things didn't pan out and instead Kazumi and Heihachi got married and had a kid. However, Kazumi remembered what she was supposed to do, revealed her true form, Devil Kazumi, and tried to kill Heihachi, only to fail as Heihachi broke her neck. Not only did this give Heihachi a huge paranoia of demons, which is why he threw Kazuya off of that cliff, but it also kinda drove him to look for more power. Kazuya, not only finding out his dad killed his mother, but also for what his dad did to him with the whole cliff thing, is understandably traumatic.

However, despite this making a good enough reason to have beef with Heihachi, he's also in general a menace. Early on, after throwing Heihachi off of a cliff in revenge, he immediately decided he wanted and army of animal super soldiers, and got into animal smuggling. This is where animal activist and possible psychic Jun Kazama came in, who kinda had a 'I can fix him' mentality which so far hasn't worked.

After Tekken 2 where Kaz was dumped into a volcano by his dad, he was out of the series for one game (Which involved a 17 year time skip) while his son became the main focus. One of the first things he does is break into a building, beat the crap out of a bunch of people and threaten to shoot someone. Later on he has his son, who he's basically never met before, chained to a wall as he tortures him.

Tekken 5 shows us a very *brief* glimpse of Kazuya as a child enjoying the company of Jinpachi before Kazuya murders the guy. Tekken 7 has one of the most notable offenses, where Kazuya shoots down a satellite onto a city with the intent on it killing civilians to 'make Heihachi look bad', and just from the preview of Tekken 8 we've seen him threaten to murder bystanders for just existing, host what's basically a last man surviving tournament for his own amusement, and pretty much plan to nuke countries off the face of the planet if their fighter loses

Not to mention the times he's just had random people killed off because they knew something, it's like the reason like 5+ characters personally want to end Kazuya themselves
Bro Ridley kills for fun, and I've heard he literally ate the corpses of Samus' parents and the other people with them (after killing them)
Ridley. He ate Samus’ parents in front of her and would kill anyone just for fun and brag about it
Ridley bc he deadass just kills things for fun and is a straight up menace for sick kicks.
Ridley. He just likes killing for his own amusement.
Ridley. He murders, pillages and ruins everything just for fun.  
Every other character has a motive. Ridley is here for the chaos, it’s not like he’s just a beast who behaves on instinct. He’s smart, resourceful and cunning. He’s a literal psychopath who only does it for fun
Ridley's going to be the main reason they can't make a Metroid movie for kids.
    It’d have to be PG-13 at the lowest but I wouldn’t mind an R-rated Metroid Film
    They could just not give us Samus backstory
Nikocado avocado mii brawler
Ridley ate Samus's parents in front of her because he thought it would be funny.
Ridley and it isn't close.

    Nah, move Dark Pit up a bit.
        He’s not that bad
            He’s allied with Viridi, who wants to destroy humanity. He’s at least worse than Meta Knight.
    Never knew Wolf was a bad guy.. then again, I don’t know much about Star Fox lore
        Yeah, he's a mercenary hired by Andross (the real big bad) to kill you at certain points in Star Fox 64.
            Damn, that’s wild. I always thought he seemed like an anti-hero, rival to fox kinda dude.
    I feel like Robin should be up here, especially since smash bros robin has grima inside of him
        Robin himself goes below even Dark Pit, Grima goes somewhere in the top four (above Sephiroth, but anything above him is debatable).
Mario
    But hey that’s just a theory
    😂 definitely
Villager because capitalism
    Villager is more a victim of capitalism than anything else. Tom Nook is the true villain here.
        He gives you a home, don't make you pay more than you should (unlike every single banks) and don't care about how long you take, Tom is a good guy
from what I have seen Kazuya is just an asshole
Kirby. Motherfucker killed GODS because they took away Kirbys fucking cookie or something. Evil shit.
    TBF though, Dark Nebula gas to be the least godly of all of the villains Kirby ever fought. I don't think he's a good representation of the sheer wackery that goes on in the Kirby universe.
Are we gonna forget that ganondorf in the newest game (totk) committed several counts of murder and then genocide
    Exactly, why isn't he in this debate?
Ridley
Ridley probably. He regularly kills just because he feels like it, he leads the space pirates which are responsible for toms of unethical and illegal experiments on life forms. Most villains just kill but Ridley and the pirates actively torture stuff with their experiments, that's puts them on another level than most imo
Sephiroth is literal spawn of satan, hates everything and seeks to destroy all life. Ridley has committed genocides, Sephiroth sought to commit omnicide. Ridley does stuff just for fun, but to Sephiroth, *everything* is personal. 

Sure Ridley is chaotic evil, but Sephiroth is in his own brand. 

*“Tell me what you cherish most… give me the pleasure of taking it away.”* —Sephiroth to Cloud, Advent Children
    Well said lol. But get ready for the reddit groupthink downvote bukkake lmao.
        That’s quite a way to phrase it, but I’m just being honest when I say that I really don’t think that most understand just how evil Sephiroth really is
            I think he just went mad due to the whole Jenova thing. He burns down one village but doesnt manage to do much else in the end.
                It wasn’t just Sephiroth finding out what he really was, as he was always a monster on the battlefield. Whatever Shinra commanded him to eradicate, he did. Sephiroth isn’t just the guy who burned down Nibelheim and killed Cloud’s mother, Sephiroth is the being that was made to bring forth the end of existence and space as known to all manners of life.
                    Idk if burning down a village and wanting to destroy the world is exceptionally evil, thats like every single jrpg bad guy.
                        Sephiroth doesn’t just want to destroy the world, he wants to erase life itself and replace it with something of his own.
Meta knight & Bayonetta for both being too OP
Steve.
Kirby.
Ridley in that trio though, Smash in general though would definitely be Ganon
    No, not really. Ganon has a few counts of kidnapping and murder, along with leading and organizing a large paramilitary organization. Genocide too, if you count the newer games. Ridley has all that, along with multiple confirmed counts of mass genocide, aggravated robbery (an EXTREME simplification of what he's done), every type of assault under the sun except maybe sexual (I wouldn't put it past him, though), more human rights violations than there are humans and cannibalism, which I guess wouldn't apply since he's not human. All that and I'm pretty sure I haven't even scratched the
The wifi router of whoever the fuck I just played in elite smash
Steve. That fucking eco-terrorist
It’s Sephiroth, Ridley or Ganondorf for sure
    Oh most definitely. Let’s see we got a man who has tried to destroy a planet, a creature that has raided countless numbers of worlds, and a man who has committed Genocide or has tried to commit Genocide numerous times
kazuya is quite literally a devil and does everything he does because hes selfish
GannonDorf or Ridley cause their evil incarnate kazuya and Sephiroth were both victims
What about Ganondorf, he has basically been reincarnated so many times and has always been evil in each lifetime he lives.
Pichu
ganondorf
Ridley is definitely number 1 and though he isn't a playable character, Metal Face is a nice number 2 as he is a master at cutting through things like a hot knife through butter
Seph
King Dedede stole all the food in the kingdom, doesn't get much more evil than that
Kirby

![gif](giphy|NOalcASHiOGvC)
Isabelle
Ironically, I think it's Dark Samus (it's ironic because you didn't show it in the post). Like the top comment said about Ridley, Dark Samus has no excuse for being evil. But while Ridley's maniacal and wants to crush the Galactic Federation and disturb the galaxy's peace (which Mother Brain was also part of), Dark Samus was calculated and took control of a living planet to spread Phazon across the universe and rule everything. There was no cure for Phazon, only the P.E.D. suits, which were risky to use, and the only person besides some Federation soldiers to survive while using one was Samus. Not to mention that Dark Samus also brought the Space pirates to their knees, forcing them to follow its command- including Ridley.

I don't think any villain in Smash Bros compares to how evil Dark Samus is.
Duck hunt because he hunt ducks. And Ducks are cool.
Tabuu
Ridley, he takes pleasure from Samus' trauma, and he takes pleasure from simply killing
Ah yes

Xenomorph, loki, and morbius
We are about to find out how Kazuya at his worst will be.
Kirby. Battery, destroying planets and gods, destruction of property, endangerment of near extinct animals, slavery.
    Nah bro. Kirby will not attack unless Planet Popstar or his friends are threatened. He just wants to sleep, chill and eat cake.
I never played Metroid, but I don't think Ridley tops Ganondorf he is literally the Incarnate of evil and starts wars on multiple dimensions killing tons of people, causing such a degree of destruction that the goddesses and other deities have to step in to stop it. This man was so bad they needed time travel and the power of the triforce, and they still can't stop him from coming back. 

Between the two chaotic evil and lawful evil, they are both willing to kill for the sake of killing, experiment on people, and eradicate peoples.

While Ganon seems to centralize on just the planet Hyrule is on, and Ridley causes havoc galaxy wide, Ganon's plan will destroy realities, and he is actively trying to do it.
King Dedede. He stole all of the food in Dream Land.
Kazuya is so over-the-top and cartoonishly evil that I can’t help but love him.
    Kazuya, just from the trailers alone, has straight up become a DBZ villain at this point
Sephiroth was a good guy before he went insane, and then he went insane and he burned villages to the ground, but he was doing all it out of a demented love for his “mother”

Granted, most of what I know of Kazuya is from others since I’ve never played tekken, but he was emotionally and physically abused by his father, and even then, aren’t there times where he had to fight a greater evil with the good guys(I swear I heard that somewhere) let me know if I got any lore wrong

Ridley is just a complete psychopath, he kills and destroys villages, civilizations, and worlds just for fun. He has no end goal, he just does what he does because he loves doing it. He gave Samus PTSD after tauntingly eating her parents in front of her because he thought it was funny.

It’s Ridley, he’s more evil than most villains in gaming.
    The only time Kazuya ever sided with anyone but himself was during tekken 5 when he and heihachi briefly fought off a horde of robots together before kazuya backstabbing heihachi by throwing him into some suicide bombers. He never plays with the heroes outside of non-canon appearances.

His abuse as a child to adult from his bastard father doesn't excuse the fact he's a corporate warmonger facilitating world war 3 in present time, blowing up cities and firing lasers on civilians, shooting out the earth's satellites to rain them on the planet like meteors, and hosting a blood tournament where the punishment for losing is both your death and the destruction of your home country. He's also extra guilty of mentally and physically torturing/beating his own son too
my buddy eric
    oh yeah I remember him being evil af on a field trip back in '95
Sephiroth for all the countless games I lost thanks to him
Sephiroth Wins For Me
Everyone  saying Ridley cause he "Kills for fun" is weak. Sephiroth literally brings Cloud despair in ANY universe/world/reality that he winds up in. Killed off a MAIN/PLAYABLE character (Samus parents who??) and wants to ride a Jenova comet into every planet in the galaxy for COSMIC CONQUEST. The dude can create a SUPER NOVA and his theme song shits on Ridley alone, gtfo with this.
    My guy, the question is not who is more powerful, cause it's pretty obvious that's Sephiroth. It's who's more evil, and "murders for fun" is just one part of what Ridley has done. He commits robbery, genocide, and gluttony on a massive scale. 

The thing that truly sets him apart really are the horrific mengele-esque experiments he runs on various lifeforms including his own subjects. He exposes them to Radiation, Phazon and other chemicals just to see what would happen, with 0 remorse to what happens to them. Even his own men.
        Power wasn't my objective at all, but I see your point. However, this argument comes down to what we define "Evil" by. What you explained is bad for sure, but you all admit he does it for "fun" with no remorse. Sephiroth is Evil with "purpose" and puts malice in every word he speaks. He loathes what he sees before him and is driven to destroy every living thing on his planet, and beyond because they are beneath him. Experiments and torture are evil, but Ridley also has pirates doing his dirty work for him. Sephiroth wants to eliminate every living thing by his own hand, not play with them. He is the absolute end to the universe if he's  not stopped. I see as a "Pure Evil" (Seph) vs a "Chaotic Evil" (Rid) imo.
        I only mentioned Super Nova because people mention "genocide, and mass killing". How is a super nova not all of that and more.
Clearly DDD
ridley. taunts samus about killing and eating her parents

    Why Bowser?
Bowser
Kazuya is def the most evil one with human intelligence.
    Ridley is smarter than most humans
Kirby
I would say Kirby: this mf literally destroyed an entire planet and tormented King Dedede simply because he got his food stolen. Truly a menace for society
    Not really accurate. Kirby didn't just get his personal food stolen. Dedede stole the entire Planet's food supply, everyone on Planet Popstar would have starved if he didn't get it back from him.
Villager
Kirby
Ridley. Not even a contest.
I know his feats aren’t as bad but Wario is such a little shit
Ridley is a sadistic mf that terrorizes planets and slaughters innocent people for the pure fun of it, and relishes in the pain and suffering of others.

He's easily worse than every other villain on the roster, and it's not even close.
Ridley is the ultimate chaotic evil
Jigglypuff

Kazuya for his evil armor.
Didn’t Ridley kill Samus’ parents in cold blood? Twice?

Why do this Pic go hard
Ganondorf/Ganon/Demise
Villager

He scares me
King K Rool
Ridley, they are legit referred to as the God of DEATH sometimes.

Also he makes it clear that he just does it for funzies.
Sephiroth not only murdered a ton of people, be was trying to destroy the entire planet.
Ridley did eat Samus' parents in front of her and mocked her for it
Ness, when your doing the genocide route
that one mii fighter based off someon i shouldnt have
How is Sephiroth not being mentioned more? Sephiroth brought down a meteor and killed millions of people, and decimated the world’s infrastructure. He infected children to resurrect himself, and planned to hollow out the Earth and ride into the rest of the galaxies to kill everything he came across. Sephiroth planned an Intergalactic genocide for literally no reason. He’s sadistic to Cloud for no reason. Sure, he was lied to about his birth and his parents, but that happens all the time in real life and you don’t see them becoming space hitlers
Aerith's death traumatized me as a child
Tabuu.
How is Ridley more evil than ganondorf
Sephiroth is Sephiroth

Kazuya may have killed his father and started WW3

Ridley genocides and eats people for fun

Ganondorf is called the Great King of Evil for a reason

Dark Pit is just an evil clone

Bowser is a silly dragon turtle

Bowser Jr is a little shithead who needs the belt

Dedede is the silliest guy

Meta Knight wants people to stop being lazy

K. Rool tried to nuke DK Island and take over the world and torments a family of apes over bananas

Wolf is part of a mercenary group
By far Sephiroth
Sometimes I forget Ridley isn’t just some mindless monster and is in fact a fully sentient, free thinking, *leader* of the space pirates who actively chooses to murder countless people for fun
People don’t realize how evil dark Samus is. Took 3 games to take her down and she just corrupts entire planets and throws countless meteors at many many planets. Took over the entire space pirate army and killed anyone who questioned her. Even Ridley feared her.
Ridley. No competition. Kazuya is the way he is because his family is terrible, and Seph has lived a rough and tragic past, including him realizing that everything he believed in was proven to be bullshit. Ridley never had such burdens, he just plans and causes atrocities purely for wealth and fun.

Even Dark Samus has the debatably more ambitious motives of conquering the universe with Phazon. Ridley may be reaching for similar goals with the Metroids, but he ultimately amounts to Mother Brain's chief assassin: he is in it purely for the blood. Let's not forget the one time he was in full charge in Metroid Prime - god knows how many of his pirates got fucked up by his Phazon operations
Sephiroth was never even a bad guy. He was lied to, manipulated, experimented on, and cast aside by Shinra when they were done using him.
I mean, sephiroth destroyed the entire galaxy.
Kirby be going on routine slaughterfest just because dedede stole his food. I think Kirby evil af.
Those with bad internet playing online
Ganondorf is pretty goddamn evil. He's called The King of Evil after all.
Dark Samus (AKA Metroid Prime) is pretty pure fucking evil. It has no redeemable qualities that could ever be admirable or good. Some of these other villains have standards or some kind of humanity or soft spot. MP is just a force of pure corruption and domination.
Ridley, Kazuya’s just a  power hungry character with daddy issue while Sephiroth is an edgelord with mommy issues, whereas Ridley is just pure evil in how they act and think, Ganondorf is also pretty bad considering he doesn’t mind harming children but he’s not as sadistic as Ridley is
The one that looks like Phoenix Wright
Bowser. That piano-solo was diabolical!
It’s gotta be Ridley and Dark Samus. At least with Sephiroth and Kazuya you can feel some sympathy for.
Isabelle
I thought kazuya was a good guy
    Please check out the intro to Tekken 8's story mode where he shoots a death laser on innocent civilians then shoots out every single satellite out of orbit so they simultaneously crash onto the planet like meteors causing indescribable mayhem, then declares world war 3, and finally announces a death tournament where he'll blow up entire countries if their respective fighters lose.
The man is just Satan, I'm surprised that wasn't apparent by now
Metalface
Sephiroth for sure
Steve

The things you can do in a sandbox game....

^(fr tho its ridley no contest)
Cannonically Gannon.  The King of Evil
Bowser may be goofy but that doesn’t make him less evil. He will literally do anything to kidnap Princess Peach. He’d even destroy entire inhabited planets just for one selfish goal.

They also call him Killager for a reason…
Frying bacon right in someone’s face as they’re trying to survive hanging from a ledge is pretty sinister IMO
Obviously K. Rool. Only a real monster would plot to steal another man’s entire banana hoard.
Wolf. He works for a Terrorist organization, and I just wanted a Valid excuse to talk about him.
Kazuya is litteraly called the devil in tekken. He doesn't have the feats of the others but is canonically the most evil by reference(he has the devil gene so it's not just a name).
    For the people who are talking about riddly eating samus' parents, kaz did that but with his own son and father.
Didnt sephiroth destroy Jupiter i know no one lives there but thats probably worse than what the other two have done
Ridley
K Rool. The number of bananas he steals has no place in society
Yoshi
Ridley, people loved to act like Sephiroth was Smash getting its first 'real' bad guy, but Sephiroth at least thinks he's justified to himself. Ridley knows he's a complete monster and greatly enjoys it, the guy eats people's families infront of them whilst laughing.
Ridley is downright ruthless, in game lore and in the manga, not only does he commit genocide and eat the flesh of his victims he jokes about it to a girl he orphaned and about her parents he ate.
Ridley.

Not even a competition.

Sephiroth was manipulated by JENOVA, and was driven insane as he started being controlled by her.

Ganon is kinda just a force of nature at this point, and that’s just how he is.

Ridley? Ridley specifically pillages and slaughters entire planets while taking everything of value. Ridley tortures and plays with his victims before killing them. Ridley had just destroyed Samus’ entire colony, when she was 3 years old and didn’t understand what was happening, and tried to appear like he was going to help her right before eating her (he was stopped ofc.). Ridley absolutely deserves the title “Cunning God of Death.”
Steve
Yoshi, he commits tax fraud
Steve
I’d give Sephiroth a half pass because he kinda went bad-shit CRAZY
Kirby! He's been terrorizing the good people of dreamland since 1999
Ganondorf is a pure evil incarnate. He is the demon king
Pikachu
Could it be Dark Samus because Phazon?
Ridley is so evil, it's comedic. He's the type to litter, not because it's convenient, but simply because it's wrong.
Dedede stole Forty cakes! That's as many as four tens! And that's terrible
Isabelle. — No I will not explain myself it should be obvious.
Sep hit the world with a meteor…
Did the other two do anything remotely close?
Kirby
Chudat playing Kirby in Project M
Kirby
Probably Ridley, Kazuya and Sephiroth both have morals reasons and are people that in the end have feelings and can care about stuff, Ridley is legit just evil and kills and most likely doesn’t “feel” like a person could.
Ridley. 

Going down the list of playable villains, and IMO; 

Meta knight is the least evil. He decided to be the bad guy exactly once, aiming to force the inhabitants of his planet to learn self-defense in case kirby ever fails, and kirby beat that plan out of him anyway. 

 King dedede is the second least evil. He started off bad enough, but quickly became just a guy doing the wrong things for the right reasons, and is currently both a hero in his own right and a legitimately good ruler. 

Bowser Jr. is the 3rd least evil. All the acts of villainy are essentially just a game to him, and all learned from his father. He’s also fully capable of noticing when things have gone too far, and is not above asking the heroes to fix it when they have. 

Dark pit, to my knowledge, is the 4th least evil. Pit’s so pure-hearted that his evil counterpart is manly just kinda mean and aggressive, rather than actually evil. 

Dark samus is the 5th least evil. All she thinks or cares about is spreading and consuming phazon, with little brainpower dedicated to anything else. 

Piranha plant is next up on the list. They’re essentially just animal predators, though the one in smash is notable for being a bit more sadistic than is normal for his species. 

Wario is a bit worse. All he cares about is making money and messing with mario. He doesn’t care about doing anything actively evil; just actively profitable, and will be a legitimately nice guy as long as he knows he profits from being one. The only thing that can distract him from his love of money is annoying mario. Not even actively killing or hurting him; just inconveniencing him is enough. 

Bowser is next. He’s mostly amicable; he’s just also an incel who does not understand the word “no”, at least regarding marriage. As long as it doesn’t involve that, or his carefully cultivated reputation of being the biggest, baddest guy around, he’s practically a sweetheart. 

King K. Rool is where we get into the territory of “would be outright vile, even outside of fiction”. He REALLY wants to kill the kongs. 

Kazuya’s next up, and 5th place on the evil list, with a sadistic streak, a willingness to commit murder, and a soft spot for patricide. 

Then i’ve got sephiroth, just barely missing the podium. Genocidal, insane, and full of rage, his insanity is what keeps him off said podium; he’s not really sound of mind enough to be intentionally a monster, and was… definitely not a good person, but certainly a lot less evil before he went crazy. 

For the bronze, i’d place wolf O’Donnel. He’s a bounty hunter and a sadist, who prefers to play with his food before killing it, and rather enjoys the killing part. He’s not as vile as another member of star wolf, leon, but makes no real effort to rein in that sicko either. He’s willing to work with the good guys to save his skin, his wallet, and/or his reputation as bounty hunters and not criminals with bounties, but prefers to work for the baddies anyway. 

Second place is ganondorf. The great king of evil, whose hatred is so great that it can literally be concentrated into a physical form that is itself nearly always evil. Thing is, most of his evilest deeds are for some personal benefit or out of spite, rather than to get his jollies off from causing suffering. He’s also literally born to be evil due to demise’s curse, so some of that cruelty isn’t even entirely his fault. He was robbed of the chance to be anything but absolutely vile before he entered the cradle, and even then, he could still be SO much worse .

And at number 1, ridley. He’s got a sadistic streak a mile long, likes to tailor his insults to whomever he’s insulting to maximize psychological damage, and is at least somewhat of a racist (as he refuses to learn any language but his native one because he sees himself as superior). He kills people for fun, eats people for fun, and makes jokes about the people he’s eaten exclusively to torment those close to the people he’s eaten.
    Did you just forget ganondorf?
        Yep. Fixing.
            Wasn’t trying to be like “ackshually” I just wanted to see your take on the king of evil lol

Ridley is a sick fucker
It's just Ridley. I wish I had a joke or argument, but it's Ridley.

Isn't Ganon supposed to be like pure evil or something?
Steve
Duck hunt. That laugh taunted me for a long time
Ganondorf
i gotta say Ridley

for everything he put Samus through and how he just kills everything he can
Kirby
Ridley just for the reason I haven't played ff or tekken and do not plan to (I mean maybe tekken but it's probably really hard)
Ain't Ganondorf the embodiment of evil itself?
Di-….didn’t Ridley… ate… Samus’ parents?….. Or at least her mother?….. Like yeah, Sephiroth and Kazuya are straight up evil but their crimes compared to Ridley’s are the equivalent of a freaking tea party….
Sephiroth and Kazuya atleast has an excuse of being traumatized by their origins or family. Ridley is just fucking psychopath by nature.
Honestly, outside the lores of other game characters, Tabuu is the Evilest Character in Super Smash Bros, with Darkon and Galeem coming in at a very close second.
I could take them all
I’m confused why Kazuya is even on this list? I thought Kazuya was the main character of at least one of the Tekken games, and his father Hyachi was the villain.
    Kazuya, the same guy who was known for genetic testing on Humans and animals, the same guy who shot down a satellite onto a populated town on purpose, the same guy who's organising a fight to the death for the best fighter of every country to decide who he's going to nuke next
        Point taken
    Kazuya is no better, and Heihachi is already dead. even then, their beef was basically just deciding which one of them would continue a tyrannical rule over the world. Kazuya's son, Jin, is the actual main character you're looking for
Ridley and Sephiroth
Kirby
Me, bitch
pikachu mains
Wario
Ice climbers fuck that character
Ridley 100% it's no contest!
Not sure I'd even call Kazyua a villain. An antagonist sure, villain? Probably Ripley or Ganondorf
I mean Sephiroth did canonically blow up the earth's solar system just so debris would hit people in FF7
Pyra-Mythra. That OP spam character never fails to mess up my GSP.
Ridley is a complete Psychophat that finds pleasure form the pain, suffer and death he creates. He´s first action when child Samus tried to give him a flower was trying to kill her, and he takes personal the fact that she survived. So yeah Ridley.
Bowser Jr
Either Ridley or Dark Samus
isn’t ganondorf the literal incarnation of evil
Don’t they call Ridley the God of Death or something??
    The Cunning God of Death
        Right it was that. What a fitting name…
        I just call him the Cunt, for shorts.
            Remember kids call men cunts and women cuntettes
            Holy Shit, that was funny. Thank you for the good laugh
Sephy's been driven insane, Kazuya is now willfully evil after influence but can be restrained. 

Ridley is an actual fucking serial killer that eats parents in front of their children.
    Yeah and caused samus to become orphaned(which causes her to have PTSD of Ridley and she also obtains her power suit
What in god’s name is Kazuya’s excuse? Parental negligence? He met more than enough people across the world to know that not everyone is as bad as Heihachi. My guy is just a bonafide rat bastard of a man, actively enjoying making others suffer, justifying his actions with social darwinism, and in Tekken 8(spoilers);

    So, Ridley's that but on a Galactic level.
        Yeah, afaik kazoo didn’t EAT anyone

Yet…
    Child abuse and devil gene. Don't make for the best combo for a well mentally balanced and emotionally stable adult.
    His dad threw him down a cliff when he was a kid…
        Yeah, and he did it back to him. Twice over. Do me a favour and don’t try to defend the genocidal maniac, this isn’t AOT
            It wasn’t defending them so much as pointing out that had things been different for them growing up they could have been potentially good people.

Ridley on the other hand is just naturally evil/ruthless, in every incarnation, even from birth and when shown affection
                Naturally evil ≠ most evil. I would argue that ganon or (to a much smaller extent) bowser are the most evil villains because their goals don’t stop. Ganon has a hatred that keeps him coming back throughout time in Zelda just to conquer hyrule but ultimately fails each time just to revive because of his hatred of the hero. Bowser goes about it wrong usually but he’s usually about world/galactic domination and kidnapping peach, while this usually ends up with bowser defeated (and there are games where bowser temporarily teams up with Mario) he always comes back with a bigger(possibly better) plan to rule the mushroom kingdom or galaxy depending on the game. Ridley being born sadistic isn’t evil it’s just what he was born as. It takes someone who was once good to do the worst evils imo and while ganon and bowser aren’t exactly the most evil I don’t think Ridley is all that evil either like he’s a bad creature but he’s not as evil as the games make him out he’s just a sadistic monster who hates people or something. I can’t speak to kazuya or sephiroth’s character so I’ll leave it at that
    Good point. 

Ridely did destroys planets for fun and enjoys torturing others. He also has no history of mental abuse or similar. 

Ridely also doesn't wash his hands after using the restroom.
        That sick monster!

HOW CAN YOU NOT WASH YOUR HANDS?!
    To be fair, sephiroth had a psychological breakdown after learning he had been lied to his entire life about his family. His attempt to destroy the planet only came close to working because of how powerful he just happened to be when he had the meltdown.

* Ridley
            Ridley is a mutated Dalek confirmed?
                He's a xenolek
                    Well, now I'm imagining a tiny Dalek bursting out of someone's chest. Which would admittedly be horrifying as you'd hear a muffled "exterminate" followed by a muffled to not muffled "Ex...ter...mi...." ~explodes out of chest~ "nate"!

Edit: and the whole time of course the guy is screaming his head off while his chest begins glowing brighter and brighter blue.
                        Lol I imagine it would be like a Russian doll where the guy bursts out of the dalek and the xeno bursts out the guy
                I don't know much about Doctor Who but I thought all Daleks were mutated, then genetically modified and turned into cyborgs?


If so Ridley is basically what they could achieve if they weren't mutated.
                    They're not Cyborgs. They're a lifeform that are encased in a battle armor. A mutated Dalek is not a Dalek because it would be deemed imperfect. Daleks are in their eyes the superior lifeform and nothing else is worthy of life.

Pure hatred for anything other than Dalek. They were created through genetic modification but once Dalek they approve of nothing else.

The Daleks were once forced to be recreated by genetically modifying human DNA and their own technology didn't recognize them as Dalek so they had to trick the Doctor into confirming they were Dalek so they could create pure Daleks again.

As soon as the new pure Daleks were created they forced the impure ones to self destruct because they were not Dalek.
                        Thanks for the lore. Always love me some lore.
                            Heck yeah, lore is life.
            I would genuinely believe he said this in the manga
            If that’s his thoughts then he’s not so evil he just doesn’t think of us as equals I mean if you tallied up all the mosquitoes you’ve killed and it’s like 10,000 or something your not evil but if Ridley does his version of that it’s a war crime for killing 10,000 humans.
        He puts em six feet under, got ‘em sleepin with the fishes, takes ‘em for a ride, gives ‘em acid bath, buy ‘em some cement shoes, get ‘em fitted for a coffin,  drives ‘em to the farm upstate, puts ‘em down, put ‘em to bed, makes ‘em see the pearly gates, they’ll be pushing up daisies, snuffed, croaked, un-alived, he’ll give ‘em suicide assistance, a real dirt nap, the big sleep, fill ‘em fulla lead, really let ‘em have it…

… and he’ll kill ‘em too!
    Murder, kill... it's ultimately meaningless when the end result is all the same.
    Doesn't the term "murder" only apply if the killer and the killed are of the same species? I don't think Ridley is that particilar with his killing.
        No, it refers to the intentional killing of a human by another human.

But that's only because humans are the only animals we know we a similar intelligence.

So one could extend it to a person killing another person if you could find non-human persons.
    Murder only applies to humans
        and crows...
    Murder refers to the killing of humans.

You could extend it to other beings with a level of sentience complex enough to be called "a person", but still limited to killing people.

Ridley kills everything, not just people, and so it isn't murder.
        Its murder. Stop.
    "It wasn't"murder" your Honour, my client was merely ending lifeforms. Helping nature in its cycle.
His rant to Samus in the Zero Mission manga about how disgusting her dad tasted is the stuff of legends.
    True, it comes off as so petty. I feel like the only Nintendo villains pettier than him are the  two dream spirits from Kirby, Nightmare and Elfilis. Both of them were willing to crash two planetary bodies together just to take out Kirby (though tbf it's only in the anime for Nightmare, and I can probably find way more examples of  pettiness from all of the villains in there). PS, it was Samus' mother that was eaten, iirc her dad blew himself up with all of the space pirates when he was guarding a cargo ship.
You do realize Ridley started the entire series right(samus only got her power suit because Ridley killed her parents
    Does that somehow make him less evil?
        No I don’t think so
            Samus even has PTSD of Ridley (shown in other m and Ridley’s reveal trailer)
                Do you have a point you're making here or did you just word your comment weirdly as if you did? I'm not sure what you're trying to say here.
                That other m PTSD thing is stupid and you know it. Also I’m pretty sure the reveal trailer was just her being caught off guard considering it ends with her going straight for him.
    Twice, mind you 

He waited for her to get adopted and then killed her new parents
Sephiroth literally tried to do the same
    Key word tried, I love FF7 but Ridley has killed multiple planets worth of creatures. If by any chance sephiroth won he probably would have traveled the galaxy consuming other planets, but he never made it that far
        Also Sephiroth did it out of some obsession for Jevona and a messiah complex where Ridley did it multiple time just because he could
            And depending on how canon you consider the Manga to be, he also killed and ate Samus' parents in front of her knowing they were related to her.
        I mean yeah, but this is in regards to how evil they are, and they were both determined to do the same thing just for the sake of it, it’s just one managed to succeed, but they’re both just as evil. Also the answer for this is technically like Galeem/Dharkon no?
            If intent matters then so does reason, no?

If Sephiroth does it for his mother (or something) and Ridley does it for entertainment and sadistic pleasure then Ridley takes the medal?
    His goal wasn't just to hurt and kill, it was to gain power, and eventually to create a new world. He was indifferent to the pain he caused, but it wasn't his goal... except Cloud, he loved fucking with Cloud.
God forbid people have fun. 🙄
So does Kirby
he impaled mario and megaman with no hesitation
How are you going to put two humans (or at least appearing as human) against someone who's literally just a giant dragon monster, there was no winning for them
Ridley straight up said to Samus that their parents were protein bars to him.
    Sephiroth killed clouds mom completely unnecessarily on his way out of burning down his home town because he felt like it, and forces cloud to relive the moment at random through induced hallucinations, just to torment him lol.
        Ridley killed samus's parents in front of her, and years later after he found out that she had foster parents, he killed them in front of her too
            If I remember correctly, he ate the bodies after for his own survival
                Yeah and literally sent samus into a fucking PTSD driven shock where she literally begged for someone to kill her because she thought ridley's murder of the whole planet was inevitable
                    We don't talk about Other M.
        And killed his friend aerith in front of him, and his party
    They *might have been. He didn’t actually discern whether or not it was her parents because he didn’t care enough to make note of who he was eating.
I dunno.. Sephiroth basically sees people as ants in the way. And he wants to exterminate them all so he can use the earth as a ship to explore space. I feel like that’s more evil than a deranged space pirate killing for fun.
    Sephiroth has a motive, a strange one, a motive nonetheless

Ridley is just in it for fun, I doubt he even cares about the whole pirate part of his job and just uses it to kill
        I don’t really follow that logic. It’s like saying a dictator who commits genocide because he thinks his people are superior is less evil than a thrill seeking serial killer. Someone who kills for fun is just fucked in the head. Someone who is actually coherent and justifies their actions is way more evil imo.
            After he meets MB, he does become contractually obligated to have a motive, which is forcing the galaxy into “peace” by killing everyone who disagrees with them, most notably, the Galactic Federation
            i think you forgot that the thrill serial killer has a higher body count than the dictator
                Body count isnt really relevant. We’re talking about fundamental personality. By your logic, Ridley is more evil than Frieza from Dragonball because he just kills for fun, but Frieza has murdered trillions.
            I don’t know why this is getting downvoted, makes sense to me
                Because it apparently feels good to downvote benign video game opinions you don’t agree with lmao.
                    Isn't disagreeing like... the point of downvotes?
                        Not really. It’s to block out misinformation / hate, unrelated / off-topic discussion, etc. gives the person bad karma and prevents the spread of their post. After a certain number the post gets hidden, etc. If you disagree with someone’s benign opinion you talk about it with them. It’s just that it’s really easy to just downvote so it has become a tool to pile-on, but thats not what it’s really for.

The official word on the purpose of downvotes from Reddit themselves: 

>Vote. If you think something contributes to conversation, upvote it. If you think it does not contribute to the subreddit it is posted in or is off-topic in a particular community, downvote it.

So if someone asks “which villain is the most evil?”, and I say A and you say B, we can talk about it.. no one needs to dowvote because its all on topic lol. If I came in and say “Toyota’s are fantastic cars” then the purpose of a downvote is to hide unrelated posts or offensive posts etc. but people feel better about themselves when they do it apparently. I almost never downvote vote because off topic / offensive stuff is almost always already gone by the time I get in threads.
                            I mean, you downvoted literally every opinion I made that disagreed with you lol. So I assumed you were saying you disagreed with me in those situations.
                                Oof doesn't look great to be sanctimonious about downvotes but still use them like everyone else 💀 sucks for him I guess
                                I did it because everyone was doing it to me lol. So I should correct that, I only senselessly downvote when it’s senselessly done to my on-topic post. Have you seen all my posts on here? I assumed you were doing it to mine. Lol
                            Maybe that's the intended use, but the social climate dictates that's just how it be. Not everyone is gonna want to have a civilised discussion, or has the time, so the downvote becomes a good way to express agreement or disagreement with a comment
                                Im just answering the question you asked.
            Well the thing is that Ridley is part of the space pirates, who in Prime 3 essentially have attempted to genocide entire planets to turn them into fuel for their weapons.
                Okay? I don’t see how that changes anything. If anything that just gives him a motivation, but one less interesting but one none-the-less.
    Having a motive for killing is less “evil” than doing it for the lol’s. 

One wouldn’t kill without the motive, it’s just something they have to do to accomplish their goals. The other one literally derives pleasure from the act of evil.
        I disagree with that. In fact, BECAUSE they have a motive many of the motivated villains derive pleasure from killing as well. If not more. Sephiroth DEFINITELY enjoys killing people, for example. I said it in another reply but I’ll repeat here: a dictator who kills people because he believes his people are better then everyone else is far more evil, and also takes delight in killing, versus someone who just takes delight in killing. I fail to see how the latter is worse thn someone who knows fully well its wrong, enjoys it, AND thinks it’s righteous to do.
            Yes, they think it’s righteous to do so, which means they **do not believe** what they are doing is evil. These people would not kill without motive. 

The person who kills for fun knows what they’re doing is wrong and **does not care**. That is literally the definition of evil. They revel in their wickedness and amorality.
                It doesnt matter if they would kill with or without motive if the motive is that everyone but them should be dead lmao.
                    Yes, but the key difference is **both** of these villains want everyone dead. Except one thinks it’s right, the other knows it’s wrong and LIKES that. 

That is empirically, literally, more evil by definition. Profoundly immoral and wicked. 

Sephiroth is less evil than Ridley. But that’s a good thing, because he has more depth as a character.
                        It doesn’t make a difference to me. Especially since Sephiroth very clearly also enjoys it. He’s like ridley but with his actions being righteous added on top of it. He literally wields a cloud of tormented souls that he wont let pass on to the afterlife. He’s not just on a crusade, he’s also sadistic. He didn’t have to kill aerith, he didnt have to kill clouds mom, or pretty much anyone else he killed. He just wanted to, and revels in it.
                            Yes, Sephiroth revels in it because he believes it is his divine right. He believes he is exacting moral, righteous vengeance against the people who genocided his ancestors. He’s like the Doom Slayer, who takes pleasure in murdering demons because he believes all of them are evil. They both view their killing and torture as justified and it’s strictly a matter of perspective. 

That is not more evil than someone killing because “fuck yeah evil.” I just like murder, hoo rah. 

Like I don’t know how to make it any more obvious lol. You’re arguing against the very definition of what evil is. At this point I can only assume you’re a big fan of Sephiroth so you **want** him to be the most evil in this situation but you’re actively advocating for Sephiroth to be way edgier and lamer than he actually is.
                                You can assume whatever you want, but it’s just a difference of opinion, and we have 3 options based on the OPs prompt, so I could assume the same about you regarding ridley. It’s not like we are discussing every villain in history here. And, “The very definition of evil” is essentially “immorality and wickedness”. I don’t know how to make it more obvious to you that mudering anything and everything that isn’t you and seeking to go do the same throughout the cosmos, and taking pleasure in keeping the tormented souls of millions of people at his whim for no reason other than to be cruel to them, is more evil than someone killing people because they can and enjoy it. That’s 1 rung below sephiroth. And by your same logic, ridley’s moral compass is that he can do what he wants / finds fun. Every character can be simplified in that way.

In fact you literally have a painting of Satan as your avatar. Satan is literally the embodiment of evil and Sephiroth is very heavily based on him (one winged angel?) and their motivations are very similar. you think Ridley is more evil than satan? Lol
            Someone who thinks they're the hero of their story, even though they're the villain in others is less evil than someone who is the villain in any story and is cool with that.
                What? The only difference in that logic, then, is ridley thinking he’s the villain to himself. Sephiroth would not be a hero to anyone as he is in ff7. Except maybe Hojo. But ridley has allies as well, even if they are also shitty (just as hojo is)

If two people randomly killed someone and got interviewed and one says “it seemed fun” and the other says “I did it because all people deserve to die”, to me the latter is worse.
                    Yeah, that's about it.

If someone thinks they're making something better by doing awful things, they're less evil than people who do awful things because it makes everything worse.
            sephiroth is not more evil than ridley. he’s just not
                Ridley is not more evil than Sephiroth. He’s just not.

See how opinions work? Lol.
                    nobody here agrees with you. it seems that ur just objectively wrong and i’m assuming ur a really big fan of final fantasy 7 and don’t know a whole lot about metroid
                        Or, I just have a different opinion from you lol. I don’t think you know what the word “objectively” means. Also, I could not possibly care any less if people on reddit agreed with me or not on which video game villain is more evil, Im just having fun with the conversation.
                            Keep coping lmao
                            whatever u say bruh
                                I can almost guarantee you that they are a Sephiroth fanboy who loves the edginess lol

I myself am a fan(girl) of Sephiroth, and I completely disagree with them. I actually have sympathy for him. He was dealt a terrible hand at life to say the least. He straight up went insane.
Sephey is definitely torturing Cloud for the fun tho
    Even if that’s true, at least it’s just Cloud
        It’s still not good tho
        For now… dude could essentially be immortal.
    Sephy isn’t really the villain of 7, he’s been driven mad and Jenova is the reason he goes crazy. Jenova and Hojo are the real villains of 7.
        Jenova loses most of her autonomy. More of an extension of Sephiroth than her own consciousness.

More or less, Sephiroth assimilated Jenova into himself and his motives are his, influenced by his insanity in learning his true origins.
You do know that's Kazuya and not Ganondorf in that picture right?
    the question isn't who's the most evil in the picture

                        No, Reina is just a newcomer in Tekken 8 who is Kazuya’s half-sibling.
                            That’s what I mean, I haven’t seen anything Tekken 8 related story or character wise yet(other than hearing how Kaz sets up the new tournament) cus I haven’t got a chance to get it yet 😂

        Too true
Agreed, I would say Hojo is more evil, even if Sephiroth has committed much more heinous acts. Since Hojo made him that way and was a shit father to him too
I'm still fascinated about what would happen if somebody with no clear nationality like Armor King dies in the tournament.

Would Kazuya just go "Well fuck I guess I'll wipe out his Mexican friend's country then lmfao".
    Right. Kaz himself renounced his nationality, so if he wins does he just blow up everything?
        At least Kazuya, Heihachi, Yoshimitsu and Kunimitsu **were** Japanese which means that you have a country that is reasonable to blow up.

We just assume that the Armour Kings are mexican because the Kings are Mexican. We don't know what their face looks like which means we can't find out what their race is and just assume their race = their nationality and their skin colour isn't exactly unique to one specific nation.
How do we make Jin starting WW3 tame by comparison…

Harada: Space lasers…
mf LEAST
I would argue that Bowser is the least evil. He's just trying to be a good parent to Junior and his adopted kids; all he wants is for his kids to grow up with a mom. His methods may not always be moral, but he tries his best to accomplish his goals while causing as little harm to those around him as possible, and he's more than willing to become a hero, even if it doesn't benefit him personally. 

DDD still has bad intentions in mind, but his ways of getting there are tame in comparison to other game antagonists. 

Bowser is a rather complex character, but I'd put him on a fine line between anti-hero and anti-villain (leaning toward anti-hero), whereas DDD is just an anti-villain.
    The last time Dedede had bad intentions was basically just the original Kirby's Dream Land. Events like Revenge of the King and the story mode of Fighters 2 aren't villainous, just antagonistic, since he only wanted to prove himself to Kirby.
    DDD hasn't been a real Villain since 2008, pretty much every game after that (and almost every game before that) he's being Mind controlled or possessed
    Tell me, would someone with bad intentions do this?

https://youtu.be/_O4xvIY3MEE?si=XkAxh7eQ4P9QDySD
        Yes. In fact, it's cliché for game antagonists to sacrifice themselves as a way to redeem themselves or set up plot twists.
‘Out of a hundred young men on that ship i was the only survivor. they told my family she was destroyed in battle but i know what i saw - it had no conscience, no reasoning, only destroy.’

william ‘bill’ randa. the quote is about godzilla specifically, but i think it sums up ridley pretty well.
Hate the player not the game
It’d have to be PG-13 at the lowest but I wouldn’t mind an R-rated Metroid Film
They could just not give us Samus backstory
k rool lmao, my man won’t stop scheming on that damn crystal coconut
Nah, move Dark Pit up a bit.
    He’s not that bad
        He’s allied with Viridi, who wants to destroy humanity. He’s at least worse than Meta Knight.
Never knew Wolf was a bad guy.. then again, I don’t know much about Star Fox lore
    Yeah, he's a mercenary hired by Andross (the real big bad) to kill you at certain points in Star Fox 64.
        Damn, that’s wild. I always thought he seemed like an anti-hero, rival to fox kinda dude.
I feel like Robin should be up here, especially since smash bros robin has grima inside of him
    Robin himself goes below even Dark Pit, Grima goes somewhere in the top four (above Sephiroth, but anything above him is debatable).
But hey that’s just a theory
😂 definitely
Villager is more a victim of capitalism than anything else. Tom Nook is the true villain here.
    He gives you a home, don't make you pay more than you should (unlike every single banks) and don't care about how long you take, Tom is a good guy
TBF though, Dark Nebula gas to be the least godly of all of the villains Kirby ever fought. I don't think he's a good representation of the sheer wackery that goes on in the Kirby universe.
Exactly, why isn't he in this debate?
Well said lol. But get ready for the reddit groupthink downvote bukkake lmao.
    That’s quite a way to phrase it, but I’m just being honest when I say that I really don’t think that most understand just how evil Sephiroth really is
        I think he just went mad due to the whole Jenova thing. He burns down one village but doesnt manage to do much else in the end.
            It wasn’t just Sephiroth finding out what he really was, as he was always a monster on the battlefield. Whatever Shinra commanded him to eradicate, he did. Sephiroth isn’t just the guy who burned down Nibelheim and killed Cloud’s mother, Sephiroth is the being that was made to bring forth the end of existence and space as known to all manners of life.
                Idk if burning down a village and wanting to destroy the world is exceptionally evil, thats like every single jrpg bad guy.
                    Sephiroth doesn’t just want to destroy the world, he wants to erase life itself and replace it with something of his own.
No, not really. Ganon has a few counts of kidnapping and murder, along with leading and organizing a large paramilitary organization. Genocide too, if you count the newer games. Ridley has all that, along with multiple confirmed counts of mass genocide, aggravated robbery (an EXTREME simplification of what he's done), every type of assault under the sun except maybe sexual (I wouldn't put it past him, though), more human rights violations than there are humans and cannibalism, which I guess wouldn't apply since he's not human. All that and I'm pretty sure I haven't even scratched the
Oh most definitely. Let’s see we got a man who has tried to destroy a planet, a creature that has raided countless numbers of worlds, and a man who has committed Genocide or has tried to commit Genocide numerous times
Nah bro. Kirby will not attack unless Planet Popstar or his friends are threatened. He just wants to sleep, chill and eat cake.
Kazuya, just from the trailers alone, has straight up become a DBZ villain at this point
The only time Kazuya ever sided with anyone but himself was during tekken 5 when he and heihachi briefly fought off a horde of robots together before kazuya backstabbing heihachi by throwing him into some suicide bombers. He never plays with the heroes outside of non-canon appearances.

His abuse as a child to adult from his bastard father doesn't excuse the fact he's a corporate warmonger facilitating world war 3 in present time, blowing up cities and firing lasers on civilians, shooting out the earth's satellites to rain them on the planet like meteors, and hosting a blood tournament where the punishment for losing is both your death and the destruction of your home country. He's also extra guilty of mentally and physically torturing/beating his own son too
oh yeah I remember him being evil af on a field trip back in '95
My guy, the question is not who is more powerful, cause it's pretty obvious that's Sephiroth. It's who's more evil, and "murders for fun" is just one part of what Ridley has done. He commits robbery, genocide, and gluttony on a massive scale. 

The thing that truly sets him apart really are the horrific mengele-esque experiments he runs on various lifeforms including his own subjects. He exposes them to Radiation, Phazon and other chemicals just to see what would happen, with 0 remorse to what happens to them. Even his own men.
    Power wasn't my objective at all, but I see your point. However, this argument comes down to what we define "Evil" by. What you explained is bad for sure, but you all admit he does it for "fun" with no remorse. Sephiroth is Evil with "purpose" and puts malice in every word he speaks. He loathes what he sees before him and is driven to destroy every living thing on his planet, and beyond because they are beneath him. Experiments and torture are evil, but Ridley also has pirates doing his dirty work for him. Sephiroth wants to eliminate every living thing by his own hand, not play with them. He is the absolute end to the universe if he's  not stopped. I see as a "Pure Evil" (Seph) vs a "Chaotic Evil" (Rid) imo.
    I only mentioned Super Nova because people mention "genocide, and mass killing". How is a super nova not all of that and more.
Why Bowser?
Ridley is smarter than most humans
Not really accurate. Kirby didn't just get his personal food stolen. Dedede stole the entire Planet's food supply, everyone on Planet Popstar would have starved if he didn't get it back from him.
Please check out the intro to Tekken 8's story mode where he shoots a death laser on innocent civilians then shoots out every single satellite out of orbit so they simultaneously crash onto the planet like meteors causing indescribable mayhem, then declares world war 3, and finally announces a death tournament where he'll blow up entire countries if their respective fighters lose.
The man is just Satan, I'm surprised that wasn't apparent by now
For the people who are talking about riddly eating samus' parents, kaz did that but with his own son and father.
Did you just forget ganondorf?
    Yep. Fixing.
        Wasn’t trying to be like “ackshually” I just wanted to see your take on the king of evil lol
Kazuya, the same guy who was known for genetic testing on Humans and animals, the same guy who shot down a satellite onto a populated town on purpose, the same guy who's organising a fight to the death for the best fighter of every country to decide who he's going to nuke next
    Point taken
Kazuya is no better, and Heihachi is already dead. even then, their beef was basically just deciding which one of them would continue a tyrannical rule over the world. Kazuya's son, Jin, is the actual main character you're looking for
The Cunning God of Death
    Right it was that. What a fitting name…
    I just call him the Cunt, for shorts.
        Remember kids call men cunts and women cuntettes
        Holy Shit, that was funny. Thank you for the good laugh
Yeah and caused samus to become orphaned(which causes her to have PTSD of Ridley and she also obtains her power suit
So, Ridley's that but on a Galactic level.
    Yeah, afaik kazoo didn’t EAT anyone

Yet…
Child abuse and devil gene. Don't make for the best combo for a well mentally balanced and emotionally stable adult.
His dad threw him down a cliff when he was a kid…
    Yeah, and he did it back to him. Twice over. Do me a favour and don’t try to defend the genocidal maniac, this isn’t AOT
        It wasn’t defending them so much as pointing out that had things been different for them growing up they could have been potentially good people.

Ridley on the other hand is just naturally evil/ruthless, in every incarnation, even from birth and when shown affection
            Naturally evil ≠ most evil. I would argue that ganon or (to a much smaller extent) bowser are the most evil villains because their goals don’t stop. Ganon has a hatred that keeps him coming back throughout time in Zelda just to conquer hyrule but ultimately fails each time just to revive because of his hatred of the hero. Bowser goes about it wrong usually but he’s usually about world/galactic domination and kidnapping peach, while this usually ends up with bowser defeated (and there are games where bowser temporarily teams up with Mario) he always comes back with a bigger(possibly better) plan to rule the mushroom kingdom or galaxy depending on the game. Ridley being born sadistic isn’t evil it’s just what he was born as. It takes someone who was once good to do the worst evils imo and while ganon and bowser aren’t exactly the most evil I don’t think Ridley is all that evil either like he’s a bad creature but he’s not as evil as the games make him out he’s just a sadistic monster who hates people or something. I can’t speak to kazuya or sephiroth’s character so I’ll leave it at that
Good point. 

Ridely did destroys planets for fun and enjoys torturing others. He also has no history of mental abuse or similar. 

Ridely also doesn't wash his hands after using the restroom.
    That sick monster!

HOW CAN YOU NOT WASH YOUR HANDS?!
To be fair, sephiroth had a psychological breakdown after learning he had been lied to his entire life about his family. His attempt to destroy the planet only came close to working because of how powerful he just happened to be when he had the meltdown.
But his sneaker collection,,,
Ganondorf just wants a fight
nono he terminates organism’s lifespans don’t you get it?
    "This is not war, this is pest control!"

* Ridley
        Ridley is a mutated Dalek confirmed?
            He's a xenolek
                Well, now I'm imagining a tiny Dalek bursting out of someone's chest. Which would admittedly be horrifying as you'd hear a muffled "exterminate" followed by a muffled to not muffled "Ex...ter...mi...." ~explodes out of chest~ "nate"!

Edit: and the whole time of course the guy is screaming his head off while his chest begins glowing brighter and brighter blue.
                    Lol I imagine it would be like a Russian doll where the guy bursts out of the dalek and the xeno bursts out the guy
            I don't know much about Doctor Who but I thought all Daleks were mutated, then genetically modified and turned into cyborgs?


If so Ridley is basically what they could achieve if they weren't mutated.
                They're not Cyborgs. They're a lifeform that are encased in a battle armor. A mutated Dalek is not a Dalek because it would be deemed imperfect. Daleks are in their eyes the superior lifeform and nothing else is worthy of life.

Pure hatred for anything other than Dalek. They were created through genetic modification but once Dalek they approve of nothing else.

The Daleks were once forced to be recreated by genetically modifying human DNA and their own technology didn't recognize them as Dalek so they had to trick the Doctor into confirming they were Dalek so they could create pure Daleks again.

As soon as the new pure Daleks were created they forced the impure ones to self destruct because they were not Dalek.
                    Thanks for the lore. Always love me some lore.
                        Heck yeah, lore is life.
        I would genuinely believe he said this in the manga
        If that’s his thoughts then he’s not so evil he just doesn’t think of us as equals I mean if you tallied up all the mosquitoes you’ve killed and it’s like 10,000 or something your not evil but if Ridley does his version of that it’s a war crime for killing 10,000 humans.
    He puts em six feet under, got ‘em sleepin with the fishes, takes ‘em for a ride, gives ‘em acid bath, buy ‘em some cement shoes, get ‘em fitted for a coffin,  drives ‘em to the farm upstate, puts ‘em down, put ‘em to bed, makes ‘em see the pearly gates, they’ll be pushing up daisies, snuffed, croaked, un-alived, he’ll give ‘em suicide assistance, a real dirt nap, the big sleep, fill ‘em fulla lead, really let ‘em have it…

… and he’ll kill ‘em too!
Murder, kill... it's ultimately meaningless when the end result is all the same.
Doesn't the term "murder" only apply if the killer and the killed are of the same species? I don't think Ridley is that particilar with his killing.
    No, it refers to the intentional killing of a human by another human.

But that's only because humans are the only animals we know we a similar intelligence.

So one could extend it to a person killing another person if you could find non-human persons.
Murder only applies to humans
    and crows...
Murder refers to the killing of humans.

You could extend it to other beings with a level of sentience complex enough to be called "a person", but still limited to killing people.

Ridley kills everything, not just people, and so it isn't murder.
    Its murder. Stop.
"It wasn't"murder" your Honour, my client was merely ending lifeforms. Helping nature in its cycle.
True, it comes off as so petty. I feel like the only Nintendo villains pettier than him are the  two dream spirits from Kirby, Nightmare and Elfilis. Both of them were willing to crash two planetary bodies together just to take out Kirby (though tbf it's only in the anime for Nightmare, and I can probably find way more examples of  pettiness from all of the villains in there). PS, it was Samus' mother that was eaten, iirc her dad blew himself up with all of the space pirates when he was guarding a cargo ship.
Does that somehow make him less evil?
    No I don’t think so
        Samus even has PTSD of Ridley (shown in other m and Ridley’s reveal trailer)
            Do you have a point you're making here or did you just word your comment weirdly as if you did? I'm not sure what you're trying to say here.
            That other m PTSD thing is stupid and you know it. Also I’m pretty sure the reveal trailer was just her being caught off guard considering it ends with her going straight for him.
Twice, mind you 

He waited for her to get adopted and then killed her new parents
Key word tried, I love FF7 but Ridley has killed multiple planets worth of creatures. If by any chance sephiroth won he probably would have traveled the galaxy consuming other planets, but he never made it that far
    Also Sephiroth did it out of some obsession for Jevona and a messiah complex where Ridley did it multiple time just because he could
        And depending on how canon you consider the Manga to be, he also killed and ate Samus' parents in front of her knowing they were related to her.
    I mean yeah, but this is in regards to how evil they are, and they were both determined to do the same thing just for the sake of it, it’s just one managed to succeed, but they’re both just as evil. Also the answer for this is technically like Galeem/Dharkon no?
        If intent matters then so does reason, no?

If Sephiroth does it for his mother (or something) and Ridley does it for entertainment and sadistic pleasure then Ridley takes the medal?
His goal wasn't just to hurt and kill, it was to gain power, and eventually to create a new world. He was indifferent to the pain he caused, but it wasn't his goal... except Cloud, he loved fucking with Cloud.
Sephiroth killed clouds mom completely unnecessarily on his way out of burning down his home town because he felt like it, and forces cloud to relive the moment at random through induced hallucinations, just to torment him lol.
    Ridley killed samus's parents in front of her, and years later after he found out that she had foster parents, he killed them in front of her too
        If I remember correctly, he ate the bodies after for his own survival
            Yeah and literally sent samus into a fucking PTSD driven shock where she literally begged for someone to kill her because she thought ridley's murder of the whole planet was inevitable
                We don't talk about Other M.
    And killed his friend aerith in front of him, and his party
They *might have been. He didn’t actually discern whether or not it was her parents because he didn’t care enough to make note of who he was eating.
Sephiroth has a motive, a strange one, a motive nonetheless

Ridley is just in it for fun, I doubt he even cares about the whole pirate part of his job and just uses it to kill
    I don’t really follow that logic. It’s like saying a dictator who commits genocide because he thinks his people are superior is less evil than a thrill seeking serial killer. Someone who kills for fun is just fucked in the head. Someone who is actually coherent and justifies their actions is way more evil imo.
        After he meets MB, he does become contractually obligated to have a motive, which is forcing the galaxy into “peace” by killing everyone who disagrees with them, most notably, the Galactic Federation
        i think you forgot that the thrill serial killer has a higher body count than the dictator
            Body count isnt really relevant. We’re talking about fundamental personality. By your logic, Ridley is more evil than Frieza from Dragonball because he just kills for fun, but Frieza has murdered trillions.
        I don’t know why this is getting downvoted, makes sense to me
            Because it apparently feels good to downvote benign video game opinions you don’t agree with lmao.
                Isn't disagreeing like... the point of downvotes?
                    Not really. It’s to block out misinformation / hate, unrelated / off-topic discussion, etc. gives the person bad karma and prevents the spread of their post. After a certain number the post gets hidden, etc. If you disagree with someone’s benign opinion you talk about it with them. It’s just that it’s really easy to just downvote so it has become a tool to pile-on, but thats not what it’s really for.

The official word on the purpose of downvotes from Reddit themselves: 

>Vote. If you think something contributes to conversation, upvote it. If you think it does not contribute to the subreddit it is posted in or is off-topic in a particular community, downvote it.

So if someone asks “which villain is the most evil?”, and I say A and you say B, we can talk about it.. no one needs to dowvote because its all on topic lol. If I came in and say “Toyota’s are fantastic cars” then the purpose of a downvote is to hide unrelated posts or offensive posts etc. but people feel better about themselves when they do it apparently. I almost never downvote vote because off topic / offensive stuff is almost always already gone by the time I get in threads.
                        I mean, you downvoted literally every opinion I made that disagreed with you lol. So I assumed you were saying you disagreed with me in those situations.
                            Oof doesn't look great to be sanctimonious about downvotes but still use them like everyone else 💀 sucks for him I guess
                            I did it because everyone was doing it to me lol. So I should correct that, I only senselessly downvote when it’s senselessly done to my on-topic post. Have you seen all my posts on here? I assumed you were doing it to mine. Lol
                        Maybe that's the intended use, but the social climate dictates that's just how it be. Not everyone is gonna want to have a civilised discussion, or has the time, so the downvote becomes a good way to express agreement or disagreement with a comment
                            Im just answering the question you asked.
        Well the thing is that Ridley is part of the space pirates, who in Prime 3 essentially have attempted to genocide entire planets to turn them into fuel for their weapons.
            Okay? I don’t see how that changes anything. If anything that just gives him a motivation, but one less interesting but one none-the-less.
Having a motive for killing is less “evil” than doing it for the lol’s. 

One wouldn’t kill without the motive, it’s just something they have to do to accomplish their goals. The other one literally derives pleasure from the act of evil.
    I disagree with that. In fact, BECAUSE they have a motive many of the motivated villains derive pleasure from killing as well. If not more. Sephiroth DEFINITELY enjoys killing people, for example. I said it in another reply but I’ll repeat here: a dictator who kills people because he believes his people are better then everyone else is far more evil, and also takes delight in killing, versus someone who just takes delight in killing. I fail to see how the latter is worse thn someone who knows fully well its wrong, enjoys it, AND thinks it’s righteous to do.
        Yes, they think it’s righteous to do so, which means they **do not believe** what they are doing is evil. These people would not kill without motive. 

The person who kills for fun knows what they’re doing is wrong and **does not care**. That is literally the definition of evil. They revel in their wickedness and amorality.
            It doesnt matter if they would kill with or without motive if the motive is that everyone but them should be dead lmao.
                Yes, but the key difference is **both** of these villains want everyone dead. Except one thinks it’s right, the other knows it’s wrong and LIKES that. 

That is empirically, literally, more evil by definition. Profoundly immoral and wicked. 

Sephiroth is less evil than Ridley. But that’s a good thing, because he has more depth as a character.
                    It doesn’t make a difference to me. Especially since Sephiroth very clearly also enjoys it. He’s like ridley but with his actions being righteous added on top of it. He literally wields a cloud of tormented souls that he wont let pass on to the afterlife. He’s not just on a crusade, he’s also sadistic. He didn’t have to kill aerith, he didnt have to kill clouds mom, or pretty much anyone else he killed. He just wanted to, and revels in it.
                        Yes, Sephiroth revels in it because he believes it is his divine right. He believes he is exacting moral, righteous vengeance against the people who genocided his ancestors. He’s like the Doom Slayer, who takes pleasure in murdering demons because he believes all of them are evil. They both view their killing and torture as justified and it’s strictly a matter of perspective. 

That is not more evil than someone killing because “fuck yeah evil.” I just like murder, hoo rah. 

Like I don’t know how to make it any more obvious lol. You’re arguing against the very definition of what evil is. At this point I can only assume you’re a big fan of Sephiroth so you **want** him to be the most evil in this situation but you’re actively advocating for Sephiroth to be way edgier and lamer than he actually is.
                            You can assume whatever you want, but it’s just a difference of opinion, and we have 3 options based on the OPs prompt, so I could assume the same about you regarding ridley. It’s not like we are discussing every villain in history here. And, “The very definition of evil” is essentially “immorality and wickedness”. I don’t know how to make it more obvious to you that mudering anything and everything that isn’t you and seeking to go do the same throughout the cosmos, and taking pleasure in keeping the tormented souls of millions of people at his whim for no reason other than to be cruel to them, is more evil than someone killing people because they can and enjoy it. That’s 1 rung below sephiroth. And by your same logic, ridley’s moral compass is that he can do what he wants / finds fun. Every character can be simplified in that way.

In fact you literally have a painting of Satan as your avatar. Satan is literally the embodiment of evil and Sephiroth is very heavily based on him (one winged angel?) and their motivations are very similar. you think Ridley is more evil than satan? Lol
        Someone who thinks they're the hero of their story, even though they're the villain in others is less evil than someone who is the villain in any story and is cool with that.
            What? The only difference in that logic, then, is ridley thinking he’s the villain to himself. Sephiroth would not be a hero to anyone as he is in ff7. Except maybe Hojo. But ridley has allies as well, even if they are also shitty (just as hojo is)

If two people randomly killed someone and got interviewed and one says “it seemed fun” and the other says “I did it because all people deserve to die”, to me the latter is worse.
                Yeah, that's about it.

If someone thinks they're making something better by doing awful things, they're less evil than people who do awful things because it makes everything worse.
        sephiroth is not more evil than ridley. he’s just not
            Ridley is not more evil than Sephiroth. He’s just not.

See how opinions work? Lol.
                nobody here agrees with you. it seems that ur just objectively wrong and i’m assuming ur a really big fan of final fantasy 7 and don’t know a whole lot about metroid
                    Or, I just have a different opinion from you lol. I don’t think you know what the word “objectively” means. Also, I could not possibly care any less if people on reddit agreed with me or not on which video game villain is more evil, Im just having fun with the conversation.
                        Keep coping lmao
                        whatever u say bruh
                            I can almost guarantee you that they are a Sephiroth fanboy who loves the edginess lol

I myself am a fan(girl) of Sephiroth, and I completely disagree with them. I actually have sympathy for him. He was dealt a terrible hand at life to say the least. He straight up went insane.
Even if that’s true, at least it’s just Cloud
    It’s still not good tho
    For now… dude could essentially be immortal.
Sephy isn’t really the villain of 7, he’s been driven mad and Jenova is the reason he goes crazy. Jenova and Hojo are the real villains of 7.
    Jenova loses most of her autonomy. More of an extension of Sephiroth than her own consciousness.

More or less, Sephiroth assimilated Jenova into himself and his motives are his, influenced by his insanity in learning his true origins.
the question isn't who's the most evil in the picture
Because he's a Mii Gunner. No other reason is necessary. People who play that character only exist to make the game worse for everyone else. That's pretty evil.

I play Mii Gunner because it’s the closest I’ll get to Doomguy in Smash.

We are not the same
        I mean you guys are basically on the same level as puppy killers. When it comes down to it, does the REASON you're a puppy killer make that much of a difference?

I do have about 30 villagers “working” for me. Some farm, some just breed, others are just stuck in a tiny room with nothing but a book waiting to trade my 10 sticks for the endless amounts of emeralds they have.
I have two parents who say they love me but I’m not really sure if they do and a sibling who they say they love equally but I’m not sure if they do.
That was technically Jin. In the newest game he is doing some wild shit
His son caused ww3 to kill the origin of the devil gene (and failed)
    Ok I don't know my tekken lore I am just aware that ever since Heihachi had kids the world has suffered for it
        Yeah that's about right. Only good one is Lars
            Even as far as his kids go the only ones who actually liked him are literally 2 bears
            Reina seems batshit crazy I wouldn’t get hopes up considering her victory cutscenes in Tekken 8 💀
                Did I just read something I shouldn’t have?
                    No, Reina is just a newcomer in Tekken 8 who is Kazuya’s half-sibling.
                        That’s what I mean, I haven’t seen anything Tekken 8 related story or character wise yet(other than hearing how Kaz sets up the new tournament) cus I haven’t got a chance to get it yet 😂
                            Lol I see. I mean her trailer is already out, so it’s not really a spoiler or anything
Nah that was Jin, Kazuya is starting some end of the world shit in T8 as far as I know from the demo but that’s basically the craziest thing he’s done
Hojo is the true monster in FF7, almost every problem in the 7 saga relates to Hojo in  one way or another.
    Too true
Right. Kaz himself renounced his nationality, so if he wins does he just blow up everything?
    At least Kazuya, Heihachi, Yoshimitsu and Kunimitsu **were** Japanese which means that you have a country that is reasonable to blow up.

We just assume that the Armour Kings are mexican because the Kings are Mexican. We don't know what their face looks like which means we can't find out what their race is and just assume their race = their nationality and their skin colour isn't exactly unique to one specific nation.
The last time Dedede had bad intentions was basically just the original Kirby's Dream Land. Events like Revenge of the King and the story mode of Fighters 2 aren't villainous, just antagonistic, since he only wanted to prove himself to Kirby.
DDD hasn't been a real Villain since 2008, pretty much every game after that (and almost every game before that) he's being Mind controlled or possessed
Tell me, would someone with bad intentions do this?

https://youtu.be/_O4xvIY3MEE?si=XkAxh7eQ4P9QDySD
    Yes. In fact, it's cliché for game antagonists to sacrifice themselves as a way to redeem themselves or set up plot twists.
He’s not that bad
    He’s allied with Viridi, who wants to destroy humanity. He’s at least worse than Meta Knight.
Yeah, he's a mercenary hired by Andross (the real big bad) to kill you at certain points in Star Fox 64.
    Damn, that’s wild. I always thought he seemed like an anti-hero, rival to fox kinda dude.
Robin himself goes below even Dark Pit, Grima goes somewhere in the top four (above Sephiroth, but anything above him is debatable).
He gives you a home, don't make you pay more than you should (unlike every single banks) and don't care about how long you take, Tom is a good guy
That’s quite a way to phrase it, but I’m just being honest when I say that I really don’t think that most understand just how evil Sephiroth really is
    I think he just went mad due to the whole Jenova thing. He burns down one village but doesnt manage to do much else in the end.
        It wasn’t just Sephiroth finding out what he really was, as he was always a monster on the battlefield. Whatever Shinra commanded him to eradicate, he did. Sephiroth isn’t just the guy who burned down Nibelheim and killed Cloud’s mother, Sephiroth is the being that was made to bring forth the end of existence and space as known to all manners of life.
            Idk if burning down a village and wanting to destroy the world is exceptionally evil, thats like every single jrpg bad guy.
                Sephiroth doesn’t just want to destroy the world, he wants to erase life itself and replace it with something of his own.
Power wasn't my objective at all, but I see your point. However, this argument comes down to what we define "Evil" by. What you explained is bad for sure, but you all admit he does it for "fun" with no remorse. Sephiroth is Evil with "purpose" and puts malice in every word he speaks. He loathes what he sees before him and is driven to destroy every living thing on his planet, and beyond because they are beneath him. Experiments and torture are evil, but Ridley also has pirates doing his dirty work for him. Sephiroth wants to eliminate every living thing by his own hand, not play with them. He is the absolute end to the universe if he's  not stopped. I see as a "Pure Evil" (Seph) vs a "Chaotic Evil" (Rid) imo.
I only mentioned Super Nova because people mention "genocide, and mass killing". How is a super nova not all of that and more.
Yep. Fixing.
    Wasn’t trying to be like “ackshually” I just wanted to see your take on the king of evil lol
Point taken
Right it was that. What a fitting name…
I just call him the Cunt, for shorts.
    Remember kids call men cunts and women cuntettes
    Holy Shit, that was funny. Thank you for the good laugh
Yeah, afaik kazoo didn’t EAT anyone

Yet…
Yeah, and he did it back to him. Twice over. Do me a favour and don’t try to defend the genocidal maniac, this isn’t AOT
    It wasn’t defending them so much as pointing out that had things been different for them growing up they could have been potentially good people.

Ridley on the other hand is just naturally evil/ruthless, in every incarnation, even from birth and when shown affection
        Naturally evil ≠ most evil. I would argue that ganon or (to a much smaller extent) bowser are the most evil villains because their goals don’t stop. Ganon has a hatred that keeps him coming back throughout time in Zelda just to conquer hyrule but ultimately fails each time just to revive because of his hatred of the hero. Bowser goes about it wrong usually but he’s usually about world/galactic domination and kidnapping peach, while this usually ends up with bowser defeated (and there are games where bowser temporarily teams up with Mario) he always comes back with a bigger(possibly better) plan to rule the mushroom kingdom or galaxy depending on the game. Ridley being born sadistic isn’t evil it’s just what he was born as. It takes someone who was once good to do the worst evils imo and while ganon and bowser aren’t exactly the most evil I don’t think Ridley is all that evil either like he’s a bad creature but he’s not as evil as the games make him out he’s just a sadistic monster who hates people or something. I can’t speak to kazuya or sephiroth’s character so I’ll leave it at that
That sick monster!

HOW CAN YOU NOT WASH YOUR HANDS?!
"This is not war, this is pest control!"

* Ridley
    Ridley is a mutated Dalek confirmed?
        He's a xenolek
            Well, now I'm imagining a tiny Dalek bursting out of someone's chest. Which would admittedly be horrifying as you'd hear a muffled "exterminate" followed by a muffled to not muffled "Ex...ter...mi...." ~explodes out of chest~ "nate"!

Edit: and the whole time of course the guy is screaming his head off while his chest begins glowing brighter and brighter blue.
                Lol I imagine it would be like a Russian doll where the guy bursts out of the dalek and the xeno bursts out the guy
        I don't know much about Doctor Who but I thought all Daleks were mutated, then genetically modified and turned into cyborgs?


If so Ridley is basically what they could achieve if they weren't mutated.
            They're not Cyborgs. They're a lifeform that are encased in a battle armor. A mutated Dalek is not a Dalek because it would be deemed imperfect. Daleks are in their eyes the superior lifeform and nothing else is worthy of life.

Pure hatred for anything other than Dalek. They were created through genetic modification but once Dalek they approve of nothing else.

The Daleks were once forced to be recreated by genetically modifying human DNA and their own technology didn't recognize them as Dalek so they had to trick the Doctor into confirming they were Dalek so they could create pure Daleks again.

As soon as the new pure Daleks were created they forced the impure ones to self destruct because they were not Dalek.
                Thanks for the lore. Always love me some lore.
                    Heck yeah, lore is life.
    I would genuinely believe he said this in the manga
    If that’s his thoughts then he’s not so evil he just doesn’t think of us as equals I mean if you tallied up all the mosquitoes you’ve killed and it’s like 10,000 or something your not evil but if Ridley does his version of that it’s a war crime for killing 10,000 humans.
He puts em six feet under, got ‘em sleepin with the fishes, takes ‘em for a ride, gives ‘em acid bath, buy ‘em some cement shoes, get ‘em fitted for a coffin,  drives ‘em to the farm upstate, puts ‘em down, put ‘em to bed, makes ‘em see the pearly gates, they’ll be pushing up daisies, snuffed, croaked, un-alived, he’ll give ‘em suicide assistance, a real dirt nap, the big sleep, fill ‘em fulla lead, really let ‘em have it…

… and he’ll kill ‘em too!
No, it refers to the intentional killing of a human by another human.

But that's only because humans are the only animals we know we a similar intelligence.

So one could extend it to a person killing another person if you could find non-human persons.
and crows...
Its murder. Stop.
No I don’t think so
    Samus even has PTSD of Ridley (shown in other m and Ridley’s reveal trailer)
        Do you have a point you're making here or did you just word your comment weirdly as if you did? I'm not sure what you're trying to say here.
        That other m PTSD thing is stupid and you know it. Also I’m pretty sure the reveal trailer was just her being caught off guard considering it ends with her going straight for him.
Also Sephiroth did it out of some obsession for Jevona and a messiah complex where Ridley did it multiple time just because he could
    And depending on how canon you consider the Manga to be, he also killed and ate Samus' parents in front of her knowing they were related to her.
I mean yeah, but this is in regards to how evil they are, and they were both determined to do the same thing just for the sake of it, it’s just one managed to succeed, but they’re both just as evil. Also the answer for this is technically like Galeem/Dharkon no?
    If intent matters then so does reason, no?

If Sephiroth does it for his mother (or something) and Ridley does it for entertainment and sadistic pleasure then Ridley takes the medal?
Ridley killed samus's parents in front of her, and years later after he found out that she had foster parents, he killed them in front of her too
    If I remember correctly, he ate the bodies after for his own survival
        Yeah and literally sent samus into a fucking PTSD driven shock where she literally begged for someone to kill her because she thought ridley's murder of the whole planet was inevitable
            We don't talk about Other M.
And killed his friend aerith in front of him, and his party
I don’t really follow that logic. It’s like saying a dictator who commits genocide because he thinks his people are superior is less evil than a thrill seeking serial killer. Someone who kills for fun is just fucked in the head. Someone who is actually coherent and justifies their actions is way more evil imo.
    After he meets MB, he does become contractually obligated to have a motive, which is forcing the galaxy into “peace” by killing everyone who disagrees with them, most notably, the Galactic Federation
    i think you forgot that the thrill serial killer has a higher body count than the dictator
        Body count isnt really relevant. We’re talking about fundamental personality. By your logic, Ridley is more evil than Frieza from Dragonball because he just kills for fun, but Frieza has murdered trillions.
    I don’t know why this is getting downvoted, makes sense to me
        Because it apparently feels good to downvote benign video game opinions you don’t agree with lmao.
            Isn't disagreeing like... the point of downvotes?
                Not really. It’s to block out misinformation / hate, unrelated / off-topic discussion, etc. gives the person bad karma and prevents the spread of their post. After a certain number the post gets hidden, etc. If you disagree with someone’s benign opinion you talk about it with them. It’s just that it’s really easy to just downvote so it has become a tool to pile-on, but thats not what it’s really for.

The official word on the purpose of downvotes from Reddit themselves: 

>Vote. If you think something contributes to conversation, upvote it. If you think it does not contribute to the subreddit it is posted in or is off-topic in a particular community, downvote it.

So if someone asks “which villain is the most evil?”, and I say A and you say B, we can talk about it.. no one needs to dowvote because its all on topic lol. If I came in and say “Toyota’s are fantastic cars” then the purpose of a downvote is to hide unrelated posts or offensive posts etc. but people feel better about themselves when they do it apparently. I almost never downvote vote because off topic / offensive stuff is almost always already gone by the time I get in threads.
                    I mean, you downvoted literally every opinion I made that disagreed with you lol. So I assumed you were saying you disagreed with me in those situations.
                        Oof doesn't look great to be sanctimonious about downvotes but still use them like everyone else 💀 sucks for him I guess
                        I did it because everyone was doing it to me lol. So I should correct that, I only senselessly downvote when it’s senselessly done to my on-topic post. Have you seen all my posts on here? I assumed you were doing it to mine. Lol
                    Maybe that's the intended use, but the social climate dictates that's just how it be. Not everyone is gonna want to have a civilised discussion, or has the time, so the downvote becomes a good way to express agreement or disagreement with a comment
                        Im just answering the question you asked.
    Well the thing is that Ridley is part of the space pirates, who in Prime 3 essentially have attempted to genocide entire planets to turn them into fuel for their weapons.
        Okay? I don’t see how that changes anything. If anything that just gives him a motivation, but one less interesting but one none-the-less.
I disagree with that. In fact, BECAUSE they have a motive many of the motivated villains derive pleasure from killing as well. If not more. Sephiroth DEFINITELY enjoys killing people, for example. I said it in another reply but I’ll repeat here: a dictator who kills people because he believes his people are better then everyone else is far more evil, and also takes delight in killing, versus someone who just takes delight in killing. I fail to see how the latter is worse thn someone who knows fully well its wrong, enjoys it, AND thinks it’s righteous to do.
    Yes, they think it’s righteous to do so, which means they **do not believe** what they are doing is evil. These people would not kill without motive. 

The person who kills for fun knows what they’re doing is wrong and **does not care**. That is literally the definition of evil. They revel in their wickedness and amorality.
        It doesnt matter if they would kill with or without motive if the motive is that everyone but them should be dead lmao.
            Yes, but the key difference is **both** of these villains want everyone dead. Except one thinks it’s right, the other knows it’s wrong and LIKES that. 

That is empirically, literally, more evil by definition. Profoundly immoral and wicked. 

Sephiroth is less evil than Ridley. But that’s a good thing, because he has more depth as a character.
                It doesn’t make a difference to me. Especially since Sephiroth very clearly also enjoys it. He’s like ridley but with his actions being righteous added on top of it. He literally wields a cloud of tormented souls that he wont let pass on to the afterlife. He’s not just on a crusade, he’s also sadistic. He didn’t have to kill aerith, he didnt have to kill clouds mom, or pretty much anyone else he killed. He just wanted to, and revels in it.
                    Yes, Sephiroth revels in it because he believes it is his divine right. He believes he is exacting moral, righteous vengeance against the people who genocided his ancestors. He’s like the Doom Slayer, who takes pleasure in murdering demons because he believes all of them are evil. They both view their killing and torture as justified and it’s strictly a matter of perspective. 

That is not more evil than someone killing because “fuck yeah evil.” I just like murder, hoo rah. 

Like I don’t know how to make it any more obvious lol. You’re arguing against the very definition of what evil is. At this point I can only assume you’re a big fan of Sephiroth so you **want** him to be the most evil in this situation but you’re actively advocating for Sephiroth to be way edgier and lamer than he actually is.
                        You can assume whatever you want, but it’s just a difference of opinion, and we have 3 options based on the OPs prompt, so I could assume the same about you regarding ridley. It’s not like we are discussing every villain in history here. And, “The very definition of evil” is essentially “immorality and wickedness”. I don’t know how to make it more obvious to you that mudering anything and everything that isn’t you and seeking to go do the same throughout the cosmos, and taking pleasure in keeping the tormented souls of millions of people at his whim for no reason other than to be cruel to them, is more evil than someone killing people because they can and enjoy it. That’s 1 rung below sephiroth. And by your same logic, ridley’s moral compass is that he can do what he wants / finds fun. Every character can be simplified in that way.

In fact you literally have a painting of Satan as your avatar. Satan is literally the embodiment of evil and Sephiroth is very heavily based on him (one winged angel?) and their motivations are very similar. you think Ridley is more evil than satan? Lol
    Someone who thinks they're the hero of their story, even though they're the villain in others is less evil than someone who is the villain in any story and is cool with that.
        What? The only difference in that logic, then, is ridley thinking he’s the villain to himself. Sephiroth would not be a hero to anyone as he is in ff7. Except maybe Hojo. But ridley has allies as well, even if they are also shitty (just as hojo is)

If two people randomly killed someone and got interviewed and one says “it seemed fun” and the other says “I did it because all people deserve to die”, to me the latter is worse.
            Yeah, that's about it.

If someone thinks they're making something better by doing awful things, they're less evil than people who do awful things because it makes everything worse.
    sephiroth is not more evil than ridley. he’s just not
        Ridley is not more evil than Sephiroth. He’s just not.

See how opinions work? Lol.
            nobody here agrees with you. it seems that ur just objectively wrong and i’m assuming ur a really big fan of final fantasy 7 and don’t know a whole lot about metroid
                Or, I just have a different opinion from you lol. I don’t think you know what the word “objectively” means. Also, I could not possibly care any less if people on reddit agreed with me or not on which video game villain is more evil, Im just having fun with the conversation.
                    Keep coping lmao
                    whatever u say bruh
                        I can almost guarantee you that they are a Sephiroth fanboy who loves the edginess lol

I myself am a fan(girl) of Sephiroth, and I completely disagree with them. I actually have sympathy for him. He was dealt a terrible hand at life to say the least. He straight up went insane.
It’s still not good tho
For now… dude could essentially be immortal.
Jenova loses most of her autonomy. More of an extension of Sephiroth than her own consciousness.

More or less, Sephiroth assimilated Jenova into himself and his motives are his, influenced by his insanity in learning his true origins.

People play Mii Gunner to torture other players

I play Mii Gunner because it’s the closest I’ll get to Doomguy in Smash.

It wasn’t defending them so much as pointing out that had things been different for them growing up they could have been potentially good people.

Ridley on the other hand is just naturally evil/ruthless, in every incarnation, even from birth and when shown affection
    Naturally evil ≠ most evil. I would argue that ganon or (to a much smaller extent) bowser are the most evil villains because their goals don’t stop. Ganon has a hatred that keeps him coming back throughout time in Zelda just to conquer hyrule but ultimately fails each time just to revive because of his hatred of the hero. Bowser goes about it wrong usually but he’s usually about world/galactic domination and kidnapping peach, while this usually ends up with bowser defeated (and there are games where bowser temporarily teams up with Mario) he always comes back with a bigger(possibly better) plan to rule the mushroom kingdom or galaxy depending on the game. Ridley being born sadistic isn’t evil it’s just what he was born as. It takes someone who was once good to do the worst evils imo and while ganon and bowser aren’t exactly the most evil I don’t think Ridley is all that evil either like he’s a bad creature but he’s not as evil as the games make him out he’s just a sadistic monster who hates people or something. I can’t speak to kazuya or sephiroth’s character so I’ll leave it at that

    Body count isnt really relevant. We’re talking about fundamental personality. By your logic, Ridley is more evil than Frieza from Dragonball because he just kills for fun, but Frieza has murdered trillions.

                    I did it because everyone was doing it to me lol. So I should correct that, I only senselessly downvote when it’s senselessly done to my on-topic post. Have you seen all my posts on here? I assumed you were doing it to mine. Lol
                Maybe that's the intended use, but the social climate dictates that's just how it be. Not everyone is gonna want to have a civilised discussion, or has the time, so the downvote becomes a good way to express agreement or disagreement with a comment
                    Im just answering the question you asked.
Well the thing is that Ridley is part of the space pirates, who in Prime 3 essentially have attempted to genocide entire planets to turn them into fuel for their weapons.
    Okay? I don’t see how that changes anything. If anything that just gives him a motivation, but one less interesting but one none-the-less.
Yes, they think it’s righteous to do so, which means they **do not believe** what they are doing is evil. These people would not kill without motive. 

The person who kills for fun knows what they’re doing is wrong and **does not care**. That is literally the definition of evil. They revel in their wickedness and amorality.
    It doesnt matter if they would kill with or without motive if the motive is that everyone but them should be dead lmao.
        Yes, but the key difference is **both** of these villains want everyone dead. Except one thinks it’s right, the other knows it’s wrong and LIKES that. 

That is empirically, literally, more evil by definition. Profoundly immoral and wicked. 

Sephiroth is less evil than Ridley. But that’s a good thing, because he has more depth as a character.
            It doesn’t make a difference to me. Especially since Sephiroth very clearly also enjoys it. He’s like ridley but with his actions being righteous added on top of it. He literally wields a cloud of tormented souls that he wont let pass on to the afterlife. He’s not just on a crusade, he’s also sadistic. He didn’t have to kill aerith, he didnt have to kill clouds mom, or pretty much anyone else he killed. He just wanted to, and revels in it.
                Yes, Sephiroth revels in it because he believes it is his divine right. He believes he is exacting moral, righteous vengeance against the people who genocided his ancestors. He’s like the Doom Slayer, who takes pleasure in murdering demons because he believes all of them are evil. They both view their killing and torture as justified and it’s strictly a matter of perspective. 

That is not more evil than someone killing because “fuck yeah evil.” I just like murder, hoo rah. 

Like I don’t know how to make it any more obvious lol. You’re arguing against the very definition of what evil is. At this point I can only assume you’re a big fan of Sephiroth so you **want** him to be the most evil in this situation but you’re actively advocating for Sephiroth to be way edgier and lamer than he actually is.
                    You can assume whatever you want, but it’s just a difference of opinion, and we have 3 options based on the OPs prompt, so I could assume the same about you regarding ridley. It’s not like we are discussing every villain in history here. And, “The very definition of evil” is essentially “immorality and wickedness”. I don’t know how to make it more obvious to you that mudering anything and everything that isn’t you and seeking to go do the same throughout the cosmos, and taking pleasure in keeping the tormented souls of millions of people at his whim for no reason other than to be cruel to them, is more evil than someone killing people because they can and enjoy it. That’s 1 rung below sephiroth. And by your same logic, ridley’s moral compass is that he can do what he wants / finds fun. Every character can be simplified in that way.

In fact you literally have a painting of Satan as your avatar. Satan is literally the embodiment of evil and Sephiroth is very heavily based on him (one winged angel?) and their motivations are very similar. you think Ridley is more evil than satan? Lol
Someone who thinks they're the hero of their story, even though they're the villain in others is less evil than someone who is the villain in any story and is cool with that.
    What? The only difference in that logic, then, is ridley thinking he’s the villain to himself. Sephiroth would not be a hero to anyone as he is in ff7. Except maybe Hojo. But ridley has allies as well, even if they are also shitty (just as hojo is)

If two people randomly killed someone and got interviewed and one says “it seemed fun” and the other says “I did it because all people deserve to die”, to me the latter is worse.
        Yeah, that's about it.

If someone thinks they're making something better by doing awful things, they're less evil than people who do awful things because it makes everything worse.
sephiroth is not more evil than ridley. he’s just not
    Ridley is not more evil than Sephiroth. He’s just not.

See how opinions work? Lol.
        nobody here agrees with you. it seems that ur just objectively wrong and i’m assuming ur a really big fan of final fantasy 7 and don’t know a whole lot about metroid
            Or, I just have a different opinion from you lol. I don’t think you know what the word “objectively” means. Also, I could not possibly care any less if people on reddit agreed with me or not on which video game villain is more evil, Im just having fun with the conversation.
                Keep coping lmao
                whatever u say bruh
                    I can almost guarantee you that they are a Sephiroth fanboy who loves the edginess lol

I myself am a fan(girl) of Sephiroth, and I completely disagree with them. I actually have sympathy for him. He was dealt a terrible hand at life to say the least. He straight up went insane.
![gif](giphy|PiBkxZr38ZR72)
    why is this scary
I mean you guys are basically on the same level as puppy killers. When it comes down to it, does the REASON you're a puppy killer make that much of a difference?
Yeah that's about right. Only good one is Lars
    Even as far as his kids go the only ones who actually liked him are literally 2 bears
    Reina seems batshit crazy I wouldn’t get hopes up considering her victory cutscenes in Tekken 8 💀
        Did I just read something I shouldn’t have?
            No, Reina is just a newcomer in Tekken 8 who is Kazuya’s half-sibling.
                That’s what I mean, I haven’t seen anything Tekken 8 related story or character wise yet(other than hearing how Kaz sets up the new tournament) cus I haven’t got a chance to get it yet 😂
                    Lol I see. I mean her trailer is already out, so it’s not really a spoiler or anything
It wasn’t just Sephiroth finding out what he really was, as he was always a monster on the battlefield. Whatever Shinra commanded him to eradicate, he did. Sephiroth isn’t just the guy who burned down Nibelheim and killed Cloud’s mother, Sephiroth is the being that was made to bring forth the end of existence and space as known to all manners of life.
    Idk if burning down a village and wanting to destroy the world is exceptionally evil, thats like every single jrpg bad guy.
        Sephiroth doesn’t just want to destroy the world, he wants to erase life itself and replace it with something of his own.
Naturally evil ≠ most evil. I would argue that ganon or (to a much smaller extent) bowser are the most evil villains because their goals don’t stop. Ganon has a hatred that keeps him coming back throughout time in Zelda just to conquer hyrule but ultimately fails each time just to revive because of his hatred of the hero. Bowser goes about it wrong usually but he’s usually about world/galactic domination and kidnapping peach, while this usually ends up with bowser defeated (and there are games where bowser temporarily teams up with Mario) he always comes back with a bigger(possibly better) plan to rule the mushroom kingdom or galaxy depending on the game. Ridley being born sadistic isn’t evil it’s just what he was born as. It takes someone who was once good to do the worst evils imo and while ganon and bowser aren’t exactly the most evil I don’t think Ridley is all that evil either like he’s a bad creature but he’s not as evil as the games make him out he’s just a sadistic monster who hates people or something. I can’t speak to kazuya or sephiroth’s character so I’ll leave it at that
He's a xenolek
    Well, now I'm imagining a tiny Dalek bursting out of someone's chest. Which would admittedly be horrifying as you'd hear a muffled "exterminate" followed by a muffled to not muffled "Ex...ter...mi...." ~explodes out of chest~ "nate"!

Edit: and the whole time of course the guy is screaming his head off while his chest begins glowing brighter and brighter blue.
        Lol I imagine it would be like a Russian doll where the guy bursts out of the dalek and the xeno bursts out the guy
I don't know much about Doctor Who but I thought all Daleks were mutated, then genetically modified and turned into cyborgs?


If so Ridley is basically what they could achieve if they weren't mutated.
    They're not Cyborgs. They're a lifeform that are encased in a battle armor. A mutated Dalek is not a Dalek because it would be deemed imperfect. Daleks are in their eyes the superior lifeform and nothing else is worthy of life.

Pure hatred for anything other than Dalek. They were created through genetic modification but once Dalek they approve of nothing else.

The Daleks were once forced to be recreated by genetically modifying human DNA and their own technology didn't recognize them as Dalek so they had to trick the Doctor into confirming they were Dalek so they could create pure Daleks again.

As soon as the new pure Daleks were created they forced the impure ones to self destruct because they were not Dalek.
        Thanks for the lore. Always love me some lore.
            Heck yeah, lore is life.
Do you have a point you're making here or did you just word your comment weirdly as if you did? I'm not sure what you're trying to say here.
That other m PTSD thing is stupid and you know it. Also I’m pretty sure the reveal trailer was just her being caught off guard considering it ends with her going straight for him.
Yeah and literally sent samus into a fucking PTSD driven shock where she literally begged for someone to kill her because she thought ridley's murder of the whole planet was inevitable
    We don't talk about Other M.
Body count isnt really relevant. We’re talking about fundamental personality. By your logic, Ridley is more evil than Frieza from Dragonball because he just kills for fun, but Frieza has murdered trillions.
Because it apparently feels good to downvote benign video game opinions you don’t agree with lmao.
    Isn't disagreeing like... the point of downvotes?
        Not really. It’s to block out misinformation / hate, unrelated / off-topic discussion, etc. gives the person bad karma and prevents the spread of their post. After a certain number the post gets hidden, etc. If you disagree with someone’s benign opinion you talk about it with them. It’s just that it’s really easy to just downvote so it has become a tool to pile-on, but thats not what it’s really for.

The official word on the purpose of downvotes from Reddit themselves: 

>Vote. If you think something contributes to conversation, upvote it. If you think it does not contribute to the subreddit it is posted in or is off-topic in a particular community, downvote it.

So if someone asks “which villain is the most evil?”, and I say A and you say B, we can talk about it.. no one needs to dowvote because its all on topic lol. If I came in and say “Toyota’s are fantastic cars” then the purpose of a downvote is to hide unrelated posts or offensive posts etc. but people feel better about themselves when they do it apparently. I almost never downvote vote because off topic / offensive stuff is almost always already gone by the time I get in threads.
            I mean, you downvoted literally every opinion I made that disagreed with you lol. So I assumed you were saying you disagreed with me in those situations.
                Oof doesn't look great to be sanctimonious about downvotes but still use them like everyone else 💀 sucks for him I guess
                I did it because everyone was doing it to me lol. So I should correct that, I only senselessly downvote when it’s senselessly done to my on-topic post. Have you seen all my posts on here? I assumed you were doing it to mine. Lol

    That’s what I mean, I haven’t seen anything Tekken 8 related story or character wise yet(other than hearing how Kaz sets up the new tournament) cus I haven’t got a chance to get it yet 😂
        Lol I see. I mean her trailer is already out, so it’s not really a spoiler or anything
Heck yeah, lore is life.
I mean, you downvoted literally every opinion I made that disagreed with you lol. So I assumed you were saying you disagreed with me in those situations.
    Oof doesn't look great to be sanctimonious about downvotes but still use them like everyone else 💀 sucks for him I guess
    I did it because everyone was doing it to me lol. So I should correct that, I only senselessly downvote when it’s senselessly done to my on-topic post. Have you seen all my posts on here? I assumed you were doing it to mine. Lol
Maybe that's the intended use, but the social climate dictates that's just how it be. Not everyone is gonna want to have a civilised discussion, or has the time, so the downvote becomes a good way to express agreement or disagreement with a comment
    Im just answering the question you asked.
Yes, Sephiroth revels in it because he believes it is his divine right. He believes he is exacting moral, righteous vengeance against the people who genocided his ancestors. He’s like the Doom Slayer, who takes pleasure in murdering demons because he believes all of them are evil. They both view their killing and torture as justified and it’s strictly a matter of perspective. 

That is not more evil than someone killing because “fuck yeah evil.” I just like murder, hoo rah. 

Like I don’t know how to make it any more obvious lol. You’re arguing against the very definition of what evil is. At this point I can only assume you’re a big fan of Sephiroth so you **want** him to be the most evil in this situation but you’re actively advocating for Sephiroth to be way edgier and lamer than he actually is.
    You can assume whatever you want, but it’s just a difference of opinion, and we have 3 options based on the OPs prompt, so I could assume the same about you regarding ridley. It’s not like we are discussing every villain in history here. And, “The very definition of evil” is essentially “immorality and wickedness”. I don’t know how to make it more obvious to you that mudering anything and everything that isn’t you and seeking to go do the same throughout the cosmos, and taking pleasure in keeping the tormented souls of millions of people at his whim for no reason other than to be cruel to them, is more evil than someone killing people because they can and enjoy it. That’s 1 rung below sephiroth. And by your same logic, ridley’s moral compass is that he can do what he wants / finds fun. Every character can be simplified in that way.

In fact you literally have a painting of Satan as your avatar. Satan is literally the embodiment of evil and Sephiroth is very heavily based on him (one winged angel?) and their motivations are very similar. you think Ridley is more evil than satan? Lol
Keep coping lmao
whatever u say bruh
    I can almost guarantee you that they are a Sephiroth fanboy who loves the edginess lol
