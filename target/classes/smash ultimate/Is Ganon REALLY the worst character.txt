[[Is Ganon REALLY the worst character]]


Despite every single tier list that exists, I truly find it hard to believe that Ganon belongs at the worst spot. He can kill so fast, and single handedly has the strongest smash attacks in the game. Can someone explain why (in simple terms)


Very slow in almost every movement stat, bottom 3-5 recovery, needs hard reads to get damage, gets comboed almost as hard as DK.
    >gets comboed almost as hard as DK.

DK has Super Armor. Ganondorf has ***negative*** armor, or that's how it feels at least. I hate half of my moves getting stopped by the smallest attack, only for Ganon to be too slow to react.
        Getting stopped by the smallest attack is how the game works. Ganon is just slow
        Dude should have armor on all his B moves and smash attacks
            Also for how long it takes I'd add uptiltÂ 
        Give Doriyah k rool level super armor but on his entire body
    whats interesting is his upb in a vacuum isn't THAT bad of a recovery move. The problem is his air drift and the fact that his double jump is really a stall more than a jump.
    You're talking mad shit for someone within doriyahing distance.
    Nah his recovery is bottom 1 imo
        Tbh I think his is slightly better than docs just because he can actually recover high whereas doc usually canâ€™t.
            Doc can recover high. He can use pills to get a reversal and cover the stage. Doc can recover about the same distance as Ganondorf, except heâ€™s faster and has more mixups.
Ganon main here.

He's incredibly slow in both movement and frame data, being unable to react to quick attacks and unable to catch up to camping. Any type of movement above his level will allow the opponent to camp him out infinitely, if they do choose. Any type of projectile with knock back will do the same thing, allow a zoner to make the Ganon unable to interact, whatsoever. 

Also, because of the speed issue, Ganon can't handle a lot of disjoints. Most disjointed attacks have a maybe hefty startup, like Shulk arials, cloud arials, sora, marth, but because ganondorf can't move fast enough to approach someone during an attack startup, these characters can essentially make every interaction unbeatable, either trades or just a straight up hit for the swordie. He really just relies on you to make a mistake to capitalize on, but obviously that rarely happens
    Marth slow aerials??? Have you looked at the frame data??
        Yeah Marth doesn't really fit there, I could have put like Dedede or Seph or something.

Incidentally, I love the Marth matchup cause Marth is all about endlag for his aerials, and with no projectiles it's a fun boxing match for Ganon. Marth can kill at like 50 but it's one of his better MUs lmao
            What u mean "all about endlag"? All of his aerials are very safe on shield
I feel like in the wild (elite smash), there is no worst character. I have seen plenty of Ganons in the 14 mil range. At the professional level everyone knows how to punish him but online you can make anything work
    Whenever I talk to my buddy about good or bad characters he hits me with the best knowledge we can ever hope for.

He tells me to shut up. Because at our level it doesn't matter who's considered good or bad. And that's even true for online, or elite smash. Especially with the latency. 

Tier lists only matter to the absolute upper echelon of players. I'm not even talking about tournament regulars. I'm talking about top 8 regulars.
        Tier list are kinda dumb to the common player too because carried characters exist who arenâ€™t necessarily high tier but if you donâ€™t know the specific counter play the matchup is much harder than it should be.
        I play Bowser who is a mid-tier and gets comboed pretty hard but still manages well due to his high speed and high combo potential. This is why I like Ultimate; I feel like at the lower levels, ANYONE is good. You can win with any character.
        Tier list are kinda dumb to the common player too because carried characters exist who arenâ€™t necessarily high tier but if you donâ€™t know the specific counter play the matchup is much harder than it should be.
        Even still not entirely top 8! I've got a ganondorf buddy teaching me to play the big man himself who consistently makes top 3 at our fairly stacked local :) brings a tear to my eye every time I watch him play
            I meant more top 8 at majors
                It used to be this way, tiers definitely still matter a ton by at least top 32, thereâ€™s just way too many good players nowadays
        It kind of depends. I play a lot of characters and itâ€™s really obvious to me which ones just have worse tools. Ganon and Dr Mario get gimped by the most random shit. Then I go play Samus and itâ€™s so easy to live and I can deal with other peoples bullshit so much easier.

I think itâ€™s just about how you want to play the game and how much effort you want to put in for results.

For example my two cents

Low effort and can be played successfully - Bowser and Krool.

High Effort and you still get punished Â - ganandorf and dr MarioÂ 
        There is clearly a difference between Marth and Aegis at anything above a less than 200 hour levelÂ 
    That makes a lot of sense. I'm mostly referring to online anyway cuz that's what I play most, and I just get demolished by them lol. Elite smash as well. I guess it just shows how unskilled a random online elite smash player can be compared to a professional. They make ganon look so easy to beat.
        Ganon is only bad at the top level where people make less mistakes. At the low-mid level he's a lot better since he s easy to pick up and people make more mistakes against you. Sheik is by far a better character but the overwhelming majority of people would perform better with Ganon since he's so simple.
            i would say even at mid level he already drops to pretty fucking bad.
                Maybe. But someone like nairos Ganon would stomp almost any other player who isnt a top player. I do think mid level Ganon takes more skill to win with tho.

    Yep tier lists apply to top level competition. So people get confused, since we aren't top pros who understand the game at that level
    A character that requires the opponent to play poorly and make mistakes is a bad character.

Add to that a bad disadvantage state and you have Ganondorf.

Of course a player significantly more skilled at the game can make him work against a less skilled player. But they have to work so much harder for it.
    Thatâ€˜s because of the online â€žslackâ€œ.

Itâ€˜s really wearing you down getting matched-up with people whose internetstats make the screen freeze secondly.
        Itâ€™s not even online, itâ€™s just the skill of the overall playerbase. Go to a weekly and play whoever you enjoy and youâ€™ll do fine.
Yes he is. He is slow in every aspect except killing, his recovery is linear and easily edgeguardable, and his game plan is easily exploited by faster characters. If you have any questions ask.
    I agree he's pretty bad. But, surely there's another character that is worse? For a character with relatively abundant kill confirms, it can't be that they belong as the SINGLE handedly worst character. Personally, I'd throw Robin and Min min under him.
        Youâ€¦.obviously havenâ€™t fought a good Min Min. 

God bless your naive soul. Your life is far better than those of us that understand the true horrorâ€¦

Look up Doramigi on YouTube and youâ€™ll get the best idea of how this character is operated at a top level.
            being ledge trapped by a character on the other side of the stage with 2 smash attacks with 1 can even cover the stage above u 

yeahhhhhh, that b\*tch is A+ to S tier
                Forget A+ there's no way min min isn't top 10
                     well, I normally list S tiers at top3 in my chart so, yeah, I think I can squeeze min min in top5 even, behind only steve, joker, rob, sonic (just my opinion thou, but kaz come after min min)

 don't cancel me pls :)
                        Valid opinion on the ranking but I don't think a tier of just 3 would be good design because there's not that much of a gap
                             yeah, true, but I feel like steve, sonic, rob dominates the meta so much that they deserve on another tier list like ss (maybe adding joker and min min makes better design thou on second thought) 

other "S" tier characters like cloud, G&W, kazuya, terry is like rlly strong but I don't feel their dominance in my local region. IG I haven't ran into a really good one yet but my own experience greatly influences my tier list making
            As a Doc main, a bad Min Min devastates me.

Unless I'm far superior in every which way to them, I lose badly. Doc just has no tools against Min Min
        Saying that Min Min is bad is CRAZY and even more considering that Ganon vs Min Min is probably one of the worst matchups in the whole game
        ðŸ‘€
There's so much about the comment.
What kill confirms?
And have you ever played against  a min min or robin?
            This. This is the craziest take. I respect it.
            Basically his entire moveset is comprised of kill confirms. But for one, down throw into neutral air, dash attack into neutral air, honestly neutral air EVERYTIME. And yes, I've fought against plenty of min mins and Robin's, and I've never once lost to them like I have with Ganon. You could say its a skill issue, but there's something more going on.
                Those kill confirms arenâ€™t kill confirms. They donâ€™t work on high percents. And I see why you struggle with Ganondorf. You play Lucario, and Lucario is a featherweight, and has a mechanic that makes him stronger at higher percents so he hates dying early. And no, there isnâ€™t a character with a worse combination of traits, because they all have a redeeming factor.
                    lucario i thought was mid 80s weight? which is light but not featherweight iirc. Im getting the impression that OP is quite young based on their comments this thread.
                        I played Lucario a bit and he does very early
                        Thatâ€™s extremely light
                            the range is 62 to 135. And i was wrong anyway, his weight is 92, which is like lower mid.

edit: in fact, that is steves weight
                Neutral air is hardly a kill move unless you're at ledge or off stage and at the percents it does kill it def won't be comboing with down throw and dash attack would prolly kill before that. Most characters have a lot of kill confirms but not many have GOOD kill confirms there's a difference between ganon down throw RAR bair and Roy/chrom jab RAR bair. Partially because of how risk free it is to throw out a jab compress to a grab but also because ganon is slow as shit. Even if he had Mythra down tilt into up smash he'd still be shit because he doesn't have any antizoning tools, he's got a huge hit box and once again is slow as shit. These are problems that min min or robing don't even have to consider
        Bro has been fighting level 1 Min Min CPUs.
        You're kidding about min min right? She's widely accepted as an amazing character. I agree she's not as good as a lot of people make her out to be but shes not even comparable to mid tiers, let alone contenders for overall worst character.
        You had me until quote Robin. And Min Min, who obviously is high tier.
        hes not as good at killing as he first appears. Alot of things he does fall apart offline against players that know how is setups work.
He is

Slow AF, Horrible recovery, Combo food, Terrible frame data, has no projectiles, all of these just resulted in being projectile camped, poor neutral and abysmal disadvantage state. Despite being a heavyweight, Ganonâ€™s survivability is comparable to lightweights just because of how easy it is to edge guard him

Little Mac is the 2nd worst character, but at least he has excellent mobility, much better frame data, and while his recovery is just as bad, at least his side b doesnâ€™t send him to free fall like Ganon, so I would say that Little Mac is still significantly better than Ganon
    Little Mac is not the second worst character. Bottom 4 at worst.
        Yeah, Peanut has shown some respect on Little Mac.

His recovery isn't as bad as we first thought, since he has 3 resources: Side-B, Down Air stall, Up-B ~~still bad but like, look at Doc and Ganondorf~~

His combo and damage is actually kind of insane, with some nasty true combos, kill set ups, edgeguarding and incredible frame data, plus armor. Then there's ladder combos, platform tech chases that straight up lead to KO...
    flame choke into tilt punt is the best combo in the game it's factually correct
        Not a true combo
            Don't gotta be
                It does at mid-high level play. Teching flame choke isn't hard even online, and then your combo isn't a combo anymore
                    If I ever see those players I will let you know, too busy goonin ðŸ˜Ž
    Little Mac isn't 2nd worst, poor Doc Mario takes that cake. Basically all the same issues as Ganondorf but he has a projectile! And a reflector! 

aaaand uh the worst recovery in the game and roughly x.72 the movement stats of Mario.
-Terrible recovery, neutral game, and disadvantage stage.


-Heâ€™s combo food.


-His frame data and mobility are abysmally slow.


-He has virtually no answers to projectile camping and is horrible at approaching. He also lacks a projectile of his own.


-He has no good out of shield options, which is crucial for a heavyweight to have.


-His overalls attack range ainâ€™t all that great aside from his smash attacks, meaning that he can easily get stuffed out by large disjoints.


-He has no reliable kill throws, which is odd because youâ€™d think a powerhouse like himself would have 3, but no. In fact, Falconâ€™s throws are all stronger than his.


-His specials range from usable (Side Special and Down Special), to situational (Up Special) to just straight up useless (Neutral Special).


-He has the single worst up tilt in the game.
    Ganons up b out of shield is pretty good, except for the fact that 70% of the cast low profiles it and itâ€™s not reliable for that reason. A lot of the time even when Iâ€™m hit by a move that is unsafe Iâ€™ll just opt to jump or roll back instead of risking the low profile bs.
Idk and Idc. He's fun
My experience with ganon as a lifelong ganon main is as a gatekeeper to elite smash. I'm not super good at the game, I can't beat good players most of the time but I can handle my own online.

If you can beat my \~elite smash range ganon, you deserve the pass. I am the gatekeeper.
    Ganon is the ultimate bad-decision-eliminator tool out there. Every bad decision you make = minus one stock.
        He's perfect ðŸ‘Œ
    And this is why we love our boy
Is he bad? Yes. But did light lose a major to him? Also yes.
Doesnâ€™t pyra have better smash attacks tho?
    She does.
        Idk what the op is on ganons smashes feel like sneezes compared to pyras, thereâ€™s other characters with better ones too I think
            Oh yeah, Ganondorf doesn't have any top 5 strongest smash attacks. F smash and up smash are actually just both weaker versions of Ike's f and up smash
                It's the reverse. Ganon's is a better version of those smash attacks. It's still not enough to salvage him.
                    I looked it up, turns out Ike's are slower, have more knockback, but do less damage
Tier lists only matter to an elite few where optimal play is the norm. The vast majority of casual and lightly-competitive players are not going to play at that level.
    Seems like when tier disparity is as high as it is in Smult, you can feel the weaknesses of the bottom tiers at much lower levels of play than in more tightly balanced games. Ganon's shortcomings become an issue basically as soon as the people you're fighting learn how to edgeguard.
        I think it's the opposite, actually - Lower level play opens the game up to tactics which wouldn't work against optimal play, but is extremely effective otherwise. Ganon has a big psych-game which tends to intimidate opponents who know they can get killed by an errant Fsmash. High level players aren't fazed by this in the way low to mid level players are.
            I've never known a low level player to get psyched out by danger; those motherfuckers are unconditionable and have no regard for their own lives, and playing that kind of risk/reward meta is usually more stack than they can juggle. Like, I can see how there _could_ be a mindgame there, but by the time the players get to that point, they're already competent enough to just stuff his recovery and disrespect his stage presence. Even if you give him space and time to work, Ganon doesn't really have the tools to apply pressure that doesn't lose to mashing unless you're seriously outplaying your opponent.
Mobility is insanely important in every smash game. That's why Ganon and Zelda are always bad
     at least zelda can camp and have virtually non punishable recovery
        My point wasn't that Zelda is worse than Ganon by any means, just that similar to ganon her lack of mobility will always render her a pretty bad character at least
             true, but both of them are hella fun to play casual
                Trust me I feel you lol I've been a Zelda main since melee because of how much I love sweetspot fair/bair and ganon has always been one of my top secondaries because he's so much stupid fun
                    landing a sweet spotted fair/bair or ledge trap them to death as zelda is soo much fun

too bad I am not good at landing sweet spot and camping so zelda isn't the best option for me

I still play zelda w my friends thou

  
As for gannon, a turn around warlock punch catching roll feels better than nuttin fr
    I definitely think Zelda is the best she's ever been in Ultimate (i.e. not bottom 5) as while her mobility kinda sucks, her projectile game got upgraded substansially in Ultimate which allows her to get in more easily
        I don't think anyone could argue against Ult Zelda being the best version of the character ever. Previously it was a toss up between Melee and Smash 4 but in both of those games she was really really bad (and we don't talk about Brawl Zelda)

In Ult she is a viable character with (imo) a handful of winning matchups vs some high/top tiers. She just has a few too many matchups against prominent characters where she loses HARD so she's still low tier
            As a Zelda main myself, I definitely agree with this.
    I mean, thatâ€™s not entirely true.

Just look at Steve and Snake. Those 2 characters have some of the worst mobility in the game, yet are still seen as the best characters in the game. It mostly boils down to how good their normals are and how polarizing their projectiles, camping, and neutral is.
Objectively looking at the attacks and data he is the worst

>!but I always lose to him!<
Oh yeah. Heâ€™s only good against people who donâ€™t know how to take advantage of his slow laggy moves and arguably the worst recovery in the game.
Still don't know why they didn't give Ganon tough guy, but they'll give it to Kazuya and Bowser, who are already insanely good.
Yes.
he has a completely useless move in up-tilt, a terrible recovery due to poor air speed and a lack of mixup options, no projectiles, and his only real disjoints are on laggy, easy-to-punish smash attacks. his best moves are aerials and tilts, too. i don't know what character you could argue is worse

in the next game, they could buff his speed to make ganondorf a much better juggler and give his dash attack more starting + vertical knockback, letting him pop enemies up, beat them around with his aerials, and punish a bad airdodge with a smash attack
If youâ€™re playing against someone competent at the game theres really nothing ganon can do to not get gimped when recovering
Yes. Most smash players will probably never realize it, but Ganondorf is a horrible character in almost all facets except damage and knockback. 

In casuals, he will be alright. Relatively good players will make Ganon seem great and unbeatable but make no mistake, it is because they are indeed better players; but when it comes to facing actual great players, he crumbles and cannot accomplish anything against most other characters when they are well piloted.
Yeah he is. But he only becomes weak when players start really trying. If people are just goofing around not playing serious he doesn't seem so bad.
No, he's not. 



Pro tip: stop listening to people who devoted their entire lives to a single video game. Those people are likely to be shit at having fun and or living in general.
Yee he is. Heâ€™s insanely slow both interms of ground/air speed and in terms of frame data so pretty much every character in the game can both camp him and out box him at the same time. He also has probably the worst recovery in the game.
I mean, a lot tier lists are subjective. Even though statistically Ganondorf loses almost all matchups, It really depends on Ganonâ€™s skill relative to his opponent.
He has decent moves but problem is they're on him. His speed, recovery, air mobility, and basically everything else about him are bottom 5. 

Incin is slower but he makes up for it by having ALL of his moves be really good and he has that bullshit factor he's known for.
Cuz people arenâ€™t generally good at the game like they think they are ðŸ˜‚
Yes, but depends
Heâ€™s the worst but the worst character in Smash Ultimate is still pretty ok
Yes

You have to play a lobotomised patient to win with him
He is *fun*, butâ€¦ he is slow. And easy to destroy. If you get him off the stage itâ€™s over, pretty much over.


Unless you can get some good reads.
Then you can completely end someoneâ€™s career.
Ganon is pretty slow and thats gonna make it harder for him to land any hits. Not to mention his recovery is bottom 3.
Gdorf most likely is the worst character for offline "competitive" 1v1s because of his poor horizontal aerial mobility and exploitable recovery. However some of his frame data isn't bad so he can be very threatening once he gets in and especially when he corners opponents near an edge, but he also needs good reads to be generally effective and worth using.
That damage means jack if you're combo food
Letâ€™s think of it this way, does Ganon win any matchups? Is there any character that struggles to deal with Ganon?
I would say yes because he's one of the slowest characters in the game. I always question myself, why is he just Captain Falcon? He's not from F-zero, he's from Zelda which is a different game series. But honestly, the Zelda characters are a bad representation of their games. Ganondorf will always be the worst character and a bad representation from his game series.
I don't think so :(
Yes.
Paulina is the worst!!
Does not have the strongest smash attacks in the game, I thought he did too until I saw some other videos.

If I find them again I'll link them

https://youtu.be/qMlwF2-DEcI?si=e0p3KChS2u3Vpf0P

Gannon wins in killpower for just his nair.

He does get top 5 for a lot of categories, but almost never first, so I see where your claim comes from and if we are ignoring technicalities, yeah he's got top 5% power on tons of his kit.
Ganon only works when he punishes blunders.


He is functionally incapable of doing anything outside of that.


Since tier lists are made for the uppermost echelons, where blunders cannot be expected to occur with consistent regularity, Ganon suffers.


Someone who is merely okay at the game is more likely to blunder and therefore struggle against a Ganon.


In active games, tier lists are highly volatile wrt elo as player reaction speeds matter.


The only games with constent tiering for all elo would be like turnbased combat games because those end up being stat comparisons and stat comparisons only. Human element not involved.
smash is kinda balanced so the "worst" may be still viable, given that your skill is better than the other player

remember, never underestimate gannon in laggy gsp online
I know a Ganon main and he beats my ass every time we play. Probably a skill issue on my part, but still.
If you get hit by ganon ever, its your fault. So yes hes the worst character.
He will always be top tier in my heart ~~and whenever I play against him~~
yup
All Ganandorf players play the same or try to do the same plays. The character is so slow that all you have to do to beat them is not to run into his attacks and punish all his attempts of winning Neutral.
It depends where you play him, he is terrible in a competitive setting (and tier list are based around the competitive scene) but good/ok in a casual setting (but most characters are viable in that setting)
No
He's got some crazy damage but he's slower than dirt. If you've got a fast fighter with some decent damage you'll automatically outpace him.
He doesn't have a single winning matchup. His whole game plan is to keep throwing out his slow hit boxes and hope the opponent is foolish enough to run into them xD Now, this is smash ultimate, you can win with any fighter (people would be crazy to say a fighter that can end your stock in four hits is bad), but everyone is still better than Ganon. He's not bad, just the least good, haha
His recovery is absolute ASS!
He's the worst only at higher level.

For most players, he is not the worst, even in elite smash, he's not that bad until higher levels.

So for the vast majority of players, he is not the worst.
If his movement was better he wouldnâ€™t be, but he has so many bad matchups that he rly is. Sooo many characters can beat ganon by just using good spacing lol
I wish so bad he wasnâ€™t for once
Yes.
For professionals, yes he is. For amateurs (like myself) he's amazing though.
Yes
Being able to hit hard doesn't matter much when most characters can put you in the blender with their weaker moves anyways.Â 


You also have to rely on hard reads or stray hits as a slow character since you have like 2-3 combos total and they only work at low percents while tons of characters have actual combos and kill confirms.
hes just too fucking slow
The most antagonist Nintendo character, yes.
The most powerful character, yes.
The slowest character in ground and air, yes.
If you are playing at an actual tournament then absolutely yes he is the worstâ€¦ but if you are hanging out with friends and playing he is the best character in the game.
Imo he's amazing as a read heavy character. You don't play the matchup, you play the other person

Do they roll a lot? DOORIYAH. Do they always jump from ledge? DOORIYAH. 

Just, pros lab and practice so much that you'll rarely get away with it against them
Here is the thing:

Why play Ganon, when you can play Falcon?
Every tier list is fairly subjective. Theyâ€™re mostly made by high level players who compete in championship level tournaments and itâ€™s mostly based off who wins the most consistently. Just because ganon is widely considered to worst in the game doesnâ€™t mean thereâ€™s not someone out there who could rock your s**t with him. He might be slow, that doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s impossible to beat fast characters at him. If youâ€™re a god a reading and predicting your opponents moves ganon could be much higher with his insane hill power and tankiess. Smash just isnâ€™t really a game where tier lists can be objectively right. My tier list as a casual player would be widely different than a pros based on me and my friends gameplay. Just for example King K Rool for the longest time was the bane of my existence, heâ€™s got a super fast counter/reflect, heâ€™s relatively quick, has a great recovery and is good at edge guarding. Yet most tier lists would have him fairly low because of how often you donâ€™t see him played in tournaments since a lot of pros just donâ€™t get results. 

So to answer your question, no. I donâ€™t think ganon can be called worst in the game because everyoneâ€™s play style and group they play with is wildly different and every player has their own strengths and weaknesses with characters
Heâ€™s definitely the worst character in the game but I think unless youâ€™re playing at an INCREDIBLY high level, the consequences of that wonâ€™t be impossible to remedy through playing well, so yeha just play who you like :>
Someone tell me if Iâ€™m crazy, Ganon was WAY better at the start of the gameâ€™s lifespan compared to now. I didnâ€™t play him much as the DLC came out and I found interest in other characters but I remember him being stupid good on launch.
    people simply figured him out and the meta shifted to a far more defensive one
Heâ€™s bad but heâ€™s one hell of a matchup check. If youâ€™re arenâ€™t ready he will make quick work of your stocks
I've seen a lot of videos where people troll as him, owning a lot of online matches. Which really solidifies how player skill matters more than a tier list.
He is and one of my brothers friends main him he is really slow because he belongs to the heavy characters category like King K.
Idk... I do pretty well with him
i don't think he is, but that's whats popular to say.

ganon has so much stock kill potential, hits hard, and can punish hard with good reads. he does have terrible recovery and easy to gimp off stage but every character in this game has bad things for them too.
yes
Sadly yes slow movement on the ground and air bad frame rate and lag can't help but feel bad for him

So slow. Bad recovery. Easy to Gimp. Is comboed SUPER HARD.
No he's clearly the best character in the game by a longshot, as shown by his enormous amount of damage and agility.
Y E S
Bear in mind, tier lists are based around the highest level of play by professional level players. For most people and characters tiers donâ€™t matter until you start to get exponentially better, so for most casual to mid skill levels Ganonâ€™s obscene damage per hit makes him much better, especially as combos are shorter at lower levels of play and people are less likely to try and stop your recovery.

With that said yes he is unfortunately the worst. I love playing as him, but yeah heâ€™s just not good at high levels.
Its really crazy that you think min min is worse than ganon
Man is the bottom of the barrel and any goods worst night.are at the same time
I think there's an argument for Dr Mario either being worse or so close they're almost even but yeah ganon doesn't have the tools to be a good character. Also he doesn't have the strongest smash attacks. Byleth, pyra, and kazuya off the top of my head are stronger. They are strong don't get me wrong but they aren't the strongest. And unlike pyra and kazuya ganon doesn't have reliable confirms into them.
Depends on the character you're playing against
Best explanation I can think of is that all of his attributes are either one of the best or one of the worst. When a character has this level of extremes, the strong points arenâ€™t enough to make up for the horrendous performance in other areas.

And to top it all off, I donâ€™t think Ganondorf is even first place in anything. Heâ€™s evidently only just outperformed at being the best at things and at being the worst at things.
My brother played as him and whooped my a**.
Ganondorf has no moves that need to be respected. If you donâ€™t respect him, you win because really ganon has nothing thatâ€™s actually scary thatâ€™s not avoidable. Yes, his smash attacks are strong but they are easy to punish if you just shield.
Yes but the game is super balanced so a good ganon can still beat the shit out of top tier scum like me
Doesnâ€™t matter how strong he is if he canâ€™t hit anything, movement speed always beats the tank characters in meta/competitive
Idk, our recent local tournaments have been won by a Ganon main so personallyâ€¦.no, I donâ€™t think heâ€™s the worst
Unfortunately he is just too slow. And his recovery is ass. And it doesnâ€™t even work well as an out of shield. Love Ganon for the hard call outs. But heâ€™s simply. The worst character in the game
yeah he sucks
Idk it depends.  He's always been slow but I e rocked mainly do and ganondorf since melee and gosh dang do I make slow characters fast.  Love my dorf
No, and neither is Little Mac. They're both No skill characters. Allowing for quick rise in low-upper mid rank, but not really allowing you to get much further
I give him an edge over little Mac
Not really imo. He can kill you at 40 and has the damage output to take you there in like one neutral interaction. Most people will try to say that he has stupidly slow hotboxes and to that I say lemme introduce jab, ftilt, dtilt, Nair, bair, up air, and upb are all moves that come out freakishly fast and deal such hefty damage which can mostly be comboed into by 2 of his THREE grabs, THREEE, grabs are attacks that literally ignore shield and if theyre command grabs, youre not mashing out of them. The fact that ganon literally has a bottom tier to himself in the "official" smash tier list genuinely pisses me off because there is no way that he is any worse than the various characters that you have to break your fingers with to deal good damage. Ganon player press one button and boom they instantly have a 50% damage lead. But noooo the meta is dominated by characters who's optimal playstyle is to not play the game so ganon is "so bad" because he isn't built for camping.
Only in pro, every where else heâ€™s feared lol
Heâ€™s just slow. I hating using ganon but at the same time I main Young Link so itâ€™s 2 completely different spectrums
DORIYAH
**Someone** has to be the worst. Every other character has shown many things that Ganondorf can barely dream of.
As someone who doesn't believe in the Meta, I do feel like Ganon isn't really the best to play as.

He's really slow and heavy and he's really not the best for combos.
     u are a falco main o it must be sastifying to do uptilts on him
Nah tbh it's gotta be mii swordfighter
    Love my character with the fakest confirms in the game :'(

Still fun to play though
        I learned how to play em cause I, like a fool, thought they would add a hollow knight deluxe skin for mii swordie ðŸ™ƒ
            I played them because one of my friends was casually playing them as a joke and they wanted me to try them out, I realized I really liked them and spent a while working on them and I actually took my first tournament set using them (it was at an invitational for various north carolina universities) which motivated me to keep going with them. Then I played dmc and immediately got the Dante skin for them.

A year and a half later, I feel like I've figured out almost everything they have to offer (much of which I've figured out by myself by playing against better people) and I've realized I should finally stop seriously playing them to either solo main Incineroar or work on young link (whose kit translates shockingly well with what I've learned from swordfighter). Whatever happens, it was a fun trip, and I plan on updating [the video I made for them](https://youtu.be/HCiLaqOTT20?si=rrRCC6BRBFrxrr9F) as a sort of last hurrah.
As others have stated before, tier lists only really apply to top level play. Take some of the top Ganon players, the top Dr Mario's, little macs, Isabelles, DDDs, whoever you consider to be a "bad" or "low tier" and send them to one of your locals and I guarantee they will absolutely clean house. Yes, Ganondorf has his bad traits. Some will even say those traits make him unviable, but good players know how to get around these and take advantage of his strengths. They're playing you, not the characters on screen. A more accurate statement would be Ganon has the lowest amount of potential compared to others.
Definitely horrible, but imo the worst character is Rosa and Luma.
Ike is worse.
Because he is slow, counters rape him, and he is easy to edge camp. Not the worst imo though
Ganondorf main propaganda. He rocks. Iâ€™m so tired of this lie that he is a bad character.
    Heâ€™s awesome, but heâ€™s also the worst character in the game. Those arenâ€™t mutually exclusive.
        You smoking crack lmao
No. People just use him wrong and refuse to practice him.
    Top level players use him wrong?
        Correct. They donâ€™t use him because theyâ€™re scared of his frame data
            Honestly I have no clue how ganon would in any world match characters like Steve, Sonic and Rob.
He only is if the only thing you think that matters about this game is competitive or (ðŸ¤¢ðŸ¤¢) "professional" stats and opinions
    Which is indeed the point of a tier list.
        Tier lists discuss who is played the most too
            Thereâ€™s also tier lists out there for which characters have the best feet in the game but that doesnâ€™t make it relevant to OPâ€™s question.
    Even with items and final smashes heâ€™s not that amazing. No reflector, slow as hell to run to items. Final smash hits hard but its no Zelda. Probably gets higher in the tierlist than Dr Mario though due to final smash diff.

Looking at what the best character is is inherently competitive, so no wonder most of the tierlists are for competitive smash. Also the tiers change so much with different rules and the competitive ruleset is the most standard one.
>gets comboed almost as hard as DK.

DK has Super Armor. Ganondorf has ***negative*** armor, or that's how it feels at least. I hate half of my moves getting stopped by the smallest attack, only for Ganon to be too slow to react.
    Getting stopped by the smallest attack is how the game works. Ganon is just slow
    Dude should have armor on all his B moves and smash attacks
        Also for how long it takes I'd add uptiltÂ 
    Give Doriyah k rool level super armor but on his entire body
whats interesting is his upb in a vacuum isn't THAT bad of a recovery move. The problem is his air drift and the fact that his double jump is really a stall more than a jump.
You're talking mad shit for someone within doriyahing distance.
Nah his recovery is bottom 1 imo
    Tbh I think his is slightly better than docs just because he can actually recover high whereas doc usually canâ€™t.
        Doc can recover high. He can use pills to get a reversal and cover the stage. Doc can recover about the same distance as Ganondorf, except heâ€™s faster and has more mixups.
Marth slow aerials??? Have you looked at the frame data??
    Yeah Marth doesn't really fit there, I could have put like Dedede or Seph or something.

Incidentally, I love the Marth matchup cause Marth is all about endlag for his aerials, and with no projectiles it's a fun boxing match for Ganon. Marth can kill at like 50 but it's one of his better MUs lmao
        What u mean "all about endlag"? All of his aerials are very safe on shield
Whenever I talk to my buddy about good or bad characters he hits me with the best knowledge we can ever hope for.

He tells me to shut up. Because at our level it doesn't matter who's considered good or bad. And that's even true for online, or elite smash. Especially with the latency. 

Tier lists only matter to the absolute upper echelon of players. I'm not even talking about tournament regulars. I'm talking about top 8 regulars.
    Tier list are kinda dumb to the common player too because carried characters exist who arenâ€™t necessarily high tier but if you donâ€™t know the specific counter play the matchup is much harder than it should be.
    I play Bowser who is a mid-tier and gets comboed pretty hard but still manages well due to his high speed and high combo potential. This is why I like Ultimate; I feel like at the lower levels, ANYONE is good. You can win with any character.
    Tier list are kinda dumb to the common player too because carried characters exist who arenâ€™t necessarily high tier but if you donâ€™t know the specific counter play the matchup is much harder than it should be.
    Even still not entirely top 8! I've got a ganondorf buddy teaching me to play the big man himself who consistently makes top 3 at our fairly stacked local :) brings a tear to my eye every time I watch him play
        I meant more top 8 at majors
            It used to be this way, tiers definitely still matter a ton by at least top 32, thereâ€™s just way too many good players nowadays
    It kind of depends. I play a lot of characters and itâ€™s really obvious to me which ones just have worse tools. Ganon and Dr Mario get gimped by the most random shit. Then I go play Samus and itâ€™s so easy to live and I can deal with other peoples bullshit so much easier.

I think itâ€™s just about how you want to play the game and how much effort you want to put in for results.

For example my two cents

Low effort and can be played successfully - Bowser and Krool.

High Effort and you still get punished Â - ganandorf and dr MarioÂ 
    There is clearly a difference between Marth and Aegis at anything above a less than 200 hour levelÂ 
That makes a lot of sense. I'm mostly referring to online anyway cuz that's what I play most, and I just get demolished by them lol. Elite smash as well. I guess it just shows how unskilled a random online elite smash player can be compared to a professional. They make ganon look so easy to beat.
    Ganon is only bad at the top level where people make less mistakes. At the low-mid level he's a lot better since he s easy to pick up and people make more mistakes against you. Sheik is by far a better character but the overwhelming majority of people would perform better with Ganon since he's so simple.
        i would say even at mid level he already drops to pretty fucking bad.
            Maybe. But someone like nairos Ganon would stomp almost any other player who isnt a top player. I do think mid level Ganon takes more skill to win with tho.

Yep tier lists apply to top level competition. So people get confused, since we aren't top pros who understand the game at that level
A character that requires the opponent to play poorly and make mistakes is a bad character.

Add to that a bad disadvantage state and you have Ganondorf.

Of course a player significantly more skilled at the game can make him work against a less skilled player. But they have to work so much harder for it.
Thatâ€˜s because of the online â€žslackâ€œ.

Itâ€˜s really wearing you down getting matched-up with people whose internetstats make the screen freeze secondly.
    Itâ€™s not even online, itâ€™s just the skill of the overall playerbase. Go to a weekly and play whoever you enjoy and youâ€™ll do fine.
I agree he's pretty bad. But, surely there's another character that is worse? For a character with relatively abundant kill confirms, it can't be that they belong as the SINGLE handedly worst character. Personally, I'd throw Robin and Min min under him.
    Youâ€¦.obviously havenâ€™t fought a good Min Min. 

God bless your naive soul. Your life is far better than those of us that understand the true horrorâ€¦

Look up Doramigi on YouTube and youâ€™ll get the best idea of how this character is operated at a top level.
        being ledge trapped by a character on the other side of the stage with 2 smash attacks with 1 can even cover the stage above u 

yeahhhhhh, that b\*tch is A+ to S tier
            Forget A+ there's no way min min isn't top 10
                 well, I normally list S tiers at top3 in my chart so, yeah, I think I can squeeze min min in top5 even, behind only steve, joker, rob, sonic (just my opinion thou, but kaz come after min min)

 don't cancel me pls :)
                    Valid opinion on the ranking but I don't think a tier of just 3 would be good design because there's not that much of a gap
                         yeah, true, but I feel like steve, sonic, rob dominates the meta so much that they deserve on another tier list like ss (maybe adding joker and min min makes better design thou on second thought) 

other "S" tier characters like cloud, G&W, kazuya, terry is like rlly strong but I don't feel their dominance in my local region. IG I haven't ran into a really good one yet but my own experience greatly influences my tier list making
        As a Doc main, a bad Min Min devastates me.

Unless I'm far superior in every which way to them, I lose badly. Doc just has no tools against Min Min
    Saying that Min Min is bad is CRAZY and even more considering that Ganon vs Min Min is probably one of the worst matchups in the whole game
    ðŸ‘€
There's so much about the comment.
What kill confirms?
And have you ever played against  a min min or robin?
        This. This is the craziest take. I respect it.
        Basically his entire moveset is comprised of kill confirms. But for one, down throw into neutral air, dash attack into neutral air, honestly neutral air EVERYTIME. And yes, I've fought against plenty of min mins and Robin's, and I've never once lost to them like I have with Ganon. You could say its a skill issue, but there's something more going on.
            Those kill confirms arenâ€™t kill confirms. They donâ€™t work on high percents. And I see why you struggle with Ganondorf. You play Lucario, and Lucario is a featherweight, and has a mechanic that makes him stronger at higher percents so he hates dying early. And no, there isnâ€™t a character with a worse combination of traits, because they all have a redeeming factor.
                lucario i thought was mid 80s weight? which is light but not featherweight iirc. Im getting the impression that OP is quite young based on their comments this thread.
                    I played Lucario a bit and he does very early
                    Thatâ€™s extremely light
                        the range is 62 to 135. And i was wrong anyway, his weight is 92, which is like lower mid.

edit: in fact, that is steves weight
            Neutral air is hardly a kill move unless you're at ledge or off stage and at the percents it does kill it def won't be comboing with down throw and dash attack would prolly kill before that. Most characters have a lot of kill confirms but not many have GOOD kill confirms there's a difference between ganon down throw RAR bair and Roy/chrom jab RAR bair. Partially because of how risk free it is to throw out a jab compress to a grab but also because ganon is slow as shit. Even if he had Mythra down tilt into up smash he'd still be shit because he doesn't have any antizoning tools, he's got a huge hit box and once again is slow as shit. These are problems that min min or robing don't even have to consider
    Bro has been fighting level 1 Min Min CPUs.
    You're kidding about min min right? She's widely accepted as an amazing character. I agree she's not as good as a lot of people make her out to be but shes not even comparable to mid tiers, let alone contenders for overall worst character.
    You had me until quote Robin. And Min Min, who obviously is high tier.
    hes not as good at killing as he first appears. Alot of things he does fall apart offline against players that know how is setups work.
Little Mac is not the second worst character. Bottom 4 at worst.
    Yeah, Peanut has shown some respect on Little Mac.

His recovery isn't as bad as we first thought, since he has 3 resources: Side-B, Down Air stall, Up-B ~~still bad but like, look at Doc and Ganondorf~~

His combo and damage is actually kind of insane, with some nasty true combos, kill set ups, edgeguarding and incredible frame data, plus armor. Then there's ladder combos, platform tech chases that straight up lead to KO...
flame choke into tilt punt is the best combo in the game it's factually correct
    Not a true combo
        Don't gotta be
            It does at mid-high level play. Teching flame choke isn't hard even online, and then your combo isn't a combo anymore
                If I ever see those players I will let you know, too busy goonin ðŸ˜Ž
Little Mac isn't 2nd worst, poor Doc Mario takes that cake. Basically all the same issues as Ganondorf but he has a projectile! And a reflector! 

aaaand uh the worst recovery in the game and roughly x.72 the movement stats of Mario.
Ganons up b out of shield is pretty good, except for the fact that 70% of the cast low profiles it and itâ€™s not reliable for that reason. A lot of the time even when Iâ€™m hit by a move that is unsafe Iâ€™ll just opt to jump or roll back instead of risking the low profile bs.
Ganon is the ultimate bad-decision-eliminator tool out there. Every bad decision you make = minus one stock.
    He's perfect ðŸ‘Œ
And this is why we love our boy
She does.
    Idk what the op is on ganons smashes feel like sneezes compared to pyras, thereâ€™s other characters with better ones too I think
        Oh yeah, Ganondorf doesn't have any top 5 strongest smash attacks. F smash and up smash are actually just both weaker versions of Ike's f and up smash
            It's the reverse. Ganon's is a better version of those smash attacks. It's still not enough to salvage him.
                I looked it up, turns out Ike's are slower, have more knockback, but do less damage
Seems like when tier disparity is as high as it is in Smult, you can feel the weaknesses of the bottom tiers at much lower levels of play than in more tightly balanced games. Ganon's shortcomings become an issue basically as soon as the people you're fighting learn how to edgeguard.
    I think it's the opposite, actually - Lower level play opens the game up to tactics which wouldn't work against optimal play, but is extremely effective otherwise. Ganon has a big psych-game which tends to intimidate opponents who know they can get killed by an errant Fsmash. High level players aren't fazed by this in the way low to mid level players are.
        I've never known a low level player to get psyched out by danger; those motherfuckers are unconditionable and have no regard for their own lives, and playing that kind of risk/reward meta is usually more stack than they can juggle. Like, I can see how there _could_ be a mindgame there, but by the time the players get to that point, they're already competent enough to just stuff his recovery and disrespect his stage presence. Even if you give him space and time to work, Ganon doesn't really have the tools to apply pressure that doesn't lose to mashing unless you're seriously outplaying your opponent.
 at least zelda can camp and have virtually non punishable recovery
    My point wasn't that Zelda is worse than Ganon by any means, just that similar to ganon her lack of mobility will always render her a pretty bad character at least
         true, but both of them are hella fun to play casual
            Trust me I feel you lol I've been a Zelda main since melee because of how much I love sweetspot fair/bair and ganon has always been one of my top secondaries because he's so much stupid fun
                landing a sweet spotted fair/bair or ledge trap them to death as zelda is soo much fun

too bad I am not good at landing sweet spot and camping so zelda isn't the best option for me

I still play zelda w my friends thou

  
As for gannon, a turn around warlock punch catching roll feels better than nuttin fr
I definitely think Zelda is the best she's ever been in Ultimate (i.e. not bottom 5) as while her mobility kinda sucks, her projectile game got upgraded substansially in Ultimate which allows her to get in more easily
    I don't think anyone could argue against Ult Zelda being the best version of the character ever. Previously it was a toss up between Melee and Smash 4 but in both of those games she was really really bad (and we don't talk about Brawl Zelda)

In Ult she is a viable character with (imo) a handful of winning matchups vs some high/top tiers. She just has a few too many matchups against prominent characters where she loses HARD so she's still low tier
        As a Zelda main myself, I definitely agree with this.
I mean, thatâ€™s not entirely true.

Just look at Steve and Snake. Those 2 characters have some of the worst mobility in the game, yet are still seen as the best characters in the game. It mostly boils down to how good their normals are and how polarizing their projectiles, camping, and neutral is.
people simply figured him out and the meta shifted to a far more defensive one
 u are a falco main o it must be sastifying to do uptilts on him
Love my character with the fakest confirms in the game :'(

Still fun to play though
    I learned how to play em cause I, like a fool, thought they would add a hollow knight deluxe skin for mii swordie ðŸ™ƒ
        I played them because one of my friends was casually playing them as a joke and they wanted me to try them out, I realized I really liked them and spent a while working on them and I actually took my first tournament set using them (it was at an invitational for various north carolina universities) which motivated me to keep going with them.

Heâ€™s awesome, but heâ€™s also the worst character in the game. Those arenâ€™t mutually exclusive.
    You smoking crack lmao
Top level players use him wrong?
    Correct. They donâ€™t use him because theyâ€™re scared of his frame data

Getting stopped by the smallest attack is how the game works. Ganon is just slow
Dude should have armor on all his B moves and smash attacks

Give Doriyah k rool level super armor but on his entire body
Tbh I think his is slightly better than docs just because he can actually recover high whereas doc usually canâ€™t.

Youâ€¦.obviously havenâ€™t fought a good Min Min. 

God bless your naive soul. Your life is far better than those of us that understand the true horrorâ€¦

Look up Doramigi on YouTube and youâ€™ll get the best idea of how this character is operated at a top level.
    being ledge trapped by a character on the other side of the stage with 2 smash attacks with 1 can even cover the stage above u 

yeahhhhhh, that b\*tch is A+ to S tier
        Forget A+ there's no way min min isn't top 10
             well, I normally list S tiers at top3 in my chart so, yeah, I think I can squeeze min min in top5 even, behind only steve, joker, rob, sonic (just my opinion thou, but kaz come after min min)

 don't cancel me pls :)
                Valid opinion on the ranking but I don't think a tier of just 3 would be good design because there's not that much of a gap
                     yeah, true, but I feel like steve, sonic, rob dominates the meta so much that they deserve on another tier list like ss (maybe adding joker and min min makes better design thou on second thought) 

other "S" tier characters like cloud, G&W, kazuya, terry is like rlly strong but I don't feel their dominance in my local region. IG I haven't ran into a really good one yet but my own experience greatly influences my tier list making
    As a Doc main, a bad Min Min devastates me.

Unless I'm far superior in every which way to them, I lose badly. Doc just has no tools against Min Min
Saying that Min Min is bad is CRAZY and even more considering that Ganon vs Min Min is probably one of the worst matchups in the whole game
ðŸ‘€
There's so much about the comment.
What kill confirms?
And have you ever played against  a min min or robin?
    This. This is the craziest take. I respect it.
    Basically his entire moveset is comprised of kill confirms. But for one, down throw into neutral air, dash attack into neutral air, honestly neutral air EVERYTIME. And yes, I've fought against plenty of min mins and Robin's, and I've never once lost to them like I have with Ganon. You could say its a skill issue, but there's something more going on.
        Those kill confirms arenâ€™t kill confirms. They donâ€™t work on high percents. And I see why you struggle with Ganondorf. You play Lucario, and Lucario is a featherweight, and has a mechanic that makes him stronger at higher percents so he hates dying early. And no, there isnâ€™t a character with a worse combination of traits, because they all have a redeeming factor.
            lucario i thought was mid 80s weight? which is light but not featherweight iirc. Im getting the impression that OP is quite young based on their comments this thread.
                I played Lucario a bit and he does very early
                Thatâ€™s extremely light
                    the range is 62 to 135. And i was wrong anyway, his weight is 92, which is like lower mid.

edit: in fact, that is steves weight
        Neutral air is hardly a kill move unless you're at ledge or off stage and at the percents it does kill it def won't be comboing with down throw and dash attack would prolly kill before that. Most characters have a lot of kill confirms but not many have GOOD kill confirms there's a difference between ganon down throw RAR bair and Roy/chrom jab RAR bair. Partially because of how risk free it is to throw out a jab compress to a grab but also because ganon is slow as shit. Even if he had Mythra down tilt into up smash he'd still be shit because he doesn't have any antizoning tools, he's got a huge hit box and once again is slow as shit. These are problems that min min or robing don't even have to consider
Bro has been fighting level 1 Min Min CPUs.
You're kidding about min min right? She's widely accepted as an amazing character. I agree she's not as good as a lot of people make her out to be but shes not even comparable to mid tiers, let alone contenders for overall worst character.
You had me until quote Robin. And Min Min, who obviously is high tier.
hes not as good at killing as he first appears. Alot of things he does fall apart offline against players that know how is setups work.
Yeah, Peanut has shown some respect on Little Mac.

His recovery isn't as bad as we first thought, since he has 3 resources: Side-B, Down Air stall, Up-B ~~still bad but like, look at Doc and Ganondorf~~

His combo and damage is actually kind of insane, with some nasty true combos, kill set ups, edgeguarding and incredible frame data, plus armor. Then there's ladder combos, platform tech chases that straight up lead to KO...
Not a true combo
    Don't gotta be
        It does at mid-high level play. Teching flame choke isn't hard even online, and then your combo isn't a combo anymore
            If I ever see those players I will let you know, too busy goonin ðŸ˜Ž
He's perfect ðŸ‘Œ
Idk what the op is on ganons smashes feel like sneezes compared to pyras, thereâ€™s other characters with better ones too I think
    Oh yeah, Ganondorf doesn't have any top 5 strongest smash attacks. F smash and up smash are actually just both weaker versions of Ike's f and up smash
        It's the reverse. Ganon's is a better version of those smash attacks. It's still not enough to salvage him.
            I looked it up, turns out Ike's are slower, have more knockback, but do less damage
I think it's the opposite, actually - Lower level play opens the game up to tactics which wouldn't work against optimal play, but is extremely effective otherwise. Ganon has a big psych-game which tends to intimidate opponents who know they can get killed by an errant Fsmash. High level players aren't fazed by this in the way low to mid level players are.
    I've never known a low level player to get psyched out by danger; those motherfuckers are unconditionable and have no regard for their own lives, and playing that kind of risk/reward meta is usually more stack than they can juggle. Like, I can see how there _could_ be a mindgame there, but by the time the players get to that point, they're already competent enough to just stuff his recovery and disrespect his stage presence. Even if you give him space and time to work, Ganon doesn't really have the tools to apply pressure that doesn't lose to mashing unless you're seriously outplaying your opponent.
My point wasn't that Zelda is worse than Ganon by any means, just that similar to ganon her lack of mobility will always render her a pretty bad character at least
     true, but both of them are hella fun to play casual
        Trust me I feel you lol I've been a Zelda main since melee because of how much I love sweetspot fair/bair and ganon has always been one of my top secondaries because he's so much stupid fun
            landing a sweet spotted fair/bair or ledge trap them to death as zelda is soo much fun

too bad I am not good at landing sweet spot and camping so zelda isn't the best option for me

I still play zelda w my friends thou

  
As for gannon, a turn around warlock punch catching roll feels better than nuttin fr
I don't think anyone could argue against Ult Zelda being the best version of the character ever. Previously it was a toss up between Melee and Smash 4 but in both of those games she was really really bad (and we don't talk about Brawl Zelda)

In Ult she is a viable character with (imo) a handful of winning matchups vs some high/top tiers. She just has a few too many matchups against prominent characters where she loses HARD so she's still low tier
    As a Zelda main myself, I definitely agree with this.
I learned how to play em cause I, like a fool, thought they would add a hollow knight deluxe skin for mii swordie ðŸ™ƒ
    I played them because one of my friends was casually playing them as a joke and they wanted me to try them out, I realized I really liked them and spent a while working on them and I actually took my first tournament set using them (it was at an invitational for various north carolina universities) which motivated me to keep going with them. Then I played dmc and immediately got the Dante skin for them.

A year and a half later, I feel like I've figured out almost everything they have to offer (much of which I've figured out by myself by playing against better people) and I've realized I should finally stop seriously playing them to either solo main Incineroar or work on young link (whose kit translates shockingly well with what I've learned from swordfighter). Whatever happens, it was a fun trip, and I plan on updating [the video I made for them](https://youtu.be/HCiLaqOTT20?si=rrRCC6BRBFrxrr9F) as a sort of last hurrah.
You smoking crack lmao
Correct. They donâ€™t use him because theyâ€™re scared of his frame data
    Honestly I have no clue how ganon would in any world match characters like Steve, Sonic and Rob.
Tier lists discuss who is played the most too
    Thereâ€™s also tier lists out there for which characters have the best feet in the game but that doesnâ€™t make it relevant to OPâ€™s question.
Also for how long it takes I'd add uptiltÂ 
Doc can recover high. He can use pills to get a reversal and cover the stage. Doc can recover about the same distance as Ganondorf, except heâ€™s faster and has more mixups.
What u mean "all about endlag"? All of his aerials are very safe on shield
I meant more top 8 at majors
    It used to be this way, tiers definitely still matter a ton by at least top 32, thereâ€™s just way too many good players nowadays
i would say even at mid level he already drops to pretty fucking bad.
    Maybe. But someone like nairos Ganon would stomp almost any other player who isnt a top player. I do think mid level Ganon takes more skill to win with tho.
being ledge trapped by a character on the other side of the stage with 2 smash attacks with 1 can even cover the stage above u
