[[[Unpopular Opinion] Just say you don‚Äôt play smokes, don‚Äôt fill then do this self-pitying thing.]]


Usually when I choose my agent I‚Äôll select whatever agent I want to play (gekko recently) but I won‚Äôt lock in in case I need to fill smokes. I used to play a lot of smokes, so I‚Äôm pretty well aware of how to smoke, at least when it comes to basic smokes.

I keep getting teammates that have never properly learned smokes but I guess keep filling cuz they load in slow or something, where they‚Äôll do smokes that look straight out of gold, get mad at people asking them to do certain better smokes, whine about instalockers, then keep doing the same dogshit smokes (maybe muting everyone in the process).

No one is forcing them to play smokes; I avoid locking in specifically for this reason. Yet it seems like they want to play smokes just to victimize themselves and spite the instalock duelists or something.

I‚Äôm pretty sure these people are all Reyna mains that get angry other ppl chose their Reyna but won‚Äôt admit it.


I play in lower ranks and having a filled smoke feels like playing against double or tripple controller.
    Totally agree. I main brimstone and it‚Äôs at the point now where seeing a friendly clove is usually a negative smokes for our team.
the fact that even in HIGH IMMORTAL people would go " i dont know how to play smokes üò≠üò≠" like wtf you never saw anyone in your team smoking so you can just copy?
    Or never been smoked off by the enemy... I can understand not getting value out of the rest of the agent's kit but playtime should be enough to tell a good smoke from a bad one.
When yo own teammates smoke entry on attack like bruh is common sense not to
    we do a little info denial
    Not necessarily terrible, doing a deep smoke on the choke can give you more angles to peak out of or allow you take a bit of extra map control
        Bruh what
            He has a point. Attacker A site ascent. As a cypher I like caging the entrance and then another cage to the right where the bricks are. It means the defenders now have a much bigger surface area to cover and it helps you not get insta shot by an OP. Skye flash/kayo flash/soca dart/jett dash works well with this. 

Works well with a 4-5 man flash explode out of the smoke if you conditioned them well enough early game.
                Yes, this thing is much more frequent with cypher cages than normal smokes but my point stands
            There are times you could smoke your own choke, but it's super situational and needs good communication about the intent and how to play off of it.
Someone filling smokes shouldn't do it.

Here's a video (iirc) where Lothar gives an example:

            Taking ascent as an example, these are both situational smokes for when you only have 1 smoke left or are trying to play a lurk.

B site one lets you run/lurk onto lane and the A site one gives more angles to peek fight site, though its also a common defender smoke for holding against a split.

You see this kind of thing done a lot more commonly with cypher cages on offense than actual smokes, but the point stands

                No i get all that i read ur comment too fast and by deep i thought u meant smoke deep into their side
I don't think it's that unpopular, I feel like most people agree on playing an agent you enjoy instead of filling and be clueless as you have no clue how the agent work.
    Get flamed for picking Reyna cuz I enjoy her

Get flamed for playing/smoking like crap on omen
At the end of the day, if you are any rank above plat, you have no excuse for not knowing how "to play" smokes. You have played this game enough to know if you push A site on Ascent, you smoke door and heaven. People who say they don't play smokes and straight up refuse to play smoke are probably just bad team players anyway.
This 100%. as a Controller main, if I was playing a different role I would 100% rather to just not have smokes than have somebody "fill" and not know wtf they are doing. \*\*\*UNLESS\*\*\* they let me know ahead of time they don't really know how to play controller but are willing to take suggestions. I'm fine pinging where to smoke, not a problem at all.
Ill say this, if someone were to instalock in my games and they decided to tell me what agent/roles to pick, I would pick it while fucking around. Not my fault they told me what to do, im just following orders XD.
Jokes on you I main smokes so this is never an issue
God I hate that shit on any role. 

BOOHOO WE HAD NO____

Like dude literally no one was asking you to fill
no smokes is better than bad smoke.
On the other side your teammate feels as if he‚Äôs forced into smokes, then when in game he then gets flamed by the instalockers for him playing poorly on a role he doesn‚Äôt usually play
    Monkey see, monkey do is too complicated for Valorant players.
    Don't play smokes then, just play something you know how to play.
I *LOATHE* when people don‚Äôt know how to use smokes. It‚Äôs like you‚Äôre doing more harm than good.
Having no smokes is better than having bad smokes. Bad smokes makes it more difficult for your team, and often help the enemy team.

Play who you want and don‚Äôt play agents you are not comfortable on.
meanwhile ive filled so many times in iron that i have most hours on omen (im playing alot of raze recently tho)
Have had people lock clove at the start, and then say ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you play smokes then?‚Äù If I ask them to smoke anywhere
    yeah this was kinda the last straw after it actually happened to me, im gonna be playing clove more over omen to try and help the team while getting high frags
        Thank you for your service. So tired of Clove tryhards being an actual nuisance to the team by not doing their role.
I used to main omen and harbor and I‚Äôve got okay aim at times, so I love Clove now. But at low ranks, I‚Äôm afraid of smokes after death sometimes because I‚Äôve had people yell at me for good smokes, bad ones, not doing it, doing it when I shouldn‚Äôt, etc. basically any smoke after death that leads to a teammate dying is often grounds for someone raging hah it‚Äôs stressful
Smokes are so easy to do, right? I wonder why players who care about winning don't put in the 10 minute effort to learn how to play smokes and save their 45 minutes of playing a losing game
Totally agree. I main brimstone and it‚Äôs at the point now where seeing a friendly clove is usually a negative smokes for our team.
