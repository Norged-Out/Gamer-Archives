[[Thoughts on Clove at end of act]]


Now that it's the end of the act and people have had time to adjust to Clove, their play style and how they blend into the current meta, what do you think of them?

Personally, I LOVE them. They compliment my personal play style completely, and I think their entire kit meshes great together. They're now my new main and I instalock them on every map except Breeze and Icebox, which I usually play Viper on.

Only problem with Clove is now I can't use being a controller an excuse as to why I'm bottom fragging, but it's whatever 



it's a great agent when you're with your team. you can call out and give smokes even after you die. and the decay tool is very great if used in a combo with sova or raze.

overall? 8/10
    Raze nade + decay = sudden death. My silver ass got aced from rushing A main on Lotus with that combo
        and that's EXACTLY why you don't push out until you are SURE that raze doesn't nade on lotus. helps to tell your teammates too
            I always warn my teammates and they still rush out and get naded 😐
                i guess it's not your fault then lmao, not sure what you could do tho
                    Use Astra and suck your teammates back before they go out to die
                        unfortunately they can run out too fast, to where you'd be either missing them or pulling them into the nade. a sage wall appears to be the most logical solution that i can think of
                Neon players mad because teammate who can't get to the other side fast enough block us when we run past it (we can make it 10/10 times we just don't because Skye's and Phoenix's jump in front of us and kill our momentum)
            unless you're chamber
                fair
        Happened to me too but with an added fault line for extra brutality
    My friend mains brim, we pair the decay with the Molly. *chefs kiss*
love the agent hate the palyers lmao
    Isn't this every agent?
        Hate breach love the players
        Hate breach love the players
        Hate breach love the players
        Hate breach love the players
        Hate breach love the players
    Clove players always smoke for the enemies, like smoking off main when attacking. I'm silver so maybe it's not the case in higher ranks.
        nah definitely still is the case lol, at least in Plat 3, my clove making one ways for the enemy, and their clove straight up smoking their own entries
The problem with clove has mainly been people who want to use them but have never used a smoker before and end up  ruining the matche (gold lobbies)
    Eventually they'll either learn or quit.

I hope.
>Be me  
>Main Smokes  
> Stop maining smokes bc i want to try something diffrent  
> Clove gets released, clove instalock every game  
> they smoke like shit  
> back to instalocking smokes
    There's a slight chance that more people will know the basics of smoking after clove got mega popular, at least :D give it a few months and maybe even the fill omen on your team isn't shit
        Love this optimism, one can only hope this is the case 😅
    I'm trying to play viper on some maps it's nice having an instalock smoker until they don't use their E at all
    Bro how hard is it to smoke without leaving a gap, and they still do it wrong like wtf
What's with all the gender neutral terms? Is clove non binary?
    yes the description uses them pronoun
        Ah that makes sense then, thanks
    Yeah, the original post used she/her pronouns until someone pointed it out so I changed it, forgot they're nb
        Cool, thanks for clarification
    Yea
    Yeah, Cloves enby!
    I play with my game in French sometimes (I’m mostly bilingual) and it’s the first time I’ve seen the French word “lel” which is the nonbinary pronoun (equivalent of they/them) - I had to look it up at first but I found it interesting! We actually have it easy in English because they/them already serves this purpose
    [removed]
        I'm not judging, I genuinely wanted to know
            yea, no binary btw
Gameplay apart i love their lines, way of speaking and dnd references ahah, each game i discover new interactions between them and other agents
    Roll for initiative always gets me
        Ahhah shit, I lost my pet roooock
            Fade's mind games are not match for my secret weapon, ibuprofen
    « Would you look at that? They lost AGAIN! »
    NAT 20! Love that.
    The way they say “Critical Hit!” really tickles a part of my brain
    Yall arent even getting the best one. “Find the weakest link and kickem’intheshin”
    Ikr ? I really love their vibe
    Hi ✨😇 Bye 🔥👹
    only one that i really don’t like is “i know what we should do… we should win”
almost never play anyone else again after i got clove  
unless my friends want to play clove  
then i can go play phoenix or some random agent sometimes

but most of time i just pick clove and it work on anything
She's okay. I love running away from her ult and letting her die whenever possible. It's annoying when teammates unnecessarily fight it
    Nah sometimes you got to fight it, that timer for her to get a kill last way longer than you expect. But yeah you get the kill from afar just run
        Lmao bro is just trynna get a reaction 😂🫵🏼
            You high or something?
            I don't think bro is but if bro is you just gave bro one
                Bro got the broaction
    What do you mean? It dies after a few seconds or something ?
        Clove needs a kill or damaging assist shortly after reviving or they just die again.
            If I had a dollar for every time I’ve lost a game in ranked because clove ults and someone tries to fight her, I could buy the battle pass.
    Clove's nb and therefore THEY're ok
    She? Oh nah theyre gonna ban u 😭
decent agent for attacking half but the players who play her are mostly aggressive duelists who have no damn idea about smokes, at least in my server
    Yep, ive been instalocking bc im sick of getting smokes that help the enemy more than the team 😭
They're fine, could maybe use some small buffs, but there are a lot of agents that need some work done before Clove, so the fact fairly balanced and playable on launch is fine especially considering the last few releases have been pretty awful.
    They still have the chamber launch ptsd, and every new agent since then has been launched underpowered
        Yeah, honestly Clove feels like the most balanced agent upon release for a while.
    Just based on soloqueue stats, probably needs some sort of nerf.

My guess would be on the ult. Too much value.

Hard character to balance though, Kit on paper doesn't seem too strong.
        Ult is fine just run and u good
        >Just based on soloqueue stats, probably needs some sort of nerf.

What stats u referring to
            Clove has the highest win rate out of any agent in almost every rank, even higher than pre nerf chamber
        Maybe just give her 8 ult points instead of 7. They did that to a lot of agents so I wouldn’t be surprised if they do it with her.
            the nerf is probably going to her c and q, not her ult. Her ult isn't providing as much value as people think, hitting it would be like hitting Raze on her ult.

Pick me up probably will be getting price hit or duration hit, could be a bit of both

Meddle will also probably get hit in the Decay duration.
                Tbf theyve hit raze on their ult directly a ton, and changed some maps (bind) specifically to also make her ult worse.
                    I think I'm bad at metaphot but. Raze nerf hit hard on her E, C, Q. No one really give too much heck on her ult point getting up to 8 bc her kit was the real meat.
        I think they're just popular on soloqueue because they're a really versatile agent with smokes as well. Really good for soloqueue tbh but I don't think they're overpowered
        smokes shouldn't recharge on death, or only allow one smoke while dead. only nerf they really need
        I would also have said a few small nerfs instead of buffs. But maybe Riot will wait and see how they are played in Pro Play before they make any changes.
        Probably the only Nerf I can see is add some additional conditions to the ult somehow. Cus honestly ult is the highest value utility by far. Cost increase could be viable too
    are we playing the same game? Clove needs NERFS, not buffs. It's literally the agent with the highest win % in the game and it's not even close.
Probably one of the best character releases in a while. They’re very strong while not being obscenely OP. Riot did good
She's ok, pleasantly surprised riot actually nailed it in one go on a new release. Bugs aside ofc.
    I wanna see her used in pro play, probably won't see that for a while tho :(
        i doubt they’ll see lots of play… they’re a very self sufficient agent *when* they get kills, akin reyna and iso who both aren’t played either
            If they pick Clove it will be because they can smoke while dead.
            I would disagree as even with kills, clove isn't very self sufficient, as she doesn't have the un-tradeability of reyna with dismiss, and also her heal goes away very quickly and doesn't even leave you with full normal health like reynas does. Just a take
        I don't think Clove will get many (if any) appearances in pro play at all, they're just not better than Viper and/or Omen who dominate the meta for quite a while now.
            Yeah omen can be more aggressive with the blind and tp. Clove can do that with self rez and boost, but omen smokes are better. As for viper, her ultimate is really good to take control of site and not to mention her molly that is useful post plant
            omen is 100% better in pro play because of freedom of smoke and range  
omen can better one way on a lot of stuff that clove can't

tp can be a pressure by just having it or make play, can bait enemy and create space for team too  
blind is superior and have better aoe than clove decay  
both c and ulti can have high pressure in map

but i'd just play clove because it's easier to smoke  
can one way on a lot of stuff by just point click than having to aim mode  
fast and accurate, c is easy to use  
x can always have value  
i don't care much about q but it's really useful and sometimes not need  
so i can spend on gun instead of that if sometimes i don't have enough money

smoke after dead is good for me too  
i can enter with friend and don't care if i would die or not and team will still have smoke around that area
            take the "(if any)" out of your message. she will. (she might not be great, but she will)
        Maybe next time? I don’t think the most teams will swap their controller agents with clove. But I do think we will see some teams try it
        TenZ said he’ll use Clove in pro play once they’re allowed and their bugs are fixed.
Seems really balanced and a reasonable agent to play as, with, or against. Beautiful contract skin and very nice sprays. Unique mechanics that are still intuitive to play around.
   
Downsides are that many people don't respect their pronouns and most Cloves I've seen so far are fucking incompetent at smoking
    Another plus is that they’re much more fun to play than other controllers for the players who like to be aggressive, downside is no pee break
    Tge fact that ppl not give a fuck about a video game characters pronouns is even a concern to you is fucking hilarious. Wait till you have real problems to deal with in life
        For NB people like me, people like you who invalidate our identities and don't care to use our preferred pronouns are actually a real problem we deal with!
            I didn't invalidate ur identity. Stop making things about yourself.
        most empathetic mature valorant player right here folks
            Waaaaaaaaa waaaaaaaaa my casual game has to be my way only and everyone else is dumb
            Me not showing empathy to a not real person? War crime honestly
                you're invaldating represention  and validation for a minorty group coming from a place of ignorance or malice, I would say that's unempathetic
                    Don't attribute malice to indifference to video game character identity. If it looks like a girl, ppl will call her a girl. Cuz it's not targeted at an actual person, if u chose to get offended on the fake person's behalf than that's a personal problem u need to speak to a therapist with. Goodluck.
    its a game who cares about the pronouns in casual game sessions?
    DON'T RESPECT THE PRONOUNS LMAOOO. who cares? 
I hate those leftists so much. IT IS JUST A CHARACTER. 
"-they are on A plant
Team rotates to A and see a Clove"
        What?

"He's on A". 

Who? That's not any more useful. If you can determine the agent's gender, tell your team which agent? If you can't determine who it is, call out the numbers? "One A long" would be the call-out in this situation. 

"He's on A, plant" isn't a real call-out; there's no world, unless you're avoiding the site Aspas is on, where you call for a plant when you see only one player. 

The only context you really use a character's pronouns is when giving additional information, and they/they pronouns don't actually impact that. "Sova lit; they're top site".
        Clove is on A

Problem solved. Not that hard.
            It was just a joke.
                Schrodinger’s douchebag
                There's no pun or humour... Okay though.
        That's the teams fault for a poor call-out, you should always use the name of the character(s). Or if it's sound, say the amount. You are angry at a video game character's pronouns due to a skill issue? Life must suck for you then.
        Wow, yep, you really got them, great job 'owning the libs', you're so smart, I wish I could be so witty
        Dawg it’s just a fictional character, why are you so worked up on pronouns
            No one can answer this question lol, mixing feelings and emotions and weird shit into a game makes me wonder how smart some people are
            Exactly - it's just a fictional character. What the point of "respecting the pronouns"
                It’s just respecting the meaning behind it. If you don’t care about it then don’t say anything. Unless it’s clearly damaging something
                Well it would be a bit weird if someone insisted on refering to Reyna as a guy or Brim as a girl wouldn’t it? You respect the gender of other characters, so why not Clove too
                    Maybe bcs this creature looks like a girl?
                    Because it’s easily determined. If a child who had no knowledge of the life’s good barbecue people was shown every valorant agent and was asked if it was a boy or girl it would say Jett, Reyna, Clove, Etc. are all girls and Brimstone, Phoenix, and Chamber, Etc. are all boys.
                        Maybe the point of NB representation is so all those children have one more opportunity to discover we exist? Should we also make all the characters white because some child maybe never seen a person that isn't white? 

What's the correlation you're trying to draw between "MAYBE a child hasn't seen X" so "not include X in valorant"? Children haven't seen soul sucking latinas, hopefully, so maybe we delete reyna? Children haven't ever seen floating islands IRL so delete ascent!
                            That’s not what I said nor what I intend by what I said and don’t make this racist and what the fuck do you mean by delete ascent because children have never seen floating islands irl. I am fine with NB rep as I don’t care I am simply making a statement about how a child is going to not notice or probably care that a non binary character exists.
                            And just to add my own perspective into this, why do you “need representation” im not saying you “don’t have rights” or you need to be executed for being different but why do you need representation through a video game and why force that ideology onto people that either are against it or don’t care
                                Non-binary people need representation so people can see that they are just regular human beings like anyone else, especially since transgender people are being used as political scapegoats right now.
                                    First off, 90% of people see nb  and trans people as regular people or just don’t care or say anything. I personally don’t care just don’t shove it in my face and force me to like you. Second off, where in the hell are trans people being used as political scapegoats?
                            Also there’s no “correlation” im trying to draw between “child never seen x so don’t include it”
I love Clove, I don't play this character but I'm finally free to play sentinels and initiators instead of filling Omen every match 🙏
For me it was like my favorite parts of reyna, brimstone, and phoenix merged into one and I love playing them. Their bomb is okay, don’t care much about that but I love their smokes, self-heal, and self revive.
I love their molly. I didnt realise the potential until recently. Imagine on pistol as the enemies are entrying, you throw the molly at a chokepoint and can now 1 tap all the enemies. Its crazy how big the range is. 

Aggressive plays like running down B main ascent on defence with a judge or something become so possible due to the decay, or even combos like decay+ shock dart. its so great to clear corners with also.
Started the act trying to play them on every map except Breeze, now I’m down to split, lotus, and sunset as decent Clove maps. Where I can play Clove, they are really strong and I like the aggressive playstyle that it allows me to build. 

I want to be able to use Clove on more maps but the smoke range is very limiting. Killing lurk potential or playing on the extremities which is also good for aggressive play. If I can pair with a Cypher or someone actually good at stalling then that concern is lessened. But in the cases where that isn’t the case then I’m probably back on Omen.
Riot DEFINITELY made up for the last horrible controller releases  (and worst agent in the entire game )  … 
Harbor .
    a good harbor is scary .. on the other hand 75% i’ve played are seriously smooth brained
        Trust me … I 1 trick  viper for almost 2 years now and was initially excited when harbor was first released until I saw how underpowered (and the worst part is how team reliant he is . )
As harbor you can have the best set ups on attack and defense wall/ smoke everything off but if your team doesn’t follow up you’re screwed . 
Harbor is the only agent in game where his smokes create a negative status effect on team mates (the slow effect ) 
I went from diamond 1 to bronze trying to play harbor only  in ranked. 
There’s only 1 serious harbor player in radiant that streams on YouTube and he stopped playing him because there’s so many other better agents .
There’s a reason why he’s sitting literally at the bottom of the character select pick rate of all agents
            honestly not a bad arguement, and yeah i see him played maybe once or twice a day. nothing more.
        Also his ult is shit and last so little of time , also is team reliant and it’s hard to guarantee  a kill off of it
They're great for solo que, maybe even the best in the game, but I doubt they will see much play in pro or 5 stacks
The playstyle suits me so for me Clove is the best agent in the game rn but objectively I'd say it's around 7/10. 

A lot of people play clove wrong either thinking they're a duelist and completely forgetting to do the controller part or just throwing bad smokes with bad timing. 

Shorter smokes duration means you have to be more intentional with them and aware of timings. If you smoke too early the smokes are gone by the time your team finally does anything. 

Q is good, not the best ability ever but pretty usable. 

C is really situational. 3 things need to happen in order for it to be useful - 1) You got a kill or an assist 2) you're not full HP 3) you're about to take another fight. And also even if this all happens you can get one tapped and it was for nothing. It can also make you feel like you have to look for another fight if you used it so you end up overheating. When it works it's pretty great tho and it only costs 100 credits so it's not a big deal if you end up wasting it. 

Ult is just as situational if not more. Yeah, it can win you the round if used correctly but you end up dying again a lot. Either because everyone runs away from you or they manage to get to you before you can pull out your gun and shoot them back. You need a brain to use this ability well. 

Overall I think clove is perfectly well balanced, doesn't feel weak to play but also not annoying to play against, at least not for me.
    just 1.5s shorter than omen smoke, not much different imo

sometimes i want smoke disappear faster too like viper who can manually wall up down  
too long smoke also make i harder to push into my own smoke and do something  
like when i one way early just to take space or burn enemy util  
and let my team take space on other part of map  
sometimes i want to push asap after i spotted them somewhere else
        Also her smokes pop faster and are easier to do. (Plus can do 2 at once, unlike Omen)
Perfection in all aspects. Looks, gameplay, personality. They are amazing.
I'm honestly considering switching from Kj to Clove since I feel I play very good with them, even when I fail with my ult(lol).
Allows too many people (that are bad at smokes) to play smokes. The game has fundamentally  changed with the introduction of another cool smoker. There are probably on average > 3 smokers per game in my plat to asc lobbies. 

It reminds me of that meme of the VCT game where some team is executing on Bind’s B site and there is just like 15 abilities happening all at once.
Last I checked they apparently have the highest win rate across all ranks. So yeah, pretty good I’d say.
They are good. But uh judging from the comments, this might be an unpopular opinion, but I think their Q ability is shit.
I think they are really good with the right comp. I really do not like the double duelist comps most ranked players have engrained in their mind when they see a clove. Clove plays like a duelist. Smoke, throw q at common site hold spots, run in and die (with res preferably). Smoke while dead after site take. Having 2 initiators goes crazy with clove. Especially on a map like bind where you can run skye and gekko
I main them. I used to be a duelist main but started taking the role of smokes because of too much pressure as a duelist. Missed playing duelist and clove is a perfect agent for me
Good agent. Good design. Ult timer feels like a long ass while but that’s probably just a me problem
    You can terminate it prematurely by hitting x
        I’m talking the kill timer
            That seems really short, doesn’t it? It’s only like two seconds you can decide. If anything I would like them to extend it a bit so that way you can almost bait the enemy team and stall triggering it
IMO a really fun and strong pick for ranked, especially solo queue. Not sure how well they’ll do in pro play, but overall I’m having a really fun time with them
    They'll probably be shit in proplay unless ppx does some weird shit, but I'm very glad they released an agent for actual players. I'd like to think we deserve at least some agents that aren't tailored for competitive
I think she's pretty good when you have a functional team. Plus her outift is so cutee
    their outfit is so cute!!
its the end of the act and i still see reyna mains picking them when someone instalocks reyna earlier
Omens and brim fell hard, Clove was supposed to be competition to Omen as aggressive controller, but it's more Clove than him.
She’s a hybrid character, which might be both a blessing and a curse. You can get more kills, but at the same time you don’t focus on being a controller and keep getting dragged into unneccessary fights.

She’s really good if you are solo queuing with good aim. Now you can smoke yourself and take fights more liberatingly
Fun to play. Not overly annoying. Her ult was annoying to begin but easy to deal with now (chase or hide from her)
It’s even good on breeze in my opinion, ofc as a secondary smoke allowing to to smoke off for A/B split, forever hall smoke creating immense pressure, ofc this can be done by omen too but it’s not as bad as it seems
They’re strong and easy to play. Nice mix up for controller player who plays omen and brim
She's mid
I love clove sm, amazing agent
Great agent. 


Don't love that so many people play her and don't know s thing about smokes.
Meta, unfortunately everyone instalocking her has no idea how to smoke.
Tbh people haven't liked my takes on Clove. I dont think they are cracked like everyone says. I can only give perspective from playing in plat/dia + a bunch of swifts with friends in iron to silver.

CONS:
1) Smokes last the least amount if time of all the controllers, making the exec harder if we get stalled even slightly
2) Meddle cant do line ups due to automatic explosion
3) Meddle can be dodged easily so long as you get out of line of sight from the center of it.
4) Overheal isnt useful unless you took damage (isnt helpful to the team overall
5) Smoke range is limited forcing her to play near mid or be locked to one of the two sites
6) Situational post death smokes, and can actually mess up your teammates if done incorrectly
7) Ultimate is situationally good, teammates can steal the kill before u get damage on and get you killed. Enemy team can run away and force you to die.
8) Smokes are clear inside + cant float in the air like an omen smoke
9) Further proof that people dont know how to play smokes properly because my god ive seen terrible clove smokes almost every game. They give you the ipad idk how these smokes are in bad spots / not flush with entryways.

PROS:
1) New potential agent poggies
2) Non-binary representation poggies
3) Gives us a faster paced, run it down kind of controller, having the heal helps to continue the push
4) Post death smokes can clutch up rounds / dying isnt as bad
5) potential for util combos with meddle
6) High clutch potential especially in post-plant using Ult
7) Baby Easy ipad smokes (yet somehow people are still bad at this)
8) Rechargeable smokes

Overall, I still think the cons out weigh the pros, but I dont think Clove is bad more so other Agents do their job better than them. Omen / Viper > Brim > Clove > Astra > Harbor
    If your after death smokes are selling your teammates you shouldn’t be playing smokes anyways bc ur selling while alive.

Overheals great for rotate/pushing further on site

Almost every ult is situationally good, and forcing enemies to run away for 15 seconds is amazing value.

Honestly iPad smokes are so much harder for me than omen, because half the time when you smoke you’re moving and I can see gaps when I place omen smokes and fine tune it instantly where I can’t for clove(have to exit and re enter smokes)

Smoke range is fine unless on breeze, icebox, or lotus. Rest of games either it’s not a big deal or u should have cypher who can stall on defence for smokes to get there.

Ngl im not seeing the brim over clove, and viper has been the number 1 smokes since she first came to meta I think.
Great agent, people who know nothing about controllers are picking her up and doing a piss poor job at controlling
I am a clove main now. I actually hit diamond for the first time basically only using clove. I love their kit. The smokes after death is so good. I love the fact you can take risks with them. I do think that some of the kit is a tad weak. I mean if you compare meddle to shock dart for example. One deals damage that likely will last the entire round and the other only decays for a few seconds. Also shock darts can go basically across the entire map whereas meddle has a set radius. I wouldn't really want this changed though as I think clove is basically an all round great agent with counter play. Basically, that part of their kit being weaker is so that the smokes after death are balanced which is all good imo. 

I am also Scottish and get a kick out of the voice lines.
good as a secondary controller with viper... kindof useless otherwise

overall the addition of Clove to the Valorant roster has been pretty positive and i’m glad we’ve got a hybrid agent as well as some Trans representation :)
Kinda boring gameplay compared to other agents imo
their ult is good buy many people use it at the wrong time and get killed immediately
I’m getting fed up with self healing and resurrecting agents. This game is a 5 v 5 tactical shooter and yet you might have to kill 8enemies in a round and I didn’t count any that you almost killed yet running around with max health.
I went from being a Reyna/Gekko/Yoru main to discovering that controllers are OP. I almost only play Clove now. She is a perfect combination of Reyna (overheal), Brim (stim and smokes) and Phoenix (ult)
My new main. I was a aggro viper main for two years and Clove fits my play style almost perfectly. Their kit rewards both playing for your team and playing on the front lines to get kills. My only problem is duelist mains locking Clove and they don’t know how to play smokes so we basically don’t have defensive smokes >:(
From the perspective of an omen player:

1. Lack of as many one ways as omen makes her smokes significantly weaker, but at least she can place them while dead.

2. Her heal is nice, but the timer goes very quickly so its most useful when pushing sites as the speed boost plus heal should last you most of the site hit.

3. Ult is insanely good. You can basically always pop it immediately when you get the chance and this lets you cycle it much more freely. Theres no "waste" unless its clearly just completely winning/losing regardless of your ult.
Sunset with clove is broken. On b, plant on the stairs against the wall and play main. Smoke yourself off and spam on ping. If clove dies, the strat still works. On A, plant in the corner of the green box and play elbow. Smoke yourself off and spam on ping. There is no counterplay.
NO PEEKING
The 2 seconds on the ult is way too short.  Should be 3 -3.5
Clove has exposed just how little people know about playing smokes, during this month they’ve been out I have witnessed smokes placed so poorly that they should constitute war crimes
Quite balanced in my opinion, a new addition to the game that is fun to play while also being a interesting character in my imo.
Amazing agent, amazing skills, just keep her away from me because I suck.
not a good character, so little utility. really miss having an omen especially on split and lotus.
I think she's fun to play as. His c ability is a little **absolutely terrible** (because it lasts like 7 seconds) but if the enemy team is rushing, you can make use of that ability. The smokes are also good and I love how you can use them after death, and her q is pretty good when you know where the enemy is.

However what I love the most is his ultimate but people really gotta know when to use it. I mean theres like a 4 second window to use it just think whetner or not thats a good idea first man.
clove to me is like a combo of reyna and brimstone with the smokes and overhealing from kills
Best agent since Astra. I’ve moved over to her as my main because im an aggressive player and it’s rewarded with clove.
I am absolutely in love. I typically played omen before their release but have slowly started switching to clove on some maps. So far I’ve had the most luck on them on sunset and lotus (I just have to be willing to play B every round on defense). I think they may work well for me on icebox as well. Split and ascent I’m undecided on. Bind is a little iffy because it can be difficult to provide smokes to the other site. Breeze I’d only play them if my team already has a wall controller, otherwise I’m sticking to omen as a solo controller or harbor as a second controller.

Overall their kit seems pretty balanced. I think the main issues I’ve had when playing are being annoyed at how small the smoke range is (coming from playing omen), forgetting I can smoke after death, and learning how to use the ult effectively. All are things I will adjust to with time. The smokes are easy to use, the decay can provide great value to the team, the pick me up is great for taking another fight or for quickly getting away, and the ult is powerful when used correctly. The entire kit is good and it makes me feel a lot more confident when playing. I see what everyone is saying about clove players not knowing how to smoke, but I never trusted randoms to play smokes before their release, so this isn’t a new experience.

I love their aesthetic and voicelines as well. The character and abilities look cool. The voicelines are funny. Everything about them makes them a fun agent to play. I am a little biased as a non-binary person who was thrilled to hear about their release. Being able to play a non-binary character is exciting. I also am in silver so my opinions are very much based on my experiences in that elo. Despite that, I think clove is an amazing character and they are slowly becoming my new main.
She has awesome util and is great at taking duels after you’ve entered site. Overall she’s a good addition esp for controller players who want a different play style imo
Hate clove with a passion. Most of my teammates throw garbage death smokes that end up assisting the enemies and all the enemy cloves are cracked 80% of the time.
I find myself playing clove more than omen
Love Clove as a character, but the people playing them always either have terrible smokes but great aim or great smokes and terrible aim
Reyna 3.0
I tried to play her but im not a fan she's too inconsistent imo.
Dunno, mayb cuz am noob but for me harbor bettah
As in playstyle, not meta
Well, at least Clove isn't hell of selfish like chamber and Iso. I will say this to everyone Clove player out there. KNOW when to use your ult. I see so many Clove players ult when they have no cover, they be ulting in 2v5's. Be smart with the ultimate because it isn't that hard
Shes obv overtuned her wr is crazy
    Turned into a new low elo stable along with reyna
Using “them” to address her is crazy, she’s clearly a female. Why not just say “she”?
 Controller isn’t really an excuse to bot frag anyway
When it comes to overall design I don't think any agent comes close to Clove (besides neon imo which might be a hot take). Best character design + theme and their kit isn't too op. However, I would always rather have an omen on my team. I think Clove is a great agent for people who aren't used to playing smokes because of the simplicity of their util + smokes after death but Omen is far better than them. I view it the same as when someone locks in Jett on Sunset still instead of Raze. Like it's fine and we can work around it and as long as they entry and do their job it's whatever but I'd still always have a Raze over Jett because her kit is just better for the map. One thing I love about them for ranked though is since everyone finds them so fun and locks them in I can play viper on maps like split, bind and lotus and have two smokes
Great agent, prolly my new main. The thing I liked the most about them is how strong, yet balanced riot made them. For instance, if u die the round u have 6 ult points, u won’t get the last one till the next round, which is really cool. Overall it’s a solid agent, really fun and refreshing (🤣) yet balanced so it won’t get completely killed in the first nerf. I think best new agent since gekko 
Maybe?
her voicelines just tickle smt in my head thats not a good thing, idk why
Apart from all the bigotry and players who've never touched a smoke in their life, clove is a fantastic character. Decay can fuck people over so quickly it's not even funny
Great solo and team play. A bit basic tbh but that is also a plus. The fact it sees more play after release than Iso is enough proof Clove is good
I don't like her for the same reason i dont use brim. I main omen most of the time, exclusively use viper on breeze and icebox, and occasionally pick harbor and astra.
Because she requires getting kills in order for her utility to be effective then she is not as good as other agents in her role, I would pick Omen over her 100% of the time. Just like Reyna to me.

Not saying she is not fun to play tho.
    Omen is harder but 100% better for the team as a solo Controller tbh, his blind and tp is so annoying to deal with
    No not really, its only one ability that does the rest work well before kills with smokes and decay orb, not at all like reyna who kinda does need kills to be useful at all
I like clove but usualy betwen my friends we always pick her as 2 smoker(works rly good w omen)
    She's good as a second smoker, and entry, but definitely not with Omen/Brim/Astra. More like second to Viper/Harbor, on specific maps.
        Why not omen?
            They work fine together, but double dome smokes is usually worse than a wall. Its not their fault, wall is just REALLY good rn
            She basically work in place of omen in the "omen + viper/harbor" team comp. It's not omen specifically, it's any controller with dome smoke
Buff clove nades pls
The amount of people misgendering them one month in is disheartening.
    Do you think people know about it?
        They do. This entire thread is intentionally changing natural speech to include as many pronouns as possible whether they’re practicing using correct pronouns, or intentionally misgendering because edge or whatever. Don’t be dense.
    A lot of people just don't even know, but I see a few comments intentionally misgendering them which is very weird
    Seek help
    Oh she's a boy?
        Keep yourself safe :)
i’d main them but the smoke range being so small is off putting after playing astra and omen the range is significantly shorter i get it for balance reasons but yeah bc i like the rest of their kit but you need to be so proactive if u want to use them as solo smoker
    her range while alive is actually pretty big. her range while dead however is pretty small and is 100% reasonable considering she’s the only agent with any value after death.
She is fun but the teammates that pick her are dumb stupid
The vast majority of Cloves in my games are Reynas who don't want the pressure of playing entry/first contact and have no idea how to smoke. Clove is also in about 75% of my games, which makes the game more boring utility wise when you also take into account that Reyna + Jett will also be instalocked. Further, I also really dislike overheal as a mechanic. While it is nowhere near as frustrating as it is on Reyna, who can do it multiple times and also lasts longer, I just don't like going up against heavy shields on pistol round. We have 800 creds for a reason, IMO.

A bit ranty, sorry. Glad you're having fun with them, though, even if I think they're largely a detriment to the game. I like the ability to smoke after death!
    I think the overheal is quite balanced, you can easily wait it out and it's only overheal (in contrast to reyna getting health and overheal). That's just my opinion tho
    Overheal is fine imo, so is the rest of her kit. But I do agree with you on the first part, Clove to me feels like yet another soft throw agent with the people playing her on breeze and icebox and not knowing how to play controller at all. This is still happening in mid immortal ~100/300rr, no oneways, no blind like omen either, It really feels like you are already losing out on alot when Clove gets instalocked.
As a smokes main, I love the agent but hate the meta of people instalocking her almost every single game that it has created. Most maps I still want to play Omen/Viper because they clear Clove. I just like to sprinkle her in a bit when I’m bored, but since others are locking her almost every map, I have found myself on Cypher duty a ton since her release. Playing Cypher bores the hell out of me.
    Start insta locking ur smoke mains before clove😭 Every man for themselves and if they do insta lock before you on a map like Lotus or breeze which can use double controller, ask ur team if they don’t mind
        Yeah I was and they still lock Clove, and then on most maps we have a very unnecessary double controller comp with some important piece of utility missing. This is Diamond elo by the way. I miss being able to isntalock Omen/Viper and not having to worry about someone else locking in another controller. Seemed like what use to be Sentinel players are now just locking Clove in this elo, and Cypher is way too strong currently to just not have him most of the time.
            Ah yea I understand what you mean, especially w the forced Cypher pick and the lack of utility. Im Plat elo currently and I can admit that I was the ex-Reyna main locking Clove, but I used to main Omen at some point, so I wanted that taste of controller again with aggressive util. My thing is now its becoming a bit scary since ppl are starting to shy away from choosing duelist now as much as they were before, now that Clove has been introduced. I think that now that the duelist mains have gotten experience on Clove they started playing less aggressive agents. There have been plenty of games where I was the only duelist on maps with 2 duelist meta, like Bind. In some instances we pulled it off but due to having 2 sents on attack at times...there's not much you can do.
my current main, they are fun and useful but as solo smokes it can be annoying because of the limited range sometimes I feel like I’m forced to play mid or gamble, love playing her with a viper or omen on the team as well so I can play her more like a pseudo duelist.

her ult is super hit or miss, if you have teammates up and you’re hitting site and die it can be great, but it’s damn near useless in a 1v1 and also if you’re on any sort of lurk without anyone to play off of.

Overall I like the versatility, especially for solo queue, not sure what their place will be in comp but I would love to see them used in high level pro play.
    I think the ult is good in 1v1s if ur confident in ur aim duels and have a wall to hide behind
        if the enemy is not stupid though in a 1v1 they can just run from you unless they have to protect/defuse post-plant or something you just die.
            Most 1v1s the spike is down and if u ult in both situations then its pretty decent but it wont be good when theres no time
I love clove. Allows me to play aggressive yet able to provide more support to myself and my team. (I usually play duelist) Except the one bug where you kill it and the image of it still remains on the screen.
In my opinion, Brim became an even weaker controller due to Clove.
She got a lot of good abilities. People were saying she was a little OP at the start, but she seems nicely balanced. The instant heal is a full heal though, that could be adjusted a little. To maybe a max of 125 like having light shield instead of full shield. I like her style, and the smokes help a lot. They do see a bit bigger than most smokes though. Comparing them to Brim's smokes anyway. Fun post. Thanks for that.

    Why the quotations around ppl? It’s completely fair  to correct a small mistake
        very clearly why the quotations around people. just ignore this bigoted pos
        Oh boy so much backlash. Tbh i have a very bad habit to use quotations dont think much of it. And i didnt mean to offend you guys but demn going after me
    Guy just casually corrects it and there was 0 drama. I guess your fake outrage nonsense will have to wait for the next thread.
        Complete newbie and I just discovered Clove is nb.
This is so based.
    wow I completely forgot about Clove being nb that's my bad, I edited the post

To be fair, it's not something that comes up in-game at all so it slipped my mind
        Also not a real person so really it's okay lmao
            Omg y'all so soft in this sub.
    [removed]
        That's not what free speech is buddy
        That’s not what free speech means at all…
SHE is great! HER abilities feel awesome. Just feel people tend to troll when they pick HER :(
I think the only thing that needs nerf is the cost of her overheal. The fact that she can get both smokes a ghost and overheal on pistol is a little ridiculous IMO. She’s also one of the cheapest agents overall in terms of util.
Clove feels a bit too strong if im being honest. Kinda weird how 2 controllers are Trans lol
    2?
        Clove & Omen
            Omens trans?
                Yeah he was human now he shadow. He live in shadow. He fight in shadow. He kills in shadow. He is the *shadow*
                TRANSHUMAN 🦿🦾⚫🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥 DENY THE FLESH EMBRACE THE SHADOWS ⚫⚫⚫⚫
                Could be coded as trans, since we don't know his original gender. But it's pretty obvious that he is a CIS male
                    I was joking. BUT HE IS TRANSHUMAN, so there's a lot to play with here lol
                    It's not really, what makes it obvious he's cis? All the agents could be trans unless any of them was stated to be cis, and picking the shadowy smokey guy that doesn't show any skin to call "confirmed cis" when none is is weird
Clove is a boring agent filled with Riot cookie cutter value tools to make her "viable". Their extreme static kit makes it very unlikely to see any play at the professional level. A full and uninspiring agent that doesn't change the way the game is played at all really in contrast to other controllers. (A strategic death is NOT that hard to accomplish at all) Clove is disappointing as an agent gameplay wise and doesn't make Valorant any more VALORANT.

Clove smokes are just value. Because smokes are such an low skill floor but high value tool they make Clove viable but in a lame way. The decay suffers the same weaknesses as Iso Vulnerable and the better the player base gets the easier it will be to punish. The heal is powerful and ultimate as well but all the abilities are so restrictive in contrast to other controllers. Clove is a very selfish agent who should be initiating fights first but obviously that wont be consistent in your games...

Visually Clove is great.

Thematic wise Clove is mid, the voice actor really carries the character otherwise they'd be really lame like Deadlock or Neon. Like Clove trying to give the suck to Reyna because Clove is immortal is just pretty dumb imo
You can use her as an excuse to why you have the most deaths though.
    Great idea
She's decent enough and also fun but just not suited for me. I'm so used to teleporting across and blinding people that I can't like the idea of a controller x duelist. She's good overall but not my kind.
She’s Ight at best in my opinion. Best part of her kit is her smokes which even then omen and astra are still better as solo dome smokers but then again if she had smokes as good as theirs while also being able to use them while dead she would be absolutely broken. The Q is some dogshit without competent teammates to combo stuff with it and the heal is good but not great at the same time and her ult is definitely a good idea and was executed well just feels way to annoying to play against especially in a 1v1. However that what is it 12 seconds? You have to get a kill/assist is really good for balance. But yeah overall she’s fun and her design is cool and she’s decent but at the same time I’d rather play omen.
It's a better Omen when you play with the team, a worse Omen when playing solo.

It's a fun agent tho, I like the Reyna aspect of the gameplay a ton
    They have no similarities outside of placing smokes and even then his smokes have way bigger range.

Omen is also way more team oriented than Clove.
        Nah, they are very similar. They're aggro smokers, and it's a tricky one. Controllers can't be aggro all the time because smokes are valuable, so they have a hidden mechanic i call "aggro windows". 

Omen uses misdirection to create the aggro window. You usually lurk so you go in when the enemy turns their back. You need to use your team's pressure and then you can flash and have the possibility to tp out if the aggro window is over and you're stuck there.

Clove is Omen but you entry instead of lurking. You don't actually entry every round, but you can on some rounds where your only value is smokes and your body. Your aggro window is the fact that you won't lose your recharging smokes if you die on site, instead of Omen's team pressure and misdirection, and it's going in after a kill and using Pick Me Up (because you need to fight quickly or the overheal will go away + the speed boost makes fighting favorable). Clove is easier imo bc you can just use all your abilities and go make sure you are in front of your teammates because they will lose their abilities when they die, and that situation is easy to create
In terms of ranked, I would put her just behind Raze, Jett, Omen and maybe Chamber. Jett and Chamber are great for awping, which can be op. Omen is more versatile but I feel like it can go either way. Some people, myself included will just perform better on Clove no matter what.
I like clove…she’s not a game changing agent like gekko or something but she’s fun
yeh i love playing clove, she was meant for my playstyle
I like Clove it fits my Omen main play style but I am waiting for her to be nerfed first before using her more often because she will get nerfed inevitably
    What do you think will get nerfed?
She's cool. I really like her kit. I feel that the time for you to react to activate her ult is a tiny bit short. I'd increase that by 50% and make it so that enemy smokes look a bit different. Other than that she's well rounded :)
She got me to Plat from hardstuck gold 3 so definitely 10/10
Raze nade + decay = sudden death. My silver ass got aced from rushing A main on Lotus with that combo
    and that's EXACTLY why you don't push out until you are SURE that raze doesn't nade on lotus. helps to tell your teammates too
        I always warn my teammates and they still rush out and get naded 😐
            i guess it's not your fault then lmao, not sure what you could do tho
                Use Astra and suck your teammates back before they go out to die
                    unfortunately they can run out too fast, to where you'd be either missing them or pulling them into the nade. a sage wall appears to be the most logical solution that i can think of
            Neon players mad because teammate who can't get to the other side fast enough block us when we run past it (we can make it 10/10 times we just don't because Skye's and Phoenix's jump in front of us and kill our momentum)
        unless you're chamber
            fair
    Happened to me too but with an added fault line for extra brutality
My friend mains brim, we pair the decay with the Molly. *chefs kiss*
Isn't this every agent?
    Hate breach love the players
    Hate breach love the players
    Hate breach love the players
    Hate breach love the players
    Hate breach love the players
Clove players always smoke for the enemies, like smoking off main when attacking. I'm silver so maybe it's not the case in higher ranks.
    nah definitely still is the case lol, at least in Plat 3, my clove making one ways for the enemy, and their clove straight up smoking their own entries
Eventually they'll either learn or quit.

I hope.
There's a slight chance that more people will know the basics of smoking after clove got mega popular, at least :D give it a few months and maybe even the fill omen on your team isn't shit
    Love this optimism, one can only hope this is the case 😅
I'm trying to play viper on some maps it's nice having an instalock smoker until they don't use their E at all
Bro how hard is it to smoke without leaving a gap, and they still do it wrong like wtf
yes the description uses them pronoun
    Ah that makes sense then, thanks
Yeah, the original post used she/her pronouns until someone pointed it out so I changed it, forgot they're nb
    Cool, thanks for clarification
Yea
Yeah, Cloves enby!
I play with my game in French sometimes (I’m mostly bilingual) and it’s the first time I’ve seen the French word “lel” which is the nonbinary pronoun (equivalent of they/them) - I had to look it up at first but I found it interesting! We actually have it easy in English because they/them already serves this purpose
[removed]
    I'm not judging, I genuinely wanted to know
        yea, no binary btw
Roll for initiative always gets me
    Ahhah shit, I lost my pet roooock
        Fade's mind games are not match for my secret weapon, ibuprofen
« Would you look at that? They lost AGAIN! »
NAT 20! Love that.
The way they say “Critical Hit!” really tickles a part of my brain
Yall arent even getting the best one. “Find the weakest link and kickem’intheshin”
Ikr ? I really love their vibe
Hi ✨😇 Bye 🔥👹
only one that i really don’t like is “i know what we should do… we should win”
Nah sometimes you got to fight it, that timer for her to get a kill last way longer than you expect. But yeah you get the kill from afar just run
    Lmao bro is just trynna get a reaction 😂🫵🏼
        You high or something?
        I don't think bro is but if bro is you just gave bro one
            Bro got the broaction
What do you mean? It dies after a few seconds or something ?
    Clove needs a kill or damaging assist shortly after reviving or they just die again.
        If I had a dollar for every time I’ve lost a game in ranked because clove ults and someone tries to fight her, I could buy the battle pass.
Clove's nb and therefore THEY're ok
She? Oh nah theyre gonna ban u 😭
Yep, ive been instalocking bc im sick of getting smokes that help the enemy more than the team 😭
They still have the chamber launch ptsd, and every new agent since then has been launched underpowered
    Yeah, honestly Clove feels like the most balanced agent upon release for a while.
Just based on soloqueue stats, probably needs some sort of nerf.

My guess would be on the ult. Too much value.

Hard character to balance though, Kit on paper doesn't seem too strong.
    Ult is fine just run and u good
    >Just based on soloqueue stats, probably needs some sort of nerf.

What stats u referring to
        Clove has the highest win rate out of any agent in almost every rank, even higher than pre nerf chamber
    Maybe just give her 8 ult points instead of 7. They did that to a lot of agents so I wouldn’t be surprised if they do it with her.
        the nerf is probably going to her c and q, not her ult. Her ult isn't providing as much value as people think, hitting it would be like hitting Raze on her ult.

Pick me up probably will be getting price hit or duration hit, could be a bit of both

Meddle will also probably get hit in the Decay duration.
            Tbf theyve hit raze on their ult directly a ton, and changed some maps (bind) specifically to also make her ult worse.
                I think I'm bad at metaphot but. Raze nerf hit hard on her E, C, Q. No one really give too much heck on her ult point getting up to 8 bc her kit was the real meat.
    I think they're just popular on soloqueue because they're a really versatile agent with smokes as well. Really good for soloqueue tbh but I don't think they're overpowered
    smokes shouldn't recharge on death, or only allow one smoke while dead. only nerf they really need
    I would also have said a few small nerfs instead of buffs. But maybe Riot will wait and see how they are played in Pro Play before they make any changes.
    Probably the only Nerf I can see is add some additional conditions to the ult somehow. Cus honestly ult is the highest value utility by far. Cost increase could be viable too
are we playing the same game? Clove needs NERFS, not buffs. It's literally the agent with the highest win % in the game and it's not even close.
I wanna see her used in pro play, probably won't see that for a while tho :(
    i doubt they’ll see lots of play… they’re a very self sufficient agent *when* they get kills, akin reyna and iso who both aren’t played either
        If they pick Clove it will be because they can smoke while dead.
        I would disagree as even with kills, clove isn't very self sufficient, as she doesn't have the un-tradeability of reyna with dismiss, and also her heal goes away very quickly and doesn't even leave you with full normal health like reynas does. Just a take
    I don't think Clove will get many (if any) appearances in pro play at all, they're just not better than Viper and/or Omen who dominate the meta for quite a while now.
        Yeah omen can be more aggressive with the blind and tp. Clove can do that with self rez and boost, but omen smokes are better. As for viper, her ultimate is really good to take control of site and not to mention her molly that is useful post plant
        omen is 100% better in pro play because of freedom of smoke and range  
omen can better one way on a lot of stuff that clove can't

tp can be a pressure by just having it or make play, can bait enemy and create space for team too  
blind is superior and have better aoe than clove decay  
both c and ulti can have high pressure in map

but i'd just play clove because it's easier to smoke  
can one way on a lot of stuff by just point click than having to aim mode  
fast and accurate, c is easy to use  
x can always have value  
i don't care much about q but it's really useful and sometimes not need  
so i can spend on gun instead of that if sometimes i don't have enough money

smoke after dead is good for me too  
i can enter with friend and don't care if i would die or not and team will still have smoke around that area
        take the "(if any)" out of your message. she will. (she might not be great, but she will)
    Maybe next time? I don’t think the most teams will swap their controller agents with clove. But I do think we will see some teams try it
    TenZ said he’ll use Clove in pro play once they’re allowed and their bugs are fixed.
Another plus is that they’re much more fun to play than other controllers for the players who like to be aggressive, downside is no pee break
Tge fact that ppl not give a fuck about a video game characters pronouns is even a concern to you is fucking hilarious. Wait till you have real problems to deal with in life
    For NB people like me, people like you who invalidate our identities and don't care to use our preferred pronouns are actually a real problem we deal with!
        I didn't invalidate ur identity. Stop making things about yourself.
    most empathetic mature valorant player right here folks
        Waaaaaaaaa waaaaaaaaa my casual game has to be my way only and everyone else is dumb
        Me not showing empathy to a not real person? War crime honestly
            you're invaldating represention  and validation for a minorty group coming from a place of ignorance or malice, I would say that's unempathetic
                Don't attribute malice to indifference to video game character identity. If it looks like a girl, ppl will call her a girl. Cuz it's not targeted at an actual person, if u chose to get offended on the fake person's behalf than that's a personal problem u need to speak to a therapist with. Goodluck.
its a game who cares about the pronouns in casual game sessions?
DON'T RESPECT THE PRONOUNS LMAOOO. who cares? 
I hate those leftists so much. IT IS JUST A CHARACTER. 
"-they are on A plant
Team rotates to A and see a Clove"
    What?

"He's on A". 

Who? That's not any more useful. If you can determine the agent's gender, tell your team which agent? If you can't determine who it is, call out the numbers? "One A long" would be the call-out in this situation. 

"He's on A, plant" isn't a real call-out; there's no world, unless you're avoiding the site Aspas is on, where you call for a plant when you see only one player. 

The only context you really use a character's pronouns is when giving additional information, and they/they pronouns don't actually impact that. "Sova lit; they're top site".
    Clove is on A

Problem solved. Not that hard.
        It was just a joke.
            Schrodinger’s douchebag
            There's no pun or humour... Okay though.
    That's the teams fault for a poor call-out, you should always use the name of the character(s). Or if it's sound, say the amount. You are angry at a video game character's pronouns due to a skill issue? Life must suck for you then.
    Wow, yep, you really got them, great job 'owning the libs', you're so smart, I wish I could be so witty
    Dawg it’s just a fictional character, why are you so worked up on pronouns
        No one can answer this question lol, mixing feelings and emotions and weird shit into a game makes me wonder how smart some people are
        Exactly - it's just a fictional character. What the point of "respecting the pronouns"
            It’s just respecting the meaning behind it. If you don’t care about it then don’t say anything. Unless it’s clearly damaging something
            Well it would be a bit weird if someone insisted on refering to Reyna as a guy or Brim as a girl wouldn’t it? You respect the gender of other characters, so why not Clove too
                Maybe bcs this creature looks like a girl?
                Because it’s easily determined. If a child who had no knowledge of the life’s good barbecue people was shown every valorant agent and was asked if it was a boy or girl it would say Jett, Reyna, Clove, Etc. are all girls and Brimstone, Phoenix, and Chamber, Etc. are all boys.
                    Maybe the point of NB representation is so all those children have one more opportunity to discover we exist? Should we also make all the characters white because some child maybe never seen a person that isn't white? 

What's the correlation you're trying to draw between "MAYBE a child hasn't seen X" so "not include X in valorant"? Children haven't seen soul sucking latinas, hopefully, so maybe we delete reyna? Children haven't ever seen floating islands IRL so delete ascent!
                        That’s not what I said nor what I intend by what I said and don’t make this racist and what the fuck do you mean by delete ascent because children have never seen floating islands irl. I am fine with NB rep as I don’t care I am simply making a statement about how a child is going to not notice or probably care that a non binary character exists.
                        And just to add my own perspective into this, why do you “need representation” im not saying you “don’t have rights” or you need to be executed for being different but why do you need representation through a video game and why force that ideology onto people that either are against it or don’t care
                            Non-binary people need representation so people can see that they are just regular human beings like anyone else, especially since transgender people are being used as political scapegoats right now.
                                First off, 90% of people see nb  and trans people as regular people or just don’t care or say anything. I personally don’t care just don’t shove it in my face and force me to like you. Second off, where in the hell are trans people being used as political scapegoats?
                        Also there’s no “correlation” im trying to draw between “child never seen x so don’t include it”
a good harbor is scary .. on the other hand 75% i’ve played are seriously smooth brained
    Trust me … I 1 trick  viper for almost 2 years now and was initially excited when harbor was first released until I saw how underpowered (and the worst part is how team reliant he is . )
As harbor you can have the best set ups on attack and defense wall/ smoke everything off but if your team doesn’t follow up you’re screwed . 
Harbor is the only agent in game where his smokes create a negative status effect on team mates (the slow effect ) 
I went from diamond 1 to bronze trying to play harbor only  in ranked. 
There’s only 1 serious harbor player in radiant that streams on YouTube and he stopped playing him because there’s so many other better agents .
There’s a reason why he’s sitting literally at the bottom of the character select pick rate of all agents
        honestly not a bad arguement, and yeah i see him played maybe once or twice a day. nothing more.
    Also his ult is shit and last so little of time , also is team reliant and it’s hard to guarantee  a kill off of it
just 1.5s shorter than omen smoke, not much different imo

sometimes i want smoke disappear faster too like viper who can manually wall up down  
too long smoke also make i harder to push into my own smoke and do something  
like when i one way early just to take space or burn enemy util  
and let my team take space on other part of map  
sometimes i want to push asap after i spotted them somewhere else
    Also her smokes pop faster and are easier to do. (Plus can do 2 at once, unlike Omen)
You can terminate it prematurely by hitting x
    I’m talking the kill timer
        That seems really short, doesn’t it? It’s only like two seconds you can decide. If anything I would like them to extend it a bit so that way you can almost bait the enemy team and stall triggering it
They'll probably be shit in proplay unless ppx does some weird shit, but I'm very glad they released an agent for actual players. I'd like to think we deserve at least some agents that aren't tailored for competitive
their outfit is so cute!!
If your after death smokes are selling your teammates you shouldn’t be playing smokes anyways bc ur selling while alive.

Overheals great for rotate/pushing further on site

Almost every ult is situationally good, and forcing enemies to run away for 15 seconds is amazing value.

Honestly iPad smokes are so much harder for me than omen, because half the time when you smoke you’re moving and I can see gaps when I place omen smokes and fine tune it instantly where I can’t for clove(have to exit and re enter smokes)

Smoke range is fine unless on breeze, icebox, or lotus. Rest of games either it’s not a big deal or u should have cypher who can stall on defence for smokes to get there.

Ngl im not seeing the brim over clove, and viper has been the number 1 smokes since she first came to meta I think.
Turned into a new low elo stable along with reyna
Omen is harder but 100% better for the team as a solo Controller tbh, his blind and tp is so annoying to deal with
No not really, its only one ability that does the rest work well before kills with smokes and decay orb, not at all like reyna who kinda does need kills to be useful at all
She's good as a second smoker, and entry, but definitely not with Omen/Brim/Astra. More like second to Viper/Harbor, on specific maps.
    Why not omen?
        They work fine together, but double dome smokes is usually worse than a wall. Its not their fault, wall is just REALLY good rn
        She basically work in place of omen in the "omen + viper/harbor" team comp. It's not omen specifically, it's any controller with dome smoke
Do you think people know about it?
    They do. This entire thread is intentionally changing natural speech to include as many pronouns as possible whether they’re practicing using correct pronouns, or intentionally misgendering because edge or whatever. Don’t be dense.
A lot of people just don't even know, but I see a few comments intentionally misgendering them which is very weird
Seek help
Oh she's a boy?
    Keep yourself safe :)
her range while alive is actually pretty big. her range while dead however is pretty small and is 100% reasonable considering she’s the only agent with any value after death.
I think the overheal is quite balanced, you can easily wait it out and it's only overheal (in contrast to reyna getting health and overheal). That's just my opinion tho
Overheal is fine imo, so is the rest of her kit. But I do agree with you on the first part, Clove to me feels like yet another soft throw agent with the people playing her on breeze and icebox and not knowing how to play controller at all. This is still happening in mid immortal ~100/300rr, no oneways, no blind like omen either, It really feels like you are already losing out on alot when Clove gets instalocked.
Start insta locking ur smoke mains before clove😭 Every man for themselves and if they do insta lock before you on a map like Lotus or breeze which can use double controller, ask ur team if they don’t mind
    Yeah I was and they still lock Clove, and then on most maps we have a very unnecessary double controller comp with some important piece of utility missing. This is Diamond elo by the way. I miss being able to isntalock Omen/Viper and not having to worry about someone else locking in another controller. Seemed like what use to be Sentinel players are now just locking Clove in this elo, and Cypher is way too strong currently to just not have him most of the time.
        Ah yea I understand what you mean, especially w the forced Cypher pick and the lack of utility. Im Plat elo currently and I can admit that I was the ex-Reyna main locking Clove, but I used to main Omen at some point, so I wanted that taste of controller again with aggressive util. My thing is now its becoming a bit scary since ppl are starting to shy away from choosing duelist now as much as they were before, now that Clove has been introduced. I think that now that the duelist mains have gotten experience on Clove they started playing less aggressive agents. There have been plenty of games where I was the only duelist on maps with 2 duelist meta, like Bind. In some instances we pulled it off but due to having 2 sents on attack at times...there's not much you can do.
I think the ult is good in 1v1s if ur confident in ur aim duels and have a wall to hide behind
    if the enemy is not stupid though in a 1v1 they can just run from you unless they have to protect/defuse post-plant or something you just die.
        Most 1v1s the spike is down and if u ult in both situations then its pretty decent but it wont be good when theres no time
Why the quotations around ppl? It’s completely fair  to correct a small mistake
    very clearly why the quotations around people. just ignore this bigoted pos
    Oh boy so much backlash. Tbh i have a very bad habit to use quotations dont think much of it. And i didnt mean to offend you guys but demn going after me
Guy just casually corrects it and there was 0 drama. I guess your fake outrage nonsense will have to wait for the next thread.
    Complete newbie and I just discovered Clove is nb.
This is so based.
wow I completely forgot about Clove being nb that's my bad, I edited the post

To be fair, it's not something that comes up in-game at all so it slipped my mind
    Also not a real person so really it's okay lmao
        Omg y'all so soft in this sub.

    That's not what free speech is buddy

2?
    Clove & Omen
        Omens trans?
            Yeah he was human now he shadow. He live in shadow. He fight in shadow. He kills in shadow. He is the *shadow*
            TRANSHUMAN 🦿🦾⚫🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥 DENY THE FLESH EMBRACE THE SHADOWS ⚫⚫⚫⚫
            Could be coded as trans, since we don't know his original gender. But it's pretty obvious that he is a CIS male
                I was joking. BUT HE IS TRANSHUMAN, so there's a lot to play with here lol
                It's not really, what makes it obvious he's cis? All the agents could be trans unless any of them was stated to be cis, and picking the shadowy smokey guy that doesn't show any skin to call "confirmed cis" when none is is weird
Great idea
They have no similarities outside of placing smokes and even then his smokes have way bigger range.

Omen is also way more team oriented than Clove.
    Nah, they are very similar. They're aggro smokers, and it's a tricky one. Controllers can't be aggro all the time because smokes are valuable, so they have a hidden mechanic i call "aggro windows". 

Omen uses misdirection to create the aggro window. You usually lurk so you go in when the enemy turns their back. You need to use your team's pressure and then you can flash and have the possibility to tp out if the aggro window is over and you're stuck there.

Clove is Omen but you entry instead of lurking. You don't actually entry every round, but you can on some rounds where your only value is smokes and your body. Your aggro window is the fact that you won't lose your recharging smokes if you die on site, instead of Omen's team pressure and misdirection, and it's going in after a kill and using Pick Me Up (because you need to fight quickly or the overheal will go away + the speed boost makes fighting favorable). Clove is easier imo bc you can just use all your abilities and go make sure you are in front of your teammates because they will lose their abilities when they die, and that situation is easy to create
What do you think will get nerfed?
and that's EXACTLY why you don't push out until you are SURE that raze doesn't nade on lotus. helps to tell your teammates too
    I always warn my teammates and they still rush out and get naded 😐
        i guess it's not your fault then lmao, not sure what you could do tho
            Use Astra and suck your teammates back before they go out to die
                unfortunately they can run out too fast, to where you'd be either missing them or pulling them into the nade. a sage wall appears to be the most logical solution that i can think of
        Neon players mad because teammate who can't get to the other side fast enough block us when we run past it (we can make it 10/10 times we just don't because Skye's and Phoenix's jump in front of us and kill our momentum)
    unless you're chamber
        fair
Happened to me too but with an added fault line for extra brutality
Hate breach love the players
Hate breach love the players
Hate breach love the players
Hate breach love the players
Hate breach love the players
nah definitely still is the case lol, at least in Plat 3, my clove making one ways for the enemy, and their clove straight up smoking their own entries
Love this optimism, one can only hope this is the case 😅
Ah that makes sense then, thanks
Cool, thanks for clarification
I'm not judging, I genuinely wanted to know
    yea, no binary btw
Ahhah shit, I lost my pet roooock
    Fade's mind games are not match for my secret weapon, ibuprofen
Lmao bro is just trynna get a reaction 😂🫵🏼
    You high or something?
    I don't think bro is but if bro is you just gave bro one
        Bro got the broaction
Clove needs a kill or damaging assist shortly after reviving or they just die again.
    If I had a dollar for every time I’ve lost a game in ranked because clove ults and someone tries to fight her, I could buy the battle pass.
Yeah, honestly Clove feels like the most balanced agent upon release for a while.
Ult is fine just run and u good
>Just based on soloqueue stats, probably needs some sort of nerf.

What stats u referring to
    Clove has the highest win rate out of any agent in almost every rank, even higher than pre nerf chamber
Maybe just give her 8 ult points instead of 7. They did that to a lot of agents so I wouldn’t be surprised if they do it with her.
    the nerf is probably going to her c and q, not her ult. Her ult isn't providing as much value as people think, hitting it would be like hitting Raze on her ult.

Pick me up probably will be getting price hit or duration hit, could be a bit of both

Meddle will also probably get hit in the Decay duration.
        Tbf theyve hit raze on their ult directly a ton, and changed some maps (bind) specifically to also make her ult worse.
            I think I'm bad at metaphot but. Raze nerf hit hard on her E, C, Q. No one really give too much heck on her ult point getting up to 8 bc her kit was the real meat.
I think they're just popular on soloqueue because they're a really versatile agent with smokes as well. Really good for soloqueue tbh but I don't think they're overpowered
smokes shouldn't recharge on death, or only allow one smoke while dead. only nerf they really need
I would also have said a few small nerfs instead of buffs. But maybe Riot will wait and see how they are played in Pro Play before they make any changes.
Probably the only Nerf I can see is add some additional conditions to the ult somehow. Cus honestly ult is the highest value utility by far. Cost increase could be viable too
i doubt they’ll see lots of play… they’re a very self sufficient agent *when* they get kills, akin reyna and iso who both aren’t played either
    If they pick Clove it will be because they can smoke while dead.
    I would disagree as even with kills, clove isn't very self sufficient, as she doesn't have the un-tradeability of reyna with dismiss, and also her heal goes away very quickly and doesn't even leave you with full normal health like reynas does. Just a take
I don't think Clove will get many (if any) appearances in pro play at all, they're just not better than Viper and/or Omen who dominate the meta for quite a while now.
    Yeah omen can be more aggressive with the blind and tp. Clove can do that with self rez and boost, but omen smokes are better. As for viper, her ultimate is really good to take control of site and not to mention her molly that is useful post plant
    omen is 100% better in pro play because of freedom of smoke and range  
omen can better one way on a lot of stuff that clove can't

tp can be a pressure by just having it or make play, can bait enemy and create space for team too  
blind is superior and have better aoe than clove decay  
both c and ulti can have high pressure in map

but i'd just play clove because it's easier to smoke  
can one way on a lot of stuff by just point click than having to aim mode  
fast and accurate, c is easy to use  
x can always have value  
i don't care much about q but it's really useful and sometimes not need  
so i can spend on gun instead of that if sometimes i don't have enough money

smoke after dead is good for me too  
i can enter with friend and don't care if i would die or not and team will still have smoke around that area
    take the "(if any)" out of your message. she will. (she might not be great, but she will)
Maybe next time? I don’t think the most teams will swap their controller agents with clove. But I do think we will see some teams try it
TenZ said he’ll use Clove in pro play once they’re allowed and their bugs are fixed.
For NB people like me, people like you who invalidate our identities and don't care to use our preferred pronouns are actually a real problem we deal with!
    I didn't invalidate ur identity. Stop making things about yourself.
most empathetic mature valorant player right here folks
    Waaaaaaaaa waaaaaaaaa my casual game has to be my way only and everyone else is dumb
    Me not showing empathy to a not real person? War crime honestly
        you're invaldating represention  and validation for a minorty group coming from a place of ignorance or malice, I would say that's unempathetic
            Don't attribute malice to indifference to video game character identity. If it looks like a girl, ppl will call her a girl. Cuz it's not targeted at an actual person, if u chose to get offended on the fake person's behalf than that's a personal problem u need to speak to a therapist with. Goodluck.
What?

        Yeah he was human now he shadow. He live in shadow. He fight in shadow. He kills in shadow. He is the *shadow*
        TRANSHUMAN 🦿🦾⚫🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥 DENY THE FLESH EMBRACE THE SHADOWS ⚫⚫⚫⚫
        Could be coded as trans, since we don't know his original gender. But it's pretty obvious that he is a CIS male

            It's not really, what makes it obvious he's cis? All the agents could be trans unless any of them was stated to be cis, and picking the shadowy smokey guy that doesn't show any skin to call "confirmed cis" when none is is weird

            unfortunately they can run out too fast, to where you'd be either missing them or pulling them into the nade. a sage wall appears to be the most logical solution that i can think of
    Neon players mad because teammate who can't get to the other side fast enough block us when we run past it (we can make it 10/10 times we just don't because Skye's and Phoenix's jump in front of us and kill our momentum)
unless you're chamber
    fair
yea, no binary btw
Fade's mind games are not match for my secret weapon, ibuprofen
You high or something?
I don't think bro is but if bro is you just gave bro one
    Bro got the broaction
If I had a dollar for every time I’ve lost a game in ranked because clove ults and someone tries to fight her, I could buy the battle pass.
Clove has the highest win rate out of any agent in almost every rank, even higher than pre nerf chamber
the nerf is probably going to her c and q, not her ult. Her ult isn't providing as much value as people think, hitting it would be like hitting Raze on her ult.

Pick me up probably will be getting price hit or duration hit, could be a bit of both

Meddle will also probably get hit in the Decay duration.
    Tbf theyve hit raze on their ult directly a ton, and changed some maps (bind) specifically to also make her ult worse.
        I think I'm bad at metaphot but. Raze nerf hit hard on her E, C, Q. No one really give too much heck on her ult point getting up to 8 bc her kit was the real meat.
If they pick Clove it will be because they can smoke while dead.
I would disagree as even with kills, clove isn't very self sufficient, as she doesn't have the un-tradeability of reyna with dismiss, and also her heal goes away very quickly and doesn't even leave you with full normal health like reynas does. Just a take
Yeah omen can be more aggressive with the blind and tp. Clove can do that with self rez and boost, but omen smokes are better. As for viper, her ultimate is really good to take control of site and not to mention her molly that is useful post plant
omen is 100% better in pro play because of freedom of smoke and range  
omen can better one way on a lot of stuff that clove can't

tp can be a pressure by just having it or make play, can bait enemy and create space for team too  
blind is superior and have better aoe than clove decay  
both c and ulti can have high pressure in map

but i'd just play clove because it's easier to smoke  
can one way on a lot of stuff by just point click than having to aim mode  
fast and accurate, c is easy to use  
x can always have value  
i don't care much about q but it's really useful and sometimes not need  
so i can spend on gun instead of that if sometimes i don't have enough money

smoke after dead is good for me too  
i can enter with friend and don't care if i would die or not and team will still have smoke around that area
take the "(if any)" out of your message. she will. (she might not be great, but she will)
I didn't invalidate ur identity. Stop making things about yourself.
Waaaaaaaaa waaaaaaaaa my casual game has to be my way only and everyone else is dumb
Me not showing empathy to a not real person? War crime honestly
    you're invaldating represention  and validation for a minorty group coming from a place of ignorance or malice, I would say that's unempathetic
        Don't attribute malice to indifference to video game character identity. If it looks like a girl, ppl will call her a girl. Cuz it's not targeted at an actual person, if u chose to get offended on the fake person's behalf than that's a personal problem u need to speak to a therapist with. Goodluck.
It was just a joke.
    Schrodinger’s douchebag
    There's no pun or humour... Okay though.
No one can answer this question lol, mixing feelings and emotions and weird shit into a game makes me wonder how smart some people are
Exactly - it's just a fictional character. What the point of "respecting the pronouns"
    It’s just respecting the meaning behind it. If you don’t care about it then don’t say anything. Unless it’s clearly damaging something
    Well it would be a bit weird if someone insisted on refering to Reyna as a guy or Brim as a girl wouldn’t it? You respect the gender of other characters, so why not Clove too
        Maybe bcs this creature looks like a girl?
        Because it’s easily determined. If a child who had no knowledge of the life’s good barbecue people was shown every valorant agent and was asked if it was a boy or girl it would say Jett, Reyna, Clove, Etc. are all girls and Brimstone, Phoenix, and Chamber, Etc. are all boys.
            Maybe the point of NB representation is so all those children have one more opportunity to discover we exist? Should we also make all the characters white because some child maybe never seen a person that isn't white? 

What's the correlation you're trying to draw between "MAYBE a child hasn't seen X" so "not include X in valorant"? Children haven't seen soul sucking latinas, hopefully, so maybe we delete reyna? Children haven't ever seen floating islands IRL so delete ascent!
                That’s not what I said nor what I intend by what I said and don’t make this racist and what the fuck do you mean by delete ascent because children have never seen floating islands irl. I am fine with NB rep as I don’t care I am simply making a statement about how a child is going to not notice or probably care that a non binary character exists.
                And just to add my own perspective into this, why do you “need representation” im not saying you “don’t have rights” or you need to be executed for being different but why do you need representation through a video game and why force that ideology onto people that either are against it or don’t care
                    Non-binary people need representation so people can see that they are just regular human beings like anyone else, especially since transgender people are being used as political scapegoats right now.
                        First off, 90% of people see nb  and trans people as regular people or just don’t care or say anything. I personally don’t care just don’t shove it in my face and force me to like you. Second off, where in the hell are trans people being used as political scapegoats?
                Also there’s no “correlation” im trying to draw between “child never seen x so don’t include it”
honestly not a bad arguement, and yeah i see him played maybe once or twice a day. nothing more.
That seems really short, doesn’t it? It’s only like two seconds you can decide. If anything I would like them to extend it a bit so that way you can almost bait the enemy team and stall triggering it
They work fine together, but double dome smokes is usually worse than a wall. Its not their fault, wall is just REALLY good rn
She basically work in place of omen in the "omen + viper/harbor" team comp. It's not omen specifically, it's any controller with dome smoke
Ah yea I understand what you mean, especially w the forced Cypher pick and the lack of utility. Im Plat elo currently and I can admit that I was the ex-Reyna main locking Clove, but I used to main Omen at some point, so I wanted that taste of controller again with aggressive util. My thing is now its becoming a bit scary since ppl are starting to shy away from choosing duelist now as much as they were before, now that Clove has been introduced. I think that now that the duelist mains have gotten experience on Clove they started playing less aggressive agents. There have been plenty of games where I was the only duelist on maps with 2 duelist meta, like Bind. In some instances we pulled it off but due to having 2 sents on attack at times...there's not much you can do.
Most 1v1s the spike is down and if u ult in both situations then its pretty decent but it wont be good when theres no time
Omg y'all so soft in this sub.
Omens trans?
    Yeah he was human now he shadow. He live in shadow. He fight in shadow. He kills in shadow. He is the *shadow*
    TRANSHUMAN 🦿🦾⚫🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥 DENY THE FLESH EMBRACE THE SHADOWS ⚫⚫⚫⚫
    Could be coded as trans, since we don't know his original gender. But it's pretty obvious that he is a CIS male
        I was joking. BUT HE IS TRANSHUMAN, so there's a lot to play with here lol
        It's not really, what makes it obvious he's cis? All the agents could be trans unless any of them was stated to be cis, and picking the shadowy smokey guy that doesn't show any skin to call "confirmed cis" when none is is weird
i guess it's not your fault then lmao, not sure what you could do tho
