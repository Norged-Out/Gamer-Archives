[[Why is this community so weird about lower ranks]]


Let's say someone posted a video of them getting an ace. Within seconds, the post is flooded with comments saying 

"Cool but this is max silver elo" 

"Must be easy when enemies don't shoot back"

"This wouldn't be possible in MY elo" 

And I just don't get the point of it? If OP is a silver player and is getting an ace in a lobby of silver/gold enemies - that's impressive FOR THEM. They're effectively killing 5 people of their skill level in 1 round. 

Of course they wouldn't be able to do it in immortal lobbies - they never said they could! 

I like this community but it feels like some people think anybody below immortal is the equivalent of a monkey playing on a PC. Like relax buddy - you're still good at this game even if a low elo player made a play they're proud of.


Its just ego and the need to feel like theyre better at the game than others, which is obvious cos they're in a higher rank. Its the same as why people smurf
    This game has by far the biggest ego problem of any game I've played and that includes Dota
        100% it’s full of absolute weirdos
            Meowing, barking, getting mad if you ask for util, racists, sexists and all sorts. The last two are less common than in CS, but there's definitely more weirdos in Val that aren't just pieces of crap lmao
                Its FPS without the real-sim crowd to keep them checked. Sometimes it's a good thing (more relaxed), sometimes it's not (more immature).
                I had a viper on lotus in ranked who would only play on C, when the enemies kept rushing A and B, and used their wall solely to cover main and waterfall. I asked nicely if they could possibly play B and use their wall across b main and A to delay their pushes. Asked, didn't say, and said please... They proceeded to never place their wall even for retake for the rest of defence - Lovely!!!
                    You were probably playing with Crip Mac.
                        The Custers didn’t keep it 55th by pushing A & B instead of C
                    Well if viper held c on her own and you guys couldnt hold a or b together then its clearly a skill issue
                        Viper was on C every round when they never attacked C, so I asked if they could do walls that cross A-B or B-C since they were our only smokes. Meant only C was ever covered with smokes, and on 3 site maps the viper wall becomes OP when you can cover two out of three sites. 

As I said, they proceeded to stop using the wall at all when I asked them to switch it up so they weren't holding shit. Plus, as I said, the enemy pretty much only pushed A/B and when they did push C viper died before we could rotate. Stopping all util use when asked to do something different is not an appropriate reaction in a team based game, and playing from the same location with the same util setup is not a good thing in Val. 

We could hold site to a point, but the wall stops hard rushes way easier than anything else especially on an already attacker sided map like Lotus. This was like, 3 months ago though and bronze lobbies so it's not like anyone is skilled at those ranks lol.
                Got lucky last night in a ranked match and had the other team ff after 5 rounds, 2 of my teammates were a weird e-couple and another guy was doing weird “what the sigma” voices the entire game.
        Have you seen league? 5 seconds into the game and someone’s fragile ego will explode
        Interesting, I feel like every competitive game there are plenty of people with egos and elitism. Same goes for things other than games as well
        Ah a man of culture
        Idk man… Dota is  pretty bad
        I mean, ego is bound to be a big part of any competitive game. If you develop a system that ranks players accordingly to their skill, and clearly differentiate players of different skills with shiny rank icons, it gives players of a higher skill level a reason to feel superior to other players, and even make it part of their personality in some cases.
    Don't you know the number one rule of competitive games? Everyone worse than you is trash noob and everyone better than you is no life sweat
    Do you know the I'm Iron One guy? One of the best val content creator
        Are u saying that hes smurfing? I thought hes just playing unranked
            I believe he keeps his unranked MMR ungodly low on his account, his videos are funny but also I feel bad for those players. It must be annoying to get absolutely toyed with them instantly 1 tapped because you're that much worse.
                yea hes came out and said it before, he plays swift plays and unranked games to get his clips
            No he ain't
        You talking about the bathtubboba guy?
    almost every immo+ player has big ego bc you kinda need it to reach a rank like that
    People smurf because they have smoll pp
    For me the reason is that its just boring. I dont mind a nice clip once in a while but this subreddit is 90% of clips and people crying about something. Would be nice if there is more educative, funny and e-sports content rather then fishing for compliments and flaming the game/players. Imagine a football subreddit were amateur players post videos were they score medicore goals all day instead of getting clips were messi plays against ronaldo in the el clasico. Would be super annoying and boring.
    Not this community. Every community is like this. Every COMPETITIVE game forums will be like this. This ranges from every eSports game to every ball game. It’s human psychology at this point since we are desensitized to knowing a skill ceiling (watching pro players play). If a play is not “optimal,” it’s not good because there is presumably so much mistakes that can be improved on from a viewer’s POV.

        I mean they can be proud of something without thinking theyre the best player in the world or deserve to be a significantly higher rank. Do you tell people at the gym they shouldn't be proud for benching 1 plate because other people can bench 2? And do you then tell those people they shouldn't be proud of benching 2 plates cos other people can bench 3?
            Those are 2 different things.
If one of my teammates in soloq get an ace, i'm cheering.
If a stranger post an ace, I don't fucking care.
If someone at the gym bench 1 plate I mind my business.
If my bro bench 1 plate and never benched before, I'm cheering.
        oh boo hoo this kid 50 ranks lower than me got 5 kills in one round i cannot let that slide how dare he feel accomplished and enjoy the game normally
        Thank you so much for being exhibit A
        you sound so weird rn bro, some people just wanna share clips, why do you feel the need to put them down
            I don't. I don't care, I said "people". I'm not people.
        Nah that's a bad take, there's a difference between being proud of something and wanting to show people and doing it because of ego or to inflate your ego
Had someone flame me when i was iron, he was bronze
    hes got a point though /j
    To be fair I've yet to comprehend that people actually have the skill level of iron, even as beginners, no reason to flame someone for it, ig I just don't understand that some people genuinely way less talent than most. I know people who've been stuck in Iron 1 for months and I genuinely just wonder how, no amount of advice helps them either
        because val is a lot of people’s first FPS. it takes a while to adjust.
            It's not that I don't understand that, I just don't understand anything below iron 3 at the least, valorant was my absolute first game on pc except like cool math or something and I started at bronze 1 and never dropped to iron, I actually played with some iron friends and the shenanigans I witnessed... idek how to describe. I honestly started to admire them lmao, to be so bad at a game yet still somehow enjoy it and have fun is something I'd just never be able to do, I'd have to quit if I was that bad and incapable of growth
                yeah it’s not that deep for most people. but again. a lot of people started gaming in covid with ZERO gaming experience. console or pc.
                    Fair enough ig
                I think it's also a lot of people playing on either horrible gaming setups or horrible ping (or both), which explains why it looks so weird.
                    That's what I thought too but after fixing my friends setup and internet there was still no improvement lol, and im sure for many that is the case
        I got stuck in Iron 3 for like 2 act.  Valorant was like the very first competitive shooter for me, so I need to learn a lot of stuff at that time. No offense, but based on me being in the same rank, all I know that a lot of Iron don't really have the most basic gamesense (crosshair placement, footstep, angle, etc.) Which is why this rank exist. Eventually, I got out of there and able to reach Plat 2 this act after 2 years. (I didn't play much lol)
            Yea, I think a lot of them literally look at the ground as they walk....
Lots of players are toxic gamers who are still teens and kids, they have yet to grow up and even some adults haven't, so they all end up with a big ego since Valorant is the only worthwhile achievement they had made.
    some are adults with minds of preteens aint gonna lie 
Im hesitant to post any Val content anywhere for this reason. My best clips are met with the weirdest criticisms. I had a clip with four one tap ghost kills and someone got mad that I wasn’t strafing enough, in one tap kill gunfights? Like I didn’t strafe enough after killing them I guess, even though they were 1v1 fights? And trying to reason with these guys is impossible
    As others have said, most of these players are teen kids and have really huge egos. Over that, you have to understand most of the people with big egos are not used to someone "disagreeing" with them. When they grow up, they will realize how stupid they were.
        No they wont.  Most of these kids you speak of are grown ass adults that act like children.
    gotta ignore them, movement matters but not as much as actually hitting your shots
I'm guessing its because people like talking down and looking down on others so they can feel superior
I dont care about what rank it is personally. But not every ace is “good” or “cool.” Obvious ones being the last kill is unnatural, like your teammates are dying just so you ace.
    If it’s unrated I’m cool with teammates baiting for the ace. But I can’t even begin to count the number of times my team has thrown rounds in ranked just because a bunch of players were bhopping around for someone to get the last kill.

If I get a 4K in ranked I’m telling my teammates to play it safe. Absolutely no reason to risk throwing an already won round and end up on YouTube (INSANE 1v5 ACE CLUTCH)
        i've lost rounds because of this, now i will always repeat 'i dont want the ace, kill him if you see him' to my team if i get 4. my (likely mediocre) clip is not worth losing elo over lol
        Correct, I do this too. Like I said I dont even want the ace unless its natural, just feels so wrong to me personally. Winning the round with the least amount of casualties > unnatural ace. Its the difference between winning and losing games. Too many players underestimate how much a good economy is needed.
            Precisely my point. Yeah you get the clip but at what cost - 3 rifles? So now your team has to eco the next round
            Just tell them to hide or back up and you go look for them
                No. Thats also unnatural and dumb.
    I will just take the ace just to make them cry lol, it's not really a good ace if you let 1 person get the last kill
don't forgot those people who act as if diamond is "low rank"
    Honestly the most infuriating types. Top 10-15% of the playerbase is low rank? Some dumbass on my last post here had the audacity to call ascendant dogshit yet is IN ascendant. Like what is bro smoking? 🤣🤣
    Bro it literally is

/s
        Guess people ignore tone indicators :(
            redditors ignoring tone indicators moment
        Dw bro, the people got your message, honestly, I should've been the one to comment this, it is so true 🤣🤣🔥!
        You do know that diamond id the 3rd highest rank? And was the 2nd highest for around 2 years? Most people (65%?) are on bronze-gold tier, and for diamond, there are not that many players (5%?).

Dont misunderstand by watching twitch streamers.
            I was joking, hence the /s
                Mb, I thought you weren't joking because of the dislikes.
                doesn't /s stand for serious?
                    no /srs is serious
            If you go by the average player, yes diamond is quite high. However, It is about middle of the pack if you want a non linear scale that can actually tell the difference between say lower immortal and higher immortal somewhat intuitively. In other words, if all nba players or F1 drivers are 10s, yes diamond is high quite high. But going from 9 to 10 doesn't feel enough of a difference when taking about say Jokic and an average Euroleague player or a bench warmer. Or say Ocon and Verstappen. That is why people use a non linear scale to tell the difference and in that sense diamond is not very high. 

And I highly doubt most people do it to see themselves as better, it is often because they have a lot of mistakes to iron to do to get to the top. But I have to admit some do it do belittle others, for sure. And they are jackasses. 

The second reason is average player, like the average person, or average student is quite bad at anything. I think anyone who worked a people facing job can agree with that. Idk about US system prior to higher education, but is 1150 considered a decently good SAT score? Though it is by definition above average. I genuinely don't know. All I know is that SATs aren't everything when it comes to admissions and that's quite good for relieving stress from people. I wish I had that back up back when I was prepping for exams, or rich/connected parents that get me in anyway. But I digress.

TLDR: Belittling people for rank is dumb regardless of them being above average or not. But there are valid reasons to use a non linear scale, like showing the difficulty of getting to a certain rank in a way that makes more sense.
                I get what you mean, but by measuring with averages, diamond is quite high.
                    just bo point in doing that when u are talking about the skill of a player
                literally no one on earth would do this in a linear way. the reason people think diamond is low elo is dogshit youtubers and people like wooj who are like "oh wow youre diamond and made THIS mistake? time to retire buddy" when the player fat fingered a light shield instead of a full on a full buy
    Well because it is compared to them. This happens on every game in every single rank. The rank below theirs is always 'low rank'. Although to be fair it does depend how much higher they are, maybe ascendants shouldn't be calling diamond low rank.
        and immortals are low rank to pro players, so? even among radiants there's noticable difference, and upper radiants definitely smack immos, so is radiant the only rank that isn't low now?
    Diamond is mid elo, plat is low elo
It’s a competitive shooter. Of course you have people in this community who have fragile egos and can’t let others be happy.

I mean, you ever queue a comp game? 🤣🤣 

Seriously this community is dogshit tho
idk man stay humble, everyone has bottom fragged, why does no one jus relate instead of hate.
    This !
insecurity and desire to flex. literally it.
The same reason they smurf. Stroke their ego. Funny thing is, if you ain't getting paid then we're all in the same boat, casual players.
Same goes for High rank player's that play swift play and then try hard and then start spamming how trash other's are...
    Lmao quite the opposite happens with me, I am a little higher rank than others and when I play swiftplay or unrated to chill, the other kids with tracker or something  start trashtalking me saying how boosted I am for my rank when they kill me or are winning the unrated
I was in my full gold lobby with 1 plat on my team, I was top fragging with him and he kept backseat gaming and chatting sht to our teammates even tho we were winning. I could hear in my teammates voices that they werent feeling too good about the vibes and we started losing our momentum.

The plat player (cypher) kept making silly comments how can my "sht teammates only hold site when I'm there" or "this is gold elo, not plat, just shoot them."

I had enough so i told him too keep quiet because he is plat but he ended up in this gold lobby so his MMR or hidden rating is clearly low and he should drop his ego.
    all of my lobbies are mixed with golds and plats and im pretty sure theres not much difference and some plats struggle to hit easy shots and some golds aim like they play deathmatch for hours everyday
        Yea ofcourse, but this was a full gold lobby and he was plat 2. I know there will always be a mix, the main issue was his ego and making the team feel like shit. It was unnecessary the unnecessary comments from him
            yeah thats the problem he is like one rank above yall and thinks he is like immortal
Idk unpopular opinion but I think it’s cool they’re proud of an ace or clip but it really is just kinda lame and boring if the clip is super low elo cause it’s like the mechanics are ugly, enemy players are incompetent etc. There’s a reason why a lot of the most watched streamers tend to be good at the game. It’s entertaining to watch ppl of high skill. 

I think if you’re proud of a clip like that definitely by all means show it to friends and family but if you post it in a big public forum ppl are naturally gonna be more critical, especially if the clip isn’t exceptional.
it's hard as f to rank up in valo and especially in this act, so people are gonna look down on lower ranks AS MUCH AS THEY CAN.
    Esp solo queue is really bad this act
    Really? I've gone from b1 to G1 with a flat 50/50 win rate this act
    I went from gold 3 to diamond 1 with only +5 W/L so I don’t know what you mean
        "My experience isn't this, therefore it is WRONG" lmao
cuz anything below their rank is garbage, duh
Yeh and in yt shorts too i see clips from small channels that are obviously low rank. There will always be a comment saying "bronze aim 😂" or "bro cant stop crouching" etc
How do you main astra
Garbage community made of people who consider that hitting the highest elo is the most important thing in their lives, so they need to belittle low elo players
Im silver and I don't give a shit.
    This is what I aspire to be.
        I mostly play with my friends and even they don't take it seriously. We're just chilling and having fun and laughing most of the time. One time one of my friends in ascent B site 1v1 situation playing sova randomly shot a shock dart into the site and started to move towards the site, when he was in the site the shock came bouncing from somewhere and fucking killed him. It was so freaking hilarious.
            It's definitely easier with friends. There are days my mental can't handle solo Q comp. My duo is two ranks above me so we can't comp. but we're pretty chill when we play.
It is just people beating on other people's happiness because they can't do well in their own lobbies anymore and instead of improving themselves they project onto others, putting other people down for not being of a high elo
Nahh you like the community? I’m ashamed to play this game with all these cringe ass e daters
    Fr val prolly has top 3 ahittiest community of all games....
no matter how high of a rank you become the people with more fragile egos will say something. i’m diamond and i’ve heard “the enemies don’t even shoot you” and “they would never play this shit against me”, from people who are in MY RANK. there is no escaping this ever in a community of insecure people.
Ego: people "need" to think they're better than they really are, so if someone is better, they're cheating (or a sweaty nerd in a basement), and they can't be "slightly better" than somebody: if someone else has a lower rank, it means they're **crushing** them ("lower is trash, higher is cheating/nerds")



And... The knowledge about lower ranks is astoundingly inexistant...  
When "iron" is being said, half of the time, it's "waw, this move was so shitty, it's iron/plastic tier!"... "Bro, I'm iron, and I can confirm it's at least silver".  
And the other half is "Iron players are so dumb they don't even know they have to shoot to enemies, duh!"... Seriously?  
It's always wrong, but either an extreme or the other...  
Real iron players (i.e. excluding smurfs and trolls) just can't aim/have long reaction times/have their brain mildly off when they play because they play after a tiring day/don't have a healthy enough routine (my case, I have a freaked up sleeping cycle, so I'm always exhausted when playing...)/have medical issues affecting their reactions/etc...
This may be unpopular at least in this particular comments section, but honestly if there are clips on the sub I want them to be amazing instead of average... it's why I don't post my clips lol
    That's fair - I'm mainly wondering why people feel the need to comment hateful stuff on those clips
        A lot of criticism stems from the feeling of "I wanted this clip to be amazing" but yes if it's hateful or disrespectful to the player I don't agree with what they're saying.
This happens to me in my ascendant clips I assume its either plat players who aren't good or eu players who are even worse lol
Personally I don't care about the rank if the clip is cool or has a mechanical aspect to it. Like good movement, snappy flicks. Lower elo clips tend to not have that and feels more like a child showing their parents the art they made using pasta, some paper and glue. 

There's nothing wrong with being proud of a clip or ace that you got, it's just when you post it online people aren't going to have the same connection to you as your friends might, so will probably be a lot more critical and negative.

I'm fairly mid at the game but when I hit a flick that feels super clean and fast to me my friends go crazy even though In reality it's nothing special, it's just above my standard which makes it special. I'm yapping
Something like 90% of the players in the game are silvers. This sub is nothing but silvers currently. Everyone climbs the ranks at some point before taking a break, all come back to being silvers on rank decay and for most their skill is that of a silver now too. These competitive shooters aren't made to play casually to stay good. It's why the low ranks are a mess of skill now. 

Then you have people that do nothing but watch others play and criticize. They have no skill or ability at the game. They are the ones that join matches tell others how to play while they are dead, yet when they are last alive have 0 clue as to what to do.
By the logic underlying these dismissals only aces that take place in the finals of a professional Valorant event would be legitimate.
I think a lot of the stigma comes from what is normal in the gaming community. Generally people will not post clips of them beating easy stuff, just hard stuff. Like in geometry dash for example. Beating a top 50 extreme demon is much more impressive than some random easy demon. It doesn’t mean the achievement is bad per se, it’s just awkward when you post something like hey look at this crazy achievement I got, when it is really not that difficult to get. I think hating on people is weird and uncalled for. But also the people posting their ace in bronze and bragging about it are weirdos too.
    why are u comparing geometry dash and valorant lmao.. i dont find playing an extreme demon for 25000 attempts amusing at all  and theres a lot of gd youtubers who post non demon or easy demons too 
        It’s just a game where completing a hard vs. easy achievement is objective rather than subjective. 

I don’t care what you find amusing that’s irrelevant to the conversation. 

Of course there are people who post those. But they aren’t posting it on the subreddit bragging about how good they are like a silver might do.
            its just cringe man, my 8 year old brother beats demons like its nothing do why bother mentioning a random rhythm game like gd or osu and making a sad analogy
                How is GD cringe? Clearly you do not understand my analogy so instead you choose to attack it.
    But - for the silver elo OP who got an ace in a silver lobby - that was hard for them. That's the thing I think people don't understand. Unless OP is a literal smurf, then the clip wasn't something easy for them to do (and likely why they posted it)

Your comment is exactly what I'm talking about. An immortal will see the clip and say "huh??? That was so easy" - no shit for you it would be easy. It's like people forget there are different skill levels in this game
        I understand it was hard for them. This is exactly what my post is talking about.

The reality is something that is hard for a silver player to do is not generally impressive. 
Is it impressive for THEM? yes. 
For the average person on r/valorant? No. 
Am I saying they shouldn’t post it? No.

The main issue is when there is bragging or ego or just lack of self awareness.

Like when I see a notification and the title is “Insane 6k clutch” and the person proceeds to commit sins like insta crouch sprays into 3 people, it just gets annoying.
Simple, pure ego, it's like this in every Comp game you play towards lower ranked players, not just the Val community.
this isnt just in valo, but also lol and other games, sometimes ots justified, like when you make a really bad and risky play thst works, but then you should be friendly about criticising them and not insulting em
I feel this has spawned from my post xD
>If OP is a silver player and is getting an ace in a lobby of silver/gold enemies

Most of the time the comments are implying that the person is smurfing and if that's the case honestly they deserve the hate. I don't doubt there are many players who intentionally play in lower elo to farm clips.
I never shared an ace before because I know it won't be that impressive and most of the time its the fault of the enemy. 
Plus its the internet. If you don't want to be criticized, ask yourself if the video is good enough
Once had a dude said he smurfs my peak just said i smurf your social interaction peak
because sometimes OP is a smurf who goes into lower lobbies to get those clips. thats why
It's a result of competive games and it is the same as riots other game league of legends, despite majority of the player base being in lower elos there's a thought process that lower elo players "don't know how to play the game" and they get memed on. In truth lower elo/ average players don't play the game effeiciently in order to consistently win, just like your average chess player isn't going to know the best strategy to consistently win matches. It's nbd can be annoying sometimes cuz ppl get egos about their rank but otherwise doesn't matter most players are low elo or slightly above
Honest question, is it fine to say tips and a commend???
If people shoot back you're not acing on high elo either... people lose track of enjoying the game and try to make it worse for everyone else ig.
in almost all ranks, but from what i’ve experienced mainly plat and higher everyone is so toxic and egotistical you just can’t do anything unfortunately. For me ascendant was the worst you literally get flamed for doing anything especially on London and Frankfurt servers🫠
The crazy thing is you have people being cocky that are only in gold rank or plat….its like dude do you not realize there are several ranks above your also shitty one?
Never do that, but I put it down to one simple reason.

Smurfing is possible in lower ranks. A gold player might still have shitty aim but can ace easily in a silver or bronze lobby against worse opponents but it's harder to tell a gold/silver is smurfing in a bronze/iron lobby.

If you ace in Immortal/Radiant, well you're at the peak of the game. You cant really be smurfing.

I'm sure if a pro player came here and posted his own Ace on Reddit against an Immortal lobby you would have the same sentiment of people saying "Post your aces of pro games not pug lobbies"
im like gold-plat only but honestly even tho something like diamond or asc is low for high immo players i really think diamonds and asc players look like they know what theyre doing somewhat and its not like an ace in plat is that unimpressive because by that rank people usually grasp the concept of head level crosshair placement etc
It's any competitive community. I was in another game's subreddit a while back and after I gave an opinion, someone asked for my tracker. They said my opinion didn't matter unless I was high elo, (which I actually was, unlike in Valorant haha).
Like Gadget said, its all ego but also people get off to belittling other people’s accomplishments
This EXACT situation is what happened to me. Posted an ace video here where I was alone as clove VS the other five players and people just... Flamed me

"cardboard rank"

"shit rank"

And even insults to my personal dm??

Like, guys. I wasn't saying I'm better than anybody. I KNOW I'm a bronze player. But damn, I can't post a video of a play I'm proud?
Haha you must be referring to the Ace posted earlier today and basically every top comment was either shitting on OP for their smoke placement or saying this is gold elo. I really I agree people on Reddit just love shitting on others and bringing them down. Even if it were an immortal player that posted that Ace people would still say “why can’t the enemies in my games whiff like that” or some other condescending bullshit.
often people will see posting their clip as bragging and people dont like that.
Uplifting people is a lot harder than the reverse.
Dick comparison competition, mostly those diamond/ascendant fucks who think they are some big shit commenting like that instead of actual advices
i had someone call me every swear word in existence that was higher rank than me because i was "trash" dawg i dont even speak
meanwhile my stupidly goofy aces that i cant record cuz shit pc

my aces usually are the enemies walking into my crosshair, earlier i caught 4 ppl with crosshair placement then raze rpg allahu akbar the last guy
Because people don't watch clips to see someone ace in a silver lobby. People watch clips to see players at a high level pull off impressive feats using above average mechanical skill. The same reason nobody would care about clips of a little league baseball team, yet millions watch the MLB. The lower the skill level, people don't care, because it isn't impressive. Even if it's "impressive for them", nobody cares? And why would they?
    If they don't care then why leave those types of comments?
        Well that's simple, they're toxic and it's the internet.
Yup the classic everyone below me is a noob while everyone above me has no life. Just focus on having fun and making personal progression.
That’s the problem with this game, there’s only one mode and it’s competitive. Funny clips are always enjoyable, but when the clip is meant to be impressive and it’s not, some people get triggered.

I would never comment something rude, but I’m gonna be honest, I usually don’t care to see aces from people below plat or dia because they are usually mid.
I try not to have ego since I am not that great but if I plan out a stupid strategy against players my skill level, and it works! You better believe I’m saying,”I’m the best, I’m going pro, sen better sign me!”
mire high the elo gets, the ego is jus pathetic
You would never see someone post this in my rank
You answered your own question… it’s impressive to them. Not to us. No need to post an iron 1 clutch is there
It’s because of streamer culture. Every top streamer parrots this same line “something along the lines of anything below immortal is trash or low elo” and then obviously the kids who play this game are just going to repeat it nonstop.

I’m platinum 3 with 22 wins this act and in a few of my games I get called hardstuck low elo player by players that are barely a rank higher. Makes no sense.
Srsly like im kind of new, (this was like 3 months ago) and i get my first ace, so i post it and the first comment says “iron gameplay at best” like bro tf
I think you're asking a rhetorical question
Bro, you literally just answered your own question. If a diamond player looks at a silver players Ace. They aren't going. "Oh wow, that's pretty impressive." they are saying "wow that must've been very easy." Low elo aces are only impressive to low elo players, but low elo players have bad aim, so the Ace looks messy to higher elo players. Gotta accept the fact that low elo Aces are trash compared to higher elo Aces.
i’m in college and work a part time job, I probably only get to play once or twice a week, so sorry i’m just trying to enjoy a video game.
most are too bad to notice the difference between Silver - Platinum are so minimal.
It goes both ways. IMO it is weird to post your ace to the internet and expect everyone to praise you fort it. If you only want those comments that praise you, then you shdnt be on the internet.
    I've seen plenty of comments that offer constructive criticism though. Those are really good. It's the people that feel the need to shit on the clip or ridicule OP for being low elo lmfao. If it makes you that mad, just keep scrolling?
You donot unterstand cause you are a low elo
Because there's a difference between an all luck ace/ enemy team throwing and an all skill ace.
    Unless youre smurfing any ace is the enemy fucking up and not properly trading you.
        That's just not true. You can trade 4 of your teammates, or use utility to isolate the enemy.
            How often do those happen though and even then they fucked up by not using their util to isolate any of your teammates
                It's still better than an Odin ace through smokes or someone getting kills from people not looking at them. I'd rather not see every ace post littered with those kinds of aces. If luck was the only factor in an ace, it's not worth posting.
                    Idk i think its fine. I care equally as little about all ace posts unless its in vct or a rare event like a penta raze rocket or brim ult or something
    Maybe, but what is there to gain by pointing it out other than being a prick?
50% the clip is genuinely not good and 50% sick of seeing so many “look at this ace i got clips” that I kinda don’t care about
    You're the type of person OP is talking about btw
        I don’t leave comments I get why you think I would tho lol, im just telling OP why some people do
            Well, you just left a comment, so
                Yeah Ik because OP was asking why people commenr if people leave a positive post I’m not gonna shit on them
                    Well that's good
    Yea bro this is why u solo queue and get no bitches
        Huh? Projection?
People aren't impressed with things that are supposed to be skillful, that they could do better themselves.
    They could then offer constructive criticism or just keep scrolling. Feeling the need to comment hateful stuff is weird
        Posting things in a public forum but expecting only one opinion.

If you're so offended, just post to your Facebook so your mum can say good job, idk
Because when you're showing clips to other people they need to be objectively good, not subjectively good

Or you can just clip funny shit or bugs instead

Nobody wants to watch clips that are bad
    Damn, so nobody below immortal can post clips?
        That's exactly what I said word for word.
One of my favorite games. But the better part of the community that actually plays regularly are intolerable.
I kinda disagree. Lower ranks tend to be more inconsistent, but many can peak relatively high. Higher ranked players play in a way that makes getting an ace harder. This isn't to detract from their highlight, but there's a reason there's comparatively few aces in VCT.

At the same time there's no need to put down OP or point out it's silver or whatever. OP should be proud, but it isn't really the same difficulty of accomplishment, killing 5 equally ranked players in silver and killing 5 equally ranked players in ascendant.
    Sure that makes sense - but my point was mostly that it didn't make sense to make hateful comments towards those clips. I think it's easier to just ignore them if they're not "impressive" enough. Or at least provide some constructive feedback
You could ace with 1 HP on a radiant lobby and someone would still find a way to trash talk bc they're losers
especially when if your in silver your not necessarily bad, the game has a huge skill floor and higher skill ceiling,  id say silver to gold is a typical good player, i hate when higher elo players say that low elo is bad, no they arent, compared to high elo yes, but you cant just pick this game up and hit silver
Bro, you literally just answered your own question. If a diamond player looks at a silver players Ace. They aren't going. "Oh wow, that's pretty impressive." they are saying "wow that must've been very easy." Low elo aces are only impressive to low elo players, but low elo players have bad aim, so the Ace looks messy to higher elo players. Gotta accept the fact that low elo Aces are trash compared to higher elo Aces.
    Nobody's is saying you need to comment "wow that's pretty impressive" on those posts lmao. Just move on if you didn't like it. No need to go into the comments to stroke your ego and put OP down
        Everyone wants their clips glazed, but ain't no one want their clips shit talked. Comments are for posting your thoughts. If someone wants to type "Yo, that shit was hot ass." Then let a brotha type that. If those other players don't want to be put down, they should practice more so that they aren't average. At the end of the day, they are just stupid internet comments, so who really gives a shit.
Its okay if its inpressive for them, but then why post it. Posting it is asking for others opinions you cannot be mad when other people do give those opinions. Its good to be proud of yourself but when you post a clip people will only be interested if its genuinly interesting to watch for every rank. Ofc shit talking is childish and stupid but dont be surprised when you share something on social media and people give their opinions.
    >Its okay if its inpressive for them, but then why post it

Is there a requirement on this sub that only immortal+ clips can be posted?
I am s3 and just playing devils advocate here, but the odds for an ace are higher with lower elo. In asc or immo it’s just harder. The player is way better but their opponents don’t make as many mistakes. And usually it takes the other team making a lot of dumb mistakes to let an ace happen. Higher elo does quintessential things like swing together in 3v1. Or wait until their team mates are around to take fights. Or communicate in general. It’s still very impressive and exciting, to ace. But watching an ace where 5 people push one at a time with util out, or no awareness, is not the same as watching a big brain flicky ace. I’m happy for anyone to ace and would never talk shit. But the odds and impressiveness are not the same at my level vs good players.
this is not unique to valorant
because getting ace in silver is not the same as getting ace in higher elos. Its easier to shoot at standing targets, doesn't matter if the one shooting is low elo themselves. any achievement in low elo doesn't have any value.
    Username checks out
    Why do you think this is? Firstly, in silver they are moving, not so great movement, but still. Secondly, if the people can't aim all that well, then even these less good movements are making it significantly  harder to shoot at someone. By logic, for a silver player (which is the highest low elo btw) it is the same hardships to endure and come out victorious. It is just as hard as a radianite getting an ace. Sure, the objective skill difference is high, but the subjective difficulty is the same. By your logic, any achievement below radiant shouldn't count as achievement, just bc there would be a lobby where it could not be done by the player bc he's not good enough.
        they're silvers because they're not good enough at the game. which means none of their achievements are worth anything. an ace is silver is worse than a triple kill in high elo.
            So in the instances you see these clips on your feed, do you feel the need to go into the comments and shit on the OP, or keep scrolling?
            So can I ask you what do you consider 'high elo'? Since you are referring to it in every comment, I feel like we should establish a common base for the continuation of this debate. For me low is iron to silver, mid is gold-plat and high is diamond and up.

Also, what are you referring to when you say they are not good enough. What are they not good enough for? To enjoy the game, to experience a false and fragile ego based on one thing that they're probably not gonna do for a living or to unwind and get better or what? Do you consider a graduation a worthy achievement? Getting a diploma? Two? Three? Making 6 figures? Being happy with your life, content with yourself? What would you say is your achievements?
                diamond is not high elo. if you have ever played in an actual dia3 lobby you'd know. they're no better than plat when it comes to game sense. the only thing dia players have on plat is more confidence. gold and below are low elo, plat to asc2 is mid elo, asc3 to immo 2 is high elo, and immo3 to radiant is the best players.

its a competitive shooter. if you wanna "enjoy" the game, then maybe play unrated? players are divided into ranked for a reason. the ones who do not know how to play are always at the BOTTOM and rightfully so. who says you need to earn something to show your achivements. the fact is low elo players are nothing, they're just warmup fodder for higher elo players. anyone below diamond should uninstall the game anyway since they'll never be better, and they should play some other game where skill floor is lower. 

why play a shooter if you cant aim? why play an competitive game if you don't have the brains to think strategy? low ranks are just a waste of server space. not everyone should be playing fps.
    bro you're forgetting they're also silver, its good for them, for you not really but for them its impressive
    > "Doesn't matter if the one shooting is low elo themselves"

Why doesn't it matter? Silver players arent easily one tapping. I feel like a lot of yall lack basic empathy.
OP also weird for posting this. Like cmon weirdos and SJW are everywhere (I apologise if this is your first day in the internet).
    The internet is like that, yes. That doesn't mean you have to support people like these by saying it's normal because "iTs tHe inTErnEt". Idk if you saying that means you want the internet to stay a toxic place or if youre just straight-up stupid, but the people in communities can at least try to make the community a non-toxic place, even if it doesnt mean that it will affect the whole internet.
that's impressive FOR THEM hence they posted it, BUT IT IS NOT IMPRESSIVE FOR PEOPLE AT HIGHER RANK hence they are posting these things

what's exactly the issue? you want people to just lie with what they truly feel?
    No op is not saying to lie, op is saying don't be a fucking loser lmao.
        why exactly does saying what you actually think is a "fucking loser"
            If the sole purpose is tell a low elo player that they are low elo and you are better, you are a loser.
                how is telling them they are low elo from their silver elo ace mean "you are a loser"? 

you're talking as if telling them that they've only done it because its low elo is a bad statement when it isn't necessarily is.
                    It’s an entirely pointless comment to make, they obviously know what elo they’re in and it serves as nothing more than a way for the person commenting it to stroke their own ego
                        it can also tell them that they wont get away with this when you get to higher elos.

you sound very insecured of yourself that you take the comment negatively when it shouldn't really be
                            No I think it’s just that you’re very condescending and don’t realize how insufferable you sound. If you genuinely think someone posting an ace doesn’t know they wouldn’t be able to do that against people better than them then you’re as dense as a rock
                            Well, the person posting it probably wasn’t asking for advice though?? Why do so many people not realise that scrolling away is also an option and making prick comments isn’t necessary?
                            I'm 100% sure any silver player knows that their ace wouldn't be possible in a high elo lobby. What would be the purpose of telling them that other than to stroke your own ego? 

You are EXACTLY the type of person I made this post for
    Just because something isn't impressive to you doesn't mean you have to tell others. People aren't forcing anyone to comment on a silver clip, just let them enjoy their moment.
        its a discussion... lmao.

its basically asking the people on this subreddit "what do you think of this" unless the OP provided context at what they want, so why are you just going to scrolll when you actually think that this is unimpressive and is just low elo shit, when that's truly what you actually think?

if you don't want people to give negative inputs to you then don't make the post in the first place or tag it with "no negative inputs please" or something
            Unless the poster is specifically asking for your opinion in the title of a clip then no they're definitely not asking "what do you think of this", they're just sharing a moment they had. Weird take.
                its the opposite lol

there wouldn't even be a default comment section if what you're talking about i.e. just sharing hence not asking any input from the users of the sub is the default setup

pampered like a sheltered little princess take LOL
                    Real weird take... I never understand why people feel the need to take time out of their day to bring other people down. Not cool at all
    Or they could just ignore it and not comment.
        its a discussion... lmao.

            It's just a video game. You can let people be happy. 

It's very easy.
    You are not obligated to post every single thing you think on the internet actually
    or to just keep scrolling..? lmao
        its a discussion... lmao.

            Not how that works but alright
    One way GOOD communities exist is connecting through shared experiences. If you see a clip you can just think back to when you were in that rank and how you would have felt rather than now when your better. Typically its something they're proud of because they did better than usual and its important to support them getting better and having fun.

  
or you can just be upset that not everyone is better than you when you see a clip, your choice.
I am better therefore I will flex
    Nobody that is actually secure in themselves feels the need to flex by putting down other people
It's true though, anybody below immortal is like a monkey, you can easily reach Diamond with like an hour of aim training lol.  
But yeah, people gotta chill and let other people enjoy their achievement.

For everyone who's butthurt about this, what i mean is that in an ideal scenario where people have **time** (e.g no responsibilities at all), a **brain** (*to figure out what you need to improve on*), and determination, people can **EASILY** reach diamond.

The only reason diamond is top 8% or whatever is because atleast 2/3 of valorant players probably aren't that engaged or competitive.

You have people working jobs that probably doesnt think much about improving and just queuing rank, Teens with school etc.

  
Diamond-asc is not high elo, it's mid-elo.
    Delusional
    You disagreed and proved OPs point then said retracted initial statement and agreed. Majority of Valorants users are below diamond so clearly it really isn’t that easy..
    One hour of aim training puts you in the top 8% of players? lol
        That was just an exaggeration tbh.
I do believe though that if people actually put effort into improving, people can easily reach mid-elo.
Top 8% may sound impressive, but that's mainly because probably half of the playerbase doesn't really focus on improving due to real life circumstances or they're not as invested into.
You've got people queuing over and over again without thinking about what they could improve in.
    And the pros probably think all the immortals and radiants look like monkeys too. Most of them don't feel the need to stroke their ego online though
        I'm not stroking my ego though, im below immortal as well.
Even in Dia-Asc elo, there's a lot of people who acts like they're lost (including me).
There's rarely a strategy played in Ascendant soloq, it's turned into just a game of who spots each other quicker and shoots the head quicker.
            Doesn't matter what you say there is no reason to go spreading negativity on peoples posts when they're excited about something
                Yeah, that was clearly in my initial comment.
If you manage to kill 5 people within your skill level, that's impressive!
I'm just disagreeing with OP's other point.
    Just out of curiosity, what rank are you and how many hours do you have?
        Surely he wouldn't say something like that without being immortal and not a lot of hours right.. right?
            This comment would be worse if i was an immortal, as that would mean im just calling people below me as monkeys, but no. im not immortal.

I'm just being honest as someone within mid-elo. everyone (including me) has so many mistakes that we may as well just be called monkeys.

Again, im not hating on people posting clips, those are cool and impressive since they did those within their skill level, i'm just pointing out that everyone below immortal is actually like monkeys.
                Delusional, again.
        I'm not immortal, so this doesn't count as stroking my ego.  
I'm just being honest and realistic.
            Yeah lmao, completely agree with people in lower ranks (me) playing weirdly. I was just wondering if you are diamond or ascendant and how many hours you have because with a claim like that I would expect you would have reached ascendant in maybe a couple of days.
    im asc 3 and i can confirm im a instalock reyna legshot larry no comms chunky monkey
This game has by far the biggest ego problem of any game I've played and that includes Dota
    100% it’s full of absolute weirdos
        Meowing, barking, getting mad if you ask for util, racists, sexists and all sorts. The last two are less common than in CS, but there's definitely more weirdos in Val that aren't just pieces of crap lmao
            Its FPS without the real-sim crowd to keep them checked. Sometimes it's a good thing (more relaxed), sometimes it's not (more immature).
            I had a viper on lotus in ranked who would only play on C, when the enemies kept rushing A and B, and used their wall solely to cover main and waterfall. I asked nicely if they could possibly play B and use their wall across b main and A to delay their pushes. Asked, didn't say, and said please... They proceeded to never place their wall even for retake for the rest of defence - Lovely!!!
                You were probably playing with Crip Mac.
                    The Custers didn’t keep it 55th by pushing A & B instead of C
                Well if viper held c on her own and you guys couldnt hold a or b together then its clearly a skill issue
                    Viper was on C every round when they never attacked C, so I asked if they could do walls that cross A-B or B-C since they were our only smokes. Meant only C was ever covered with smokes, and on 3 site maps the viper wall becomes OP when you can cover two out of three sites. 

As I said, they proceeded to stop using the wall at all when I asked them to switch it up so they weren't holding shit. Plus, as I said, the enemy pretty much only pushed A/B and when they did push C viper died before we could rotate. Stopping all util use when asked to do something different is not an appropriate reaction in a team based game, and playing from the same location with the same util setup is not a good thing in Val. 

We could hold site to a point, but the wall stops hard rushes way easier than anything else especially on an already attacker sided map like Lotus. This was like, 3 months ago though and bronze lobbies so it's not like anyone is skilled at those ranks lol.
            Got lucky last night in a ranked match and had the other team ff after 5 rounds, 2 of my teammates were a weird e-couple and another guy was doing weird “what the sigma” voices the entire game.
    Have you seen league? 5 seconds into the game and someone’s fragile ego will explode
    Interesting, I feel like every competitive game there are plenty of people with egos and elitism. Same goes for things other than games as well
    Ah a man of culture
    Idk man… Dota is  pretty bad
    I mean, ego is bound to be a big part of any competitive game. If you develop a system that ranks players accordingly to their skill, and clearly differentiate players of different skills with shiny rank icons, it gives players of a higher skill level a reason to feel superior to other players, and even make it part of their personality in some cases.
Don't you know the number one rule of competitive games? Everyone worse than you is trash noob and everyone better than you is no life sweat
Do you know the I'm Iron One guy? One of the best val content creator
    Are u saying that hes smurfing? I thought hes just playing unranked
        I believe he keeps his unranked MMR ungodly low on his account, his videos are funny but also I feel bad for those players. It must be annoying to get absolutely toyed with them instantly 1 tapped because you're that much worse.
            yea hes came out and said it before, he plays swift plays and unranked games to get his clips
        No he ain't
    You talking about the bathtubboba guy?
almost every immo+ player has big ego bc you kinda need it to reach a rank like that
People smurf because they have smoll pp
For me the reason is that its just boring. I dont mind a nice clip once in a while but this subreddit is 90% of clips and people crying about something. Would be nice if there is more educative, funny and e-sports content rather then fishing for compliments and flaming the game/players. Imagine a football subreddit were amateur players post videos were they score medicore goals all day instead of getting clips were messi plays against ronaldo in the el clasico. Would be super annoying and boring.
Not this community. Every community is like this. Every COMPETITIVE game forums will be like this. This ranges from every eSports game to every ball game. It’s human psychology at this point since we are desensitized to knowing a skill ceiling (watching pro players play). If a play is not “optimal,” it’s not good because there is presumably so much mistakes that can be improved on from a viewer’s POV.

    I mean they can be proud of something without thinking theyre the best player in the world or deserve to be a significantly higher rank. Do you tell people at the gym they shouldn't be proud for benching 1 plate because other people can bench 2? And do you then tell those people they shouldn't be proud of benching 2 plates cos other people can bench 3?
        Those are 2 different things.
If one of my teammates in soloq get an ace, i'm cheering.
If a stranger post an ace, I don't fucking care.
If someone at the gym bench 1 plate I mind my business.
If my bro bench 1 plate and never benched before, I'm cheering.
    oh boo hoo this kid 50 ranks lower than me got 5 kills in one round i cannot let that slide how dare he feel accomplished and enjoy the game normally
    Thank you so much for being exhibit A
    you sound so weird rn bro, some people just wanna share clips, why do you feel the need to put them down
        I don't. I don't care, I said "people". I'm not people.
    Nah that's a bad take, there's a difference between being proud of something and wanting to show people and doing it because of ego or to inflate your ego
hes got a point though /j
To be fair I've yet to comprehend that people actually have the skill level of iron, even as beginners, no reason to flame someone for it, ig I just don't understand that some people genuinely way less talent than most. I know people who've been stuck in Iron 1 for months and I genuinely just wonder how, no amount of advice helps them either
    because val is a lot of people’s first FPS. it takes a while to adjust.
        It's not that I don't understand that, I just don't understand anything below iron 3 at the least, valorant was my absolute first game on pc except like cool math or something and I started at bronze 1 and never dropped to iron, I actually played with some iron friends and the shenanigans I witnessed... idek how to describe. I honestly started to admire them lmao, to be so bad at a game yet still somehow enjoy it and have fun is something I'd just never be able to do, I'd have to quit if I was that bad and incapable of growth
            yeah it’s not that deep for most people. but again. a lot of people started gaming in covid with ZERO gaming experience. console or pc.
                Fair enough ig
            I think it's also a lot of people playing on either horrible gaming setups or horrible ping (or both), which explains why it looks so weird.
                That's what I thought too but after fixing my friends setup and internet there was still no improvement lol, and im sure for many that is the case
    I got stuck in Iron 3 for like 2 act.  Valorant was like the very first competitive shooter for me, so I need to learn a lot of stuff at that time. No offense, but based on me being in the same rank, all I know that a lot of Iron don't really have the most basic gamesense (crosshair placement, footstep, angle, etc.) Which is why this rank exist. Eventually, I got out of there and able to reach Plat 2 this act after 2 years. (I didn't play much lol)
        Yea, I think a lot of them literally look at the ground as they walk....
some are adults with minds of preteens aint gonna lie 
As others have said, most of these players are teen kids and have really huge egos. Over that, you have to understand most of the people with big egos are not used to someone "disagreeing" with them. When they grow up, they will realize how stupid they were.
    No they wont.  Most of these kids you speak of are grown ass adults that act like children.
gotta ignore them, movement matters but not as much as actually hitting your shots
If it’s unrated I’m cool with teammates baiting for the ace. But I can’t even begin to count the number of times my team has thrown rounds in ranked just because a bunch of players were bhopping around for someone to get the last kill.

If I get a 4K in ranked I’m telling my teammates to play it safe. Absolutely no reason to risk throwing an already won round and end up on YouTube (INSANE 1v5 ACE CLUTCH)
    i've lost rounds because of this, now i will always repeat 'i dont want the ace, kill him if you see him' to my team if i get 4. my (likely mediocre) clip is not worth losing elo over lol
    Correct, I do this too. Like I said I dont even want the ace unless its natural, just feels so wrong to me personally. Winning the round with the least amount of casualties > unnatural ace. Its the difference between winning and losing games. Too many players underestimate how much a good economy is needed.
        Precisely my point. Yeah you get the clip but at what cost - 3 rifles? So now your team has to eco the next round
        Just tell them to hide or back up and you go look for them
            No. Thats also unnatural and dumb.
I will just take the ace just to make them cry lol, it's not really a good ace if you let 1 person get the last kill
Honestly the most infuriating types. Top 10-15% of the playerbase is low rank? Some dumbass on my last post here had the audacity to call ascendant dogshit yet is IN ascendant. Like what is bro smoking? 🤣🤣
Bro it literally is

/s
    Guess people ignore tone indicators :(
        redditors ignoring tone indicators moment
    Dw bro, the people got your message, honestly, I should've been the one to comment this, it is so true 🤣🤣🔥!
    You do know that diamond id the 3rd highest rank? And was the 2nd highest for around 2 years? Most people (65%?) are on bronze-gold tier, and for diamond, there are not that many players (5%?).

Dont misunderstand by watching twitch streamers.
        I was joking, hence the /s
            Mb, I thought you weren't joking because of the dislikes.
            doesn't /s stand for serious?
                no /srs is serious
        If you go by the average player, yes diamond is quite high. However, It is about middle of the pack if you want a non linear scale that can actually tell the difference between say lower immortal and higher immortal somewhat intuitively. In other words, if all nba players or F1 drivers are 10s, yes diamond is high quite high. But going from 9 to 10 doesn't feel enough of a difference when taking about say Jokic and an average Euroleague player or a bench warmer. Or say Ocon and Verstappen. That is why people use a non linear scale to tell the difference and in that sense diamond is not very high. 

And I highly doubt most people do it to see themselves as better, it is often because they have a lot of mistakes to iron to do to get to the top. But I have to admit some do it do belittle others, for sure. And they are jackasses. 

The second reason is average player, like the average person, or average student is quite bad at anything. I think anyone who worked a people facing job can agree with that. Idk about US system prior to higher education, but is 1150 considered a decently good SAT score? Though it is by definition above average. I genuinely don't know. All I know is that SATs aren't everything when it comes to admissions and that's quite good for relieving stress from people. I wish I had that back up back when I was prepping for exams, or rich/connected parents that get me in anyway. But I digress.

TLDR: Belittling people for rank is dumb regardless of them being above average or not. But there are valid reasons to use a non linear scale, like showing the difficulty of getting to a certain rank in a way that makes more sense.
            I get what you mean, but by measuring with averages, diamond is quite high.
                just bo point in doing that when u are talking about the skill of a player
            literally no one on earth would do this in a linear way. the reason people think diamond is low elo is dogshit youtubers and people like wooj who are like "oh wow youre diamond and made THIS mistake? time to retire buddy" when the player fat fingered a light shield instead of a full on a full buy
Well because it is compared to them. This happens on every game in every single rank. The rank below theirs is always 'low rank'. Although to be fair it does depend how much higher they are, maybe ascendants shouldn't be calling diamond low rank.
    and immortals are low rank to pro players, so? even among radiants there's noticable difference, and upper radiants definitely smack immos, so is radiant the only rank that isn't low now?
Diamond is mid elo, plat is low elo
This !
Lmao quite the opposite happens with me, I am a little higher rank than others and when I play swiftplay or unrated to chill, the other kids with tracker or something  start trashtalking me saying how boosted I am for my rank when they kill me or are winning the unrated
all of my lobbies are mixed with golds and plats and im pretty sure theres not much difference and some plats struggle to hit easy shots and some golds aim like they play deathmatch for hours everyday
    Yea ofcourse, but this was a full gold lobby and he was plat 2. I know there will always be a mix, the main issue was his ego and making the team feel like shit. It was unnecessary the unnecessary comments from him
        yeah thats the problem he is like one rank above yall and thinks he is like immortal
Esp solo queue is really bad this act
Really? I've gone from b1 to G1 with a flat 50/50 win rate this act
I went from gold 3 to diamond 1 with only +5 W/L so I don’t know what you mean
    "My experience isn't this, therefore it is WRONG" lmao
This is what I aspire to be.
    I mostly play with my friends and even they don't take it seriously. We're just chilling and having fun and laughing most of the time. One time one of my friends in ascent B site 1v1 situation playing sova randomly shot a shock dart into the site and started to move towards the site, when he was in the site the shock came bouncing from somewhere and fucking killed him. It was so freaking hilarious.
        It's definitely easier with friends. There are days my mental can't handle solo Q comp. My duo is two ranks above me so we can't comp. but we're pretty chill when we play.
Fr val prolly has top 3 ahittiest community of all games....
That's fair - I'm mainly wondering why people feel the need to comment hateful stuff on those clips
    A lot of criticism stems from the feeling of "I wanted this clip to be amazing" but yes if it's hateful or disrespectful to the player I don't agree with what they're saying.
why are u comparing geometry dash and valorant lmao.. i dont find playing an extreme demon for 25000 attempts amusing at all  and theres a lot of gd youtubers who post non demon or easy demons too 
    It’s just a game where completing a hard vs. easy achievement is objective rather than subjective. 

I don’t care what you find amusing that’s irrelevant to the conversation. 

Of course there are people who post those. But they aren’t posting it on the subreddit bragging about how good they are like a silver might do.
        its just cringe man, my 8 year old brother beats demons like its nothing do why bother mentioning a random rhythm game like gd or osu and making a sad analogy
            How is GD cringe? Clearly you do not understand my analogy so instead you choose to attack it.
But - for the silver elo OP who got an ace in a silver lobby - that was hard for them. That's the thing I think people don't understand. Unless OP is a literal smurf, then the clip wasn't something easy for them to do (and likely why they posted it)

Your comment is exactly what I'm talking about. An immortal will see the clip and say "huh??? That was so easy" - no shit for you it would be easy. It's like people forget there are different skill levels in this game
    I understand it was hard for them. This is exactly what my post is talking about.

The reality is something that is hard for a silver player to do is not generally impressive. 
Is it impressive for THEM? yes. 
For the average person on r/valorant? No. 
Am I saying they shouldn’t post it? No.

The main issue is when there is bragging or ego or just lack of self awareness.

Like when I see a notification and the title is “Insane 6k clutch” and the person proceeds to commit sins like insta crouch sprays into 3 people, it just gets annoying.
If they don't care then why leave those types of comments?
    Well that's simple, they're toxic and it's the internet.
I've seen plenty of comments that offer constructive criticism though. Those are really good. It's the people that feel the need to shit on the clip or ridicule OP for being low elo lmfao. If it makes you that mad, just keep scrolling?
Unless youre smurfing any ace is the enemy fucking up and not properly trading you.
    That's just not true. You can trade 4 of your teammates, or use utility to isolate the enemy.
        How often do those happen though and even then they fucked up by not using their util to isolate any of your teammates
            It's still better than an Odin ace through smokes or someone getting kills from people not looking at them. I'd rather not see every ace post littered with those kinds of aces. If luck was the only factor in an ace, it's not worth posting.
                Idk i think its fine. I care equally as little about all ace posts unless its in vct or a rare event like a penta raze rocket or brim ult or something
Maybe, but what is there to gain by pointing it out other than being a prick?
You're the type of person OP is talking about btw
    I don’t leave comments I get why you think I would tho lol, im just telling OP why some people do
        Well, you just left a comment, so
            Yeah Ik because OP was asking why people commenr if people leave a positive post I’m not gonna shit on them
                Well that's good
Yea bro this is why u solo queue and get no bitches
    Huh? Projection?
They could then offer constructive criticism or just keep scrolling. Feeling the need to comment hateful stuff is weird
    Posting things in a public forum but expecting only one opinion.

If you're so offended, just post to your Facebook so your mum can say good job, idk
Damn, so nobody below immortal can post clips?
    That's exactly what I said word for word.
Sure that makes sense - but my point was mostly that it didn't make sense to make hateful comments towards those clips. I think it's easier to just ignore them if they're not "impressive" enough. Or at least provide some constructive feedback
Nobody's is saying you need to comment "wow that's pretty impressive" on those posts lmao. Just move on if you didn't like it. No need to go into the comments to stroke your ego and put OP down
    Everyone wants their clips glazed, but ain't no one want their clips shit talked. Comments are for posting your thoughts. If someone wants to type "Yo, that shit was hot ass." Then let a brotha type that. If those other players don't want to be put down, they should practice more so that they aren't average. At the end of the day, they are just stupid internet comments, so who really gives a shit.
>Its okay if its inpressive for them, but then why post it

Is there a requirement on this sub that only immortal+ clips can be posted?
Username checks out
Why do you think this is? Firstly, in silver they are moving, not so great movement, but still. Secondly, if the people can't aim all that well, then even these less good movements are making it significantly  harder to shoot at someone. By logic, for a silver player (which is the highest low elo btw) it is the same hardships to endure and come out victorious. It is just as hard as a radianite getting an ace. Sure, the objective skill difference is high, but the subjective difficulty is the same. By your logic, any achievement below radiant shouldn't count as achievement, just bc there would be a lobby where it could not be done by the player bc he's not good enough.
    they're silvers because they're not good enough at the game. which means none of their achievements are worth anything. an ace is silver is worse than a triple kill in high elo.
        So in the instances you see these clips on your feed, do you feel the need to go into the comments and shit on the OP, or keep scrolling?
        So can I ask you what do you consider 'high elo'? Since you are referring to it in every comment, I feel like we should establish a common base for the continuation of this debate. For me low is iron to silver, mid is gold-plat and high is diamond and up.

Also, what are you referring to when you say they are not good enough. What are they not good enough for? To enjoy the game, to experience a false and fragile ego based on one thing that they're probably not gonna do for a living or to unwind and get better or what? Do you consider a graduation a worthy achievement? Getting a diploma? Two? Three? Making 6 figures? Being happy with your life, content with yourself? What would you say is your achievements?
            diamond is not high elo. if you have ever played in an actual dia3 lobby you'd know. they're no better than plat when it comes to game sense. the only thing dia players have on plat is more confidence. gold and below are low elo, plat to asc2 is mid elo, asc3 to immo 2 is high elo, and immo3 to radiant is the best players.

its a competitive shooter. if you wanna "enjoy" the game, then maybe play unrated? players are divided into ranked for a reason. the ones who do not know how to play are always at the BOTTOM and rightfully so. who says you need to earn something to show your achivements. the fact is low elo players are nothing, they're just warmup fodder for higher elo players. anyone below diamond should uninstall the game anyway since they'll never be better, and they should play some other game where skill floor is lower. 

why play a shooter if you cant aim? why play an competitive game if you don't have the brains to think strategy? low ranks are just a waste of server space. not everyone should be playing fps.
bro you're forgetting they're also silver, its good for them, for you not really but for them its impressive
> "Doesn't matter if the one shooting is low elo themselves"

Why doesn't it matter? Silver players arent easily one tapping. I feel like a lot of yall lack basic empathy.
The internet is like that, yes. That doesn't mean you have to support people like these by saying it's normal because "iTs tHe inTErnEt". Idk if you saying that means you want the internet to stay a toxic place or if youre just straight-up stupid, but the people in communities can at least try to make the community a non-toxic place, even if it doesnt mean that it will affect the whole internet.
No op is not saying to lie, op is saying don't be a fucking loser lmao.
    why exactly does saying what you actually think is a "fucking loser"
        If the sole purpose is tell a low elo player that they are low elo and you are better, you are a loser.
            how is telling them they are low elo from their silver elo ace mean "you are a loser"? 

you're talking as if telling them that they've only done it because its low elo is a bad statement when it isn't necessarily is.
                It’s an entirely pointless comment to make, they obviously know what elo they’re in and it serves as nothing more than a way for the person commenting it to stroke their own ego
                    it can also tell them that they wont get away with this when you get to higher elos.

you sound very insecured of yourself that you take the comment negatively when it shouldn't really be
                        No I think it’s just that you’re very condescending and don’t realize how insufferable you sound. If you genuinely think someone posting an ace doesn’t know they wouldn’t be able to do that against people better than them then you’re as dense as a rock
                        Well, the person posting it probably wasn’t asking for advice though?? Why do so many people not realise that scrolling away is also an option and making prick comments isn’t necessary?
                        I'm 100% sure any silver player knows that their ace wouldn't be possible in a high elo lobby. What would be the purpose of telling them that other than to stroke your own ego? 

You are EXACTLY the type of person I made this post for
Just because something isn't impressive to you doesn't mean you have to tell others. People aren't forcing anyone to comment on a silver clip, just let them enjoy their moment.
    its a discussion... lmao.

its basically asking the people on this subreddit "what do you think of this" unless the OP provided context at what they want, so why are you just going to scrolll when you actually think that this is unimpressive and is just low elo shit, when that's truly what you actually think?

if you don't want people to give negative inputs to you then don't make the post in the first place or tag it with "no negative inputs please" or something
        Unless the poster is specifically asking for your opinion in the title of a clip then no they're definitely not asking "what do you think of this", they're just sharing a moment they had. Weird take.
            its the opposite lol

there wouldn't even be a default comment section if what you're talking about i.e. just sharing hence not asking any input from the users of the sub is the default setup

pampered like a sheltered little princess take LOL
                Real weird take... I never understand why people feel the need to take time out of their day to bring other people down. Not cool at all
Or they could just ignore it and not comment.
    its a discussion... lmao.

        It's just a video game. You can let people be happy. 

It's very easy.
You are not obligated to post every single thing you think on the internet actually
or to just keep scrolling..? lmao

        Not how that works but alright
One way GOOD communities exist is connecting through shared experiences. If you see a clip you can just think back to when you were in that rank and how you would have felt rather than now when your better. Typically its something they're proud of because they did better than usual and its important to support them getting better and having fun.

  
or you can just be upset that not everyone is better than you when you see a clip, your choice.
Nobody that is actually secure in themselves feels the need to flex by putting down other people
Delusional
You disagreed and proved OPs point then said retracted initial statement and agreed. Majority of Valorants users are below diamond so clearly it really isn’t that easy..
One hour of aim training puts you in the top 8% of players? lol
    That was just an exaggeration tbh.
I do believe though that if people actually put effort into improving, people can easily reach mid-elo.
Top 8% may sound impressive, but that's mainly because probably half of the playerbase doesn't really focus on improving due to real life circumstances or they're not as invested into.
You've got people queuing over and over again without thinking about what they could improve in.
And the pros probably think all the immortals and radiants look like monkeys too. Most of them don't feel the need to stroke their ego online though
    I'm not stroking my ego though, im below immortal as well.
Even in Dia-Asc elo, there's a lot of people who acts like they're lost (including me).
There's rarely a strategy played in Ascendant soloq, it's turned into just a game of who spots each other quicker and shoots the head quicker.
        Doesn't matter what you say there is no reason to go spreading negativity on peoples posts when they're excited about something
            Yeah, that was clearly in my initial comment.
If you manage to kill 5 people within your skill level, that's impressive!
I'm just disagreeing with OP's other point.
Just out of curiosity, what rank are you and how many hours do you have?
    Surely he wouldn't say something like that without being immortal and not a lot of hours right.. right?
        This comment would be worse if i was an immortal, as that would mean im just calling people below me as monkeys, but no. im not immortal.

I'm just being honest as someone within mid-elo. everyone (including me) has so many mistakes that we may as well just be called monkeys.

Again, im not hating on people posting clips, those are cool and impressive since they did those within their skill level, i'm just pointing out that everyone below immortal is actually like monkeys.
            Delusional, again.
    I'm not immortal, so this doesn't count as stroking my ego.  
I'm just being honest and realistic.
        Yeah lmao, completely agree with people in lower ranks (me) playing weirdly. I was just wondering if you are diamond or ascendant and how many hours you have because with a claim like that I would expect you would have reached ascendant in maybe a couple of days.
im asc 3 and i can confirm im a instalock reyna legshot larry no comms chunky monkey
100% it’s full of absolute weirdos
    Meowing, barking, getting mad if you ask for util, racists, sexists and all sorts. The last two are less common than in CS, but there's definitely more weirdos in Val that aren't just pieces of crap lmao
        Its FPS without the real-sim crowd to keep them checked. Sometimes it's a good thing (more relaxed), sometimes it's not (more immature).
        I had a viper on lotus in ranked who would only play on C, when the enemies kept rushing A and B, and used their wall solely to cover main and waterfall. I asked nicely if they could possibly play B and use their wall across b main and A to delay their pushes. Asked, didn't say, and said please... They proceeded to never place their wall even for retake for the rest of defence - Lovely!!!
            You were probably playing with Crip Mac.
                The Custers didn’t keep it 55th by pushing A & B instead of C
            Well if viper held c on her own and you guys couldnt hold a or b together then its clearly a skill issue
                Viper was on C every round when they never attacked C, so I asked if they could do walls that cross A-B or B-C since they were our only smokes. Meant only C was ever covered with smokes, and on 3 site maps the viper wall becomes OP when you can cover two out of three sites. 

As I said, they proceeded to stop using the wall at all when I asked them to switch it up so they weren't holding shit. Plus, as I said, the enemy pretty much only pushed A/B and when they did push C viper died before we could rotate. Stopping all util use when asked to do something different is not an appropriate reaction in a team based game, and playing from the same location with the same util setup is not a good thing in Val. 

We could hold site to a point, but the wall stops hard rushes way easier than anything else especially on an already attacker sided map like Lotus. This was like, 3 months ago though and bronze lobbies so it's not like anyone is skilled at those ranks lol.
        Got lucky last night in a ranked match and had the other team ff after 5 rounds, 2 of my teammates were a weird e-couple and another guy was doing weird “what the sigma” voices the entire game.
Have you seen league? 5 seconds into the game and someone’s fragile ego will explode
Interesting, I feel like every competitive game there are plenty of people with egos and elitism. Same goes for things other than games as well
Ah a man of culture
Idk man… Dota is  pretty bad
I mean, ego is bound to be a big part of any competitive game. If you develop a system that ranks players accordingly to their skill, and clearly differentiate players of different skills with shiny rank icons, it gives players of a higher skill level a reason to feel superior to other players, and even make it part of their personality in some cases.
Are u saying that hes smurfing? I thought hes just playing unranked
    I believe he keeps his unranked MMR ungodly low on his account, his videos are funny but also I feel bad for those players. It must be annoying to get absolutely toyed with them instantly 1 tapped because you're that much worse.
        yea hes came out and said it before, he plays swift plays and unranked games to get his clips
    No he ain't
You talking about the bathtubboba guy?
I mean they can be proud of something without thinking theyre the best player in the world or deserve to be a significantly higher rank. Do you tell people at the gym they shouldn't be proud for benching 1 plate because other people can bench 2? And do you then tell those people they shouldn't be proud of benching 2 plates cos other people can bench 3?
    Those are 2 different things.
If one of my teammates in soloq get an ace, i'm cheering.
If a stranger post an ace, I don't fucking care.
If someone at the gym bench 1 plate I mind my business.
If my bro bench 1 plate and never benched before, I'm cheering.
oh boo hoo this kid 50 ranks lower than me got 5 kills in one round i cannot let that slide how dare he feel accomplished and enjoy the game normally
Thank you so much for being exhibit A
you sound so weird rn bro, some people just wanna share clips, why do you feel the need to put them down
    I don't. I don't care, I said "people". I'm not people.
Nah that's a bad take, there's a difference between being proud of something and wanting to show people and doing it because of ego or to inflate your ego
because val is a lot of people’s first FPS. it takes a while to adjust.
    It's not that I don't understand that, I just don't understand anything below iron 3 at the least, valorant was my absolute first game on pc except like cool math or something and I started at bronze 1 and never dropped to iron, I actually played with some iron friends and the shenanigans I witnessed... idek how to describe. I honestly started to admire them lmao, to be so bad at a game yet still somehow enjoy it and have fun is something I'd just never be able to do, I'd have to quit if I was that bad and incapable of growth
        yeah it’s not that deep for most people. but again. a lot of people started gaming in covid with ZERO gaming experience. console or pc.
            Fair enough ig
        I think it's also a lot of people playing on either horrible gaming setups or horrible ping (or both), which explains why it looks so weird.
            That's what I thought too but after fixing my friends setup and internet there was still no improvement lol, and im sure for many that is the case
I got stuck in Iron 3 for like 2 act.  Valorant was like the very first competitive shooter for me, so I need to learn a lot of stuff at that time. No offense, but based on me being in the same rank, all I know that a lot of Iron don't really have the most basic gamesense (crosshair placement, footstep, angle, etc.) Which is why this rank exist. Eventually, I got out of there and able to reach Plat 2 this act after 2 years. (I didn't play much lol)
    Yea, I think a lot of them literally look at the ground as they walk....
No they wont.  Most of these kids you speak of are grown ass adults that act like children.
i've lost rounds because of this, now i will always repeat 'i dont want the ace, kill him if you see him' to my team if i get 4. my (likely mediocre) clip is not worth losing elo over lol
Correct, I do this too. Like I said I dont even want the ace unless its natural, just feels so wrong to me personally. Winning the round with the least amount of casualties > unnatural ace. Its the difference between winning and losing games. Too many players underestimate how much a good economy is needed.
    Precisely my point. Yeah you get the clip but at what cost - 3 rifles? So now your team has to eco the next round
    Just tell them to hide or back up and you go look for them
        No. Thats also unnatural and dumb.
Guess people ignore tone indicators :(
    redditors ignoring tone indicators moment
Dw bro, the people got your message, honestly, I should've been the one to comment this, it is so true 🤣🤣🔥!
You do know that diamond id the 3rd highest rank? And was the 2nd highest for around 2 years? Most people (65%?) are on bronze-gold tier, and for diamond, there are not that many players (5%?).

Dont misunderstand by watching twitch streamers.
    I was joking, hence the /s
        Mb, I thought you weren't joking because of the dislikes.
        doesn't /s stand for serious?
            no /srs is serious
    If you go by the average player, yes diamond is quite high. However, It is about middle of the pack if you want a non linear scale that can actually tell the difference between say lower immortal and higher immortal somewhat intuitively. In other words, if all nba players or F1 drivers are 10s, yes diamond is high quite high. But going from 9 to 10 doesn't feel enough of a difference when taking about say Jokic and an average Euroleague player or a bench warmer. Or say Ocon and Verstappen. That is why people use a non linear scale to tell the difference and in that sense diamond is not very high. 

And I highly doubt most people do it to see themselves as better, it is often because they have a lot of mistakes to iron to do to get to the top. But I have to admit some do it do belittle others, for sure. And they are jackasses. 

The second reason is average player, like the average person, or average student is quite bad at anything. I think anyone who worked a people facing job can agree with that. Idk about US system prior to higher education, but is 1150 considered a decently good SAT score? Though it is by definition above average. I genuinely don't know. All I know is that SATs aren't everything when it comes to admissions and that's quite good for relieving stress from people. I wish I had that back up back when I was prepping for exams, or rich/connected parents that get me in anyway. But I digress.

TLDR: Belittling people for rank is dumb regardless of them being above average or not. But there are valid reasons to use a non linear scale, like showing the difficulty of getting to a certain rank in a way that makes more sense.
        I get what you mean, but by measuring with averages, diamond is quite high.
            just bo point in doing that when u are talking about the skill of a player
        literally no one on earth would do this in a linear way. the reason people think diamond is low elo is dogshit youtubers and people like wooj who are like "oh wow youre diamond and made THIS mistake? time to retire buddy" when the player fat fingered a light shield instead of a full on a full buy
and immortals are low rank to pro players, so? even among radiants there's noticable difference, and upper radiants definitely smack immos, so is radiant the only rank that isn't low now?
Yea ofcourse, but this was a full gold lobby and he was plat 2. I know there will always be a mix, the main issue was his ego and making the team feel like shit. It was unnecessary the unnecessary comments from him
    yeah thats the problem he is like one rank above yall and thinks he is like immortal
"My experience isn't this, therefore it is WRONG" lmao
I mostly play with my friends and even they don't take it seriously. We're just chilling and having fun and laughing most of the time. One time one of my friends in ascent B site 1v1 situation playing sova randomly shot a shock dart into the site and started to move towards the site, when he was in the site the shock came bouncing from somewhere and fucking killed him. It was so freaking hilarious.
    It's definitely easier with friends. There are days my mental can't handle solo Q comp. My duo is two ranks above me so we can't comp. but we're pretty chill when we play.
A lot of criticism stems from the feeling of "I wanted this clip to be amazing" but yes if it's hateful or disrespectful to the player I don't agree with what they're saying.
It’s just a game where completing a hard vs. easy achievement is objective rather than subjective. 

I don’t care what you find amusing that’s irrelevant to the conversation. 

Of course there are people who post those. But they aren’t posting it on the subreddit bragging about how good they are like a silver might do.
    its just cringe man, my 8 year old brother beats demons like its nothing do why bother mentioning a random rhythm game like gd or osu and making a sad analogy
        How is GD cringe? Clearly you do not understand my analogy so instead you choose to attack it.
I understand it was hard for them. This is exactly what my post is talking about.

The reality is something that is hard for a silver player to do is not generally impressive. 
Is it impressive for THEM? yes. 
For the average person on r/valorant? No. 
Am I saying they shouldn’t post it? No.

The main issue is when there is bragging or ego or just lack of self awareness.

Like when I see a notification and the title is “Insane 6k clutch” and the person proceeds to commit sins like insta crouch sprays into 3 people, it just gets annoying.
Well that's simple, they're toxic and it's the internet.
That's just not true. You can trade 4 of your teammates, or use utility to isolate the enemy.
    How often do those happen though and even then they fucked up by not using their util to isolate any of your teammates
        It's still better than an Odin ace through smokes or someone getting kills from people not looking at them. I'd rather not see every ace post littered with those kinds of aces. If luck was the only factor in an ace, it's not worth posting.
            Idk i think its fine. I care equally as little about all ace posts unless its in vct or a rare event like a penta raze rocket or brim ult or something
I don’t leave comments I get why you think I would tho lol, im just telling OP why some people do
    Well, you just left a comment, so
        Yeah Ik because OP was asking why people commenr if people leave a positive post I’m not gonna shit on them
            Well that's good
Huh? Projection?
Posting things in a public forum but expecting only one opinion.

If you're so offended, just post to your Facebook so your mum can say good job, idk
That's exactly what I said word for word.
Everyone wants their clips glazed, but ain't no one want their clips shit talked. Comments are for posting your thoughts. If someone wants to type "Yo, that shit was hot ass." Then let a brotha type that. If those other players don't want to be put down, they should practice more so that they aren't average. At the end of the day, they are just stupid internet comments, so who really gives a shit.
they're silvers because they're not good enough at the game. which means none of their achievements are worth anything. an ace is silver is worse than a triple kill in high elo.
    So in the instances you see these clips on your feed, do you feel the need to go into the comments and shit on the OP, or keep scrolling?
    So can I ask you what do you consider 'high elo'? Since you are referring to it in every comment, I feel like we should establish a common base for the continuation of this debate. For me low is iron to silver, mid is gold-plat and high is diamond and up.

Also, what are you referring to when you say they are not good enough. What are they not good enough for? To enjoy the game, to experience a false and fragile ego based on one thing that they're probably not gonna do for a living or to unwind and get better or what? Do you consider a graduation a worthy achievement? Getting a diploma? Two? Three? Making 6 figures? Being happy with your life, content with yourself? What would you say is your achievements?
        diamond is not high elo. if you have ever played in an actual dia3 lobby you'd know. they're no better than plat when it comes to game sense. the only thing dia players have on plat is more confidence. gold and below are low elo, plat to asc2 is mid elo, asc3 to immo 2 is high elo, and immo3 to radiant is the best players.

its a competitive shooter. if you wanna "enjoy" the game, then maybe play unrated? players are divided into ranked for a reason. the ones who do not know how to play are always at the BOTTOM and rightfully so. who says you need to earn something to show your achivements. the fact is low elo players are nothing, they're just warmup fodder for higher elo players. anyone below diamond should uninstall the game anyway since they'll never be better, and they should play some other game where skill floor is lower. 

why play a shooter if you cant aim? why play an competitive game if you don't have the brains to think strategy? low ranks are just a waste of server space. not everyone should be playing fps.
why exactly does saying what you actually think is a "fucking loser"
    If the sole purpose is tell a low elo player that they are low elo and you are better, you are a loser.
        how is telling them they are low elo from their silver elo ace mean "you are a loser"? 

you're talking as if telling them that they've only done it because its low elo is a bad statement when it isn't necessarily is.
            It’s an entirely pointless comment to make, they obviously know what elo they’re in and it serves as nothing more than a way for the person commenting it to stroke their own ego
                it can also tell them that they wont get away with this when you get to higher elos.

you sound very insecured of yourself that you take the comment negatively when it shouldn't really be
                    No I think it’s just that you’re very condescending and don’t realize how insufferable you sound. If you genuinely think someone posting an ace doesn’t know they wouldn’t be able to do that against people better than them then you’re as dense as a rock
                    Well, the person posting it probably wasn’t asking for advice though?? Why do so many people not realise that scrolling away is also an option and making prick comments isn’t necessary?
                    I'm 100% sure any silver player knows that their ace wouldn't be possible in a high elo lobby. What would be the purpose of telling them that other than to stroke your own ego? 

You are EXACTLY the type of person I made this post for
its a discussion... lmao.

its basically asking the people on this subreddit "what do you think of this" unless the OP provided context at what they want, so why are you just going to scrolll when you actually think that this is unimpressive and is just low elo shit, when that's truly what you actually think?

if you don't want people to give negative inputs to you then don't make the post in the first place or tag it with "no negative inputs please" or something
    Unless the poster is specifically asking for your opinion in the title of a clip then no they're definitely not asking "what do you think of this", they're just sharing a moment they had. Weird take.
        its the opposite lol

there wouldn't even be a default comment section if what you're talking about i.e. just sharing hence not asking any input from the users of the sub is the default setup

pampered like a sheltered little princess take LOL
            Real weird take... I never understand why people feel the need to take time out of their day to bring other people down. Not cool at all
its a discussion... lmao.

    It's just a video game. You can let people be happy. 

It's very easy.

    Not how that works but alright
That was just an exaggeration tbh.
I do believe though that if people actually put effort into improving, people can easily reach mid-elo.
Top 8% may sound impressive, but that's mainly because probably half of the playerbase doesn't really focus on improving due to real life circumstances or they're not as invested into.
You've got people queuing over and over again without thinking about what they could improve in.
I'm not stroking my ego though, im below immortal as well.
Even in Dia-Asc elo, there's a lot of people who acts like they're lost (including me).
There's rarely a strategy played in Ascendant soloq, it's turned into just a game of who spots each other quicker and shoots the head quicker.
    Doesn't matter what you say there is no reason to go spreading negativity on peoples posts when they're excited about something
        Yeah, that was clearly in my initial comment.
If you manage to kill 5 people within your skill level, that's impressive!
I'm just disagreeing with OP's other point.
Surely he wouldn't say something like that without being immortal and not a lot of hours right.. right?
    This comment would be worse if i was an immortal, as that would mean im just calling people below me as monkeys, but no. im not immortal.

I'm just being honest as someone within mid-elo. everyone (including me) has so many mistakes that we may as well just be called monkeys.

Again, im not hating on people posting clips, those are cool and impressive since they did those within their skill level, i'm just pointing out that everyone below immortal is actually like monkeys.
        Delusional, again.
I'm not immortal, so this doesn't count as stroking my ego.  
I'm just being honest and realistic.
    Yeah lmao, completely agree with people in lower ranks (me) playing weirdly. I was just wondering if you are diamond or ascendant and how many hours you have because with a claim like that I would expect you would have reached ascendant in maybe a couple of days.
Meowing, barking, getting mad if you ask for util, racists, sexists and all sorts. The last two are less common than in CS, but there's definitely more weirdos in Val that aren't just pieces of crap lmao
    Its FPS without the real-sim crowd to keep them checked. Sometimes it's a good thing (more relaxed), sometimes it's not (more immature).
    I had a viper on lotus in ranked who would only play on C, when the enemies kept rushing A and B, and used their wall solely to cover main and waterfall. I asked nicely if they could possibly play B and use their wall across b main and A to delay their pushes. Asked, didn't say, and said please... They proceeded to never place their wall even for retake for the rest of defence - Lovely!!!
        You were probably playing with Crip Mac.
            The Custers didn’t keep it 55th by pushing A & B instead of C
        Well if viper held c on her own and you guys couldnt hold a or b together then its clearly a skill issue
            Viper was on C every round when they never attacked C, so I asked if they could do walls that cross A-B or B-C since they were our only smokes. Meant only C was ever covered with smokes, and on 3 site maps the viper wall becomes OP when you can cover two out of three sites. 

As I said, they proceeded to stop using the wall at all when I asked them to switch it up so they weren't holding shit. Plus, as I said, the enemy pretty much only pushed A/B and when they did push C viper died before we could rotate. Stopping all util use when asked to do something different is not an appropriate reaction in a team based game, and playing from the same location with the same util setup is not a good thing in Val. 

We could hold site to a point, but the wall stops hard rushes way easier than anything else especially on an already attacker sided map like Lotus. This was like, 3 months ago though and bronze lobbies so it's not like anyone is skilled at those ranks lol.
    Got lucky last night in a ranked match and had the other team ff after 5 rounds, 2 of my teammates were a weird e-couple and another guy was doing weird “what the sigma” voices the entire game.
I believe he keeps his unranked MMR ungodly low on his account, his videos are funny but also I feel bad for those players. It must be annoying to get absolutely toyed with them instantly 1 tapped because you're that much worse.
    yea hes came out and said it before, he plays swift plays and unranked games to get his clips
No he ain't
Those are 2 different things.
If one of my teammates in soloq get an ace, i'm cheering.
If a stranger post an ace, I don't fucking care.
If someone at the gym bench 1 plate I mind my business.
If my bro bench 1 plate and never benched before, I'm cheering.
I don't. I don't care, I said "people". I'm not people.
It's not that I don't understand that, I just don't understand anything below iron 3 at the least, valorant was my absolute first game on pc except like cool math or something and I started at bronze 1 and never dropped to iron, I actually played with some iron friends and the shenanigans I witnessed... idek how to describe. I honestly started to admire them lmao, to be so bad at a game yet still somehow enjoy it and have fun is something I'd just never be able to do, I'd have to quit if I was that bad and incapable of growth
    yeah it’s not that deep for most people. but again. a lot of people started gaming in covid with ZERO gaming experience. console or pc.
        Fair enough ig
    I think it's also a lot of people playing on either horrible gaming setups or horrible ping (or both), which explains why it looks so weird.
        That's what I thought too but after fixing my friends setup and internet there was still no improvement lol, and im sure for many that is the case
Yea, I think a lot of them literally look at the ground as they walk....
Precisely my point. Yeah you get the clip but at what cost - 3 rifles? So now your team has to eco the next round
Just tell them to hide or back up and you go look for them
    No. Thats also unnatural and dumb.
redditors ignoring tone indicators moment
I was joking, hence the /s
    Mb, I thought you weren't joking because of the dislikes.
    doesn't /s stand for serious?
        no /srs is serious
If you go by the average player, yes diamond is quite high. However, It is about middle of the pack if you want a non linear scale that can actually tell the difference between say lower immortal and higher immortal somewhat intuitively. In other words, if all nba players or F1 drivers are 10s, yes diamond is high quite high. But going from 9 to 10 doesn't feel enough of a difference when taking about say Jokic and an average Euroleague player or a bench warmer. Or say Ocon and Verstappen. That is why people use a non linear scale to tell the difference and in that sense diamond is not very high. 

And I highly doubt most people do it to see themselves as better, it is often because they have a lot of mistakes to iron to do to get to the top. But I have to admit some do it do belittle others, for sure. And they are jackasses. 

The second reason is average player, like the average person, or average student is quite bad at anything. I think anyone who worked a people facing job can agree with that. Idk about US system prior to higher education, but is 1150 considered a decently good SAT score? Though it is by definition above average. I genuinely don't know. All I know is that SATs aren't everything when it comes to admissions and that's quite good for relieving stress from people. I wish I had that back up back when I was prepping for exams, or rich/connected parents that get me in anyway. But I digress.

TLDR: Belittling people for rank is dumb regardless of them being above average or not. But there are valid reasons to use a non linear scale, like showing the difficulty of getting to a certain rank in a way that makes more sense.
    I get what you mean, but by measuring with averages, diamond is quite high.
        just bo point in doing that when u are talking about the skill of a player
    literally no one on earth would do this in a linear way. the reason people think diamond is low elo is dogshit youtubers and people like wooj who are like "oh wow youre diamond and made THIS mistake? time to retire buddy" when the player fat fingered a light shield instead of a full on a full buy
yeah thats the problem he is like one rank above yall and thinks he is like immortal
It's definitely easier with friends. There are days my mental can't handle solo Q comp. My duo is two ranks above me so we can't comp. but we're pretty chill when we play.
its just cringe man, my 8 year old brother beats demons like its nothing do why bother mentioning a random rhythm game like gd or osu and making a sad analogy
    How is GD cringe? Clearly you do not understand my analogy so instead you choose to attack it.

Stopping all util use when asked to do something different is not an appropriate reaction in a team based game, and playing from the same location with the same util setup is not a good thing in Val. 

We could hold site to a point, but the wall stops hard rushes way easier than anything else especially on an already attacker sided map like Lotus. This was like, 3 months ago though and bronze lobbies so it's not like anyone is skilled at those ranks lol.
Fair enough ig
That's what I thought too but after fixing my friends setup and internet there was still no improvement lol, and im sure for many that is the case
no /srs is serious
just bo point in doing that when u are talking about the skill of a player
Idk i think its fine. I care equally as little about all ace posts unless its in vct or a rare event like a penta raze rocket or brim ult or something
Well that's good
It’s an entirely pointless comment to make, they obviously know what elo they’re in and it serves as nothing more than a way for the person commenting it to stroke their own ego
    it can also tell them that they wont get away with this when you get to higher elos.

you sound very insecured of yourself that you take the comment negatively when it shouldn't really be
        No I think it’s just that you’re very condescending and don’t realize how insufferable you sound. If you genuinely think someone posting an ace doesn’t know they wouldn’t be able to do that against people better than them then you’re as dense as a rock
        Well, the person posting it probably wasn’t asking for advice though?? Why do so many people not realise that scrolling away is also an option and making prick comments isn’t necessary?
        I'm 100% sure any silver player knows that their ace wouldn't be possible in a high elo lobby. What would be the purpose of telling them that other than to stroke your own ego? 

You are EXACTLY the type of person I made this post for
Real weird take... I never understand why people feel the need to take time out of their day to bring other people down. Not cool at all
The Custers didn’t keep it 55th by pushing A & B instead of C
Viper was on C every round when they never attacked C, so I asked if they could do walls that cross A-B or B-C since they were our only smokes. Meant only C was ever covered with smokes, and on 3 site maps the viper wall becomes OP when you can cover two out of three sites.
