[[What are your agent picks for every class of agents]]


So guys, I've decided that in order for me to rank up, I have to make my agent pool small and not jumping around like 10 agents. So I've decided that I'll pick 1 agent from each class and fill my team composition for more effectiveness. So what would you guys pick as your mains from each class?


KJ sentinel 
Viper / omen smokes 
Skye initiator 
Iso / raze duellist 

Iso can be flexed as a part initiator, viper can work as a sentinel as well.
    Same. Although I'd prefer Brim instead of Viper. She is only good on some maps (Breeze)
        Viper is good on *almost* every map, specifically effective on Breeze, Icebox, Split, Fracture, Bind and Pearl. The rest are alright with the exceptions of Haven and Ascent, where I personally hate having a Viper.

I just don't think she's as effective as it could be and any smokes (Astra specifically) does the job better. Haven because it's too big and Ascent mainly because it's a very flexible map where I prefer having a more flexible smoker like Brim, Astra or Omen
        try viper on split, ascent, sunset, bind, haven and lotus. She's the goat on every map but breeze (unless u have seconds smokes). She can solo all these maps except for like bind unless you have a lineup for her orb from b to a to land in short.
        So is brim tbh
            Brim is good on most maps besides breeze
                As a brim main Im dreading the Pearl and Icebox comeback :(
                I play Brim on Breeze and won like 80% of them
                    Ok but viper is just better on breeze
                        I agree. Harbor as well.
                    I'm assuming you're not a high rank then
                    Brim main 70%.. harbor for breeze for sure
        Viper is not a good solo controller for ranked and with this in mind, she's good on quite a few more maps, if not all of them. It's just tricky playing viper as a secondary on ranked.
KJ/cypher jett/raze astra/brim/(viper breeze)/ skye/sova
    This guy knows what's good
My playstyle typically had me having previously learnt lineups etc.

Duelist: yoru (only really play duelist for fun, flash lineups can be very powerful)

Sentinel: cypher (my primary agent, can still provide good value and kill potential on bad games)

Initiator: kayo (not exactly an initiator player either)

Controller: viper (having some ratty setups for most maps can secure 1-2 rounds pretty consistently)
    i think we share the same brain
        I think we share the same brain x2
    same here but astra instead of viper as of rn
i'd go with cypher as sentinel, brimstone for smokes, reyna or phoenix for duellist, and sova as initiator. that's my go-to setup for climbing the ranks!
    legit so easy to climb with brim and sova
If you really want to improve please just play 1 agent only, 2 max just in case they get taken. Filling for team comp will hold you back in low elo.
    I disagree with this. I had experience with every agent by the time I hit diamond. I think it’s good to play everyone and see how they work. It will only make you a better player against them. Now I’m ascendant almost immortal and I switch between 4-5 agents.
        Of course you still need to know how the agents work. But the floor is infinitely easier to achieve, just spend some time in range or custom and watch pro vods, no need to spend 100 hours playing them yourself. And trust me, people are not as good at their agent as they think. There are countless diamond/ascendant skyes that fail their fucking flash half the time for example. At least you're in ascendant, god forbid some silver thinks they can fill an agent.
        Yeah. Especially with the playerbase and their egos. I get the most wins when I fill.
    I predominantly play Initiators and have been trying to squeeze in most of my matches as Skye. And I like playing Brim and Viper too. So should I only play these agents? (Skye mainly and Brim as priority for smokes)
        Ideally two of the same agents from the same class but yes, try to stick with 2. Reason being that every class has designated "tasks" within the team and learning what you're supposed to be doing is something people up to immortal (and even a fair number of Immortals) struggle at.


With Skye/ initiators, you need to learn where flash zones are, how to gather good intel, and how to coordinate with your duelist to support their entry.


With Brim/controllers, you need to have a good read on the map to smoke the correct places on time, understand how different smoke setups will affect how enemies play, and learn what advantages/disadvantages each smoke location has as you could be actively hurting your team with bad smokes.


Because of these differences, you'll have different priorities (who watches flank, what order you enter site, who dodges the defending flashes on entry, etc) so it can be difficult to learn to play two different class to the same effectiveness. You'll likely get better, faster by sticking to one class.
        Just instalock. It really does not matter and people who flame you really have no reason to. Filling really doesn't help when you don't know the ins and outs of an agent.  

Playing an agent you know is always better than just filling in a role you're not great at.
    what is low elo? below dia/asc? i’m playing jett astra deadlock atm but 2 of them are mainly filling
        Wouldn't play more than 2 below asc
    seriously, this. was filling nearly every game for a month and was hardstuck plat 1. played Iso for a week consistently and not only has my aim gotten much better but I'm already plat 3 50 rr. consistency is key to rank up
It's not really efficient to main agents in Val as much as it is to main a role. That's because different maps have different agents that are good on them from the same role, whereas all roles are required on every map. 

The other reason is that each role has a certain playstyle and having to drastically change playstyles game to game leads to inconsistency. E.g. as a sentinel, your jobs are to care for flank, lurk and disrupt enemy rotations, so you'll usually be away from your team. Compare this to an initiator, who's usually 2nd or 3rd man in and generally plays with the pack to set their duelist up.

So I'd say pick a role and decide on 1 agent from that role for each map.
    I predominantly play Initiators because I like them so much as I can play support role for my team. In fact the first player that I played with in the tutorial top was Sova. But I saw some videos and people talking about filling is good and pick one agent for each class. So should I keep on playing just Initiators? I play smokes too sometimes when I wanna have fun.
        Pick 2 agent per role that you’re ok-ish at, just incase you HAVE to fill. Dont really practice them, just make sure you have one you’re not useless on if you really have to.

Pick a main role and get comfortable on it, then pick a secondary role and get somewhat comfortable on it. 80% of games you Probably get role 1, 15% role 2 and 5% fill
        I don't think there's a single map that you absolutely shouldn't play skye on
        If Initiator is fun to you, stick to them, yeah. Something to keep in mind though is that the way you play Initiators with a flash (flash intiators) and ones without (recon initiators) is very different, so I'd suggest keeping to one or the other.
    This is the way OP. The way our game sense develops would be different per role and so as Boza said its hard to switch around different mindsets in an effective way. 

So far the only good advice I've seen in ur post's comment section
Duelist: Reyna. Ok listen, I know this community hates reyna for some reason, but she is the single character who has carry potential in this game. (Purely because she can heal to 150).

Initiator: Skye. She is vital for info if you're playing with friends or like to communicate while playing the game.

Controller: Viper(Breeze/ Split) Brim otherwise. Brim's stim is too good, so much so I feel it's underrated.

Sentinel: Cypher. Infinite flank check range and after the current buff (his trips), he is very hard to play against, and offers so much more value than other sentinels in the game.
    Thanks man, I'll start grinding on those agents and also improving my comms
Duelist: jett/raze

Ini : sova/skye

Smokes: viper/omen

Sen : KJ
cypher, jett, skye, viper
duelist: cypher  
smokes: cypher  
initiator: cypher  
sentinel: kj
    Damnnn, you took away Cypher from his original class and put him everywhere else 😂😂. Care to explain?
    This actually works if you have inferior opponents. The camera works as a flash(distractor), the cages are smokes and both combined, you become an initiator. 

And if you are carrying, you are not going to play defensively anyways so not a sentinel. This comment makes total sense.
    This is the way
While this logic makes sense on paper, practically it’s not a great idea. Let’s say your strongest on Omen as smokes, so you always fill Omen when your team needs smokes. While that might useful on split or bind, other maps such as breeze or Pearl are better suited to other smokes agents like viper and harbour. 

Same goes for other roles. Sova has really impactful utility on Ascent and Bind but he lacks use on Split. 

Like others have said it’s good to stick to 2-3 agents that you can master and try to only play them on maps where they’re competitive picks.
ok I swear I'm not joking but mine are:

Sentinel: Deadlock
Duelist: Yoru
Controler: Harbor
Initiator: Gekko

I only play the forgotten ones lol
    Idk about DL and Harbor (because I haven't even unlocked them) , but I kinda like Yoru and Gekko, so I can feel you
I'm low elo so take this with a grain of salt, 
A lot of people would say play Reyna and Jett but I honestly enjoy playing yoru as a duelist. Yes I get that he's a risky agent but I think that's the fun of him.
For an initiator I love playing breach. The combination of screw this location you can't see or shoot straight and versatility are hilarious.
For controller I usually play omen as an aggressive controller that can reposition easily and his ultimate ability to grab spike from a different site are great for 1v3 clutches
I've recently become a brimstone main though practicing lineups and smoke positioning and it has been carrying my ranked games.
I don't play sentinel enough to recommend a main but I know chamber is fun though he's nerfed to absolute shit, but killjoy though not my choice is the meta right now
This is a really good question which is rare for this sub.

Mine are: Sage (sentinel is my main role so i can play any but most maps sage), Jett, Omen, and Fade.
I don't play all roles, I focus on only two agents all the time. Getting really good to play an agent takes hundreds of hours of plays imo to really use their ability really good almost without thinking, complementing your aim.

I always play Phoenix, not mobile but very good flashes, self heal and his ultimate puts lot of pressure when used right with only 6 points to get.

Usually if I see two duelist instalock I'll pick my second one: Gekko. Very versatile, extremely good in offense to plant safely. His E is insane to check if there's an enemy, also blinds which is cool, and can be used again. Ult is hard to land but basically one or two free kills if you do. Love this guy.

Though I'd say I don't like playing Gekko on Haven and Breeze for example, so sorry but on those maps I'll almost always go for the instalock Phoenix :( I'm always thinking what's the best conditions to get the win for me and my teammates. Never gonna play a champ I don't feel confident in competitive.

If reallllyy I have no choice and need to play smoke, I'll go Omen/Harbor but I'm not very good with them as I don't practice. It happens like once every 50 games. Usually I can always take Phoenix or Gekko without issue. As for Sentinel, I don't have any I can play at a decent level, I'd rather pick double initiator instead for my team (so Gekko pick)
It's much better to pick within one role than one agent per role. This way things like the position in the pack will come more naturally, for example a duelist usually goes first but a sentinel might lurk on the other side of the map. 

I would say try to specialize in one role (initiators are split in two, flash and recon)
    Hmm that's actually a good point. I mainly play Initiators and recently unlocked Skye as she is meta rn. So I guess I'll start grinding her that way I can play as both flash and recon agent
KJ and Cypher for sentinels (it's very map specific imo for which of the two you want to use)

Omen or viper(again map specific) and secondary as harbor for double controller

Jett is S ranked if you have the aim same with reyna otherwise good go to duelists are yoru and phoenix(the partners in crime or brothers in arms as I like to call them)
Phoenix is just that good does everything for himself and  yoru well you don't aim with yoru if you have the game sense

as for initiators I got no fucking clue but personally I prefer sova or kayo but all iniators are best on almost any map..tho there are always map specifics like sova on ascent that are more standard fps and skye on maps like split and sunset with a lot of corners and low travel time and breach for fracture in particular kayo works on any map imo

These are for solo queue but a more brief list would be
sentinels: KJ cypher
controller: omen viper
duelists: yoru phoenix
initiators: sova and skye/kayo(a flash agent)
Well shrinking your pool is overall a good idea.  
But instead of learning one agent of each role, you should just main one role and play most agents of that role.  
Why is that? Well if you main Flashes, you know what are good places to play as a flash agent and you can identify when to flash for teammates and what is generally good things to do as a flash initiator, due to experience on the role. If you were to main one agent of each class, it will be a lot harder, simply because you can‘t apply knowledge about Recon Initiators onto Sentinels etc…   
For example if you‘d choose controller i‘d recommend: Omen, Brim, Viper ( Harbor if someone also picks smokes )
Sentinel: Usually Sage. I’m one to be the healer type in any game and I love her walls and slow orbs that can deny entry

Duelist: Gotta say Reyna. Her blind some people consider terrible but it’s pretty good if you place it right and you can also heal yourself and easily reposition

Controller: I rarely play controller/smokes but if I do I would play Harbor. His whole kit is smokes basically and can deny tons of info as well as help entry and provide cover.

Initiator: I usually pick Gekko, his flash is basically impossible to dodge and if you catch where Dizzy flashes then you know where the enemies are. Wingman allows for you to get the plant down while holding angles and declining retake. Mosh and flush out enemies hiding in corners or can get them off the bomb. Thrash can get info like a Skye dog while also detaining people for an easy kill or two on those annoying enemies

I hope this helps, good luck! And remember this is my personal opinion on why I use them

Edit: I took away my other options from each class for a more straight answer
    Reyna's blind is kinda weird, very often I run in front of the blind but the range is also crazy, kind of a double edged sword
        Yeah I agree
Duelist - Neon

Initiator - Gekko, Skye

Sentinel - Sage

Controller - (I don't play Controllers and I don't have any besides Brim)
Kj, omen, harbor, gekko, skye, raze, reyna, jett
Duelist : raze
Sentinel : kj or sage
Initiator : skye
Controller : viper
Sova, Cypher, Phoenix and Brimstone
Deadlock-Raze-Fade-Brim
Yoru/Jett Skye Viper/Omen KJ
Neon duelist KJ sentinel Fade initiator and the love of my life Viper controller
Duelist: Jett
Initiator: Sova
Controller: Harbor
Sentinel: Cypher, although I really want Deadlock to work
what rank is this if its below like plat-diamond its a viable option to choose 1 agent, not 1 from every category just  1  and instalock them always and sooner or later you will reach perfection with that agent after that you can expand your pool
    I'm actually Plastic my brother 🥲🥲. And I like playing Initiators more than anything else.
        take 1 initiator and lock it in every game until your perfect that agent 

if someone else takes it INSTA DODGE (you do not have to do this step it was merely a joke) 

but yea always try to lock in that agent YOU DONT CARE about what others think you do you to your path to higher ranks
It doesn't matter, I just want to click heads.
Kayo, Omen, Killjoy/Cypher. I pick any for duelist
instead of picking one agent from each class, it's better for you to learn one class. And maybe one or two from other classes. I main smoke (except harbor). And know how to play Sova and raze pretty well.
Jett, Skye, KJ, and Omen
Sentinel: Cypher, Initiator: Skye or Kayo but mostly Skye, Duelist: Reyna or Pho, Controller: Omen or Brim
I play raze omen cypher skye/fade
Sentinel: chamber
Initiator: Kayo / sova / skye (it depends on my mood and the map) 
smokes: viper / omen (again, map) 
duelist: raze
i can’t say much about other roles, but as someone with 250? hours on omen alone basically, if ur down to play like a rat then you’ll probably do well. His blind and whole map tps allow for some plays as well. Worst case scenario if you have a lurking duelist random you can always entry with smoke and then TP lol.
Chamber, Neon, Viper, Brim, Sova. 

Both Viper and Brim because Viper as solo Controller is annoying.
Controller: Omen, Astra

Sentinel: Sage/Killjoy (don’t have setups, so Sage in comp)

Initiator: Gekko, Skye, Breach

Duelist: Phoenix, Iso
Cypher - Harbor/Astra - Sova/Skye/Gekko - Reyna/Iso

Depends on the map, I almost never go duelist though. Most people pick flash/smoke in my rank but don't pick a source of info or jump peak or hold a forward angle nearly enough to justify not having a hard info agent.
Controller:Harbour
Sentinel:Harbour
Initiator:Harbour
Duelist:Harbour
I can explain my picks if you would like?
    Yes please 😂😂 explain it. I'm curious
        Controller: Harbour has a smoke, wall and bendy wall.
Initiator: Harbour has an ult that reveals locations.
Sentinel: Harbour uses ult+wall or bendy wall to calculate their IP adress as they are stunned and shoot them.
Duelist: Harbour has aggressive playstyle and fast wall flash style to be able to act as a duelist.
Omen- smokes main

Initiator- skye/fade, sometimes sova
Duelist- Jett
Sentinel- i don’t play
Duelist: Neon. Either if the Chamber is taken or I'm feeling adventurous. Her Fast Lane allows me to entry fast for my teammates, and also fingering people with lightning, who doesn't love that?

Initiator: Gekko. Not really an Initiator player, but his flashes were pretty useful and I can gather info fast with it and plant spike/occasional info gathering with Wingman. It's really funny knifing someone after they got detained by Thrash.

Sentinel: Chamber. My primary go-to agent. His teleporter allowed me to take aggressive angles, allowing me to have a get out of jail free card. I wish he had two trips instead of one though. My aim is still spotty with him however, especially with his headhunter. I also like playing as a rat Chamber with a judge, teleporting away after getting a pick with it.

Controller: Omen. I'm an average smoker, not a great one. I pick him when there isn't anyone who picks a controller. I sometimes do aggressive blind+teleport for some crazy plays. Other than that, I play more as a passive/supportive Omen. Smoking areas where my teams needs it.

This is coming from a Silver 1 Player, btw.
Duelist iso, sentinel deadlock, controller omen, harbor a tiny bit, initiator kay o or skye
Duelist Jett (maybe Phoenix), initiator Skye/kayo, controller brimmy wit the stimmy, sentinel chamber
Sentinel: Cypher

Duelist: I usually play yoru but I’ve been having a lot of fun on Iso

Initiator: definitely my least favorite role but I usually play fade or Kay/O depending on the map

Controller: Astra
my picks would be
viper, cypher/deadlock, fade and iso. they're not particularly good agents, but I like them the most 🫧
Duelist - Neon, I don't play duelist so she's the only one I can easily get into whenever I do

Controller - Brimstone on most maps, Omen for Haven because he's actually broken.

Initiator - Breach

Sentinel - Cypher, his cam is great for retake if it's already on the site.

Duelist: phoenix 
Sentinel: Chamber
Initiator: fade
Controller: Astra
Phoenix.

What is this "fill" you speak of?
Duelist : Raze (all ranks)
Sentinel : Chamber (below plat), Killjoy (all ranks)
Initiator : Skye (flash all ranks), Fade (reveal all ranks)
Controller : Omen (all ranks), astra (immo +)
Cypher, phoenix/Jett, omen/viper/brimmy, and Skye/sova

Anyone else and I'm a turkey on Thanksgiving
Kj sentinel viper/astra controller skye initiator raze/jett duelist
Duelist: phoenix, Initiator: Skye, Controller: Brim, Sentinel: Killjoy
Sentinel: Sage | Controller: Brim (Main) | Initiator: Kay/o | Dualist: Phoenix
Sentinel: KJ or Sage

Controller: Omen

Duelist: Iso

Initiator: KAY/O

(I definitely just wasted 8K credits on Chamber because I thought he would be a more fun Sentinel to play than KJ or Sage... I was wrong, I was so very wrong. Either I'm doing something really wrong but this agent seems quite useless to me and there is no reason to pick him over any other Sentinel.)
If you want improvement quickly, you want to play easy to understand agents that you can get value from.

KJ / Brim / Skye / Jett

If you want to take the time to actually learn agents and provide more value for your team, then:

Cypher / Viper / Skye or Sova / Raze

This isn’t saying the second list has better agents, but they will be a lot more impactful at a mid-high level with the minimal teamwork you’ll see in ranked. Cypher and viper are a lot more self sufficient on defense, sacrificing information. Double satcheling to entry on raze is really strong paired with just a flash, not a lot of coordination needed. Skye and sova are just strong right now so that’s more self evident.

For a more detailed explanation: 

KJ will always get value from her kit. Turret lets you play 6 man essentially, giving extra info. Cypher is stuck on his cam, so while you might have a unique angle, you’re still playing with 5 people’s worth of info. Mollies are guaranteed delay. If your cypher set up is weaker, cages and trips are all able to be bypsssd. But mollies will always do damage when walked through. Her ult is also insanely good. Alarmbot is aggressively mid but whatever.

Cypher needs a more creative set up to get value from, which requires time on the agent. Knowing where to position and which set up to throw matters a lot more than KJ. At a high ascendant/low im level or below though, kill potential matters a lot more than just info gathering, and cypher is strong in that sense.

Brim is just the most straightforward controller. Solid complete kit and easy to learn and solo controller on.

Viper is much harder to solo and basically should never do that. However, the defensive utility is much higher and she’s great to lurk on. Works very well if you’re filling a flexible slot and your team already has an omen/brim. 

Jett is much easier to entry with than raze. Occasionally you want to updraft dash but that’s just 1 extra button press. Call your flashes and dash into smoke, this will be more than enough to climb quickly. 

Raze has a much higher skill floor. You need to take the time to practice satchels both for entry and defensively in the middle of gunfights. Her entries are a lot harder to stop in ranked where the defense isn’t as coordinated

Skye is one of the simpler initiators but way too strong right now. Easy to pick up and good to spend time to fully learn. I had sova as an option for the second list because Skye and sova fill different roles, and this is map dependent.
Brim/Raze/Breach / Kj
I only play 4 agents and they are in order
Duelist: Raze,jett 
Sentinel: kJ,sage, chamber
Initiator : sova,skye
Controller : omen , brim
Omen, Cypher, Raze and Skye
I have barely any agents (only unlocked Killjoy), but I’ll give it a shot. 
(mostly based on appearance, a bit on play style which is team)

Sentinel: Killjoy (main her now)

Initiator: Fade (unlocking her next)

Duelist: Neon

Controller: Astra
Raze kj astra skye
sentinel KJ/Deadlock


controller brimstone


initiator skye 


duelist raze/iso
Duelist: Reyna, and I've been playing Iso since PBE so his util is like muscle memory at this point 

Initiator: Gekko, Skye

Sentinel: Sage, occasionally Chamber 

Controller: I hate the play styles of all of them but I hate Omen the least 

My main agents are Reyna and Gekko but I might swap Reyna for Iso as a main just because I'm lower elo and people haven't figured out how to play against him yet
Neon for Duelist

Basically any Initiator (KAY/O and Breach most though)

Omen for Controller

Deadlock is literally the only sentinel I play ever since I'm the worst Sage you've ever seen
Duelist: Raze or Phoenix
Initiator: Fade, Skye or Sova. Depends on map
Controller: Omen
Sentinel: Cypher
Sentinel: Kj or Cypher
Smokes: Brim an omen
Initiator: Just breach
Duelist: Raze and phoenix
I play primarily controllers so harbor/omen/astra are my go to. Sentinels idk kj maybe? Chamber? Initiator kayo. I don't really play duelists but if I have to then either yoru or Jett
*Main*

KJ

*Classes*

Control: Viper/Omen/Astra

Sentinal: KJ, Sage.

Duelist: Raze, rarely Yoru.

Initiator: Skye.
Sage Phoenix Viper Breach
KJ sentinel (the vision that all kj's robots give its unmatched)

Brimsrone Controller (Excelent post plant and molly + a really easy to use and fast some)

Skye as a initiator (Almost every ability gives you intel and healing)

Phoenix as a duelist (his flashes are very hard to dodge, have healing capabilities and his ult is pretty dope)
phoenix fade astra/harbor chamber
Sentinel = Killjoy (Doesn't really have any bad maps minus Breeze, easy and quite strong)  
Controller = Omen (Mapwide rechargable smokes make him flexible and easy to play and learning one ways makes him a nice agent to main)

Initiator = Skye (Flashes + Drone)  


Duelist = Jett (Easy entry, can OP on defense)
It's honestly best to pick one agent or role and instalock. You'll have trouble developing game sense if you're too dizzy from trying to learn how to play the game in conjunction with learning multiple agents. The play style from role to role is too dynamic for a new player to learn every role.

To be clear you absolutely can play as many agents as you want but you'll wonder why your team is yelling at you for not knowing many good ways to use your utility
Duelist- Jett

Sentinel- Jett

Initiator- Jett

Controller- >!Omen!<
Duelist: Jett (my main i Insta lock if the map is not fracture, bind or lotus)

Instigator: geeko 

Controller: harbour 

Sentinel: kj
KJ, Fade, Reyna, Omen/viper
This one is tough because it depends on map, but if I think through “what’s my default unless map dictates otherwise”:

Duelist: Jett

Controller: Omen 

Sentinel: KJ until recently, now leaning Cypher
 
Initiator: Skye
At low ELO learn how to shoot and have game sense. The agent matters less than those two things.
Just pick a role, please. Understanding your role is equally important to understandjng your agent.
Sage Jett skye brim
Duelist: jett
Sentinel: jett
Controller: jett
I dont play the other roles tbh
Cypher - sentinel
Sova - initiator 
Phoenix - duelist
Brim - smokes
shouldn't fill just pick a role, your team comp really doesn't matter that much and if you're really worried just main controllers and you'll always be able to pick the same thing every round

kj for sentinel has easy value, just at least look up a few setups, chamber if you like awping and trust your aim

jett easiest duelist, smoke + play op

brim is easy (place smokes, and then just be gunner with no util), omen can play like a duelist with tps and flash

if kayo or sova learn lineups but apart from that play whatever initiator tbh
yoru/omen/sova/chamber
Initiator Skye
Duelists Reyna
Controller Omen
Sentinel sage
For Sentinels my top pick is Cypher, sometimes I get silly and try to make Deadlock work.

For Initiators I like playing Skye but I'm not a good Initiator so I turn my brain off with Fade (Srs, just play Fade if you need an easy Initiator)

Main Controller, I play Viper, Astra and Harbor, no hate on Brim and Omen, just not my style.

I usually don't even try Duelist but if I'm feeling quirky I settle for Jett, Iso and Chamber.
I literally only play duelist, but on the off chance i play anything else it looks like this:

Duelist: Raze or Pheonix  
Initator: Skye  
Smokes: Never  
Sentinels: Chamber or Cypher

I havent played alot since summer 2022, so i havent learned any of the new agents LMAO
Harbour for smokes, cypher as sentinel, skye as initator,
Duelist: Raze or Jett 

Controller: Omen

Initiator: Gecko/Skye

Sentinel: Cypher (98% of the time) or KJ
Sentinel: KJ
Controller: Omen
Initiator: Gekko
Duelist: Yoru
duelist - jett
initiator - gekko (i never play initiator)
controller - omen
sentinel - killyjoy
Cypher - Sentinel

Omen - Controller

Sova - Initiator 

Yoru - Duelist

This is my pick if there's like a scenario where "You can only really use 1 agent from every role".

Though in reality, my pick is 100% map dependant:

Split: Astra  
Bind: Yoru   
Haven: Sova  
Breeze: Yoru  
Sunset: Cypher  
Ascent: Sova  
Icebox: Yoru  
Fracture: Breach  
Pearl: Cypher  
Lotus: Harbor
Kj, Brim, Raze, Skye
Depends heavily on how you play but 

Sentinel - kj
Controller - omen 
Initiator - skye 
Duelist - reyna 

Is the basic shit
Neon 
Gekko/skye 
Omen 
Cypher/sage
I mainly play Sentinels/Controllers but I have play a different few depending on map. 

Ascent - KJ,Brim,Sova,Reyna
Bind - Cypher,Brim,Sova,Raze
Breeze - Cypher,Viper,Sova,Reyna
Haven - Cypher(Deadlocke),Omen,Gekko,Reyna
Split - Cypher.Brim,Kato,Reyna
Lotus - Sage,Brim,Kayo(Gekko),Reyna(Phoenix)
Sunset - KJ,Brim,Gekko,Reyna

I’m currently sitting around P3/D1
Kj or cypher, sova, yoru, viper
I play smokes so I pick my mains depending on the maps

 
Bind - brim.
Breeze Icebox - viper.
Sunset pearl - Astra.
Split ascent lotus - omen.
Yoru/Raze duelist, Omen/Astra Controller, Cypher Senti, Fade/ Breach Initiator. 

IMM Player
I think you should play according to the map. It's pretty hard to play consistently with every agent. Initiator is worth only if the duelist is willing to listen to you. So I usually take an initiator only when playing with friends.
It's also worth to learn lineups but again it's better to specialise in a map. I have brim lineups for bind, so he's my default controller.
Chamber + Astra + Skye + Raze
Duelist raze or Jett 

Initiator skye 

Sentinel kj maybe cypher now because of the buff

Controller omen or viper
Cypher, viper/omen, skye, yoru(main)
Sentinal: Sage or Chamber( mostly sage, but occasionally chamber mostly cus I was a chamber main pre nerf) 

Initiator: Sova ( Learn some basic recon lineups )

Smokes: Omen and Brim (only on ascent, as I know Molly lineups for him)

Duelist: Raze or Jett and Reyna only if we are in dire need of flashes.
Yoru
Breech
Astra
Cypher
If you are lower than like immortal you should probably forget about team comps and focus purely on maining one agent. I hate it when people fill onto smokes and then smoke off the stronger site when defending and then the attackers just take the weaker site. This happens because they are not controller mains and dont have enough game time to know when to smoke and when not to.
Sentinel - Cypher/KJ
Duelist - Jett/Raze
Initiator - Sova/Skye
Controller - Omen
Jett, kj, astra, skye, fade
Duelist- deadlock
Initiator- deadlock
Sentinel-deadlock
Controller-deadlock
sentinel: cypher, great on most sites and isn't limited by utility range  
controller: omen, only controller who can initiate with flash and also outplay potential. on bigger map astra/viper probably better  
duelist: yoru. jett and raze probably better but yoru is the one i'm having the most fun with (and i have 0 skill in using satchel to entry)  
initiator: kayo/sova/fade depending on map. sova for big map like breeze, and fade/kayo for map with a lot of corners (sunset, split)
Sentinal: kj  Controller: viper. Duelist: reyna  initiator: skye
Duelist : phoenix. 

Controller : omen and harbor

Initiator : gekko

Sentinel : kj and cypher

I play 6-7 different agents at any given time and it keeps changing every few weeks cuz i play for fun.

In unrated i play everything! Mostly picking agents iam worst at and just goof around
Sentinels: Cypher/KJ love both
Smoke: Astra if forced viper
Initiator: Skye if haven mb Sova
Duellist: Jett
brim, kj, fade, reyna
Duelist: Reyna
Initiator: Fade
Controller: Omen
Sentinel: Chamber
Chamber
Omen
Skye/Fade
Jett/Raze
I'm a casual player so I like agents that are a little flashy and not too difficult to play.
Duelist- jett, raze, reyna

Controller- ASTRA(it's my main i can play it anytime), omen(my prev main), viper(breeze only I'll always pull up a 25k+ with viper on breeze) 

Sentinel- chamber, breach, kay/o, kj

Initiator- sova, gekko, fade

Btw, raze and jett used to be my main agents and i can play raze like no other friend of mine but the thing is that absolutely no person in the whole world knows how to play smokes and i legit have to main smokes in comp games until i have some trusted person to play it instead of me and ekse i would just main raze cause why not i legit love her kit over any other

And the reaon for maining astra is basically that even tho it's a difficult agent tk master but if you know what to do it can work out to be the best agent in the game and the recent buffs have made it capable of attaining it's position in the meta
Jett, brimstone, skye, and killjoy
Chamber for sentinel, Kj comes distant second
Jett for duelist
Skye for initiator
Astra for smokes
Sage for filling
Duelist: Yoru

Initiator: Yoru

Sentinel: Yoru

Controller? Believe it or not: Yoru (don't ask for smokes tho)
I have done the same and I am seeing rank improvements already,
So I mainly use Reyna in Duelist, Sova initiator, Sage sentinel, Omen comtroller,
Initiator: Skye

Controller: Omen

Sentinel: I dont really know, probably sage..? Like i pick sage just cuz i want sage (eg. on sunset), not as a sentinel.. if i had to fill maybe i would pick like cypher or sage

Duelist: Raze (iM a hArDcOrE iNsTaLoCk bOtFrAg rAzE uHUhhHuU)
Phoenix duelist
Initiator Sova
Sentinel Cypher
Controller Brimstone
Brim or Omen on smokes, whatever you're more comfortable playing. Just place the smokes properly so the edge of the smokes are flush against what door or whatever you're blocking

Skye on initiator for how strong those birds are doubling as scouting and flashes. I don't mind Sova but other than Ascent his best maps aren't in the active pool right now.

KJ on sentinel because the turret and alarmbot make holding the flank easy. And the threat of her having her ult is enough to change how the game is played.

Raze on duelist because AoE damage makes up for the fact you're probably going to get out-aimed by your instalocking opposite number.
Cypher as sentinel, Reyna/Raze/Neon as duelist, Omen as Smokes, sky initiater
Sentinel: KJ (easier to get decent setups just by knowing agent’s basics, cypher is also cool but harder imo)

Controller: Brimstone (I would’ve picked omen but brims’ smokes are bigger / stay longer and his ult is way better) and learn viper’s setup for breeze coz sadly a map rework wasn’t enough to have her swapped with someone else. (Harbor could work aswell but ehhh idk I prefer a viper in my team)

Initiator: Skye (too good, works in all maps, easy to setup plays with and once you learn how to flash properly it’s ez)

Duelist: Jett (I can’t recall a map where she doesn’t work or she’s useless but I might be wrong)


Even if I’d still recommend to stick to max 2 roles, you will hardly fill on duelist and idk on sentinel maybe learn KJ’s basics so you’ll be able to do ur own in extreme cases.
Sentinel - Viper  
Initiator (small maps) - Astra  
Initiator (big maps) - Harbor  
Duelist (No Diving duelist) - Omen  
Duelist (1 or more Diving duelist) - Brimstone   


:)
As a common immo cypher main i would go, cypher- sentinel, cypher- duelist, cypher - initiator, cypher- controller and sometimes chamber as cobtroller
Omen, brim, viper. If taken, fade is easy af to use.
Duelist: Yoru cuz he cute  
Sentinel: KJ (duh)   
Initiator: Skye   
Controller: HARBOR MAIN LETS GOOOOOOOO no but for real, I love harbor, he gets shit   on for being so mid and of course viper bae is usually the queen, but I love my wet boy.
Duelist Raze
Initiator Skye
Controller Astra (on certain maps brim or Viper)
Sentinal Kj or Cypher its just map specific
Omen/(harbor? im trying him out rn) for controler, breach for initiator, cypher for sentinel and iso for duelist
Raze

Skye

Omen

Killjoy
Jett, reyna, phoenix, iso, or worst case scenario I can play neon
Duelist: Raze and Reyna ( used to play yoru but got bored ) 
Initiator: all except breach ( cuz breach needs more team coordination and don't get that in low elos) 
Controller: viper and brim ( got bored of playing omen and astra needs team coordination imo ) 
Sentinel: kj and cypher ( depends on the map )
Cypher, breach, jett and viper/brim
My recommendations for agents is to MAIN A ROLL. And only fill if you arent fast enough to lock. I play cypher for sentinel, viper and astra for smokes, raze for duelist, and fade for initiator. The only reason i even play viper is for breeze and when they are in the map pool icebox and pearl. You can play any agent effectively with basic gamesense but I agree its best to narrow your scopes.
Sova, breach, kayo, skye, fade, sometimes gekko
Kj/cypher Sentinels, astra smokes, skye initiation, yoru/iso/raze or neon for duellist.
In my opinion I don't think you should fill, just play agents you are comfortable with.
From a silver perspective, KJ, viper, sky, and I don't play duelist ever
jett - jett - jett - jett
Spam chamber and peek every angle
harbor/iso/viper/reyna/skye/jett/gekko
Same. Although I'd prefer Brim instead of Viper. She is only good on some maps (Breeze)
    Viper is good on *almost* every map, specifically effective on Breeze, Icebox, Split, Fracture, Bind and Pearl. The rest are alright with the exceptions of Haven and Ascent, where I personally hate having a Viper.

I just don't think she's as effective as it could be and any smokes (Astra specifically) does the job better. Haven because it's too big and Ascent mainly because it's a very flexible map where I prefer having a more flexible smoker like Brim, Astra or Omen
    try viper on split, ascent, sunset, bind, haven and lotus. She's the goat on every map but breeze (unless u have seconds smokes). She can solo all these maps except for like bind unless you have a lineup for her orb from b to a to land in short.
    So is brim tbh
        Brim is good on most maps besides breeze
            As a brim main Im dreading the Pearl and Icebox comeback :(
            I play Brim on Breeze and won like 80% of them
                Ok but viper is just better on breeze
                    I agree. Harbor as well.
                I'm assuming you're not a high rank then
                Brim main 70%.. harbor for breeze for sure
    Viper is not a good solo controller for ranked and with this in mind, she's good on quite a few more maps, if not all of them. It's just tricky playing viper as a secondary on ranked.
This guy knows what's good
i think we share the same brain
    I think we share the same brain x2
same here but astra instead of viper as of rn
legit so easy to climb with brim and sova
I disagree with this. I had experience with every agent by the time I hit diamond. I think it’s good to play everyone and see how they work. It will only make you a better player against them. Now I’m ascendant almost immortal and I switch between 4-5 agents.
    Of course you still need to know how the agents work. But the floor is infinitely easier to achieve, just spend some time in range or custom and watch pro vods, no need to spend 100 hours playing them yourself. And trust me, people are not as good at their agent as they think. There are countless diamond/ascendant skyes that fail their fucking flash half the time for example. At least you're in ascendant, god forbid some silver thinks they can fill an agent.
    Yeah. Especially with the playerbase and their egos. I get the most wins when I fill.
I predominantly play Initiators and have been trying to squeeze in most of my matches as Skye. And I like playing Brim and Viper too. So should I only play these agents? (Skye mainly and Brim as priority for smokes)
    Ideally two of the same agents from the same class but yes, try to stick with 2. Reason being that every class has designated "tasks" within the team and learning what you're supposed to be doing is something people up to immortal (and even a fair number of Immortals) struggle at.


With Skye/ initiators, you need to learn where flash zones are, how to gather good intel, and how to coordinate with your duelist to support their entry.


With Brim/controllers, you need to have a good read on the map to smoke the correct places on time, understand how different smoke setups will affect how enemies play, and learn what advantages/disadvantages each smoke location has as you could be actively hurting your team with bad smokes.


Because of these differences, you'll have different priorities (who watches flank, what order you enter site, who dodges the defending flashes on entry, etc) so it can be difficult to learn to play two different class to the same effectiveness. You'll likely get better, faster by sticking to one class.
    Just instalock. It really does not matter and people who flame you really have no reason to. Filling really doesn't help when you don't know the ins and outs of an agent.  

Playing an agent you know is always better than just filling in a role you're not great at.
what is low elo? below dia/asc? i’m playing jett astra deadlock atm but 2 of them are mainly filling
    Wouldn't play more than 2 below asc
seriously, this. was filling nearly every game for a month and was hardstuck plat 1. played Iso for a week consistently and not only has my aim gotten much better but I'm already plat 3 50 rr. consistency is key to rank up
I predominantly play Initiators because I like them so much as I can play support role for my team. In fact the first player that I played with in the tutorial top was Sova. But I saw some videos and people talking about filling is good and pick one agent for each class. So should I keep on playing just Initiators? I play smokes too sometimes when I wanna have fun.
    Pick 2 agent per role that you’re ok-ish at, just incase you HAVE to fill. Dont really practice them, just make sure you have one you’re not useless on if you really have to.

Pick a main role and get comfortable on it, then pick a secondary role and get somewhat comfortable on it. 80% of games you Probably get role 1, 15% role 2 and 5% fill
    I don't think there's a single map that you absolutely shouldn't play skye on
    If Initiator is fun to you, stick to them, yeah. Something to keep in mind though is that the way you play Initiators with a flash (flash intiators) and ones without (recon initiators) is very different, so I'd suggest keeping to one or the other.
This is the way OP. The way our game sense develops would be different per role and so as Boza said its hard to switch around different mindsets in an effective way. 

So far the only good advice I've seen in ur post's comment section
Thanks man, I'll start grinding on those agents and also improving my comms
Damnnn, you took away Cypher from his original class and put him everywhere else 😂😂. Care to explain?
This actually works if you have inferior opponents. The camera works as a flash(distractor), the cages are smokes and both combined, you become an initiator. 

And if you are carrying, you are not going to play defensively anyways so not a sentinel. This comment makes total sense.
This is the way
Idk about DL and Harbor (because I haven't even unlocked them) , but I kinda like Yoru and Gekko, so I can feel you
Hmm that's actually a good point. I mainly play Initiators and recently unlocked Skye as she is meta rn. So I guess I'll start grinding her that way I can play as both flash and recon agent
Reyna's blind is kinda weird, very often I run in front of the blind but the range is also crazy, kind of a double edged sword
    Yeah I agree
I'm actually Plastic my brother 🥲🥲. And I like playing Initiators more than anything else.
    take 1 initiator and lock it in every game until your perfect that agent 

if someone else takes it INSTA DODGE (you do not have to do this step it was merely a joke) 

but yea always try to lock in that agent YOU DONT CARE about what others think you do you to your path to higher ranks
Yes please 😂😂 explain it. I'm curious
    Controller: Harbour has a smoke, wall and bendy wall.
Initiator: Harbour has an ult that reveals locations.
Sentinel: Harbour uses ult+wall or bendy wall to calculate their IP adress as they are stunned and shoot them.
Duelist: Harbour has aggressive playstyle and fast wall flash style to be able to act as a duelist.
Viper is good on *almost* every map, specifically effective on Breeze, Icebox, Split, Fracture, Bind and Pearl. The rest are alright with the exceptions of Haven and Ascent, where I personally hate having a Viper.
