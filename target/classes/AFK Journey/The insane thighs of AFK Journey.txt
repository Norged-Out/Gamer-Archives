[[The insane thighs of AFK Journey]]


Last one especially got me acting up!


I know this is a meme, but the fact that you didn't also put Antandra? smh
    And Mirael?!
    Right? Goddang Antandra is bae.
        Antandra is love, Antandra is life
            Antandra is jiggle
    Her victory walk though 🥵
my dude keeps jumping on tombstones all day everyday. he definitely has the leg muscle.
You forgot top tier thighs Reinier and Seth
ngl I did pull atalanta purely for the looks factor and personality rather than gameplay, but I'll force myself to find a use for her
    I have found my people
    You won't have to. She's good tank/dps. Put smoky and koko you already getting faction bonus
        Maybe u mistake her for antandra
            Yup. Rowan and lucius then
        Atalanta is not Mauler.
Igorrrr
    Thighor
Parisa mommy
    glad i'm not alone in that thought of her 🤣
Some of these characters really be strutting on the victory screen, too
Woulddddddd😍😍😍😍😍😍
dem they thicc as hell, i just realized that.
    WTF is your definition of thicc? None of that is Thicc at all
        I’m sure women LOVE being around you in real life
            Dude hasn't been with a real woman in his entire life
            You are correct, but that doesn’t answer my question. Please stay on topic and avoid trying to be a witty smart ass, but instead just sounding dumb af.
                Okay buddy
                    Okay indeed lol.
                        Jikes…
        They're booing you but you're right lmao These are some normal ass looking thighs, that words lost all meaning.
            Typical Reddit so it’s all good. Most likely a bunch of weirdos who have no real idea what actual thickness is.
                Thick =/= Thicc you fossils
                    It’s just a misspell on purpose, it does mean thick. Literally and I’ve never seen anything that shows otherwise. They’re CURVY not thick or thicc.
        Dude cassadee is thicc as hell her hips are almost twice the width as her torso wth. Idk about the others though, parisa is kinda pear shaped thicc though
Ahahahah the last one make me laugh
And where's my waifu Granny Dahnie? Her thighs can crush my pelvis
Cassadee got no business being that thiccc

And her shorts are cute
    don't forget about Fay either
Lol the last one. Love it.
I really wish Atalanta and Parisa were more useful, because they sure got the eye candy
    that alt skin is literally the only reason I'm bothering with the honor dual right now.
        Get passes > init round > instant forfeit is the way, comrade
            I'm finally at 400/500 points, almost there!
Would all of them
This game is amazing especially on bluesatcks since they added auto tuning for better results
so hot ❤️ i mean the last one of course
as opposed to dislyte, farlights other game, where the women have outrageous chest sizes
I mistakenly scrolled to the next post and thought this was the last picture

Didn't expect Igor to be there but...🤤
Get my head crushed between them and I'd say 'thank you' 🫠

(Also vala has a skin?????)
Mirael too
Igor had me dying. A+ my dude.
Cassadee my baby girl

Honest to god Igor is so annoying
AYOOO
Im down so bad for cassadee the moment i saw her introduced in the official afk insta page. The same for faye as well
Dang... The last one though... My God, Dura above!
Came on last on
You thought you could sneak in the first 4 and we wouldn’t notice
Mirael with her thigh high skirt slit
Chippy's thighs🤤
They look mighty tasty too my favorite is my Elf Queen 🤤
Hear me out...

    Pixels aren't virtual. Seek help.
And Mirael?!
Right? Goddang Antandra is bae.
