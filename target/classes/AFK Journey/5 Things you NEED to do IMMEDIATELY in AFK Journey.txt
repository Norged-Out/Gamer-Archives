[[5 Things you NEED to do IMMEDIATELY in AFK Journey]]


Hey everyone, today I wanted to break down once again the things you should focus on to get the best start in AFK Journey on Day 1. These will help you grind the best resources, gain the best progress, and have the most fair competition with your gaming!!!

1. Pick the right server
2. Join a Guild ASAP (they aren't cross server)
3. Don't bother saving summons, go all in
4. Push AFK Progress ASAP

If you need a guild join the Celestials Discord here: [https://discord.com/invite/clsgg](https://discord.com/invite/clsgg)


Make sure to avoid s1~s7 because these  opened hours (approximately 7h) ago and people that downloaded the apk are already playing there
    Agreed
Luckily in the perspective of several months even if they add cross server content a day difference between servers s1-7 and the ones what starts tomm doesn't matter much :D

But the difference of a month++ is gonna matter so ye. AFK games is all about starting early xD
    Where do I see wich server I'm on?
You forgot the most important tip. Have fun
    100%
How to select the server I want to play?
    up! I want to know too
    You can switch character in settings and start on a different server.
    Newest server is always the ideal server for games like this, safe to assume that‚Äôs also the case here.
Why not save summons? Should I be using gems? And which banners are worth it?
So, there‚Äôs no need to reroll in this game right?
    Correct
        Alright!
why do i have to pick the right server?
    You want to be on the newest otherwise you might face people that have been playing longer than you which means harder to rank high in dream realm
        i've never played afk J before. how do i know if my server i picked is new?
            The game will auto assign you to the newest server don't worry. Just don't manually pick a lower number server
                Or do if your friends are all there and you intend to play with them. The first 24h won't change much one month from now, and the difference is not worth playing all alone. Guilds and Friend Lists are not cross-server
        While this is true just kno ull still face people like me who will insta drop a few hundred to get max dupes for full kits lol. But atleast u want be facing as many people stronger than u right off rip
I wish there was a global server, it would make things very interesting
Which server is ideal?
    Whichever is the newest one when you start üòÅ
Which server is your guild on?
Should i start it now or in the morning?
    Either work. New servers coming out like every hour so many players
In general I just want to know if I should be prioritizing certain units? I am so confused on wether or not there is a meta or not.

It‚Äôs not complete but it gives sort of an idea of which heroes are consistent high performers or which ones are really strong niche picks
Whats the 5th one ¬∞-¬∞
the discord is not working, could you please send it again
    It was hacked and deleted..., they are fixing it today
I would also advise trying to play on BS after the phone, as it seemed like a different game to me
    There is also a full PC client as well you can try on landscape too
        Yes, it works worse than the version on the emulator, but that‚Äôs just me and my characteristics
