Hey, nice, I was looking for a new Tales of game that cost $20,000 instead of $20.
I imagine... genshin impact:afkarena edition?
    So .... I will login and afk for primo gems?
    For real. I thought I was in the Genshin Impact subreddit for a moment
        Without NSFW and tons of image, somehow better GI subreddit
    +1, same thought
I'm assuming that we would see some heroes from that game in AFK Arena.
    definitely most if not all of them (not counting dimensional collabs)
    Maybe we could even fight along side them
Imma keep my mind open about the game, I just ask that it's not very time-consuming, and is as f2p friendly as possible.
    Genshin is very f2p friendly so I am.. hopeful, at least.

people think oh greedy Lilith, but they're truly super f2p friendly compared to other gachas
        I completely agree both games are surprisingly f2p friendly in comparison to other gachas, especially Genshin, so hopefully, Lilith follows in their footsteps.
            Wow this sentiment that Genshin is F2P friendly surprises me.  I felt the opposite (at launch).  Itâ€™s subjective I guess.
                Probably depends on what kind and amount of f2p you've been exposed to prior.
                I have played genshin since launch and you can do all the available content with the free characters, if that's not f2p  friendly then I have no idea what it is, if you are asking for free pulls then that's a different story but that's not f2p friendly, just to give you a clear example of a NOT f2p friendly KOTZ, you can pass all the content without paying because they made some content beatable with exclusive characters which is ridiculous.
            I think it's the best move for them to make yeah :) very excited to read and see more about it. it's been in development for like almost two years at the absolute minimum
        It's insane to me that mobile gamers have this mindset. "This company doesn't fuck us over as hard as the other ones."
            I'm not sure what that's supposed to mean. fuck you over? no one is making you play, let alone pay.

yes, they are indeed a company, and it is in fact their job to make money. to pay their employees, etc. so yes they monetize the game, it's a gacha, what else do you expect?

I'm saying, compared to every other gacha out there, Afk is much more friendly. you can literally be a top player f2p if you just play smart.
No thanks Lilith, Iâ€™m good. Thatâ€™s cool though.
3D? Insta-skip
    Yep, fuck that on a phone
    How?
the meme became real
    was never a meme, it was confirmed by the director of AFK almost 2 years ago
        (?) So? it was always a meme. People been joking about that since almost 3 and a half years ago

        https://www.facebook.com/AFK2Journey/

works for me.
            thanks for this, liked and followed. this works.
        link broken

Edit: yall click it yourself, wdym downvotes
            It's a new-reddit thing. Cultured old reddit users, like ourselves, get broken links from there.
Given how this looks like a Genshin clone, I hope they take the same path and make this also available on Steam/Consoles. I tried Genshin on iPad and it was painful, works FAR better on Ps4. If this isn't on consoles, it's a hard pass for me.
    Iâ€™d love a PS5 port
official announcement or leak? either way, it's legit. AFK Genshin incoming??
I hope we get to meet/play as all of our favourite AFK Arena characters.  Donâ€™t mess this up, Lilith.
LMAO is that Brutus in the sky!? First he gets awakened now he pulls a Mufasa lol
As long as you play as the hamster thing I'm in
So it's a rip off genshin?
    And genshins a rip off of Breath or the wild so what?
        Which makes the lilith game 2 layers deep of rip off lmao, don't see how that's meant to make it better
            Means pointing out anything is a ripoff is a moot point, Because every game is a rip off of something and shows your bias towards Genshin impact and in turn your only purpose in commenting was to fan boy Genshin and show your ass ðŸ˜‰
                The funny thing is I don't play or like genshin though, you're just incorrect
I'm hyped for this!
    How? It's gonna be like every other genshin clone
It's a baby :D
Where can i find more info abt this? Gg didnt turn up anything
    it's brand new. we find out more when Lilith gives us more
Details?
Not my cup of tea, hopefully they will keep supporting the original game...
trailer when
more p2w garbage no thanks. This be my last p2w game i play.. switching over to real games
Fingers crossed for a pc/console port. Hate playing games like this on tablet and phone
Out of all the things afk2 could have been. This is the least exciting.
I think they should just drop the name AFK, nothing afk about rpg's lol
Dropping this here for now : https://www.reddit.com/r/AFK2Journey/
    just trying to solidify yourself as the owner of a subreddit or..
        well, it's a new game, and thus needs a new subreddit. it would be a nightmare to try and handle both communities on this sub. it's only natural to make a new sub, and well, here it is. I followed it! I'm excited to see where this game goes
        I guess so yeah, I think I was pretty successful with this subreddit so I wouldn't mind taking care of this new one.
I hope it releases soon I am excited for it
Hope it's fake, cause I was waiting for new Afk Arena like game, ideally Afk Arena 2, cause in such games starting as soon as possible is crucial for F2P experience. Well, at least 3D games on mobile should be satisfied.
We're can I download this app?
Hugeee so excited
Oo this looks cool
Lilith trying to.make another genshin killer, nothing is stopping genshin
It is available already?
Hope it's more like genshin and tower of fantasy, and not auto runner nino kuni, and the other.
