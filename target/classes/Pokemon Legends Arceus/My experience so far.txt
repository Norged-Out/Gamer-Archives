[[My experience so far]]





Someone could just spend an hour getting supplies
    It’s me I’m someone
        It's us, we are someone
            Correct comrade.
    Every time I told myself to continue with the story I was like "well, couldn't hurt to grab a few more tumblestones and leeks." If I'm in town it's like "but did I talk to THAT NPC?"
        For me it's always "oo new Pokemon, it wouldn't hurt to grind out the Pokedex real quick." Hence why I reached 8 stars before completing the second area.
            Same. The  exploration and side quests can really just suck you in. I reached 4 stars before even completing the 1st area and got to evolve my starter to its 2nd evolution before fighting the 1st boss.
            I'm so close to 8 stars and I'm in the second area as well because of this exact reason.
                Wait are you telling me that I can just talk to fem Cyrus and increase my star and that isn't locked behind story mode like MonHunt?
                    Yes
                        well damn my life, I didn't have to spent 1 extra hour last night on the story to get 4\* for ladden ball if I knew this.
                As someone who blasted through the main story, you played the right way. When you get to the end you’ll understand why I’m saying that.
            Almost to the 7th star, and I'm considering entering the second area until after I get it. And it definitely hard to get more points.
                Honestly I played naturally and went with the flow; I’m at 8 stars and grind abit here and there on the 3rd are but seeing as there are two more areas, I would say I’m in a good position, after reaching new areas and catching fighting new Pokémon it’s easier to get more points; granted even for me I’m overleveled, if you havnt changed your team much im sure you are too, even more than me entering area 2
                    I just went back and forth between side quests and main story depending on what I wanted to work on. Pretty much got to 8 stars by the 3rd location. Ngl tho I kinda went through the story real quick by that point because I had people try and spoil the story for me so kinda rushed through to avoid it.
                        Damn here I am at 6 stars nearly at the end of the story, maybe I should explore some more.
                            Definitely side tracking is what makes the game fun, exploring hard to reach places or off the way, you’ll encounter Pokémon you wouldn’t if you just went straight with the story
            How in the world, I’m star 2 and I just whooped the shit outta ursuluna
            Me reaching 8 stars and having a level 60 team before I even leave the first area
        Then you look at the time and it's 1 a.m.
    Me farming Sky Tumblestones
    I do!
    Small correction, everyone will spend 10 hours getting supplies
    What I'm starting to do is put ¥20,000 or so every once in a while into crafting  materials to lessen the grind a bit.
        Naw all money goes to that DB satchel space
            26 hours in and the only thing I’ve spent money on is storage space
                A little fashion for me. (I look like the riddler) but the rest, sachelssssss
                Buying Pokemon moves were great early on but not necessarily needed. Some just to cover the teams movesets.
                    Do you even need to really battle much? I’ve never really found myself needing a good party yet about 4 areas into the game and have just been XP grinding with the spaces. I feel like it’s just faster to throw attempt rather than battle.
                    Where do you buy Pokemon moves
                        The trainer (martial arts lady) in the town
                I was the same until I realized that I never crafted in the wild so there was no need to be scammed by Bagins any longer.
                Does anybody know where it ends? Last space I paid 40K for an additional slot and he was still asking me if I wanted to learn more. I’m like bro am I paying for a large hadron collider at this point?
                    The last one is a million i believe. Think you spend like 4.2 million in total.
                        This man is about to build the largest mansion in town from selling space.
                            > selling space.



He's a Pearl operative
                                Diamond clan rise up
                                Got ‘m.
                Yup. I'm like 20 hours and literally ONLY buying satchel space so far. There's plenty of resources you can collect for everything. Can't find satchel space in the wild.
            Agreed, satchel space and maybe the occasional move tutor move.
    I went from level 10 pokemon to level 30 pokemon just collecting resources... story wise I should only be at a single star.
    Makes me feel like I'm playing old school monster hunter
    An hour? I spent two days gathering and crafting stuff. This is my jam. I'm in love with this game.
    You can buy all the supplies in the village you know. Easy enough to make money with selling star pieces and submitting reports too
        This what I’ve been starting to do. I’ve bought some bag upgrades. But I feel like I need get get a bunch of supples so I can make sure I don’t run out and then not have room in my bag for them. Currently I have 100+ of the first 3 potions. About the same for revives. Currently trying to get enough materials for poke balls. I’m almost rank 8 and only in the 2nd area.
    Yes, but then the problem is that you end up catching pokemon while gathering supplies and you end up in the same spot.
    I quite literally beat the entire game and completed about 75% of the pokedex before I realized there's a guy in town who sells crafting materials such as iron chunks.
Or medicinal leeks x 1000
    You can never have too many leeks
        Every trip minus farming them I’m down to like 1 revive and 3 leeks. I only return when my mostly expanded bag is full and I’ve got like 1 poke left or 0.
            Save your resources. If you're just out and not focusing on the main story just pop into a camp to heal instead of using your items
                Yea revali’s gale I mean Braviary makes it easier to get back to where I left off. Just put the lil flag marker down before I fast travel sometimes
                    ravioli spotted
        *happy Farfetch’d noises*
    There’s literally a sidequest that requires 100 of those, and from what I’ve heard, buying them from the caravan doesn’t progress the quest. 

Meaning you have to collect 100 medicinal leeks in the wild and avoid the urge to use them yourself for all that time. 

On the bright side, the intro to the quest is somewhat funny (not spoiling that intro, see it for yourself). (For the record, the nurse lady in the HQ building gives this quest after a while)
        I just bought them and turned them in so that does work.
            I can't find where to buy them!
                Right by your room, the lady on the right sells berries and vegetables. The guy on the right has random deals and sometimes rare items!
                    Thank you so much!
                    Speaking of the other caravan guy who has random deals, how often does that refresh? I’m currently not very far into the postgame, and I’m hoping I haven’t permanently missed any rare items.
                        Not sure but I'm assuming it's similar to the field where you grow apricorns and mints so probably how many pokemon you've caught.
Me who just uses pokeballs
    Me who even lack pokeballs
        same. used them all on buizels
            I caught the Alpha one. Helped me save a lot of time I guess.
                If only we can find this damn alpha and also fuckin cherrim, I’m 3areas in and have not been able to catch either, cherrim was a pain in the ass the first time she appeared so I killed her and now I never see her for the quest
                    Buizel is there in region 1. If you want I can give you the location.
                        The alpha buizel is random. Every buizel that spawns has a 2% chance of being alpha (same as every Pokémon) Everytime you refresh the encounter table (you can either catch them all and sleep on camp, or get out and get back into the area, I think)
    Is this what they’re using iron chunks for? For the great balls?
    I’m planning to complete the entire game with only regular red balls. Doing so has freed up lots of bag space.
        Good luck with that lol
        Ultra balls take the same resources as 2 regular balls + 2 iron. You will definitely use more regular balls than ultra balls to catch the same pokemon. It's just not worth it for 1 bag slot.
        It’s not really that much bag space for a great ball.
    [deleted]
        I think it's just you haha  


I normally always throw regular balls, but in this game it's not that easy...
    Same loooool

I’ve got like 500+ iron in my storage lmfao
        How on Arceus' green earth did you get that many? I wanna know some good locations.
            I just try not to use Wyrdeer much for travel because I pick less stuff up, and at the same time I don’t craft any balls that need iron chunks lmfao. It’s just around 45~ hours of picking up every chunk I see lmao.

I’ve only been using Pokéballs because of my OCD-ish need for uniformity.
I haven’t played a Pokémon game in so long that kept me addicted to playing . And you have different ways to play . I can just go forage and relax , go hunt for outbreaks , main quest , or just do side missions
    It’s my favorite, by a lot.
    Been hunting for alphas. How can you not drop everything when you see one?
        I ignore them because I have no poke balls half the time also I don’t want to die 😭.
            just escape at last mon. You cant fail this game
        Full Pokedex out of alphas, everyone?
My step son: "I've got two Noble Pokemon down and I'm in the third area! Yay!" Play time: 1 day.

Me: "I'm only in the second area, and I only have one Noble pokemon down. But man, have I got pokedex entries and crafting materials galore." Play time: 3 days.

He's also 2 star ranked but I'm 4 star ranked lol.
    I only just got to the second area and am Star Level 6 🥲 I can't help but to perfect the Pokédex entries.
        That's not bad at all! If you complete all of them, not only will you get a higher odds for shiny pokemon - you'll also get a shiny charm for the full research dex!

And most of all, all those pokeball checkmarks look so damn nicely in the pokedex.
            I kinda wish the dex was nicer to scroll through though, a proper grid would be nice (just lore it as an "index" page idk)
            Wait you have to perfect the whole dex for a shiny charm. That's a LOT
                Nah, you don't, you just need research lv10 on all pokemon
                    Oh. OP said they are perfecting every entry so I thought you meant that as well.
        I got to 7 before I went to the second area, but then I started thinking... "if I could swim AND fly, this would be a lot easier". 

So I've gotten one of those things so far.
        I'm still area 1 with 6 star so don't worry. I've also had to stop along the way and complete a dex entry as I come across a Mon
        the only thing from keeping me going through the story is online spoilers
I get incredibly distracted just doing a single request
    Is the bugger still not 2’8? :P
[removed]
    What stage of the game are you at? They become pretty common after the second area.
        [removed]
            That's what I'm loving about this game. I'm 10+ hrs in and just began the Kleavor quest. I spent 3hrs last night finding a munchlax, leveling it up, evolving it, and just exploring. Feels like what pokemon should have been from the beginning.
                I cannot find a munchlax!!! Any tips??
                    Go to the obsidian area and catch/defeat the bug pokemon around. They share the same spawns. You can go to the hilltop camp to rest to reset the spawns. Probably took around 30-45min to get it. Then I found two!
                        I was grabbing a drink and one ran up to me I tried to run away and it followed me and I caught it, are they rare?
            Oh, you’re still in the first area then.
                [removed]
                    I've spent 8 hours grinding out ideal nature Pokemon, trying to get Dustox or even a Cascoon has been a struggle because they all want to evolve into Silcoon. I know I should progress the story, I know I should move on so that time isn't stopped on the first afternoon, but I cant bring myself to do so.

I've collected 600 apricorns in my storage so far.
                        You can use mints to change natures
                            Ah, thank you, I thought they might be in it somewhere. I find it more rewarding to catch them with the right nature but if it starts getting boring I'll keep it in mind and just move on.
                    By the third area every rock generally will give at least 1 iron chunk multiple from iron rocks
                    It’s a lie. I’m in the fourth area. Iron chunks are still in short supply
                        Uhmmm go back to area 2. Don't deny things you can't see.
                            yup just finished Kleavor got the great ball recipe finally. like a freaking tool i didn’t realize i was throwing feather balls for almost the entire area. Wondering why i couldn’t catch shit.
                                But those are great. I usually use them.
                                    not when you’re trying to catch Hippopotas
                        Use the second mount for finding stuff.

I assure you, you'll probably end up using the mount for looking for evolution stones.

You will not find evolution stones. You will find dozens of iron chunks.
            There is a cave around the far eastern part of the map that has several iron nodes to farm. I still haven't left the 1st area, so running that cave has stocked my GreatBall needs.
                Yes, you can fast travel to grand arena and go there. Reset and do again if you're lazy.
                [removed]
                    There's lots of machop in the area just so you know you're headed the right direction
    Tons of them in shake rocks with geodudes if you knock them out you'll get like 10 or so if its iron chunks.  The second area is more full of them than the first.

Edit. Higher the star rank, higher the rewards from harvesting resources. Miniscule but it stacks.
    Tbh I’ve started just buying the materials as I need more balls. I have so much money from expeditions it’s barely anything, and I still have plenty left for bag upgrades. I still collect materials while out, but I’m catching faster than I’m finding a lot of the time.
        Ahhahaa wait til you encounter a mass breakout you use a slot of balls on
    Ultras take twice as much iron. Happy hunting!
I went on a shopping spree and spent 40k$ on chunks. I'm set for a while.
    Where’d you buy them??
        There’s a shop/guy in the main section of the village that sells recipes and materials!
            Aka the dude you build the dolls for, he’s got the only crafting station I can find. Stash? Next to door. Crafting station? 1/2 mile away lol
                [deleted]
                    Yep. You also don't need to transfer items from the bottomless box to your inventory if you use the stationary crafting stations, as those use items from both your box and satchel
I have a harder time maintaining the nuts used to make balls.
    Make it a habit to punch every single tree you see and you'll have more than you could ever need in no time. The only thing I find myself needing more of are sky tumblestones and iron chunks.
        I've intentionally punched every Apricorn tree I've seen (going out of my way), spent blocks of time just running around grinding them, and my farm is perpetually producing Apricorns. I can never keep up. Sky Tumblestones and Iron Chunks are often low supply but Apricorns are the major scarcity for me.

Maybe it has a lot to do with individual catching style. How many balls you're throwing out, which ones you choose to use more frequently.
            Yeah maybe that's it. I play stealthily most of the time so I rarely need more than one ball per Pokémon. I just started practicing with feather balls so maybe I'm short on those because my aim isn't the best with those yet lol
                Do you know if they white flying pokemon in the first area thats kinda way up is catchall with featherballs? I tried to hit him so many times but no luck.
        See I have a couple thousand of each of those lol. I need the medicine stalks and poke ball nuts. (I still can’t remember the actual names lol)
            Apricorns! And you should try farming them in the town if you aren’t already, that’s helpful
Edited a word
        how do u punch?
            I meant send your pokemon
                oh, i thought u can personally punch the tree
        Going after my dex I always keep a low level new Mon in my team to throw at trees and rocks and level it up
    I prefer the punching trees method below. I just got everything all the time with Pokémon to get a little exp and item farm. But you an also grow apricorns shhhh
    Ask the farmer in town to grow you an apricorn harvest!
For me, basically every other excursion is purely collecting materials.
After having to use [one of the mounts] to HOPEFULLY find evolution stones in the ground, I have enough iron chunks to support an entire family of pokeballs.

Note: I found about 3 evolution stones, none of which were the ones I needed. I did, however, find a generous vein of iron chunks. There's like 200 sitting in my chest.
    I think you can buy evolution stones from the lady to the left of the galaxy building. She’s at a stall.
        Well, yes, but I also had to buy other evo items from her, so I couldnt really afford the stones.
            Ah alright. Yeah, that currency is hard to come by.
            What stones you looking for? I can see if I have them tomorrow if you still need. I know I have a few of the thunder water and fire, and probably one of each other one
another tip i maybe missed: 

- the bonus for Pokémon caught ends after 30 Pokémon
   - check in with Laventon every thirty for max bonuses if you're farming
I need to catch 10 more bidoof.
    I need to use poison powder 40 times for 6 different mons.
        Damn.
        [deleted]
            Im not sure if theres a reward for a finished Perfect dex besides extra shiny rolls, but a finished Complete dex (level 10 everything) gives the shiny charm
                [deleted]
                    Its hard to explain but heres a picture thatll help https://ibb.co/jG1Z6Tb
You can pick up items while mounted. So easy to breeze through an area for leeks, chunks, and chokes
    I wish you could throw your pokemon out at trees while mounted though
    after you get the water mount it auto switches mounts for you, so if you jump into the water it hot-swaps
You can buy crafting materials from the recipe guy, real life saver
You get more iron if you progress in the story though
I stopped wasting time gathering supplies because time distortions sometimes yield gold nuggets and just buy them instead.
I used up all my markers on maps with iron chunk locations 🥹
Has anyone noticed a Request that opens up the option to buy Iron Chunks from a merchant in town? Or do I just keep making chunk runs every hour on the hour lol
    You can just buy them from the crafting guy, I think either after you get to the second or third map.
Me going from map to map collecting satchels for like no reason
Hahaha! Sameee! I spend forever just exploring and gathering materials. Lol.
Just buy em
Love this game!
I’ve rlly just been focusing on the side quest so I go out so much I’ve never had a need for em. I haven’t gotten that far in the story but the more stuff u do around the village the more stuff u get from adventures
Well I mean, didn't you know space-time is imploding, I'm playing this game like a doomsday prepper, my loot box is way full
Just buy them
Yep. I buy iron chunks when I should be spending my money on bag space D:
I’m currently praying for snorlax spawns while wandering around grabbing whatever iron I can get so. Yeah. Pretty much.
    Theres an alpha location for snorlax, mofo is always there.
        I MEANT MUNCHLAX but thank u I’ll look for him
            Munchlax is on a mountain in the first or second area, at least 2 of them at a time for me. Just can't remember, snorlax is there too
                The heights camp mountains? I’ve been running around and “resting” to reset spawns for the last two days but none have appeared. I’m not sure what’s up.
                    I wish I could remember. In fact ill look for you right now. I encountered them twice and caught 5 all together. Initially found them because I use deer to get to highest points I can and see what's up there.

Edit: it's in deertrack heights. You're probably searching the right area, however it hasn't spawned yet
                        I LOOKED AROUND AT NIGHTTIME AND FOUND ONE!!!!!! And I caught the alpha across the lake!!!! Ty kind person I just kept trying what you said and it worked!!!
                            Ayeeee I'm sorry it took as long as it did! Gratz on the alpha
Honestly just catch a lot of Pokémon and complete your research tasks. It’s so easy to get money in this game, it’s faster to just focus on catching Pokémon and then buy the iron chunks. Loot them when you see them but I’ve never had issues with money even spending 20k on materials regularly
    Job pays for itself really xD
I usually do a few main stories then i go back to getting ressources and finishing any requests i can then getting more pokemons. Thats my cycle. But yea gotta HAVE THEM all resources while catching them all
TIL, after over 50 hours in, that you could send Pokémon out to the ore deposits and leaf/brush piles - not just the trees.

![gif](giphy|wMvESGxZ0Cqd2)

question (bc I'm headed to bed and haven't tried this yet): can any Pokémon thrown at a smashable rock destroy it? Or do they need to know rock smash? Maybe it's level-locked?

again I'm going to bed now but since the game doesn't seem to - as explicitly - discuss it, I'm curious.

EDIT - I have become exponentially more efficient and now have plenty of supplies thank you!!
    Any Pokemon can be used for any sort of resource gathering.
        This also includes picking things up off the ground. Like honeycombs and the shards in the distortion area.
            WHAT?!
                I realized when I realized I was throwing Pokémon for no reason with the small iron chunks
    There are only a few breakable rocks.
    I’m worse than that… I only just (50hrs in) worked out you could “mass” release what you’ve caught by talking to the NPC but he paddock in the village…
        Also, by the by, you can do this at any place where you can access pasture Pokémon - so even out in the wilds when talking to the Security Corps guy.
            Oh god! Really… ffs. Well now I know…
        That's not toooo bad assuming you hadn't filled your storage yet lol. I wish that you could sort the Pokémon storage by species to see all the dupes in one place.
            Oh yeah… I’ve not really left the first area… maxing out my dex… so yeah… storage is always full. Releasing 1 at a time is a pain. 
And yeah! Why is there no flipping sort for poke-boxes.
                Gotcha! Do you know exactly what the qualifications are for getting the completed symbol next a Pokémon in the dex? Like some of the things have red arrows but even when they aren't full sometimes I still get the completion symbol. But then other times I'll work really hard to max one of the tasks and it won't get me anywhere.
                    I think you just need 10 ticks, so you can complete an entry fairly quickly, catching, defeating… you won’t complete the entry until you cash in the research with the professor.
                        THANK YOU!
Thats the whole game haha. Gotta get those chunks if ya wanna throw down(literally)
So are Pokemon supposed to steal stuff right in front of you because a starly freaking stole an iron chunk and flew away with it before I could even get to it.

Even the birds want them wtf.
It feels weird. It feels like I’m spending tons of time gathering and catching random Pokémon, and collecting supplies, occasionally progressing, but I’m done all the nobles and only like 12 hours in, galaxy rank 8.

The game sadly feels quite bare. I’m having fun, but worried there isn’t enough to have replay value like other Pokémon games.
    It really depends. I think it's quite fun even after I completed the pokedex (also rank 8), but I find myself motivated to complete all the researches to lv10 to get the shiny charm.

Hopefully, though, they'll release a DLC for this game. I'd love more forms, more story and maybe even more battle-related places.
    You're playing the game wrong then. I'm 34 hours in and just got Basculegion. You basically sped run the game and are complaining about lack of content lol

Plenty of pokémon to catch, areas to explore, side missions, research missions, alphast to catch. If you don't enjoy those activities then sadly the game is just not for you man.

I coul've spent way more time on the second area tbh. I just progressed to the third one because I was 20 levels over Lilligant and decided it was time to progress through the story so I'm not THAT overleveled.
        I’m not speedrunning, and I am taking my time in these areas… the galaxy ranking should make that more than clear. Just because my playthrough doesn’t line up exactly with yours it doesn’t mean anyone is playing wrong.
            I mean I'm obviously taking more time than the average player, but you cleared 5 areas in 12 hours? That's like 2 hours per area. You're either speed running or missing out on a ton of content.
                I think I spent about 4-5 hours in the first zone just filling out the Pokédex and catching tons of alphas, before eventually clearing it.

If you haven’t reached them yet, there is a lot less going on in zone 4 and 5, than the other zones. After gaining many mount Pokémon you also get to go around and explore at a significantly increased rate.
    I don't see how you could possibly have done all the nobles and *also* enough side content to get to Level 8 in just 12 hours. What does the actual timer counter on your save file say?
        12:27.
    I feel the same dude, that first and second zone was great but the game get progressively uninteresting to me, i know this will het downvoted to hell but those environments in coronet and coast are some of the most ugly unappealing things ive seen in a game. 

Criticizing a point of a game does not invalidate what you think about said game, I love it but some of it is low effort. It is just true.
        I'll definitely agree that the game feels like it should have more things to discover, although I'm personally still enjoying flying around looking for shinies. I'm well aware this isn't gonna be interesting for everyone. 

Honestly the most interesting thing that I found would have had to be figuring out how to get Manaphy. I think there should be more things like that, not locked behind quests, where you can do some secret things to unlock secret areas or Pokemon. Use rock smash on a specific cave wall, for example, or chuck a specific set of food over some dark shadow in the water to find a Kyogre.

Basically I think that they did well on improving the Pokemon aspect of it, but they need to improve upon their open world for future titles. It's unlikely that I'd enjoy this game as much if it were a brand new franchise with its own unique monsters.
Same
And I need tumblestones
Me but with shinies.
Jug
Opposite for me, I blaze through the story and then catch enough Pokémon to get the next star.
The iron age
I played for 3 days, had 5 stars, and 6 mons at level 50+ before I even went to face Kleaver. Was too busy gathering supplies, exploring the whole map, and finding places to climb up that the game didn't want me to.
man, my team is kinda overleveled, because i keep getting sidetracked with other stuff lol, i just reached the 4th area and my team is between lvl 55-65
    Same but in third level xD
I spent 7 hours looking for eevee. I just beat Kleavor
True, I feel like we as players have to balance story progress with catching Pokemon and overleveling. In Obsidian Fieldlands I already felt OP, I think I will progress the story a bit until it gets a bit more challenging.
guess I'm the only one hunting supplies to crave pokeballs as I only use pokeballs
I always have so many iron chunks but I never have apricorns
How IRONIC
I got chased by a raging Hippodown last night. It came out of nowhere. I love this game.
Me but replace story progress with shinies😂
Ive been needing apricorns more than anything.
I literally spend 5 hours on Saturday and Sunday to grind my way to 7 stars even before defeating the Kricketune alpha boss fight. Now I think I can focus on story
If you’re a completionist, get 100 leeks.
Pokeballs sell for 100 each, buy a handful and save up some iron chunks while questing further it helps grow.  I'm carrying over 700 PB, 600 GB and over 200 UB.
I always had a massive surplus of iron chunks.. only one..?
I'm just pushing for my eighth star so I can unlock a ball. But for that ball I need iron chunks. And do I have enough iron chunks? No. Do I keep going out and scouting for iron chunks? Yes. Do I get distracted by hunting alpha pokes? All the damn time.
My girlfriend spend 4 hours after I got home getting resources, I beat the game a few days ago and she just beat the first "boss" and she has more of some resources than me.
I spent the whole game hunting down all of my iron and then realised how cheap it was just to buy it from the material merchant in Jubilife after I finished it...
My dumbass was throwing away pep up plants not realizing it's used to make potions.
That's why I'm just rich and spend all my money on iron chunks at the village. It's crazy though I feel like I forage a lot for supplies but it's never enough to craft lmao
    I also have the village farm going for the apricorns so I'm thankfully getting stocked
Packs of wild pokemon hunting me down, the screen flashing red, and I'll still hop off the wyrdeer to snag resources
[deleted]
    You have to kill Vespiquen with fire moves. Not have her kill others while using a fire move. So go out there and burn some bees.
After you get a certain amount of stars, you can buy them pretty cheap.
Still on mission 7 but fully evolved my starter and most of the Pokémon I’ve got 😭
oh! you can throw one of your pokemon near it and they will pick it up for you, makes gathering at sea much simpler. this works even with pickups like plants and whatnot. dont know about satchels though.
Why is everyone so obsessed with iron I have way too much I need tumblestones and rank xp
i just gpt rich enough to get all the suplies i neded
Apricorns for me. I'll have 50+ chunks and no apricorns.
It’s me I’m someone
    It's us, we are someone
        Correct comrade.
Every time I told myself to continue with the story I was like "well, couldn't hurt to grab a few more tumblestones and leeks." If I'm in town it's like "but did I talk to THAT NPC?"
    For me it's always "oo new Pokemon, it wouldn't hurt to grind out the Pokedex real quick." Hence why I reached 8 stars before completing the second area.
        Same. The  exploration and side quests can really just suck you in. I reached 4 stars before even completing the 1st area and got to evolve my starter to its 2nd evolution before fighting the 1st boss.
        I'm so close to 8 stars and I'm in the second area as well because of this exact reason.
            Wait are you telling me that I can just talk to fem Cyrus and increase my star and that isn't locked behind story mode like MonHunt?
                Yes
                    well damn my life, I didn't have to spent 1 extra hour last night on the story to get 4\* for ladden ball if I knew this.
            As someone who blasted through the main story, you played the right way. When you get to the end you’ll understand why I’m saying that.
        Almost to the 7th star, and I'm considering entering the second area until after I get it. And it definitely hard to get more points.
            Honestly I played naturally and went with the flow; I’m at 8 stars and grind abit here and there on the 3rd are but seeing as there are two more areas, I would say I’m in a good position, after reaching new areas and catching fighting new Pokémon it’s easier to get more points; granted even for me I’m overleveled, if you havnt changed your team much im sure you are too, even more than me entering area 2
                I just went back and forth between side quests and main story depending on what I wanted to work on. Pretty much got to 8 stars by the 3rd location. Ngl tho I kinda went through the story real quick by that point because I had people try and spoil the story for me so kinda rushed through to avoid it.
                    Damn here I am at 6 stars nearly at the end of the story, maybe I should explore some more.
                        Definitely side tracking is what makes the game fun, exploring hard to reach places or off the way, you’ll encounter Pokémon you wouldn’t if you just went straight with the story
        How in the world, I’m star 2 and I just whooped the shit outta ursuluna
        Me reaching 8 stars and having a level 60 team before I even leave the first area
    Then you look at the time and it's 1 a.m.
Me farming Sky Tumblestones
I do!
Small correction, everyone will spend 10 hours getting supplies
What I'm starting to do is put ¥20,000 or so every once in a while into crafting  materials to lessen the grind a bit.
    Naw all money goes to that DB satchel space
        26 hours in and the only thing I’ve spent money on is storage space
            A little fashion for me. (I look like the riddler) but the rest, sachelssssss
            Buying Pokemon moves were great early on but not necessarily needed. Some just to cover the teams movesets.
                Do you even need to really battle much? I’ve never really found myself needing a good party yet about 4 areas into the game and have just been XP grinding with the spaces. I feel like it’s just faster to throw attempt rather than battle.
                Where do you buy Pokemon moves
                    The trainer (martial arts lady) in the town
            I was the same until I realized that I never crafted in the wild so there was no need to be scammed by Bagins any longer.
            Does anybody know where it ends? Last space I paid 40K for an additional slot and he was still asking me if I wanted to learn more. I’m like bro am I paying for a large hadron collider at this point?
                The last one is a million i believe. Think you spend like 4.2 million in total.
                    This man is about to build the largest mansion in town from selling space.
                        > selling space.



He's a Pearl operative
                            Diamond clan rise up
                            Got ‘m.
            Yup. I'm like 20 hours and literally ONLY buying satchel space so far. There's plenty of resources you can collect for everything. Can't find satchel space in the wild.
        Agreed, satchel space and maybe the occasional move tutor move.
I went from level 10 pokemon to level 30 pokemon just collecting resources... story wise I should only be at a single star.
Makes me feel like I'm playing old school monster hunter
An hour? I spent two days gathering and crafting stuff. This is my jam. I'm in love with this game.
You can buy all the supplies in the village you know. Easy enough to make money with selling star pieces and submitting reports too
    This what I’ve been starting to do. I’ve bought some bag upgrades. But I feel like I need get get a bunch of supples so I can make sure I don’t run out and then not have room in my bag for them. Currently I have 100+ of the first 3 potions. About the same for revives. Currently trying to get enough materials for poke balls. I’m almost rank 8 and only in the 2nd area.
Yes, but then the problem is that you end up catching pokemon while gathering supplies and you end up in the same spot.
I quite literally beat the entire game and completed about 75% of the pokedex before I realized there's a guy in town who sells crafting materials such as iron chunks.
You can never have too many leeks
    Every trip minus farming them I’m down to like 1 revive and 3 leeks. I only return when my mostly expanded bag is full and I’ve got like 1 poke left or 0.
        Save your resources. If you're just out and not focusing on the main story just pop into a camp to heal instead of using your items
            Yea revali’s gale I mean Braviary makes it easier to get back to where I left off. Just put the lil flag marker down before I fast travel sometimes
                ravioli spotted
    *happy Farfetch’d noises*
There’s literally a sidequest that requires 100 of those, and from what I’ve heard, buying them from the caravan doesn’t progress the quest. 

Meaning you have to collect 100 medicinal leeks in the wild and avoid the urge to use them yourself for all that time. 

On the bright side, the intro to the quest is somewhat funny (not spoiling that intro, see it for yourself). (For the record, the nurse lady in the HQ building gives this quest after a while)
    I just bought them and turned them in so that does work.
        I can't find where to buy them!
            Right by your room, the lady on the right sells berries and vegetables. The guy on the right has random deals and sometimes rare items!
                Thank you so much!
                Speaking of the other caravan guy who has random deals, how often does that refresh? I’m currently not very far into the postgame, and I’m hoping I haven’t permanently missed any rare items.
                    Not sure but I'm assuming it's similar to the field where you grow apricorns and mints so probably how many pokemon you've caught.
Me who even lack pokeballs
    same. used them all on buizels
        I caught the Alpha one. Helped me save a lot of time I guess.
            If only we can find this damn alpha and also fuckin cherrim, I’m 3areas in and have not been able to catch either, cherrim was a pain in the ass the first time she appeared so I killed her and now I never see her for the quest
                Buizel is there in region 1. If you want I can give you the location.
                    The alpha buizel is random. Every buizel that spawns has a 2% chance of being alpha (same as every Pokémon) Everytime you refresh the encounter table (you can either catch them all and sleep on camp, or get out and get back into the area, I think)
Is this what they’re using iron chunks for? For the great balls?
I’m planning to complete the entire game with only regular red balls. Doing so has freed up lots of bag space.
    Good luck with that lol
    Ultra balls take the same resources as 2 regular balls + 2 iron. You will definitely use more regular balls than ultra balls to catch the same pokemon. It's just not worth it for 1 bag slot.
    It’s not really that much bag space for a great ball.
[deleted]
    I think it's just you haha  


I normally always throw regular balls, but in this game it's not that easy...
Same loooool

I’ve got like 500+ iron in my storage lmfao
    How on Arceus' green earth did you get that many? I wanna know some good locations.
        I just try not to use Wyrdeer much for travel because I pick less stuff up, and at the same time I don’t craft any balls that need iron chunks lmfao. It’s just around 45~ hours of picking up every chunk I see lmao.

I’ve only been using Pokéballs because of my OCD-ish need for uniformity.
It’s my favorite, by a lot.
Been hunting for alphas. How can you not drop everything when you see one?
    I ignore them because I have no poke balls half the time also I don’t want to die 😭.
        just escape at last mon. You cant fail this game
    Full Pokedex out of alphas, everyone?
I only just got to the second area and am Star Level 6 🥲 I can't help but to perfect the Pokédex entries.
    That's not bad at all! If you complete all of them, not only will you get a higher odds for shiny pokemon - you'll also get a shiny charm for the full research dex!

And most of all, all those pokeball checkmarks look so damn nicely in the pokedex.
        I kinda wish the dex was nicer to scroll through though, a proper grid would be nice (just lore it as an "index" page idk)
        Wait you have to perfect the whole dex for a shiny charm. That's a LOT
            Nah, you don't, you just need research lv10 on all pokemon
                Oh. OP said they are perfecting every entry so I thought you meant that as well.
    I got to 7 before I went to the second area, but then I started thinking... "if I could swim AND fly, this would be a lot easier". 

So I've gotten one of those things so far.
    I'm still area 1 with 6 star so don't worry. I've also had to stop along the way and complete a dex entry as I come across a Mon
    the only thing from keeping me going through the story is online spoilers
Is the bugger still not 2’8? :P
What stage of the game are you at? They become pretty common after the second area.
    [removed]
        That's what I'm loving about this game. I'm 10+ hrs in and just began the Kleavor quest. I spent 3hrs last night finding a munchlax, leveling it up, evolving it, and just exploring. Feels like what pokemon should have been from the beginning.
            I cannot find a munchlax!!! Any tips??
                Go to the obsidian area and catch/defeat the bug pokemon around. They share the same spawns. You can go to the hilltop camp to rest to reset the spawns. Probably took around 30-45min to get it. Then I found two!
                    I was grabbing a drink and one ran up to me I tried to run away and it followed me and I caught it, are they rare?
        Oh, you’re still in the first area then.
            [removed]
                I've spent 8 hours grinding out ideal nature Pokemon, trying to get Dustox or even a Cascoon has been a struggle because they all want to evolve into Silcoon. I know I should progress the story, I know I should move on so that time isn't stopped on the first afternoon, but I cant bring myself to do so.

I've collected 600 apricorns in my storage so far.
                    You can use mints to change natures
                        Ah, thank you, I thought they might be in it somewhere. I find it more rewarding to catch them with the right nature but if it starts getting boring I'll keep it in mind and just move on.
                By the third area every rock generally will give at least 1 iron chunk multiple from iron rocks
                It’s a lie. I’m in the fourth area. Iron chunks are still in short supply
                    Uhmmm go back to area 2. Don't deny things you can't see.
                        yup just finished Kleavor got the great ball recipe finally. like a freaking tool i didn’t realize i was throwing feather balls for almost the entire area. Wondering why i couldn’t catch shit.
                            But those are great. I usually use them.
                                not when you’re trying to catch Hippopotas
                    Use the second mount for finding stuff.

I assure you, you'll probably end up using the mount for looking for evolution stones.

You will not find evolution stones. You will find dozens of iron chunks.
        There is a cave around the far eastern part of the map that has several iron nodes to farm. I still haven't left the 1st area, so running that cave has stocked my GreatBall needs.
            Yes, you can fast travel to grand arena and go there. Reset and do again if you're lazy.
            [removed]
                There's lots of machop in the area just so you know you're headed the right direction
Tons of them in shake rocks with geodudes if you knock them out you'll get like 10 or so if its iron chunks.  The second area is more full of them than the first.

Edit. Higher the star rank, higher the rewards from harvesting resources. Miniscule but it stacks.
Tbh I’ve started just buying the materials as I need more balls. I have so much money from expeditions it’s barely anything, and I still have plenty left for bag upgrades. I still collect materials while out, but I’m catching faster than I’m finding a lot of the time.
    Ahhahaa wait til you encounter a mass breakout you use a slot of balls on
Ultras take twice as much iron. Happy hunting!
Where’d you buy them??
    There’s a shop/guy in the main section of the village that sells recipes and materials!
        Aka the dude you build the dolls for, he’s got the only crafting station I can find. Stash? Next to door. Crafting station? 1/2 mile away lol
            [deleted]
                Yep. You also don't need to transfer items from the bottomless box to your inventory if you use the stationary crafting stations, as those use items from both your box and satchel
Make it a habit to punch every single tree you see and you'll have more than you could ever need in no time. The only thing I find myself needing more of are sky tumblestones and iron chunks.
    I've intentionally punched every Apricorn tree I've seen (going out of my way), spent blocks of time just running around grinding them, and my farm is perpetually producing Apricorns. I can never keep up. Sky Tumblestones and Iron Chunks are often low supply but Apricorns are the major scarcity for me.

Maybe it has a lot to do with individual catching style. How many balls you're throwing out, which ones you choose to use more frequently.
        Yeah maybe that's it. I play stealthily most of the time so I rarely need more than one ball per Pokémon. I just started practicing with feather balls so maybe I'm short on those because my aim isn't the best with those yet lol
            Do you know if they white flying pokemon in the first area thats kinda way up is catchall with featherballs? I tried to hit him so many times but no luck.
    See I have a couple thousand of each of those lol. I need the medicine stalks and poke ball nuts. (I still can’t remember the actual names lol)
        Apricorns! And you should try farming them in the town if you aren’t already, that’s helpful
Edited a word
    how do u punch?
        I meant send your pokemon
            oh, i thought u can personally punch the tree
    Going after my dex I always keep a low level new Mon in my team to throw at trees and rocks and level it up
I prefer the punching trees method below. I just got everything all the time with Pokémon to get a little exp and item farm. But you an also grow apricorns shhhh
Ask the farmer in town to grow you an apricorn harvest!
I think you can buy evolution stones from the lady to the left of the galaxy building. She’s at a stall.
    Well, yes, but I also had to buy other evo items from her, so I couldnt really afford the stones.
        Ah alright. Yeah, that currency is hard to come by.
        What stones you looking for? I can see if I have them tomorrow if you still need. I know I have a few of the thunder water and fire, and probably one of each other one
I need to use poison powder 40 times for 6 different mons.
    Damn.
    [deleted]
        Im not sure if theres a reward for a finished Perfect dex besides extra shiny rolls, but a finished Complete dex (level 10 everything) gives the shiny charm
            [deleted]
                Its hard to explain but heres a picture thatll help https://ibb.co/jG1Z6Tb
I wish you could throw your pokemon out at trees while mounted though
after you get the water mount it auto switches mounts for you, so if you jump into the water it hot-swaps
You can just buy them from the crafting guy, I think either after you get to the second or third map.
Theres an alpha location for snorlax, mofo is always there.
    I MEANT MUNCHLAX but thank u I’ll look for him
        Munchlax is on a mountain in the first or second area, at least 2 of them at a time for me. Just can't remember, snorlax is there too
            The heights camp mountains? I’ve been running around and “resting” to reset spawns for the last two days but none have appeared. I’m not sure what’s up.
                I wish I could remember. In fact ill look for you right now. I encountered them twice and caught 5 all together. Initially found them because I use deer to get to highest points I can and see what's up there.

Edit: it's in deertrack heights. You're probably searching the right area, however it hasn't spawned yet
                    I LOOKED AROUND AT NIGHTTIME AND FOUND ONE!!!!!! And I caught the alpha across the lake!!!! Ty kind person I just kept trying what you said and it worked!!!
                        Ayeeee I'm sorry it took as long as it did! Gratz on the alpha
Job pays for itself really xD
Any Pokemon can be used for any sort of resource gathering.
    This also includes picking things up off the ground. Like honeycombs and the shards in the distortion area.
        WHAT?!
            I realized when I realized I was throwing Pokémon for no reason with the small iron chunks
There are only a few breakable rocks.
I’m worse than that… I only just (50hrs in) worked out you could “mass” release what you’ve caught by talking to the NPC but he paddock in the village…
    Also, by the by, you can do this at any place where you can access pasture Pokémon - so even out in the wilds when talking to the Security Corps guy.
        Oh god! Really… ffs. Well now I know…
    That's not toooo bad assuming you hadn't filled your storage yet lol. I wish that you could sort the Pokémon storage by species to see all the dupes in one place.
        Oh yeah… I’ve not really left the first area… maxing out my dex… so yeah… storage is always full. Releasing 1 at a time is a pain. 
And yeah! Why is there no flipping sort for poke-boxes.
            Gotcha! Do you know exactly what the qualifications are for getting the completed symbol next a Pokémon in the dex? Like some of the things have red arrows but even when they aren't full sometimes I still get the completion symbol. But then other times I'll work really hard to max one of the tasks and it won't get me anywhere.
                I think you just need 10 ticks, so you can complete an entry fairly quickly, catching, defeating… you won’t complete the entry until you cash in the research with the professor.
                    THANK YOU!
It really depends. I think it's quite fun even after I completed the pokedex (also rank 8), but I find myself motivated to complete all the researches to lv10 to get the shiny charm.

Hopefully, though, they'll release a DLC for this game. I'd love more forms, more story and maybe even more battle-related places.
You're playing the game wrong then. I'm 34 hours in and just got Basculegion. You basically sped run the game and are complaining about lack of content lol

Plenty of pokémon to catch, areas to explore, side missions, research missions, alphast to catch. If you don't enjoy those activities then sadly the game is just not for you man.

I coul've spent way more time on the second area tbh. I just progressed to the third one because I was 20 levels over Lilligant and decided it was time to progress through the story so I'm not THAT overleveled.
    I’m not speedrunning, and I am taking my time in these areas… the galaxy ranking should make that more than clear. Just because my playthrough doesn’t line up exactly with yours it doesn’t mean anyone is playing wrong.
        I mean I'm obviously taking more time than the average player, but you cleared 5 areas in 12 hours? That's like 2 hours per area. You're either speed running or missing out on a ton of content.
            I think I spent about 4-5 hours in the first zone just filling out the Pokédex and catching tons of alphas, before eventually clearing it.

If you haven’t reached them yet, there is a lot less going on in zone 4 and 5, than the other zones. After gaining many mount Pokémon you also get to go around and explore at a significantly increased rate.
I don't see how you could possibly have done all the nobles and *also* enough side content to get to Level 8 in just 12 hours. What does the actual timer counter on your save file say?

I feel the same dude, that first and second zone was great but the game get progressively uninteresting to me, i know this will het downvoted to hell but those environments in coronet and coast are some of the most ugly unappealing things ive seen in a game. 

Criticizing a point of a game does not invalidate what you think about said game, I love it but some of it is low effort. It is just true.
    I'll definitely agree that the game feels like it should have more things to discover, although I'm personally still enjoying flying around looking for shinies. I'm well aware this isn't gonna be interesting for everyone. 

Honestly the most interesting thing that I found would have had to be figuring out how to get Manaphy. I think there should be more things like that, not locked behind quests, where you can do some secret things to unlock secret areas or Pokemon. Use rock smash on a specific cave wall, for example, or chuck a specific set of food over some dark shadow in the water to find a Kyogre.

Basically I think that they did well on improving the Pokemon aspect of it, but they need to improve upon their open world for future titles. It's unlikely that I'd enjoy this game as much if it were a brand new franchise with its own unique monsters.
Same but in third level xD
I also have the village farm going for the apricorns so I'm thankfully getting stocked
You have to kill Vespiquen with fire moves. Not have her kill others while using a fire move. So go out there and burn some bees.
It's us, we are someone
    Correct comrade.
For me it's always "oo new Pokemon, it wouldn't hurt to grind out the Pokedex real quick." Hence why I reached 8 stars before completing the second area.
    Same. The  exploration and side quests can really just suck you in. I reached 4 stars before even completing the 1st area and got to evolve my starter to its 2nd evolution before fighting the 1st boss.
    I'm so close to 8 stars and I'm in the second area as well because of this exact reason.
        Wait are you telling me that I can just talk to fem Cyrus and increase my star and that isn't locked behind story mode like MonHunt?
            Yes
                well damn my life, I didn't have to spent 1 extra hour last night on the story to get 4\* for ladden ball if I knew this.
        As someone who blasted through the main story, you played the right way. When you get to the end you’ll understand why I’m saying that.
    Almost to the 7th star, and I'm considering entering the second area until after I get it. And it definitely hard to get more points.
        Honestly I played naturally and went with the flow; I’m at 8 stars and grind abit here and there on the 3rd are but seeing as there are two more areas, I would say I’m in a good position, after reaching new areas and catching fighting new Pokémon it’s easier to get more points; granted even for me I’m overleveled, if you havnt changed your team much im sure you are too, even more than me entering area 2
            I just went back and forth between side quests and main story depending on what I wanted to work on. Pretty much got to 8 stars by the 3rd location. Ngl tho I kinda went through the story real quick by that point because I had people try and spoil the story for me so kinda rushed through to avoid it.
                Damn here I am at 6 stars nearly at the end of the story, maybe I should explore some more.
                    Definitely side tracking is what makes the game fun, exploring hard to reach places or off the way, you’ll encounter Pokémon you wouldn’t if you just went straight with the story
    How in the world, I’m star 2 and I just whooped the shit outta ursuluna
    Me reaching 8 stars and having a level 60 team before I even leave the first area
Then you look at the time and it's 1 a.m.
Naw all money goes to that DB satchel space
    26 hours in and the only thing I’ve spent money on is storage space
        A little fashion for me. (I look like the riddler) but the rest, sachelssssss
        Buying Pokemon moves were great early on but not necessarily needed. Some just to cover the teams movesets.
            Do you even need to really battle much? I’ve never really found myself needing a good party yet about 4 areas into the game and have just been XP grinding with the spaces. I feel like it’s just faster to throw attempt rather than battle.
            Where do you buy Pokemon moves
                The trainer (martial arts lady) in the town
        I was the same until I realized that I never crafted in the wild so there was no need to be scammed by Bagins any longer.
        Does anybody know where it ends? Last space I paid 40K for an additional slot and he was still asking me if I wanted to learn more. I’m like bro am I paying for a large hadron collider at this point?
            The last one is a million i believe. Think you spend like 4.2 million in total.
                This man is about to build the largest mansion in town from selling space.
                    > selling space.



He's a Pearl operative
                        Diamond clan rise up
                        Got ‘m.
        Yup. I'm like 20 hours and literally ONLY buying satchel space so far. There's plenty of resources you can collect for everything. Can't find satchel space in the wild.
    Agreed, satchel space and maybe the occasional move tutor move.
This what I’ve been starting to do. I’ve bought some bag upgrades. But I feel like I need get get a bunch of supples so I can make sure I don’t run out and then not have room in my bag for them. Currently I have 100+ of the first 3 potions. About the same for revives. Currently trying to get enough materials for poke balls. I’m almost rank 8 and only in the 2nd area.
Every trip minus farming them I’m down to like 1 revive and 3 leeks. I only return when my mostly expanded bag is full and I’ve got like 1 poke left or 0.
    Save your resources. If you're just out and not focusing on the main story just pop into a camp to heal instead of using your items
        Yea revali’s gale I mean Braviary makes it easier to get back to where I left off. Just put the lil flag marker down before I fast travel sometimes
            ravioli spotted
*happy Farfetch’d noises*
I just bought them and turned them in so that does work.
    I can't find where to buy them!
        Right by your room, the lady on the right sells berries and vegetables. The guy on the right has random deals and sometimes rare items!
            Thank you so much!
            Speaking of the other caravan guy who has random deals, how often does that refresh? I’m currently not very far into the postgame, and I’m hoping I haven’t permanently missed any rare items.
                Not sure but I'm assuming it's similar to the field where you grow apricorns and mints so probably how many pokemon you've caught.
same. used them all on buizels
    I caught the Alpha one. Helped me save a lot of time I guess.
        If only we can find this damn alpha and also fuckin cherrim, I’m 3areas in and have not been able to catch either, cherrim was a pain in the ass the first time she appeared so I killed her and now I never see her for the quest
            Buizel is there in region 1. If you want I can give you the location.
                The alpha buizel is random. Every buizel that spawns has a 2% chance of being alpha (same as every Pokémon) Everytime you refresh the encounter table (you can either catch them all and sleep on camp, or get out and get back into the area, I think)
Good luck with that lol
Ultra balls take the same resources as 2 regular balls + 2 iron. You will definitely use more regular balls than ultra balls to catch the same pokemon. It's just not worth it for 1 bag slot.
It’s not really that much bag space for a great ball.
I think it's just you haha  


I normally always throw regular balls, but in this game it's not that easy...
How on Arceus' green earth did you get that many? I wanna know some good locations.
    I just try not to use Wyrdeer much for travel because I pick less stuff up, and at the same time I don’t craft any balls that need iron chunks lmfao. It’s just around 45~ hours of picking up every chunk I see lmao.

I’ve only been using Pokéballs because of my OCD-ish need for uniformity.
I ignore them because I have no poke balls half the time also I don’t want to die 😭.
    just escape at last mon. You cant fail this game
Full Pokedex out of alphas, everyone?
That's not bad at all! If you complete all of them, not only will you get a higher odds for shiny pokemon - you'll also get a shiny charm for the full research dex!

And most of all, all those pokeball checkmarks look so damn nicely in the pokedex.
    I kinda wish the dex was nicer to scroll through though, a proper grid would be nice (just lore it as an "index" page idk)
    Wait you have to perfect the whole dex for a shiny charm. That's a LOT
        Nah, you don't, you just need research lv10 on all pokemon
            Oh. OP said they are perfecting every entry so I thought you meant that as well.
I got to 7 before I went to the second area, but then I started thinking... "if I could swim AND fly, this would be a lot easier". 

So I've gotten one of those things so far.
I'm still area 1 with 6 star so don't worry. I've also had to stop along the way and complete a dex entry as I come across a Mon
the only thing from keeping me going through the story is online spoilers
[removed]
    That's what I'm loving about this game. I'm 10+ hrs in and just began the Kleavor quest. I spent 3hrs last night finding a munchlax, leveling it up, evolving it, and just exploring. Feels like what pokemon should have been from the beginning.
        I cannot find a munchlax!!! Any tips??
            Go to the obsidian area and catch/defeat the bug pokemon around. They share the same spawns. You can go to the hilltop camp to rest to reset the spawns. Probably took around 30-45min to get it. Then I found two!
                I was grabbing a drink and one ran up to me I tried to run away and it followed me and I caught it, are they rare?
    Oh, you’re still in the first area then.
        [removed]
            I've spent 8 hours grinding out ideal nature Pokemon, trying to get Dustox or even a Cascoon has been a struggle because they all want to evolve into Silcoon. I know I should progress the story, I know I should move on so that time isn't stopped on the first afternoon, but I cant bring myself to do so.

I've collected 600 apricorns in my storage so far.
                You can use mints to change natures
                    Ah, thank you, I thought they might be in it somewhere. I find it more rewarding to catch them with the right nature but if it starts getting boring I'll keep it in mind and just move on.
            By the third area every rock generally will give at least 1 iron chunk multiple from iron rocks
            It’s a lie. I’m in the fourth area. Iron chunks are still in short supply
                Uhmmm go back to area 2. Don't deny things you can't see.
                    yup just finished Kleavor got the great ball recipe finally. like a freaking tool i didn’t realize i was throwing feather balls for almost the entire area. Wondering why i couldn’t catch shit.
                        But those are great. I usually use them.
                            not when you’re trying to catch Hippopotas
                Use the second mount for finding stuff.

I assure you, you'll probably end up using the mount for looking for evolution stones.

You will not find evolution stones. You will find dozens of iron chunks.
    There is a cave around the far eastern part of the map that has several iron nodes to farm. I still haven't left the 1st area, so running that cave has stocked my GreatBall needs.
        Yes, you can fast travel to grand arena and go there. Reset and do again if you're lazy.
        [removed]
            There's lots of machop in the area just so you know you're headed the right direction
Ahhahaa wait til you encounter a mass breakout you use a slot of balls on
There’s a shop/guy in the main section of the village that sells recipes and materials!
    Aka the dude you build the dolls for, he’s got the only crafting station I can find. Stash? Next to door. Crafting station? 1/2 mile away lol
        [deleted]
            Yep. You also don't need to transfer items from the bottomless box to your inventory if you use the stationary crafting stations, as those use items from both your box and satchel
I've intentionally punched every Apricorn tree I've seen (going out of my way), spent blocks of time just running around grinding them, and my farm is perpetually producing Apricorns. I can never keep up. Sky Tumblestones and Iron Chunks are often low supply but Apricorns are the major scarcity for me.

Maybe it has a lot to do with individual catching style. How many balls you're throwing out, which ones you choose to use more frequently.
    Yeah maybe that's it. I play stealthily most of the time so I rarely need more than one ball per Pokémon. I just started practicing with feather balls so maybe I'm short on those because my aim isn't the best with those yet lol
        Do you know if they white flying pokemon in the first area thats kinda way up is catchall with featherballs? I tried to hit him so many times but no luck.
See I have a couple thousand of each of those lol. I need the medicine stalks and poke ball nuts. (I still can’t remember the actual names lol)
    Apricorns! And you should try farming them in the town if you aren’t already, that’s helpful
Edited a word
how do u punch?
    I meant send your pokemon
        oh, i thought u can personally punch the tree
Going after my dex I always keep a low level new Mon in my team to throw at trees and rocks and level it up
Well, yes, but I also had to buy other evo items from her, so I couldnt really afford the stones.
    Ah alright. Yeah, that currency is hard to come by.
    What stones you looking for? I can see if I have them tomorrow if you still need. I know I have a few of the thunder water and fire, and probably one of each other one
Damn.

    Im not sure if theres a reward for a finished Perfect dex besides extra shiny rolls, but a finished Complete dex (level 10 everything) gives the shiny charm

I MEANT MUNCHLAX but thank u I’ll look for him
    Munchlax is on a mountain in the first or second area, at least 2 of them at a time for me. Just can't remember, snorlax is there too
        The heights camp mountains? I’ve been running around and “resting” to reset spawns for the last two days but none have appeared. I’m not sure what’s up.
            I wish I could remember. In fact ill look for you right now. I encountered them twice and caught 5 all together. Initially found them because I use deer to get to highest points I can and see what's up there.

Edit: it's in deertrack heights. You're probably searching the right area, however it hasn't spawned yet
                I LOOKED AROUND AT NIGHTTIME AND FOUND ONE!!!!!! And I caught the alpha across the lake!!!! Ty kind person I just kept trying what you said and it worked!!!
                    Ayeeee I'm sorry it took as long as it did! Gratz on the alpha
This also includes picking things up off the ground. Like honeycombs and the shards in the distortion area.
    WHAT?!
        I realized when I realized I was throwing Pokémon for no reason with the small iron chunks
Also, by the by, you can do this at any place where you can access pasture Pokémon - so even out in the wilds when talking to the Security Corps guy.
    Oh god! Really… ffs. Well now I know…
That's not toooo bad assuming you hadn't filled your storage yet lol. I wish that you could sort the Pokémon storage by species to see all the dupes in one place.
    Oh yeah… I’ve not really left the first area… maxing out my dex… so yeah… storage is always full. Releasing 1 at a time is a pain. 
And yeah! Why is there no flipping sort for poke-boxes.
        Gotcha! Do you know exactly what the qualifications are for getting the completed symbol next a Pokémon in the dex? Like some of the things have red arrows but even when they aren't full sometimes I still get the completion symbol. But then other times I'll work really hard to max one of the tasks and it won't get me anywhere.
            I think you just need 10 ticks, so you can complete an entry fairly quickly, catching, defeating… you won’t complete the entry until you cash in the research with the professor.
                THANK YOU!
I’m not speedrunning, and I am taking my time in these areas… the galaxy ranking should make that more than clear. Just because my playthrough doesn’t line up exactly with yours it doesn’t mean anyone is playing wrong.
    I mean I'm obviously taking more time than the average player, but you cleared 5 areas in 12 hours? That's like 2 hours per area. You're either speed running or missing out on a ton of content.
        I think I spent about 4-5 hours in the first zone just filling out the Pokédex and catching tons of alphas, before eventually clearing it.

If you haven’t reached them yet, there is a lot less going on in zone 4 and 5, than the other zones. After gaining many mount Pokémon you also get to go around and explore at a significantly increased rate.

    The heights camp mountains? I’ve been running around and “resting” to reset spawns for the last two days but none have appeared. I’m not sure what’s up.
        I wish I could remember. In fact ill look for you right now. I encountered them twice and caught 5 all together. Initially found them because I use deer to get to highest points I can and see what's up there.

Edit: it's in deertrack heights. You're probably searching the right area, however it hasn't spawned yet
            I LOOKED AROUND AT NIGHTTIME AND FOUND ONE!!!!!! And I caught the alpha across the lake!!!! Ty kind person I just kept trying what you said and it worked!!!
                Ayeeee I'm sorry it took as long as it did! Gratz on the alpha
WHAT?!
    I realized when I realized I was throwing Pokémon for no reason with the small iron chunks
Oh god! Really… ffs. Well now I know…
Oh yeah… I’ve not really left the first area… maxing out my dex… so yeah… storage is always full. Releasing 1 at a time is a pain. 
And yeah! Why is there no flipping sort for poke-boxes.
    Gotcha! Do you know exactly what the qualifications are for getting the completed symbol next a Pokémon in the dex? Like some of the things have red arrows but even when they aren't full sometimes I still get the completion symbol. But then other times I'll work really hard to max one of the tasks and it won't get me anywhere.
        I think you just need 10 ticks, so you can complete an entry fairly quickly, catching, defeating… you won’t complete the entry until you cash in the research with the professor.
            THANK YOU!
I mean I'm obviously taking more time than the average player, but you cleared 5 areas in 12 hours? That's like 2 hours per area. You're either speed running or missing out on a ton of content.
    I think I spent about 4-5 hours in the first zone just filling out the Pokédex and catching tons of alphas, before eventually clearing it.

If you haven’t reached them yet, there is a lot less going on in zone 4 and 5, than the other zones. After gaining many mount Pokémon you also get to go around and explore at a significantly increased rate.
Wait are you telling me that I can just talk to fem Cyrus and increase my star and that isn't locked behind story mode like MonHunt?
    Yes
        well damn my life, I didn't have to spent 1 extra hour last night on the story to get 4\* for ladden ball if I knew this.
As someone who blasted through the main story, you played the right way. When you get to the end you’ll understand why I’m saying that.
Honestly I played naturally and went with the flow; I’m at 8 stars and grind abit here and there on the 3rd are but seeing as there are two more areas, I would say I’m in a good position, after reaching new areas and catching fighting new Pokémon it’s easier to get more points; granted even for me I’m overleveled, if you havnt changed your team much im sure you are too, even more than me entering area 2
    I just went back and forth between side quests and main story depending on what I wanted to work on. Pretty much got to 8 stars by the 3rd location. Ngl tho I kinda went through the story real quick by that point because I had people try and spoil the story for me so kinda rushed through to avoid it.
        Damn here I am at 6 stars nearly at the end of the story, maybe I should explore some more.
            Definitely side tracking is what makes the game fun, exploring hard to reach places or off the way, you’ll encounter Pokémon you wouldn’t if you just went straight with the story
A little fashion for me. (I look like the riddler) but the rest, sachelssssss
Buying Pokemon moves were great early on but not necessarily needed. Some just to cover the teams movesets.
    Do you even need to really battle much? I’ve never really found myself needing a good party yet about 4 areas into the game and have just been XP grinding with the spaces. I feel like it’s just faster to throw attempt rather than battle.
    Where do you buy Pokemon moves
        The trainer (martial arts lady) in the town
I was the same until I realized that I never crafted in the wild so there was no need to be scammed by Bagins any longer.
Does anybody know where it ends? Last space I paid 40K for an additional slot and he was still asking me if I wanted to learn more. I’m like bro am I paying for a large hadron collider at this point?
    The last one is a million i believe. Think you spend like 4.2 million in total.
        This man is about to build the largest mansion in town from selling space.

Yup. I'm like 20 hours and literally ONLY buying satchel space so far. There's plenty of resources you can collect for everything. Can't find satchel space in the wild.
Yea revali’s gale I mean Braviary makes it easier to get back to where I left off. Just put the lil flag marker down before I fast travel sometimes

Right by your room, the lady on the right sells berries and vegetables. The guy on the right has random deals and sometimes rare items!
    Thank you so much!
    Speaking of the other caravan guy who has random deals, how often does that refresh? I’m currently not very far into the postgame, and I’m hoping I haven’t permanently missed any rare items.
        Not sure but I'm assuming it's similar to the field where you grow apricorns and mints so probably how many pokemon you've caught.
If only we can find this damn alpha and also fuckin cherrim, I’m 3areas in and have not been able to catch either, cherrim was a pain in the ass the first time she appeared so I killed her and now I never see her for the quest
    Buizel is there in region 1. If you want I can give you the location.
        The alpha buizel is random. Every buizel that spawns has a 2% chance of being alpha (same as every Pokémon) Everytime you refresh the encounter table (you can either catch them all and sleep on camp, or get out and get back into the area, I think)
Nah, you don't, you just need research lv10 on all pokemon
    Oh. OP said they are perfecting every entry so I thought you meant that as well.
I cannot find a munchlax!!! Any tips??
    Go to the obsidian area and catch/defeat the bug pokemon around. They share the same spawns. You can go to the hilltop camp to rest to reset the spawns. Probably took around 30-45min to get it. Then I found two!
        I was grabbing a drink and one ran up to me I tried to run away and it followed me and I caught it, are they rare?

    I've spent 8 hours grinding out ideal nature Pokemon, trying to get Dustox or even a Cascoon has been a struggle because they all want to evolve into Silcoon. I know I should progress the story, I know I should move on so that time isn't stopped on the first afternoon, but I cant bring myself to do so.

I've collected 600 apricorns in my storage so far.
        You can use mints to change natures
            Ah, thank you, I thought they might be in it somewhere. I find it more rewarding to catch them with the right nature but if it starts getting boring I'll keep it in mind and just move on.
    By the third area every rock generally will give at least 1 iron chunk multiple from iron rocks
    It’s a lie. I’m in the fourth area. Iron chunks are still in short supply
        Uhmmm go back to area 2. Don't deny things you can't see.
            yup just finished Kleavor got the great ball recipe finally. like a freaking tool i didn’t realize i was throwing feather balls for almost the entire area. Wondering why i couldn’t catch shit.
                But those are great. I usually use them.
                    not when you’re trying to catch Hippopotas
        Use the second mount for finding stuff.

I assure you, you'll probably end up using the mount for looking for evolution stones.

You will not find evolution stones. You will find dozens of iron chunks.
Yes, you can fast travel to grand arena and go there. Reset and do again if you're lazy.

    There's lots of machop in the area just so you know you're headed the right direction
[deleted]
    Yep. You also don't need to transfer items from the bottomless box to your inventory if you use the stationary crafting stations, as those use items from both your box and satchel
Do you know if they white flying pokemon in the first area thats kinda way up is catchall with featherballs? I tried to hit him so many times but no luck.
oh, i thought u can personally punch the tree
