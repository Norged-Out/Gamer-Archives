[[How hard is Volo]]


I was 15 levels ahead of him by the time I got to Temple of Sinnoh to face him so he didn't give me any challenge, so what are your standings on his difficulty?


Hard by pokemon standards a yawn fest by any harder games standards.
    Pretty perfect way to describe it
        Yeah I walked into him not spoilered at a party of 4 lvl 65 mons and 2 guys I was using to fill out their dexs. I lost but changed out the 2 and won handedly no issue. Even made it to the final phase the first time.
I mean I spent a lot of time catching mons and generally just messing about with everything else before I even bothered to face Volo so my team was like 85+ and Max EV so I only had to use my Cresselia and Dialga for the full battle plus Giratina and Giratina v2 lol.  I can imagine a lot of people who rushed through would find this particularly difficult because of the no healing between fights so I would say its down to the individual experience and there's no right or wrong way
Got my butt handed to me about 5 times b4 taking him down.
Not very but he likes it when you talk dirty
SO. FUCKING. HARD.
I was pretty close in level and soloâ€™d his entire team with a Gliscor. Seemed pretty easy to me
Definitely the hardest fight of the series. Though he can be dealt with significantly easier if you just cheese the fight like you did by overleveling / using items in battle etc. 

There are some really tough fights throughout the series if you play with Nuzlocke rules, especially some of the gym leaders in B/W. Even if you just don't follow the death rule, not overleveling Pokemon and using items in battle can make the games have some challenging fights and need actual thought put into teams.
    I would still rank battling Red at the top of Mt. Silver (Gen 2 and HG/SS) as the most challenging and thrilling battle of the series; he would have spanked Volo imo.
        For me it would be Ultra Necrozma in USUM. I had no idea it was coming and despite being in level parity had absolutely no counters. I lost a lot of times before I just barely managed to win.
            Necrozma was fun. I gave up fighting normally and just decided to use Toxic and just stall the way to victory
    I actually ruled that I wouldn't use items in battle so he made half of them faint so it definitely wasn't messing around. Against Giratinas though I took that rule out and used revives
if you go there blind, no over leveling, no stat boosting, it is hell.  I never had so much fun losing. then I had enough frustrations so I overlevelled a bit and had to train a monster clefable then it became too easy.
As hard as a priest at a playground
By pokemon games standards, pretty hard. But thatâ€™s not saying much
I didnt want to use legendaries or items and really just mons I like. Was pretty hard and had to overlevel his by a lot. Chansey farming helped. 

I was using Arcanine, chimecho, raichu, samurott, roserade, basculegion. 

Definitely the hardest pokemon boss. Especially if you didnt want to use legendaries. Cresselia would have helped a ton and the origin bros too.
    I kept losing a couple of times so I was like fuck it, have a taste of my Palkia, Dialga, Cressalia, Heatran Darkrai and Regigigas you winged beast
If you had any doubts about him being Cynthia's ancestor before, the battle against him will clear them up for you real quick.
    Yeah. Five of her mons as Milotic isn't in the game and fascination with legends. And a fucking Satan himself too!
        Do we know why Milotic didn't make it in?  Seems weird
Stronger than you standard champion/final boss for PokÃ©mon. Big issue is 8 PokÃ©mon in total with giratina. If you are over leveled and come in with legendaries or have been properly ev/iv training/hunting he isnâ€™t that bad.
Rock
Hard battles in pokemon always depend on how much you grind, same goes for most rpgs. Like I found Cynthia to be incredibly hard in my recent Platinum playthrough, but my highest levelled mon was like, lvl 58 and Cynthiaâ€™s Garchomp was 68 I believe. So of course I struggled. Voloâ€™s the same. If youâ€™re about equal in levels, the fight is challenging, if youâ€™re underlevelled, itâ€™s genuinely hard. PokÃ©mon games arenâ€™t meant to be very hard by design, but you can make it harder on yourself. Whether it be staying purposefully underlevelled (harder to do in games past gen 6 other than Arceus) or doing a Nuzlocke run, or a no items in battle run, or a monotype run, there are ways to make the games more challenging. So short answer is : Yes and no, it depends entirely on you.
    That ain't right as [Cynthia is 62](https://www.serebii.net/platinum/elitefour.shtml) at her highest in platinum. Are you sure you aren't mixing up bdsp?
        Maybe, but my point of being severely underlevelled stands
Have a group of lvl 80 pokemon and you should be good I used the 3 starters and the 2 legends and beat him easily
    Plus a level 1 cleffa for maximum disrespect?
Not hard but gave me some work
I didnâ€™t lose to anyone the entire game and it actually took me several attempts to beat him + Giratina
Over level.. thatâ€™s what I did.
I was in the same levels as him and had to switch out my team/grit their defense up/and lvl them up a little to beat him
Just get some good mons + Cressila with ice fang. Cressila carried me through almost all of the girantina fight/s
    Cresselia learns Ice Fang?!
        Not naturally, with the combat master lady you can learn it. Itâ€™s super effective against most of Voloâ€™s mon and girantina
            Still, Ice Fang on a tender PokÃ©mon like her
                Idk, but itâ€™s super helpful
Not that hard but I was really high level. I found it harder to quell the noble PokÃ©mon. Dodging their attacks while throwing balms and waiting for the right moment to send in a PokÃ©mon took a lot of coordination and patience.
I was a few levels beneath him, so I lost to giratina, then I just bumped my umbreon to his level and won second try. Heâ€™s not that hard, but the fight is difficult enough to want some preparation, so kinda difficult by PokÃ©mon standards.
If you have maxed out grit stats you should be good.  My Ursaluna took out 5 members of his team with max stats.
First try I beat him BUT he was hard though
Heâ€™s definitely a difficulty spike. My second play through I beat him with just my decidueye for the challenge. I wouldnâ€™t say overleveling helps lots, but you need to play carefully either way.
I wasn't expecting anything like that but if I did it again I could take him out with no issue.
I was around his level and a bit lower and destroyed him. I had a female basculegion with a modest nature and one shot giratina in its first phase. Took a bit more for the second phase but I had overquil, zoroark, and a speed raising nature typhlosion. On top of that my kleavor and lilligant swept the rest of his mons.
I found him quite difficult the first time, because I was not ready for the later stages of tha tbattle at all and I purposefully kept my team from being too high level. But if you use grit items past level 6 and stay at about lvl 60 then he is pretty easy to beat.
I wouldn't put Volo up with the likes of Blue (Gen 1), Red (Gen 2 post-game, top of Mt. Silver), or Cynthia (Gen 4).

That said, definitely the hardest match of the game and far more difficult than any fight in Sw/Sh or S/V imo, and if you don't go in properly leveled you're likely gonna have a bad time.
No legends, no items during battle, a little under leveled. I failed it 4 times
If you are over leveled ( Iâ€™d say +10 levels in this game is over leveled) you are going to beat it easy. But in terms of PokÃ©mon, a pretty hard final boss. Took me 3 tries if I remember correctly using my team. I think my starter and my lilligant was like 5 to 6 levels above him and the rest of the PokÃ©mon were par. I donâ€™t like to over level too much if I can help it just because it makes stuff too easy.
You have to have the right strategy, you canâ€™t just trash him with any PokÃ©mon(unless they are overlevelled, which if u arenâ€™t actively training them they prob wonâ€™t be) You canâ€™t rely on ur legendary dragons bc giritina always attacks first and it seems whenever he bloody well likes ðŸ˜‚

Part 1 is ez but if ur PokÃ©mon are worn down by part 2 itâ€™s quite a challenge.
The first fight since Cynthia that I had to use revives for so it is one of the toughest fights. I was a couple levels underlevelled  however, but shout out to Torterra for being able to take more than 2 of Giratina's hits so I could revive though. You would need a somewhat tanky PokÃ©mon for this fight if you don't want to use legendaries or overlevel. Being 15 levels higher is just cheesing the fight which is definitely why it wasn't too hard for you. So this fight is pretty hard, especially if you're unprepared for it, but only as far as PokÃ©mon goes
    I did every request I could as I had heard it would be tough and thought you'd get to arceus immediately after it (went in half blind; knew he was evil but didn't know how the game itself would go) so I pretty much overprepared
Depends on how prepared you were. Because I knew it was coming, I came prepared with a great team.

However, otherwise he will reawaken that PTSD you got from Cynthia and her theme music.
My mon were on the same level as his or around some higher some lower. It was a pretty tough to defeat him. Any time you are over leveled in this game, battles are a piece of cake. Sometimes not a bad strategy if you are just into story line and want an easy time so I donâ€™t blame OP for it.
I think if you play to advance the story, he's incredibly hard.

If you play to do the PokÃ©dex to full completion (like I did) not quite as difficult.
well you were 15 levels ahead of him I played through the game just catching pokemon for the pokedex treating it less like a traditional pokemon game and more of a collect them all and not worry about fighting and I had no problems...until I hit volo. needless to say 8 pokemon all around my level? yeah f that I quite literally spent a weak grinding my team to 5 levels higher than his and then barely made it out of that fight. the worst part in the first fight....I never triggered giritina origin form so after I beat giritina alternate form on the 2nd fight and was celebrating I nearly shot my Nintendo switch with my glock when I saw those stupid lil red eyes shine and transform. good job pokemon company well played and the challenging difficulty standard I hold you too.
[removed]
He's not... I went up against him with Empoleon 3 lvls higher and the rest of my team were the same or lower. Had no trouble beating him or Giratina Ice beam with high defense needed but its all about having a well rounded team with most people don't balance their teams in playthroughs. Thought imo Cynthia is over rated too never had trouble with her.
By the time I reached him I had built a competitive-ish team, and I got 5/6 of my team defeated.
In PokÃ©mon terms?

AAAAAAAAAAAA

In gaming terms?

Meh
I cycled my teams a lot, I had 3 or 4 that I juggled both so I wasn't horribly over leveled but also so I could play with Pokemon I wouldn't normally use. 

I haven't had my ass handed to me like that in Pokemon in years. Probably since Black 2.
Arceus was my first pokemon game, I didn't even knew he was that hard and overgrinded my pokemon to max while putting grit stone on them with maxed out EVs. I beat Giratina with only my Umbreon. ðŸ˜…
i used level 100s so jt wasnt hard
Heâ€™s not particularly hard if you have a solid team and are around the same level as him. But he does tend to catch people surprised the first time.
Cynthia is easy by comparison
The hardest pokemon battle iirc

I beat him first try somehow, my team was level 85+, moves were all mastered, and all the grit was maxed

I only got spoilers for giratina having 2 phases but not you having to fight 8 pokemon, i almost lost during giratina origin but earth power missed on my ninetales (it had dark pulse)

Btw unrelated but can we talk about how good that transistion from giratina phase 1 to phase 2 is? The music is also epic too
He's rock hard, you can tell by his face
Look up his team then just build a team with what you think is good against him, and for volo and volo only you're allowed to use the legendaries
I feel like if I didnâ€™t spend 85 hrs in the first region he may have been difficult. But my team was all lv 100 and maxed grit so it was just a regular old battle to me
If you're prepped to destroy the devil you'll be fine. I think I swept through his entire team with one pokemon, but then again I had some Pokemon pushing 99
I got the game release day and I went in blind to the Volo fight. I tried using my underleveled playthrough team,   I gained couple level by fighting him and eventually beat him but then Giratina shows up and I'm left with 1 or 2 mons if I'm lucky and obviously lose. Kept going and by getting lucky I'd end up with 3 mons left at the 1st giratina fight then I'd beat it with a low hp mon and clearly get obliterated round 2. I eventually gave up, So I ran around and caught a few Alphas trained them a bit went back and it still took good RNG but I won. 

My sister on the other hand had to result to using all the legendaries they give you few missions before

To summarize the fight, Difficult but one of the most fun battles ever and I've been playing since the OG red and blue
I can't tell you what it really is I can only tell you what it feels like
Not hard.
Yes
I feel like it depends how much you prepare + if you're overleveled and have maxed out stats. I don't really like overleveling or maxing out stats, so it was more difficult for me. However, I did look up his team in advance and prepared around it. So, it's a bit easier in that sense. 

I think it just comes down to preparation.
in what context ( Í¡Â° ÍœÊ– Í¡Â°)
Like, it is hard if you have no overlevel mon, i oblieterated him with my alpha lvl83 psyduck ice bean/water pulse/a psy move( i dont remember)/maybe calm mind (i dont remember)
well for me i was like 10 levels underlevelled so i had to level up higher to beat him, took a stupid amount of tries even then because im just bad lol
Quite soft tbh. The human body isn't that hard to begin with, just the skeleton really.
Took me like 70 tries becuase I wasnâ€™t thinking about how to go in, first 20 I used my regular team, next 45 I changed my team to all alphas that are good against his team, than the last 5 I changed how I started the battle and got close to beating him than finally getting lucky
If you're rushing through the story, he is probably hard. Nobody's going to be fully prepared to battle two legendaries if they're not training or doing additional stuff.

The one thing that probably made Volo easier for people is that this game strongly encourages exploring and grinding. Most of my pokemon were close to 100 by the time I got to him just because I play the fuck out of the games I play.
If your around the same level its hard, but over leveling always makes things easier. I didn't want spoilers so I over level way to much so I could basically do the fight blind
Fairly hard, especially if you're unprepared, but I knew what was going to happen so I managed to defeat him and Giratina in one go.  I was pretty overleveled though.
Hard as hell.  Took me 22 tries.
I was underleveled when I got to him so he kicked my ass pretty hard.

But once I matched his levels it was pretty easy.
I had to pull out my buff level 85 garchomp that wouldnâ€™t obey me to fight Giratina
Is was around his level I think and only cause I was lollygagging doing everything that isn't the main quests. Only problem is that no one expects it in a PokÃ©mon game. I was left with 1 and a half healthbars on my PokÃ©mon and tbh, I had a Lopunny take it 2-4 of his PokÃ©mon and both of the Giratina phases.
he hard as hell ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ in terms of difficulty, though, he's not a throwaway.
Personally found him hard, but beat him first try since I had level 90 pokemon, I did alot of completing the dex before taking the post game. Giratina still wrecked my shit and almost beat me, tho that might be because I RARELY use healing items or revives. Removes some of the fun for me
Hardest fight in pokemon imo, 8 PokÃ©mon without healing with 2 being the origin and altered girantina forms. (Not to mention his team is basically cynthias)
    Without gastrodon or milotic
        Right
Pretty perfect way to describe it
    Yeah I walked into him not spoilered at a party of 4 lvl 65 mons and 2 guys I was using to fill out their dexs. I lost but changed out the 2 and won handedly no issue. Even made it to the final phase the first time.
I would still rank battling Red at the top of Mt. Silver (Gen 2 and HG/SS) as the most challenging and thrilling battle of the series; he would have spanked Volo imo.
    For me it would be Ultra Necrozma in USUM. I had no idea it was coming and despite being in level parity had absolutely no counters. I lost a lot of times before I just barely managed to win.
        Necrozma was fun. I gave up fighting normally and just decided to use Toxic and just stall the way to victory
I actually ruled that I wouldn't use items in battle so he made half of them faint so it definitely wasn't messing around. Against Giratinas though I took that rule out and used revives

Yeah. Five of her mons as Milotic isn't in the game and fascination with legends. And a fucking Satan himself too!
    Do we know why Milotic didn't make it in?  Seems weird
That ain't right as [Cynthia is 62](https://www.serebii.net/platinum/elitefour.shtml) at her highest in platinum. Are you sure you aren't mixing up bdsp?
    Maybe, but my point of being severely underlevelled stands
Plus a level 1 cleffa for maximum disrespect?
Cresselia learns Ice Fang?!
    Not naturally, with the combat master lady you can learn it. Itâ€™s super effective against most of Voloâ€™s mon and girantina
        Still, Ice Fang on a tender PokÃ©mon like her
            Idk, but itâ€™s super helpful
