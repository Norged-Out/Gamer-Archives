[[Absolutely amazing to actually experience the various townspeople tales from DPPt in PLA]]





Great post. I was wondering about the charred land in that area. It didn't click at all.

The amount of lore building and general attention to detail is pretty great this time around. I especially love seeing Jubilife Village continually evolving, and more people moving in. The Bidoof construction crew is top notch, and who wouldn't want a Mr. Mime defending the village?
    I’ve never liked mr mime but one of the things I realized yesterday and love as a minor detail is when he’s out in the wild he will occasionally make a reflect barrier and when he throws it up pokeballs just bounce off it 😭😭 Like you didn’t have to go that hard.
        Yep! That was fun to see, haha.

Every little attention to detail I pick up on adds to the immersion. Glad they took the time to get some of the really small things right.

One other cool minor detail is that your trainer takes off their shoes when entering people's homes. Nice nod to a Japanese tradition. I thought it was a bug at first when I was trying to change shoes at my trainer's mirror in their home. 😎
            Another one I enjoyed finding yesterday was cranidos and shieldon. I forget the cave name I went through but it has a legitimate fossils of each sticking out of the wall. Just there for looks but it was still cool to see it like that considering how you obtain them in game
                I recently found out one of my Zubat i caught was an alpha and I didn't even notice. Since zubat don't have eyes it did not have the glowing red eyes to signal it was an alpha, i thought that was pretty neat attention to detail.
                    Had the same problem with alpha Dusknoir, his eye is already red and glowing lol
                        I believe alphas are at max size for the pokemon too, like slider max.

Also detectable in overworld
                            yep! But with some of the smaller pokemon it can still be hard to tell. Caught an alpha petilil and didn't know until way later because it wasn't very noticeable and I was just sniping pokemon in the back of the head with feather balls.
                                Yup! It's a luck thing when you play it that way, I loveeee sniping pokemon
                                Also naturally bigger Pokemon are kinda weird too. My normal Arcanine next to my alpha torterra is really weird. They are about the same size yet torterra is an alpha.
                                Yeah I got attacked by an Alpha Zubat and didn't even realize. It was still pretty small; I expect when I evolve it the size difference will be a lot more noticeable.
                                    I'm pretty sure the size cap still is pretty small for some of the models, which imo isn't the worst thing as it gives you a lil surprise when your realize you got what you had
                    me too! I was like 'when tf did i find an alpha zubat???' before i realized that i probably just thought it was a big boi
                    I ended up fighting a Zubat and when I caught it I got a notification of having caught an Alpha :p
                I can hear the music now.
            >Nice nod to a Japanese tradition.

Do you people not take off your shoes when entering a home???
                It's not very common in Texas at the least. I've only been in one house that had hosts request guests remove their shoes.
                    Cool thanks for letting me know! I guess here in Canada with winter and mud and all we have to if we don't want to ruin our floors.
                        Ah yes, mud and snow usually aren't a worry in the part of Texas I live in. May be a more common custom up in the Panhandle, but I never really go up there. Mostly we have wind and dust, and those don't care about your shoes, dust is coming in with the wind when ya open the door if they are on or off.
                            Sounds like west Texas. I did some landscaping work there recently. I hated the wind blowing dirt into my eyes constantly.
                Yes but it’s for comfort and less of a traditional thing like in Japan where you’re expected to
            BRO I THOUGHT MY GAME GLITCHED WHEN I CHANGED SHOES 

Thank you for this
            Same here! I went back into the box three different times putting the uniform on. I was like where the hell are my shoes?!?
            The same thing happens in yo-kai watch games so when it happened I was used to it and knew what it was
L
        I love running through it and standing there and bonking him on the head with one while the barrier is up. It’s hilarious!
        Mr mime will also occasionally pretend to sit down and pour some tea like he does in detective pikachu
        If you watch one from the grass for a while, he will cross his legs and sit down on an invisible chair and drink invisible tea.
        Hah I did the same thing and thought it was a pretty cool touch to add
        Yo how come Reddit gave us identical avatars….u my long lost twin!?
            Where’d you get those shades though 😎
                Random reddit. It just said hey look at this avatar.
        If you watch one from the grass for a while, he will cross his legs and sit down on an invisible chair and drink invisible tea.
    Yeah just seeing how Hisui evolved into the Sinnoh we know and love is fantastic, another detail I noticed was there being a cemetery in the area where the Lost Tower would eventually be built. I'm absolutely having fun lore-hunting and comparing the maps of both games. With a year more of development and polish PLA would truly be one of the finest games this generation.
        Where is that in relation to the ruins?? I don't think I've found that lol
            It's in the west of Coronet Highlands, near "Bolderoll Ravine"
                Ohh, that makes sense. I thought it would be in the mirelands. I still havent gotten to that part yet lol
    Also, it appeared to me that Sudowoodo stands still when you approach and just pretends to be a tree. Love this game!
    That sidequest was really fun!
    All jokes aside a Mr Mine would be incredibly useful with its abilities
Mild spoilers but theres a side request where you figure out a way to get the flowers to start growing, aswell as catch a mythical pokemon at the same time!
    I had looked that up yeah. Unfortunately, I do not have the prerequisites to "activate" that side quest, but it's so great they added it regardless!
        If you really want to do this but don't want to buy the game, you should look into your local library systems to see if they have a video game section. My hometown doesn't, but a big city nearby does and I was able to go there to borrow Let's Go and get my Mew in BDSP.
        what are the prerequisites?
            You need to have save data for SwSh on your switch.
                Let me guess, flying flower hedge?
                    damn i knew that skiploom would come in handy
    You use Brawndo, right?
        That's what the plants crave!
            It's got Electrolytes!
    Is that required to complete the Pokédex?
        I don’t think mythicals are part of the Pokédex but I could be wrong
    That’s amazing! This is game has great lore and world-building.
The attention to detail and the connections between Hisui and Sinnoh are probably the leading cause of my addiction to this game. That and throwing all my pokemon out into a circle and watching them interact with each other.
    What. I didn't know they interact with each other :o I never even thought about throwing more than one out, thanks for this info!
        Yes! So throw out one Pokemon. Then, when you throw out the others, make sure they're targeting the first one, they'll all be in a circle and interact with each other! It's really cool to watch :)
I honestly love what they did with Hisui to tie it back into Sinnoh. It gives a whole new way to see the region and how it ties back to Sinnoh, making it actually feel like you are in old Sinnoh. 

I love this game so much.
There are so many things I love finding.
    Same!
Yo this is exactly the kinda post I love. Thanks for this info, I’m obsessed with how steeped in lore this game is
    you're welcome! I'm thinking to do more like these, the attention to detail is baffling
        Please do!!! I keep belatedly connecting dots like these but I know I'm missing a lot of stuff and I'd love to see a compilation of connections like this 😊
            Just did another! [Here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonLegendsArceus/comments/si13ck/another_comparison_post_of_a_very_accurately/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)Only check it out if you have explored the third area of the game.
                Thank you for letting me know!!! I love these!
I literally called this months ago and got like 10 upvotes lol
    Great prediction man
I find it funny how there is people that say that legends goes against the sinnoh lore even though sinnoh lore said that the arceus plates are from giants(the Nobles) and then we have this aswell.

Plus many more small hits here and there.
    on top of that, only in recent years has the pokemon lore started to unravel into something that is more consistent. there’s been plenty of small inconsistencies or different wording used for connections/references so this really isn’t a stretch
Not to mention sandgem flats and the lake
    Ramanas Island (Pal Park was renamed to Ramanas Park in BDSP), and Oreburgh Tunnel as well.
In the Shaymin quest >!you see the flowers blooming actually !<
    dear lord i am excited to do the Shaymin quest 😩 for once i'm glad i bought SwSh
        RIP Darkrai for me
            Honestly that was the reason I bought brilliant diamond but then it surprised me with some of the hardest gym battles + elite 4 I can remember
            I will always say to check your library! I have *Shining Pearl*, but I'd like to get save data for *Brilliant Diamond* on my Switch. I just found out my library carries it, but it's checked out. I have to wait a few weeks, but it's free.
                Why specifically BD if you already have SP?
                    Mainly because in HOME it shows all the games you have linked. I have Let's Go! Pikachu and Eevee (my roommate owned one and I rented the other to get the version exclusives). Then I bought Sword and my roommate bought Shield, so I played both. I'm informally OCD when it comes to symmetry, so it would feel weird to not have BD show up, even if all I do is start a new save and return it to the library. More likely what I'll do is deposit the starter in the PC so I can, at the very least, transfer the starter over so I have at least one Pokémon from that game/trainer ID. If I can stomach another play-through, I'll even progress far enough to get the gift Mew and Jirachi.
                        Stfuuuu nobody is informally ocd 😱😱😱
I thought it was a patch of grass and flowers that all the wurmples and beautifly ate from
OMG I was wondering about this spot! Can't believe it didn't click with the DP/BDSP lore.
I was wondering why there was this random dead spot. That's so cool!
Is there a list/compilation of these comparisons? Would love to see that
    No there aren't yet, as far as I've looked up. I'm planning to do a few comparisons myself. Here's [Snowpoint Temple](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/sgycv3/this_is_the_true_sinnoh_remake/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) for example, you can see the part of the temple in the front that remained in modern-day Sinnoh, and the large edifice behind that may have crumbled over time.
        Thanks for sharing this dude! I love this stuff so much haha
Good catch! Love these tiny details
I wasn't expecting ramanas in this game to be honest
this is too cool man no way 😍😍😍😍
Isn't there also an npc called floara in the village?
My game still hasn’t arrived. Losing hope….
why is that area infested with roaches
    They're dried up flowers
Thank you! I haven’t played BDSP. So, I liked to know the references to its future. Probably play BDSP later in the year.
And yet, as far as I can tell, there is no river in Jubilife city. Despite having one in the village.
    My personal headcannon is that Jubilife Village grew to the point it split itself into two different cities, Jubilife and Canalave, there's a river in between the both of them (Route 218) and Canalave seems to be geographically the more accurate location of the village, situated slightly northwest of Lake Verity, instead of northeast like Jubilife City. Here's a reference [picture](http://i.imgur.com/x3ajd0e.jpg)

Edit: I think this theory is further supported by the fact that the second half of Jubilife Village is called "Canala" Avenue, and is crossed by the Canala Bridge.
        Ah. That makes sense. Still disappointing to see that the village is so off from the city. I would hope that they would maintain the main building in the village. (I've never played diamond/pearl) 

It is a cool building that seems like it should have survived.
            I agree. You should definitely give Platinum a shot! Still my favorite Pokemon game of all time.
                I have brilliant diamond, but I bought it the same day as Arceus.
I did wonder if the name meant that’s where Floaroma Town would end up but then the map location seems completely off.
    It’s not all that rare, historically, for towns to have shifted from their original location. Think of Hisui as America back in the settler days. A lot of towns popped up around gold mines but died up when the mines did (ghost towns) and there are other towns that were moved for various reasons, like their current location was the source of X precious metal or the population grew outwards to Side B while Side A was vacated over time and eventually became the outskirts.

Sorry for nerding out
    I think It is possible that the land may have shifted slightly or changed over time
Dead flowers beginning to grow. Fitting.
Woah! I love this game so much because of its origins. I am a sucker for periodic themed games. And when it connects to the future of another game we can compare and contrast! (Projecting Laser eyes hype*)
I loved the Spear Pillar detail honestly.
I gotta play those games again now. I've never finished them I believe, the region never "clicked" for me - but I'll have to pay more attention to where things are and their names now!
Love this game
![img](emote|t5_40vn2t|6919)
This doesnt make too much sense, geographically. Floaroma Town should be much more north IMO
    It’s possible the town moved and it’s still a reference.. or perhaps the land shifted/changed over time
okay but when do we get to marry a pokemon
What is DPPt? Is this region were in from another game? Forgive me I haven't played since Ruby
I hadn’t even realized oh my gosh
I do find it a little weird how small Floaroma town is supposedly in Legends Arceus. I know that it's the origins of the town, but why would the towns people care so much about a small patch of dead grass in the middle of a field that's all green?
    Because of Shaymin, the patch of grass isn't important as such, but the story is important.
I’ve never liked mr mime but one of the things I realized yesterday and love as a minor detail is when he’s out in the wild he will occasionally make a reflect barrier and when he throws it up pokeballs just bounce off it 😭😭 Like you didn’t have to go that hard.

                        Also naturally bigger Pokemon are kinda weird too. My normal Arcanine next to my alpha torterra is really weird. They are about the same size yet torterra is an alpha.
                        Yeah I got attacked by an Alpha Zubat and didn't even realize. It was still pretty small; I expect when I evolve it the size difference will be a lot more noticeable.
                            I'm pretty sure the size cap still is pretty small for some of the models, which imo isn't the worst thing as it gives you a lil surprise when your realize you got what you had
            me too! I was like 'when tf did i find an alpha zubat???' before i realized that i probably just thought it was a big boi
            I ended up fighting a Zubat and when I caught it I got a notification of having caught an Alpha :p
        I can hear the music now.
    >Nice nod to a Japanese tradition.

Do you people not take off your shoes when entering a home???
        It's not very common in Texas at the least. I've only been in one house that had hosts request guests remove their shoes.
            Cool thanks for letting me know! I guess here in Canada with winter and mud and all we have to if we don't want to ruin our floors.
                Ah yes, mud and snow usually aren't a worry in the part of Texas I live in. May be a more common custom up in the Panhandle, but I never really go up there. Mostly we have wind and dust, and those don't care about your shoes, dust is coming in with the wind when ya open the door if they are on or off.
                    Sounds like west Texas. I did some landscaping work there recently. I hated the wind blowing dirt into my eyes constantly.
        Yes but it’s for comfort and less of a traditional thing like in Japan where you’re expected to
    BRO I THOUGHT MY GAME GLITCHED WHEN I CHANGED SHOES 

Thank you for this
    Same here! I went back into the box three different times putting the uniform on. I was like where the hell are my shoes?!?
    The same thing happens in yo-kai watch games so when it happened I was used to it and knew what it was
L
I love running through it and standing there and bonking him on the head with one while the barrier is up. It’s hilarious!
Mr mime will also occasionally pretend to sit down and pour some tea like he does in detective pikachu
If you watch one from the grass for a while, he will cross his legs and sit down on an invisible chair and drink invisible tea.
Hah I did the same thing and thought it was a pretty cool touch to add
Yo how come Reddit gave us identical avatars….u my long lost twin!?
    Where’d you get those shades though 😎
        Random reddit. It just said hey look at this avatar.

Where is that in relation to the ruins?? I don't think I've found that lol
    It's in the west of Coronet Highlands, near "Bolderoll Ravine"
        Ohh, that makes sense. I thought it would be in the mirelands. I still havent gotten to that part yet lol
If you really want to do this but don't want to buy the game, you should look into your local library systems to see if they have a video game section. My hometown doesn't, but a big city nearby does and I was able to go there to borrow Let's Go and get my Mew in BDSP.
what are the prerequisites?
    You need to have save data for SwSh on your switch.
        Let me guess, flying flower hedge?
            damn i knew that skiploom would come in handy
That's what the plants crave!
    It's got Electrolytes!
I don’t think mythicals are part of the Pokédex but I could be wrong
Yes! So throw out one Pokemon. Then, when you throw out the others, make sure they're targeting the first one, they'll all be in a circle and interact with each other! It's really cool to watch :)
Please do!!! I keep belatedly connecting dots like these but I know I'm missing a lot of stuff and I'd love to see a compilation of connections like this 😊
    Just did another! [Here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonLegendsArceus/comments/si13ck/another_comparison_post_of_a_very_accurately/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)Only check it out if you have explored the third area of the game.
        Thank you for letting me know!!! I love these!
RIP Darkrai for me
    Honestly that was the reason I bought brilliant diamond but then it surprised me with some of the hardest gym battles + elite 4 I can remember
    I will always say to check your library! I have *Shining Pearl*, but I'd like to get save data for *Brilliant Diamond* on my Switch. I just found out my library carries it, but it's checked out. I have to wait a few weeks, but it's free.
        Why specifically BD if you already have SP?
            Mainly because in HOME it shows all the games you have linked. I have Let's Go! Pikachu and Eevee (my roommate owned one and I rented the other to get the version exclusives). Then I bought Sword and my roommate bought Shield, so I played both. I'm informally OCD when it comes to symmetry, so it would feel weird to not have BD show up, even if all I do is start a new save and return it to the library. More likely what I'll do is deposit the starter in the PC so I can, at the very least, transfer the starter over so I have at least one Pokémon from that game/trainer ID. If I can stomach another play-through, I'll even progress far enough to get the gift Mew and Jirachi.
                Stfuuuu nobody is informally ocd 😱😱😱
Thanks for sharing this dude! I love this stuff so much haha
Ah. That makes sense. Still disappointing to see that the village is so off from the city. I would hope that they would maintain the main building in the village. (I've never played diamond/pearl) 

It is a cool building that seems like it should have survived.
    I agree. You should definitely give Platinum a shot! Still my favorite Pokemon game of all time.
        I have brilliant diamond, but I bought it the same day as Arceus.
Another one I enjoyed finding yesterday was cranidos and shieldon. I forget the cave name I went through but it has a legitimate fossils of each sticking out of the wall. Just there for looks but it was still cool to see it like that considering how you obtain them in game
    I recently found out one of my Zubat i caught was an alpha and I didn't even notice. Since zubat don't have eyes it did not have the glowing red eyes to signal it was an alpha, i thought that was pretty neat attention to detail.
        Had the same problem with alpha Dusknoir, his eye is already red and glowing lol
            I believe alphas are at max size for the pokemon too, like slider max.

Also detectable in overworld
                yep! But with some of the smaller pokemon it can still be hard to tell. Caught an alpha petilil and didn't know until way later because it wasn't very noticeable and I was just sniping pokemon in the back of the head with feather balls.
