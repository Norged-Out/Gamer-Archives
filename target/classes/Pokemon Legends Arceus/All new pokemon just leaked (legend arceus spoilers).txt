[[All new pokemon just leaked (legend arceus spoilers)]]





Dude what happened to Palkia
    It looks like they're fused with Arceus, Kyurem style
        I understand the lore reasons for  Kyurem and Necrozma, but why would Arceus fuse with his own creations?
            I assume that's what the game will be about, but my guess is that it's forced to by the humans
                If that's the case I will instantly forgive these atrocious designs, as there are supposed to look absolutely horrible
                    Bruh they got a gigalith stuck in dialga's throat
                        Its like that squidward choking on a fork meme
                How would they be forced, in BW I understand it they had the technology. But this game is set 2000(?) years ago so like how?
             "Well, first of all, through God all things are possible, so jot that down."
            Alabama joke.
            My guess is that it isn't fused, but rather purified

God made us in his image, Arceus made Palkia and Dialga in his image, and over time they lost some of their power
        I don't like the movement twords more and more legendaries doing this. It feels like it takes away from Kyurem's whole shtick.
            But kyurems whole thing is that it's still incomplete even after it fuses 
The other pokemon are complete before they fuse 
So if we get a gen5 remake or a legend for the gen 5 region  we will probably get yet another form
                I want to see the Original Dragon Pokemon so bad.
                    Don’t know why we ain’t got a game based on it yet and have that as the legendary, baffled.
                        Maybe we'll get it in a future Unova based legends game
                            Shit, that's a great idea. It could follow the original conflict between truth and ideals! ~~And maybe your choice between the two will actually affect the story!~~
                                Pokemon Legends Kyurem would kick ass. I'd play that
                            Man imagine a legebds game based on kalos. On what happened 3000 yrs ago. And the adventure of zygarde and that hero greninja who save the entire kalos region from shambles.
    its one with arceus now
        Still, they messed dialga and palkia big time
            I don't dislike the new form...but I think palkia needs arms to balance out
                Yeah Palkia could've looked alright. His design already resembles a gladiator, so some arms and he would've been a cool celestial centaur.  
Dialga on the other hand...
            I think as long as the narrative makes sense for the change in design then I'll be happy with it. At least this explains why there was no new form in BDSP
                Probably will have something to do with the weird statue that represented both of them in the OG diamond and pearl.
                    Yeah they look a lot like the eterna (or rockveil i don't remember) statue
        I think it's actually the opposite, they will fuse to make arceus. It's more lore accurate
            If true, that'd be a kind of neat retcon. Dialga seems to have more Arceus elements than the other.

Doesn’t change the fact that Palkia looks like an eldritch horror though.
                Well not necessarily dialga has the cross and palkia has the outer rings
    Why the fuck is it a horse

Why a fucking horse
        I think it's meant to be Arceus' torso
        It's nnot even a horse it's like

armless centaur
    I’m gonna have to be blunt. The new Dialga and Palkia are bar non, not gonna argue otherwise, the most fucking ugly Pokémon ever created. It’s like that one deformed image of garfield before his humanity was restored.

            Typhlosion looks drugged out of his mind
                Players: We want Typhlosion to be burning again  
Gamefreak: Well he will be blazing alright
                    if you didn't see cyndaquil has his fire on all the time again, this is the model without the in game visual effects
                    Ngl I kinda love stoned Typhlosion. Dude needed to chill a little, and now he can.
                I think it's hilarious and I'm picking him. Highphlosion is great.
                    Higpholsion and tyedye Weedville are 100% on my team. Gonna make a wook themed team for this run hahaha.
                    “Highphlosion” is genius and definitely the nickname I’ll be picking. Rowlet is one of my all-time favourite across the generations, but I might have to go cindaquil just for that last form.
                    Highphlosion… shit that’s good.
                    I’d smoke that.
                He took one look at what they did to Palkia and Dialga and had to tranq the shit out of him.
            No, don't tell me that's supposed to be typhlosion. Stop. ☠️
            Looks like drowzee
            I'm pretty sure Typhlosion (and others shown here) will look better when animated. and I think it's a safe guess that Typhlosion is fire/ghost and will have those purple wisp flames around him when animated and he'll look much better.
        Palkia straight up has nipples on his shoulders, the Arceus ring looks like plastic, and the lower body is a mush of play dough.
        Sword and Shield fossil Pokémon would like to have a word.
            They at least had an excuse, since their inspirations were chimera fossils made out of many different animals to draw attention or just because they didn't know any better
    Evolution (or lack thereof)
    He looks so fucking stupid and I’m not gonna act like he doesn’t
    MADE IN HEAVEN
    It is exactly like the statue in the 2nd gym's city in Pearl/Diamond!
If you stare at Dialga and Palkia long enough, you can almost hear Giratina laughing from the distortion world.
    It laughs until Game Freak decides that Giratina needs a Hisui form too and they give it a dildo coming out of its head
        This would spawn so much rule 34.

        Bad dragon
    Dawn: Hey Giratina how come you have two forms, but Dialga and Palkia have only one?

Giratina: (rips open a portal from laughing so hard)
    I even kind of like Dialga. It's okay.

Palkia, on the other hand, looks like someone put a poodle through the worst makeup routine in Sinnoh
    Damn this needs to be higher up.

Edit. 

You beautiful redditors you did it, you really did it.
Palkia looks like a failed clone begging for its life to end
    Ed..ward..
        *small child fused with dog to create abomination*

Scar: yep its gamer time 😎
            I’m gonna do what’s called a “pro gamer move”
            Scar: “Hey kid. High five—TOOSLOW—“

***BOOM***
        Oh god, I can't relive that moment, not again
        Ptsd intensifies
        No. Just no. Not again.
        Too soon
    Palkia looks better than whatever is coming out of Dialga’s neck
        He swallowed a giant water bottle; don't question it.
            He thought the only way to beat Palkia was to become the water bottle 🧐 steel/dragon/water..bottle
    Kill…me……
Dialga really has that Squidward chokes on a fork energy
    [look at what they did to my boy](https://imgur.com/MXy4AW0)
        Man the amount of effort you must have put into making this, fair play, that's hilarious
            I wish I could draw this well. I just took it from /v/.
Why does ursaring have the proportions of a sea bear from spongebob.
    Here draw a circle!
        That’s an oval it has to be a circle!!!
            “What’d I do that time??”
“I don’t know,I guess he just doesn’t like you!”
                “Pretend to be someone else!”
            This circle would never protect us against a sea rhinosarus.
                Good thing we're all wearing our anti-sea rhinoceros underwear! Haha right Squidward?
            Cubed. Sliced is fine.
    Omg, I can totally see the Sea Bear in it now!
    Because he is now a "Full Moon" Bear, drawing from his name coming from the Ursa constellations
    Why does he look so ashamed. Why do all these Pokemon look like they are suffering from existential dread?
        Mirroring the qualities of the target audience is sometimes an excellent way to attract consumers. Maybe it’s because many of us are suffering from existential dread.
     A sea bear? You mean like the ones that... *don't exist?*
    It's it's evolution. It has ascended and became Freddy Fatbear
    Tbh, I like it. I’ve always liked Ursaring, but it always looked more like a man-in-a-bear-suit than an actual bear. The humped shoulders and quadrupedalism makes it look more like the actual animal.


I bet they wanted to give Ursaring a more natural-looking design reminiscent of the [brown bears that live in Hokkaido](https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5189/5585318214_e1059162a4_b.jpg) - Hokkaido being the basis behind Sinnoh and Hesui.
    I thought I needed one when I saw it, but now I fucking need one and to nickname it Sea Bear
    i wonder if he will attract a sea rhydon attack
Also the Palkia looks like a centaur who lost his arms in battle and they were replaced with shields to hide the stumps lmao
    I'm wondering if he actually does have arms, they're just made using some special effect that can only be shown when animated.
        [removed]
    I like to imagine they’re just really tiny hands holding shields.
        *NOBODY LOOK!*

*NOBODY LOOK*
    Palkia looks like some paleontologist made a bad sketch of what an animal might look like based on an incomplete skeleton.
Is depression the theme for the  region?
    Ursaring lost his reason to live, while Typhlosion realized his was marijuana
        Weavile came to the same conclusion
            In this region, Sneasel evolves into

S

N

E

A

S

E

L
                Sneasonal Depression
            Weedvile
        I demand justice for typhlosion
            It will likely have purple ghostly flames so that’s cool
        Typhlosion just be chilling in a cloud of smoke.
    And goodra looks like it’s having an existential crisis
        I would too if I came out of the design room dripping with white goo.
    Considering a lot of the species go extinct, I would say they have a right to be depressed
        You know what, that is fair
    I hate this trend with the bored half opened eyes design. They never look good on any Pokémon
    There’s a reason most of them are extinct..
    >I'm wondering if he actually does have arms, they're just made using some special effect that can only be shown when animated.

Nah man, it's SCP Foundation.

Therapist: "Don't worry, centaur Palkia can't hurt you"

Me: "You're right cause it has no fuckin' arms"
    *Gets trampled*
    I'm more terrified of tall sneasel
        Look how they massacred my boy...
    You ever fight a horse?

You'll lose, buddy.
What are number 14/15? Right after ursaring?
    It's a new force of nature like thunderous, tornadus and landorous
        Damn didn’t know they made Bruxish into a force of nature
            It has a weird semblance to Ghirahim to me.
                Or the love child of Him from Powerpuff Girls and Ghirahim. 

"Himahim"
                    Owner of the Himsdale Himmadome?
        What is the typing?
            It is confirmed Fairy/Flying
                So then love is a force of nature? I kind of hope it's name isn't Lovurus..
                    It’s called Enamorus
            Looks like fairy flying

Togekiss PTSD
            I don't think it's been stated yet, but given the colouration, I'd presume Fairy.
        It's the pokemon that's going to stop the Mongols from invading
        Whatever it is, whoever designed it should be fired

From a cannon
    I forget if the name already leaked but its a new addition to the Forces of Nature (Thundurus/Tornadus/Landorus).
        I just realized that Nintendo just made the fourth Chinese Heavenly Beast. We currently have This new one as the Black Turtle of the North, Thunderus as the Azure dragon of the East, Tornadus as the Vermilion Bird of the South, and Landorus as the White Tiger of the West. Next we may see the Golden Kirin of the Center.
            I think Arceus is supposed to be based on a kirin
                And Mt Coronet/Spear Pillar are in the center
                Holy shit this changes everything

Fimfiction prepare yourselves for I am armed with more knowledge
                Shiny Arceus is also golden.
    Force of Nature, the force of love, covers the snake turtle from 4 animal gods that the genies are based on.
        RIP the force of love is dead in present day Pokémon.
            I blame humanity for that one.

Just look at what happened to these pokemon:

Corsola -> galarian Corsola

Zorua -> hisuian zorua

hisuian voltorb -> voltorb
                (Ir)regular reminder of Togekiss' PokéDex entry:

> It will never appear where there is strife. Its sightings have become rare recently.
                    What a oddly haunting pokedex entry, it's such a simple one too. What the fuck was going on with the guy who wrote that
                    >ok at what happened to these pokemon:  
>  
>Corsola -> galarian Corsola

imagine if a few generation later togekiss is considered a mythical
    It’s Him.
        My thoughts exactly! 

For those that don't know: [Devil from PowerPuff Girls](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/powerpuff/images/1/1f/HIMPPG.png/revision/latest?cb=20190825175358)
Dialga and Palkia look more like an error in the system.

Edit: I do get they are suppose to look like Arceus but I can’t stand it.
    Like messed up Digimon evolutions halfway through digivolving
        [deleted]
            Skullgreymon be like
        Honestly Lilligant reminds me a lot of Lilamon, just inverting colors
    they look like an AI tried to recreate Palkia based off of only 10 blurry photos
        And two of those blurry photos were actually of missingno
    Dialga doesn't even have feet
        Fucking toasters for arms
    Dialga looks alright, but Palkia... What the hell happened here?
        Mistakes were made.
        How does Dialga look alright? He looks like he swallowed an oversized brolen fidget spinner
        Still think Primal Dialga looks better.
        dialga does NOT look alright, the fuck??? look at his neck it’s like that scene where squidward chokes on a fork 


look at his feet what the fuck it’s like his toes are on pizza tables
    Dialga looks like it swallowed a water bottle and it got stuck half way down
    These are just the base models so for all we know they have special animations or textures to them that make them look better. I hope...

Cause where are Palkia's arms???
        Gone, reduced to atoms
    Honestly lore wise that probably accurate. Like Arceus possesses them but it messed up halfway.
I was hoping for Gastrodon and Shellos alt forms after noticing in the Shining Pearl dex that Gastrodon's entry mentions that in ancient times it used to have a shell on its back.

I also noticed in Weezing's Nat Dex description the mention of triple forms occasionally being found so I wonder if thats a hint for another future form or if I'm just overanalyzing it.

Edit: So I don't have to explain multiple times here is a reply about me knowing that the time period of the setting does not take place in ancient times.

I realize that but was wondering and kind of hoping that supposed "older forms" of pokemon would be present or included. Another thing I've been speculating on is fossil mons and possibly an older form of it being available in game that way because I can't really see them just completely removing fossil pokemon especially Cranidos and Shieldon completely from the game.

Another person brought up the possibility of the Gastrodon and Goodra line sharing a common ancestor and I think that would be a cool aspect to explore.
    I too was looking for a shelled Gastrodon. Idk why they decided to give the shell to goodra instead!
        Maybe Gastrodon split off from the Goodra line? After all, one's pink and one's blue; meanwhile, Goodra is lavender.
            This is the perfect example of two intrests I love falling together perfectly: Pokemon and speculative biology/evolution.
        What if we got a fossil ancestor that connects goomy, shellos, and slugma?
    that weezing entry has been around in similar phrasing since original gen 4 iirc
        Oh ok. I've never noticed it before for some reason.
            Could be cool if Weezing's shiny had a alternate model with three. I always thought it was a missed opportunity. If a dex entry mentions a rare variant it should be referenced in the shiny.
                Crystal onyx
    This game is not set in “ancient times”, it’s like the 1800s.

 I am also curious about the area around where Floaroma is located and if the Shaymin myth will be explored based off of the dialogue of an npc saying nothing would grow there until someone expressed graditude causing the area to burst into bloom. I'm remembering this off the top of my head so sorry if I don't have the exact wording.
Why do they all look so… freaky?
    putting the freak in gamefreak
    [deleted]
        people were asking for more gender variants.
        THAT IS FLUFF-
            Can we NOT have another Pokkèn Blaziken incident?
    Seems tied to how we got the models. I wouldnt freak out on most of em just yet

Exception being palkia, Jesus christ something went wrong there
    Typhosion hit the blunt to hard
    I kinda like Decidueye but the rest of them are kind of ehhh. Decidueye reminds me of the straw hat ronin from Ghost of Tsushima
Palkia: I HAVE BECOME HORSE!
    Dialga: I AM NO LONGER HORSE!
Tell me that Dialga and Palkia are jokes, please
    Looks like Dialga has something stuck in his throat.
        He swallowed his pride
    [deleted]
        wait so no joke this… this is real? Holy fucking shit these designs are atrocious.
    Dialga looks okay I guess but palkia looks so goofy
        After looking at them again, I can say that Dialga isn't that bad (despite the difference in the shape of the legs), but Palkia is still so... unnatural.

The shoulders are what I can't stand

Why take a dragon and turn it into a centaur without arms?
            the dialgia one just looks more …. sharp i guess. not the worst thing ever and i could see it looking badass in game. however…. palkia i cannot wrap my head around what it could possibly look like in game to make this design cool. and this comes from someone who much rather prefers palkia over dialgia in the original games.
Is that a new member of the Genies of a Healthy Meta I see?
    I saw a post today that said "Lando-T is its own biggest check" and i nearly lost it
        This comment is being overwritten in protest of Reddit's CEO spez (Steve Huffman) being a piece of shit and killing 3rd party apps.
            Wasn't Klefki also a big abuser of all three of those things? I actually remember Klefki being more overt considering that was its primary niche.

For Lando-T though, it does pretty much every single role, and does them well. If you're struggling to think of something to fill out your team, the answer is probably Lando-T. Looking at the Pikalytics OU usage stats, it has a **52.75%** usage. That is *insane*. The next highest is Ferrothorn at 26.81%.
                I used to run swagkey and mega kanga in gen 5 3v3s and it was amazing. Swagger, T-wave, foul play on klefki and scrappy return/EQ/PUP/Shadow Claw for kanga. Always loved not using mega first turn and getting the PUP into their ghost type because I was still scrappy.
Nice to see them giving some love to Qwilfish, I feel like it’s one of those Pokémon that not a lot of people really talk about
    Finally they got their evolution. It was scrapped, but now it comes in a new look with the variants.
        No, not finaly. My boy qwilfish just got fucked by this thing. Now he will be even more forgoten and everyone will use hisuian form. Why couldnt they just give johto qwilfish evolution like they did with stantler?
            Actually, quilfish can run an eviolite now so its usage is going to skyrocket
                Actually he can not, only hisuian Qwilfish can, old water poison still cant
                    Oh shoot, I didn’t think we were getting one. Hopefully it has similar stats and keeps intimidate and swift swim.
                    It doesn't look like there will be a Hisuian Qwilfish if it isn't in this leak. There isn't an Alolan Cubone that evolves into Alolan Marowak. If regular Qwilfish is the one that evolves into this new form then it'll basically just be like any other cross gen evolution and the eviolite will work.
    [deleted]
        Yeah, t-spikes and intimidate and stab on grass types is great.
What's with the tall Sneasel? I assume it's Weavile alt form but legit just looks the Sneasel got put on a rack lol
    It hung out with inteleon too much
    I'm getting flashbacks from Alolan Persian
        What about the Meowth Galar evolution?
            And I _almost_ forgot about it until you brought it up
    Not Weavile but a new evo
        Makes sense but still not a fan of slender sneasel
    Slender Sneasel isn't real, Slender Sneasel can't hurt me...
    I'm just staring at it thinking "was this necessary?"

It still looks like an ice type, and it looks worse than normal Sneasel and Weavile.
    Yeah this is the one that made me audibly say “what have they done?” hahahaha!
    I'm so tired of humanoids Mons getting more humanoid every time.
It looks like some furry on Deviantart wanted to make them more fuckable for them.
    It's a FNaF OC now
    I was hype when I heard of a new Sneasel Regional form/Evo, but… I may just keep H-Sneasel as Sneasel. It should have passable stats for in-game.
    srsly, why would you change an alrady perfect weavile?
    It’s name is fucking Sneasler lmao
    It’s called Sneasler and I can’t stop laughing at it
    Sneasel is an all time favorite for me, but I’ve never been satisfied with weavile. Gamefreak responded by saying “it could be worse”.
Why are they all so sad, dark and filthy????
    They know they’re going extinct
        wait I didn't even think about this, all these forms are doomed to die and go extinct lmfao
            And yet, we'll probably have a way to transfer them to mainline games.

                    Oof that is harsh. I hope they find a one-way time portal instead. Dialga is the god of time, after all. Could make a little wormhole
                    Didn’t something like that happen to a Lucario in that one movie
            It's okay. If they get fossilized they can be miraculously brought back to life for some reason.
                “Life, uh, finds a way.”
                Why didn’t I think of this as a reason to have these Pokémon in future games? This whole time I’ve been thinking these new Hisuian Pokémon are cool but I haven’t been able to get super excited about them because they won’t be in the meta in the future. But if they decide they want to bring back some of these Pokémon, they totally could in the form of fossils. And actually, there could totally be a secluded area of a region in a future game that is a home to ancient Hisuian Growlithe. Totally possible to do tbh
        Thank god they did in the current Pokémon timeline. If I had to use that Hisuian typhlosion in the original/remake johto games I would’ve dropped Pokémon a long time ago
            Mf only knows one move, blaze
    Word on the street is that the models being passed around are of particularly low quality, which happens when you have a leak and some one quickly does a rip of all of the models. Hopefully we'll either get to see them in action/ better quality soon because apparently Typhlosion actually looks cool with the flame effect and we just haven't seen it yet.
        Of all the designs leaked today, I actually kind of like the more subdued look Typhlosion has. I'm very excited to see its flames, of course, but it'll be nice to start with a Ghost/Fire starter. I've been wanting to play with a ghost team from the start for ages(I missed out on Alola).
            Typhlosion is Ghost/Fire?
                That’s the big rumor, yeah
    Just look at fucking magikarp’s 3D ripped design, it looks terrible compared to what we actually get in game.
Excited for Dragon/Steel Goodra, but seeing sad Goodra makes me sad too.
    They literally just put a shell on the boy. Like, it *works,* but it doesn’t work because it’s a *new* design - it’s the equivalent of putting a hat on Pikachu.
        Well I’m guessing they did that to go from slug to snail
    Are we sure it’s not Dragon Bug type since that made it part snail?
        Earlier leaks said Dragon/Steel and they've been pretty spot on with what was leaked today.
        snails aren't bugs they're mollusks which includes clams, oysters, octopus, and squid
        Snails aren't really bugs tho. They are Mollusks like squids and octopi.
I am choosing rowlet and probably gonna try and pick up a goodra.
    I liked all 3 starters and thought I would pick fire this time. But upon seeing the final forms rowlet is the only one I still like
        typhlosion is still a wild card, no flames yet
            Typhlosion looks like it just wants a hug
                Looks high af
            This. We still haven’t seen it with flames on.
                i hate that typhlosion doesnt have constant flames ever since the 3d swap. one of the coolest sprites reduced to a smooth noodle boy.
                    If we look the cyndaquil model has constant flames but this model just has them off it will probably have constant flames as well
                    If you look at previews and leaked footage, Cyndaquil has flames a good portion of the time. They’re not a part of the model, but rather seem to be some sort of particle effect. It’s totally possible Typhlosion will have flames (or ghost wisps or whatever) virtually all of the time. But that won’t come across in a still render likely just pulled from the obj file
                    I like this one’s mellow mood already, and also the flames look like they’ll stay on because Cyndaquil has them all the time.
    That decidueye form looks really good
The fuck are those Dialga and Palkia designs? Like Dialga I sort of get is supposed to be crystalline there (Though that makes little sense for the master of time imo), Palkia looks like someone threw a centuar and a kraken in a blender and painted it white a purple before attaching palkia’s head
    They're definitely some kind of Dialga and Palkia mixed with Arceus designs a la Kyurem, and the leaks have confirmed >!Time travel to explain away tech in the region, so the mixes are probably man made mistakes!<
    They look like artificially fusions of them with arceus
[deleted]
    Hope be fake. dialga and palkia last ones looks a horrible mod from a bizzarre game
        Theyre real. The game got dumped last night
    Real, they come from the game
    I looked at the first image, laughed and upvoted to be like 'haha, good meme'. Then I realised there were multiple images so I went and had another look. It hurt a bit to realise these are real. Why are they committed to making Typhlosion look worse and worse? Massive missed opportunity to finally show Samurott as it should look. I quite like horsie Palkia though. Ursaring evolution kinda nice too. New Weavile is disgusting I hate it. Ughhh, I was actually thinking of buying this game since I haven't played since USUM.
What happened to Palkia and Dialga?! Why do they look like that??? Why do they even need a regional form??
    I have a feeling it's like they're combined with Arceus or something similar. I could be wrong.
        I'm thinking Arceus just naturally made them in its own likeness, and as time went on they gradually changed. This is just them before that change, because Palkia almost looks like they're in the middle of whatever this new form is and their original form.
            I like this interpretation best.
        But come on... It could've looked so much better...
            Oh, I 100% agree. And we didn't need them. The above is more my thought on why they probably did it. Again, we definitely didn't need these. If they were going to set them up, they could've been better.
                Tbh i kinda like the look of Dialga, Palkia is messed up tho
        I actually think it’s palkia and dialga mid creation. Like arceus is in the process of making them and like all gods he starts with a shape in its own image
    It for sure looks like an Arceus combination. It just looks really bad.
Dialga and Palkia look awful, and what the hell did they do to Ursaring lmao
    This is the evolution of Ursaring
        Dual type Normal/Gravy
        Broke: being excited about ugly Ursaring evolution

Woke: Exited regular Ursaring has access to eviolite now
            That does raise the question, if this is a regional exclusive evolution, will the Eviolite still be an option in future versions if they don't have an evolution for Ursaring?
                They may probably introduce a system in the next game that will be like "of you bring us fossils or a record of this pokemon from your ancestors, we can bring it back how it was according to this DNA and make it exactly how your ancestors described!" 

Allowing you to transfer pokes from PKMN A.
            No held items in legends arceus, and the main meta is gonna still be in sword and shield sadly (gen 9 better include these mons in the dex via pokemon home)
    They leaned HARD into fat bear week and I’m DOWN for it
        Fat dog for midterms!
            #It's a bear dance!  

*screams garretly*
    Thankfully regular ursaring is still in the game
        It reminds me of the sea bear from SpongeBob
    Especially Palkia, wtf
Them legendaries 🤮
    Yeah, I don't really think fusion was that great of an idea for them, maybe a primal form would be better
        Especially since we kind of already had primal dialga in mystery dungeon
            Primal Dialga is a bit of a translation error - in Japanese it’s called Dark Dialga so just a corrupted Dialga.

But in my headcanon it’s still Primal Dialga because that’s way cooler and I fkn love PMD2.
            "Primal" Dialga is just a recolor, not nearly enough to make it a new form. Although looking at Alolan Dugtrio I wouldn't put it past them...
                You leave Alolan Dugtrio and his luscious locks alone
        Primal form would have looked leagues better than whatever this is
Lilligant….. I wanted you to get some attention…. But not like this….
    "Petilil digivolve to... Lillymon...I mean Hisuian Liligant"
    Do not want.

She's my favorite Pokemon by a long shot. This... thing... is not her.
    I don't mind the design, but what's up with those beady eyes? Immediately throws it into uncanny valley.
        They’re just lilligant’s regular eyes but turned upside down, maybe that’s why it looks off
            Oh wow, you're right! Amazing how simply flipping its eyes upside down turns Lilligant into an Ultra Beast.
    I kinda like it, but I understand the frustration
    Fans: lewd lilligant

GF: unthickens lilligant
        Looks like liligant without a “dress” to me.
Look how they massacred my [Typhlosion]
    I know, hopefully it looks better with the fire on
    Massacred? My man is stoned af
    Typhlosion would be cool if they’d simply let him be on fire all the time.
        [deleted]
            not the gen 1 poster boy not getting enough attention having two mega evolutions and a gigantimax form!

joking, typhlosion fan here just being sad
    You need to wait to see it in-game with its flames, apparently it’s flames make it look pretty sick.

Edit*

https://www.reddit.com/r/PokeLeaks/comments/s85hpu/hthyplosion_idle_animation_what_do_you_guys_think/

Yes I approve
        Hoping it has purple flames since I'm pretty sure it's fire and ghost
            The dots on its neck are purple so that implies they are. The dots on its neck being in front also implies the flames come out and warp around their neck as opposed to their back.
                Like a cape or like a scarf?
                    I’m guessing scarf, the dots are where the fire comes out and if you look you can see 3 dots on the front and then they go up to the sides, unclear if they are on the back or not.
                    If it’s a ghost I imagine the fire wraps around it’s face to make it look like a floating face engulfed in flame.
        There it is. Hope.
        Even without the fire, I legitimately like it. I just think the sleepy/high look makes it seem kinda cute.
            Right? I love typhlosion's original design, but this new one looks fun.
    Why Typhlosion looking like Toxtricity now?
Poor palkia... man already looked goofy and they made him a centaur
    An Armless centaur. They took his arms but kept his shoulders so he looks dumb as hell.
    Ah an amputee centaur
        An Amputaur.
            Dang now I can’t stop thinking about an alternate evolution to tyrannitar it’s electric type With Tesla coils on its back with some thing instead of its normal spikes Or maybe just some charged rocks with electricity Like in charge stone cave
What the fuck is the pokemon company smoking
    Same stuff hisuian typhlosion is on apparently
    Why don't you ask Hisuian Typhlosion?
    ask the junkie honey badger they are calling typhlosion
This is one of the only times I wish a leak is fake
most of these are absolutely painful to look at
    They also look like they're in pain.
        Dialga choking on an oversized toothpick LMAO
            Nah, somebody just shoved cofagrigus down his throat
Holy Jesus poor Palkia, what horrible things have they done to you....
    It got the Serperior treatment but worse
When the fan-made pokemon look better than the actual mons T_T
    This is why GF needs to start hiring these people who make fan arts as they are absolutely better than the designs GF make.
    It's been like this for at least two solid generations now
It’s time the pokemon community pulled a “Sonic, the Movie,” and demand a redesign on these characters.
    The Pokémon fanbase will defend any new release. I bet there is someone on Twitter right now saying how all the new designs are improvements.
        Im usually not very picky and just happy for a new pokemon game half the time but how the actual fuck can you defend half of these. I can understand liking a couple of these but some of them are just not improvements or downgrades of the original version. I genuinely like samurott, decidueye, basculegion (i believe thats what its called) and arcanine, but most of the other ones look like they got a 7 year old to draw fakemon and they made them real. I really hope this shit gets changed or just outright removed.
        And then calling us toxic for not liking the designs.
Ok now I know why they held off so long on showing more new mons…
    The first batch they showed actually looked pretty cool. I thought Hisuian Growlithe and Braviary as well as the evolutions for Basculin and Stantler looked great. 


So I don’t know what happened here.
        Conspiracy theory: They showed the good ones to hype up preorders, kept the bad designs until release.
            I mean it kinda makes sense but if they know they're bad, why make bad designs in the first place?
                Joke answer: they thought these were good designs. 

Realish answer: ran out of time maybe? Every Pokémon game feels more and more rushed.
                    Maybe.  The games definitely do feel rushed.  If I had to guess I'd say maybe the art team thought they were good designs for some reason but the marketing team realized which ones would land and which... kinda suck, so they showcased the good ones out front?  Idk.
    [deleted]
        the new samurott is basically a reskin of the one we had
        I like the Arcanine and Samurott (even though Samurott is basically just a reskin, but I like OG samurott), Electrode is kinda hard to mess up, and Decidueye is an ok pokemon but doesn't really make sense as a Dartrix evo, but the rest are pretty terrible yeah.
        It depresses me that they managed to make Lilligant even more bland and boring.
        Decidueye looks pretty cool.  But other than that...holy crap, they suck.  Sneasel looks fine, but that's easy because Sneasel has always looked cool.  Whatever that evolution is sucks, though.
    They themselves were not proud of their own work
most of these are pretty awful imo
    The technical term would be garbagio. Jfc that new weavile is just fucking awful. The 3d sprites are doing them no favours tho tbf
        It’s just sneasel but longer :’(
SNEASEL NOOOOO
    weavile looks like the weasel from the suicide squad movie
    Look at how they massacred my boy...
lot's of them look really depressive.
What the fluck are these?! 😳
    Yes in opinion most of these suck and only a few are likeable like the new starter evolutions are fine,Arcanine,Goodra are acceptable for me.
        I think the Ursaring is OK, if somehow a bit excessive. I've been wanting a four legged bear pokemon for a bit now, and while I would've preferred it as a grass type starter I'll take this I suppose
Since Voltorb is basically a seed, it should’ve grown into something more plant-like and completely different when evolving. Feels like they revealed all the best designs early when promoting the game.
    So many people were coming up with cool unique designs for the new electrode trying to predict it but it just ended up being a wooden version 😂😂😂
They look like fakemon… this game is going going to the moon or going to bust
    The whole game is a glorified wild area. 

The town, despite being the main hub, looks like it is the most empty town to ever exist. 

Npcs still move like they are on a gameboy.

Pokemon still have the same models/move animations from XnY. 

BUT CRAFTING GUYS CRAFTING!!!!!
Honestly samurott is kinda an improvement it looks more like an evil Samuri
    Isn’t it dark type now too? Makes sense
        Water dark so we basically have a slower sharpedo with probably higher attack
    I think it's a lazy design. They just took Samurott, bent its horns a bit, and slapped on some wavy lines around its armour. It doesn't feel like a new design in the same way that the other two do. I really like Oshawott and Samurott normally and I was hoping to take them through this adventure, but they did my boy dirty.
        Yah honestly I think the only reason that Samurott seems to be the most popular starter choice in this thread is because it barely changed.
Wow, I genuinely hate most of the new designs. I feel bad as a fan. Hopefully the gameplay is fun.
    Yeah I don’t think I’ll be using any new variants aside from Samurott and *maybe* Zoroark
        Man does Samurott even count? It's got different colored shells and that's about it.
        They didn’t really even change Samurott’s design, they just gave it new colors. They should have made it a bipedal like it should have been originally
Poor Palkia, lost both of it's arms. I hope mummy arceus takes very good care of him.


Dialga now has throat cancer, should have laid off the cigarette.
I wish they would’ve gotten more creative with the typhlosipn and samurott… decidueye is the only one I think is cool cause they actually strayed away from the original design a little more
    Decidueye looks like a straw hat ronin, I like it. Wish the cloak were longer but it's alright as is
    Samurott literally looks like a palette swap
I feel like This will be an unpopular opinion but most of these variants look kinda bad imo might be the quality of the images tho (except for dialga/palkia they look like they were made in spore)
    Yeah that hasn’t been an unpopular opinion today
        Right? How the hell would they think their opinion is unpopular? Most of these look terrible. I’ll have to wait to see them in-game before I change my mind.
            Go to r/pokeleaks majority of people over there think lighting will change the core designs of these. It's insane
                I think seeing them moving in game has the chance to make some of them look better, but it can only do so much.
    I think Dialga and Palkia are supposed to look like kirins? Still pretty poor execution tho.

Actually I guess they’re supposed to look like arceus, who I think is based on kirin anyways so whatever.
        From the leaks they're supposedly fused with Arceus, and retain their "normal" forms when not fused
    Yeah, not that big of a fan of most of them, the only one I really like is goodra
        Palkia just looks unfinished imo they keep his shoulder things but take away his arms? Lol
            It feels like they tried to make him a centaur, but then forgot what centaurs looked like. Dialga’s looks more natural because he was already that shape.
                And then they added that big cannon to his neck, that just looks wrong in my opinion.
                    Think it’s supposed to be his chest plate or something. Either that or it’s legitimately a cannon lmao.
            I think that's the point. Look like failed fusions with arceus or something
                Still poor execution. 

Reminds me of the Sw/Sh fossils. I know what they were going for, but I don’t feel they pull it off.
        I love the new Decidueye, looks like a samurai wearing a straw coat and hat (I guess not exactly a samurai, that'd be Samurott, but you know what I mean)
            Decidueye is the only starter that looks good here. Samurott looks like a reskin and Typhlosion looks… *special.*

Edit: just saw the leaked footage and yes, typhlosion looks a lot better with the fire
                I read that Typhlosion is going to be Fire/Ghost type so I can see the style they're going for with it. And as usual, Typhlosion without the flames looks very bad, so I wouldn't judge this version too hard.
    Almost everyone is ok to OOF. They took Pakia’s fucking arms and it looks so bad!
    Nah you captured my sentiment exactly. I’ve never been more offended. Poor design by 90% of these.
What in the my little pony is going on with palkia 😭
    Palkia became a horse
        And learned that friendship isn’t always magic.
Do we know if James Turner is the design lead on this game? Just need to know whether my dislike for his designs just turned into absolute disgust or if there’s someone else I should be directing that at.
Please Nintendo, take the Pokémon main games away from Game Freak’s hands right now
    Shouldn't we be asking the Pokemon Company instead of Nintendo? I am not sure which one has higher authority on Pokemon designs.
        [deleted]
    Seriously, this is so embarrassing
I don’t want to be negative but i don’t like any of these designs save for Samurott. Am i crazy for thinking they dropped the ball here?
    Decidueye and Arcanine aren’t bad. But uh…yeah. A lot of these aren’t great.
    No you’re not. The majority of them suck. Dialga has a neck laser? Wtf???
        He looks like we caught him in the middle of swallowing a Lego.
    Nah they absolutely dropped the ball.
I am hoping the Palkia and Dialga forms are closer to primal forms instead of fusions. It would make sense with them being the gods of the pokemon universe and it plays on the whole, "created them in his own image" line. I know this is part of a Christian creation story and not the Japanese creation story like they were originally created as, but pokemon has never shied away from mixing mythologies.
They really game my boi sneasel and weavile the alolan meowth treatment
    Tbh, I prefer these over the Hisuan Lilligant.

They somehow managed to make fricking Lilligant more boring.
        It looks like its supposed to be a second evolution. Its just so bland. I love lilligant, but that form is just upseting. I also just notice the sneasel evo has near the same lazy eyes as alolan persian.
    It's not Weavile, it's a new pokemon.

Hisuian Sneasel is poison/fighting with a new evolution.
        Using the type of croagunk and giving it to sneasel is cool. Turning sneasel into the love child of toxicroak and gigantimax meowth is a freaking sin.
        Sneasler. It’s a downgrade in every way lol
        Seriously? Not ice/poison? Well, it's gamefreak so I should expect to be let down.
Thanks, I hate it. If someone posted these as their fakemon ideas there would be 5 upvotes and 20 comments.
quilfish evo looks like a splatoon enemy
is typhlosion ok
    no. Seeing all the attention charizard and blaziken gets made him depressed.
It feels like GameFreak was hiding these because they’re horrible looking. Plus now i fear how the games are going to perform
    Agreed, They definitely chose the better ones to show off in trailers
The weather Pokémon looks like a bad take on a heartless boss
    Its so hideous that I almost felt like it was put there to brace me for Centaur Palkia, like it was trying to ease me into the disgusting a bit.
Game freak is trying to kill the franchise
    Nah man, they are just milking the fuck out of it rn.
        Both, both is unfortunately correct
        [deleted]
Most of these are really... REALLY bad... i kind of like blue stripe basculegion and decidueye but that's it.
    I really hope they look better in game cuz I agree
I really dislike most of them. The only ones that are decent are Samurott and Arcanine
    At least Hisuian Zoroark is an improvement
Palkia looks atrocious, as does most of these. 

The only ones I outright like are Samurott and Arcanine. The ones I think are alright are Decidueye, Sneasel (not Weavile), Basculeigon and Dialga.
    I was with you until Dialga
        Maybe I think that because Dialga looks so much better than Palkia, but that’s admittedly a very low bar to clear.
I can see why they didn't tease a lot of these lmao
Holy shit, what happened to dialga and palkia, they look like they decided to dress up like dad but instead of just clothes they took a do-your-own surgery kit on themselves
Their more mangled then my sentences when auto correct is done with them
Somebody at gamefreak was smoking a fat rock designing these lol
These are such a miss these are outrageous they need some of these street artist to go in there and take jobs these designs terrible
I think the last two are just errors lol
Bro why did they had to give liligant such a bad design, she was a cute dancer, now she looks like a stick figure but with some details. God what a awful design.
I'm sorry but almost all of them look awful
These palkia and dialga are the ugliest shit game freak has ever made. 

I don't care if they make sense in the end or if they're supposed to resemble arceus, they're just atrocious.
Still waiting to discover if we can cancel evolutions. That will determine which starter I pick. I just want Dewott, that's all!
    Yes. Evolution is no longer automatic and you can choose to evolve your Pokémon when they meet the right conditions.
Can someone check in on game freak and make sure they’re ok?
    they haven’t been okay for a long time
palkia looking...uhhh...randomized?

for real though it hurts seeing how bad the team is at making new pokemon and now even variants are trash. makes me wish the fakemon i see were actually real bc some of them are brilliant.
Yikes. As an organization Game Freak should feel embarrassed.
Typhlosion looks cute, Samurott didn't change at all lmfao, he just looks edgier, shame they didn't make him a actual samurai (even though people would complain anyways because muh humanoid), still like Samurott's design anyways so it's whatever for me, Decidueye changed the most here, so much that he looks weird, but that's just me, Arcanine is still a fluffy boyo, I'll gladly take it, I kinda like that design of the force of nature dude (no idea which one it is, probably Landorus?), the rest are either lazy designs or decent



Wait what the fuck have they done to you Palkia???
The growlith/arcanine, Zorua/Zoroark, and Braviary are the only new forms I would ever touch with a 10 ft pole. Would love to see typhlosion with flames since he alway has looked bad without them, so he might get a pass.
Look how they massacred my palkia
typholsion looks like he just smoked a ton of weed
    Why do you think there is no chicorita?
r/cursedimages
In my opinion some look kinda neat but nothing to really get excited about. However, Palkia looks like it mutated into a My Little Pony wannabe.
    Palkia learned that friendship isn’t magic.
These look like shit
I know that pokemon has been declining with their designs but what the f did they do to the legendaries holy shit they are ugly. Why does the palkia form loose arms and dialga have a fucking ulgy ass naked looking neck laser. 

They could have kept it at the chest to make that less ugly but no lets pu in in the neck. 

Dude looks like squidward when he choked on a fork.
I've never seen so many Pokemon that I feel are downright hideous. Maybe it's for the best, they went extinct?
Wow. I hate them lol
Bro that Goodra isn’t a hisui form, he legit has a tumor
U forgot regular hisuian quilfish (you showed the evo) you got pretty much everything else though
Horse palkia

Horse palkia
Please please please tell me this is fake. Oh my god please be fake
    It's real. I'm so sorry.
is that Goomy or the middle evolution? Either way I love it, it looks like one of those plastic gum containers from the 2000's
    Goomy just has its regular form, sligoo and goodra get the new forms
Quilfish finally has an evolution
    But at what cost?
Dialga looks like Squidward when he choked on a fork
What a bunch of shitty looking monsters
The sad state of pokemon in 2022
why are they all so hideous, jesus christ
These look like shit. And I liked gen 5 designs.
These designs really look like middle school fan art to me.
every year is more disappointing than the last for pokemon.
They shoulda stopped at 900 cause…
It looks like they're fused with Arceus, Kyurem style
    I understand the lore reasons for  Kyurem and Necrozma, but why would Arceus fuse with his own creations?
        I assume that's what the game will be about, but my guess is that it's forced to by the humans
            If that's the case I will instantly forgive these atrocious designs, as there are supposed to look absolutely horrible
                Bruh they got a gigalith stuck in dialga's throat
                    Its like that squidward choking on a fork meme
            How would they be forced, in BW I understand it they had the technology. But this game is set 2000(?) years ago so like how?
         "Well, first of all, through God all things are possible, so jot that down."
        Alabama joke.
        My guess is that it isn't fused, but rather purified

God made us in his image, Arceus made Palkia and Dialga in his image, and over time they lost some of their power
    I don't like the movement twords more and more legendaries doing this. It feels like it takes away from Kyurem's whole shtick.
        But kyurems whole thing is that it's still incomplete even after it fuses 
The other pokemon are complete before they fuse 
So if we get a gen5 remake or a legend for the gen 5 region  we will probably get yet another form
            I want to see the Original Dragon Pokemon so bad.
                Don’t know why we ain’t got a game based on it yet and have that as the legendary, baffled.
                    Maybe we'll get it in a future Unova based legends game
                        Shit, that's a great idea. It could follow the original conflict between truth and ideals! ~~And maybe your choice between the two will actually affect the story!~~
                            Pokemon Legends Kyurem would kick ass. I'd play that
                        Man imagine a legebds game based on kalos. On what happened 3000 yrs ago. And the adventure of zygarde and that hero greninja who save the entire kalos region from shambles.
its one with arceus now
    Still, they messed dialga and palkia big time
        I don't dislike the new form...but I think palkia needs arms to balance out
            Yeah Palkia could've looked alright. His design already resembles a gladiator, so some arms and he would've been a cool celestial centaur.  
Dialga on the other hand...
        I think as long as the narrative makes sense for the change in design then I'll be happy with it. At least this explains why there was no new form in BDSP
            Probably will have something to do with the weird statue that represented both of them in the OG diamond and pearl.
                Yeah they look a lot like the eterna (or rockveil i don't remember) statue
    I think it's actually the opposite, they will fuse to make arceus. It's more lore accurate
        If true, that'd be a kind of neat retcon. Dialga seems to have more Arceus elements than the other.

Doesn’t change the fact that Palkia looks like an eldritch horror though.
            Well not necessarily dialga has the cross and palkia has the outer rings
Why the fuck is it a horse

Why a fucking horse
    I think it's meant to be Arceus' torso
    It's nnot even a horse it's like

armless centaur
I’m gonna have to be blunt. The new Dialga and Palkia are bar non, not gonna argue otherwise, the most fucking ugly Pokémon ever created. It’s like that one deformed image of garfield before his humanity was restored.

        Typhlosion looks drugged out of his mind
            Players: We want Typhlosion to be burning again  
Gamefreak: Well he will be blazing alright
                if you didn't see cyndaquil has his fire on all the time again, this is the model without the in game visual effects
                Ngl I kinda love stoned Typhlosion. Dude needed to chill a little, and now he can.
            I think it's hilarious and I'm picking him. Highphlosion is great.
                Higpholsion and tyedye Weedville are 100% on my team. Gonna make a wook themed team for this run hahaha.
                “Highphlosion” is genius and definitely the nickname I’ll be picking. Rowlet is one of my all-time favourite across the generations, but I might have to go cindaquil just for that last form.
                Highphlosion… shit that’s good.
                I’d smoke that.
            He took one look at what they did to Palkia and Dialga and had to tranq the shit out of him.
        No, don't tell me that's supposed to be typhlosion. Stop. ☠️
        Looks like drowzee
        I'm pretty sure Typhlosion (and others shown here) will look better when animated. and I think it's a safe guess that Typhlosion is fire/ghost and will have those purple wisp flames around him when animated and he'll look much better.
    Palkia straight up has nipples on his shoulders, the Arceus ring looks like plastic, and the lower body is a mush of play dough.
    Sword and Shield fossil Pokémon would like to have a word.
        They at least had an excuse, since their inspirations were chimera fossils made out of many different animals to draw attention or just because they didn't know any better
Evolution (or lack thereof)
He looks so fucking stupid and I’m not gonna act like he doesn’t
MADE IN HEAVEN
It is exactly like the statue in the 2nd gym's city in Pearl/Diamond!
It laughs until Game Freak decides that Giratina needs a Hisui form too and they give it a dildo coming out of its head
    This would spawn so much rule 34.

    Bad dragon
Dawn: Hey Giratina how come you have two forms, but Dialga and Palkia have only one?

Giratina: (rips open a portal from laughing so hard)
I even kind of like Dialga. It's okay.

Palkia, on the other hand, looks like someone put a poodle through the worst makeup routine in Sinnoh
Damn this needs to be higher up.

Edit. 

You beautiful redditors you did it, you really did it.
Ed..ward..
    *small child fused with dog to create abomination*

Scar: yep its gamer time 😎
        I’m gonna do what’s called a “pro gamer move”
        Scar: “Hey kid. High five—TOOSLOW—“

***BOOM***
    Oh god, I can't relive that moment, not again
    Ptsd intensifies
    No. Just no. Not again.
    Too soon
Palkia looks better than whatever is coming out of Dialga’s neck
    He swallowed a giant water bottle; don't question it.
        He thought the only way to beat Palkia was to become the water bottle 🧐 steel/dragon/water..bottle
Kill…me……
[look at what they did to my boy](https://imgur.com/MXy4AW0)
    Man the amount of effort you must have put into making this, fair play, that's hilarious
        I wish I could draw this well. I just took it from /v/.
Here draw a circle!
    That’s an oval it has to be a circle!!!
        “What’d I do that time??”
“I don’t know,I guess he just doesn’t like you!”
            “Pretend to be someone else!”
        This circle would never protect us against a sea rhinosarus.
            Good thing we're all wearing our anti-sea rhinoceros underwear! Haha right Squidward?
        Cubed. Sliced is fine.
Omg, I can totally see the Sea Bear in it now!
Because he is now a "Full Moon" Bear, drawing from his name coming from the Ursa constellations
Why does he look so ashamed. Why do all these Pokemon look like they are suffering from existential dread?
    Mirroring the qualities of the target audience is sometimes an excellent way to attract consumers. Maybe it’s because many of us are suffering from existential dread.
 A sea bear? You mean like the ones that... *don't exist?*
It's it's evolution. It has ascended and became Freddy Fatbear
Tbh, I like it. I’ve always liked Ursaring, but it always looked more like a man-in-a-bear-suit than an actual bear. The humped shoulders and quadrupedalism makes it look more like the actual animal.


I bet they wanted to give Ursaring a more natural-looking design reminiscent of the [brown bears that live in Hokkaido](https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5189/5585318214_e1059162a4_b.jpg) - Hokkaido being the basis behind Sinnoh and Hesui.
I thought I needed one when I saw it, but now I fucking need one and to nickname it Sea Bear
i wonder if he will attract a sea rhydon attack
I'm wondering if he actually does have arms, they're just made using some special effect that can only be shown when animated.
    [removed]
I like to imagine they’re just really tiny hands holding shields.
    *NOBODY LOOK!*

*NOBODY LOOK*
Palkia looks like some paleontologist made a bad sketch of what an animal might look like based on an incomplete skeleton.
Ursaring lost his reason to live, while Typhlosion realized his was marijuana
    Weavile came to the same conclusion
        In this region, Sneasel evolves into

A

S

L
            Sneasonal Depression
        Weedvile
    I demand justice for typhlosion
        It will likely have purple ghostly flames so that’s cool
    Typhlosion just be chilling in a cloud of smoke.
And goodra looks like it’s having an existential crisis
    I would too if I came out of the design room dripping with white goo.
Considering a lot of the species go extinct, I would say they have a right to be depressed
    You know what, that is fair
I hate this trend with the bored half opened eyes design. They never look good on any Pokémon
There’s a reason most of them are extinct..
>I'm wondering if he actually does have arms, they're just made using some special effect that can only be shown when animated.

Nah man, it's SCP Foundation.
[deleted]
*Gets trampled*
I'm more terrified of tall sneasel
    Look how they massacred my boy...
You ever fight a horse?

You'll lose, buddy.
It's a new force of nature like thunderous, tornadus and landorous
    Damn didn’t know they made Bruxish into a force of nature
        It has a weird semblance to Ghirahim to me.
            Or the love child of Him from Powerpuff Girls and Ghirahim. 

"Himahim"
                Owner of the Himsdale Himmadome?
    What is the typing?
        It is confirmed Fairy/Flying
            So then love is a force of nature? I kind of hope it's name isn't Lovurus..
                It’s called Enamorus
        Looks like fairy flying

Togekiss PTSD
        I don't think it's been stated yet, but given the colouration, I'd presume Fairy.
    It's the pokemon that's going to stop the Mongols from invading
    Whatever it is, whoever designed it should be fired

From a cannon
I forget if the name already leaked but its a new addition to the Forces of Nature (Thundurus/Tornadus/Landorus).
    I just realized that Nintendo just made the fourth Chinese Heavenly Beast. We currently have This new one as the Black Turtle of the North, Thunderus as the Azure dragon of the East, Tornadus as the Vermilion Bird of the South, and Landorus as the White Tiger of the West. Next we may see the Golden Kirin of the Center.
        I think Arceus is supposed to be based on a kirin
            And Mt Coronet/Spear Pillar are in the center
            Holy shit this changes everything

Fimfiction prepare yourselves for I am armed with more knowledge
            Shiny Arceus is also golden.
Force of Nature, the force of love, covers the snake turtle from 4 animal gods that the genies are based on.
    RIP the force of love is dead in present day Pokémon.
        I blame humanity for that one.

Just look at what happened to these pokemon:

Corsola -> galarian Corsola

Zorua -> hisuian zorua

hisuian voltorb -> voltorb
            (Ir)regular reminder of Togekiss' PokéDex entry:

> It will never appear where there is strife. Its sightings have become rare recently.
                What a oddly haunting pokedex entry, it's such a simple one too. What the fuck was going on with the guy who wrote that
                >ok at what happened to these pokemon:  
>  
>Corsola -> galarian Corsola

imagine if a few generation later togekiss is considered a mythical
It’s Him.
    My thoughts exactly!

Like messed up Digimon evolutions halfway through digivolving
    [deleted]
        Skullgreymon be like
    Honestly Lilligant reminds me a lot of Lilamon, just inverting colors
they look like an AI tried to recreate Palkia based off of only 10 blurry photos
    And two of those blurry photos were actually of missingno
Dialga doesn't even have feet
    Fucking toasters for arms
Dialga looks alright, but Palkia... What the hell happened here?
    Mistakes were made.
    How does Dialga look alright? He looks like he swallowed an oversized brolen fidget spinner
    Still think Primal Dialga looks better.
    dialga does NOT look alright, the fuck??? look at his neck it’s like that scene where squidward chokes on a fork 


look at his feet what the fuck it’s like his toes are on pizza tables
Dialga looks like it swallowed a water bottle and it got stuck half way down
These are just the base models so for all we know they have special animations or textures to them that make them look better. I hope...

Cause where are Palkia's arms???
    Gone, reduced to atoms
Honestly lore wise that probably accurate. Like Arceus possesses them but it messed up halfway.
I too was looking for a shelled Gastrodon. Idk why they decided to give the shell to goodra instead!
    Maybe Gastrodon split off from the Goodra line? After all, one's pink and one's blue; meanwhile, Goodra is lavender.
        This is the perfect example of two intrests I love falling together perfectly: Pokemon and speculative biology/evolution.
    What if we got a fossil ancestor that connects goomy, shellos, and slugma?
that weezing entry has been around in similar phrasing since original gen 4 iirc
    Oh ok. I've never noticed it before for some reason.
        Could be cool if Weezing's shiny had a alternate model with three. I always thought it was a missed opportunity. If a dex entry mentions a rare variant it should be referenced in the shiny.
            Crystal onyx
This game is not set in “ancient times”, it’s like the 1800s.
    I realize that but was wondering and kind of hoping that supposed "older forms" of pokemon would be present or included. Another thing I've been speculating on is fossil mons and possibly an older form of it being available in game that way because I can't really see them just completely removing fossil pokemon especially Cranidos and Shieldon completely from the game.

 I am also curious about the area around where Floaroma is located and if the Shaymin myth will be explored based off of the dialogue of an npc saying nothing would grow there until someone expressed graditude causing the area to burst into bloom. I'm remembering this off the top of my head so sorry if I don't have the exact wording.
putting the freak in gamefreak
[deleted]
    people were asking for more gender variants.
    THAT IS FLUFF-
        Can we NOT have another Pokkèn Blaziken incident?
Seems tied to how we got the models. I wouldnt freak out on most of em just yet

Exception being palkia, Jesus christ something went wrong there
Typhosion hit the blunt to hard
I kinda like Decidueye but the rest of them are kind of ehhh. Decidueye reminds me of the straw hat ronin from Ghost of Tsushima
Dialga: I AM NO LONGER HORSE!
Looks like Dialga has something stuck in his throat.
    He swallowed his pride
[deleted]
    wait so no joke this… this is real? Holy fucking shit these designs are atrocious.
Dialga looks okay I guess but palkia looks so goofy
    After looking at them again, I can say that Dialga isn't that bad (despite the difference in the shape of the legs), but Palkia is still so... unnatural.

The shoulders are what I can't stand

Why take a dragon and turn it into a centaur without arms?
        the dialgia one just looks more …. sharp i guess. not the worst thing ever and i could see it looking badass in game. however…. palkia i cannot wrap my head around what it could possibly look like in game to make this design cool. and this comes from someone who much rather prefers palkia over dialgia in the original games.
I saw a post today that said "Lando-T is its own biggest check" and i nearly lost it
    This comment is being overwritten in protest of Reddit's CEO spez (Steve Huffman) being a piece of shit and killing 3rd party apps.
        Wasn't Klefki also a big abuser of all three of those things? I actually remember Klefki being more overt considering that was its primary niche.

For Lando-T though, it does pretty much every single role, and does them well. If you're struggling to think of something to fill out your team, the answer is probably Lando-T. Looking at the Pikalytics OU usage stats, it has a **52.75%** usage. That is *insane*. The next highest is Ferrothorn at 26.81%.
            I used to run swagkey and mega kanga in gen 5 3v3s and it was amazing. Swagger, T-wave, foul play on klefki and scrappy return/EQ/PUP/Shadow Claw for kanga. Always loved not using mega first turn and getting the PUP into their ghost type because I was still scrappy.
Finally they got their evolution. It was scrapped, but now it comes in a new look with the variants.
    No, not finaly. My boy qwilfish just got fucked by this thing. Now he will be even more forgoten and everyone will use hisuian form. Why couldnt they just give johto qwilfish evolution like they did with stantler?
        Actually, quilfish can run an eviolite now so its usage is going to skyrocket
            Actually he can not, only hisuian Qwilfish can, old water poison still cant
                Oh shoot, I didn’t think we were getting one. Hopefully it has similar stats and keeps intimidate and swift swim.
                It doesn't look like there will be a Hisuian Qwilfish if it isn't in this leak. There isn't an Alolan Cubone that evolves into Alolan Marowak. If regular Qwilfish is the one that evolves into this new form then it'll basically just be like any other cross gen evolution and the eviolite will work.
[deleted]
    Yeah, t-spikes and intimidate and stab on grass types is great.
It hung out with inteleon too much
I'm getting flashbacks from Alolan Persian
    What about the Meowth Galar evolution?
        And I _almost_ forgot about it until you brought it up
Not Weavile but a new evo
    Makes sense but still not a fan of slender sneasel
Slender Sneasel isn't real, Slender Sneasel can't hurt me...
I'm just staring at it thinking "was this necessary?"

It still looks like an ice type, and it looks worse than normal Sneasel and Weavile.
Yeah this is the one that made me audibly say “what have they done?” hahahaha!
I'm so tired of humanoids Mons getting more humanoid every time.
It looks like some furry on Deviantart wanted to make them more fuckable for them.
It's a FNaF OC now
I was hype when I heard of a new Sneasel Regional form/Evo, but… I may just keep H-Sneasel as Sneasel. It should have passable stats for in-game.
srsly, why would you change an alrady perfect weavile?
It’s name is fucking Sneasler lmao
It’s called Sneasler and I can’t stop laughing at it
Sneasel is an all time favorite for me, but I’ve never been satisfied with weavile. Gamefreak responded by saying “it could be worse”.
They know they’re going extinct
    wait I didn't even think about this, all these forms are doomed to die and go extinct lmfao
        And yet, we'll probably have a way to transfer them to mainline games.

"I love you Arcanine. Now I'm gonna put you in a pokeball time capsule and send you 200 years into the future! Byeee!"
            evil Pokémon origin story. Trapped alone for 200 years by trainer
                Oof that is harsh. I hope they find a one-way time portal instead. Dialga is the god of time, after all. Could make a little wormhole
                Didn’t something like that happen to a Lucario in that one movie
        It's okay. If they get fossilized they can be miraculously brought back to life for some reason.
            “Life, uh, finds a way.”
            Why didn’t I think of this as a reason to have these Pokémon in future games? This whole time I’ve been thinking these new Hisuian Pokémon are cool but I haven’t been able to get super excited about them because they won’t be in the meta in the future. But if they decide they want to bring back some of these Pokémon, they totally could in the form of fossils. And actually, there could totally be a secluded area of a region in a future game that is a home to ancient Hisuian Growlithe. Totally possible to do tbh
    Thank god they did in the current Pokémon timeline. If I had to use that Hisuian typhlosion in the original/remake johto games I would’ve dropped Pokémon a long time ago
        Mf only knows one move, blaze
Word on the street is that the models being passed around are of particularly low quality, which happens when you have a leak and some one quickly does a rip of all of the models. Hopefully we'll either get to see them in action/ better quality soon because apparently Typhlosion actually looks cool with the flame effect and we just haven't seen it yet.
    Of all the designs leaked today, I actually kind of like the more subdued look Typhlosion has. I'm very excited to see its flames, of course, but it'll be nice to start with a Ghost/Fire starter. I've been wanting to play with a ghost team from the start for ages(I missed out on Alola).
        Typhlosion is Ghost/Fire?
            That’s the big rumor, yeah
Just look at fucking magikarp’s 3D ripped design, it looks terrible compared to what we actually get in game.
They literally just put a shell on the boy. Like, it *works,* but it doesn’t work because it’s a *new* design - it’s the equivalent of putting a hat on Pikachu.
    Well I’m guessing they did that to go from slug to snail
Are we sure it’s not Dragon Bug type since that made it part snail?
    Earlier leaks said Dragon/Steel and they've been pretty spot on with what was leaked today.
    snails aren't bugs they're mollusks which includes clams, oysters, octopus, and squid
    Snails aren't really bugs tho. They are Mollusks like squids and octopi.
I liked all 3 starters and thought I would pick fire this time. But upon seeing the final forms rowlet is the only one I still like
    typhlosion is still a wild card, no flames yet
        Typhlosion looks like it just wants a hug
            Looks high af
        This. We still haven’t seen it with flames on.
            i hate that typhlosion doesnt have constant flames ever since the 3d swap. one of the coolest sprites reduced to a smooth noodle boy.
                If we look the cyndaquil model has constant flames but this model just has them off it will probably have constant flames as well
                If you look at previews and leaked footage, Cyndaquil has flames a good portion of the time. They’re not a part of the model, but rather seem to be some sort of particle effect. It’s totally possible Typhlosion will have flames (or ghost wisps or whatever) virtually all of the time. But that won’t come across in a still render likely just pulled from the obj file
                I like this one’s mellow mood already, and also the flames look like they’ll stay on because Cyndaquil has them all the time.
That decidueye form looks really good
They're definitely some kind of Dialga and Palkia mixed with Arceus designs a la Kyurem, and the leaks have confirmed >!Time travel to explain away tech in the region, so the mixes are probably man made mistakes!<
They look like artificially fusions of them with arceus
Hope be fake. dialga and palkia last ones looks a horrible mod from a bizzarre game
    Theyre real. The game got dumped last night
Real, they come from the game
I looked at the first image, laughed and upvoted to be like 'haha, good meme'. Then I realised there were multiple images so I went and had another look. It hurt a bit to realise these are real. Why are they committed to making Typhlosion look worse and worse? Massive missed opportunity to finally show Samurott as it should look. I quite like horsie Palkia though. Ursaring evolution kinda nice too. New Weavile is disgusting I hate it. Ughhh, I was actually thinking of buying this game since I haven't played since USUM.
I have a feeling it's like they're combined with Arceus or something similar. I could be wrong.
    I'm thinking Arceus just naturally made them in its own likeness, and as time went on they gradually changed. This is just them before that change, because Palkia almost looks like they're in the middle of whatever this new form is and their original form.
        I like this interpretation best.
    But come on... It could've looked so much better...
        Oh, I 100% agree. And we didn't need them. The above is more my thought on why they probably did it. Again, we definitely didn't need these. If they were going to set them up, they could've been better.
            Tbh i kinda like the look of Dialga, Palkia is messed up tho
    I actually think it’s palkia and dialga mid creation. Like arceus is in the process of making them and like all gods he starts with a shape in its own image
It for sure looks like an Arceus combination. It just looks really bad.
This is the evolution of Ursaring
    Dual type Normal/Gravy
    Broke: being excited about ugly Ursaring evolution

Woke: Exited regular Ursaring has access to eviolite now
        That does raise the question, if this is a regional exclusive evolution, will the Eviolite still be an option in future versions if they don't have an evolution for Ursaring?
            They may probably introduce a system in the next game that will be like "of you bring us fossils or a record of this pokemon from your ancestors, we can bring it back how it was according to this DNA and make it exactly how your ancestors described!" 

Allowing you to transfer pokes from PKMN A.
        No held items in legends arceus, and the main meta is gonna still be in sword and shield sadly (gen 9 better include these mons in the dex via pokemon home)
They leaned HARD into fat bear week and I’m DOWN for it
    Fat dog for midterms!
        #It's a bear dance!  

*screams garretly*
Thankfully regular ursaring is still in the game
    It reminds me of the sea bear from SpongeBob
Especially Palkia, wtf
Yeah, I don't really think fusion was that great of an idea for them, maybe a primal form would be better
    Especially since we kind of already had primal dialga in mystery dungeon
        Primal Dialga is a bit of a translation error - in Japanese it’s called Dark Dialga so just a corrupted Dialga.

But in my headcanon it’s still Primal Dialga because that’s way cooler and I fkn love PMD2.
        "Primal" Dialga is just a recolor, not nearly enough to make it a new form. Although looking at Alolan Dugtrio I wouldn't put it past them...
            You leave Alolan Dugtrio and his luscious locks alone
    Primal form would have looked leagues better than whatever this is
"Petilil digivolve to... Lillymon...I mean Hisuian Liligant"
Do not want.

She's my favorite Pokemon by a long shot. This... thing... is not her.
I don't mind the design, but what's up with those beady eyes? Immediately throws it into uncanny valley.
    They’re just lilligant’s regular eyes but turned upside down, maybe that’s why it looks off
        Oh wow, you're right! Amazing how simply flipping its eyes upside down turns Lilligant into an Ultra Beast.
I kinda like it, but I understand the frustration
Fans: lewd lilligant

GF: unthickens lilligant
    Looks like liligant without a “dress” to me.
I know, hopefully it looks better with the fire on
Massacred? My man is stoned af
Typhlosion would be cool if they’d simply let him be on fire all the time.
    [deleted]
        not the gen 1 poster boy not getting enough attention having two mega evolutions and a gigantimax form!

joking, typhlosion fan here just being sad
You need to wait to see it in-game with its flames, apparently it’s flames make it look pretty sick.

Edit*

https://www.reddit.com/r/PokeLeaks/comments/s85hpu/hthyplosion_idle_animation_what_do_you_guys_think/

Yes I approve
    Hoping it has purple flames since I'm pretty sure it's fire and ghost
        The dots on its neck are purple so that implies they are. The dots on its neck being in front also implies the flames come out and warp around their neck as opposed to their back.
            Like a cape or like a scarf?
                I’m guessing scarf, the dots are where the fire comes out and if you look you can see 3 dots on the front and then they go up to the sides, unclear if they are on the back or not.
                If it’s a ghost I imagine the fire wraps around it’s face to make it look like a floating face engulfed in flame.
    There it is. Hope.
    Even without the fire, I legitimately like it. I just think the sleepy/high look makes it seem kinda cute.
        Right? I love typhlosion's original design, but this new one looks fun.
Why Typhlosion looking like Toxtricity now?
An Armless centaur. They took his arms but kept his shoulders so he looks dumb as hell.
Ah an amputee centaur
    An Amputaur.
        Dang now I can’t stop thinking about an alternate evolution to tyrannitar it’s electric type With Tesla coils on its back with some thing instead of its normal spikes Or maybe just some charged rocks with electricity Like in charge stone cave
Same stuff hisuian typhlosion is on apparently
Why don't you ask Hisuian Typhlosion?
ask the junkie honey badger they are calling typhlosion
They also look like they're in pain.
    Dialga choking on an oversized toothpick LMAO
        Nah, somebody just shoved cofagrigus down his throat
It got the Serperior treatment but worse
This is why GF needs to start hiring these people who make fan arts as they are absolutely better than the designs GF make.
It's been like this for at least two solid generations now
The Pokémon fanbase will defend any new release. I bet there is someone on Twitter right now saying how all the new designs are improvements.
    Im usually not very picky and just happy for a new pokemon game half the time but how the actual fuck can you defend half of these. I can understand liking a couple of these but some of them are just not improvements or downgrades of the original version. I genuinely like samurott, decidueye, basculegion (i believe thats what its called) and arcanine, but most of the other ones look like they got a 7 year old to draw fakemon and they made them real. I really hope this shit gets changed or just outright removed.
    And then calling us toxic for not liking the designs.
The first batch they showed actually looked pretty cool. I thought Hisuian Growlithe and Braviary as well as the evolutions for Basculin and Stantler looked great. 


So I don’t know what happened here.
    Conspiracy theory: They showed the good ones to hype up preorders, kept the bad designs until release.
        I mean it kinda makes sense but if they know they're bad, why make bad designs in the first place?
            Joke answer: they thought these were good designs. 

Realish answer: ran out of time maybe? Every Pokémon game feels more and more rushed.
                Maybe.  The games definitely do feel rushed.  If I had to guess I'd say maybe the art team thought they were good designs for some reason but the marketing team realized which ones would land and which... kinda suck, so they showcased the good ones out front?  Idk.
[deleted]
    the new samurott is basically a reskin of the one we had
    I like the Arcanine and Samurott (even though Samurott is basically just a reskin, but I like OG samurott), Electrode is kinda hard to mess up, and Decidueye is an ok pokemon but doesn't really make sense as a Dartrix evo, but the rest are pretty terrible yeah.
    It depresses me that they managed to make Lilligant even more bland and boring.
    Decidueye looks pretty cool.  But other than that...holy crap, they suck.  Sneasel looks fine, but that's easy because Sneasel has always looked cool.  Whatever that evolution is sucks, though.
They themselves were not proud of their own work
The technical term would be garbagio. Jfc that new weavile is just fucking awful. The 3d sprites are doing them no favours tho tbf
    It’s just sneasel but longer :’(
weavile looks like the weasel from the suicide squad movie
Look at how they massacred my boy...
Yes in opinion most of these suck and only a few are likeable like the new starter evolutions are fine,Arcanine,Goodra are acceptable for me.
    I think the Ursaring is OK, if somehow a bit excessive. I've been wanting a four legged bear pokemon for a bit now, and while I would've preferred it as a grass type starter I'll take this I suppose
So many people were coming up with cool unique designs for the new electrode trying to predict it but it just ended up being a wooden version 😂😂😂
The whole game is a glorified wild area. 

The town, despite being the main hub, looks like it is the most empty town to ever exist. 

Npcs still move like they are on a gameboy.

Pokemon still have the same models/move animations from XnY. 

BUT CRAFTING GUYS CRAFTING!!!!!
Isn’t it dark type now too? Makes sense
    Water dark so we basically have a slower sharpedo with probably higher attack
I think it's a lazy design. They just took Samurott, bent its horns a bit, and slapped on some wavy lines around its armour. It doesn't feel like a new design in the same way that the other two do. I really like Oshawott and Samurott normally and I was hoping to take them through this adventure, but they did my boy dirty.
    Yah honestly I think the only reason that Samurott seems to be the most popular starter choice in this thread is because it barely changed.
Yeah I don’t think I’ll be using any new variants aside from Samurott and *maybe* Zoroark
    Man does Samurott even count? It's got different colored shells and that's about it.
    They didn’t really even change Samurott’s design, they just gave it new colors. They should have made it a bipedal like it should have been originally
Decidueye looks like a straw hat ronin, I like it. Wish the cloak were longer but it's alright as is
Samurott literally looks like a palette swap
Yeah that hasn’t been an unpopular opinion today
    Right? How the hell would they think their opinion is unpopular? Most of these look terrible. I’ll have to wait to see them in-game before I change my mind.
        Go to r/pokeleaks majority of people over there think lighting will change the core designs of these. It's insane
            I think seeing them moving in game has the chance to make some of them look better, but it can only do so much.
I think Dialga and Palkia are supposed to look like kirins? Still pretty poor execution tho.

Actually I guess they’re supposed to look like arceus, who I think is based on kirin anyways so whatever.
    From the leaks they're supposedly fused with Arceus, and retain their "normal" forms when not fused
Yeah, not that big of a fan of most of them, the only one I really like is goodra
    Palkia just looks unfinished imo they keep his shoulder things but take away his arms? Lol
        It feels like they tried to make him a centaur, but then forgot what centaurs looked like. Dialga’s looks more natural because he was already that shape.
            And then they added that big cannon to his neck, that just looks wrong in my opinion.
                Think it’s supposed to be his chest plate or something. Either that or it’s legitimately a cannon lmao.
        I think that's the point. Look like failed fusions with arceus or something
            Still poor execution. 

Reminds me of the Sw/Sh fossils. I know what they were going for, but I don’t feel they pull it off.
    I love the new Decidueye, looks like a samurai wearing a straw coat and hat (I guess not exactly a samurai, that'd be Samurott, but you know what I mean)
        Decidueye is the only starter that looks good here. Samurott looks like a reskin and Typhlosion looks… *special.*

Edit: just saw the leaked footage and yes, typhlosion looks a lot better with the fire
            I read that Typhlosion is going to be Fire/Ghost type so I can see the style they're going for with it. And as usual, Typhlosion without the flames looks very bad, so I wouldn't judge this version too hard.
Almost everyone is ok to OOF. They took Pakia’s fucking arms and it looks so bad!
Nah you captured my sentiment exactly. I’ve never been more offended. Poor design by 90% of these.
Palkia became a horse
    And learned that friendship isn’t always magic.
Shouldn't we be asking the Pokemon Company instead of Nintendo? I am not sure which one has higher authority on Pokemon designs.
    [deleted]
Seriously, this is so embarrassing
Decidueye and Arcanine aren’t bad. But uh…yeah. A lot of these aren’t great.
No you’re not. The majority of them suck. Dialga has a neck laser? Wtf???
    He looks like we caught him in the middle of swallowing a Lego.
Nah they absolutely dropped the ball.
Tbh, I prefer these over the Hisuan Lilligant.

They somehow managed to make fricking Lilligant more boring.
    It looks like its supposed to be a second evolution. Its just so bland. I love lilligant, but that form is just upseting. I also just notice the sneasel evo has near the same lazy eyes as alolan persian.
It's not Weavile, it's a new pokemon.

Hisuian Sneasel is poison/fighting with a new evolution.
    Using the type of croagunk and giving it to sneasel is cool. Turning sneasel into the love child of toxicroak and gigantimax meowth is a freaking sin.
    Sneasler. It’s a downgrade in every way lol
    Seriously? Not ice/poison? Well, it's gamefreak so I should expect to be let down.
no. Seeing all the attention charizard and blaziken gets made him depressed.
Agreed, They definitely chose the better ones to show off in trailers
Its so hideous that I almost felt like it was put there to brace me for Centaur Palkia, like it was trying to ease me into the disgusting a bit.
Nah man, they are just milking the fuck out of it rn.
    Both, both is unfortunately correct
    [deleted]
I really hope they look better in game cuz I agree
At least Hisuian Zoroark is an improvement
I was with you until Dialga
    Maybe I think that because Dialga looks so much better than Palkia, but that’s admittedly a very low bar to clear.
Yes. Evolution is no longer automatic and you can choose to evolve your Pokémon when they meet the right conditions.
they haven’t been okay for a long time
Why do you think there is no chicorita?
Palkia learned that friendship isn’t magic.
It's real. I'm so sorry.
Goomy just has its regular form, sligoo and goodra get the new forms
But at what cost?
I understand the lore reasons for  Kyurem and Necrozma, but why would Arceus fuse with his own creations?
    I assume that's what the game will be about, but my guess is that it's forced to by the humans
        If that's the case I will instantly forgive these atrocious designs, as there are supposed to look absolutely horrible
            Bruh they got a gigalith stuck in dialga's throat
                Its like that squidward choking on a fork meme
        How would they be forced, in BW I understand it they had the technology. But this game is set 2000(?) years ago so like how?
     "Well, first of all, through God all things are possible, so jot that down."
    Alabama joke.
    My guess is that it isn't fused, but rather purified

God made us in his image, Arceus made Palkia and Dialga in his image, and over time they lost some of their power
I don't like the movement twords more and more legendaries doing this. It feels like it takes away from Kyurem's whole shtick.
    But kyurems whole thing is that it's still incomplete even after it fuses 
The other pokemon are complete before they fuse 
So if we get a gen5 remake or a legend for the gen 5 region  we will probably get yet another form
        I want to see the Original Dragon Pokemon so bad.
            Don’t know why we ain’t got a game based on it yet and have that as the legendary, baffled.
                Maybe we'll get it in a future Unova based legends game
                    Shit, that's a great idea. It could follow the original conflict between truth and ideals! ~~And maybe your choice between the two will actually affect the story!~~
                        Pokemon Legends Kyurem would kick ass. I'd play that
                    Man imagine a legebds game based on kalos. On what happened 3000 yrs ago. And the adventure of zygarde and that hero greninja who save the entire kalos region from shambles.
Still, they messed dialga and palkia big time
    I don't dislike the new form...but I think palkia needs arms to balance out
        Yeah Palkia could've looked alright. His design already resembles a gladiator, so some arms and he would've been a cool celestial centaur.  
Dialga on the other hand...
    I think as long as the narrative makes sense for the change in design then I'll be happy with it. At least this explains why there was no new form in BDSP
        Probably will have something to do with the weird statue that represented both of them in the OG diamond and pearl.
            Yeah they look a lot like the eterna (or rockveil i don't remember) statue
I think it's actually the opposite, they will fuse to make arceus. It's more lore accurate
    If true, that'd be a kind of neat retcon. Dialga seems to have more Arceus elements than the other.

Doesn’t change the fact that Palkia looks like an eldritch horror though.
        Well not necessarily dialga has the cross and palkia has the outer rings
I think it's meant to be Arceus' torso
It's nnot even a horse it's like

armless centaur
[deleted]
    Typhlosion looks drugged out of his mind
        Players: We want Typhlosion to be burning again  
Gamefreak: Well he will be blazing alright
            if you didn't see cyndaquil has his fire on all the time again, this is the model without the in game visual effects
            Ngl I kinda love stoned Typhlosion. Dude needed to chill a little, and now he can.
        I think it's hilarious and I'm picking him. Highphlosion is great.
            Higpholsion and tyedye Weedville are 100% on my team. Gonna make a wook themed team for this run hahaha.
            “Highphlosion” is genius and definitely the nickname I’ll be picking. Rowlet is one of my all-time favourite across the generations, but I might have to go cindaquil just for that last form.
            Highphlosion… shit that’s good.
            I’d smoke that.
        He took one look at what they did to Palkia and Dialga and had to tranq the shit out of him.
    No, don't tell me that's supposed to be typhlosion. Stop. ☠️
    Looks like drowzee
    I'm pretty sure Typhlosion (and others shown here) will look better when animated. and I think it's a safe guess that Typhlosion is fire/ghost and will have those purple wisp flames around him when animated and he'll look much better.
Palkia straight up has nipples on his shoulders, the Arceus ring looks like plastic, and the lower body is a mush of play dough.
Sword and Shield fossil Pokémon would like to have a word.
    They at least had an excuse, since their inspirations were chimera fossils made out of many different animals to draw attention or just because they didn't know any better
This would spawn so much rule 34.

Oh god, I can't relive that moment, not again
Ptsd intensifies
No. Just no. Not again.
Too soon
He swallowed a giant water bottle; don't question it.
    He thought the only way to beat Palkia was to become the water bottle 🧐 steel/dragon/water..bottle
Man the amount of effort you must have put into making this, fair play, that's hilarious
    I wish I could draw this well. I just took it from /v/.
That’s an oval it has to be a circle!!!
    “What’d I do that time??”
“I don’t know,I guess he just doesn’t like you!”

I demand justice for typhlosion
    It will likely have purple ghostly flames so that’s cool
Typhlosion just be chilling in a cloud of smoke.
I would too if I came out of the design room dripping with white goo.
You know what, that is fair
Look how they massacred my boy...
Damn didn’t know they made Bruxish into a force of nature
    It has a weird semblance to Ghirahim to me.
        Or the love child of Him from Powerpuff Girls and Ghirahim. 

"Himahim"
            Owner of the Himsdale Himmadome?
What is the typing?
    It is confirmed Fairy/Flying
        So then love is a force of nature? I kind of hope it's name isn't Lovurus..
            It’s called Enamorus
    Looks like fairy flying

Togekiss PTSD
    I don't think it's been stated yet, but given the colouration, I'd presume Fairy.
It's the pokemon that's going to stop the Mongols from invading
Whatever it is, whoever designed it should be fired

From a cannon
I just realized that Nintendo just made the fourth Chinese Heavenly Beast. We currently have This new one as the Black Turtle of the North, Thunderus as the Azure dragon of the East, Tornadus as the Vermilion Bird of the South, and Landorus as the White Tiger of the West. Next we may see the Golden Kirin of the Center.
    I think Arceus is supposed to be based on a kirin
        And Mt Coronet/Spear Pillar are in the center
        Holy shit this changes everything

Fimfiction prepare yourselves for I am armed with more knowledge
        Shiny Arceus is also golden.
RIP the force of love is dead in present day Pokémon.
    I blame humanity for that one.

Just look at what happened to these pokemon:

Corsola -> galarian Corsola

Zorua -> hisuian zorua

hisuian voltorb -> voltorb
        (Ir)regular reminder of Togekiss' PokéDex entry:

> It will never appear where there is strife. Its sightings have become rare recently.
            What a oddly haunting pokedex entry, it's such a simple one too. What the fuck was going on with the guy who wrote that
            >ok at what happened to these pokemon:  
>  
>Corsola -> galarian Corsola

imagine if a few generation later togekiss is considered a mythical

    Skullgreymon be like
Honestly Lilligant reminds me a lot of Lilamon, just inverting colors
And two of those blurry photos were actually of missingno
Fucking toasters for arms
Mistakes were made.
How does Dialga look alright? He looks like he swallowed an oversized brolen fidget spinner
Still think Primal Dialga looks better.
dialga does NOT look alright, the fuck??? look at his neck it’s like that scene where squidward chokes on a fork 


look at his feet what the fuck it’s like his toes are on pizza tables
Gone, reduced to atoms
Maybe Gastrodon split off from the Goodra line? After all, one's pink and one's blue; meanwhile, Goodra is lavender.
    This is the perfect example of two intrests I love falling together perfectly: Pokemon and speculative biology/evolution.
What if we got a fossil ancestor that connects goomy, shellos, and slugma?
Oh ok. I've never noticed it before for some reason.
    Could be cool if Weezing's shiny had a alternate model with three. I always thought it was a missed opportunity. If a dex entry mentions a rare variant it should be referenced in the shiny.
        Crystal onyx
I realize that but was wondering and kind of hoping that supposed "older forms" of pokemon would be present or included. Another thing I've been speculating on is fossil mons and possibly an older form of it being available in game that way because I can't really see them just completely removing fossil pokemon especially Cranidos and Shieldon completely from the game.

 I am also curious about the area around where Floaroma is located and if the Shaymin myth will be explored based off of the dialogue of an npc saying nothing would grow there until someone expressed graditude causing the area to burst into bloom. I'm remembering this off the top of my head so sorry if I don't have the exact wording.
people were asking for more gender variants.
THAT IS FLUFF-
    Can we NOT have another Pokkèn Blaziken incident?
He swallowed his pride
wait so no joke this… this is real? Holy fucking shit these designs are atrocious.
After looking at them again, I can say that Dialga isn't that bad (despite the difference in the shape of the legs), but Palkia is still so... unnatural.

The shoulders are what I can't stand

Why take a dragon and turn it into a centaur without arms?
    the dialgia one just looks more …. sharp i guess. not the worst thing ever and i could see it looking badass in game. however…. palkia i cannot wrap my head around what it could possibly look like in game to make this design cool. and this comes from someone who much rather prefers palkia over dialgia in the original games.
This comment is being overwritten in protest of Reddit's CEO spez (Steve Huffman) being a piece of shit and killing 3rd party apps.
    Wasn't Klefki also a big abuser of all three of those things? I actually remember Klefki being more overt considering that was its primary niche.

For Lando-T though, it does pretty much every single role, and does them well. If you're struggling to think of something to fill out your team, the answer is probably Lando-T. Looking at the Pikalytics OU usage stats, it has a **52.75%** usage. That is *insane*. The next highest is Ferrothorn at 26.81%.
        I used to run swagkey and mega kanga in gen 5 3v3s and it was amazing. Swagger, T-wave, foul play on klefki and scrappy return/EQ/PUP/Shadow Claw for kanga. Always loved not using mega first turn and getting the PUP into their ghost type because I was still scrappy.
No, not finaly. My boy qwilfish just got fucked by this thing. Now he will be even more forgoten and everyone will use hisuian form. Why couldnt they just give johto qwilfish evolution like they did with stantler?
    Actually, quilfish can run an eviolite now so its usage is going to skyrocket
        Actually he can not, only hisuian Qwilfish can, old water poison still cant
            Oh shoot, I didn’t think we were getting one. Hopefully it has similar stats and keeps intimidate and swift swim.
            It doesn't look like there will be a Hisuian Qwilfish if it isn't in this leak. There isn't an Alolan Cubone that evolves into Alolan Marowak. If regular Qwilfish is the one that evolves into this new form then it'll basically just be like any other cross gen evolution and the eviolite will work.
Yeah, t-spikes and intimidate and stab on grass types is great.
What about the Meowth Galar evolution?
    And I _almost_ forgot about it until you brought it up
Makes sense but still not a fan of slender sneasel
wait I didn't even think about this, all these forms are doomed to die and go extinct lmfao
    And yet, we'll probably have a way to transfer them to mainline games.

"I love you Arcanine. Now I'm gonna put you in a pokeball time capsule and send you 200 years into the future! Byeee!"
        evil Pokémon origin story. Trapped alone for 200 years by trainer
            Oof that is harsh. I hope they find a one-way time portal instead. Dialga is the god of time, after all. Could make a little wormhole
            Didn’t something like that happen to a Lucario in that one movie
    It's okay. If they get fossilized they can be miraculously brought back to life for some reason.
        “Life, uh, finds a way.”
        Why didn’t I think of this as a reason to have these Pokémon in future games? This whole time I’ve been thinking these new Hisuian Pokémon are cool but I haven’t been able to get super excited about them because they won’t be in the meta in the future. But if they decide they want to bring back some of these Pokémon, they totally could in the form of fossils. And actually, there could totally be a secluded area of a region in a future game that is a home to ancient Hisuian Growlithe. Totally possible to do tbh
Thank god they did in the current Pokémon timeline. If I had to use that Hisuian typhlosion in the original/remake johto games I would’ve dropped Pokémon a long time ago
    Mf only knows one move, blaze
Of all the designs leaked today, I actually kind of like the more subdued look Typhlosion has. I'm very excited to see its flames, of course, but it'll be nice to start with a Ghost/Fire starter. I've been wanting to play with a ghost team from the start for ages(I missed out on Alola).
    Typhlosion is Ghost/Fire?
        That’s the big rumor, yeah
Well I’m guessing they did that to go from slug to snail
Earlier leaks said Dragon/Steel and they've been pretty spot on with what was leaked today.
snails aren't bugs they're mollusks which includes clams, oysters, octopus, and squid
Snails aren't really bugs tho. They are Mollusks like squids and octopi.
typhlosion is still a wild card, no flames yet
    Typhlosion looks like it just wants a hug
        Looks high af
    This. We still haven’t seen it with flames on.
        i hate that typhlosion doesnt have constant flames ever since the 3d swap. one of the coolest sprites reduced to a smooth noodle boy.
            If we look the cyndaquil model has constant flames but this model just has them off it will probably have constant flames as well
            If you look at previews and leaked footage, Cyndaquil has flames a good portion of the time. They’re not a part of the model, but rather seem to be some sort of particle effect. It’s totally possible Typhlosion will have flames (or ghost wisps or whatever) virtually all of the time. But that won’t come across in a still render likely just pulled from the obj file
            I like this one’s mellow mood already, and also the flames look like they’ll stay on because Cyndaquil has them all the time.
Theyre real. The game got dumped last night
I'm thinking Arceus just naturally made them in its own likeness, and as time went on they gradually changed. This is just them before that change, because Palkia almost looks like they're in the middle of whatever this new form is and their original form.
    I like this interpretation best.
But come on... It could've looked so much better...
    Oh, I 100% agree. And we didn't need them. The above is more my thought on why they probably did it. Again, we definitely didn't need these. If they were going to set them up, they could've been better.
        Tbh i kinda like the look of Dialga, Palkia is messed up tho
I actually think it’s palkia and dialga mid creation. Like arceus is in the process of making them and like all gods he starts with a shape in its own image
Dual type Normal/Gravy
Broke: being excited about ugly Ursaring evolution

Woke: Exited regular Ursaring has access to eviolite now
    That does raise the question, if this is a regional exclusive evolution, will the Eviolite still be an option in future versions if they don't have an evolution for Ursaring?
        They may probably introduce a system in the next game that will be like "of you bring us fossils or a record of this pokemon from your ancestors, we can bring it back how it was according to this DNA and make it exactly how your ancestors described!" 

Allowing you to transfer pokes from PKMN A.
    No held items in legends arceus, and the main meta is gonna still be in sword and shield sadly (gen 9 better include these mons in the dex via pokemon home)
Fat dog for midterms!
    #It's a bear dance!  

*screams garretly*
It reminds me of the sea bear from SpongeBob
Especially since we kind of already had primal dialga in mystery dungeon
    Primal Dialga is a bit of a translation error - in Japanese it’s called Dark Dialga so just a corrupted Dialga.

But in my headcanon it’s still Primal Dialga because that’s way cooler and I fkn love PMD2.
    "Primal" Dialga is just a recolor, not nearly enough to make it a new form. Although looking at Alolan Dugtrio I wouldn't put it past them...
        You leave Alolan Dugtrio and his luscious locks alone
Primal form would have looked leagues better than whatever this is
They’re just lilligant’s regular eyes but turned upside down, maybe that’s why it looks off
    Oh wow, you're right! Amazing how simply flipping its eyes upside down turns Lilligant into an Ultra Beast.
Looks like liligant without a “dress” to me.
[deleted]
    not the gen 1 poster boy not getting enough attention having two mega evolutions and a gigantimax form!

joking, typhlosion fan here just being sad
Hoping it has purple flames since I'm pretty sure it's fire and ghost
    The dots on its neck are purple so that implies they are. The dots on its neck being in front also implies the flames come out and warp around their neck as opposed to their back.
        Like a cape or like a scarf?
            I’m guessing scarf, the dots are where the fire comes out and if you look you can see 3 dots on the front and then they go up to the sides, unclear if they are on the back or not.
            If it’s a ghost I imagine the fire wraps around it’s face to make it look like a floating face engulfed in flame.
There it is. Hope.
Even without the fire, I legitimately like it. I just think the sleepy/high look makes it seem kinda cute.
    Right? I love typhlosion's original design, but this new one looks fun.
An Amputaur.
    Dang now I can’t stop thinking about an alternate evolution to tyrannitar it’s electric type With Tesla coils on its back with some thing instead of its normal spikes Or maybe just some charged rocks with electricity Like in charge stone cave
Dialga choking on an oversized toothpick LMAO
    Nah, somebody just shoved cofagrigus down his throat
Im usually not very picky and just happy for a new pokemon game half the time but how the actual fuck can you defend half of these. I can understand liking a couple of these but some of them are just not improvements or downgrades of the original version. I genuinely like samurott, decidueye, basculegion (i believe thats what its called) and arcanine, but most of the other ones look like they got a 7 year old to draw fakemon and they made them real. I really hope this shit gets changed or just outright removed.
And then calling us toxic for not liking the designs.
Conspiracy theory: They showed the good ones to hype up preorders, kept the bad designs until release.
    I mean it kinda makes sense but if they know they're bad, why make bad designs in the first place?
        Joke answer: they thought these were good designs. 

Realish answer: ran out of time maybe? Every Pokémon game feels more and more rushed.
            Maybe.  The games definitely do feel rushed.  If I had to guess I'd say maybe the art team thought they were good designs for some reason but the marketing team realized which ones would land and which... kinda suck, so they showcased the good ones out front?  Idk.
the new samurott is basically a reskin of the one we had
I like the Arcanine and Samurott (even though Samurott is basically just a reskin, but I like OG samurott), Electrode is kinda hard to mess up, and Decidueye is an ok pokemon but doesn't really make sense as a Dartrix evo, but the rest are pretty terrible yeah.
It depresses me that they managed to make Lilligant even more bland and boring.
Decidueye looks pretty cool.  But other than that...holy crap, they suck.  Sneasel looks fine, but that's easy because Sneasel has always looked cool.  Whatever that evolution is sucks, though.
It’s just sneasel but longer :’(
I think the Ursaring is OK, if somehow a bit excessive. I've been wanting a four legged bear pokemon for a bit now, and while I would've preferred it as a grass type starter I'll take this I suppose
Water dark so we basically have a slower sharpedo with probably higher attack
Yah honestly I think the only reason that Samurott seems to be the most popular starter choice in this thread is because it barely changed.
Man does Samurott even count? It's got different colored shells and that's about it.
They didn’t really even change Samurott’s design, they just gave it new colors. They should have made it a bipedal like it should have been originally
Right? How the hell would they think their opinion is unpopular? Most of these look terrible. I’ll have to wait to see them in-game before I change my mind.
    Go to r/pokeleaks majority of people over there think lighting will change the core designs of these. It's insane
        I think seeing them moving in game has the chance to make some of them look better, but it can only do so much.
From the leaks they're supposedly fused with Arceus, and retain their "normal" forms when not fused
Palkia just looks unfinished imo they keep his shoulder things but take away his arms? Lol
    It feels like they tried to make him a centaur, but then forgot what centaurs looked like. Dialga’s looks more natural because he was already that shape.
        And then they added that big cannon to his neck, that just looks wrong in my opinion.
            Think it’s supposed to be his chest plate or something. Either that or it’s legitimately a cannon lmao.
    I think that's the point. Look like failed fusions with arceus or something
        Still poor execution. 

Reminds me of the Sw/Sh fossils. I know what they were going for, but I don’t feel they pull it off.
I love the new Decidueye, looks like a samurai wearing a straw coat and hat (I guess not exactly a samurai, that'd be Samurott, but you know what I mean)
    Decidueye is the only starter that looks good here. Samurott looks like a reskin and Typhlosion looks… *special.*

Edit: just saw the leaked footage and yes, typhlosion looks a lot better with the fire
        I read that Typhlosion is going to be Fire/Ghost type so I can see the style they're going for with it. And as usual, Typhlosion without the flames looks very bad, so I wouldn't judge this version too hard.
And learned that friendship isn’t always magic.
[deleted]
He looks like we caught him in the middle of swallowing a Lego.
It looks like its supposed to be a second evolution. Its just so bland. I love lilligant, but that form is just upseting. I also just notice the sneasel evo has near the same lazy eyes as alolan persian.
Using the type of croagunk and giving it to sneasel is cool. Turning sneasel into the love child of toxicroak and gigantimax meowth is a freaking sin.
Sneasler. It’s a downgrade in every way lol
Seriously? Not ice/poison? Well, it's gamefreak so I should expect to be let down.
Both, both is unfortunately correct
[deleted]
Maybe I think that because Dialga looks so much better than Palkia, but that’s admittedly a very low bar to clear.
I assume that's what the game will be about, but my guess is that it's forced to by the humans
    If that's the case I will instantly forgive these atrocious designs, as there are supposed to look absolutely horrible
        Bruh they got a gigalith stuck in dialga's throat
            Its like that squidward choking on a fork meme
    How would they be forced, in BW I understand it they had the technology. But this game is set 2000(?) years ago so like how?
 "Well, first of all, through God all things are possible, so jot that down."
Alabama joke.
My guess is that it isn't fused, but rather purified

God made us in his image, Arceus made Palkia and Dialga in his image, and over time they lost some of their power
But kyurems whole thing is that it's still incomplete even after it fuses 
The other pokemon are complete before they fuse 
So if we get a gen5 remake or a legend for the gen 5 region  we will probably get yet another form
    I want to see the Original Dragon Pokemon so bad.
        Don’t know why we ain’t got a game based on it yet and have that as the legendary, baffled.
            Maybe we'll get it in a future Unova based legends game
                Shit, that's a great idea. It could follow the original conflict between truth and ideals! ~~And maybe your choice between the two will actually affect the story!~~
                    Pokemon Legends Kyurem would kick ass. I'd play that
                Man imagine a legebds game based on kalos. On what happened 3000 yrs ago. And the adventure of zygarde and that hero greninja who save the entire kalos region from shambles.
I don't dislike the new form...but I think palkia needs arms to balance out
    Yeah Palkia could've looked alright. His design already resembles a gladiator, so some arms and he would've been a cool celestial centaur.  
Dialga on the other hand...
I think as long as the narrative makes sense for the change in design then I'll be happy with it. At least this explains why there was no new form in BDSP
    Probably will have something to do with the weird statue that represented both of them in the OG diamond and pearl.
        Yeah they look a lot like the eterna (or rockveil i don't remember) statue
If true, that'd be a kind of neat retcon. Dialga seems to have more Arceus elements than the other.

Doesn’t change the fact that Palkia looks like an eldritch horror though.
    Well not necessarily dialga has the cross and palkia has the outer rings
Typhlosion looks drugged out of his mind
    Players: We want Typhlosion to be burning again  
Gamefreak: Well he will be blazing alright
        if you didn't see cyndaquil has his fire on all the time again, this is the model without the in game visual effects
        Ngl I kinda love stoned Typhlosion. Dude needed to chill a little, and now he can.
    I think it's hilarious and I'm picking him. Highphlosion is great.
        Higpholsion and tyedye Weedville are 100% on my team. Gonna make a wook themed team for this run hahaha.
        “Highphlosion” is genius and definitely the nickname I’ll be picking. Rowlet is one of my all-time favourite across the generations, but I might have to go cindaquil just for that last form.
        Highphlosion… shit that’s good.
        I’d smoke that.
    He took one look at what they did to Palkia and Dialga and had to tranq the shit out of him.
No, don't tell me that's supposed to be typhlosion. Stop. ☠️
Looks like drowzee
I'm pretty sure Typhlosion (and others shown here) will look better when animated. and I think it's a safe guess that Typhlosion is fire/ghost and will have those purple wisp flames around him when animated and he'll look much better.
They at least had an excuse, since their inspirations were chimera fossils made out of many different animals to draw attention or just because they didn't know any better

It will likely have purple ghostly flames so that’s cool
It has a weird semblance to Ghirahim to me.

It is confirmed Fairy/Flying
    So then love is a force of nature? I kind of hope it's name isn't Lovurus..
        It’s called Enamorus
Looks like fairy flying

Togekiss PTSD
I don't think it's been stated yet, but given the colouration, I'd presume Fairy.
I think Arceus is supposed to be based on a kirin
    And Mt Coronet/Spear Pillar are in the center
    Holy shit this changes everything

Fimfiction prepare yourselves for I am armed with more knowledge
    Shiny Arceus is also golden.
I blame humanity for that one.

Just look at what happened to these pokemon:

Corsola -> galarian Corsola

Zorua -> hisuian zorua

hisuian voltorb -> voltorb
    (Ir)regular reminder of Togekiss' PokéDex entry:

> It will never appear where there is strife. Its sightings have become rare recently.
        What a oddly haunting pokedex entry, it's such a simple one too. What the fuck was going on with the guy who wrote that
        >ok at what happened to these pokemon:  
>  
>Corsola -> galarian Corsola

imagine if a few generation later togekiss is considered a mythical
Skullgreymon be like
This is the perfect example of two intrests I love falling together perfectly: Pokemon and speculative biology/evolution.
Could be cool if Weezing's shiny had a alternate model with three. I always thought it was a missed opportunity. If a dex entry mentions a rare variant it should be referenced in the shiny.
    Crystal onyx
Can we NOT have another Pokkèn Blaziken incident?
the dialgia one just looks more …. sharp i guess. not the worst thing ever and i could see it looking badass in game. however…. palkia i cannot wrap my head around what it could possibly look like in game to make this design cool. and this comes from someone who much rather prefers palkia over dialgia in the original games.
Wasn't Klefki also a big abuser of all three of those things? I actually remember Klefki being more overt considering that was its primary niche.

For Lando-T though, it does pretty much every single role, and does them well. If you're struggling to think of something to fill out your team, the answer is probably Lando-T. Looking at the Pikalytics OU usage stats, it has a **52.75%** usage. That is *insane*. The next highest is Ferrothorn at 26.81%.
    I used to run swagkey and mega kanga in gen 5 3v3s and it was amazing. Swagger, T-wave, foul play on klefki and scrappy return/EQ/PUP/Shadow Claw for kanga. Always loved not using mega first turn and getting the PUP into their ghost type because I was still scrappy.
Actually, quilfish can run an eviolite now so its usage is going to skyrocket
    Actually he can not, only hisuian Qwilfish can, old water poison still cant
        Oh shoot, I didn’t think we were getting one. Hopefully it has similar stats and keeps intimidate and swift swim.
        It doesn't look like there will be a Hisuian Qwilfish if it isn't in this leak. There isn't an Alolan Cubone that evolves into Alolan Marowak. If regular Qwilfish is the one that evolves into this new form then it'll basically just be like any other cross gen evolution and the eviolite will work.
And I _almost_ forgot about it until you brought it up

    I read that Typhlosion is going to be Fire/Ghost type so I can see the style they're going for with it. And as usual, Typhlosion without the flames looks very bad, so I wouldn't judge this version too hard.
If that's the case I will instantly forgive these atrocious designs, as there are supposed to look absolutely horrible
    Bruh they got a gigalith stuck in dialga's throat
        Its like that squidward choking on a fork meme
How would they be forced, in BW I understand it they had the technology. But this game is set 2000(?) years ago so like how?
I want to see the Original Dragon Pokemon so bad.
    Don’t know why we ain’t got a game based on it yet and have that as the legendary, baffled.
        Maybe we'll get it in a future Unova based legends game
            Shit, that's a great idea. It could follow the original conflict between truth and ideals! ~~And maybe your choice between the two will actually affect the story!~~
                Pokemon Legends Kyurem would kick ass. I'd play that
            Man imagine a legebds game based on kalos. On what happened 3000 yrs ago. And the adventure of zygarde and that hero greninja who save the entire kalos region from shambles.
Yeah Palkia could've looked alright. His design already resembles a gladiator, so some arms and he would've been a cool celestial centaur.  
Dialga on the other hand...
Probably will have something to do with the weird statue that represented both of them in the OG diamond and pearl.
    Yeah they look a lot like the eterna (or rockveil i don't remember) statue
Well not necessarily dialga has the cross and palkia has the outer rings
Players: We want Typhlosion to be burning again  
Gamefreak: Well he will be blazing alright
    if you didn't see cyndaquil has his fire on all the time again, this is the model without the in game visual effects
    Ngl I kinda love stoned Typhlosion. Dude needed to chill a little, and now he can.
I think it's hilarious and I'm picking him. Highphlosion is great.
    Higpholsion and tyedye Weedville are 100% on my team. Gonna make a wook themed team for this run hahaha.
    “Highphlosion” is genius and definitely the nickname I’ll be picking. Rowlet is one of my all-time favourite across the generations, but I might have to go cindaquil just for that last form.
    Highphlosion… shit that’s good.
    I’d smoke that.
He took one look at what they did to Palkia and Dialga and had to tranq the shit out of him.

“Pretend to be someone else!”
Good thing we're all wearing our anti-sea rhinoceros underwear! Haha right Squidward?
Sneasonal Depression
Or the love child of Him from Powerpuff Girls and Ghirahim. 

"Himahim"
    Owner of the Himsdale Himmadome?
So then love is a force of nature? I kind of hope it's name isn't Lovurus..
    It’s called Enamorus
And Mt Coronet/Spear Pillar are in the center
Holy shit this changes everything

Fimfiction prepare yourselves for I am armed with more knowledge
Shiny Arceus is also golden.
(Ir)regular reminder of Togekiss' PokéDex entry:

> It will never appear where there is strife. Its sightings have become rare recently.
    What a oddly haunting pokedex entry, it's such a simple one too. What the fuck was going on with the guy who wrote that
    >ok at what happened to these pokemon:  
>  
>Corsola -> galarian Corsola

imagine if a few generation later togekiss is considered a mythical
Crystal onyx
I used to run swagkey and mega kanga in gen 5 3v3s and it was amazing. Swagger, T-wave, foul play on klefki and scrappy return/EQ/PUP/Shadow Claw for kanga. Always loved not using mega first turn and getting the PUP into their ghost type because I was still scrappy.
Actually he can not, only hisuian Qwilfish can, old water poison still cant
    Oh shoot, I didn’t think we were getting one. Hopefully it has similar stats and keeps intimidate and swift swim.
    It doesn't look like there will be a Hisuian Qwilfish if it isn't in this leak. There isn't an Alolan Cubone that evolves into Alolan Marowak. If regular Qwilfish is the one that evolves into this new form then it'll basically just be like any other cross gen evolution and the eviolite will work.
evil Pokémon origin story. Trapped alone for 200 years by trainer
    Oof that is harsh. I hope they find a one-way time portal instead. Dialga is the god of time, after all. Could make a little wormhole
    Didn’t something like that happen to a Lucario in that one movie
“Life, uh, finds a way.”
Why didn’t I think of this as a reason to have these Pokémon in future games? This whole time I’ve been thinking these new Hisuian Pokémon are cool but I haven’t been able to get super excited about them because they won’t be in the meta in the future. But if they decide they want to bring back some of these Pokémon, they totally could in the form of fossils. And actually, there could totally be a secluded area of a region in a future game that is a home to ancient Hisuian Growlithe. Totally possible to do tbh
That’s the big rumor, yeah
Looks high af
i hate that typhlosion doesnt have constant flames ever since the 3d swap. one of the coolest sprites reduced to a smooth noodle boy.
    If we look the cyndaquil model has constant flames but this model just has them off it will probably have constant flames as well
    If you look at previews and leaked footage, Cyndaquil has flames a good portion of the time. They’re not a part of the model, but rather seem to be some sort of particle effect. It’s totally possible Typhlosion will have flames (or ghost wisps or whatever) virtually all of the time. But that won’t come across in a still render likely just pulled from the obj file
    I like this one’s mellow mood already, and also the flames look like they’ll stay on because Cyndaquil has them all the time.
Tbh i kinda like the look of Dialga, Palkia is messed up tho
They may probably introduce a system in the next game that will be like "of you bring us fossils or a record of this pokemon from your ancestors, we can bring it back how it was according to this DNA and make it exactly how your ancestors described!" 

Allowing you to transfer pokes from PKMN A.
You leave Alolan Dugtrio and his luscious locks alone
Like a cape or like a scarf?
    I’m guessing scarf, the dots are where the fire comes out and if you look you can see 3 dots on the front and then they go up to the sides, unclear if they are on the back or not.
    If it’s a ghost I imagine the fire wraps around it’s face to make it look like a floating face engulfed in flame.
Joke answer: they thought these were good designs. 

Realish answer: ran out of time maybe? Every Pokémon game feels more and more rushed.
    Maybe.  The games definitely do feel rushed.  If I had to guess I'd say maybe the art team thought they were good designs for some reason but the marketing team realized which ones would land and which... kinda suck, so they showcased the good ones out front?  Idk.
I think seeing them moving in game has the chance to make some of them look better, but it can only do so much.
And then they added that big cannon to his neck, that just looks wrong in my opinion.
    Think it’s supposed to be his chest plate or something. Either that or it’s legitimately a cannon lmao.
Still poor execution. 

Reminds me of the Sw/Sh fossils. I know what they were going for, but I don’t feel they pull it off.
I read that Typhlosion is going to be Fire/Ghost type so I can see the style they're going for with it. And as usual, Typhlosion without the flames looks very bad, so I wouldn't judge this version too hard.
