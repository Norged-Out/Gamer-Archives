[[What happened to Volo after you beat him in the post game]]





Hiding somewhere in the world waiting for a dumbass Trainer to walk in on him. Just like his descendant Cynthia in Undella Town.
    I thought Cynthia descended from Cogita, not Vollo.
        Volo looks very similar to Cynthia, has most of Cynthia's team, and his battle theme sounds similar to Cynthia's. Maybe Volo and Cogita's descendants got together after a few generations?
            I think yeah it is more likely their descendants got together than them
                Imho it's more that Volo is a far descendant of Cogita. Cogita has whole mythical wibe and is clearly much older than Volo despite looking young. I think that some magical Sinjoh fuckery is afoot.
                    How far back is Hisui?
                        Not that far iirc. Equivalent to 19th century I think.
                            Yeah it‚Äôs like 2 centuries before whole Cyrus thing
                    >Volo is a far descendent of Cynthia

                        Yeah, I meant Cogita here, not Cynthia.
                    Maybe he‚Äôs a baby of both of them
            Ive been persuaded that volo is an ancestor of lusamine
                But their battle themes‚Ä¶
                    multiple children can happen, letting both of them descend from the same person
                    Sometimes i forget to play with sound on
                I can kinda see it
                You know what now that I think about it, he also does the crazy wide-eyed stare thing that Lusamine does huh
            I do however love the differences between Cynthia's team and Volo's team. Cynthia's ace is Garchomp, a Ground/ Dragon type. Volo's ace is Togekiss, a Flying/ Fairy type. That's about as close as you're gonna be able to get to a polar opposite
            But volo is a time traveller i saw a video about him (im not sure)
        I'm sure she decends from both.

They may have been together
Their descendants may have been together


She clearly "takes" inspiration from both in several ways
        I remember there's some theory about Cogita being immortal, as for why she and Volo look alike, I don't know, but I'm preeeetty sure Cynthia descended from Volo
        Cogita is the ancestor of Fantina
            Lmao. XD
        I personally think Volo and Cogita are together
    How funny would it be if they did the exact Undella Town Cynthia house in a future Legends game but with Volo
        I was thinking this, legends unova, random House where undella town is now, Volo waiting inside. That would actually be the perfect callback.
Went off to cry somewhere forever probably
    me irl
He disappears to pout
I think he'll search for other ways to find arceus maybe? But I hope the theories of him being a time traveller are true and he turns up in a future game. Or even if he's a side character in another legends game would be cool.
    Well since Masters just opened up a Space-Time rift and has Adaman and Irida now, that door is wide open for Volo too.
        That's true, not sure if masters is cannon to the main line games tho.
            It's a soft-canon. Everyone is in character, but pretty much nothing is happening on the main timeline of the games.

For example: Lance, Leon and Steven never got together to discuss capes in fashion, standing on a mountain path.
    I believe that, if we get more Legends games, Volo will be the overarching antagonist.
Forgot to use Braviary and died falling from a high place.
    On purpose
        I completely expected him to run off the edge of the temple after getting his arse whupped from the post-fight dialogue
He leaves - doesn‚Äôt show up again and no one knows where he went
    He ded
He sells rare items
I guess he told Laventon to put Giratina in the Pok√©dex, then turned himself in to Kamado and is now banned from entering the Hisui region
Volontarily retired
He walked out, told you satan wanted to protect the world now, and just never appeared again. Probably still seething that God chose someone else over him.

&#x200B;

Somewhere along the line a lineage leading to Cynthia was produced.
Traveled the world teaching hair dressers how to style hair like his.
Hmm if we get a legends Johto maybe we'll see him there and hopefully our character from legends Arceus shows up too cause of sinjoh
    if Volo becomes the new (old?) Team Rocket in ancient times I would be SO pumped

just attempting to procure any and all legendary pokemon he hears of to try and form his perfect world
All we know is he told Laventon that you should catch Satan and add it to your dex
He cried a lot.

(And that‚Äôs okay.)
I keep thinking that either Volo is colgetas son, or her later husband and idk which one is worse
    I heard he was her nephew
He's banished to the same place he pulled giratina out of, by arceus (/j)... I wish this were truly the case tho...
    Cyrus: ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe that little punk beat me, TWICE!! And I literally had Giratina on my side!!! Now I‚Äôm stuck in this weird dimension!!‚Äù

Volo rubbing sticks together to make a campfire: ‚ÄúFirst time?‚Äù
He hides in the overworld and becomes the first ‚Äúhey! entirely random person that just locked eyes with me, let‚Äôs battle‚Äù person (Aka bug catcher from route 1)
Considering Cynthia happened, I can think of at least *one* thing he did after the game.
He somehow fucked and had a lineage that led to cynthiae
    I am absolutely sure that's a typo but your comment now implies the existence of multiple Cynthia as a species and that's a scary thought.
        Don‚Äôt worry the species is weak to ice, usually
He disappears into a portal to never be seen again
Who really was the architect of Aether foundation
Arceus eats him
    I like this theory.
Garitina drags him to the distortion world princess and the frog style for trying to destroy hisui
He malded so hard that he vanished
Like any Japanese man dishonored during the edo period, he began ritual seppuku. Dishonor is a hell of a thing.
Simple answer. I wanted to fight him again.
He heard of another great pokemon and went to a kingdom to try to find it, but accidentally causes the kingdom to fall and the pokemon to be no more (if you know you know)
    did he carve the first dna splicers too?
        Who knows. I just like th ides that he goes to different regions to look for legendsaries or mythicals and "accidentally" causes massive chaos
            fair enough.
i ate him he offered me a sandwich and didn't pay up
I'm assuming he is long-lived, as his words imply he may live centuries from the point in the game, it's possible he lingers in the dark, and in the time of present DPPT, he influences Cyrus to go with his universal reset plan, but instead has to deal with Cyrus wanting to eradicate emotion or something, rather than his own image.
Giratina took him. Wasn‚Äôt made for this world.
Went to go sulk and get laid.
Volo finds an equally insane wife and down the line comes Lusamine.
I mean, have we ever discussed that it's possible Volo himself came through a rift? He could have been one of the actual Celestia, maybe even Cogita's Ancestor.
    I honestly thought he was from a rift as well as I was playing. He just knew too much.
He went off to go f himself
    Considering Cynthia happened, I say he went off to f someone else
‚Äúvolo, age 45, gave himself up to the authorities after the incident. he is now serving a life sentence.‚Äù
He dies
2 options 

He leaved to an eternal journey in search of his goal 

He killed himself
I‚Äôm pretty sure he ate a tomato berry üî• afterwards
Crying in some unnamed corner.
he went to sulk in some corner of the world. he's a sore loser, he'll be there for a while
Spoilers
spoilers
the player caught an Abra and had it teleport Volo off the peak of Mt Coronet
MF can't handle the fact that God chose a kid from the future to meet them.

Really, it was mainly to quell the crap that **HE** started.
Maybe smashing cogita since after that you can't access the place where you find cogita until you talk about the fourth force of nature
At some point he has reproduced. Either before or after his battle with you. So raising his kid maybe
Marrying an unknown woman and have children with her so we can face Cynthia later on.
    Cynthia and Lusamine
Making Cynthia's grandparent
Leaves and never comes back
He went back to the Gingko Guild.
[bird keeper to Toby](https://youtu.be/CisX7FwIU84) has a great video theory on it
‰∏ä‰∫¨

Went to the capital to pursue a career in theater
He gets pissed and leaves once he figures out we caught Giratina on the second Pokeball and straight spoke to God.
He continued to look for Arceus. His plots caused ripples in space and time, creating the glitches of Paldea in the future
If my character weren‚Äôt a kid, I would probably bang him or marry him, depending if he‚Äôs gonna shave his head. He is like the hottest guy in town. Then I will be Cynthia‚Äôs ancestor.
Spoiler
Went somewhere and had children presumably, so Cynthia can exist
Died of Syphilis
Spoiler pls
    Fuck no spoiler. This games been out for over a year.
Goes off to make a family with colgata
    Thats his aunt tho
        Error error n-n-n-n-nobody asked

n-n-nobody asked for your opinion-pinion
Ded
Death
Eaten by a Snorlax I guess
He got beheaded
He has reincarnate to Cyrus at some point
He travelled to Alola and settled down, eventually becoming Lusamine‚Äôs ancestor (I‚Äôm totally not being serious btw)
He trips on the steps after walking off frame and just cracks his head open like an egg.
He committed unalive
I kinda hope he shows up in the post game of other Legends games similar to how Cynthia appears in a bunch of post games in the present
He dies
He pulled a Giratina.
Dead
Went on a journey to be the very best like no one ever was .
He went to get milk
The devs weren't given enough time to write that part of the plot.
Bro gets depressed and vows revenge eventually
Abra teleport him off mountain where he fell never to be heard from again
I don't know but he hope he f\*cking dies.
he went home and took a nap
He's chilling in the shadow realm
He probably becomes depressed and commit die
He discarded himself from the bench.

^(iykyk)
He became one of the souls needed for Spiritomb
I like to think he became a little bitch and ether ran away or died
I‚Äôve always just assumed he exiled himself after failing to achieve his goals because a teenager got in his way
He is smashing somewhere because he is the ancestor of Cynthia
He doesn't need to be an immortal. Time and space doesn't exist in the distortion world and he is linked up with Giratina he could literally just be chillin in the distortion world for centuries as he claimed he would do. Dnt kno how Cyrus would feel about running into him in there lol.
Does anyone know his cannon age?
I thought Cynthia descended from Cogita, not Vollo.
    Volo looks very similar to Cynthia, has most of Cynthia's team, and his battle theme sounds similar to Cynthia's. Maybe Volo and Cogita's descendants got together after a few generations?
        I think yeah it is more likely their descendants got together than them
            Imho it's more that Volo is a far descendant of Cogita. Cogita has whole mythical wibe and is clearly much older than Volo despite looking young. I think that some magical Sinjoh fuckery is afoot.
                How far back is Hisui?
                    Not that far iirc. Equivalent to 19th century I think.
