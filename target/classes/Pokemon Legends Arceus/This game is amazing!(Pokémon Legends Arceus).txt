This game doesn't waste player's  time, it's all about exploring, capturing Pokémon and battling, and it's  fun until the end. I never expected Game Freak to listen to the  players' complaints and try something new, but they did, and in my  opinion, they really nailed it.

* There  are open areas with a lot of Pokémon, and it is incentive the player to  capture the same species in different ways for research. In the old  games, I only caught the Pokémon that I liked or that were stronger, but  not anymore, it's fun to catch any Pokémon, and complete the Pokémon  entry to earn more money and stars, so the game progression is nice.
* Switching from capturing to battle is also seamless and fun, with a very intuitive HUD.
* They  also tried something different with the story, and the lore is very  interesting. You're brought from a rift to an era where people are  curious and afraid of Pokémon instead of partners, and you have to  research Pokémon to learn more about them.
* The  traversal is also excellent; seamlessly switching between riding   Pokémon, flying, jumping into the water, and sending your Pokémon to  gather materials for crafting.
* It's fun to get new recipes, and searching from material to craft, in my opinion it was well implemented.
* The  Pokémon animations and effects during the battles are amazing, for the  first time they really make contact with each other, and you can feel  the impact of the hits. And the addition of Strong and fast moves, gave a  risk/reward system to the battle.
* Alphas  and the space-time distortion events to capture rare Pokémon are also  well implemented, and it brings diversity to the gameplay.
* Nobles  Pokémon act like bosses of a region, you have to dodge their well  telegraphed attacks (with good invincibility frames) while you trow  balms at them, and when they're weak you have to use your Pokémon to  defeat them. In my opinion, it was also very well implemented and  brought something new to the franchise.
* And  it has also some simple but very welcomed changes like, no losing your  turn when switching Pokémon, when they have any negative status, it  disperses after battle, you can change TMs at any time without the  Pokémon forgetting moves, no more forcing some Pokémon moves (like CUT)  just to progress in the game, and you can see at any time the enemies'  Pokémon type, it helps a lot.
* The soundtrack and the cinematics are also very good, and the final battle is epic.

It  for sure has problems, like low textures and a lot of pop-in, low  framerate Pokémon at distance, and the lack of character's animations,  like in the main village where the NPCs stand still making it fell less  alive, and instead of animate some scenes, Game Freak opts to black out  the screen.

And I still think that  the writing could be better, and more mature, I didn't care that much  about the characters and plot. And having to return to the main village  every time you have to fast travel to the other locations can be a  little annoying. It's an easy game, not very challenging, but not as  easy as Pokémon X and Y.

I had a blast playing it, and I believe they found the right direction for  the franchise, which had been stagnant for a while and afraid of  changes. If they fix some minor issues, I'm really looking forward to  the sequel on the new hardware.


Still mind boggling that there was no DLC for this game
    yeah, the utter lack of long term support it got is just puzzling.
        Because they didn’t develop any meaningful ranked or online mode for it. People still say it’s a « mainline » game, it didn’t get any treatment of a mainline series. GF can say it is a main line series game but they didn’t treat it as such.
            Rather than try to defer it as a side game, I'd say it expands what it means to be a mainline pokemon game.

Besides, it added new pokemon and has full connectivity with Home and the other mainline games.
                I don’t understand why some people take it as an insult or personal when I say a game is not a mainline title. My top 3 Pokemon games are not mainline titles: 

1 Colosseum/XD

3 PLA

4 Diamond/Pearl


The first real mainline title on my list is sitting at N4. 

I WISH TPC would actually care to expand the Pokemon videogame universe. I absolutely lived the idea of Colosseum and XD. And if you like Pokemon soundtracks, those games had the absolute best bangers. Your main character, while a bit edgy, fit the game universe and IRL era (punk/rock style) PERFECTLY! The tone was more serious without being unadapted for children. I was around 10-11 when they came out. 

There was stuff I didn’t like, like the total absence of wild pokemon and the VERY LIMITED amount of them in XD later on. And that’s exactly why I would love more of this in the future. Expand on the theme and universe. 

Same for PLA. It is the closest I’ve had to fun with a Pokemon title since the Colosseum/XD days. It was unfortunately ruined by overwhelmingly bad performance, really outdated visuals ( which are as jarring as they are because of the lack of a fitting artstyle and art direction). I can still play Windwaker and say I still like the visual style today. Nothing like that could be said about PLA.  Performance wise it shouldn’ t be allowed on the Switch. It performs worse than a game in it’s early access/alpha/beta stage. But the gameplay loop and idea was fun. Gamefreak can do cool things when they dare to get out of their comfort zone and try to explore something new. The mainline gimmicks like Mega evo, Z moves or Gmax/tera are not daring something new. But the actual dangers of being around wild pokemon, and include it into gameplay is cool and new. We finally get what professor oak’s meant to tell us back in the days if red and blue! 

I think the reason why I’ve been enjoying mainline games less and less since Pearl/Dismond is just that those games (one can argue it’s white/black) reached the peak of what the pokemon formula can do back in the DS days. Scarlet/Violet tried changing a few things while staying safe after seeing the success of Arceus. Sword Shield did not do that and you won’t convince me otherwise. It’s corridors separated by the occasional big safari zone. That’s nothing daring. 

Sorry, I went and wrote a bible about this…
                    for what it's worth, i wasn't taking it personally or as an insult, since i am not Pokemon Legends Arceus. and I agree that the soundtracks for the gamecube games were fantastic, i wish they'd hire the composer again
                        I feel like almost any pokemon content creator will use those soundtracks as background music in their videos.
                    > Diamond/Pearl

What? Those are Gen 4 and are clearly Mainline Games.
                        I meant to say top 3. Apologies.
Edit: in my defense, I ranked Colosseum/XD at 1, PLA at 3 and DP at 4. 
Edited the first post for what it’s worth.
                    it absolutely is not a mainline title, no matter what people say.

its the closest a spinoff has been so far, but its a different, simplified battle system and thats really all that matters.
            BDSP and Let’s Go didn’t have meaningful online either and those are mainline. 
                Those are remakes of mainline games. While those were treated like the mainline games in the 3DS days, that has no longer been the case on the switch. 

Let’s go is not a mainline series, it was a casual level entry game to hook some Go players to the main franchise (nothing negative, let’s go is probably one of my favourite pokemon titles on the  switch after PLA)

BDSP was… something I guess?
                    nope, definitely still considered mainline

edit: double checked, and yup, bulbapedia even agrees listing them with core series titles for entries rather than side series
                        Ok
                            I understand your point and I am right there with you. People can call them mainline all they want but tbh they really weren't treated that way.
                                Except everybody asked when Let’s Go was released if it was mainline, they said yes and also the national Pokédex will not come back, yet nobody cared. One year later everyone was surprised the national Pokédex wasn’t there in Sword & Shield.
                                    You’re just repeating what I already know and what others have said. I am not saying no one said it’s a mainline game. I am just saying I understand the point that person is trying to make. The national dex issue is not one I care about though tbh, it never bothered me.
        Puzzling? Pokemon is a yearly cash cow, why support a game that sold well, when they can crank out the next one? Maybe Palworld has me a little salty lol
            Isn’t palworld like two weeks old..?
                Yeah, and already has more support than the newest pokemon in terms of optimization and free content updates. The fact that GF has been milking a game that literally has sections that run at less than 10fps, and looks like a child programmed it in Alice isn't great, compared to a game with less than a 7mil budget and a team of 40 devs
    No *paid* DLC. They had their big Daybreak DLC which added a rogue-lite side game, massive mass outbreaks, and various additional extras (cosmetics, trainer fights, etc.).
        Oh shit I think I missed that. Might need to revisit, was thinking about another play through anyway. Is that side game any good?
            It's basically an infinite gauntlet where you earn points based on Pokemon fights. You are given a list of potential pokemon teams to fight and how many points each team is worth. The harder the team, the more points you earn.  You can then spend those points on buffs and healing in between fights. You will eventually lose as the price of things get higher every time you buy them meaning you will eventually be left with no way to heal your pokemon or recharge their PP for moves. (creates a good space to experiment with crappy moves who's only redeeming quality is very high PP)

You get items based on how far you get.

It's interesting enough, nothing amazing. The biggest issue is that the rewards are good, but not great. You don't earn anything that makes the mode a "must do" which may be for the best if you're not good at it. 

The massive mass outbreaks have some of the best shiny odds in the whole series. (though shiny sandwich hunting during outbreaks in S/V may be equivalent, I don't know the numbers)
                [Massive mass outbreaks are worse than regular mass outbreaks in Arceus](https://twitter.com/Sibuna_Switch/status/1498056331315625984), but they are [better than any method in SV](https://twitter.com/Sibuna_Switch/status/1602047739751432192) outside of events.
                    On the whole, it's inferior to hunting in SV because in SV the spawns come and go infinitely, whereas in PLA they are very limited in number until the outbreak ends. But still cool though
            Definitely! It’s the best postgame battle mode since Battle Tree in Sun/Moon. Kinda reminds me of the Battle Castle in Platinum’s BF
    The two games I've enjoyed the most this gen were Let's Go and Legends and I'm a bit concerned these games are the only ones that we're going to get.
    On Game Freak's tiny ass team? Nah, they're too busy working on their next shitty mainline title.
        Why is that still the excuse? Game Freak has to be making more money than any other game developer, and they're backed by the most prolific advertising/Licensing company on the planet.
            They're basically scheduled to pump out a new game every year, and the studio doesn't have the support to maximize their quality with this kind of timeframe. The games have been dropping in quality for years.
                It’s not that the studio doesn’t have the support, it’s the studio doesn’t want to do anything about it.
            Its helpful once you acknowledge that the games are just ads for the merch at this point, not unlike saturday morning cartoons of your childhood.
                Right. I've known that for awhile. I'm just tired of hearing "games bad because game freak smol"
                    Alas its "games bad because theres no incentive to be good"
            It's not an excuse. Nintendo and TPCI keep them small purposefully so they can have a regular release schedule. They don't care about growing the games. They only care about growing the franchise. They only need new characters every couple of years so they can sell plushies, trading cards, and TV shows. To them the games are simply an entry point for people to spend more money. Hopefully one day they learn the hard way.
                >Nintendo and TPCI keep them small purposefully so they can have a regular release schedule

No, Game Freak stays small because their higher ups prefer small teams. They're bad managers who don't want the responsibility of managing enough people to make a good game, and they have no reason to change because no matter what they squeeze out, everyone will buy it.
                Everyone's got opinions on why Pokémon games have been getting worse and worse, I know I have my own.  

But you'd think Nintendo would push back for higher quality, despite how well the games continue to sell.  Nintendo is known to be very protective of their IPs.  They know the reputational damage that can come from releasing an unfinished game to meet a deadline, and that a good game is appreciated even if released later than expected.  

I know Nintendo isn't solely in charge of Pokemon, but you'd think they'd have some sway at TPCI to say "Look, these games are not Nintendo quality, we need to do better."

I really wonder what is *really* causing the quality of the latest Pokémon games to be declining so much.  I thought they were really on the right track after Legends: Arceus, but the we got Scarlet/Violet that felt like they took two steps back from what they did with Legends: Arceus.
                    I had a lot of fun with Legends Arceus, but there was still plenty wrong with it. Thankfully performance was much better than SV, but it still looked like a PS2 game. The open world was barren (just like SV). The only reason I enjoyed it over SV was the catching mechanic was a ton of fun. But outside of that, it didnt have a ton to offer. If this were an indie developed title, I’d say it was a great first game. But from the biggest franchise in the world? Fuck no.

And in terms of Nintendo having sway in this whole situation? Fact is we have no idea what goes on behind closed doors. Just because Nintendo is protective of most of their IPs doesn’t mean they can’t have exceptions. Pokemon is certainly an outlier with how much of a money making machine the merchandise is. And the quality of the games hasn’t put a dent in the sales. Nintendo cares about their IPs because it makes them money. If Pokemon still sells despite the quality, why should they care? And if thats not the case, that they really do care, then there aint shit they can do about it. They’re a minority stake of the brand, and they have the luxury of having the game as a console exclusive, and wouldnt want to rock the boat there. Whatever the case, its evident that nothing will change. Money talks. At best we might get a game that runs at a consistent frame rate again. Outside of that, don’t expect much.
            Nintendo does jack shit with the mainline series and it's unfortunate. Imagine a pokemon game with the same quality of Zelda or Mario games.
                Nintendo doesn't develop the games.
                    I'm referring to them as developers who also own part of the IP.
                        Nintendo aren't developers of the Pokemon games. Saying "Nintendo does jack shit" and comparing them to zelda or mario projects is irrelevant. Mario and zelda projects have multi year development time, and their release isn't timed to coincide with anime and merchandise. The pokemon release schedule is handled by the pokemon company, which operates independently of nintendo other than the fact that nintendo owns a share of that company. The games are developed by game freak, once again an independent game studio that nintendo owns a part of but does not control in any way. It would be more accurate to point the blame at the pokemon company, who are focused on pumping out annual pokemon titles and game freak who do not have enough experience on next gen systems to bring the quality up to a better standard.
    For real, it's crazy that they decided to not support the game that people were much more excited about and didn't have controversy around it.
    So crazy to me. I was very ready to open my wallet for this game. Am ready, honestly.
    I've been wishing for DLC for ages :( or at least another game in the series. If we see no more Legends content ever, I will be extremely disappointed
    Why would there be. This was appealing to me because it was a nice contained adventure from day one.
    God damn thanks there was no dlc for the game.

It really sucks the energy out of me every game I've 100%d suddenly has DLC that slaps that completion aside.
    For the side titles, they usually don't do DLC for. Mainline seems to only get the DLCs.
    I paused playing this game hoping for DLC. I should re start and try again. I really loved the first 5 hrs I played
    They had free update that added alot of new stuff.
This game was 100% a step in the right direction for pokemon. Scarlet and Violet were probably to late in development to pivot to a game more in this style. 

Here is to hoping the next main line pokemon game takes a lot of ideas from arceus and actually expands them and adds. Probably not though!
    To me the game felt like they were testing the waters.

We’ve seen it with the “open world” wild area of Sword and Shield. Tested the waters, then boom Scarlet and Violet is entirely open world.

Or it’s just that Gamefreak like to edge us and the next mainline will be open world AND have level scaling. Holding back features to make it seem like they’re innovating.
        [deleted]
            Possibly. But the next generation have probably been in development since before SV were released.
    if this game came out after SV I don't think anyone would've batted an eye, even though the world is smaller and not fully open there's a lot more to do, and besides that it's just so much more improved on a technical level. like they literally redid all the battle animations which we were begging for in SwSh.
    I agree, I really hope from the success of both games and the vocal positives and negatives from both games they focus fire on that for the next one.  

Also whatever the next remake they do is gonna be interesting.
        My hope is they don't do a remake and the next game is a second Legends game launching on Switch 2 so it can be more demanding or look better or larger. And then that followed by a main line pokemon game that actually spins the whole series on its head and takes a lot of risks

With the controlling your pokemon mechanic added in SV I'm a little worried they might do the Final Fantasy and make it so the future of pokemon is controlling them and fighting in real time. Which would be super cool but I don't know if game freak can pull it off
    >Probably not though!

This really kills me, lol. Love Pokemon, but the last one that was really great IMO was probably B/W2. They really need to... evolve.... (👉⁰▽⁰)👉. Or just start other teams so they can each have longer dev cycles on remakes + mainlines-- the frequency of their releases may just be too high if they want to put out something of quality.
        They do actually. 2 teams. One handles core series games and the other remakes, DLC, 3rd games etc. Thing is that they just release games back to back and trade.
    Classic two steps forward, one step back.
    Disagree, SV took all the best bits already. I don’t want to. Catch 20 of the same pokemon to fill the pokedex and the battle mechanics were too shallow
        then why is sv garbage and pla isnt?
            SV is the best polemon game since bw2, the story is great, the battle mechanics are deep and interesting, all the QOL for competitive is awesome. Just looks like ass
    EXACTLY MY DMBASS THOUGHT SNV WOJLD BE LIK ARCEUS 😭
It was several steps in the right direction at least, but they still have some way to go
    Such as making the games look like they didn't come out 20 years ago.

Seriously by 2004 we had Final Fantasy XII, Halo 2, Half-Life 2, Metroid Prime, etc. which both look and ran better than Pokemon.
    Definitelly. Gamefreak is a indie company yet, I hope they learn something or take some inspiration from Pocket Pair on their next releases. /s/s/s
The most fun I’ve had with a Pokémon game in years. If the performance and graphics were better, this would’ve been a stellar game. Thinking of it with graphics like Monster Hunter just makes me sigh wistfully.
    This was me with Violet version as well. Two Pokémon games that you could just *see* the potential of came out within the same year and I enjoyed them greatly yet felt they were just "almost there" in a few things that would have made them both masterpieces.
        Yea I agree. I understand why many rag on modern pokemon and how gamefreak isn't some small indie company, but these 2 games clearly demonstrate how they're finally starting to bring the series in a new direction and not enough people are giving credit where it's due. They're obviously behind the curve when they shouldn't be, but that doesn't mean you can't enjoy the games for what they are considering at least part of their true vision shines through. The intent shines enough to the point where the games are still fun despite their shortcomings.

I wouldn't mind them pivoting to an HD2D style though if it means it doesn't have spaghetti code
            They don't give credit because it's obvious that they could do much more but aren't because they don't really need to.
                100% true. Sad to see everyone so eager to defend gamefreak for such mid games
                >it's obvious that they could do much more but aren't because they don't really need to

I personally don't understand so many people jumping to this conclusion. This implies that they did the bare minimum, but making a full on open world is obviously more than that. Its stability didn't turn out the best, but lets not ignore the fact that they just could've copy pasted the same linear formula as they always have. This is my main problem with this line of criticism that nobody has a proper logical justification for. They ignore the game's actual design and chalk up poor stability to laziness when they are not directly correlated.

Lets also not forget that pokemon is a franchise where everything is lined up around the games, so even if gamefreak wanted to delay them so they have more time, they literally cannot. That combined with the fact that they were primarily handheld developers jumping to console resulted to what we have now. This isn't a full excuse, but it's important to factor in the circumstances.
    Most fun I had since Ruby
    Same. Imagine how even better it would be if it wasn't a "side game" and had more effort put into it.
LOL this game absolutely does waste your time

&#x200B;

I still had a fun time with it tho :)
    Agreed! I feel like all the dialogue for this game is three times longer than it needs to be. Everyone just won’t stop talking. I had fun but my god does it waste time.
        YES
    Yeah especially at the beginning. Once you get past that it is the most fun I’ve had with a Pokémon game since gen 3.
        Wait, is there less dialogue later in the game? I hate the amount of dialogue so far. I stopped playing 🙁
    That tutorial is the stuff of nightmares, but the actual battles and catch system is buttery smooth, it does cut a lot of the bs out
    I couldn't get past the tutorial with how slow it is. Give me movement abilities right away!
    Well when you're used to mainline pokémon games, this one looks lightning fast, even though it still has time wasters.
    Came here to make this comment hahaha. It’s like an hour tutorial. 

But he is right that it is an amazing pokemon game. It is miles and miles better than scarlet/violet
I agree with most of what you had to say about this game. It was a nice step forward for Pokémon and I enjoyed it. But after playing Scarlet/Violet I was so disappointed with how little they focused on towns and structures. The world felt so empty. Once I completed the game I never really felt like coming back to the game as I did with sword and shield. Not even mention how bad the game ran in general. I also disliked how they kept a big chunk of Pokémon out of the games (Sword & Shield and Scarlet/Violet) so that they could include them in DLC. That's just dirty considering it was proven that they just used the 3DS models and upscaled them.
It was a good proof of concept, but not a well built game. It looks like some early access stuff with the barren and boring landscape
    I've played a lot of early access games that looked 10x better than arceus. It's cool to see gamefreak doing something substantially different, but goddamn did this game feel half-assed to me. I'd love to see the Pokemon company put a little bit more of their boundless wealth into developing a game at some point, and maybe allow for more than 1 year of development time. I think I'm out on the series unless I see some more substantial change.
        Why change the formula if everyone is already buying the game? The Pokemon playerbase says they won't buy the next game but preorder every time, then on launch make posts about how Game Freak cheated them out of their money.
            Yep lol. I hadn't bought a game prior to arceus since platinum, but they have such a massive fanbase that will buy anything with the pokemon name on it that there's no pressure for them to improve their product. I get why they pump out the low effort garbage they do, from a business perspective, I just wish they'd do better for my own nostalgic reasons. But I guess I'll have to look elsewhere to scratch that monster collector itch.
    I think what makes it feel that way to me is the jarring inconsistency throughout its runtime. Whilst it looks a bit rough throughout, graphically, areas three and four are hideous due to rushed and mismatched terrain assets. Mechanically, field pokémon stop getting meaningful individualised catch mechanics after the first area! Look at the likes of Abra and Mr Mime. These are unique and force strategic gameplay. You don't see this level of species specific field behaviour again until the postgame legends.


Arceus was an excellent proof of concept but you can't help but wonder what it could have been with another six months development to not even fix the graphical performance but just fill out the content holes.
I never even played Pokémon, and even I found this game fun
    I know pokemon usually appeals to new players a lot more than regulars but legends was one of the few games I could genuinely recommend just on how fresh and fun it was.
Every boss battle becoming a dodge & throw fest lost the appeal quickly
    Which is what, 0.5% of the game?
        Okay I’ll talk about the other 95.5%:

The Pokemon move pool is severely reduced 

No Pokemon abilities or held items 

Pokédex completion is extremely repetitive 

Zones are bland and empty, and the one town hub is lifeless 

The most exciting part of the game is the time distortion events that involve a lot of WAITING around because there’s no manual way to trigger them
            Agree with this. My least favourite Pokemon game on Switch.
            It's a side series that's slimmed down and more focused on action. If you want the slower, tactical version you still have the main series.
                Poster: The action is repetitive and becomes uninteresting

Response: That's only a small part of the game

Poster: The rest of the game is pretty minimal and bland

Response: Well the game is focused on action

Legends Arceus was fine, but the Pokemon community is so desperate for anything interesting that they give this game way too much credit. It feels like a tech demo for what could be a great game, which unfortunately is what most GameFreak games feel like.
                    Agreed. This game is basic as it gets but it just so happens the other Pokémon games are so bad that this looks like a masterpiece in comparison.
Palworld is so much better!
    You're getting downvoted but I mean you are correct.
    [deleted]
        Yeah its better! Turn based is boring af!
One of the things I love about the game is that you can see the pokemon is a shiny without even having to enter combat. Blew my mind & hyped me up when I turned around in one of the ruins & blam! there was a shiny!Ralts for me.

Really would be great if they do this same thing for other regions too - want to see what an alternative Unova would be like.
All the Palworld talk got me craving returning to this game actually.  Jumped in last night for the first time since shortly after it released.
    If you like Arceus and have a device to play Palworld on, I think it’s worth a try. I’m a few hours in and it’s fun so far with some Arceus-like vibes.
        I believe Palworld is what Arceus should have been. Palworld is the most fun I've had a game in a long time. Daydreaming at work about it, looking up videos, reading guides. Ah
            Would love another Legends game to borrow ideas from Palworld.

Its the best modern Pokemon game imo and I was so dissapointed when s/v came out because it felt like they went backwards.
Yep, it's a great game.
If this wasn't named 'Pokemon' it would just be an alright game. Pokemon fans are so accostumed to the same games, that anything in another direction will make them happy, and its understandable because the situation with Pokemon Comp and Gamefreak.

Is this an amazing game? No, it isn't. Graphics are normal to mediocre, with bad optimization, popping and lazy texturing.

Gameplay loop and new battle system are great and refreshing, but boss battles (tame the big poke by throwing endless dust bags) are uninspiring and too easy.

I wish they took some years to develop a second one.
My favorite pokemon game in some time. Has its issues, but tried a lot of really cool things and did most of them pretty well.

Wish mainline would learn from that.

For me what I liked the most was the removal of any RNG component towards EV/IV, it just removes any will for me starting a new Pokémon game knowing my first 20/30hours will be wasted, tho I can understand it’s the meta and endgame for many.

I would have kept abilities tho, because it turned many Pokémon useless unfortunately
Man I hated the early grind of this game, catching a Pokémon over and over does nothing for me
I enjoyed this one more than the last two mainline titles
This is my favorite new gen Pokemon game. I love the story and the open world aspect of it. I wished they stuck with this gameplay mechanics.
Oh man. I fucking loved this game. People who moan about pokemon seem to have forgotten about this gem! I also have strong nostalgia for it already too.
I have always had trouble getting into Pokemon. I have tried a few of the mainline games, each time hoping it would click for me but it never does (tried Black, Omega Ruby, Sun, and Sword). But Arceus just instantly hooked me. I tried Scarlet hoping it would be similar but once again it didnt really draw me in. I am hoping for a new "Legends" title on the next Switch.
It's a really interesting proof of concept piece that I fully expect they'll never do anything interesting with
tbh not being able to skip dialogues kind of sucks but I agree that the game’s overall great
It was hard for me to overlook the technical issues but by the first time the credits roll I felt like I was over it... restarted it to see if I'd feel a bit better about it but didn't go far. Sold it. It's an ok experience for people like me who gave up after Black and White but it isn't good enough.
    Interesting proof-of-concept of mechanics that *could* be used for a more complete pokemon game, but overall is just incomplete. Feels like the best pokemon game in years since it is actually expanding on what a pokemon game could look like, but is still incomplete in almost every other aspect.
Only way Pokémon will get more money out of me is another Legends game.
It was fun. Definitely superior to anything else Gamefreak has put out recently. But if you compare it to the gaming industry as a whole (instead of just comparing it against the other Pokemon games) it was pretty mid. Derivative style, trying to be BOTW but with a ton of added jank, no true open world, etc.
A top 5 Switch game for me, it's incredible.
    What is your top 5 if i may ask
        It's a pretty vanilla list for me:

Super Smash Bros. Ultimate

Splatoon 2 (for now, 3 may be here instead after the Side Order DLC)

Mario Odyssey

Zelda BOTW

Pokemon Arceus
Kinda disagree here, the old games are way better imo.
(this game doesnt waste players time)Proceeds to have a 4 hours tutorial
    I didn't explain it properly, but I mean in comparison with the older tittles.
    I'm thinking about getting it because of this thread even thought I know about the criticism. I didn't know about a 4 hour tutorial, is that true?
        By memory, it was a long tutorial. I would say 2/3 hours.
This was a mid game
My time in Arceus was mostly clicking through boring cringey dialogues and running around a bland copy paste landscape. I felt like the game was wasting my time for the vast majority of the playtime. Admittedly it was innovative for Pokemon and showed promise for the series actually progressing. 

Palworld is a much more fun take on the idea. You don't waste any time, get right into it, catching feels snappy and the pals animations all give them a ton of personality. Sure it's not doing the same things as a pokemon game all the time, but I got every achievement in Palworld vs putting my copy of Arceus away to collect dust halfway through.
    I agree about the dialogues. And about Palworld, I've only heard good things about it. I'll definitely give it a try soon.
I hate how this game is excluded when I hear complaints about pokemon never innovating or making the same game every year. The game sells like hot cakes and they have no reason to change the formula yet they bothered to try and it turned out great imo. I hate how fast the game died. I wish it had DLC and SV could have come out a year later.
Best Pokemon game ever
This game was boring as hell. Runs terrible, shit story and missions.
I also really enjoyed the new forms of almost every pokemon (looking at you Dialga), to the point that without noticing my team was 5/6 Hisuian Pokemon!  


Looking for the specific mons, like Zorua, was super fun in the overworld and felt very rewarding. Also randomly finding Chimchar - my frist starter - while running around was such a nice feeling. I also enjoyed the pokemon choice, while not having a huge pokedex it incorporated some of the most forgotten yet interesting pokemon from a lot of regions. It didnt rely too heavily on nostalgia while keeping everything that made a pokemon game fun. It's a step in the right direction for sure! I would love a Legend Kyurem
I might be the only one on the planet that enjoys Violet more than Legends. The DLC has added a lot of replay value IMO
I got this for Xmas just gone and it's brilliant, easily the most fun with a Pokemon game I've had in probably like 10 years
You should try Palworld. Similar but better and cheaper
    It’s not though is it? Played it. It’s quite buggy and cheap and too much building and no battling. The art style clashes too. Nothing like pokemon
        It is in a sense that exploration is the main thing to do, and that catching 10 of the same Pals gives a huge XP gain. Art is subjective but for what Palworld is presenting seems to mesh well imo. I am playing the steam version with 2 other friends and ive generally have 60fps aside from being at base with multiple Pals doing tasks
        L m a o

That's gotta be a troll, you cannot have said that seriously
            No troll. My experience
                The thing is, except for ''too much building not enough battling'' the rest 1000% applies to pokemon
Maybe it’s just me being older. I don’t know. I’ve played Pokémon since the red/blue days on the original Gameboy. I haven’t kept up with the most recent main line additions, but my kids wanted this game. I found it to be an absolute disappointment. It’s just kind of a grind, and not a fun game at all. The visuals are abysmal. Travel is kind of meh. And leveling up Pokémon is damn near impossible- it’s better just to find the one you like at a harder level. 

Again, maybe I just outgrew Pokémon and didn’t realize it until now.
Having recently got Palworld, all it really did was make me want to go back and play Arceus again.

I guess the creatures actually being pokémon and not legally distinct knockoffs really matters to me.
Who tryna pick up my satchel for me
Ah, the first Palworld.
It walked so Palworld could run
Honestly incredible game. My dream Pokemon game, I think the only one I had more fun with is ORAS for all its connectivity features and endgame.
"**This game is amazing!"**

\- n64 graphics in 2022 by the most profitable franchise in the world

\- no voiceacting in 2022

\- dead world

\- terrible enviroments

\- terrible characters

\- terrible pacing

\- dead town

\- made with zero love, literally just a tech demo

\- one big fetch quest

\- 60 dollars while every 10 dollar indie game has more quality to offer
    I agree with you about  the Voice acting, I forgot n to write this in the review, but a think it's about time for them to make it happen.
Careful, you're being positive about a Pokemon game
Highly considering picking up both this and Violet over the weekend. But I know I should probably only get one.
    Violet/Scarlet are not really strong games at all imo.
    Honestly neither are worth 60 bucks imo you are better off getting something else
        Think I’m going to finally dive into the Xenoblade Chronicles games
            Honestly good choice, I played all 3 and if you like rpgs with an amazing story and fun exploration, they are very worth it.
Glad people enjoy it but I think it’s incredibly average though I do agree it’s a step in the right direction
Me: Arceus is so good, I hope SV will follow suit and do better
SV: ...
I want another Pokémon legends game
Damn I’m excited I just rented this from the library today. Can’t wait to try, was hesitant at first
    Rented from the library!?! What year is this!?!
        really man, my library has literally every game for all systems really. Way better than purchasing and having to sell it after. Just whipped through Luigi Mansion 3 in January. Perfect for me since typically when I finish a game I hardly ever play it back.
I love this game
I enjoyed my time with it but I couldn't get past the performance issues after 20 or so hours.
Ginormous fall off with the next Pokémon game. In terms of gameplay loop and atmosphere.
Yeah it's the only Pokemon game I've ever enjoyed which says a lot.

Well not as enjoyable as Palworld but close
Eh, like all modern pokemon games it falls off quickly if you want anything with more depth than a puddle.

It was a good step towards trying something new with the series, but it needs to be iterated on and improved upon as a game.
>This game doesn't waste player's time

That's a bold claim for a game that needs over an hour before it starts going.
    Maybe I didn't explain it right, but I mean in comparison to the old Pokémon games.
There's some cool stuff in it that I'd like to see adopted for future mainline Pokemon games, but I feel like the overall gameplay loop was a complete drag.  I hated having to catch the same Pokemon over and over and over just to be able to progress through the game, and having to deal with crafting/resource-gathering on top of that was tedious as hell.

I think the overall idea of going back in time to an older era of a familiar region is cool, but I'm honestly not sure I'd want another game in the Legends line, because the best concepts it had could just be used for the next mainline Pokemon game.  Plus Game Freak can barely even manage to pump out functional games as it is, so I'd rather see them put all of their efforts into a single game rather than trying to have another series developed by them running alongside the mainline games.
"This game doesn't waste player's time"

No, It does :'(((((  Having Most and longest dialog/conversation/cutsenses game I have ever play (except MGS-PoP). And you cant skip :'(((
Op seems like the guy who says Scarlet and violet was bad but buys the game anyway. 

A big problem with the Pokémon community is their standard for the games. They are so starved for innovation and quality that anything that’s slightly in the right direction becomes a good game.
    Exactly! ..and unfortunately, you and I will be both downvoted for stating the truth about the fact that this franchise is nowhere close to being where it should be after nearly 3 decades of continuous support from its fanbase.. you would think people would want to acknowledge this so that we can start getting a GREAT pokemon game, versus the continued mediocrity as of late.
        Yep. That’s the Reddit echo chamber for ya

I really hope the next gen gets it right and does it justice. With the amount of money they’re making their games should at the very least be super polished, even with the switch limitations.
You should try Palworld
Kinda sounds like Palworld without guns
straight up my favorite Pokemon game of all time tbh, whether you're catching or battling the game just feels satisfying and snappy to play
I dont hate it, but really it only is adequate when in comparison to the games that followed it.. Tbh, it feels like the dev's put in the bare minimum work to get a passing grade. It definitely didnt go above and beyond the basic expectations we should have for this franchise..certainly not anywhere near where this franchise should be after nearly 30 years of considerable support from its fans! Love pokemon, but jeeze they really need to step up!
Disagree with op. I played Arceus for 15 hours, it felt like an empty tech demo.
I feel like it’s pretty awful, poor man’s version of smt v
Recently played this for the first time, and while it is a lot of fun--I really disliked the forced pacing of the story with relation to your level. I don't have as much time to game as I'd like, and so I don't always want to use what little time I have to try and grind/level-up just to continue the story.
How could you possibly enjoy this game when Redditors told me this game is bad? /s
I still don’t think this is the direction they should go in for the main generation games. Spinoff it works perfectly as.
Game freak should have pivoted and put more money into supporting this game.

Now you have real competition like Pal World, but it's a different game.

If Gen 1 and 2 were remade with Arceus mechanics and open world. That'd be incredible. Then have other regions as expansions /dlc, full priced but you're able to catch all the pokemon in the pokedex.
I just went back and played through it for the 2nd time but on SteamDeck this time. Such an awesome game and really hope we see more like it in the future.
As far as I’m concerned this is the most fun pokemon game ever created. I absolutely love it.
Pal world better
With more time to improve the performance, and to add a bit more content variety I really think this game would've soared.


As it stands though, quite a good game! I'd easily rank this in my Top 5 for mainline Pokemon games, it's just so much fun. I hadn't gotten a new game in the series since Sun and Moon and LA brought me back to being an active fan of the series.


Also the visuals are at least better than S/V. They tried to emulate a painting style I'm not going to Google (sorry, but this is a reddit comment) and I think it works pretty nicely for what it is.
i want to get this game, but my problem with pokemon games is the lack of or very short end game content.

i think it was x and y that had the pokemon restaurant and costume contests. those kind of repeatable challenges with some rng give me so much replayability.

does pokemon legends arceus have anything like that? a pokemon battle tower with random trainers or something?

my idea of replay value isn't starting a video game over or doing some gimmick like nuzlocke.
Best Pokémon Game on Switch by far
I just got this game today.  Excited to try it finally!
I thought that every new Pokemon game would follow this formula and have been disappointed with every subsequent Pokemon release.
Best pokemon game since black/white2, hands down. Huge letdown we had no ability to have battles with other people, let alone trade and series staples like that - I'd LOVE to see the battle system in 1v1 and 2v2s against humans!

Palworld actually did scratch a lot of that itch for something with a botw style open world to explore and pokemon like things you are interacting with directly, rather than turn based. Really, really fun game if you can get over all the weird contrarianism stolen glory whatever hate thrown at it.
Is level grinding still same as OG Pokemon games ? Auto or simulate battle feature ?
It was aite. This post is overcompensating for something...
Hello Nintendo, err... I mean paparoxo...

But for real, yeah it's good. It's funny to see Arceus vs scarlet/violet.
I miss the old way to shiny hunt
This is my favorite pikemon game that I've played, despite the relatively empty world and low texture visuals. They managed to make catching pokemon very enjoyable, with lots of QOL features I wasn't expecting. So much so that when they announced Scarlet and Violet I didn't even both because I don't want to go back to the old style of Pokemon.
Adored this game. I somehow even got Arceus in it?! I hope a sequel will come soon.
I LOVED this game. Completed everything there was to complete and started shiny hunting at the end. I really hope they make another one in a different region or something.
> for sure has problems, like low textures and a lot of pop-in, low framerate Pokémon at distance, and the lack of character's animations, like in the main village where the NPCs stand still making it fell less alive, and instead of animate some scenes, Game Freak opts to black out the screen.

I remember my friends being pretty bummed that "if botw has an open world with way more detail, we shouldn't settle for low textures etc... in Arceus.  
which to their point I agree but I felt like for all the "lack of effort" we get from Game Freak in that department, the game play and game as a whole was a lot of fun. I personally enjoyed this pokemon game rather than scarlet/violet. That may be the freshness of a different game set up then the previous pokemon entries but I would love another pokemon game like arceus.
my biggest issue with the mainline games is that there is no new game+. 

pokeMMO hit the nail on the head with their "new game+" gameplay after you've beaten all the gyms. All the gyms are harder and require more strategy and gives me more pokemon to play. catching them all isn't fun if there isn't anything to do with them except online.
EXACTLY OWN THOSE SNV FRAUDS
Definitely the best pokemon game of the last 10 years. 

Got alot right if they improved the performance and graphics of this game in a sequel and maybe polished some other stuff a bit more it would be a masterpiece.
Best pokemon i played in years, got 200h+
Ironically, your first sentence about the game not wasting the players time, is exactly why I stopped playing. I thought there was way too much dialogue and hand holding the first hour or so and I lost interest fast. Looks like I’ll have to circle back and give it another try!
Is Pokémon Sword and Shield worth playing? How do they compare to this?
    I haven't played it, but I believe Sword and Shield follow the old  formula, with the only difference being the addition of open areas with Pokémon (no random encounters). However, I don't think it provides the  same level of freedom as Legends Arceus does.
I caught all the mons to get arceous. The day o got my switch I got pokemon violet played it that night returned it and got arceous knowing nothing and fell in love immediately, definitely  a great take on pokemon amd wish there were more
this game is good, not a big fan of the post game tho… it’s a good Blueprint for a perfect game
I hate that I can't simply walk two steps without an NPC interrupting me for a tip or a chit chat, and you need to go to the city everytime you want to change maps.

But minor problems aside, I would love if Sca/Vio and Swo/Shi were half of the amazing game that PLA is.
yeah, the utter lack of long term support it got is just puzzling.
    Because they didn’t develop any meaningful ranked or online mode for it. People still say it’s a « mainline » game, it didn’t get any treatment of a mainline series. GF can say it is a main line series game but they didn’t treat it as such.
        Rather than try to defer it as a side game, I'd say it expands what it means to be a mainline pokemon game.

Besides, it added new pokemon and has full connectivity with Home and the other mainline games.
            I don’t understand why some people take it as an insult or personal when I say a game is not a mainline title. My top 3 Pokemon games are not mainline titles: 

1 Colosseum/XD

3 PLA

4 Diamond/Pearl


The first real mainline title on my list is sitting at N4. 

I WISH TPC would actually care to expand the Pokemon videogame universe. I absolutely lived the idea of Colosseum and XD. And if you like Pokemon soundtracks, those games had the absolute best bangers. Your main character, while a bit edgy, fit the game universe and IRL era (punk/rock style) PERFECTLY! The tone was more serious without being unadapted for children. I was around 10-11 when they came out. 

There was stuff I didn’t like, like the total absence of wild pokemon and the VERY LIMITED amount of them in XD later on. And that’s exactly why I would love more of this in the future. Expand on the theme and universe. 

Same for PLA. It is the closest I’ve had to fun with a Pokemon title since the Colosseum/XD days. It was unfortunately ruined by overwhelmingly bad performance, really outdated visuals ( which are as jarring as they are because of the lack of a fitting artstyle and art direction). I can still play Windwaker and say I still like the visual style today. Nothing like that could be said about PLA.  Performance wise it shouldn’ t be allowed on the Switch. It performs worse than a game in it’s early access/alpha/beta stage. But the gameplay loop and idea was fun. Gamefreak can do cool things when they dare to get out of their comfort zone and try to explore something new. The mainline gimmicks like Mega evo, Z moves or Gmax/tera are not daring something new. But the actual dangers of being around wild pokemon, and include it into gameplay is cool and new. We finally get what professor oak’s meant to tell us back in the days if red and blue! 

I think the reason why I’ve been enjoying mainline games less and less since Pearl/Dismond is just that those games (one can argue it’s white/black) reached the peak of what the pokemon formula can do back in the DS days. Scarlet/Violet tried changing a few things while staying safe after seeing the success of Arceus. Sword Shield did not do that and you won’t convince me otherwise. It’s corridors separated by the occasional big safari zone. That’s nothing daring. 

Sorry, I went and wrote a bible about this…
                for what it's worth, i wasn't taking it personally or as an insult, since i am not Pokemon Legends Arceus. and I agree that the soundtracks for the gamecube games were fantastic, i wish they'd hire the composer again
                    I feel like almost any pokemon content creator will use those soundtracks as background music in their videos.
                > Diamond/Pearl

What? Those are Gen 4 and are clearly Mainline Games.
                    I meant to say top 3. Apologies.
Edit: in my defense, I ranked Colosseum/XD at 1, PLA at 3 and DP at 4. 
Edited the first post for what it’s worth.
                it absolutely is not a mainline title, no matter what people say.

its the closest a spinoff has been so far, but its a different, simplified battle system and thats really all that matters.
        BDSP and Let’s Go didn’t have meaningful online either and those are mainline. 
            Those are remakes of mainline games. While those were treated like the mainline games in the 3DS days, that has no longer been the case on the switch. 

Let’s go is not a mainline series, it was a casual level entry game to hook some Go players to the main franchise (nothing negative, let’s go is probably one of my favourite pokemon titles on the  switch after PLA)

BDSP was… something I guess?
                nope, definitely still considered mainline

edit: double checked, and yup, bulbapedia even agrees listing them with core series titles for entries rather than side series
                    Ok
                        I understand your point and I am right there with you. People can call them mainline all they want but tbh they really weren't treated that way.
                            Except everybody asked when Let’s Go was released if it was mainline, they said yes and also the national Pokédex will not come back, yet nobody cared. One year later everyone was surprised the national Pokédex wasn’t there in Sword & Shield.
                                You’re just repeating what I already know and what others have said. I am not saying no one said it’s a mainline game. I am just saying I understand the point that person is trying to make. The national dex issue is not one I care about though tbh, it never bothered me.
    Puzzling? Pokemon is a yearly cash cow, why support a game that sold well, when they can crank out the next one? Maybe Palworld has me a little salty lol
        Isn’t palworld like two weeks old..?
            Yeah, and already has more support than the newest pokemon in terms of optimization and free content updates. The fact that GF has been milking a game that literally has sections that run at less than 10fps, and looks like a child programmed it in Alice isn't great, compared to a game with less than a 7mil budget and a team of 40 devs
No *paid* DLC. They had their big Daybreak DLC which added a rogue-lite side game, massive mass outbreaks, and various additional extras (cosmetics, trainer fights, etc.).
    Oh shit I think I missed that. Might need to revisit, was thinking about another play through anyway. Is that side game any good?
        It's basically an infinite gauntlet where you earn points based on Pokemon fights. You are given a list of potential pokemon teams to fight and how many points each team is worth. The harder the team, the more points you earn.  You can then spend those points on buffs and healing in between fights. You will eventually lose as the price of things get higher every time you buy them meaning you will eventually be left with no way to heal your pokemon or recharge their PP for moves. (creates a good space to experiment with crappy moves who's only redeeming quality is very high PP)

You get items based on how far you get.

It's interesting enough, nothing amazing. The biggest issue is that the rewards are good, but not great. You don't earn anything that makes the mode a "must do" which may be for the best if you're not good at it. 

The massive mass outbreaks have some of the best shiny odds in the whole series. (though shiny sandwich hunting during outbreaks in S/V may be equivalent, I don't know the numbers)
            [Massive mass outbreaks are worse than regular mass outbreaks in Arceus](https://twitter.com/Sibuna_Switch/status/1498056331315625984), but they are [better than any method in SV](https://twitter.com/Sibuna_Switch/status/1602047739751432192) outside of events.
                On the whole, it's inferior to hunting in SV because in SV the spawns come and go infinitely, whereas in PLA they are very limited in number until the outbreak ends. But still cool though
        Definitely! It’s the best postgame battle mode since Battle Tree in Sun/Moon. Kinda reminds me of the Battle Castle in Platinum’s BF
The two games I've enjoyed the most this gen were Let's Go and Legends and I'm a bit concerned these games are the only ones that we're going to get.
On Game Freak's tiny ass team? Nah, they're too busy working on their next shitty mainline title.
    Why is that still the excuse? Game Freak has to be making more money than any other game developer, and they're backed by the most prolific advertising/Licensing company on the planet.
        They're basically scheduled to pump out a new game every year, and the studio doesn't have the support to maximize their quality with this kind of timeframe. The games have been dropping in quality for years.
            It’s not that the studio doesn’t have the support, it’s the studio doesn’t want to do anything about it.
        Its helpful once you acknowledge that the games are just ads for the merch at this point, not unlike saturday morning cartoons of your childhood.
            Right. I've known that for awhile. I'm just tired of hearing "games bad because game freak smol"
                Alas its "games bad because theres no incentive to be good"
        It's not an excuse. Nintendo and TPCI keep them small purposefully so they can have a regular release schedule. They don't care about growing the games. They only care about growing the franchise. They only need new characters every couple of years so they can sell plushies, trading cards, and TV shows. To them the games are simply an entry point for people to spend more money. Hopefully one day they learn the hard way.
            >Nintendo and TPCI keep them small purposefully so they can have a regular release schedule

No, Game Freak stays small because their higher ups prefer small teams. They're bad managers who don't want the responsibility of managing enough people to make a good game, and they have no reason to change because no matter what they squeeze out, everyone will buy it.
            Everyone's got opinions on why Pokémon games have been getting worse and worse, I know I have my own.  

But you'd think Nintendo would push back for higher quality, despite how well the games continue to sell.  Nintendo is known to be very protective of their IPs.  They know the reputational damage that can come from releasing an unfinished game to meet a deadline, and that a good game is appreciated even if released later than expected.  

I know Nintendo isn't solely in charge of Pokemon, but you'd think they'd have some sway at TPCI to say "Look, these games are not Nintendo quality, we need to do better."

I really wonder what is *really* causing the quality of the latest Pokémon games to be declining so much.  I thought they were really on the right track after Legends: Arceus, but the we got Scarlet/Violet that felt like they took two steps back from what they did with Legends: Arceus.
                I had a lot of fun with Legends Arceus, but there was still plenty wrong with it. Thankfully performance was much better than SV, but it still looked like a PS2 game. The open world was barren (just like SV). The only reason I enjoyed it over SV was the catching mechanic was a ton of fun. But outside of that, it didnt have a ton to offer. If this were an indie developed title, I’d say it was a great first game. But from the biggest franchise in the world? Fuck no.

And in terms of Nintendo having sway in this whole situation? Fact is we have no idea what goes on behind closed doors. Just because Nintendo is protective of most of their IPs doesn’t mean they can’t have exceptions. Pokemon is certainly an outlier with how much of a money making machine the merchandise is. And the quality of the games hasn’t put a dent in the sales. Nintendo cares about their IPs because it makes them money. If Pokemon still sells despite the quality, why should they care? And if thats not the case, that they really do care, then there aint shit they can do about it. They’re a minority stake of the brand, and they have the luxury of having the game as a console exclusive, and wouldnt want to rock the boat there. Whatever the case, its evident that nothing will change. Money talks. At best we might get a game that runs at a consistent frame rate again. Outside of that, don’t expect much.
        Nintendo does jack shit with the mainline series and it's unfortunate. Imagine a pokemon game with the same quality of Zelda or Mario games.
            Nintendo doesn't develop the games.
                I'm referring to them as developers who also own part of the IP.
                    Nintendo aren't developers of the Pokemon games. Saying "Nintendo does jack shit" and comparing them to zelda or mario projects is irrelevant. Mario and zelda projects have multi year development time, and their release isn't timed to coincide with anime and merchandise. The pokemon release schedule is handled by the pokemon company, which operates independently of nintendo other than the fact that nintendo owns a share of that company. The games are developed by game freak, once again an independent game studio that nintendo owns a part of but does not control in any way. It would be more accurate to point the blame at the pokemon company, who are focused on pumping out annual pokemon titles and game freak who do not have enough experience on next gen systems to bring the quality up to a better standard.
For real, it's crazy that they decided to not support the game that people were much more excited about and didn't have controversy around it.
So crazy to me. I was very ready to open my wallet for this game. Am ready, honestly.
I've been wishing for DLC for ages :( or at least another game in the series. If we see no more Legends content ever, I will be extremely disappointed
Why would there be. This was appealing to me because it was a nice contained adventure from day one.
God damn thanks there was no dlc for the game.

It really sucks the energy out of me every game I've 100%d suddenly has DLC that slaps that completion aside.
For the side titles, they usually don't do DLC for. Mainline seems to only get the DLCs.
I paused playing this game hoping for DLC. I should re start and try again. I really loved the first 5 hrs I played
They had free update that added alot of new stuff.
To me the game felt like they were testing the waters.

We’ve seen it with the “open world” wild area of Sword and Shield. Tested the waters, then boom Scarlet and Violet is entirely open world.

Or it’s just that Gamefreak like to edge us and the next mainline will be open world AND have level scaling. Holding back features to make it seem like they’re innovating.

        Possibly. But the next generation have probably been in development since before SV were released.
if this game came out after SV I don't think anyone would've batted an eye, even though the world is smaller and not fully open there's a lot more to do, and besides that it's just so much more improved on a technical level. like they literally redid all the battle animations which we were begging for in SwSh.
I agree, I really hope from the success of both games and the vocal positives and negatives from both games they focus fire on that for the next one.  

Also whatever the next remake they do is gonna be interesting.
    My hope is they don't do a remake and the next game is a second Legends game launching on Switch 2 so it can be more demanding or look better or larger. And then that followed by a main line pokemon game that actually spins the whole series on its head and takes a lot of risks

With the controlling your pokemon mechanic added in SV I'm a little worried they might do the Final Fantasy and make it so the future of pokemon is controlling them and fighting in real time. Which would be super cool but I don't know if game freak can pull it off
>Probably not though!

This really kills me, lol. Love Pokemon, but the last one that was really great IMO was probably B/W2. They really need to... evolve.... (👉⁰▽⁰)👉. Or just start other teams so they can each have longer dev cycles on remakes + mainlines-- the frequency of their releases may just be too high if they want to put out something of quality.
    They do actually. 2 teams. One handles core series games and the other remakes, DLC, 3rd games etc. Thing is that they just release games back to back and trade.
Classic two steps forward, one step back.
Disagree, SV took all the best bits already. I don’t want to. Catch 20 of the same pokemon to fill the pokedex and the battle mechanics were too shallow
    then why is sv garbage and pla isnt?
        SV is the best polemon game since bw2, the story is great, the battle mechanics are deep and interesting, all the QOL for competitive is awesome. Just looks like ass
EXACTLY MY DMBASS THOUGHT SNV WOJLD BE LIK ARCEUS 😭
Such as making the games look like they didn't come out 20 years ago.

Seriously by 2004 we had Final Fantasy XII, Halo 2, Half-Life 2, Metroid Prime, etc. which both look and ran better than Pokemon.
Definitelly. Gamefreak is a indie company yet, I hope they learn something or take some inspiration from Pocket Pair on their next releases. /s/s/s
This was me with Violet version as well. Two Pokémon games that you could just *see* the potential of came out within the same year and I enjoyed them greatly yet felt they were just "almost there" in a few things that would have made them both masterpieces.
    Yea I agree. I understand why many rag on modern pokemon and how gamefreak isn't some small indie company, but these 2 games clearly demonstrate how they're finally starting to bring the series in a new direction and not enough people are giving credit where it's due. They're obviously behind the curve when they shouldn't be, but that doesn't mean you can't enjoy the games for what they are considering at least part of their true vision shines through. The intent shines enough to the point where the games are still fun despite their shortcomings.

I wouldn't mind them pivoting to an HD2D style though if it means it doesn't have spaghetti code
        They don't give credit because it's obvious that they could do much more but aren't because they don't really need to.
            100% true. Sad to see everyone so eager to defend gamefreak for such mid games
            >it's obvious that they could do much more but aren't because they don't really need to

I personally don't understand so many people jumping to this conclusion. This implies that they did the bare minimum, but making a full on open world is obviously more than that. Its stability didn't turn out the best, but lets not ignore the fact that they just could've copy pasted the same linear formula as they always have. This is my main problem with this line of criticism that nobody has a proper logical justification for. They ignore the game's actual design and chalk up poor stability to laziness when they are not directly correlated.

Lets also not forget that pokemon is a franchise where everything is lined up around the games, so even if gamefreak wanted to delay them so they have more time, they literally cannot. That combined with the fact that they were primarily handheld developers jumping to console resulted to what we have now. This isn't a full excuse, but it's important to factor in the circumstances.
Most fun I had since Ruby
Same. Imagine how even better it would be if it wasn't a "side game" and had more effort put into it.
Agreed! I feel like all the dialogue for this game is three times longer than it needs to be. Everyone just won’t stop talking. I had fun but my god does it waste time.
    YES
Yeah especially at the beginning. Once you get past that it is the most fun I’ve had with a Pokémon game since gen 3.
    Wait, is there less dialogue later in the game? I hate the amount of dialogue so far. I stopped playing 🙁
That tutorial is the stuff of nightmares, but the actual battles and catch system is buttery smooth, it does cut a lot of the bs out
I couldn't get past the tutorial with how slow it is. Give me movement abilities right away!
Well when you're used to mainline pokémon games, this one looks lightning fast, even though it still has time wasters.
Came here to make this comment hahaha. It’s like an hour tutorial. 

But he is right that it is an amazing pokemon game. It is miles and miles better than scarlet/violet
I've played a lot of early access games that looked 10x better than arceus. It's cool to see gamefreak doing something substantially different, but goddamn did this game feel half-assed to me. I'd love to see the Pokemon company put a little bit more of their boundless wealth into developing a game at some point, and maybe allow for more than 1 year of development time. I think I'm out on the series unless I see some more substantial change.
    Why change the formula if everyone is already buying the game? The Pokemon playerbase says they won't buy the next game but preorder every time, then on launch make posts about how Game Freak cheated them out of their money.
        Yep lol. I hadn't bought a game prior to arceus since platinum, but they have such a massive fanbase that will buy anything with the pokemon name on it that there's no pressure for them to improve their product. I get why they pump out the low effort garbage they do, from a business perspective, I just wish they'd do better for my own nostalgic reasons. But I guess I'll have to look elsewhere to scratch that monster collector itch.
I think what makes it feel that way to me is the jarring inconsistency throughout its runtime. Whilst it looks a bit rough throughout, graphically, areas three and four are hideous due to rushed and mismatched terrain assets. Mechanically, field pokémon stop getting meaningful individualised catch mechanics after the first area! Look at the likes of Abra and Mr Mime. These are unique and force strategic gameplay. You don't see this level of species specific field behaviour again until the postgame legends.


Arceus was an excellent proof of concept but you can't help but wonder what it could have been with another six months development to not even fix the graphical performance but just fill out the content holes.
I know pokemon usually appeals to new players a lot more than regulars but legends was one of the few games I could genuinely recommend just on how fresh and fun it was.
Which is what, 0.5% of the game?
    Okay I’ll talk about the other 95.5%:

The Pokemon move pool is severely reduced 

No Pokemon abilities or held items 

Pokédex completion is extremely repetitive 

Zones are bland and empty, and the one town hub is lifeless 

The most exciting part of the game is the time distortion events that involve a lot of WAITING around because there’s no manual way to trigger them
        Agree with this. My least favourite Pokemon game on Switch.
        It's a side series that's slimmed down and more focused on action. If you want the slower, tactical version you still have the main series.
            Poster: The action is repetitive and becomes uninteresting

Response: That's only a small part of the game

Poster: The rest of the game is pretty minimal and bland

Response: Well the game is focused on action

Legends Arceus was fine, but the Pokemon community is so desperate for anything interesting that they give this game way too much credit. It feels like a tech demo for what could be a great game, which unfortunately is what most GameFreak games feel like.
                Agreed. This game is basic as it gets but it just so happens the other Pokémon games are so bad that this looks like a masterpiece in comparison.
You're getting downvoted but I mean you are correct.
[deleted]
    Yeah its better! Turn based is boring af!
If you like Arceus and have a device to play Palworld on, I think it’s worth a try. I’m a few hours in and it’s fun so far with some Arceus-like vibes.
    I believe Palworld is what Arceus should have been. Palworld is the most fun I've had a game in a long time. Daydreaming at work about it, looking up videos, reading guides. Ah
        Would love another Legends game to borrow ideas from Palworld.
[removed]
Interesting proof-of-concept of mechanics that *could* be used for a more complete pokemon game, but overall is just incomplete. Feels like the best pokemon game in years since it is actually expanding on what a pokemon game could look like, but is still incomplete in almost every other aspect.
What is your top 5 if i may ask
    It's a pretty vanilla list for me:

Super Smash Bros. Ultimate

Splatoon 2 (for now, 3 may be here instead after the Side Order DLC)

Mario Odyssey

Zelda BOTW

Pokemon Arceus
I didn't explain it properly, but I mean in comparison with the older tittles.
I'm thinking about getting it because of this thread even thought I know about the criticism. I didn't know about a 4 hour tutorial, is that true?
    By memory, it was a long tutorial. I would say 2/3 hours.
I agree about the dialogues. And about Palworld, I've only heard good things about it. I'll definitely give it a try soon.
It’s not though is it? Played it. It’s quite buggy and cheap and too much building and no battling. The art style clashes too. Nothing like pokemon
    It is in a sense that exploration is the main thing to do, and that catching 10 of the same Pals gives a huge XP gain. Art is subjective but for what Palworld is presenting seems to mesh well imo. I am playing the steam version with 2 other friends and ive generally have 60fps aside from being at base with multiple Pals doing tasks
    L m a o

That's gotta be a troll, you cannot have said that seriously
        No troll. My experience
            The thing is, except for ''too much building not enough battling'' the rest 1000% applies to pokemon
I agree with you about  the Voice acting, I forgot n to write this in the review, but a think it's about time for them to make it happen.
Violet/Scarlet are not really strong games at all imo.
Honestly neither are worth 60 bucks imo you are better off getting something else
    Think I’m going to finally dive into the Xenoblade Chronicles games
        Honestly good choice, I played all 3 and if you like rpgs with an amazing story and fun exploration, they are very worth it.
Rented from the library!?! What year is this!?!
    really man, my library has literally every game for all systems really. Way better than purchasing and having to sell it after. Just whipped through Luigi Mansion 3 in January. Perfect for me since typically when I finish a game I hardly ever play it back.
Maybe I didn't explain it right, but I mean in comparison to the old Pokémon games.
Exactly! ..and unfortunately, you and I will be both downvoted for stating the truth about the fact that this franchise is nowhere close to being where it should be after nearly 3 decades of continuous support from its fanbase.. you would think people would want to acknowledge this so that we can start getting a GREAT pokemon game, versus the continued mediocrity as of late.
    Yep. That’s the Reddit echo chamber for ya

I really hope the next gen gets it right and does it justice. With the amount of money they’re making their games should at the very least be super polished, even with the switch limitations.
I haven't played it, but I believe Sword and Shield follow the old  formula, with the only difference being the addition of open areas with Pokémon (no random encounters). However, I don't think it provides the  same level of freedom as Legends Arceus does.
Because they didn’t develop any meaningful ranked or online mode for it. People still say it’s a « mainline » game, it didn’t get any treatment of a mainline series. GF can say it is a main line series game but they didn’t treat it as such.
    Rather than try to defer it as a side game, I'd say it expands what it means to be a mainline pokemon game.

Besides, it added new pokemon and has full connectivity with Home and the other mainline games.
        I don’t understand why some people take it as an insult or personal when I say a game is not a mainline title. My top 3 Pokemon games are not mainline titles: 

1 Colosseum/XD

3 PLA

4 Diamond/Pearl


The first real mainline title on my list is sitting at N4. 

I WISH TPC would actually care to expand the Pokemon videogame universe. I absolutely lived the idea of Colosseum and XD. And if you like Pokemon soundtracks, those games had the absolute best bangers. Your main character, while a bit edgy, fit the game universe and IRL era (punk/rock style) PERFECTLY! The tone was more serious without being unadapted for children. I was around 10-11 when they came out. 

There was stuff I didn’t like, like the total absence of wild pokemon and the VERY LIMITED amount of them in XD later on. And that’s exactly why I would love more of this in the future. Expand on the theme and universe. 

Same for PLA. It is the closest I’ve had to fun with a Pokemon title since the Colosseum/XD days. It was unfortunately ruined by overwhelmingly bad performance, really outdated visuals ( which are as jarring as they are because of the lack of a fitting artstyle and art direction). I can still play Windwaker and say I still like the visual style today. Nothing like that could be said about PLA.  Performance wise it shouldn’ t be allowed on the Switch. It performs worse than a game in it’s early access/alpha/beta stage. But the gameplay loop and idea was fun. Gamefreak can do cool things when they dare to get out of their comfort zone and try to explore something new. The mainline gimmicks like Mega evo, Z moves or Gmax/tera are not daring something new. But the actual dangers of being around wild pokemon, and include it into gameplay is cool and new. We finally get what professor oak’s meant to tell us back in the days if red and blue! 

I think the reason why I’ve been enjoying mainline games less and less since Pearl/Dismond is just that those games (one can argue it’s white/black) reached the peak of what the pokemon formula can do back in the DS days. Scarlet/Violet tried changing a few things while staying safe after seeing the success of Arceus. Sword Shield did not do that and you won’t convince me otherwise. It’s corridors separated by the occasional big safari zone. That’s nothing daring. 

Sorry, I went and wrote a bible about this…
            for what it's worth, i wasn't taking it personally or as an insult, since i am not Pokemon Legends Arceus. and I agree that the soundtracks for the gamecube games were fantastic, i wish they'd hire the composer again
                I feel like almost any pokemon content creator will use those soundtracks as background music in their videos.
            > Diamond/Pearl

What? Those are Gen 4 and are clearly Mainline Games.
                I meant to say top 3. Apologies.
Edit: in my defense, I ranked Colosseum/XD at 1, PLA at 3 and DP at 4. 
Edited the first post for what it’s worth.
            it absolutely is not a mainline title, no matter what people say.

its the closest a spinoff has been so far, but its a different, simplified battle system and thats really all that matters.
    BDSP and Let’s Go didn’t have meaningful online either and those are mainline. 
        Those are remakes of mainline games. While those were treated like the mainline games in the 3DS days, that has no longer been the case on the switch. 

Let’s go is not a mainline series, it was a casual level entry game to hook some Go players to the main franchise (nothing negative, let’s go is probably one of my favourite pokemon titles on the  switch after PLA)

BDSP was… something I guess?
            nope, definitely still considered mainline

edit: double checked, and yup, bulbapedia even agrees listing them with core series titles for entries rather than side series
                Ok
                    I understand your point and I am right there with you. People can call them mainline all they want but tbh they really weren't treated that way.
                        Except everybody asked when Let’s Go was released if it was mainline, they said yes and also the national Pokédex will not come back, yet nobody cared. One year later everyone was surprised the national Pokédex wasn’t there in Sword & Shield.
                            You’re just repeating what I already know and what others have said. I am not saying no one said it’s a mainline game. I am just saying I understand the point that person is trying to make. The national dex issue is not one I care about though tbh, it never bothered me.
Puzzling? Pokemon is a yearly cash cow, why support a game that sold well, when they can crank out the next one? Maybe Palworld has me a little salty lol
    Isn’t palworld like two weeks old..?
        Yeah, and already has more support than the newest pokemon in terms of optimization and free content updates. The fact that GF has been milking a game that literally has sections that run at less than 10fps, and looks like a child programmed it in Alice isn't great, compared to a game with less than a 7mil budget and a team of 40 devs
Oh shit I think I missed that. Might need to revisit, was thinking about another play through anyway. Is that side game any good?
    It's basically an infinite gauntlet where you earn points based on Pokemon fights. You are given a list of potential pokemon teams to fight and how many points each team is worth. The harder the team, the more points you earn.  You can then spend those points on buffs and healing in between fights. You will eventually lose as the price of things get higher every time you buy them meaning you will eventually be left with no way to heal your pokemon or recharge their PP for moves. (creates a good space to experiment with crappy moves who's only redeeming quality is very high PP)

You get items based on how far you get.

It's interesting enough, nothing amazing. The biggest issue is that the rewards are good, but not great. You don't earn anything that makes the mode a "must do" which may be for the best if you're not good at it. 

The massive mass outbreaks have some of the best shiny odds in the whole series. (though shiny sandwich hunting during outbreaks in S/V may be equivalent, I don't know the numbers)
        [Massive mass outbreaks are worse than regular mass outbreaks in Arceus](https://twitter.com/Sibuna_Switch/status/1498056331315625984), but they are [better than any method in SV](https://twitter.com/Sibuna_Switch/status/1602047739751432192) outside of events.
            On the whole, it's inferior to hunting in SV because in SV the spawns come and go infinitely, whereas in PLA they are very limited in number until the outbreak ends. But still cool though
    Definitely! It’s the best postgame battle mode since Battle Tree in Sun/Moon. Kinda reminds me of the Battle Castle in Platinum’s BF
Why is that still the excuse? Game Freak has to be making more money than any other game developer, and they're backed by the most prolific advertising/Licensing company on the planet.
    They're basically scheduled to pump out a new game every year, and the studio doesn't have the support to maximize their quality with this kind of timeframe. The games have been dropping in quality for years.
        It’s not that the studio doesn’t have the support, it’s the studio doesn’t want to do anything about it.
    Its helpful once you acknowledge that the games are just ads for the merch at this point, not unlike saturday morning cartoons of your childhood.
        Right. I've known that for awhile. I'm just tired of hearing "games bad because game freak smol"
            Alas its "games bad because theres no incentive to be good"
    It's not an excuse. Nintendo and TPCI keep them small purposefully so they can have a regular release schedule. They don't care about growing the games. They only care about growing the franchise. They only need new characters every couple of years so they can sell plushies, trading cards, and TV shows. To them the games are simply an entry point for people to spend more money. Hopefully one day they learn the hard way.
        >Nintendo and TPCI keep them small purposefully so they can have a regular release schedule

No, Game Freak stays small because their higher ups prefer small teams. They're bad managers who don't want the responsibility of managing enough people to make a good game, and they have no reason to change because no matter what they squeeze out, everyone will buy it.
        Everyone's got opinions on why Pokémon games have been getting worse and worse, I know I have my own.  

But you'd think Nintendo would push back for higher quality, despite how well the games continue to sell.  Nintendo is known to be very protective of their IPs.  They know the reputational damage that can come from releasing an unfinished game to meet a deadline, and that a good game is appreciated even if released later than expected.  

I know Nintendo isn't solely in charge of Pokemon, but you'd think they'd have some sway at TPCI to say "Look, these games are not Nintendo quality, we need to do better."

I really wonder what is *really* causing the quality of the latest Pokémon games to be declining so much.  I thought they were really on the right track after Legends: Arceus, but the we got Scarlet/Violet that felt like they took two steps back from what they did with Legends: Arceus.
            I had a lot of fun with Legends Arceus, but there was still plenty wrong with it. Thankfully performance was much better than SV, but it still looked like a PS2 game. The open world was barren (just like SV). The only reason I enjoyed it over SV was the catching mechanic was a ton of fun. But outside of that, it didnt have a ton to offer. If this were an indie developed title, I’d say it was a great first game. But from the biggest franchise in the world? Fuck no.

And in terms of Nintendo having sway in this whole situation? Fact is we have no idea what goes on behind closed doors. Just because Nintendo is protective of most of their IPs doesn’t mean they can’t have exceptions. Pokemon is certainly an outlier with how much of a money making machine the merchandise is. And the quality of the games hasn’t put a dent in the sales. Nintendo cares about their IPs because it makes them money. If Pokemon still sells despite the quality, why should they care? And if thats not the case, that they really do care, then there aint shit they can do about it. They’re a minority stake of the brand, and they have the luxury of having the game as a console exclusive, and wouldnt want to rock the boat there. Whatever the case, its evident that nothing will change. Money talks. At best we might get a game that runs at a consistent frame rate again. Outside of that, don’t expect much.
    Nintendo does jack shit with the mainline series and it's unfortunate. Imagine a pokemon game with the same quality of Zelda or Mario games.
        Nintendo doesn't develop the games.
            I'm referring to them as developers who also own part of the IP.
                Nintendo aren't developers of the Pokemon games. Saying "Nintendo does jack shit" and comparing them to zelda or mario projects is irrelevant. Mario and zelda projects have multi year development time, and their release isn't timed to coincide with anime and merchandise. The pokemon release schedule is handled by the pokemon company, which operates independently of nintendo other than the fact that nintendo owns a share of that company. The games are developed by game freak, once again an independent game studio that nintendo owns a part of but does not control in any way. It would be more accurate to point the blame at the pokemon company, who are focused on pumping out annual pokemon titles and game freak who do not have enough experience on next gen systems to bring the quality up to a better standard.

Think I’m going to finally dive into the Xenoblade Chronicles games
    Honestly good choice, I played all 3 and if you like rpgs with an amazing story and fun exploration, they are very worth it.
really man, my library has literally every game for all systems really. Way better than purchasing and having to sell it after. Just whipped through Luigi Mansion 3 in January. Perfect for me since typically when I finish a game I hardly ever play it back.
Yep. That’s the Reddit echo chamber for ya

I really hope the next gen gets it right and does it justice. With the amount of money they’re making their games should at the very least be super polished, even with the switch limitations.
Rather than try to defer it as a side game, I'd say it expands what it means to be a mainline pokemon game.

Besides, it added new pokemon and has full connectivity with Home and the other mainline games.
    I don’t understand why some people take it as an insult or personal when I say a game is not a mainline title. My top 3 Pokemon games are not mainline titles: 

1 Colosseum/XD

3 PLA

4 Diamond/Pearl


The first real mainline title on my list is sitting at N4. 

I WISH TPC would actually care to expand the Pokemon videogame universe. I absolutely lived the idea of Colosseum and XD. And if you like Pokemon soundtracks, those games had the absolute best bangers. Your main character, while a bit edgy, fit the game universe and IRL era (punk/rock style) PERFECTLY! The tone was more serious without being unadapted for children. I was around 10-11 when they came out. 

There was stuff I didn’t like, like the total absence of wild pokemon and the VERY LIMITED amount of them in XD later on. And that’s exactly why I would love more of this in the future. Expand on the theme and universe. 

Same for PLA. It is the closest I’ve had to fun with a Pokemon title since the Colosseum/XD days. It was unfortunately ruined by overwhelmingly bad performance, really outdated visuals ( which are as jarring as they are because of the lack of a fitting artstyle and art direction). I can still play Windwaker and say I still like the visual style today. Nothing like that could be said about PLA.  Performance wise it shouldn’ t be allowed on the Switch. It performs worse than a game in it’s early access/alpha/beta stage. But the gameplay loop and idea was fun. Gamefreak can do cool things when they dare to get out of their comfort zone and try to explore something new. The mainline gimmicks like Mega evo, Z moves or Gmax/tera are not daring something new. But the actual dangers of being around wild pokemon, and include it into gameplay is cool and new. We finally get what professor oak’s meant to tell us back in the days if red and blue! 

I think the reason why I’ve been enjoying mainline games less and less since Pearl/Dismond is just that those games (one can argue it’s white/black) reached the peak of what the pokemon formula can do back in the DS days. Scarlet/Violet tried changing a few things while staying safe after seeing the success of Arceus. Sword Shield did not do that and you won’t convince me otherwise. It’s corridors separated by the occasional big safari zone. That’s nothing daring. 

Sorry, I went and wrote a bible about this…
        for what it's worth, i wasn't taking it personally or as an insult, since i am not Pokemon Legends Arceus. and I agree that the soundtracks for the gamecube games were fantastic, i wish they'd hire the composer again
            I feel like almost any pokemon content creator will use those soundtracks as background music in their videos.
        > Diamond/Pearl

What? Those are Gen 4 and are clearly Mainline Games.
            I meant to say top 3. Apologies.
Edit: in my defense, I ranked Colosseum/XD at 1, PLA at 3 and DP at 4. 
Edited the first post for what it’s worth.
        it absolutely is not a mainline title, no matter what people say.

its the closest a spinoff has been so far, but its a different, simplified battle system and thats really all that matters.
BDSP and Let’s Go didn’t have meaningful online either and those are mainline. 
    Those are remakes of mainline games. While those were treated like the mainline games in the 3DS days, that has no longer been the case on the switch. 

Let’s go is not a mainline series, it was a casual level entry game to hook some Go players to the main franchise (nothing negative, let’s go is probably one of my favourite pokemon titles on the  switch after PLA)

BDSP was… something I guess?
        nope, definitely still considered mainline

edit: double checked, and yup, bulbapedia even agrees listing them with core series titles for entries rather than side series
            Ok
                I understand your point and I am right there with you. People can call them mainline all they want but tbh they really weren't treated that way.
                    Except everybody asked when Let’s Go was released if it was mainline, they said yes and also the national Pokédex will not come back, yet nobody cared. One year later everyone was surprised the national Pokédex wasn’t there in Sword & Shield.
                        You’re just repeating what I already know and what others have said. I am not saying no one said it’s a mainline game. I am just saying I understand the point that person is trying to make. The national dex issue is not one I care about though tbh, it never bothered me.
Isn’t palworld like two weeks old..?
    Yeah, and already has more support than the newest pokemon in terms of optimization and free content updates. The fact that GF has been milking a game that literally has sections that run at less than 10fps, and looks like a child programmed it in Alice isn't great, compared to a game with less than a 7mil budget and a team of 40 devs
It's basically an infinite gauntlet where you earn points based on Pokemon fights. You are given a list of potential pokemon teams to fight and how many points each team is worth. The harder the team, the more points you earn.  You can then spend those points on buffs and healing in between fights. You will eventually lose as the price of things get higher every time you buy them meaning you will eventually be left with no way to heal your pokemon or recharge their PP for moves. (creates a good space to experiment with crappy moves who's only redeeming quality is very high PP)

You get items based on how far you get.

It's interesting enough, nothing amazing. The biggest issue is that the rewards are good, but not great. You don't earn anything that makes the mode a "must do" which may be for the best if you're not good at it. 

The massive mass outbreaks have some of the best shiny odds in the whole series. (though shiny sandwich hunting during outbreaks in S/V may be equivalent, I don't know the numbers)
    [Massive mass outbreaks are worse than regular mass outbreaks in Arceus](https://twitter.com/Sibuna_Switch/status/1498056331315625984), but they are [better than any method in SV](https://twitter.com/Sibuna_Switch/status/1602047739751432192) outside of events.
        On the whole, it's inferior to hunting in SV because in SV the spawns come and go infinitely, whereas in PLA they are very limited in number until the outbreak ends. But still cool though
Definitely! It’s the best postgame battle mode since Battle Tree in Sun/Moon. Kinda reminds me of the Battle Castle in Platinum’s BF
They're basically scheduled to pump out a new game every year, and the studio doesn't have the support to maximize their quality with this kind of timeframe. The games have been dropping in quality for years.
    It’s not that the studio doesn’t have the support, it’s the studio doesn’t want to do anything about it.
Its helpful once you acknowledge that the games are just ads for the merch at this point, not unlike saturday morning cartoons of your childhood.
    Right. I've known that for awhile. I'm just tired of hearing "games bad because game freak smol"
        Alas its "games bad because theres no incentive to be good"
It's not an excuse. Nintendo and TPCI keep them small purposefully so they can have a regular release schedule. They don't care about growing the games. They only care about growing the franchise. They only need new characters every couple of years so they can sell plushies, trading cards, and TV shows. To them the games are simply an entry point for people to spend more money. Hopefully one day they learn the hard way.
    >Nintendo and TPCI keep them small purposefully so they can have a regular release schedule

No, Game Freak stays small because their higher ups prefer small teams. They're bad managers who don't want the responsibility of managing enough people to make a good game, and they have no reason to change because no matter what they squeeze out, everyone will buy it.
    Everyone's got opinions on why Pokémon games have been getting worse and worse, I know I have my own.  

But you'd think Nintendo would push back for higher quality, despite how well the games continue to sell.  Nintendo is known to be very protective of their IPs.  They know the reputational damage that can come from releasing an unfinished game to meet a deadline, and that a good game is appreciated even if released later than expected.  

I know Nintendo isn't solely in charge of Pokemon, but you'd think they'd have some sway at TPCI to say "Look, these games are not Nintendo quality, we need to do better."

I really wonder what is *really* causing the quality of the latest Pokémon games to be declining so much.  I thought they were really on the right track after Legends: Arceus, but the we got Scarlet/Violet that felt like they took two steps back from what they did with Legends: Arceus.
        I had a lot of fun with Legends Arceus, but there was still plenty wrong with it. Thankfully performance was much better than SV, but it still looked like a PS2 game. The open world was barren (just like SV). The only reason I enjoyed it over SV was the catching mechanic was a ton of fun. But outside of that, it didnt have a ton to offer. If this were an indie developed title, I’d say it was a great first game. But from the biggest franchise in the world? Fuck no.

And in terms of Nintendo having sway in this whole situation? Fact is we have no idea what goes on behind closed doors. Just because Nintendo is protective of most of their IPs doesn’t mean they can’t have exceptions. Pokemon is certainly an outlier with how much of a money making machine the merchandise is. And the quality of the games hasn’t put a dent in the sales. Nintendo cares about their IPs because it makes them money. If Pokemon still sells despite the quality, why should they care? And if thats not the case, that they really do care, then there aint shit they can do about it. They’re a minority stake of the brand, and they have the luxury of having the game as a console exclusive, and wouldnt want to rock the boat there. Whatever the case, its evident that nothing will change. Money talks. At best we might get a game that runs at a consistent frame rate again. Outside of that, don’t expect much.
Nintendo does jack shit with the mainline series and it's unfortunate. Imagine a pokemon game with the same quality of Zelda or Mario games.
    Nintendo doesn't develop the games.
        I'm referring to them as developers who also own part of the IP.
            Nintendo aren't developers of the Pokemon games. Saying "Nintendo does jack shit" and comparing them to zelda or mario projects is irrelevant. Mario and zelda projects have multi year development time, and their release isn't timed to coincide with anime and merchandise. The pokemon release schedule is handled by the pokemon company, which operates independently of nintendo other than the fact that nintendo owns a share of that company. The games are developed by game freak, once again an independent game studio that nintendo owns a part of but does not control in any way. It would be more accurate to point the blame at the pokemon company, who are focused on pumping out annual pokemon titles and game freak who do not have enough experience on next gen systems to bring the quality up to a better standard.
Possibly. But the next generation have probably been in development since before SV were released.
SV is the best polemon game since bw2, the story is great, the battle mechanics are deep and interesting, all the QOL for competitive is awesome. Just looks like ass
They don't give credit because it's obvious that they could do much more but aren't because they don't really need to.
    100% true. Sad to see everyone so eager to defend gamefreak for such mid games
    >it's obvious that they could do much more but aren't because they don't really need to

I personally don't understand so many people jumping to this conclusion. This implies that they did the bare minimum, but making a full on open world is obviously more than that. Its stability didn't turn out the best, but lets not ignore the fact that they just could've copy pasted the same linear formula as they always have. This is my main problem with this line of criticism that nobody has a proper logical justification for. They ignore the game's actual design and chalk up poor stability to laziness when they are not directly correlated.

Lets also not forget that pokemon is a franchise where everything is lined up around the games, so even if gamefreak wanted to delay them so they have more time, they literally cannot. That combined with the fact that they were primarily handheld developers jumping to console resulted to what we have now. This isn't a full excuse, but it's important to factor in the circumstances.
Yep lol. I hadn't bought a game prior to arceus since platinum, but they have such a massive fanbase that will buy anything with the pokemon name on it that there's no pressure for them to improve their product. I get why they pump out the low effort garbage they do, from a business perspective, I just wish they'd do better for my own nostalgic reasons. But I guess I'll have to look elsewhere to scratch that monster collector itch.
Agree with this. My least favourite Pokemon game on Switch.
It's a side series that's slimmed down and more focused on action. If you want the slower, tactical version you still have the main series.
    Poster: The action is repetitive and becomes uninteresting

Response: That's only a small part of the game

Poster: The rest of the game is pretty minimal and bland

Response: Well the game is focused on action

Legends Arceus was fine, but the Pokemon community is so desperate for anything interesting that they give this game way too much credit. It feels like a tech demo for what could be a great game, which unfortunately is what most GameFreak games feel like.
        Agreed. This game is basic as it gets but it just so happens the other Pokémon games are so bad that this looks like a masterpiece in comparison.
Would love another Legends game to borrow ideas from Palworld.
