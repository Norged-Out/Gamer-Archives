[[Night's Edge is really fun to use now]]





Same, the new swords are really fun
the excalibur is an actually good weapon now
    Yeah, I really feel like there is a proper progression for melee now. Before I basically ignored any melee weapon without autoswing and a projectile. I do think it would be fun to have some right click melee abilities though.
        Hey I'm just trying out melee for the first time (I have 600+ hours so not a newbie, just never really saw the appeal of it). Could you tell me whats a good progression for melee? I kind of know what to do for yoyos but idk for swords and whatnot
            First do starfury or enchanted sword, then go after blade of grass, eventually you’ll craft the nights edge which will get you through the rest of pre-hardmode, once you’re in hardmode there’s… not much for options so try to go for a yo-yo, that’s what I usually do, but once you kill your first mech you can make the Excalibur which is also good now and maybe that can get you through the rest of the mechs (though I doubt you’ll get through the twins with it so if you can, stick with the yo-yo until after the 3 mechs), once you beat the mechs make the True Night’s Edge and use that for Plantera, after Plantera get a broken hero sword to get the True Excalibur and make yourself the Terra Blade (which you’ll be using for Gollem and the cultist), after you beat Gollem I suggest grinding him for the possessed hatchet too as it’s a great weapon for the cultist, after the cultist you as usual do the pillars and get the 2 solar weapons which will help out a ton against Moon Lord, post ML get the Zenith

Hope this helps
                Thanks a bunch! Will give this route a go!
                    An alternative for the yoyo section after hardmode starts is to farm underground snow for an ice sickle, it works wonders
                    And remember, for the rough patch where you use yo-yos, the skeleton merchant sells yo-yo accessories that can be quite helpful

                    Yoyo is bad. Early game I recommend ranger because there aren't a lot of strong melee weapons in early pre hardmode. Next craft the blade of grass. Then try to get the 4 swords to make nights edge. use nights edge to kill WOF and maybe even a mech boss then upgrade to excalibur. But I just got to plantera and this is my first playthrough on classic mode since I only beat it on journey. But after the mechs it's all you. Also forgot to mention death and ice sickle
                FYI true excalibur just requires chlorophyte bars now, so you can use either true nights edge or true excaliber for plantera.
            I was gonna say “How can you have 600+ hours and not play Melee once” then I remembered I’ve never even thought about being Summoner so yeah.
    At the cost of its projectile
        Pretty great tradeoff tho.
            Melee players when the melee weapon summons ranged magical projectiles
            i'd say it's an upgrade
            i disagree, true melee weapons are a pain in the ass to use against bosses
                Flails
                But they are great against crowds of enemies, being able to hit many enemies in one swing. This makes them balanced. Also they're still decent against some bosses, their high dps allows you to deal damage in quick bursts.
                    yeah, but i don't really like using weapons that are risky to use against bosses
                        So play mage, lol

        For bigass range? I'll take it
        excalibur never had one
            True Excalibur did, not sure about the normal Excalibur.
        The projectile part was only in true excalibur if I remember correctly.
            true also got the rework, loosening said projectile, I don’t remember is regular had it too… been awhile since I used the weapon
        Why have two weapons at the same progression act nearly mechanically identical?
        ITS CALLED MELEE CLASS NOT MELEE RANGED CLASS MORON
            Mo
        It was a boring weapon
Night's Edge went from being a terra blade material to strait up the best melee weapon on pre hardmode
    how god intended
    It’s basically a pre-hardmode Zenith now and I love it.
Of all the pre-hardmode weapons this is strongest right now.
    Which is kind of the point, and was always supposed to be
It's kinda like a mini-Zenith. Absolutely wild. I almost prefer it over the True Night's Edge.
Am I the only one that finds the enlarged swords to look… off compared to the others?
    I think some sprites look better and others I do agree look a little strange
    Yeah it looks like something from calamity
Terra blade is actually OP right now, they're probably going to nerf it. You can use it all the way up to Moon Lord if you'd want to
    The Terra blade was always able to be used until Moon Lord, so maybe it won’t get nerfed
        Crowd Control got a lot better, I did Frost and Pumpkin moons with it, also Martians. Effortless
            Well it should melt those events. Terra blade is basically *the* iconic Terraria weapon and it was buffed due to underperforming statistically (against invasions) and especially visually.
                Jesus. Dudes just trying to tell us how he is enjoying the game. Why do you feel the need to respond to him like you're a teacher or something?

Its just a game bro you don't have to constantly "be right"
                    Read the whole thread lol, the first person was saying that terra blade is OP and will be nerfed.
                        I did The Lunar Events today. Melted Cultist, destroyed Solar and Vortex Pillars first try, died twice at Stardust and thrice at Nebula. Then I tried it for a second on Moon Lord but the short projectile range really makes a difference, so I just used the Daybreak as I usually do on Warrior playthroughs. Even made a Zenith. Terra blade is finally the legendary, epic weapon it was supposed to be
                        Yeah making fun of noobs is so cool and inclusive.
                            ?
                            Are you sure you're looking at the same thread as the rest of us?
                                Perhaps they're in a different universe?
                            Jesse what the fuck are you talking about
    same for night's edge: i've been trying to replace it all pre-mech hardmode since it was a pre-hardmode weapon but i realized it was better than everything else and even than the buffed excalibur somehow
        Post mech I used Light Disc and True NE, killed Plantera with it. Didnt even make an arena, a bulb spawned next to a natural minecart track and I just went up and down, if it was close I used the Sword and if it was far I used the Discs. After you get the Terra Blade you're set for Golem, Cultists, and any events, it's great for crowd control now.
            Buffed discs are still weak in my opinion they are worse than bananas which you can get at the beginning of hardmode cause bananas travel and shoot faster so if the opponent is not moving in a straight line they land more hits and the dps is nearly the same, also sometimes you don't get all the discs back in time
                I used both in my current playthrough and discs are 100% better. Bananas are very good too but discs are better
                    I haven't fought plantera yet, i used light discs and bananas against skeletron prime and the twins with ichor and i was landing way more hits with bananas (legendary) so i used them and after i killed them both i sold both disks and bananas and crafted the two true weapons
        I don't agree. It's true that it's leagues better than before, but its short range makes safer melee weapons like amarok or chain guillotines still viable. I'm also curious if the buff to the breaker blade (even slower but the first hit deals super huge damage) made it good at its niche or not (wof didn't drop it for me and sadly I couldn't find any other voodoo dmeons)
        I killed the wall of flesh so fast with nights edge and I wasn’t even as related as I wanted to be I just thought why not buffed up and threw in the doll just to see how far I could make it before dying and instead I just face tanked while slicing it to pieces not even using half my hell bridge so it might be a *bit* strong
    Yep, they would probably. It's current or should I say it's supposed to be competitor, the Influx Waver can't even compete with it no more. The buff Terra Blade got was too good, nothing in it's stage can even compete it.
    It does less DPS than before
        But it alot easier to land the projectile now
            I like the change, but it isn't any more viable for bosses than the old one. Less damage and range. I like how the change makes the influx waver useful now.
        Against one to two targets, assuming you actually hit every shot with the narrow projectile. 

Also, I'm pretty sure the projectile fire rate benefits from melee speed now.
            I'm not against the change, I am just pointing out that it does less DPS against bosses/single foes and is definitely not overpowered
    I did, then beat it first try.
    But I thought it already got a nerf? (according to everyone else)
        Stat wise yes, but now it's bigger, fires a bigger, faster projectile, but shorter range. Also it fires it every swing so melee speed affects it. It pierces a lot too
I loved using this new version of the sword. It melted wall of flesh. So much fun. I am having so much fun with the melee update.
im glad i started my melee playthrough in the new update
Me vs the guy she tells me not to worry about
So is it just slightly bigger?
    It got reworked. Now instead of generic sword #124 it's actually very good for pre mech. It spins around you and also makes a smaller spin in the direction you aim. The only sword that really replaces it is its True version lol

    And slightly edgier
It's so satisfying to use now
Just got it. Can confirm.
I can finally move through the true surface of everything seed with it.
They resprited it? I didnt even notice until this meme.
Muramasa is fun as hell too. Mura+Speed boots+Shadow is the dumbest run and gun build in terraria and you can’t convince me otherwise
Legit, the new Night's Edge gave me a newfound love for my Night's Edge toy I got in 2015.
it only had to be raised a few pixels, perfect
    Try it, it's really good
I don't like the Terra blade change. The green sword projectiles were iconic, and now they are gone. I'm weeping in my bedroom right now, the loss is devastating.
    wouldn’t there still be terra blade projectiles with the Zenith?
    “So glad I grew up with this but damn this is better” Is what I’m feeling about the terrablade change.
volcano does more single target dps imo
make the night’s edgierererererererererest

i want a blade long enough to rival the Zenith’s range of influence
whats new about it
    Imagine the Zenith but it has smaller range and it’s just the Nights Edge.
I am fighting the destroyer with my legendary nights edge but I can't seem to defeat it should I reforge my excalibur and kill it with it or stay with my nights edge
    I used chain guillotines with other mechanical bosses but ofc won't work with destroyer
Should I use nights edge or xcalibur once I get through the mechs

This is my first playthrough since 2020 so idk which ones better now
Yeah, I really feel like there is a proper progression for melee now. Before I basically ignored any melee weapon without autoswing and a projectile. I do think it would be fun to have some right click melee abilities though.

I'm also curious if the buff to the breaker blade (even slower but the first hit deals super huge damage) made it good at its niche or not (wof didn't drop it for me and sadly I couldn't find any other voodoo dmeons)
I killed the wall of flesh so fast with nights edge and I wasn’t even as related as I wanted to be I just thought why not buffed up and threw in the doll just to see how far I could make it before dying and instead I just face tanked while slicing it to pieces not even using half my hell bridge so it might be a *bit* strong
But it alot easier to land the projectile now
    I like the change, but it isn't any more viable for bosses than the old one. Less damage and range. I like how the change makes the influx waver useful now.
Against one to two targets, assuming you actually hit every shot with the narrow projectile. 

Also, I'm pretty sure the projectile fire rate benefits from melee speed now.
    I'm not against the change, I am just pointing out that it does less DPS against bosses/single foes and is definitely not overpowered
Stat wise yes, but now it's bigger, fires a bigger, faster projectile, but shorter range. Also it fires it every swing so melee speed affects it. It pierces a lot too

First do starfury or enchanted sword, then go after blade of grass, eventually you’ll craft the nights edge which will get you through the rest of pre-hardmode, once you’re in hardmode there’s… not much for options so try to go for a yo-yo, that’s what I usually do, but once you kill your first mech you can make the Excalibur which is also good now and maybe that can get you through the rest of the mechs (though I doubt you’ll get through the twins with it so if you can, stick with the yo-yo until after the 3 mechs), once you beat the mechs make the True Night’s Edge and use that for Plantera, after Plantera get a broken hero sword to get the True Excalibur and make yourself the Terra Blade (which you’ll be using for Gollem and the cultist), after you beat Gollem I suggest grinding him for the possessed hatchet too as it’s a great weapon for the cultist, after the cultist you as usual do the pillars and get the 2 solar weapons which will help out a ton against Moon Lord, post ML get the Zenith

Hope this helps
    Thanks a bunch! Will give this route a go!
        An alternative for the yoyo section after hardmode starts is to farm underground snow for an ice sickle, it works wonders
        And remember, for the rough patch where you use yo-yos, the skeleton merchant sells yo-yo accessories that can be quite helpful

        Yoyo is bad. Early game I recommend ranger because there aren't a lot of strong melee weapons in early pre hardmode. Next craft the blade of grass. Then try to get the 4 swords to make nights edge. use nights edge to kill WOF and maybe even a mech boss then upgrade to excalibur. But I just got to plantera and this is my first playthrough on classic mode since I only beat it on journey. But after the mechs it's all you. Also forgot to mention death and ice sickle
    FYI true excalibur just requires chlorophyte bars now, so you can use either true nights edge or true excaliber for plantera.
I was gonna say “How can you have 600+ hours and not play Melee once” then I remembered I’ve never even thought about being Summoner so yeah.
Melee players when the melee weapon summons ranged magical projectiles
i'd say it's an upgrade
i disagree, true melee weapons are a pain in the ass to use against bosses
    Flails
    But they are great against crowds of enemies, being able to hit many enemies in one swing. This makes them balanced. Also they're still decent against some bosses, their high dps allows you to deal damage in quick bursts.
        yeah, but i don't really like using weapons that are risky to use against bosses
            So play mage, lol

True Excalibur did, not sure about the normal Excalibur.
true also got the rework, loosening said projectile, I don’t remember is regular had it too… been awhile since I used the weapon

Well it should melt those events. Terra blade is basically *the* iconic Terraria weapon and it was buffed due to underperforming statistically (against invasions) and especially visually.
    Jesus. Dudes just trying to tell us how he is enjoying the game. Why do you feel the need to respond to him like you're a teacher or something?

Its just a game bro you don't have to constantly "be right"
        Read the whole thread lol, the first person was saying that terra blade is OP and will be nerfed.
            I did The Lunar Events today. Melted Cultist, destroyed Solar and Vortex Pillars first try, died twice at Stardust and thrice at Nebula. Then I tried it for a second on Moon Lord but the short projectile range really makes a difference, so I just used the Daybreak as I usually do on Warrior playthroughs. Even made a Zenith. Terra blade is finally the legendary, epic weapon it was supposed to be
            Yeah making fun of noobs is so cool and inclusive.

Buffed discs are still weak in my opinion they are worse than bananas which you can get at the beginning of hardmode cause bananas travel and shoot faster so if the opponent is not moving in a straight line they land more hits and the dps is nearly the same, also sometimes you don't get all the discs back in time
    I used both in my current playthrough and discs are 100% better. Bananas are very good too but discs are better
        I haven't fought plantera yet, i used light discs and bananas against skeletron prime and the twins with ichor and i was landing way more hits with bananas (legendary) so i used them and after i killed them both i sold both disks and bananas and crafted the two true weapons
