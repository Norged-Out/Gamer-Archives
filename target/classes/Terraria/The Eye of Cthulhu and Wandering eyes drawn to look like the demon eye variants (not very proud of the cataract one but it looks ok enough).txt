[[The Eye of Cthulhu and Wandering eyes drawn to look like the demon eye variants (not very proud of the cataract one but it looks ok enough)]]





I never realized that the sleepy ones had eyelids, I just assumed it was an eyeball with a chunk missing. This is really cool!
    I always assumed it had an extra chunk of flesh on it, like a tumor or something
    I thought it was a hat
        Yeah, me too
    wtf me too
    To me it looked like a smile, still see it knowing what it is
    Same here
I especially like the purple one. It would be interesting if there was a chance for the eye to spawn/be summoned with these variants.
    Yeah that's what I was thinking too

THATS DILATED??? I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS A PHYSICAL REPRESENTATION OF THE BLACK LENS LIKE WHEN THE ZOMBIES HAVE A LONG ARM
    Same actually
    The zombies don't have a long arm, they have somebody else's
        I think they take their own arm off and hold it. If you look closely you can see they only have one arm attached
This is awesome.
    Thanks!
The "sleepy" eye has a chunk cut out of it and I refuse to accept it as an eyelid. I've always saw that as a chunk cut out and it looks so wrong to see it as an eyelid.
    The wiki called it sleepy and I can kinda see it as well
        It's definitely meant to be an eyelid. It just bothers me because it seems so wrong for an eye that's not attached to a face to have an eyelid. I always saw it as a chunk cut out until I read the Wiki page.
            But we're all ok with the mouth no worries there
                I don't get it. Doesn't everyone's irises peel back to reveal teeth when you're angry?
pretty sweet. I kinda wish that was something that you could see in master mode :/
your pupil gets bigger when you look at something you love

eye of cthulhu looking at moon lord :
My first tought is that they could be bound to what colour of moon your world generates. 10/10
I’d like to see this in a mod where to progress from prehardmode to hard mode you would have to defeat all of the different variants at once
Man, I always thought that the sleepy one is actualy cut in half
"Wandering eye" "True eye of c'thulhu"
The eye behind the slaughter
So you like your eyes circumcised or not ?
    Definitely uncircumcised
i always saw the sleepy one as an eye with a chunk missing, but everyone is saying that so i think ill also say that i always thought the "dilated' one was just an eye with a black lens

also the purple eye of cthulhu looks dope as heck
Everyone sayin sleepy is cut but nobody mentions that its dilated??


I thought thats where the black lens came from
This must become a texture pack that randomized those textures
Sleepy, more like judgy.

"A wooden bow? Honestly? Oh honey you're going to have to do better than that" (in the voice of the Clear Eyes guy)
middle right is sam
    Yeah I can see it
        bell of nice
Texture pack when? (side note it would be cool if texture packs could support sprite variants where they didn't use to exist like this but that's a pretty niche feature)
    I would love to if I had any idea how to operate a xnb exporter
I just realized I forgot Servants of Cthulhu
This is cool! Reminds me of the fargo's soul mod, where the texture of 'EOC' is the 'True EOC'
*someone make a texture pack that makes eoc purple and spazmatizm and retinizer green and red
you should make a texture **pack for this**
    I unfortunately don't know how to use a XNB exporter
        oh rip
Looks like a circumcision gone wrong.
Honestly, devs should make eye of cthulu have randomized textures just like these and how the demon eyes work, would be a very nice and small touch imo.

And they dont even need to do much, the sprites are all right here assuming theyll give full credit using them
    The caratact and sleepy sprites should probably be remade tho, I'm far from a professional and they don't look the best IMO
        Sleepy looks perfect to me, its got that, crispy pixelation while also looking like a literal smooth texture, think about how ores were redone but everyone thought they look weird and worse at first
It isn't sleepy. It's uncircumsised
Oh my god sleepy is so unsettling
I really wish this type of thing was in the game.
Love it, great job!
I had this idea for a while, but you executed it the best way possible

I’m assuming the dialated and cataract ones don’t have a toothy form because it only changes the pupil?
    Yep
I thought dilated was a sunglasses contact
Shouldnt the eyelid be on top of the veins?
    The sleepy demon eye has a bit of red veins above the eyelid, so I did the same thing for the wandering eye and EoC
        Oh i see
They should change to different variants depending on the difficulty they are currently in. Like green could be expert mode, purple could be master mode and cataract or dilated could be journey mode

And then we have sleepy eye of cythulhu as a rare spawn just for laughs
Sleepy second phase is cursed af
I always thought the sleepy one had a cheesecutter hat on...
Wait wouldn’t the sleepy eye not have any veins going over the eyelid
Who wants the sleepy eye to be EoC 3rd phase, which has higher defence
stop, no more eye of Cthulhu eyelids.
I thought sleepy was an demon that had a chink missing or had been cut in half.
the cataract one looks like cum
Bruh I thought the sleeping ones where just wandering eyes with half off there body missing
I thought the sleepy one had a hat
Cthulhu be on that MDMA eye see
The purple one looks awesome, great art
There's one red pixel you missed in the upper right of each of the EoC color variants.
    thanks, i hate you
        It was there with or without me, but now there's a chance it can be fixed.

The 2nd phase sleepy eye of chththhulu looks kinda weird
I love the cataract one.
That's what the bottom left one Is? I always thought it was just fully red with a toothy grin!
Petition to add this in 1.4.1?

New version with Servants of Cthulhu because for some reason you can't edit image posts
Love the sleepy variant.
I know this is an old post but it's super cool anyway

Thanks!
The wiki called it sleepy and I can kinda see it as well
    It's definitely meant to be an eyelid. It just bothers me because it seems so wrong for an eye that's not attached to a face to have an eyelid. I always saw it as a chunk cut out until I read the Wiki page.
        But we're all ok with the mouth no worries there
            I don't get it. Doesn't everyone's irises peel back to reveal teeth when you're angry?
Definitely uncircumcised
