[[For the 8 people who play with the calamity mod]]

    well i thought you could edit titles so i was going to change the title to the number of upvotes, i recently found that you can't change the title
        [First time?](https://en.meming.world/images/en/5/5d/James_Franco_First_Time.jpg)
            I.... How dare you not Rick Roll me with this.
                I want to r/ this but I don't know a good one...
                    r/Rickrollarmy would work fine
        lmao
    Its a joke
        Wow who could’ve guessed
            I wasn’t talking to you
                Unless you dm someone, you're talking to everyone that can reply.
                    So if this was irl and I was in the middle of a group of people talking and was talking to a specific person everyone else would be involved? If I wanted to say something that was directed toward a larger scope I wouldn’t reply to a specific comment. That’s pretty flawed logic
                        I think comparing a reddit comment to an irl group is pretty flawed logic.
                            Ok? So because there is a different medium of communication the rules have changed? Is there any specific etiquette for how replies operate?
                                Actually yes. One of the main rules is that anyone can reply to you if they want to. Because of the nature of it being text on a screen, multiple people can talk and be understood at the same time. This is unlike irl conversations because you might need to wait for someone else to complete their thought. This is also a public subreddit, so the group of people analogy was pretty weak. It's more like yelling a question into a crowd of thousands of people and only expecting a single person to reply.
                                    [removed]
                                    This would be a valid argument if there wasn’t some generalized logic in there but its not directed at the public, if other people do chip in thats fine. Still doesn’t change the fact that by *replying to a specific person by replying to a comment. You can do the same thing, but it would change nothing by the fact that your opinion does not matter to me because I wasn’t replying to you. I was replying to the other guy. This shouldn’t be really that hard to grasp.
                                Then why did you have to call the other dude out for responding to you, that’s perfectly fine, unless we are all going by “the rules” or “etiquette for how replies operate”
                i wasnt talking to you either
                    ...no shit?
                        Unless you dm someone, you're talking to everyone that can reply.

        #*For the worthy flashbacks*
            ?
                Make your world an expert, hard world with the seed ‘For the Worthy’ and get hit by a slime once.
                    I know what for the worthy is, I was curious what you meant by "for the worthy flashbacks". I now see that for the win has the same first letters as for the worthy. I was saying the kahoot name I commonly use is better than the random name generator's.
    Yeah I want to be Cat Fucker 69 but noooooo
    Like a kid in my class said, all they do is put and adjective in front of an animal name
    HornyDinosaur69
    its on the same level as Rec Room names
    Damn those are like default xbox names
    I'm fine w dat
    But it's also calling him a cow .\_.
    IHateTheNameRandomizerAhh1234
What's the kahoot name randomizer? Haven't used kahoot since highschool and back then you just typed a name, real or funny meme if allowed.
    they introduced a random name generator that you could only spin 2 times where it just puts two 'safe' words from an extremely limited selection together, and after that you still need to ask students for names its clunky and takes along time to
        if you could choose from a list of words it would at least be bearable, but nooo they just HAVE to make it random, with ONLY 2 RESPINS

(i mean you can just put in the code again but still)
            As a teacher who uses the name randomized - I’m sorry! But there’s only so many times I can see Ben Dover, Mike Hunt, and Sascha Grey or w/e, even though secretly it makes me laugh.
                My personal favorite that I've had to ban from my room is "The School Kahooter." Actually kinda clever but if admin ever sees it, I'm in a lot of trouble.
                Can you explain the last name? I know the others, but I've never that one before.
                    Sascha Grey was a famous porn star, there are other ones today students like using but I couldn’t remember their names.
                        Ah, I see. All I got was Sasha Grey when I looked her up. Thank you!
                That’s insane. Nobody in our class has the balls for that.
                    I mean it’s anyomanous right?
                i'm not blaming teachers, i'm blaming kahoot, don't worry
    Names like
        HappyDonkey or ExcitedOwl
            So basically those random Xbox gamertags you get when you sign up for Xbox Live?
                As far as my username...
... yeaaaah, I'm a creative dud. It's just my xbox username, but altered slightly. So yeah, it's the same thing, but even worse somehow.
    Slams a random adjective and animal together and puts 2 numbers at the end to make a name like CoolCat69
I don't think calamity mod is unpopular
    ~~i guess, but personally i believe it and the terraria modding community is underrated even with how big it is~~

edit, i know longer believe this and have changed my opinion as i didn't base this off of statistics but personal feal, this feal wrongly comes from how calamity mod content on this sub usually goes unnoticed again however i've changed my opinion
        Holy shit this man was crucified and resurrected
            Jesus himself now lol
        IMO 99% of the modding community still is underrated, it's just that the 1% that isn't is basically only Calamity and nothing else ^(sadly)
        [removed]
            lmao that was so unnecessarily aggressive
                Calamity fans who say that "calamity is pretty small" when its the biggest terraria mod in the world is like death grips fans saying its a "small band" and i hate it
                    Calamity is more popular than a lot of games
                        Calamity is more popular than Death Grips
                            Death Grips is more popular than a lot of games, for that matter.

The point being, if Calamity has 8.8 million downloads, then nearly a third of the community has downloaded it. Terraria has sold a little over 30 million copies.
                                It’s also probable that several people reinstalled the mod
                                    And many people who can't download it because they're not on pc
                        even terraria?
                    It’s like when people call a game with tens of millions of downloads an underrated indie gem.
                        Exactly
                    >death grips

Who?
                        Imagine like putting your hand in a blender and smashing your head against a stack of 43 plates while driving on the freeway, but with a black homeless man yelling at you from the backseat. Its like that
                            Ok so grindcore. What are some of their songs? Are they mired in sub-30 second songs?
                                I don't know and I don't want to know
                    Who is death grips
                A necessary evil my friend
            8.8 million? im sorry i had no clue that calamity alone was that big i was thinking about a quarter of that thank you for presenting me with this knowledge, i have changed my opinion
                Sorry mate, but this is the internet.
You can't acknowledge a mistake and change your opinion here, you just can stand by your position and start whining and insulting everyone when proven wrong
                    sorry mate, **I KNEEL TO NO BOUNDS OF THIS WORLD**

                                Don’t worry bro I also agree modded terraria is also very garbage, nothing beats the original. Modded adds to what needed nothing added and it feels overdone and feels like they tried to hard.
                                    i feel four things about this comment

1 why did you put this comment here as it's completely unrelated

2 i could not possibly disagree with something more

3 when writing a comment it's best to look over what you wrote so you properly   
   get what you mean across to the 'other side'

4 why you gotta break the chain
                                    Vanilla is good, but modded is better. The vast majority disagree with you.
                                    Yeah, that's kinda right. I like calamity because it Has it's own original story that doesn't feel like it was made forcibly. Makes it feel more connected to terraria.
            That's calamity fans for ya
        Your "feal" is fucking wrong. After someone finishes vanilla terraria and asks "what do I do?" he will be recommended to try mods, and try the calamity, as it adds a SHIT ton of things
            how is adding a lot of new and high quality content bad?

and why do you say it as "the fucking calamity" that curse is totally unnecessary and adds nothing to the overall sentence, and is grammatically incorrect

aside from that, what is the main part of this comment in witch i'd need to reconsider? if you have any differing opinions please tell me them i would be more than happy to consider them and likely add them to my own.
                >how is adding a lot of new and high quality content bad?

 I never said it's bad

>and why do you say it as "the fucking calamity" that curse is totally unnecessary and adds nothing to the overall sentence, and is grammatically incorrect

I got salty because you seemed to think that a only so few play calamity, so I added swear words. 

It has like 9 million downloads, so why title says "for 8 people that play calamity"?
                    He's just not informed


But I understand, I've been downvoted for liking trains, cars, caring about niche things and more because people don't care even though it's relevant

It pisses me off ngl
                    Ah I see, thanks for clearing that up I was going to edit the title to the amount of edits, but as the other guy said, i was uninformed and didn't know you couldn't edit titles.
Also 9 million? Last time I checked I thought it was 8.8 million. Or did you estimate?
                    I like how the guy is criticizing you for grammar, when he's clearly the one that's unable to properly utilize the english language.
        Found the kid who hasnt even touched a mod
            how?
Lmao i started playing calamity and have no fucking idea what I'm doing
    wiki will be your best friend until you've done abt 20 play throughs and know 5% of content off by heart
        Which is what I hate. When there is a wiki for a game, I will now have a checklist for the most worthwhile things. I will grind only those things and miss out on content that I ignore because it’s not the best weapon/armor in its class.
            There’s a wiki for nearly every game. Your only choice is to hate yourself for not being able to resist not wasting time. Also the guide in terraria was basically the compromise for the purists
            I wouldn't worry about the wiki. The Guide can help you get your bearing for any new loot you pick up; otherwise, there's enough stuff in Calamity that a lot of it ends up being optional, and you can basically stumble through progression blind and still get a lot of good stuff for any path forward you care to take.
            It’s annoying but games that more or less require you to have the wiki up on a second monitor are usually my favorites. Hard to get into but really rewarding to learn as much as the game has to offer. Path of Exile has been a favorite of mine for years for that reason. Knowing what you can do is really satisfying when you finally put it into motion.
                So true. Fallout, elder scrolls, and many more. I tried to play through Valheim without google but I had to a few times when I got stuck. The Forest is another that I could never finish without the wiki.
        i’ve done 2 almost playthroughs and i know most of it by heart now
    I recommend the recipe browser mod to easily look up items and there’s a bind to open the browser and a bind to search up the item your mouse is currently over, like guide
    nobody does, also if it's your first playthrough what mods thother than the main mod do you have (eg. calamites vanities or calamity mod music)
        none, just pure calamity
            You should probably add quality of life mods, atleast recipe browser magic storage and boss checklist
            Dude if you want your playthrough to be 10x easier, get veinminer, recipe browser, boss checklist, and if you're okay being a little bit cheaty, get luiafk and alchemistnpc too.
            well you really need to download calamity music the soundtrack is godly and almost necessary for a good calamity playthrough, if you dont believe me listen to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Syn1mJVt7U) and every theme is on par with things like this, trust me you're ruining your experience if you dont play with it

other than that some mods i recommend playing calamity with are:

calamity mod extra music it adds extra themes for all vanilla bosses except for ML and plant 

calamities vanities, adds a lot of vanities, mounts, and hooks although it starts off fairly memey at the start (looking at the morshu mount) as you progress it adds a lot of solid content (like the Profaned Cycle) 

 the calamity texture pack surprisingly adds textures for most sprites in the game, mainly so they can fit more with calamity (in terraria you balance around mods)

for other miscellaneous mods that you dont need as much but simply help with QoL i would go for the block swap, smart doors, and veinminer
                oh god you mentioned the soundtrack oh god the funny dragon wont get out my head THE FUNNY DRAGON WONT GET OUT MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY  HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF  MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET  OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD  GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY  HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF  MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET  OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD  GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY  HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF  MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET  OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD  GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY  HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF  MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET  OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD  GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY  HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF  MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET  OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD  GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY  HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF  MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET  OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD  GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY  HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD LEAVE ME ALONE FUNNY MESSAGE FOR MY MASTER DRAGON AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
                    bro i think *your mental fortitude is fading*
Just installed calamity yesterday, it’s a bit small but the content is good.
    A bit small?
        Satire
            Oh I get it you were making fun of the title
Pro tip focus on calamity
Calamity is gonna be the first mod I download when 1.4 tmodloader comes out. Sadly it seems like that's not gonna be for quite a while though...
    ya i'll probably give most mods a second playthrough considering what they might do with things like whips
Uhh calamity is one of the largest and most popular terraria mods
    do you read the comments before commenting? i've changed my opinion and the post title was a joke, i thought the community was relatively small as i rarely see atention to HQ calamity related posts
        So it wasn't entirely a joke if you did think the community was small
            correct! it was not entirely a joke, my viewpoint was flawed 

but there are quite a few people who didn't realise i was exaggerating that is the only reason why i was annoyed
extension post OG from [u/\_thicc\_ricc\_68419](https://www.reddit.com/user/_thicc_ricc_68419/)

at least using you real names you could do something creative like 'BoB the builder'
Name randomizer is fine, but that’s mostly because my schools name humor is boobass69
Ah yes, the most original boss from calamity, Brimstone Eye of Cthulhu
funny meme, god awful title
    before making this post i thought you could edit titles so i was going to edit it to the amount of upvotes it had
EnvasiveCrab72
    crabulon
I would play that mod but i only have mobile version
    time will come when you can get a pc and ~~play~~ die to yharon while you listen to his theme
teachers who use the name randomiser are worse than tyrant yharim
I like calamity but thorium is way better in my opinion
    Thorium fits better with Terraria’s Vibe than Calamity
        Agreed. Calamity made me feel like I was playing another game (which isn't a bad thing, but not for me) whereas Thorium almost felt like it was made by the Terraria devs themselves.
            Yeah, Thorium fits vanilla fantastically well, but I absolutely love the style of the Calamity sprites and the loads of content it adds.
        Well that’s kind of the point. Calamity is essentially a different game with all of its new mechanics, areas, and crazy plot whereas thorium is designed to expand on what the base game established.
        Agreed
I play with calamity!
[deleted]
    nah i was planning to edit the number that was there to the amount of upvotes, yaknow do something creative but i realised that you couldn't edit posts nearly as much as i thought
My favorite thing to do was do the randomized then make it look a lil different, like instead of cabbage camper, I’d make it to cabbage cannibal
Did you make this template?
    yes, if you want you can feel free to use it
        Wow, thank you!
            np
I understand
    thank you
At least with the real names you do get some freedom to do funny versions of your name.
Who else is in the club of listening to Calamity music when this post came up?
    we
We all know the mod. We're just too scared to play it.
    Why? You can easily lower the difficulty if you're having trouble considering how easy they made it to do so
\*80%
Relatable
For name randomizer instead of superpooper1 i got office
heck yea calamity mod my favorite
"For the 8 people" Calamity is the most well known Terraria mod and I think it has one of the biggest playerbases out of all the other game mods out there
    damn bro it almost like im joking and have responded to this same thing several times
Not gonna lie, calamity is only fun to play when you have friends to play with you.
    I kind of agree bc the game is way too difficult for me to beat on my own, plus talking to people makes mundane tasks such as mining a lot more fun
        I don’t really agree. I’m doing my first ever calamity play through and I accidentally did Revengance, and it’s not really difficult, I just beat Providence.
me who uses a custom name anyways

*i have no such weakness*
I believe you haven't played terraria if you haven't experienced Calamity.
    Mobile and consle players?
        as an old gen console player you can experience most of calamity without playing
Ngl imo Thorium is way better. Calamity bosses all have this odd Calamity look to them.
    ya calamity main focus around itself instead of not vinella unlike most other mods, hell it even made a texture pack to solve this, i dont get why people complain about this kind of stuff
        r/ihadastroke
            im sorry i will just erase a mental defect becaes i can defanatly do that
                Ok
        Are you a native English speaker?
            Yes, just stupid
                It's ok man I'm awful at typing sometimes
Kahoot with your own name is the saddest sight
Lmao i always set the name to Ceris and somehow people still doesnt knows who It Is after +15 games
8 people? Oh buddy, there is way more than that.
    im now more than aware of this
Honestly I think playing with a name randomizer is funner than playing with real names
Calamity is most definently not under the radar
calamity is probably the most popular mod idk what you are talking about
way more than 8 of us, mate
    if i see another post with the number 8 not understanding the joke i originally put up or how i've stated multiple times about how my opinions changed im going to create a bot to start auto replying
What are the bottom? Are they mods?
    yes from calamity id recommend checking it out with the music mod
        Thanks man, I’ve heard about this mod through chippy, but I’ve never actually seen it
            you should play it then
*...name randomizer?*
Im one of the 8
8? More like 80,000 lol
8 People? I wanna see that bot you made to auto reply.
    well i was going to but im stupid as fuck
        Sadness
Once got red lobster with kahoot randomizer
doesnt the calamity discord have like 50k people?

wouldnt that mean around 1 in 600 people who own terraria are in the discord?
    (Don't get into it. Just go with the meme.)
i couldn't believe clone calamitas was easy, i can't say the same to scal



Scal is really hard
    honestly i think SCal needs a buff, i beat her in three attempts flat i feel that with the difficulty of most bosses it's turning into a power fantasy more than you trying to fight a cosmos ruling tyrant
        true, i definitely think she needs a buff too.
            Ya especially compared to yharon I think most of the fight is really good, they should just do something with the brothers
u/objection-bot
Heck yeah SuperOryx is in first!
Ngl, kahoot is overated
    y o u h a v e b e e n m a r k e d
how dare you say only 8 use it make that 9
    Last I checked, I didn't count in the amount of players in Calamity's playerbase, so it's still 8.
I love calamity. Also tremor, thorium, joost, spirit, split.  I was forced to get the 64bit tmodloader to play em all togethrr
    tremor😐
i’ve only done one playthrough on 1.4 because calamity is just my life now
If I ever get a PC, and if I ever actually get good at thigs game by myself, I would love to try the calamity mod.
speaking of calamity what's a good way to get ceaseless void killed
    Last time I did it I accidentally cheesed it. My recommendation is to deal the most amount of damage in the least amount time to the orb thingies destroyed before you really have to deal with anything (strategy applies to many other bosses).

Alternatively, do not take my advice.
    mine an arena in the dungeon and use good crowd control weapons
More people have played calamity than people who have fished in lava in 1.4.1
    you would be correct but do you know what the lava charm is
        I am talking about the 1.4.1 achievement for fishing in lava
Doing an expert Thorium now but I’ve got Calamity ready for the moment I finish Thorium. I am taking my time tho
When u put a cuss word as a name and the kahoot AI replaces it with a random noun
I haven't tried calamity/modded playthroughs since right before 1.4 dropped. Any changes since tmod synced up with terraria? 

&#x200B;

I heard it still relies on an earlier version of terraria. Has the modloader + other mods work with 1.4 now? Or is that still months/years of progress away?
    my best guess is that it's around half a year away from 1.4 but don't take my word for it
        Yeah its hard to predict something like that, I appreciate though!
i would just have my name as peepee poopoo man
I’ve never played with the name randomizer before so I can’t understand the meme, yaaay I’m a loser
If you see this Ms. Szuszalski, FUCK you
thanks
Is that a mod or texture pack?

                r/Rickrollarmy would work fine
    lmao
Its a joke
    Wow who could’ve guessed
        I wasn’t talking to you
            Unless you dm someone, you're talking to everyone that can reply.
                So if this was irl and I was in the middle of a group of people talking and was talking to a specific person everyone else would be involved? If I wanted to say something that was directed toward a larger scope I wouldn’t reply to a specific comment. That’s pretty flawed logic
                    I think comparing a reddit comment to an irl group is pretty flawed logic.
                        Ok? So because there is a different medium of communication the rules have changed? Is there any specific etiquette for how replies operate?
                            Actually yes. One of the main rules is that anyone can reply to you if they want to. Because of the nature of it being text on a screen, multiple people can talk and be understood at the same time. This is unlike irl conversations because you might need to wait for someone else to complete their thought. This is also a public subreddit, so the group of people analogy was pretty weak. It's more like yelling a question into a crowd of thousands of people and only expecting a single person to reply.
                                [removed]
                                This would be a valid argument if there wasn’t some generalized logic in there but its not directed at the public, if other people do chip in thats fine. Still doesn’t change the fact that by *replying to a specific person by replying to a comment. You can do the same thing, but it would change nothing by the fact that your opinion does not matter to me because I wasn’t replying to you. I was replying to the other guy. This shouldn’t be really that hard to grasp.
                            Then why did you have to call the other dude out for responding to you, that’s perfectly fine, unless we are all going by “the rules” or “etiquette for how replies operate”
            i wasnt talking to you either
                ...no shit?
                    Unless you dm someone, you're talking to everyone that can reply.

    #*For the worthy flashbacks*
        ?
            Make your world an expert, hard world with the seed ‘For the Worthy’ and get hit by a slime once.
                I know what for the worthy is, I was curious what you meant by "for the worthy flashbacks". I now see that for the win has the same first letters as for the worthy. I was saying the kahoot name I commonly use is better than the random name generator's.
Yeah I want to be Cat Fucker 69 but noooooo
Like a kid in my class said, all they do is put and adjective in front of an animal name
HornyDinosaur69
its on the same level as Rec Room names
Damn those are like default xbox names
I'm fine w dat
But it's also calling him a cow .\_.
IHateTheNameRandomizerAhh1234
they introduced a random name generator that you could only spin 2 times where it just puts two 'safe' words from an extremely limited selection together, and after that you still need to ask students for names its clunky and takes along time to
    if you could choose from a list of words it would at least be bearable, but nooo they just HAVE to make it random, with ONLY 2 RESPINS

(i mean you can just put in the code again but still)
        As a teacher who uses the name randomized - I’m sorry! But there’s only so many times I can see Ben Dover, Mike Hunt, and Sascha Grey or w/e, even though secretly it makes me laugh.
            My personal favorite that I've had to ban from my room is "The School Kahooter." Actually kinda clever but if admin ever sees it, I'm in a lot of trouble.
            Can you explain the last name? I know the others, but I've never that one before.
                Sascha Grey was a famous porn star, there are other ones today students like using but I couldn’t remember their names.
                    Ah, I see. All I got was Sasha Grey when I looked her up. Thank you!
            That’s insane. Nobody in our class has the balls for that.
                I mean it’s anyomanous right?
            i'm not blaming teachers, i'm blaming kahoot, don't worry
Names like
    HappyDonkey or ExcitedOwl
        So basically those random Xbox gamertags you get when you sign up for Xbox Live?
            As far as my username...
... yeaaaah, I'm a creative dud. It's just my xbox username, but altered slightly. So yeah, it's the same thing, but even worse somehow.
Slams a random adjective and animal together and puts 2 numbers at the end to make a name like CoolCat69
~~i guess, but personally i believe it and the terraria modding community is underrated even with how big it is~~

edit, i know longer believe this and have changed my opinion as i didn't base this off of statistics but personal feal, this feal wrongly comes from how calamity mod content on this sub usually goes unnoticed again however i've changed my opinion
    Holy shit this man was crucified and resurrected
        Jesus himself now lol
    IMO 99% of the modding community still is underrated, it's just that the 1% that isn't is basically only Calamity and nothing else ^(sadly)
    [removed]
        lmao that was so unnecessarily aggressive
            Calamity fans who say that "calamity is pretty small" when its the biggest terraria mod in the world is like death grips fans saying its a "small band" and i hate it
                Calamity is more popular than a lot of games
                    Calamity is more popular than Death Grips
                        Death Grips is more popular than a lot of games, for that matter.

The point being, if Calamity has 8.8 million downloads, then nearly a third of the community has downloaded it. Terraria has sold a little over 30 million copies.
                            It’s also probable that several people reinstalled the mod
                                And many people who can't download it because they're not on pc
                    even terraria?
                It’s like when people call a game with tens of millions of downloads an underrated indie gem.
                    Exactly
                >death grips

Who?
                    Imagine like putting your hand in a blender and smashing your head against a stack of 43 plates while driving on the freeway, but with a black homeless man yelling at you from the backseat. Its like that
                        Ok so grindcore. What are some of their songs? Are they mired in sub-30 second songs?
                            I don't know and I don't want to know
                Who is death grips
            A necessary evil my friend
        8.8 million? im sorry i had no clue that calamity alone was that big i was thinking about a quarter of that thank you for presenting me with this knowledge, i have changed my opinion
            Sorry mate, but this is the internet.

                            Don’t worry bro I also agree modded terraria is also very garbage, nothing beats the original. Modded adds to what needed nothing added and it feels overdone and feels like they tried to hard.
                                i feel four things about this comment

1 why did you put this comment here as it's completely unrelated

2 i could not possibly disagree with something more

3 when writing a comment it's best to look over what you wrote so you properly   
   get what you mean across to the 'other side'

4 why you gotta break the chain
                                Vanilla is good, but modded is better. The vast majority disagree with you.
                                Yeah, that's kinda right. I like calamity because it Has it's own original story that doesn't feel like it was made forcibly. Makes it feel more connected to terraria.
        That's calamity fans for ya
    Your "feal" is fucking wrong. After someone finishes vanilla terraria and asks "what do I do?" he will be recommended to try mods, and try the calamity, as it adds a SHIT ton of things
        how is adding a lot of new and high quality content bad?

and why do you say it as "the fucking calamity" that curse is totally unnecessary and adds nothing to the overall sentence, and is grammatically incorrect

aside from that, what is the main part of this comment in witch i'd need to reconsider? if you have any differing opinions please tell me them i would be more than happy to consider them and likely add them to my own.
            >how is adding a lot of new and high quality content bad?

 I never said it's bad

>and why do you say it as "the fucking calamity" that curse is totally unnecessary and adds nothing to the overall sentence, and is grammatically incorrect

I got salty because you seemed to think that a only so few play calamity, so I added swear words. 

It has like 9 million downloads, so why title says "for 8 people that play calamity"?
                He's just not informed


But I understand, I've been downvoted for liking trains, cars, caring about niche things and more because people don't care even though it's relevant

It pisses me off ngl
                Ah I see, thanks for clearing that up I was going to edit the title to the amount of edits, but as the other guy said, i was uninformed and didn't know you couldn't edit titles.
Also 9 million? Last time I checked I thought it was 8.8 million. Or did you estimate?
                I like how the guy is criticizing you for grammar, when he's clearly the one that's unable to properly utilize the english language.
    Found the kid who hasnt even touched a mod
        how?
wiki will be your best friend until you've done abt 20 play throughs and know 5% of content off by heart
    Which is what I hate. When there is a wiki for a game, I will now have a checklist for the most worthwhile things. I will grind only those things and miss out on content that I ignore because it’s not the best weapon/armor in its class.
        There’s a wiki for nearly every game. Your only choice is to hate yourself for not being able to resist not wasting time. Also the guide in terraria was basically the compromise for the purists
        I wouldn't worry about the wiki. The Guide can help you get your bearing for any new loot you pick up; otherwise, there's enough stuff in Calamity that a lot of it ends up being optional, and you can basically stumble through progression blind and still get a lot of good stuff for any path forward you care to take.
        It’s annoying but games that more or less require you to have the wiki up on a second monitor are usually my favorites. Hard to get into but really rewarding to learn as much as the game has to offer. Path of Exile has been a favorite of mine for years for that reason. Knowing what you can do is really satisfying when you finally put it into motion.
            So true. Fallout, elder scrolls, and many more. I tried to play through Valheim without google but I had to a few times when I got stuck. The Forest is another that I could never finish without the wiki.
    i’ve done 2 almost playthroughs and i know most of it by heart now
I recommend the recipe browser mod to easily look up items and there’s a bind to open the browser and a bind to search up the item your mouse is currently over, like guide
nobody does, also if it's your first playthrough what mods thother than the main mod do you have (eg. calamites vanities or calamity mod music)
    none, just pure calamity
        You should probably add quality of life mods, atleast recipe browser magic storage and boss checklist
        Dude if you want your playthrough to be 10x easier, get veinminer, recipe browser, boss checklist, and if you're okay being a little bit cheaty, get luiafk and alchemistnpc too.
        well you really need to download calamity music the soundtrack is godly and almost necessary for a good calamity playthrough, if you dont believe me listen to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Syn1mJVt7U) and every theme is on par with things like this, trust me you're ruining your experience if you dont play with it

other than that some mods i recommend playing calamity with are:

calamity mod extra music it adds extra themes for all vanilla bosses except for ML and plant 

calamities vanities, adds a lot of vanities, mounts, and hooks although it starts off fairly memey at the start (looking at the morshu mount) as you progress it adds a lot of solid content (like the Profaned Cycle) 

 the calamity texture pack surprisingly adds textures for most sprites in the game, mainly so they can fit more with calamity (in terraria you balance around mods)

for other miscellaneous mods that you dont need as much but simply help with QoL i would go for the block swap, smart doors, and veinminer
            oh god you mentioned the soundtrack oh god the funny dragon wont get out my head THE FUNNY DRAGON WONT GET OUT MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY  HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF  MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET  OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD  GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY  HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF  MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET  OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD  GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY  HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF  MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET  OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD  GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY  HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF  MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET  OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD  GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY  HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF  MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET  OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD  GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY  HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF  MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET  OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD  GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY  HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD LEAVE ME ALONE FUNNY MESSAGE FOR MY MASTER DRAGON AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

    Satire
        Oh I get it you were making fun of the title
ya i'll probably give most mods a second playthrough considering what they might do with things like whips
do you read the comments before commenting? i've changed my opinion and the post title was a joke, i thought the community was relatively small as i rarely see atention to HQ calamity related posts
    So it wasn't entirely a joke if you did think the community was small
        correct! it was not entirely a joke, my viewpoint was flawed 

but there are quite a few people who didn't realise i was exaggerating that is the only reason why i was annoyed
before making this post i thought you could edit titles so i was going to edit it to the amount of upvotes it had

Thorium fits better with Terraria’s Vibe than Calamity
    Agreed. Calamity made me feel like I was playing another game (which isn't a bad thing, but not for me) whereas Thorium almost felt like it was made by the Terraria devs themselves.
        Yeah, Thorium fits vanilla fantastically well, but I absolutely love the style of the Calamity sprites and the loads of content it adds.
    Well that’s kind of the point. Calamity is essentially a different game with all of its new mechanics, areas, and crazy plot whereas thorium is designed to expand on what the base game established.
    Agreed
nah i was planning to edit the number that was there to the amount of upvotes, yaknow do something creative but i realised that you couldn't edit posts nearly as much as i thought
yes, if you want you can feel free to use it
    Wow, thank you!
        np
thank you

Why? You can easily lower the difficulty if you're having trouble considering how easy they made it to do so
damn bro it almost like im joking and have responded to this same thing several times
I kind of agree bc the game is way too difficult for me to beat on my own, plus talking to people makes mundane tasks such as mining a lot more fun
    I don’t really agree. I’m doing my first ever calamity play through and I accidentally did Revengance, and it’s not really difficult, I just beat Providence.
Mobile and consle players?
    as an old gen console player you can experience most of calamity without playing
ya calamity main focus around itself instead of not vinella unlike most other mods, hell it even made a texture pack to solve this, i dont get why people complain about this kind of stuff

        im sorry i will just erase a mental defect becaes i can defanatly do that

        Yes, just stupid
            It's ok man I'm awful at typing sometimes
im now more than aware of this
if i see another post with the number 8 not understanding the joke i originally put up or how i've stated multiple times about how my opinions changed im going to create a bot to start auto replying
yes from calamity id recommend checking it out with the music mod
    Thanks man, I’ve heard about this mod through chippy, but I’ve never actually seen it
        you should play it then
well i was going to but im stupid as fuck
    Sadness
(Don't get into it. Just go with the meme.)
honestly i think SCal needs a buff, i beat her in three attempts flat i feel that with the difficulty of most bosses it's turning into a power fantasy more than you trying to fight a cosmos ruling tyrant
    true, i definitely think she needs a buff too.
        Ya especially compared to yharon I think most of the fight is really good, they should just do something with the brothers
y o u h a v e b e e n m a r k e d
Last I checked, I didn't count in the amount of players in Calamity's playerbase, so it's still 8.

            ...no shit?

#*For the worthy flashbacks*
    ?
        Make your world an expert, hard world with the seed ‘For the Worthy’ and get hit by a slime once.
            I know what for the worthy is, I was curious what you meant by "for the worthy flashbacks". I now see that for the win has the same first letters as for the worthy. I was saying the kahoot name I commonly use is better than the random name generator's.
if you could choose from a list of words it would at least be bearable, but nooo they just HAVE to make it random, with ONLY 2 RESPINS

(i mean you can just put in the code again but still)
    As a teacher who uses the name randomized - I’m sorry! But there’s only so many times I can see Ben Dover, Mike Hunt, and Sascha Grey or w/e, even though secretly it makes me laugh.
        My personal favorite that I've had to ban from my room is "The School Kahooter." Actually kinda clever but if admin ever sees it, I'm in a lot of trouble.
        Can you explain the last name? I know the others, but I've never that one before.
            Sascha Grey was a famous porn star, there are other ones today students like using but I couldn’t remember their names.
                Ah, I see. All I got was Sasha Grey when I looked her up. Thank you!
        That’s insane. Nobody in our class has the balls for that.
            I mean it’s anyomanous right?
        i'm not blaming teachers, i'm blaming kahoot, don't worry
HappyDonkey or ExcitedOwl
    So basically those random Xbox gamertags you get when you sign up for Xbox Live?
        As far as my username...
... yeaaaah, I'm a creative dud. It's just my xbox username, but altered slightly. So yeah, it's the same thing, but even worse somehow.
Holy shit this man was crucified and resurrected
    Jesus himself now lol
IMO 99% of the modding community still is underrated, it's just that the 1% that isn't is basically only Calamity and nothing else ^(sadly)
[removed]
    lmao that was so unnecessarily aggressive
        Calamity fans who say that "calamity is pretty small" when its the biggest terraria mod in the world is like death grips fans saying its a "small band" and i hate it
            Calamity is more popular than a lot of games
                Calamity is more popular than Death Grips
                    Death Grips is more popular than a lot of games, for that matter.

The point being, if Calamity has 8.8 million downloads, then nearly a third of the community has downloaded it. Terraria has sold a little over 30 million copies.
                        It’s also probable that several people reinstalled the mod
                            And many people who can't download it because they're not on pc
                even terraria?
            It’s like when people call a game with tens of millions of downloads an underrated indie gem.
                Exactly
            >death grips

Who?
                Imagine like putting your hand in a blender and smashing your head against a stack of 43 plates while driving on the freeway, but with a black homeless man yelling at you from the backseat. Its like that
                    Ok so grindcore. What are some of their songs? Are they mired in sub-30 second songs?
                        I don't know and I don't want to know
            Who is death grips
        A necessary evil my friend
    8.8 million? im sorry i had no clue that calamity alone was that big i was thinking about a quarter of that thank you for presenting me with this knowledge, i have changed my opinion
        Sorry mate, but this is the internet.
You can't acknowledge a mistake and change your opinion here, you just can stand by your position and start whining and insulting everyone when proven wrong

                        Don’t worry bro I also agree modded terraria is also very garbage, nothing beats the original. Modded adds to what needed nothing added and it feels overdone and feels like they tried to hard.
                            i feel four things about this comment

1 why did you put this comment here as it's completely unrelated

2 i could not possibly disagree with something more

3 when writing a comment it's best to look over what you wrote so you properly   
   get what you mean across to the 'other side'

4 why you gotta break the chain
                            Vanilla is good, but modded is better. The vast majority disagree with you.
                            Yeah, that's kinda right. I like calamity because it Has it's own original story that doesn't feel like it was made forcibly. Makes it feel more connected to terraria.
    That's calamity fans for ya
Your "feal" is fucking wrong. After someone finishes vanilla terraria and asks "what do I do?" he will be recommended to try mods, and try the calamity, as it adds a SHIT ton of things
    how is adding a lot of new and high quality content bad?

and why do you say it as "the fucking calamity" that curse is totally unnecessary and adds nothing to the overall sentence, and is grammatically incorrect

aside from that, what is the main part of this comment in witch i'd need to reconsider? if you have any differing opinions please tell me them i would be more than happy to consider them and likely add them to my own.
        >how is adding a lot of new and high quality content bad?

 I never said it's bad

>and why do you say it as "the fucking calamity" that curse is totally unnecessary and adds nothing to the overall sentence, and is grammatically incorrect

I got salty because you seemed to think that a only so few play calamity, so I added swear words. 

It has like 9 million downloads, so why title says "for 8 people that play calamity"?
            He's just not informed


But I understand, I've been downvoted for liking trains, cars, caring about niche things and more because people don't care even though it's relevant

It pisses me off ngl
            Ah I see, thanks for clearing that up I was going to edit the title to the amount of edits, but as the other guy said, i was uninformed and didn't know you couldn't edit titles.
Also 9 million? Last time I checked I thought it was 8.8 million. Or did you estimate?
            I like how the guy is criticizing you for grammar, when he's clearly the one that's unable to properly utilize the english language.
Found the kid who hasnt even touched a mod
    how?
Which is what I hate. When there is a wiki for a game, I will now have a checklist for the most worthwhile things. I will grind only those things and miss out on content that I ignore because it’s not the best weapon/armor in its class.
    There’s a wiki for nearly every game. Your only choice is to hate yourself for not being able to resist not wasting time. Also the guide in terraria was basically the compromise for the purists
    I wouldn't worry about the wiki. The Guide can help you get your bearing for any new loot you pick up; otherwise, there's enough stuff in Calamity that a lot of it ends up being optional, and you can basically stumble through progression blind and still get a lot of good stuff for any path forward you care to take.
    It’s annoying but games that more or less require you to have the wiki up on a second monitor are usually my favorites. Hard to get into but really rewarding to learn as much as the game has to offer. Path of Exile has been a favorite of mine for years for that reason. Knowing what you can do is really satisfying when you finally put it into motion.
        So true. Fallout, elder scrolls, and many more. I tried to play through Valheim without google but I had to a few times when I got stuck. The Forest is another that I could never finish without the wiki.
i’ve done 2 almost playthroughs and i know most of it by heart now
none, just pure calamity
    You should probably add quality of life mods, atleast recipe browser magic storage and boss checklist
    Dude if you want your playthrough to be 10x easier, get veinminer, recipe browser, boss checklist, and if you're okay being a little bit cheaty, get luiafk and alchemistnpc too.
    well you really need to download calamity music the soundtrack is godly and almost necessary for a good calamity playthrough, if you dont believe me listen to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Syn1mJVt7U) and every theme is on par with things like this, trust me you're ruining your experience if you dont play with it

other than that some mods i recommend playing calamity with are:

calamity mod extra music it adds extra themes for all vanilla bosses except for ML and plant 

calamities vanities, adds a lot of vanities, mounts, and hooks although it starts off fairly memey at the start (looking at the morshu mount) as you progress it adds a lot of solid content (like the Profaned Cycle) 

 the calamity texture pack surprisingly adds textures for most sprites in the game, mainly so they can fit more with calamity (in terraria you balance around mods)

for other miscellaneous mods that you dont need as much but simply help with QoL i would go for the block swap, smart doors, and veinminer

            bro i think *your mental fortitude is fading*
Satire
    Oh I get it you were making fun of the title
So it wasn't entirely a joke if you did think the community was small
    correct! it was not entirely a joke, my viewpoint was flawed 

but there are quite a few people who didn't realise i was exaggerating that is the only reason why i was annoyed
Agreed. Calamity made me feel like I was playing another game (which isn't a bad thing, but not for me) whereas Thorium almost felt like it was made by the Terraria devs themselves.
    Yeah, Thorium fits vanilla fantastically well, but I absolutely love the style of the Calamity sprites and the loads of content it adds.
Well that’s kind of the point. Calamity is essentially a different game with all of its new mechanics, areas, and crazy plot whereas thorium is designed to expand on what the base game established.
Agreed
Wow, thank you!
    np
I don’t really agree. I’m doing my first ever calamity play through and I accidentally did Revengance, and it’s not really difficult, I just beat Providence.
as an old gen console player you can experience most of calamity without playing

        r/Rickrollarmy would work fine
I wasn’t talking to you
    Unless you dm someone, you're talking to everyone that can reply.
        So if this was irl and I was in the middle of a group of people talking and was talking to a specific person everyone else would be involved? If I wanted to say something that was directed toward a larger scope I wouldn’t reply to a specific comment. That’s pretty flawed logic
            I think comparing a reddit comment to an irl group is pretty flawed logic.
                Ok? So because there is a different medium of communication the rules have changed? Is there any specific etiquette for how replies operate?
                    Actually yes. One of the main rules is that anyone can reply to you if they want to. Because of the nature of it being text on a screen, multiple people can talk and be understood at the same time. This is unlike irl conversations because you might need to wait for someone else to complete their thought. This is also a public subreddit, so the group of people analogy was pretty weak. It's more like yelling a question into a crowd of thousands of people and only expecting a single person to reply.
                        [removed]
                        This would be a valid argument if there wasn’t some generalized logic in there but its not directed at the public, if other people do chip in thats fine. Still doesn’t change the fact that by *replying to a specific person by replying to a comment. You can do the same thing, but it would change nothing by the fact that your opinion does not matter to me because I wasn’t replying to you. I was replying to the other guy. This shouldn’t be really that hard to grasp.
                    Then why did you have to call the other dude out for responding to you, that’s perfectly fine, unless we are all going by “the rules” or “etiquette for how replies operate”
    i wasnt talking to you either

There’s a wiki for nearly every game. Your only choice is to hate yourself for not being able to resist not wasting time. Also the guide in terraria was basically the compromise for the purists
I wouldn't worry about the wiki. The Guide can help you get your bearing for any new loot you pick up; otherwise, there's enough stuff in Calamity that a lot of it ends up being optional, and you can basically stumble through progression blind and still get a lot of good stuff for any path forward you care to take.
It’s annoying but games that more or less require you to have the wiki up on a second monitor are usually my favorites. Hard to get into but really rewarding to learn as much as the game has to offer. Path of Exile has been a favorite of mine for years for that reason. Knowing what you can do is really satisfying when you finally put it into motion.
    So true. Fallout, elder scrolls, and many more. I tried to play through Valheim without google but I had to a few times when I got stuck. The Forest is another that I could never finish without the wiki.
You should probably add quality of life mods, atleast recipe browser magic storage and boss checklist
Dude if you want your playthrough to be 10x easier, get veinminer, recipe browser, boss checklist, and if you're okay being a little bit cheaty, get luiafk and alchemistnpc too.
well you really need to download calamity music the soundtrack is godly and almost necessary for a good calamity playthrough, if you dont believe me listen to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Syn1mJVt7U) and every theme is on par with things like this, trust me you're ruining your experience if you dont play with it

other than that some mods i recommend playing calamity with are:

calamity mod extra music it adds extra themes for all vanilla bosses except for ML and plant 

calamities vanities, adds a lot of vanities, mounts, and hooks although it starts off fairly memey at the start (looking at the morshu mount) as you progress it adds a lot of solid content (like the Profaned Cycle) 

 the calamity texture pack surprisingly adds textures for most sprites in the game, mainly so they can fit more with calamity (in terraria you balance around mods)

for other miscellaneous mods that you dont need as much but simply help with QoL i would go for the block swap, smart doors, and veinminer

        bro i think *your mental fortitude is fading*
Oh I get it you were making fun of the title
correct! it was not entirely a joke, my viewpoint was flawed 

but there are quite a few people who didn't realise i was exaggerating that is the only reason why i was annoyed
Yeah, Thorium fits vanilla fantastically well, but I absolutely love the style of the Calamity sprites and the loads of content it adds.
np
im sorry i will just erase a mental defect becaes i can defanatly do that
    Ok
Yes, just stupid
    It's ok man I'm awful at typing sometimes
you should play it then
Ya especially compared to yharon I think most of the fight is really good, they should just do something with the brothers
I want to r/ this but I don't know a good one...
    r/Rickrollarmy would work fine
Unless you dm someone, you're talking to everyone that can reply.
    So if this was irl and I was in the middle of a group of people talking and was talking to a specific person everyone else would be involved? If I wanted to say something that was directed toward a larger scope I wouldn’t reply to a specific comment. That’s pretty flawed logic
        I think comparing a reddit comment to an irl group is pretty flawed logic.
            Ok? So because there is a different medium of communication the rules have changed? Is there any specific etiquette for how replies operate?
                Actually yes. One of the main rules is that anyone can reply to you if they want to. Because of the nature of it being text on a screen, multiple people can talk and be understood at the same time. This is unlike irl conversations because you might need to wait for someone else to complete their thought. This is also a public subreddit, so the group of people analogy was pretty weak. It's more like yelling a question into a crowd of thousands of people and only expecting a single person to reply.
                    [removed]
                    This would be a valid argument if there wasn’t some generalized logic in there but its not directed at the public, if other people do chip in thats fine. Still doesn’t change the fact that by *replying to a specific person by replying to a comment. You can do the same thing, but it would change nothing by the fact that your opinion does not matter to me because I wasn’t replying to you. I was replying to the other guy. This shouldn’t be really that hard to grasp.
                Then why did you have to call the other dude out for responding to you, that’s perfectly fine, unless we are all going by “the rules” or “etiquette for how replies operate”
i wasnt talking to you either
    ...no shit?
        Unless you dm someone, you're talking to everyone that can reply.
i mean, you can't deny that cats/dogs are better than mosquitoes tho...
    But what if you can train a swarm of mosquitoes to attack people on command?

    One time I got MrUnderpants87
Make your world an expert, hard world with the seed ‘For the Worthy’ and get hit by a slime once.
    I know what for the worthy is, I was curious what you meant by "for the worthy flashbacks". I now see that for the win has the same first letters as for the worthy. I was saying the kahoot name I commonly use is better than the random name generator's.
My personal favorite that I've had to ban from my room is "The School Kahooter." Actually kinda clever but if admin ever sees it, I'm in a lot of trouble.
Can you explain the last name? I know the others, but I've never that one before.
    Sascha Grey was a famous porn star, there are other ones today students like using but I couldn’t remember their names.
        Ah, I see. All I got was Sasha Grey when I looked her up. Thank you!
That’s insane. Nobody in our class has the balls for that.
    I mean it’s anyomanous right?
i'm not blaming teachers, i'm blaming kahoot, don't worry
As far as my username...
... yeaaaah, I'm a creative dud. It's just my xbox username, but altered slightly. So yeah, it's the same thing, but even worse somehow.
Calamity fans who say that "calamity is pretty small" when its the biggest terraria mod in the world is like death grips fans saying its a "small band" and i hate it
    Calamity is more popular than a lot of games
        Calamity is more popular than Death Grips
            Death Grips is more popular than a lot of games, for that matter.

The point being, if Calamity has 8.8 million downloads, then nearly a third of the community has downloaded it. Terraria has sold a little over 30 million copies.
                It’s also probable that several people reinstalled the mod
                    And many people who can't download it because they're not on pc
        even terraria?
    It’s like when people call a game with tens of millions of downloads an underrated indie gem.
        Exactly
    >death grips

Who?
        Imagine like putting your hand in a blender and smashing your head against a stack of 43 plates while driving on the freeway, but with a black homeless man yelling at you from the backseat. Its like that
            Ok so grindcore. What are some of their songs? Are they mired in sub-30 second songs?
                I don't know and I don't want to know
    Who is death grips
A necessary evil my friend
Sorry mate, but this is the internet.
You can't acknowledge a mistake and change your opinion here, you just can stand by your position and start whining and insulting everyone when proven wrong

                Don’t worry bro I also agree modded terraria is also very garbage, nothing beats the original. Modded adds to what needed nothing added and it feels overdone and feels like they tried to hard.
                    i feel four things about this comment

1 why did you put this comment here as it's completely unrelated

2 i could not possibly disagree with something more

3 when writing a comment it's best to look over what you wrote so you properly   
   get what you mean across to the 'other side'

4 why you gotta break the chain
                    Vanilla is good, but modded is better. The vast majority disagree with you.
                    Yeah, that's kinda right. I like calamity because it Has it's own original story that doesn't feel like it was made forcibly. Makes it feel more connected to terraria.
>how is adding a lot of new and high quality content bad?

 I never said it's bad

>and why do you say it as "the fucking calamity" that curse is totally unnecessary and adds nothing to the overall sentence, and is grammatically incorrect

I got salty because you seemed to think that a only so few play calamity, so I added swear words. 

It has like 9 million downloads, so why title says "for 8 people that play calamity"?
    He's just not informed


But I understand, I've been downvoted for liking trains, cars, caring about niche things and more because people don't care even though it's relevant

It pisses me off ngl
    Ah I see, thanks for clearing that up I was going to edit the title to the amount of edits, but as the other guy said, i was uninformed and didn't know you couldn't edit titles.
Also 9 million? Last time I checked I thought it was 8.8 million. Or did you estimate?
    I like how the guy is criticizing you for grammar, when he's clearly the one that's unable to properly utilize the english language.
So true. Fallout, elder scrolls, and many more. I tried to play through Valheim without google but I had to a few times when I got stuck. The Forest is another that I could never finish without the wiki.
