[[Calamity Mod got updated to tML 1.4 half an hour ago!]]





lol of course the first thing they do is nerf soaring insignia
    but.. why? Most of the bosses already dissable infinite flight?
        >Most of the bosses already dissable infinite flight

what, why? that sounds dumb
            yeah, it is
                calamity devs hate fun in general
                    you don‚Äôt enjoy dozens of bullet bell boss fights with .1%  chance of dropping the item you want that becomes completely useless once you beat the next boss?
                        wait till calamity loot swap comes in, or Better yet just get alchemist npc Operator and a shitton of platinum and buy the bags
                            Calamity devs on their way to make the mod uncompatible with Alchemist NPC and many other QoL mods
                                Bam, re compatibility patch specifically that requires calamity and alchemist  or whatever mod so MAKE it compatible again.
                                dont give them ideias
                        The 1% drops get stronger the further you get into the game so the weapons don‚Äôt fall off too fast.
                            That's *ooooooold* Calamity, man. Legendary drops haven't scaled in *YEARS*.
                                Wait so halibut cannon used to get better, does it not now?
                                    Halibut still does. All the other old legendaries like Aegis Blade, Blossom Flux, etc. don't anymore (and in my opinion, they're in the least creative and most unrewarding state they've ever been in).
                    They pander to try hards and masochists, have you seen the levels in difficulty they added
                        brother if you think a higher level of difficulty thats basically a way superior master mode without being simply damage buffs to enemies means its for masochist then look at master mode for the worthy hardcore no wasd copper shortsword only
                    Calamity devs had a very different idea of fun a few years ago. Maybe Dokuro stepping down messed with Drew in some way, but the mod took a huge turn for the lame in the past few updates.
                    [removed]
                        [removed]
                    yeah thats why there are countless QOL changes that make the game more fun then i spose
                    Not every mod is tailored to your play style. Making dumbass statements like that reflects poorly on yourself, I'd recommend avoiding that in the future.
                        Chill brother, I like playing Calamity but it's undeniable that the devs make some questionable decisions regarding fun. Don't know why you got all offended about it though. You don't need to be so protective of a terraria mod lmao.
                            Not every mod is tailored to your play style. Making dumbass statements like that reflects poorly on yourself, I'd recommend avoiding that in the future.
                    Don‚Äôt play it then
                        Is this a Fabsol alt?
                        not happ'n'n
        theres very few bosses that do this and its not even a big deal
            exactly, there's no reason to nerf Soaring Insignia
                The primary effect of it isnt even the infinite flight, its the DOUBLED vertical acceleration which is mad. Infinite flight is pretty good but if youre good with your hook its not a game changer but pretty good, to be fair the item was over-nerfed but it was busted before with the unopposed flight mobility.
    Thankfully there's a mod that combines it with the terra boots , so we still can use it without the nerf
        First time I heard someone talk about my mod, that's pretty neat

I'll have to try if it actually works with the calamity nerfs because if calamity overrides the correct thing it would also affect my boots
            Doing God's work bro üôè
            Not really, if you set up the new accessory with weird loopholes like +9999 flight time instead of flightTime = max (i haven't worked with flight time so excuse my ignorance if this is wrong)
                I don't use flight time at all, there is a parameter called empressBrooch that I just set to true.But Calamity overrides that exact parameter so I'll just set flight time to max or a really high value with a config if someone likes the calamity nerf
                    Ah that would make sense. I think you could just have the accessory have that max time you're talking about, since the rocket boots add to the flight time of wings, so it makes sense for other accessories to increase the flight time as eell
            What is your mod
        ngl, that mod is probably the only way the Soaring Insignia would be worthwhile when using a large mod like Calamity.  No matter how useful it is, an accessory with one and a half really good effects pales in comparison to an accessory with a handful of good effects with how limited accessory slots are.
            antisocial is so good if you wanna have more accesory slots, but you might think its cheaty
        Can I get the name of the mod, pretty please?
            https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2564474517
                Ty mate.
        I would also like to request the mods name if you'd be so kind
            https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2564474517
        Also Fargo and Stars Above aka the big anti-Fabsol shield.
        Just wanted to tell that there is now a config where you can decide if you want the nerf to apply for the boots as well or not (The default value is to ignore the nerf and grant infinite flight anyways)
        Mod name please
            https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2564474517
        yeah that seems balanced
    Well of course they do, Calamity devs hate fun.
        Not fun, just fun that differs from their own ideas. No one is allowed to use QOL mods, the nurse, nothing that changes fabsol's idea of how his mod should be played.
            Damn, I feel the stuck-upness through the screen, ESPECIALLY from a guy, whose half of ideas consists of stealing everything possible from MGR:R (one-off references are okay, but when your most powerful weapon is directly from that game without name changes, and you incorporate the absolutely not fitting health UI into Terraria, then it gets kinda suspect) and spongify vanilla bosses for "challenge"
                Fabsol seems like he's trying to take Calamity in two different directions at the same time. All of the MGR references are fun nods to (presumably) fab's favorite game, which he's totally allowed to do. It's literally his mod, after all. However, at the same time, he's trying to turn "Terraria" into "Calamity." The Health UI and boss AI changes definitely make it feel like Calamity is designed as its own experience, and while that's also totally okay, the way that "mod with a bunch of references made for fun" and "mod that's designed to overhaul your entire play experience" mix in Calamity is not done well. I personally love Calamity. I always have, and I play the shit out of it whenever I can, but it's definitely got its problems.
            well i play with ore excavator, Alchemist, overhaul, ther content mods and Luiafk 

mainly because i suck at the game without these but that doesn‚Äôt matter
            [deleted]
                They don't. QoL mods are unaffected, the nurse is disabled when a boss is alive solely when playing in Death mode, etc.
                they dont
                They don't.
            dude nothing is stoping you from playing without those, alchemist npc is still usable and so is ore excavator
            What's he gonna do about it?
                Nerf a bunch of things people found fun.
                    he does that anyways
        Its not that bad is it?
            Calamity? Calamity is fine. Some well made, interesting content. But the devs hate any alternate way of playing the game other than their very firm vision and will work in nerfs to alternate playstyles. Hard. Hence soaring insignia being heavily nerfed.
                This whole Calamity thing reminds me of Gregtech drama from Minecraft's FeedtheBeast (FtB) mod packs way back in the day. 


Sorry for the long post.
TLDR; Greg liked Grind=Power and applied it to a ton popular mods in modpacks that included his Gregtech mod. Players didn't like having to spend a lot of time to get simple automation. Mod Creators had their own vision for their mod and didn't like him messing with it. It caused a lot of drama.


And now the post:
For those that don't know FtB mod packs were a bundle of minecraft mods that usually focused on factory building and industrialization. Think Factorio before Factorio existed.


One of the mods included was called Gregtech which was a mid-endgame expansion to the very popular Industrialcraft 2 mod.  Greg was the mod creator and had a mindset of working hard to earn powerful rewards. If you got to endgame with this mod it delivered on this vision with some ludicrously strong production, storage, sorting, and power generation.


The problem came in with the fact that Greg thought this mindset should be applied to all mods in a mod pack that included Gregtech and a lot of the popular modpacks had Gregtech included. Greg would adjust the recipes of machines from other mods to make them significantly more time consuming and expensive. For example a simple flint and steel went from 1 flint and 1 iron ingot to 1 flint and 1 steel ingot. A steel ingot required a few different machines to produce as opposed to iron only needing a furnace.


This irked a lot of players and mod creators. A good chunk of players didn't like the added grind to everything and the factory building part of the mod pack took significantly longer to both get to and build.  Mod creators were quite annoyed since they had their own vision of how their progression in their mod worked and communication with Greg was apparently frustrating.


Eventually the outcry got loud enough that the modpack creators split packs into a version that included Gregtech and one that didnt. Also mod creators were creating their own recipie "packs" that you could swap to in the config file and usually included a "Vanilla" version. Not entirely sure what happened after the split as shortly after that I stopped playing FtB for a while.
                    Good explanation. However, instead of explaining all this you can just tell to anyone curious to play GT NH (GregTech: New Horizons) and it will be self-explanatory
                        Thank you! This Calamity drama just kinda dug out a memory from like 9 years ago. I haven't played as much FtB or FtB styled modpacks in recent years and don't really know what Gregtech New Horizons is, but given who he is my guess is that it is months worth of grind with increasingly complex systems that end in you becoming some kind of industrial god.
                            Cool to see someone who was around back then in the wild! I still remember playing RedPower and looking at the movable frames - it was like Create, years before Create
                                Yea man it was some good times. My friend group had a whole server running with the Ultimate pack and we had some fun coming up with factories that combined multiple mods into an amalgam of industry.
                                    I loved that. Have you played modded Minecraft recently? Create: Above and Beyond was a great modpack (although endgame was kind of too math-ey for me)
                    I haven't heard about calamities developers much but the sentiment here reminds me of Starbounds Frackin Universe dev and similar criticisms going towards him. He literally made an update to his mod that detected another mod that reverted a nerf he made to a certain planet type(making them useless to visit). In the code he made a line called ''Idiot Check'' which checks if people are using the mod, and essentially causes every weather effect to happen at the same time and kill the player.  He's had a history of doing other things in that ballpark but holy moly that was ridiculous.
                It's funny. As soon as I encountered the insignia when 1.4 came out my first thought regarding modded was "oh yeah, calamity is gonna make this useless"
                That, plus the artstyle/UI clashes (just some of the artstyle doesn't fit terraria at all), most bosses being either the souped-up versions of vanilla bosses or touhou-like bullet hells, and visual effect overload that only plummets performance on my laptop are the reasons why I didn't wind up playing Calamity
                    THIS this right here. It's the attempts at re-writing the lore that get me the worst, the art looks like it belongs in Starbound instead of Terraria, and everything that the devs have written reads like something a 13 year old AOL roleplayer from the 90s wrote.
                        At this point calamity feels like a diffrent game so I dont see a point complaining about it having a diffrent art style or weird lore.
                        You mean, re-writting terraria's official, OPTIONAL, lore that's very basic and mediocre at best? Yeah, the lore is bad, but it's getting fixed to be better written, so this could all change. Terraria also got more and more detailed art style, see EoL. The art style is a matter of TASTES my dude. There are texture packs for a reason, and mods shouldn't be forced to cater to one artstyle as many mods don't. If the art style is to detailed and too complex for your liking, there are texture packs out there that could possibly change it all to look like earlier vanilla like sprites, or versely, if you just want consistency there is a mod that makes all the art of vanilla more detailed like cal.
                    eh the only real bullet hell boss is SCal, and the effects are meh, the Radiance mod on the other hand, now ***that's*** a bullet hell with amazing effects, it turns EoL into a fucking brutal fight
                        Tbh radiance feels much more fair, the bullethell is harder and you get oneshot, but you'll probably never feel like you were killed by a projectile you couldn't see, yellow on black makes it very clear what's going on, unlike scal (or yharon) where all projectiles are red, the enemy is red and there also is a heavy red filter makin everything else on screen red, so every moving thing on screen blends into a deep red mush.
                            yeah for sure, SCal is a pain in the ass cuz you can't see the projectiles
                    I will say the art think is subjective, and many mods do a similar thing too in their own way, plus there is a mod to retexture it to fit more with the art direction of cal, so. And touhou-like bosses aren't a bad thing. It's when they poorly designed bullet hails is when problems arise. The visual overload sounds like a device problem than the mod problem though. The vanilla style of boss is a matter of taste, so you have every right to not want to play it for you reasons. But I want to make sure the subjective is not phrased in a way that makes it come off objective. And to make things that ALL mods are guilty come to light. I hate this argument used against Cal when other bigger mods are also guilty of this, not just cal. Plus, who cares if the art style is different? Minecraft mods have done the same. and like Minecraft, terraria has texture pack options, so this isn't a real factor for not playing the mod imo. The way they handle their boss fights and how it effects other mods? Yeah, a more valid reason imo given that unlike artstyles that can be changed with texture packs, this is more skin deep than the latter. 

Also, as a laptop player myself, playing any mods with friends, I having a lot lags the game. Which is why I eventually plan to go PC to handle it.
                        i hate when people blame calamity for not being balanced with other mods when other mods are doing that and dont get blamed, like ancients awakened( which is a worse calamity made by a even more terrible person) has it final boss take 1 damage if youre using weapons that arent AA or vanilla, so for example if youre playing with stars above and u use bury the light on the boss it only deals 1 damage
                            That sucks, yet it seems we are in the minority as evident by my down vote and massive mindless up votes for the comment above. Yeah, most other mods don't even balance that well around vanilla either. A good portion do, but not all. And when you get serious like me and try to call this out or just talk respectful in general, you are: hated, down voted, memed on, rumor spread about you, trashed talked about you behind your back, so much more and become INFAMOUS among the internet like me.

I hate the online and irl to a extent. The world kind of sucks imo.
                May I ask what their vision is? Just deciding if ny playstyle fits
                    The way to fight bosses is as close to no-hit as possible. Bosses tend towards screen filling bullet hells. Everything does absurd amounts of damage. You can get hit a few times, but defense is heavily nerfed, and flying/movement is actively nerfed in many fights. You're heavily rewarded for not getting hit at all in general.

Which you know, is fine! Some people like the pattern-learning style. But I don't like how they force it on people by crowbarring out every mechanic that threatens it or suddenly becomes unbalanced because it's good in their hyper specific world.
                        Thank you I will give it a pass..... I am not the bewt at dodging so what you describe sounds like plain frustration to me.
                            Nothing wrong with that. There are lots of excellent mods out there. It's worth giving it a try, since there is always adjustable difficulty. But I really don't like the design philosophy and have things I enjoy much more.
                Ah sounds exactly DE's intentions with warframe
                Yep, like nerfing basically how the Lava Charm and its other accessories worked in 1.3.? Luckily, you could turn that option off but, Idk if that still happens with 1.4.
                i really dont understand the uproar, the accesory is busted OP and would be even more so in Calamity where movement is even more vital. you want them to intentionally leave it unbalanced or what?
                    Busted OP? I mean, you're allowed to have your opinion! I think that spending a whole accessory slot on movement should give you better movement. And more importantly, is this an uproar? I just gave my opinion.
                        nah, the uproar wasnt yours i just meant people here in general. but it DOUBLES vertical acceleration. I think they did nerf it too much to the point where youre right and its barely worth using which is a bit of a shame though
                Surely you can play without it right? Plus it should be fine since the devs found it necessary for the vision of their creation right?
                    I'm sure I can! I never said it was mandatory for playing or anything. Just that it's fun and the devs hate fun. It's a running theme for Calamity design decisions in my opinion.
            [deleted]
            Yeah, I really dislike the devs tbh. Calamity is absolutely fantastic, but they have made some pretty terrible decisions imo and on more than one occasion have been complete assholes about things when the community complains about it.
                I see it as a case of bad design, amazing execution. I don‚Äôt agree with all their decisions and I like terraria for it‚Äôs flexibility after all
                     I feel like a lot of cal's content can be really bland or bullshitty at times, but you can't deny that the art team has is on point
                        A lot of the art is super good, but doesn‚Äôt fit in terraria at all
                            I mean, Terraria‚Äôs art doesn‚Äôt fit Terraria. The game has such an inconsistent art style - compare the Empress of Light to the Eye of Cthulhu
                                I see it as the game‚Äôs style evolving, even the endgame tools have some level of consistency with the early sprites. On the other hand Calamity feels like art assets for a totally different game, it‚Äôs UI doesn‚Äôt match at all and the tools feel like generic fantasy garbage with weird shapes that make no sense mixed between weapons that would likely kill it‚Äôs own user realistically
                                    Ah true enough. The arts great but if we‚Äôre talking practicality it‚Äôs also very bizarre yeah
                [deleted]
                    No, I didn't even know about anything involving this prior to this thread. When I played/kept up with calamity it was well over a year ago. So stuff prior to that, even lol.
        Calamity players try not to complain about slight changes challenge!!!!

If it‚Äôs that bad, why don‚Äôt you download an infinite flight mod instead of complaining?
            I don't see why you're here to run defense. I just think it's anti-fun design.
            Shockingly, people are allowed to provide feedback on things that they don‚Äôt like. 

That is part of the design process. Get over it.
    cringe
    [deleted]
        Yharon lore no longer does anything, so only Insignia gives infinite flight before cal nerfed it
            Yeah the lore items got their abilities removed because why let the players have fun?
                I mean in hindsight, the lore items were weird and had weird effects for the most part, just a select few had op stuff with them.
                    Plus, they took up tons of inventory space.
                    Well yeah and then probably the reason why shyguymask was able to complete post-ml calamity without movement keys (wasd, other stuff was allowed) was because of the slime god lore item which now does nothing
                Keeping random lore items in your inventory for effects isn‚Äôt ‚Äúfun‚Äù
                    They had effects but the devs removed the effects
                        I know? I‚Äôm saying that those items were a weird concept in the first place.
                            Oops I didnt read the part where you talked about the effects lol
                            Functionally the same as charms in diablo, but yes they did clutter the inventory.
    How did they change it? Is there not infinite flight in calamity already?
        It gives just longer flight time
            Man, doesn't seem worth it when it already seems like players never land anyways.
                Exactly, so why make that problem even worse?
    side note rest in peace short swords.
    i honestly don't think this is that bad, the changes they made to the insignia mean it's still powerful, just not super busted. calamity is one mod where you basically never gain access to infinite flight, i don't think it's an unexpected or unreasonable balance change.
        >the changes they made to the insignia mean it's still powerful

Nah, the changes have made it basically useless because it takes the very precious accessory slot and doesnt combine into anything. Furgermore Calamity accessories are already incredibly busted by themselves; its hard to think about Soaring Insignia as OP when things like The Sponge exist.
            it'd be cool if they could make it combine into something, i wonder if that's in the plans for later on.

calamity accessories become extremely powerful yeah, but you have to remember that The Sponge is really quite lategame, compared to the soaring insignia which in calamity can technically be obtained at the start of hardmode. i also don't think it's out of the ordinary to dedicate an accessory slot to powerful movement boosts. also worth considering that calamity just flat out buffs wings as a whole.
Some things I‚Äôve found over the past few hours that may or may not be helpful to know:

‚Ä¢ Zenith got a tier shift, now requiring Auric Tesla bars to craft 

‚Ä¢ Whips haven‚Äôt been fully added yet, for when they are, tag damage will be multiplicative instead of additive. This mainly affects the Blade Staff and other low damage summons

‚Ä¢ Empress of Light can be fought at the beginning of Hardmode, since Prismatic Lacewings will now start spawning right after WoF

‚Ä¢ Default world size is set to large 

‚Ä¢ The Bestisry is in, seems to be mostly finished
    They should really make Zenith take more swords to craft instead of just requiring bars.
        It'd probably be odd to not see those swords in the swinging animation though
            Yeah and they'd probably be a real pain to try and add
            I don‚Äôt think all the swords are in the original zenith animation. Maybe I just wasn‚Äôt paying attention but I see like 5 different ones.
                They're all there according to the wiki, it can be hard to notice some of them.
        or they nerf it into oblivion and add a "true zenith"
        My guess is that they will. This update was just to make the mod functional in 1.4, not to integrate it fully. The changes listed above are mostly things they can knock out quickly / things that'd be major flaws (for example, zenith would crush every boss before its last few without the tier shift).
    Thanks for the info, that whip change is actually very welcome, I was afraid they were going to make it a melee weapon
        they made a public announcement that regardless of if whips fits there idea of how summoner should be played or not, they would keep whips mostly as they are and add new whips to make it a viable option all troughout a playtrough.

and since they were already adding new "semi-active" weapons for summoners, I'm willing to bet that they do like whips.
    some of these things sound actually really good,but that son of an ass fabsol will nerf basically every vanilla item and accesory to all hell,and especially DR and Defense accesories to please the no hitters
    Thank you, fabsol, for making the blade staff COMPLETELY USELESS.
        Can't they just increase base damage?
            Its low base damage but high hit rate and armor piercing are its entire point. If you were to just buff its damage, you would go against what it's supposed to be.
                A percentage boost would change nothing about the hit rate or armor piercing. What's so bad about buffing the damage to stay at a similar dps? Does the identity matter when it's solely tied to dps.
    How dare they touch my baby the blade staff
    i like the EoL change, reminds me of duke now
Now gonna wait for a mod the reverse the nerf of vanilla stuff
    thats what im doing
        Our only saviour
        How will you name it ? When will it be available ?
            I think they mean they're also waiting
                Bruh, I'm fucking sad rn
                    This dude has unwittingly declared himself the messiah

                    if i get invested enough i could eventually make it but someone will 100% beat me to it
                Goodluck learning C++üíÄ
                    It's C# actually.
                        Tmodloader is in C++, terraria is C# iirc
                            The tModLoader library is C#, and the large majority of the code in tModLoader is C#
    whats nerfed?
         zenith is now post yahron 

And most damage reduction accessories and potions are nerfed
            tbf zenith should be the final melee weapon. i have no idea how they implemented it but i hope it's upgraded with some of the calamity aesthetic/weapons
                [deleted]
                    FFIV rydia, summoners first appeared in FFIII, but you're point still stands lmao
                        Waaaay back when, FFIV used to be called FFII due to the other games not being released in english.
                no, ark of the cosmos should be the final
                    No, ark of the covenant. It gets a bonus if used with Indiana Jones‚Äô whip.
            zenith got insane times for a post-ml weapon on scal. it was on par with post-yharon weapons if not a little worse. though they could've kept it post-ml but nerfed it, and added upgrades to it, but i guess they went the lazy way

idk how to feel about the other changes though
                IIRC, this version was simply designed to come out as quickly as it could, so they took the ‚Äúminimum dev-time‚Äù approach to pretty much everything 1.4-related. We‚Äôll need to wait for a real update to see what their plans are for Zenith and other stuff
            Zenith should be post yharon lol. It's kind of ridiculous even against Scal and exo mechs
        Soaring insignia only gives increased flight time
            bruh...
                Wdym bruh its existence completely destroys the balance of all post moon lord mods including calamity
            Didn't expect anything else. It was the most busted item in 1.4.
    Why would they nerf vanilla from the getgo? To make calamity items more used?
        I think most of Calamity takes place after vanilla end game, so now vanilla endgame was extended in 1.4 to include broken weapons which dont need to be balanced in vanilla because you've already won when you get them, but in Calamity then need to be balanced for the upcoming content.
        Vanilla put in insanely overpowered weapons so because there are no post moonlord bosses and it completely throws off the balance of Calamity. If they didn‚Äôt nerf the vanilla weapons probably about half of the post moonlord content in Calimity would have to be reworked completely
        Nah it's more stupid , it's to make the game harder 

They gave damage reduction a soft cap , but it was so easy to reach with just few accessories and some potions , so to fix it they nerfed the damage reduction of said accessories and potions 

Also many items were nerfed to add a new "stage" to the game , for example I found post plantera weapons to be much weaker than vanilla , which forced me to fight another boss before Golem and the cultist

 ( have to say that the last version of calamity I've played was rust and dust , so my information might be outdated )
            I'm all in favor of an actual stage between plantera and golem though. It was always a letdown beating plantera for the first time, going into the temple, and immediately beating golem easily in vanilla.

Most of the nerfs are because in vanilla, everything after the Moonlord can just be awesome and fun and needs no balancing. In Calamity there's a ton of stuff after Moonlord and the vanilla items in 1.4 completely wreck that without nerfs.
How did they implement whips?
    Its just a port atm so they havent gotten to nerfing / balancing things like whips.
        Didn't they change the whips damage tags from flat damage to % damage to? Meaning that the blade staff is kinda ass now
            they said they would rework it. not sure if they did though
        It's amazing how the first thing you said was "nerfing" and not "adding", that shows how much calamity devs hate fun
            Well, I mean, calamity wasn't made with whips in mind. It's either they nerf whips, nerf summons, or buff literally everything else.

And since there are probably less whips than summons, it makes sense that they would nerf whips.
                A lot of people ITT are really uppity about the concept of anything getting a nerf, even if it has the potential of completely busting the entire game through one class.
                    At the end of the day if you grind enough things or find tricks in Terraria such as building perfect combat arenas and reforging for whatever you need in a fight, you can sort of cheese some bosses. That usually opens doors to progress much faster, and it's normally a part of the game. 

If you use goblin spikes to crush EoW then you get his drops and then it's easier to kill the other start-of-game bosses, for example. Building an arena with teleportation for Plantera underground... etc.

So instead of planned tricks you could use a weapon that is unusually strong early like Scourge of the Corruptor. Or even both the tricks and the weapons. 

But with the nerfs you *must* grind and perfect every arena because at the end of the day, it's more fun to fight when the boss' bullshit is matched or out-matched by the bullshit we build to deal with them. So the end result is... preparation takes more time - you need to grind more. And that's not always fun.
                        I think everything you've said is fair. I even think Calamity is way overtuned on boss difficulty and either the endgame bosses need a nerf or endgame gear needs a buff. I just find a lot of people think nerfing is universally unacceptable, even if it would be both simpler and cleaner to just nerf some things.
                            I agree, sometimes nerfing is the best way about it. 

In this case it's easy to argue against a modder nerfing something that is a part of the base-game though. (why didn't he balance around it like everyone else? why does it even need nerfing when it was accepted in the base game and by other mods? why not just accept that some things may perform better than others instead of nit-picking? and so on)
                                I'd say that, except all of these things in Calamity were made BEFORE the new additions of vanilla 1.4.

So either...

1.  Calamity has to completely re-design it's endgame around the new numbers and potential of base game.

Or

2. Calamity nerfs the numbers/adjust the time of obtaining of a few of the new items.
            Not defending Fabsol, but adding whips in a 1.4 port patch wouldn‚Äôt make sense anyway. iirc other devs promised to add new whips later on so that‚Äôs good
i can‚Äôt wait to play this on journey mode
    Same. Journey mode, master mode difficulty slider. Less grind, the same difficulty.
        don't forget malice mode for extra suffering
            Also masochist mode form fargo's
                then we turn that mob spawnrate *aaaaaaall* the way up!
                Sadly Malice (or death) mode + eternity mode is impossible to complete. This is entirely due to Golem having conflicting mechanics that make him invincible to all damage in phase 2 when both are active. Every other boss is possible to beat with both modes activated. Skeletron Prime is another hard one, since you'll only be able to hit it for 1 damage every single attack, but still theoretically possible.
                    Imagine fucking *GOLEM* ending your challenge playthrough that shit's just so funny to me
                    This is actually possible because you can get the Eidolon Tablet which summons Lunatic Cultist. Eidolists that drop this item, spawn in 3rd layer of Abyss and start appearing after Wall of Flesh has been defeated.
        Or‚Ä¶ hear me out‚Ä¶ Master Mode with 10x spawns.
            And every enemy is a Draedon Mech
                Playing the game the way god intended
                    God? I don't think so, but how that son of a bitch fabsol intended? Definitely 

(Still really salty about everything)
    InB4 Fabsol makes it so you instantly die when opening a Journey world
    oh gods, no. that is a thousand, thousand items to learn!  time to get the "simple research" mod
        Is there any mod which ads a hotkey for research (simple research was unbalanced last time I checked due to lack of crafting table check)
            they might have fixed that, i've had no issue with simple research. just hit one button and everything researchable in yer inventory is gobbled up.  and it also has a research hotkey as well.
            there's a mod that allows you to research the entire inventory at once if available, I can't remember the name though.
    yea gonna do a rev journey mage :)

Watch these mfs nerf journey mode somehow
    There‚Äôs researching support right now, I‚Äôd say it looks like they‚Äôre fine with Journey
        And then they pee their pants and whine when you use a qol mod. Well mostly Fabsol from what I've heard but nobody there has publicly disagreed.
        Journey mode has automatic support with modded items. Just you wait
    [deleted]
        Isn't to low for fabsol from what I've seen
        Trailer shows Journey mode
        The only unresearchable ones are Schematics (supposed to be unique) and like what, Boss Rush drop? And Journey isn‚Äôt nerfed. I hope this doesn‚Äôt change because Fabsol can he like that but things are fine so far
            That's good news, hopefully it stays that way. You're definitely right about him being the type to change it. If Alchemist NPC is cheating to him, journey mode is absolutely cheating.
    [deleted]
        Thankfully there is always cheat sheet and hero's mod to fix that.
            thank god, for not ruining our only way of finishing malice mode king slime
                Is it that bad?
        That isn't new. Even before 1.4 DoG and Providence could deal with cheat sheet's godmode
Rip to every other small content mod
    Why?
        It's a known thing that in the modding community alot of people use smaller content mods alongside calamity , then shit talk about smaller content mods for falling behind and items being too weak
            That's the thing I like the least about Calamity players, they act like it's part of Vanilla Terraria and not a mod, and constantly shit on everyone who doesn't balance things around Calamity, instead of... y'know, Terraria.
                This is why I kind of prefer not using Calamity. The only real loss is the end-game bosses, all the way up to that the other mods are very nice... and Calamity breaks the early-game's balance and vanilla tricks.
                If anything, Thorium should be the mod to balance around.
                    I still don't understand how Calamity is more popular than Thorium. After playing both, I feel like Thorium is the better mod. It integrates with the base game much better.
                        Most popular things rarely are objectively best.
                            Popular things are the those which are advertised the most, like RLCraft from minecraft.
                            Well I wouldn‚Äôt say ‚Äúobjectively best‚Äù, but yeah Thorium is better (even if it doesn‚Äôt the rogue class, but that‚Äôs easily surpassed by techniques).
                        Calamity: MODDED terraria 

Thorium: modded TERRARIA
                    Didn't Thorium used to be like... really bad? or am I thinking of a different one
                        No no, you are thinking of tremor.

Thorium is the golden classic one.
                            You're totally right, I am thinking of Tremor.
                            Oh god, Tremor, I forgot that happened. Thorium is pretty fun though.
                To be fair, they did nerf everything down in their last major update to have things balanced around vanilla (Murasama went from 20000 to 3000 for instance). Their endgame is still more OP than other mod endgames, but it means it's much safer to use Calamity weapons with other mods during certain points of progression.
            Ah okay ty.
        I would assume they mean that a lot of people will just go straight to playing calamity again rather than try other mods, which isnt good for mods without large fanbases. Also calamity is pretty much incompatable with tmod itself lmao.
            Nah did a playthrough while waiting for calamity to update, now gonna do a playthrough of calamity lol,

Really interested in the changes to summoner again, haven't been in the discord
                Happy cake day!
        Calamity is the largest mod
    Try the vitality mod highly recommend
    Lol
    not gonna lie this shit looks rushed as hell i barely see any changes to any of the new vanilla bosses.
        Currently they‚Äôre still working on tons of balance changes to pretty much every aspect of the game, as well as implenting 1.4 features (pylons, whips, etc) to fit with calamity‚Äôs new biomes and further progression. They just released it now so that the community could play it and report bugs and issues to make it an even better experience in the future
            TRUE i was just gonna say its most likely just a port to tml 1.4 rather than new content but still i feel like they could delay it a little to add a bit more content and incentive to play it more. however im not a dev so i wouldn't know
                I don't follow modding stuff so might be wrong but I believe they did a poll asking if people would prefer they delay it until more content is added or release early so people can play with it, and most people voted for early release so that's what they did.
                for people who were still playing 1.3 calamity, this update DOES add new content: 1.4's content
                Dude it‚Äôs free lol
                    just cause its free doesn't mean its good or free from any ounce of criticism
                        Thinking it‚Äôs good is irrelevant. Complaining about the lack of content (if it‚Äôs so good that you want more) is dumb when it‚Äôs free and in the works
        Isn't the main point of the port to get update from Calamity though? As in being able to play existing Calamity mod on 1.4.
        Man, people will complain about anything these days. What do you mean "rushed as hell"? 
 

 Not gonna lie, it kinda sounds like you are used to dealing with actual games getting rushed, like Cyberpunk. 
 
 
Calamity isn't a full game where the devs made a promise, took money, and failed to deliver on that promise and released an unfinished game. This is a mod with a fully playable version that is completely free, and they just happened to give people access to a newer version they are working on.
 
 
And if I come across as a dick here, it's because I really appreciate the crazy amount of work the devs put into Calamity, and it just blows my mind that someone who is able to play it completely free can complain about it like this. It just feels so entitled.
        I mean I would accept a 1.4 version even if it didn't have any major changes
can we talk about how fucking AWESOME THAT TITLE SCREEN IS?
    The Calamity team have some serious talent when it comes to art. From the actual "art" like this titles screen, to the incredible sound track. I really hope they end up working on their own original game some day.
        Well the guy responsible for the incredible soundtrack left because players were sending death threats. So it's unlikely he's ever part of any calamity project ever again.
            Holy shit man, WTF is wrong with people? You'd want to have an extremely empty life to do something like that.
    This is the first time I see it, and I have to say the lettering looks *very* edgy.
        it's been the logo for calamity for like 4 years, back when the mod was trying very hard to be edgy
We just defeated Eater of World on 1.3, I wanna kill myself
    just continue playing it,OR BETTER YET transfer your world from 1.3 to 1.4 because calamity has a issue with world gen at the moment
        What version of calamity has an issue with world gen?
            1.4 calamity, dont worry your 1.3 stuff will remain
                Can you explain to me how to do that or link me something?
                    np chief, to transfer your worlds from 1.3 to 1.4 you need to activate the 1.4 version, Doing that is very simple as you just need to right click the config button on the tmodloader at your library, Then click properties and betas, Then select none to go to 1.4, From there onward you need to click on "transfer worlds" on world creation, Then select your Map and Voila! your world should supposed to be transfered, but if dont, then just continue playing on 1.3 or wait to the devs to fix the 1.4 issue
                        Got it thanks a bunch üôè
                            no problem chief, always happy to help somebody
    we almost defeated Moon Lord on 1.3 and decided to restart now.
Just in time to be outdated by 1.4.4
You should play it with AlchemistNPC
    I‚Äôm *not* a fan or alcNPC with calamity. Somehow alcNPC manages to be overpowered for calamity and breaks progression.

AlcNPC lite, however, I can get behind.
        I second this, AlcNPC is a bit broken but lite is ok. The "infinite mana" thing got me to uninstall it post ML.
        Personally i am not a fan of lite, lite causes all the potions to cost like 90 gold at all times and god forbid you try to buy a modded potion.
    Fabsol screaming rn
    Regular AlchemistNPC, you will probably find a turbo broken ‚Äúlegendary‚Äù weapon that scales with your progression and you will have no reason to use anything else because of how powerful it will be. AlchemistNPC lite is where the fun is at imo
    Don't really need it anymore. Npc's sell potions and it unlocks as you progress
I can finally use the Magic Conch to get to the Abyss, all I ever wanted.
    I remember some other mod that added content to calamity, including a conch that takes you to the sulphuric sea. Finally glad to have that QOL available by default
    inb4 fabsol makes it so that the magic conch only sends you to the regular ocean
        makes sense tho, but also just use The alchemist npc( not the mod name but the npc) beach teleporter, or just walk
        You've given him the idea, now.
I can finally play calamity with big booba goblin tinkerer mod
    Chad + based
    Fuck you

Take an upvote
Alchemist NPC and wing slot? installed

World Difficulty? Set to journey

*aw yeah, it's calamity time*
They nerfed the Zenith didn't they
    made it post-yharon
        best possible choice they could have done tbh. It'd suck to see Zenith doing 3k damage for being such an amazing weapon concept lol.
            From what was shown in a video, it dealt same amount of damage as pre-DoG weapons, but they moved it post-DoG. Apart from its insanely good attack animation, its actually worse than other post-DoG melee weapons damage wise.
                It kinda fucking deletes the exo mechs and Scal so idk.
                    It doesn't delete them, far from it. The dps was similar to a DoG weapon. The main advantage was its animation. It passes through blocks and requires no aiming. So, basically it has 100% uptime.
        [deleted]
            I'd imagine the various accessories and armor you get leading up to Zenith in Calamity would have made it more OP. Base game Zenith was never intended to be balanced after all.
                For people that haven't played Calamity, pretty much every class in the game gets a set of accessories that scale in power as the player progresses w/ new tiers that can be crafted as new materials become available. It's sorta like the power glove line for melee except every class gets something similar. 

Also I'm doubting it, but would the Zenith count as true melee? Because sweet baby jesus that'd be sick w/ all the accessories that buff true melee.
                    I think it would and is then the reason it gets pushed to post Yharon
                    I mean technically speaking it's true melee, you just happen to be chucking the sword at the enemy faster and from further away. You are still *technically* hitting them with the main part of the sword(s). From a gameplay standpoint? No way in hell it would be true melee.
            Litetally shredding exo-mechs and scal.
            it is
            i mean it for a post moon lord weapon that was auric telsa tier of course they would have to make it post yharon other than that some of the other stuff they nerfed was stupid
            prolly made it that op
I‚Äôve heard so much about the recent nerfs on everything and I‚Äôm a bit hesitant to play the new version, as I feel I won‚Äôt be able to have any fun with it- just for a preliminary look, how much have the nerfs messed with the games fun value?
    Non of it is all that impactfull despite so many people whining about it. I think that you should be fine as long as you don't play malice mode
        Okie doki! ü•õ
    Nerfs on items are very needed. In normal terraria they let empress and moon lord give you too many op items because they are the final boss(fair enough), however in modded they have bosses in between or after every normal boss. Having infinite flight and insane flight speed for mediocre wings against bosses that already lower wing flight time is just too op. Or even buffed moonlord items that can kill providence 1.2x faster than the huge crafting tree modded ones is too unfair. They aren‚Äôt nerfing, just balancing.
        I suppose, but I‚Äôve heard about a lot of unnecessary changes that do nothing but ruin a lot of people‚Äôs fun? Idk
    youre kinda forgetting that the mod adds content and doesnt just nerf existing items like most people in this thread, id have thought youd wanna focus on new stuff no?
    Yeah, I played a calamity run on expert mode with my friends like 8 months ago. I'm wondering if it's as hard as people are saying it is now. I thought it was much harder then the base game already though.
        Yeah, it‚Äôs already insanely hard, so I don‚Äôt get why the developers are trying to make it harder? It seemed like one of em cared more about making a hard mod than a fun mod to play- in my experience, If your changes to the game ruin the fun of it, that‚Äôs a pretty bad choice. Fargo‚Äôs is pretty good with this, as you do have to be good at the game to get through bosses, but you feel accomplished doing it instead of just pissed off by the end and wanting it over with- even if the mech bosses are getting to that point with how hard it is to see their tells
    IMO, calamity is the definitive way to play terraria. It does nerf some op stuff, but is also buffs a bunch and has so much qol that should just be in the game. Stuff like non consumable boss summons, early game movement speed and mining speed buff, enemy nerf before a boss is defeated, etc.
        Calamity is a mediocre mod. Zenith should be located Post-Providence, as it deals around that level of DPS. Sure, it obliterates Polterghast, but it would do nothing to the Exo-Mechs or SCal. The content is not actually that high quality, Starlight River will be a content mod of similar size, which DOESN‚ÄôT nerf or move existing items, and will also add super high quality content. The Stars Above isn‚Äôt as big as Calamity, but it is much higher quality and doesn‚Äôt rebalance vanilla. Spirit, Split, Endless Escapade, Ancients Awakened, and many more are way better than Calamity.
            You have no idea what you are talking about. When you use on tier gear and zenith, it destroys exo mechs and SCal. Most of calamity's nerfs and moves are needed as vanilla is kind of broken. The quality of the other mods are completely subjective. Calamity may not have the best visuals out there, but they're not bad. Plus, the fights and difficulty is great.
Oh my god its been forever since ive played calamity this is exactly what i needed!!!!
Isn‚Äôt this the mod that got it‚Äôs Dev leaving one month ago and seemed like an ahole ?
    No, the dev didn't leave, he just spammed the subreddit with a bunch of sockpuppets, and the owner of the subreddit shut it down "for the good of the community" because he didn't want to run the subreddit anymore
Why is everybody in this comment section so hateful
    misinformation and general redditor stuff
Fear
Dude I thought the siege devs were awful but Calamity now just looks like a husk of it's former self.

        Continuously they make baffling changes, harass their users and add complicated garbage, all while slowly wringing fun out of the old good content.
            The problem is that fabsol has a specific vision for how he wants his mod to be played and nobody is allowed to disagree, but a majority of players don't agree with how fabsol wants the mod to be played.
                Fabsol uses she/her pronouns.
            I don‚Äôt have much of an issue with where the mod is rn, I think it‚Äôs fun.

Fabsiol can fuck right off though
            the fuck are you talking about?? define complicated garbage
    Starbound frackin devs seem similar too
        Fuck... I didn't need to be reminded lol
Can't wait to see if it works with Journey mode.
    it does
Great, it's not like I was balls deep in a 1.3 playthrough just like 2 days before this.
    Apparently you can transfer 1.3 worlds to 1.4 or sumn, thats what I read in a comment
oh boy cant wait for the replies of this post to be filled with people harassing people who like calamity and the devs

edit: wait no i was being sarcastic
    What if I like calamity but hate the devs

    "NOO YOU CANT ENJOY CALAMITY SPLIT IS A FAR SUPERIOR MOD AND ALSO SPIRIT AND THORIUM AND YOURE A SWEATY PLAYER!!!!" 

"hehe, Jetstream sam character go brrrrrrrrrrrrr"
        i just like killing gods and the abyss and stuff
            I just like it's support with the Stars Above mod

tl;dr i like killing gods with weapons obtained from killing gods. And star godess but that's beside the point
                I too like the star waifus
                Playing Calamity can be really stressful, and having a cute star lady occasionally show up to tell me that I'm doing great really helps alleviate that.
        MEMORIES BROKEN INTENSIFIES (I hear boss music \m/)
    i'm honestly trying to figure out why this community became so negative and bitter about calamity as of late. i know a lot of people don't agree with the changes from vanilla and some of the nerfs that have been happening, that's fine. 

but i missed the point where everyone started bashing the devs for what are essentially preferential gameplay changes. i don't really feel we should be bashing mod devs for their gameplay vision, doesn't really matter if it's a big mod or a small mod.

mini rant, probably won't go over well, but the modded terraria community has disappointed me on all sides as of late. at some point we need to realize that this cycle of negativity is helping literally nobody
        I think its mostly due to misinformation about fabsol and the devs


Yea fabsol can be kind of a dick but i dont think he even uses reddit and also not all of the devs act like fabsol
        I never got the hate with calamity being balanced around itself when Ancients awakened dragon superboss takes 1 damage from every weapon that isnt AA or vanilla
            Calamity balancing the rest of the game around itself kills its compatibility with basically every other mod that doesnt specifically allow for clamity compatability.
                yes but AA just did that but worse, with the superboss basically forcing you to use AA weapons only
                    I never said that aa wasnt bad
            i think a lot people use calamity's vast popularity as an excuse to quite frankly be assholes about it, for lack of better word.
                Ye, its kinda people being mad at people who like charizard from pokemon despite it being overrated, like The Big mac has a place in the table for a reason, plus its not like Calamity being installed makes you unable to play other mods
        People complaining that those making free content aren't making the free content exactly the way they want. 

Newsflash: calamity isn't a democracy or a publicly traded company who answers to anyone. They make the mod they want to make. If you don't like it or don't like the developers, then don't play it and don't support it. Make your own mod instead, and when it's inevitably crap, and you have a bunch of mouth breathers whining about every decision you make, you'll might emphasize.
            Here before you get called an alt lmao
                Probably, don't work on calamity or Terraria mods, but I am a game developer myself. I can't imagine working for free, for a bunch of freeloaders to whine and whinge about every decision I make. I'd tell them to go fuck themselves, too.
                    yep, this is pretty much exactly how i feel on the matter. i sympathize with the devs and i hope this recent wave of needless toxicity isn't affecting them too heavily.

this is a great mod, no i don't necessarily agree with the way it does some things, but there are always better ways to discuss these things. raging and bashing won't convince the devs, if anything it'll probably do the opposite. that's how passion projects work

        Fab has twitter?
        i get not liking fab he can be kind of a dick sometimes but jesus calm down
            i dont think he even has a twitter god damn people on reddit will believe literally anything you tell them at face value if it allows them to circlejerk
    in all serious though even if this isnt a big update its gonna be fun to eventually play a journey rev mage playthrough and use stuff like block replacements so my dome houses can be those furniture sets that are too late in the game for house building
        Mage is so fun, you're so ridiculously powerful yet you're made of essentially glass
            hell yea who doesnt love a good ol glass cannon
    Have you forgotten? We are on reddit, home to the worst of the worst in the mod community, sanity sadly barely exists here
"Calamity is a bad mod, its balanced around itself and as such its bad"

"Calamity developer is such a ass amiright haha...."

"Why are you playing trash calamity go play split and spirit instead of Playing trash nohit mod"

"QUIT HAVING FUN"

how yall mfs be looking rn
YOOOOOOOO
rip all other small mods

Also, for all things calamity, go visit the new r/calamitymod_ and further our dream towards the original 50k members!
    Uhuh
    Why rip to smaller mods? It‚Äôs not like they just lost something they ever had to begin with??
        Well because smaller mods were easier to port over/ easier to create with the new update, it made it so those were the first mods available for 1.4. People wanted to play 1.4 modded but didn't have access to older mods, so it allowed people to branch out in ways they maybe wouldn't if major mods were still available. So now that more major mods are started to get ported, there's gonna be a drop in people checking out smaller mods.
        But now everyone who was making do with the smaller mods and enjoying them while calamity was being ported now get shoved from the limelight they have had eluded from them for so long
    Why not r/calamitymod?
        [deleted]
            I wanna know more about this, do you have any sources I can read/watch?

                He kinda made a bunch of alts to defend himself with on that sub specifically soo... he kinda did have something to do on there. He also constantly told people they should play a certain kind of way (without nurse exploit, without the alchemy mod etc.) and called people trash if they didn't play the mod as he intended.

edit: r/calamitymod_ even has a rule saying that telling others to "get good" is a bannable offense so yea. I think that might be referring to his actions.

edit: apparently the get good rule wasn't inspired by our favorite toxic dev, and the alts were of some other salty kid. Sry for that, other stuff is accurate thou
                    as a mod of the new subreddit, fabsol had nothing to do with the original subreddit, the alts were made by some toxic kid and we were sent proof of it. the get good rule is unrelated
                        Dang. Oh well, thx for clarification and sorry for misinformation.
                            U should add another edit on your original comment saying it‚Äôs untrue if you‚Äôre really sorry :v
                                People don't really care about what the truth is, they just like to have excuses to blame people they don't like :)
                                    Jeez bro I edited already sheesh
                                    no fucking way your getting downvoted for this reply

that's a nice argument, Senator, why don't you back it up with a source?
                        It happened, trust me.

[...like, unironically.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CalamityMod/comments/v59ub6/fabsol_trying_to_not_be_a_jerk_challenge/) Here's the [image](https://i.redd.it/olxg1vuyur391.jpg) the post came with.
                            Although there is proof of him being a jackass there is none of him using alts.
                                Multiple accounts a few days old defending him? (as in the ONLY accounts defending him?) If this isn't enough proof for you, you're experiencing mental disociation.
                                    Weird you wanna say im disassociating because there is no proof. You are almost as toxic as he is in those screenshots. If you think alts repeating what he said verbatim is proof or evidence I would recommend that you not be any profession like a police officer or lawyer. Would not make a great fit. If you have any way to link it back to him and not trolls or people just trying to stir the pot or add fuel to the fire be my guest and I will eat my words.

                all i wanted to do was correct misinformation damn didnt even say i liked fabsol really

its disappointing to see a subreddit for one of my favorite games act like this
                [deleted]
Do none of you have the slightest idea of balancing? If you want terrible balancing with insanely op accessories just install shity op mods.
Oh. My. God.
    What have I done to have brought the wrath of redditors upon myself? I've been waiting for clamity to release to 1.4 to play with friends and enjoy all the new content from vanilla and modded combined!!
        because fuck you in particular, apparently
        reddit moment
        Calamity multiplayer lol.
Never truly played through calamity before, gonna try it now since summoner is way better in 1.4
    Ha. You poor thing
        Isnt summoner already op in calamity? the "nerfs" to the whips are still a power increase to an already strong class
fabsol is going to throw a shitfit about how 1.4 ruins the balance of the game and is cheating
    more like the community imploding because people are having fun playing one of the best mods
Mid af mod
    The mod itself is good. The devs, though, are awful.
    Based
    That's about where I'm at.
Huzza
OH SHIT
Bro imma need to see then changeless because this lock screen is sick af
Finally it is time.
Are whips viable, though
Well, time to download tmodloader when i get home! Looking forward to playing calamity for the first time!
Came in here, saw mostly rage and hate on Calamity and the dev team.

Goodness, if you dislike it all that much, why do you even play it? Why do you decide to shit on the devs, and Fabsol in particular, so much? Do you even play the mod, or look at the changelogs that're posted? The reasons for the changes?

Do you realize it's not all made by one single person, and is instead a collective group effort?
    fabsol can be kind of a dick but he's not like a genuinely horrible person like people here would make you believe afaik

&#x200B;

and the other devs seem really cool from what i've seen in discord
        Thing is, I know that. I've been a patron of the mod since 2019. It hurts seeing the names of these people I know get trashed for behavior that they really don't exhibit.
            yea sadly thats reddit for yea
For some unknown reason, never decided to run any mod under outdated base game. By reason and logic, sounds stupid, sure, but just dunno, the way for personal me.

No more.
Let me guess, they nerfed all the new vanilla items stuff like the Soaring thingy, Zenith, and other items

They somehow made Journey mode suck

And other things im too lazy to mention
    https://calamitymod.wiki.gg/wiki/2.0.0.001
Yey!
Lezzgooooooo
man i love tmodloader 1.4 running horribly
Finally!
there should be an option to toggle the nerfs on or off
*cries in GOG terraria*
    The GOG version can use tModLoader (and thus the mod browser) just fine. Download it from the official Terraria forums (the way it was done before the Steam version) and you're good to go.
        but I thought they'll stop updating the forum link?
Hell yeah!
Too bad that the mod is shit now and everything was nerfed to hell

Also cool title screen
    Try actually playing it
    Have you ever considered that it was balanced to work around new vanilla content that is usually overpowered for the tier it‚Äôs at because normally it would be the end of the game, but only 2/3 in the mod?
        It was like that in 1.3 as well
Bad mod, good music
I wish it was on console
If there was ever a time for me to do my first summoner playthrough...
Oh god, its happening, everybody stay calm
Let's fucking go
Bruh I just downloaded the game lmao
Oh god and I just completed one of my calamity runs... I need a break
I started my 1.3 massive mod pack like 2 days before 1.4 tml was released I want to end it all rn I just beat moon lord
    Can't you import characters and worlds?
HOLY FUCKING FRUIT BASKET. This looks lit!
holy shit its finally here?? this looks sick!
Woahh
Now if only my monitor worked
YUSSSSSSS
I wonder what they nerfed this time?

Seriously though this is exciting, the no fun allowed nerfs don't bother me because there will be a mod that reverts them eventually.
Let's go, now we can do Master Malice Mode Hardcore For The Worthy!
What are the major updates cause knowing the devs they nerves every fun and cool item a update after they come out
wow, people in the comments seem really sour about calamity's various nerfs, modifications, and style. this is amazing that they've managed to port to 1.4 so quickly, and thanks again fabsol and team for giving us hours upon hours of entertainment for free (beyond the initial cost of terraria, which they didn't benefit from)
    People are allowed to not like things. Just like you're allowed to like things. Enjoy playing Calamity, no one can or should tell you not to. But you also can't tell people they have to like what you like.
        he did not once say they werent allowed to dislike the mod, literally just making an observation
    its so fucked up how this wholesome-ass comment is downvoted.
        ye the dude dao apparently has a hateboner, but apparently Fabsol is the big bad guys he doesnt let us use qol mods even tho i can play just fine with alchemist npc lite and Luiafk
[mfw calamity:](https://youtu.be/sAXZbfLzJUg)
wooo i sure do hate when modders spend countless hours of free labor for the community, better go insult them and the product at every point it's mentioned.  
i get that a single calamity modder hates qol mods, i get that he didnt say the nicest things on discord about people who use them, and i simply do not care. im sure if someone looked at u guys' discord messages they would not find exclusively beacons of sunshine.  
imma go play the fun mod that triples the games content while ppl cope and seathe, plus use whatever qol mods i want bc i dont care what some dude ill never meet said in a discord server ill never join.
    I fucking love playing with Calamity. The only thing that really ruffles my jimmys is that he took away my teleports during bossfights. Maybe a little exploity, but he seems to care about "playing the right way" a bit too much
    Based
    triples the games content with enemy ai that makes a slime look like the final boss and unoriginal weapons and designs that don‚Äôt even fit the gameüíÄ go play Fargos
        Fargos also doesn't fit the game lol
            Fargo reworks all bosses and makes them challenging yet an actually fun experience rather than a bullet sponge + high damage, sure the forces and shit are strange (yet cool, you can literally stop time) but other than that it‚Äôs a super vanilla mod
        just use the texture pack, 1.4 has a support for texture packs and its far more easier to do now
    You're allowed to have your opinion, but you seem to think other people aren't allowed to have theirs. That's what makes you an asshole, not liking Calamity.
        There's a difference between having an opinion and being an asshole who has to shout it from the rooftops at every available opportunity. When a new Justin Beiber song releases, do I go to that community to tell them it's shit? When a YouTuber I don't like uploads a new video, am I there ASAP to post that they're fat/ugly and their video sucks? Do I ask everyone who buys an iPhone why they're okay being treated like a child in regard to how they're allowed to use it after spending $1000? Do I walk into people's houses and tell them their house looks like it was furnished/decorated by a broke, blind 95-year-old?

No because it's none of my business. I didn't pay money for any of these things, and nobody gives a rat's ass about my opinion, no matter how factually correct I may consider my opinion to be. If you go out of your way to spew negativity for something that you didn't pay for and doesn't concern you, then you are in fact an asshole.
Will old progress be transferable?
    Yes. But the Devs can't guarantee anything. Check the discord for more info
It doesnt let me play 1.4 tmodloader
Can anyone help me i can't run it
I like how everyone's all, "FUCK YOU CALAMITY AND ITS DEVS ARE GREAT," and, "NO, FUCK YOU, CALAMITY AND ITS MODS ARE SHIT," and I'm over here like, "Looks nice. But it's evidently bullet hell and I don't like bullet hell, so I might pass."
    There is only 1 boss that my brain can register is bullet hell right now just to let ya know
        theres definitely more, both Calamitas fights, a Provi attack, a Yharon attack and now Rev+ EOL ig
Did they add the damn final boss yet also WHY does the damn jungle dragon sprite still look terrible üíÄ great news tho thanks for sharing
OH.

OH FUCK.
Guess stars above will have to wait.
    Why not both?
        I've been playing with Stars Above and Calamity in 1.3, they work pretty well together and Stars Above even makes commentary on Calamity stuff.
        They don't seem to be working alongside at this moment. Tried to load them, only 1 works at a time.
        Calamity is too bloated to run with other mods.
            I tried running it with thorium, the 32-bit memory limit meant I ran out of memory often. Tmod has never been as unstable as it was then. I picked calamity over thorium
                why you playing calamity with thorium tho, Like these two are like mentos and cocacola, never be put together
                    I had read somewhere that the special ocean of biome of thorium was chosen on the opposite side of the abyss specifically to let it be used with calamity. I also saw a video where someone was playing both together. I don't know much about thorium, but it didn't grab me like calamity did.
                        yeah but like thorium is severely underpowered compared to calamity, if you want a mod that goes well with calamity play the stars above
Feel like people don't deserve this after all the complaining.
    ???
    omg i know right, i guess people have a huge hateboner for basically a free dlc
but.. why? Most of the bosses already dissable infinite flight?
    >Most of the bosses already dissable infinite flight

what, why? that sounds dumb
        yeah, it is
            calamity devs hate fun in general
                you don‚Äôt enjoy dozens of bullet bell boss fights with .1%  chance of dropping the item you want that becomes completely useless once you beat the next boss?
                    wait till calamity loot swap comes in, or Better yet just get alchemist npc Operator and a shitton of platinum and buy the bags
                        Calamity devs on their way to make the mod uncompatible with Alchemist NPC and many other QoL mods
                            Bam, re compatibility patch specifically that requires calamity and alchemist  or whatever mod so MAKE it compatible again.
                            dont give them ideias
                    The 1% drops get stronger the further you get into the game so the weapons don‚Äôt fall off too fast.
                        That's *ooooooold* Calamity, man. Legendary drops haven't scaled in *YEARS*.
                            Wait so halibut cannon used to get better, does it not now?
                                Halibut still does. All the other old legendaries like Aegis Blade, Blossom Flux, etc. don't anymore (and in my opinion, they're in the least creative and most unrewarding state they've ever been in).
                They pander to try hards and masochists, have you seen the levels in difficulty they added
                    brother if you think a higher level of difficulty thats basically a way superior master mode without being simply damage buffs to enemies means its for masochist then look at master mode for the worthy hardcore no wasd copper shortsword only
                Calamity devs had a very different idea of fun a few years ago. Maybe Dokuro stepping down messed with Drew in some way, but the mod took a huge turn for the lame in the past few updates.
                [removed]
                    [removed]
                yeah thats why there are countless QOL changes that make the game more fun then i spose
                Not every mod is tailored to your play style. Making dumbass statements like that reflects poorly on yourself, I'd recommend avoiding that in the future.
                    Chill brother, I like playing Calamity but it's undeniable that the devs make some questionable decisions regarding fun. Don't know why you got all offended about it though. You don't need to be so protective of a terraria mod lmao.
                        Not every mod is tailored to your play style. Making dumbass statements like that reflects poorly on yourself, I'd recommend avoiding that in the future.
                Don‚Äôt play it then
                    Is this a Fabsol alt?
                    not happ'n'n
    theres very few bosses that do this and its not even a big deal
        exactly, there's no reason to nerf Soaring Insignia
            The primary effect of it isnt even the infinite flight, its the DOUBLED vertical acceleration which is mad. Infinite flight is pretty good but if youre good with your hook its not a game changer but pretty good, to be fair the item was over-nerfed but it was busted before with the unopposed flight mobility.
Thankfully there's a mod that combines it with the terra boots , so we still can use it without the nerf
    First time I heard someone talk about my mod, that's pretty neat

I'll have to try if it actually works with the calamity nerfs because if calamity overrides the correct thing it would also affect my boots
        Doing God's work bro üôè
        Not really, if you set up the new accessory with weird loopholes like +9999 flight time instead of flightTime = max (i haven't worked with flight time so excuse my ignorance if this is wrong)
            I don't use flight time at all, there is a parameter called empressBrooch that I just set to true.But Calamity overrides that exact parameter so I'll just set flight time to max or a really high value with a config if someone likes the calamity nerf
                Ah that would make sense. I think you could just have the accessory have that max time you're talking about, since the rocket boots add to the flight time of wings, so it makes sense for other accessories to increase the flight time as eell
        What is your mod
    ngl, that mod is probably the only way the Soaring Insignia would be worthwhile when using a large mod like Calamity.  No matter how useful it is, an accessory with one and a half really good effects pales in comparison to an accessory with a handful of good effects with how limited accessory slots are.
        antisocial is so good if you wanna have more accesory slots, but you might think its cheaty
    Can I get the name of the mod, pretty please?
        https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2564474517
            Ty mate.
    I would also like to request the mods name if you'd be so kind
        https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2564474517
    Also Fargo and Stars Above aka the big anti-Fabsol shield.
    Just wanted to tell that there is now a config where you can decide if you want the nerf to apply for the boots as well or not (The default value is to ignore the nerf and grant infinite flight anyways)
    Mod name please
        https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2564474517
    yeah that seems balanced
Well of course they do, Calamity devs hate fun.
    Not fun, just fun that differs from their own ideas. No one is allowed to use QOL mods, the nurse, nothing that changes fabsol's idea of how his mod should be played.
        Damn, I feel the stuck-upness through the screen, ESPECIALLY from a guy, whose half of ideas consists of stealing everything possible from MGR:R (one-off references are okay, but when your most powerful weapon is directly from that game without name changes, and you incorporate the absolutely not fitting health UI into Terraria, then it gets kinda suspect) and spongify vanilla bosses for "challenge"
            Fabsol seems like he's trying to take Calamity in two different directions at the same time. All of the MGR references are fun nods to (presumably) fab's favorite game, which he's totally allowed to do. It's literally his mod, after all. However, at the same time, he's trying to turn "Terraria" into "Calamity." The Health UI and boss AI changes definitely make it feel like Calamity is designed as its own experience, and while that's also totally okay, the way that "mod with a bunch of references made for fun" and "mod that's designed to overhaul your entire play experience" mix in Calamity is not done well. I personally love Calamity. I always have, and I play the shit out of it whenever I can, but it's definitely got its problems.
        well i play with ore excavator, Alchemist, overhaul, ther content mods and Luiafk 

mainly because i suck at the game without these but that doesn‚Äôt matter
        [deleted]
            They don't. QoL mods are unaffected, the nurse is disabled when a boss is alive solely when playing in Death mode, etc.
            they dont
            They don't.
        dude nothing is stoping you from playing without those, alchemist npc is still usable and so is ore excavator
        What's he gonna do about it?
            Nerf a bunch of things people found fun.
                he does that anyways
    Its not that bad is it?
        Calamity? Calamity is fine. Some well made, interesting content. But the devs hate any alternate way of playing the game other than their very firm vision and will work in nerfs to alternate playstyles. Hard. Hence soaring insignia being heavily nerfed.
            This whole Calamity thing reminds me of Gregtech drama from Minecraft's FeedtheBeast (FtB) mod packs way back in the day. 


Sorry for the long post.
TLDR; Greg liked Grind=Power and applied it to a ton popular mods in modpacks that included his Gregtech mod. Players didn't like having to spend a lot of time to get simple automation. Mod Creators had their own vision for their mod and didn't like him messing with it. It caused a lot of drama.


And now the post:
For those that don't know FtB mod packs were a bundle of minecraft mods that usually focused on factory building and industrialization. Think Factorio before Factorio existed.


One of the mods included was called Gregtech which was a mid-endgame expansion to the very popular Industrialcraft 2 mod.  Greg was the mod creator and had a mindset of working hard to earn powerful rewards. If you got to endgame with this mod it delivered on this vision with some ludicrously strong production, storage, sorting, and power generation.


The problem came in with the fact that Greg thought this mindset should be applied to all mods in a mod pack that included Gregtech and a lot of the popular modpacks had Gregtech included. Greg would adjust the recipes of machines from other mods to make them significantly more time consuming and expensive. For example a simple flint and steel went from 1 flint and 1 iron ingot to 1 flint and 1 steel ingot. A steel ingot required a few different machines to produce as opposed to iron only needing a furnace.


This irked a lot of players and mod creators. A good chunk of players didn't like the added grind to everything and the factory building part of the mod pack took significantly longer to both get to and build.  Mod creators were quite annoyed since they had their own vision of how their progression in their mod worked and communication with Greg was apparently frustrating.


Eventually the outcry got loud enough that the modpack creators split packs into a version that included Gregtech and one that didnt. Also mod creators were creating their own recipie "packs" that you could swap to in the config file and usually included a "Vanilla" version. Not entirely sure what happened after the split as shortly after that I stopped playing FtB for a while.
                Good explanation. However, instead of explaining all this you can just tell to anyone curious to play GT NH (GregTech: New Horizons) and it will be self-explanatory
                    Thank you! This Calamity drama just kinda dug out a memory from like 9 years ago. I haven't played as much FtB or FtB styled modpacks in recent years and don't really know what Gregtech New Horizons is, but given who he is my guess is that it is months worth of grind with increasingly complex systems that end in you becoming some kind of industrial god.
                        Cool to see someone who was around back then in the wild! I still remember playing RedPower and looking at the movable frames - it was like Create, years before Create
                            Yea man it was some good times. My friend group had a whole server running with the Ultimate pack and we had some fun coming up with factories that combined multiple mods into an amalgam of industry.
                                I loved that. Have you played modded Minecraft recently? Create: Above and Beyond was a great modpack (although endgame was kind of too math-ey for me)
                I haven't heard about calamities developers much but the sentiment here reminds me of Starbounds Frackin Universe dev and similar criticisms going towards him. He literally made an update to his mod that detected another mod that reverted a nerf he made to a certain planet type(making them useless to visit). In the code he made a line called ''Idiot Check'' which checks if people are using the mod, and essentially causes every weather effect to happen at the same time and kill the player.  He's had a history of doing other things in that ballpark but holy moly that was ridiculous.
            It's funny. As soon as I encountered the insignia when 1.4 came out my first thought regarding modded was "oh yeah, calamity is gonna make this useless"
            That, plus the artstyle/UI clashes (just some of the artstyle doesn't fit terraria at all), most bosses being either the souped-up versions of vanilla bosses or touhou-like bullet hells, and visual effect overload that only plummets performance on my laptop are the reasons why I didn't wind up playing Calamity
                THIS this right here. It's the attempts at re-writing the lore that get me the worst, the art looks like it belongs in Starbound instead of Terraria, and everything that the devs have written reads like something a 13 year old AOL roleplayer from the 90s wrote.
                    At this point calamity feels like a diffrent game so I dont see a point complaining about it having a diffrent art style or weird lore.
                    You mean, re-writting terraria's official, OPTIONAL, lore that's very basic and mediocre at best? Yeah, the lore is bad, but it's getting fixed to be better written, so this could all change. Terraria also got more and more detailed art style, see EoL. The art style is a matter of TASTES my dude. There are texture packs for a reason, and mods shouldn't be forced to cater to one artstyle as many mods don't. If the art style is to detailed and too complex for your liking, there are texture packs out there that could possibly change it all to look like earlier vanilla like sprites, or versely, if you just want consistency there is a mod that makes all the art of vanilla more detailed like cal.
                eh the only real bullet hell boss is SCal, and the effects are meh, the Radiance mod on the other hand, now ***that's*** a bullet hell with amazing effects, it turns EoL into a fucking brutal fight
                    Tbh radiance feels much more fair, the bullethell is harder and you get oneshot, but you'll probably never feel like you were killed by a projectile you couldn't see, yellow on black makes it very clear what's going on, unlike scal (or yharon) where all projectiles are red, the enemy is red and there also is a heavy red filter makin everything else on screen red, so every moving thing on screen blends into a deep red mush.
                        yeah for sure, SCal is a pain in the ass cuz you can't see the projectiles
                I will say the art think is subjective, and many mods do a similar thing too in their own way, plus there is a mod to retexture it to fit more with the art direction of cal, so. And touhou-like bosses aren't a bad thing. It's when they poorly designed bullet hails is when problems arise. The visual overload sounds like a device problem than the mod problem though. The vanilla style of boss is a matter of taste, so you have every right to not want to play it for you reasons. But I want to make sure the subjective is not phrased in a way that makes it come off objective. And to make things that ALL mods are guilty come to light. I hate this argument used against Cal when other bigger mods are also guilty of this, not just cal. Plus, who cares if the art style is different? Minecraft mods have done the same. and like Minecraft, terraria has texture pack options, so this isn't a real factor for not playing the mod imo. The way they handle their boss fights and how it effects other mods? Yeah, a more valid reason imo given that unlike artstyles that can be changed with texture packs, this is more skin deep than the latter. 

Also, as a laptop player myself, playing any mods with friends, I having a lot lags the game. Which is why I eventually plan to go PC to handle it.
                    i hate when people blame calamity for not being balanced with other mods when other mods are doing that and dont get blamed, like ancients awakened( which is a worse calamity made by a even more terrible person) has it final boss take 1 damage if youre using weapons that arent AA or vanilla, so for example if youre playing with stars above and u use bury the light on the boss it only deals 1 damage
                        That sucks, yet it seems we are in the minority as evident by my down vote and massive mindless up votes for the comment above. Yeah, most other mods don't even balance that well around vanilla either. A good portion do, but not all. And when you get serious like me and try to call this out or just talk respectful in general, you are: hated, down voted, memed on, rumor spread about you, trashed talked about you behind your back, so much more and become INFAMOUS among the internet like me.

I hate the online and irl to a extent. The world kind of sucks imo.
            May I ask what their vision is? Just deciding if ny playstyle fits
                The way to fight bosses is as close to no-hit as possible. Bosses tend towards screen filling bullet hells. Everything does absurd amounts of damage. You can get hit a few times, but defense is heavily nerfed, and flying/movement is actively nerfed in many fights. You're heavily rewarded for not getting hit at all in general.

Which you know, is fine! Some people like the pattern-learning style. But I don't like how they force it on people by crowbarring out every mechanic that threatens it or suddenly becomes unbalanced because it's good in their hyper specific world.
                    Thank you I will give it a pass..... I am not the bewt at dodging so what you describe sounds like plain frustration to me.
                        Nothing wrong with that. There are lots of excellent mods out there. It's worth giving it a try, since there is always adjustable difficulty. But I really don't like the design philosophy and have things I enjoy much more.
            Ah sounds exactly DE's intentions with warframe
            Yep, like nerfing basically how the Lava Charm and its other accessories worked in 1.3.? Luckily, you could turn that option off but, Idk if that still happens with 1.4.
            i really dont understand the uproar, the accesory is busted OP and would be even more so in Calamity where movement is even more vital. you want them to intentionally leave it unbalanced or what?
                Busted OP? I mean, you're allowed to have your opinion! I think that spending a whole accessory slot on movement should give you better movement. And more importantly, is this an uproar? I just gave my opinion.
                    nah, the uproar wasnt yours i just meant people here in general. but it DOUBLES vertical acceleration. I think they did nerf it too much to the point where youre right and its barely worth using which is a bit of a shame though
            Surely you can play without it right? Plus it should be fine since the devs found it necessary for the vision of their creation right?
                I'm sure I can! I never said it was mandatory for playing or anything. Just that it's fun and the devs hate fun. It's a running theme for Calamity design decisions in my opinion.
        [deleted]
        Yeah, I really dislike the devs tbh. Calamity is absolutely fantastic, but they have made some pretty terrible decisions imo and on more than one occasion have been complete assholes about things when the community complains about it.
            I see it as a case of bad design, amazing execution. I don‚Äôt agree with all their decisions and I like terraria for it‚Äôs flexibility after all
                 I feel like a lot of cal's content can be really bland or bullshitty at times, but you can't deny that the art team has is on point
                    A lot of the art is super good, but doesn‚Äôt fit in terraria at all
                        I mean, Terraria‚Äôs art doesn‚Äôt fit Terraria. The game has such an inconsistent art style - compare the Empress of Light to the Eye of Cthulhu
                            I see it as the game‚Äôs style evolving, even the endgame tools have some level of consistency with the early sprites. On the other hand Calamity feels like art assets for a totally different game, it‚Äôs UI doesn‚Äôt match at all and the tools feel like generic fantasy garbage with weird shapes that make no sense mixed between weapons that would likely kill it‚Äôs own user realistically
                                Ah true enough. The arts great but if we‚Äôre talking practicality it‚Äôs also very bizarre yeah
            [deleted]
                No, I didn't even know about anything involving this prior to this thread. When I played/kept up with calamity it was well over a year ago. So stuff prior to that, even lol.
    Calamity players try not to complain about slight changes challenge!!!!

If it‚Äôs that bad, why don‚Äôt you download an infinite flight mod instead of complaining?
        I don't see why you're here to run defense. I just think it's anti-fun design.
        Shockingly, people are allowed to provide feedback on things that they don‚Äôt like. 

That is part of the design process. Get over it.
cringe
[deleted]
    Yharon lore no longer does anything, so only Insignia gives infinite flight before cal nerfed it
        Yeah the lore items got their abilities removed because why let the players have fun?
            I mean in hindsight, the lore items were weird and had weird effects for the most part, just a select few had op stuff with them.
                Plus, they took up tons of inventory space.
                Well yeah and then probably the reason why shyguymask was able to complete post-ml calamity without movement keys (wasd, other stuff was allowed) was because of the slime god lore item which now does nothing
            Keeping random lore items in your inventory for effects isn‚Äôt ‚Äúfun‚Äù
                They had effects but the devs removed the effects
                    I know? I‚Äôm saying that those items were a weird concept in the first place.
                        Oops I didnt read the part where you talked about the effects lol
                        Functionally the same as charms in diablo, but yes they did clutter the inventory.
How did they change it? Is there not infinite flight in calamity already?
    It gives just longer flight time
        Man, doesn't seem worth it when it already seems like players never land anyways.
            Exactly, so why make that problem even worse?
side note rest in peace short swords.
i honestly don't think this is that bad, the changes they made to the insignia mean it's still powerful, just not super busted. calamity is one mod where you basically never gain access to infinite flight, i don't think it's an unexpected or unreasonable balance change.
    >the changes they made to the insignia mean it's still powerful

Nah, the changes have made it basically useless because it takes the very precious accessory slot and doesnt combine into anything. Furgermore Calamity accessories are already incredibly busted by themselves; its hard to think about Soaring Insignia as OP when things like The Sponge exist.
        it'd be cool if they could make it combine into something, i wonder if that's in the plans for later on.

calamity accessories become extremely powerful yeah, but you have to remember that The Sponge is really quite lategame, compared to the soaring insignia which in calamity can technically be obtained at the start of hardmode. i also don't think it's out of the ordinary to dedicate an accessory slot to powerful movement boosts. also worth considering that calamity just flat out buffs wings as a whole.
They should really make Zenith take more swords to craft instead of just requiring bars.
    It'd probably be odd to not see those swords in the swinging animation though
        Yeah and they'd probably be a real pain to try and add
        I don‚Äôt think all the swords are in the original zenith animation. Maybe I just wasn‚Äôt paying attention but I see like 5 different ones.
            They're all there according to the wiki, it can be hard to notice some of them.
    or they nerf it into oblivion and add a "true zenith"
    My guess is that they will. This update was just to make the mod functional in 1.4, not to integrate it fully. The changes listed above are mostly things they can knock out quickly / things that'd be major flaws (for example, zenith would crush every boss before its last few without the tier shift).
Thanks for the info, that whip change is actually very welcome, I was afraid they were going to make it a melee weapon
    they made a public announcement that regardless of if whips fits there idea of how summoner should be played or not, they would keep whips mostly as they are and add new whips to make it a viable option all troughout a playtrough.

and since they were already adding new "semi-active" weapons for summoners, I'm willing to bet that they do like whips.
some of these things sound actually really good,but that son of an ass fabsol will nerf basically every vanilla item and accesory to all hell,and especially DR and Defense accesories to please the no hitters
Thank you, fabsol, for making the blade staff COMPLETELY USELESS.
    Can't they just increase base damage?
        Its low base damage but high hit rate and armor piercing are its entire point. If you were to just buff its damage, you would go against what it's supposed to be.
            A percentage boost would change nothing about the hit rate or armor piercing. What's so bad about buffing the damage to stay at a similar dps? Does the identity matter when it's solely tied to dps.
How dare they touch my baby the blade staff
i like the EoL change, reminds me of duke now
thats what im doing
    Our only saviour
    How will you name it ? When will it be available ?
        I think they mean they're also waiting

                if i get invested enough i could eventually make it but someone will 100% beat me to it
            Goodluck learning C++üíÄ
                It's C# actually.
                    Tmodloader is in C++, terraria is C# iirc
                        The tModLoader library is C#, and the large majority of the code in tModLoader is C#
whats nerfed?
     zenith is now post yahron 

And most damage reduction accessories and potions are nerfed
        tbf zenith should be the final melee weapon. i have no idea how they implemented it but i hope it's upgraded with some of the calamity aesthetic/weapons
            [deleted]
                FFIV rydia, summoners first appeared in FFIII, but you're point still stands lmao
                    Waaaay back when, FFIV used to be called FFII due to the other games not being released in english.
            no, ark of the cosmos should be the final
                No, ark of the covenant. It gets a bonus if used with Indiana Jones‚Äô whip.
        zenith got insane times for a post-ml weapon on scal. it was on par with post-yharon weapons if not a little worse. though they could've kept it post-ml but nerfed it, and added upgrades to it, but i guess they went the lazy way

idk how to feel about the other changes though
            IIRC, this version was simply designed to come out as quickly as it could, so they took the ‚Äúminimum dev-time‚Äù approach to pretty much everything 1.4-related. We‚Äôll need to wait for a real update to see what their plans are for Zenith and other stuff
        Zenith should be post yharon lol. It's kind of ridiculous even against Scal and exo mechs
    Soaring insignia only gives increased flight time
        bruh...
            Wdym bruh its existence completely destroys the balance of all post moon lord mods including calamity
        Didn't expect anything else. It was the most busted item in 1.4.
Why would they nerf vanilla from the getgo? To make calamity items more used?
    I think most of Calamity takes place after vanilla end game, so now vanilla endgame was extended in 1.4 to include broken weapons which dont need to be balanced in vanilla because you've already won when you get them, but in Calamity then need to be balanced for the upcoming content.
    Vanilla put in insanely overpowered weapons so because there are no post moonlord bosses and it completely throws off the balance of Calamity. If they didn‚Äôt nerf the vanilla weapons probably about half of the post moonlord content in Calimity would have to be reworked completely
    Nah it's more stupid , it's to make the game harder 

They gave damage reduction a soft cap , but it was so easy to reach with just few accessories and some potions , so to fix it they nerfed the damage reduction of said accessories and potions 

Also many items were nerfed to add a new "stage" to the game , for example I found post plantera weapons to be much weaker than vanilla , which forced me to fight another boss before Golem and the cultist

 ( have to say that the last version of calamity I've played was rust and dust , so my information might be outdated )
        I'm all in favor of an actual stage between plantera and golem though. It was always a letdown beating plantera for the first time, going into the temple, and immediately beating golem easily in vanilla.

Most of the nerfs are because in vanilla, everything after the Moonlord can just be awesome and fun and needs no balancing. In Calamity there's a ton of stuff after Moonlord and the vanilla items in 1.4 completely wreck that without nerfs.
Its just a port atm so they havent gotten to nerfing / balancing things like whips.
    Didn't they change the whips damage tags from flat damage to % damage to? Meaning that the blade staff is kinda ass now
        they said they would rework it. not sure if they did though
    It's amazing how the first thing you said was "nerfing" and not "adding", that shows how much calamity devs hate fun
        Well, I mean, calamity wasn't made with whips in mind. It's either they nerf whips, nerf summons, or buff literally everything else.

And since there are probably less whips than summons, it makes sense that they would nerf whips.
            A lot of people ITT are really uppity about the concept of anything getting a nerf, even if it has the potential of completely busting the entire game through one class.
                At the end of the day if you grind enough things or find tricks in Terraria such as building perfect combat arenas and reforging for whatever you need in a fight, you can sort of cheese some bosses. That usually opens doors to progress much faster, and it's normally a part of the game. 

If you use goblin spikes to crush EoW then you get his drops and then it's easier to kill the other start-of-game bosses, for example. Building an arena with teleportation for Plantera underground... etc.

So instead of planned tricks you could use a weapon that is unusually strong early like Scourge of the Corruptor. Or even both the tricks and the weapons. 

But with the nerfs you *must* grind and perfect every arena because at the end of the day, it's more fun to fight when the boss' bullshit is matched or out-matched by the bullshit we build to deal with them. So the end result is... preparation takes more time - you need to grind more. And that's not always fun.
                    I think everything you've said is fair. I even think Calamity is way overtuned on boss difficulty and either the endgame bosses need a nerf or endgame gear needs a buff. I just find a lot of people think nerfing is universally unacceptable, even if it would be both simpler and cleaner to just nerf some things.
                        I agree, sometimes nerfing is the best way about it. 

In this case it's easy to argue against a modder nerfing something that is a part of the base-game though. (why didn't he balance around it like everyone else? why does it even need nerfing when it was accepted in the base game and by other mods? why not just accept that some things may perform better than others instead of nit-picking? and so on)
                            I'd say that, except all of these things in Calamity were made BEFORE the new additions of vanilla 1.4.

So either...

1.  Calamity has to completely re-design it's endgame around the new numbers and potential of base game.

Or

2. Calamity nerfs the numbers/adjust the time of obtaining of a few of the new items.
        Not defending Fabsol, but adding whips in a 1.4 port patch wouldn‚Äôt make sense anyway. iirc other devs promised to add new whips later on so that‚Äôs good
Same. Journey mode, master mode difficulty slider. Less grind, the same difficulty.
    don't forget malice mode for extra suffering
        Also masochist mode form fargo's
            then we turn that mob spawnrate *aaaaaaall* the way up!
            Sadly Malice (or death) mode + eternity mode is impossible to complete. This is entirely due to Golem having conflicting mechanics that make him invincible to all damage in phase 2 when both are active. Every other boss is possible to beat with both modes activated. Skeletron Prime is another hard one, since you'll only be able to hit it for 1 damage every single attack, but still theoretically possible.
                Imagine fucking *GOLEM* ending your challenge playthrough that shit's just so funny to me
                This is actually possible because you can get the Eidolon Tablet which summons Lunatic Cultist. Eidolists that drop this item, spawn in 3rd layer of Abyss and start appearing after Wall of Flesh has been defeated.
    Or‚Ä¶ hear me out‚Ä¶ Master Mode with 10x spawns.
        And every enemy is a Draedon Mech
            Playing the game the way god intended
                God? I don't think so, but how that son of a bitch fabsol intended? Definitely 

(Still really salty about everything)
InB4 Fabsol makes it so you instantly die when opening a Journey world
oh gods, no. that is a thousand, thousand items to learn!  time to get the "simple research" mod
    Is there any mod which ads a hotkey for research (simple research was unbalanced last time I checked due to lack of crafting table check)
        they might have fixed that, i've had no issue with simple research. just hit one button and everything researchable in yer inventory is gobbled up.  and it also has a research hotkey as well.
        there's a mod that allows you to research the entire inventory at once if available, I can't remember the name though.
yea gonna do a rev journey mage :)

        ü§ì
There‚Äôs researching support right now, I‚Äôd say it looks like they‚Äôre fine with Journey
    And then they pee their pants and whine when you use a qol mod. Well mostly Fabsol from what I've heard but nobody there has publicly disagreed.
    Journey mode has automatic support with modded items. Just you wait
[deleted]
    Isn't to low for fabsol from what I've seen
    Trailer shows Journey mode
    The only unresearchable ones are Schematics (supposed to be unique) and like what, Boss Rush drop? And Journey isn‚Äôt nerfed. I hope this doesn‚Äôt change because Fabsol can he like that but things are fine so far
        That's good news, hopefully it stays that way. You're definitely right about him being the type to change it. If Alchemist NPC is cheating to him, journey mode is absolutely cheating.
[deleted]
    Thankfully there is always cheat sheet and hero's mod to fix that.
        thank god, for not ruining our only way of finishing malice mode king slime
            Is it that bad?
    That isn't new. Even before 1.4 DoG and Providence could deal with cheat sheet's godmode
Why?
    It's a known thing that in the modding community alot of people use smaller content mods alongside calamity , then shit talk about smaller content mods for falling behind and items being too weak
        That's the thing I like the least about Calamity players, they act like it's part of Vanilla Terraria and not a mod, and constantly shit on everyone who doesn't balance things around Calamity, instead of... y'know, Terraria.
            This is why I kind of prefer not using Calamity. The only real loss is the end-game bosses, all the way up to that the other mods are very nice... and Calamity breaks the early-game's balance and vanilla tricks.
            If anything, Thorium should be the mod to balance around.
                I still don't understand how Calamity is more popular than Thorium. After playing both, I feel like Thorium is the better mod. It integrates with the base game much better.
                    Most popular things rarely are objectively best.
                        Popular things are the those which are advertised the most, like RLCraft from minecraft.
                        Well I wouldn‚Äôt say ‚Äúobjectively best‚Äù, but yeah Thorium is better (even if it doesn‚Äôt the rogue class, but that‚Äôs easily surpassed by techniques).
                    Calamity: MODDED terraria 

Thorium: modded TERRARIA
                Didn't Thorium used to be like... really bad? or am I thinking of a different one
                    No no, you are thinking of tremor.

Thorium is the golden classic one.
                        You're totally right, I am thinking of Tremor.
                        Oh god, Tremor, I forgot that happened. Thorium is pretty fun though.
            To be fair, they did nerf everything down in their last major update to have things balanced around vanilla (Murasama went from 20000 to 3000 for instance). Their endgame is still more OP than other mod endgames, but it means it's much safer to use Calamity weapons with other mods during certain points of progression.
        Ah okay ty.
    I would assume they mean that a lot of people will just go straight to playing calamity again rather than try other mods, which isnt good for mods without large fanbases. Also calamity is pretty much incompatable with tmod itself lmao.
        Nah did a playthrough while waiting for calamity to update, now gonna do a playthrough of calamity lol,

Really interested in the changes to summoner again, haven't been in the discord
            Happy cake day!
    Calamity is the largest mod
Try the vitality mod highly recommend
Lol
not gonna lie this shit looks rushed as hell i barely see any changes to any of the new vanilla bosses.
    Currently they‚Äôre still working on tons of balance changes to pretty much every aspect of the game, as well as implenting 1.4 features (pylons, whips, etc) to fit with calamity‚Äôs new biomes and further progression. They just released it now so that the community could play it and report bugs and issues to make it an even better experience in the future
        TRUE i was just gonna say its most likely just a port to tml 1.4 rather than new content but still i feel like they could delay it a little to add a bit more content and incentive to play it more. however im not a dev so i wouldn't know
            I don't follow modding stuff so might be wrong but I believe they did a poll asking if people would prefer they delay it until more content is added or release early so people can play with it, and most people voted for early release so that's what they did.
            for people who were still playing 1.3 calamity, this update DOES add new content: 1.4's content
            Dude it‚Äôs free lol
                just cause its free doesn't mean its good or free from any ounce of criticism
                    Thinking it‚Äôs good is irrelevant. Complaining about the lack of content (if it‚Äôs so good that you want more) is dumb when it‚Äôs free and in the works
    Isn't the main point of the port to get update from Calamity though? As in being able to play existing Calamity mod on 1.4.
    Man, people will complain about anything these days. What do you mean "rushed as hell"? 
 

 Not gonna lie, it kinda sounds like you are used to dealing with actual games getting rushed, like Cyberpunk. 
 
 
Calamity isn't a full game where the devs made a promise, took money, and failed to deliver on that promise and released an unfinished game. This is a mod with a fully playable version that is completely free, and they just happened to give people access to a newer version they are working on.
 
 
And if I come across as a dick here, it's because I really appreciate the crazy amount of work the devs put into Calamity, and it just blows my mind that someone who is able to play it completely free can complain about it like this. It just feels so entitled.
    I mean I would accept a 1.4 version even if it didn't have any major changes
The Calamity team have some serious talent when it comes to art. From the actual "art" like this titles screen, to the incredible sound track. I really hope they end up working on their own original game some day.
    Well the guy responsible for the incredible soundtrack left because players were sending death threats. So it's unlikely he's ever part of any calamity project ever again.
        Holy shit man, WTF is wrong with people? You'd want to have an extremely empty life to do something like that.
This is the first time I see it, and I have to say the lettering looks *very* edgy.
    it's been the logo for calamity for like 4 years, back when the mod was trying very hard to be edgy
just continue playing it,OR BETTER YET transfer your world from 1.3 to 1.4 because calamity has a issue with world gen at the moment
    What version of calamity has an issue with world gen?
        1.4 calamity, dont worry your 1.3 stuff will remain
            Can you explain to me how to do that or link me something?
                np chief, to transfer your worlds from 1.3 to 1.4 you need to activate the 1.4 version, Doing that is very simple as you just need to right click the config button on the tmodloader at your library, Then click properties and betas, Then select none to go to 1.4, From there onward you need to click on "transfer worlds" on world creation, Then select your Map and Voila! your world should supposed to be transfered, but if dont, then just continue playing on 1.3 or wait to the devs to fix the 1.4 issue
                    Got it thanks a bunch üôè
                        no problem chief, always happy to help somebody
we almost defeated Moon Lord on 1.3 and decided to restart now.
I‚Äôm *not* a fan or alcNPC with calamity. Somehow alcNPC manages to be overpowered for calamity and breaks progression.

AlcNPC lite, however, I can get behind.
    I second this, AlcNPC is a bit broken but lite is ok. The "infinite mana" thing got me to uninstall it post ML.
    Personally i am not a fan of lite, lite causes all the potions to cost like 90 gold at all times and god forbid you try to buy a modded potion.
Fabsol screaming rn
Regular AlchemistNPC, you will probably find a turbo broken ‚Äúlegendary‚Äù weapon that scales with your progression and you will have no reason to use anything else because of how powerful it will be. AlchemistNPC lite is where the fun is at imo
Don't really need it anymore. Npc's sell potions and it unlocks as you progress
I remember some other mod that added content to calamity, including a conch that takes you to the sulphuric sea. Finally glad to have that QOL available by default
inb4 fabsol makes it so that the magic conch only sends you to the regular ocean
    makes sense tho, but also just use The alchemist npc( not the mod name but the npc) beach teleporter, or just walk
    You've given him the idea, now.
Chad + based
Fuck you

Take an upvote
made it post-yharon
    best possible choice they could have done tbh. It'd suck to see Zenith doing 3k damage for being such an amazing weapon concept lol.
        From what was shown in a video, it dealt same amount of damage as pre-DoG weapons, but they moved it post-DoG. Apart from its insanely good attack animation, its actually worse than other post-DoG melee weapons damage wise.
            It kinda fucking deletes the exo mechs and Scal so idk.
                It doesn't delete them, far from it. The dps was similar to a DoG weapon. The main advantage was its animation. It passes through blocks and requires no aiming. So, basically it has 100% uptime.
    [deleted]
        I'd imagine the various accessories and armor you get leading up to Zenith in Calamity would have made it more OP. Base game Zenith was never intended to be balanced after all.
            For people that haven't played Calamity, pretty much every class in the game gets a set of accessories that scale in power as the player progresses w/ new tiers that can be crafted as new materials become available. It's sorta like the power glove line for melee except every class gets something similar. 

Also I'm doubting it, but would the Zenith count as true melee? Because sweet baby jesus that'd be sick w/ all the accessories that buff true melee.
                I think it would and is then the reason it gets pushed to post Yharon
                I mean technically speaking it's true melee, you just happen to be chucking the sword at the enemy faster and from further away. You are still *technically* hitting them with the main part of the sword(s). From a gameplay standpoint? No way in hell it would be true melee.
        Litetally shredding exo-mechs and scal.
        it is
        i mean it for a post moon lord weapon that was auric telsa tier of course they would have to make it post yharon other than that some of the other stuff they nerfed was stupid
        prolly made it that op
Non of it is all that impactfull despite so many people whining about it. I think that you should be fine as long as you don't play malice mode
    Okie doki! ü•õ
Nerfs on items are very needed. In normal terraria they let empress and moon lord give you too many op items because they are the final boss(fair enough), however in modded they have bosses in between or after every normal boss. Having infinite flight and insane flight speed for mediocre wings against bosses that already lower wing flight time is just too op. Or even buffed moonlord items that can kill providence 1.2x faster than the huge crafting tree modded ones is too unfair. They aren‚Äôt nerfing, just balancing.
    I suppose, but I‚Äôve heard about a lot of unnecessary changes that do nothing but ruin a lot of people‚Äôs fun? Idk
youre kinda forgetting that the mod adds content and doesnt just nerf existing items like most people in this thread, id have thought youd wanna focus on new stuff no?
Yeah, I played a calamity run on expert mode with my friends like 8 months ago. I'm wondering if it's as hard as people are saying it is now. I thought it was much harder then the base game already though.
    Yeah, it‚Äôs already insanely hard, so I don‚Äôt get why the developers are trying to make it harder? It seemed like one of em cared more about making a hard mod than a fun mod to play- in my experience, If your changes to the game ruin the fun of it, that‚Äôs a pretty bad choice. Fargo‚Äôs is pretty good with this, as you do have to be good at the game to get through bosses, but you feel accomplished doing it instead of just pissed off by the end and wanting it over with- even if the mech bosses are getting to that point with how hard it is to see their tells
IMO, calamity is the definitive way to play terraria. It does nerf some op stuff, but is also buffs a bunch and has so much qol that should just be in the game. Stuff like non consumable boss summons, early game movement speed and mining speed buff, enemy nerf before a boss is defeated, etc.
    Calamity is a mediocre mod. Zenith should be located Post-Providence, as it deals around that level of DPS. Sure, it obliterates Polterghast, but it would do nothing to the Exo-Mechs or SCal. The content is not actually that high quality, Starlight River will be a content mod of similar size, which DOESN‚ÄôT nerf or move existing items, and will also add super high quality content. The Stars Above isn‚Äôt as big as Calamity, but it is much higher quality and doesn‚Äôt rebalance vanilla. Spirit, Split, Endless Escapade, Ancients Awakened, and many more are way better than Calamity.
        You have no idea what you are talking about. When you use on tier gear and zenith, it destroys exo mechs and SCal. Most of calamity's nerfs and moves are needed as vanilla is kind of broken. The quality of the other mods are completely subjective. Calamity may not have the best visuals out there, but they're not bad. Plus, the fights and difficulty is great.
No, the dev didn't leave, he just spammed the subreddit with a bunch of sockpuppets, and the owner of the subreddit shut it down "for the good of the community" because he didn't want to run the subreddit anymore
misinformation and general redditor stuff
wym
    Continuously they make baffling changes, harass their users and add complicated garbage, all while slowly wringing fun out of the old good content.
        The problem is that fabsol has a specific vision for how he wants his mod to be played and nobody is allowed to disagree, but a majority of players don't agree with how fabsol wants the mod to be played.
            Fabsol uses she/her pronouns.
        I don‚Äôt have much of an issue with where the mod is rn, I think it‚Äôs fun.

Fabsiol can fuck right off though
        the fuck are you talking about?? define complicated garbage
Starbound frackin devs seem similar too
    Fuck... I didn't need to be reminded lol
it does
Apparently you can transfer 1.3 worlds to 1.4 or sumn, thats what I read in a comment
What if I like calamity but hate the devs

"NOO YOU CANT ENJOY CALAMITY SPLIT IS A FAR SUPERIOR MOD AND ALSO SPIRIT AND THORIUM AND YOURE A SWEATY PLAYER!!!!" 

"hehe, Jetstream sam character go brrrrrrrrrrrrr"
    i just like killing gods and the abyss and stuff
        I just like it's support with the Stars Above mod

tl;dr i like killing gods with weapons obtained from killing gods. And star godess but that's beside the point
            I too like the star waifus
            Playing Calamity can be really stressful, and having a cute star lady occasionally show up to tell me that I'm doing great really helps alleviate that.
    MEMORIES BROKEN INTENSIFIES (I hear boss music \m/)
i'm honestly trying to figure out why this community became so negative and bitter about calamity as of late. i know a lot of people don't agree with the changes from vanilla and some of the nerfs that have been happening, that's fine. 

but i missed the point where everyone started bashing the devs for what are essentially preferential gameplay changes. i don't really feel we should be bashing mod devs for their gameplay vision, doesn't really matter if it's a big mod or a small mod.

mini rant, probably won't go over well, but the modded terraria community has disappointed me on all sides as of late. at some point we need to realize that this cycle of negativity is helping literally nobody
    I think its mostly due to misinformation about fabsol and the devs


Yea fabsol can be kind of a dick but i dont think he even uses reddit and also not all of the devs act like fabsol
    I never got the hate with calamity being balanced around itself when Ancients awakened dragon superboss takes 1 damage from every weapon that isnt AA or vanilla
        Calamity balancing the rest of the game around itself kills its compatibility with basically every other mod that doesnt specifically allow for clamity compatability.
            yes but AA just did that but worse, with the superboss basically forcing you to use AA weapons only
                I never said that aa wasnt bad
        i think a lot people use calamity's vast popularity as an excuse to quite frankly be assholes about it, for lack of better word.
            Ye, its kinda people being mad at people who like charizard from pokemon despite it being overrated, like The Big mac has a place in the table for a reason, plus its not like Calamity being installed makes you unable to play other mods
    People complaining that those making free content aren't making the free content exactly the way they want. 

Newsflash: calamity isn't a democracy or a publicly traded company who answers to anyone. They make the mod they want to make. If you don't like it or don't like the developers, then don't play it and don't support it. Make your own mod instead, and when it's inevitably crap, and you have a bunch of mouth breathers whining about every decision you make, you'll might emphasize.
        Here before you get called an alt lmao
            Probably, don't work on calamity or Terraria mods, but I am a game developer myself. I can't imagine working for free, for a bunch of freeloaders to whine and whinge about every decision I make. I'd tell them to go fuck themselves, too.
                yep, this is pretty much exactly how i feel on the matter. i sympathize with the devs and i hope this recent wave of needless toxicity isn't affecting them too heavily.

this is a great mod, no i don't necessarily agree with the way it does some things, but there are always better ways to discuss these things. raging and bashing won't convince the devs, if anything it'll probably do the opposite. that's how passion projects work

    Fab has twitter?
    i get not liking fab he can be kind of a dick sometimes but jesus calm down
        i dont think he even has a twitter god damn people on reddit will believe literally anything you tell them at face value if it allows them to circlejerk
in all serious though even if this isnt a big update its gonna be fun to eventually play a journey rev mage playthrough and use stuff like block replacements so my dome houses can be those furniture sets that are too late in the game for house building
    Mage is so fun, you're so ridiculously powerful yet you're made of essentially glass
        hell yea who doesnt love a good ol glass cannon
Have you forgotten? We are on reddit, home to the worst of the worst in the mod community, sanity sadly barely exists here
Uhuh
Why rip to smaller mods? It‚Äôs not like they just lost something they ever had to begin with??
    Well because smaller mods were easier to port over/ easier to create with the new update, it made it so those were the first mods available for 1.4. People wanted to play 1.4 modded but didn't have access to older mods, so it allowed people to branch out in ways they maybe wouldn't if major mods were still available. So now that more major mods are started to get ported, there's gonna be a drop in people checking out smaller mods.
    But now everyone who was making do with the smaller mods and enjoying them while calamity was being ported now get shoved from the limelight they have had eluded from them for so long
Why not r/calamitymod?

            He kinda made a bunch of alts to defend himself with on that sub specifically soo... he kinda did have something to do on there. He also constantly told people they should play a certain kind of way (without nurse exploit, without the alchemy mod etc.) and called people trash if they didn't play the mod as he intended.

edit: r/calamitymod_ even has a rule saying that telling others to "get good" is a bannable offense so yea. I think that might be referring to his actions.

edit: apparently the get good rule wasn't inspired by our favorite toxic dev, and the alts were of some other salty kid. Sry for that, other stuff is accurate thou
                as a mod of the new subreddit, fabsol had nothing to do with the original subreddit, the alts were made by some toxic kid and we were sent proof of it. the get good rule is unrelated
                    Dang. Oh well, thx for clarification and sorry for misinformation.
                        U should add another edit on your original comment saying it‚Äôs untrue if you‚Äôre really sorry :v
                            People don't really care about what the truth is, they just like to have excuses to blame people they don't like :)

                                no fucking way your getting downvoted for this reply

that's a nice argument, Senator, why don't you back it up with a source?
                    It happened, trust me.

[...like, unironically.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CalamityMod/comments/v59ub6/fabsol_trying_to_not_be_a_jerk_challenge/) Here's the [image](https://i.redd.it/olxg1vuyur391.jpg) the post came with.
                        Although there is proof of him being a jackass there is none of him using alts.
                            Multiple accounts a few days old defending him? (as in the ONLY accounts defending him?) If this isn't enough proof for you, you're experiencing mental disociation.
                                Weird you wanna say im disassociating because there is no proof. You are almost as toxic as he is in those screenshots. If you think alts repeating what he said verbatim is proof or evidence I would recommend that you not be any profession like a police officer or lawyer. Would not make a great fit. If you have any way to link it back to him and not trolls or people just trying to stir the pot or add fuel to the fire be my guest and I will eat my words.

What have I done to have brought the wrath of redditors upon myself? I've been waiting for clamity to release to 1.4 to play with friends and enjoy all the new content from vanilla and modded combined!!
    because fuck you in particular, apparently
    reddit moment
    Calamity multiplayer lol.
Ha. You poor thing
    Isnt summoner already op in calamity? the "nerfs" to the whips are still a power increase to an already strong class
more like the community imploding because people are having fun playing one of the best mods
The mod itself is good. The devs, though, are awful.

That's about where I'm at.
fabsol can be kind of a dick but he's not like a genuinely horrible person like people here would make you believe afaik

&#x200B;

and the other devs seem really cool from what i've seen in discord
    Thing is, I know that. I've been a patron of the mod since 2019. It hurts seeing the names of these people I know get trashed for behavior that they really don't exhibit.
        yea sadly thats reddit for yea
https://calamitymod.wiki.gg/wiki/2.0.0.001
The GOG version can use tModLoader (and thus the mod browser) just fine. Download it from the official Terraria forums (the way it was done before the Steam version) and you're good to go.
    but I thought they'll stop updating the forum link?
Try actually playing it
Have you ever considered that it was balanced to work around new vanilla content that is usually overpowered for the tier it‚Äôs at because normally it would be the end of the game, but only 2/3 in the mod?
    It was like that in 1.3 as well
Can't you import characters and worlds?
People are allowed to not like things. Just like you're allowed to like things. Enjoy playing Calamity, no one can or should tell you not to. But you also can't tell people they have to like what you like.
    he did not once say they werent allowed to dislike the mod, literally just making an observation
its so fucked up how this wholesome-ass comment is downvoted.
    ye the dude dao apparently has a hateboner, but apparently Fabsol is the big bad guys he doesnt let us use qol mods even tho i can play just fine with alchemist npc lite and Luiafk
I fucking love playing with Calamity. The only thing that really ruffles my jimmys is that he took away my teleports during bossfights. Maybe a little exploity, but he seems to care about "playing the right way" a bit too much
Based
triples the games content with enemy ai that makes a slime look like the final boss and unoriginal weapons and designs that don‚Äôt even fit the gameüíÄ go play Fargos
    Fargos also doesn't fit the game lol
        Fargo reworks all bosses and makes them challenging yet an actually fun experience rather than a bullet sponge + high damage, sure the forces and shit are strange (yet cool, you can literally stop time) but other than that it‚Äôs a super vanilla mod
    just use the texture pack, 1.4 has a support for texture packs and its far more easier to do now
You're allowed to have your opinion, but you seem to think other people aren't allowed to have theirs. That's what makes you an asshole, not liking Calamity.
    There's a difference between having an opinion and being an asshole who has to shout it from the rooftops at every available opportunity. When a new Justin Beiber song releases, do I go to that community to tell them it's shit? When a YouTuber I don't like uploads a new video, am I there ASAP to post that they're fat/ugly and their video sucks? Do I ask everyone who buys an iPhone why they're okay being treated like a child in regard to how they're allowed to use it after spending $1000? Do I walk into people's houses and tell them their house looks like it was furnished/decorated by a broke, blind 95-year-old?

No because it's none of my business. I didn't pay money for any of these things, and nobody gives a rat's ass about my opinion, no matter how factually correct I may consider my opinion to be. If you go out of your way to spew negativity for something that you didn't pay for and doesn't concern you, then you are in fact an asshole.
Yes. But the Devs can't guarantee anything. Check the discord for more info
There is only 1 boss that my brain can register is bullet hell right now just to let ya know
    theres definitely more, both Calamitas fights, a Provi attack, a Yharon attack and now Rev+ EOL ig
Why not both?
    I've been playing with Stars Above and Calamity in 1.3, they work pretty well together and Stars Above even makes commentary on Calamity stuff.
    They don't seem to be working alongside at this moment. Tried to load them, only 1 works at a time.
    Calamity is too bloated to run with other mods.
        I tried running it with thorium, the 32-bit memory limit meant I ran out of memory often. Tmod has never been as unstable as it was then. I picked calamity over thorium
            why you playing calamity with thorium tho, Like these two are like mentos and cocacola, never be put together
                I had read somewhere that the special ocean of biome of thorium was chosen on the opposite side of the abyss specifically to let it be used with calamity. I also saw a video where someone was playing both together. I don't know much about thorium, but it didn't grab me like calamity did.
                    yeah but like thorium is severely underpowered compared to calamity, if you want a mod that goes well with calamity play the stars above
???
omg i know right, i guess people have a huge hateboner for basically a free dlc
>Most of the bosses already dissable infinite flight

what, why? that sounds dumb
    yeah, it is
        calamity devs hate fun in general
            you don‚Äôt enjoy dozens of bullet bell boss fights with .1%  chance of dropping the item you want that becomes completely useless once you beat the next boss?
                wait till calamity loot swap comes in, or Better yet just get alchemist npc Operator and a shitton of platinum and buy the bags
                    Calamity devs on their way to make the mod uncompatible with Alchemist NPC and many other QoL mods
                        Bam, re compatibility patch specifically that requires calamity and alchemist  or whatever mod so MAKE it compatible again.
                        dont give them ideias
                The 1% drops get stronger the further you get into the game so the weapons don‚Äôt fall off too fast.
                    That's *ooooooold* Calamity, man. Legendary drops haven't scaled in *YEARS*.
                        Wait so halibut cannon used to get better, does it not now?
                            Halibut still does. All the other old legendaries like Aegis Blade, Blossom Flux, etc. don't anymore (and in my opinion, they're in the least creative and most unrewarding state they've ever been in).
            They pander to try hards and masochists, have you seen the levels in difficulty they added
                brother if you think a higher level of difficulty thats basically a way superior master mode without being simply damage buffs to enemies means its for masochist then look at master mode for the worthy hardcore no wasd copper shortsword only
            Calamity devs had a very different idea of fun a few years ago. Maybe Dokuro stepping down messed with Drew in some way, but the mod took a huge turn for the lame in the past few updates.
            [removed]
                [removed]
            yeah thats why there are countless QOL changes that make the game more fun then i spose
            Not every mod is tailored to your play style. Making dumbass statements like that reflects poorly on yourself, I'd recommend avoiding that in the future.
                Chill brother, I like playing Calamity but it's undeniable that the devs make some questionable decisions regarding fun. Don't know why you got all offended about it though. You don't need to be so protective of a terraria mod lmao.
                    Not every mod is tailored to your play style. Making dumbass statements like that reflects poorly on yourself, I'd recommend avoiding that in the future.
            Don‚Äôt play it then
                Is this a Fabsol alt?
                not happ'n'n
theres very few bosses that do this and its not even a big deal
    exactly, there's no reason to nerf Soaring Insignia
        The primary effect of it isnt even the infinite flight, its the DOUBLED vertical acceleration which is mad. Infinite flight is pretty good but if youre good with your hook its not a game changer but pretty good, to be fair the item was over-nerfed but it was busted before with the unopposed flight mobility.
First time I heard someone talk about my mod, that's pretty neat

I'll have to try if it actually works with the calamity nerfs because if calamity overrides the correct thing it would also affect my boots
    Doing God's work bro üôè
    Not really, if you set up the new accessory with weird loopholes like +9999 flight time instead of flightTime = max (i haven't worked with flight time so excuse my ignorance if this is wrong)
        I don't use flight time at all, there is a parameter called empressBrooch that I just set to true.But Calamity overrides that exact parameter so I'll just set flight time to max or a really high value with a config if someone likes the calamity nerf
            Ah that would make sense. I think you could just have the accessory have that max time you're talking about, since the rocket boots add to the flight time of wings, so it makes sense for other accessories to increase the flight time as eell
    What is your mod
ngl, that mod is probably the only way the Soaring Insignia would be worthwhile when using a large mod like Calamity.  No matter how useful it is, an accessory with one and a half really good effects pales in comparison to an accessory with a handful of good effects with how limited accessory slots are.
    antisocial is so good if you wanna have more accesory slots, but you might think its cheaty
Can I get the name of the mod, pretty please?

        Ty mate.
I would also like to request the mods name if you'd be so kind

Just wanted to tell that there is now a config where you can decide if you want the nerf to apply for the boots as well or not (The default value is to ignore the nerf and grant infinite flight anyways)
Mod name please

yeah that seems balanced
Not fun, just fun that differs from their own ideas. No one is allowed to use QOL mods, the nurse, nothing that changes fabsol's idea of how his mod should be played.
    Damn, I feel the stuck-upness through the screen, ESPECIALLY from a guy, whose half of ideas consists of stealing everything possible from MGR:R (one-off references are okay, but when your most powerful weapon is directly from that game without name changes, and you incorporate the absolutely not fitting health UI into Terraria, then it gets kinda suspect) and spongify vanilla bosses for "challenge"
        Fabsol seems like he's trying to take Calamity in two different directions at the same time. All of the MGR references are fun nods to (presumably) fab's favorite game, which he's totally allowed to do. It's literally his mod, after all. However, at the same time, he's trying to turn "Terraria" into "Calamity." The Health UI and boss AI changes definitely make it feel like Calamity is designed as its own experience, and while that's also totally okay, the way that "mod with a bunch of references made for fun" and "mod that's designed to overhaul your entire play experience" mix in Calamity is not done well. I personally love Calamity. I always have, and I play the shit out of it whenever I can, but it's definitely got its problems.
    well i play with ore excavator, Alchemist, overhaul, ther content mods and Luiafk 

mainly because i suck at the game without these but that doesn‚Äôt matter
    [deleted]
        They don't. QoL mods are unaffected, the nurse is disabled when a boss is alive solely when playing in Death mode, etc.
        they dont
        They don't.
    dude nothing is stoping you from playing without those, alchemist npc is still usable and so is ore excavator
    What's he gonna do about it?
        Nerf a bunch of things people found fun.
            he does that anyways
Its not that bad is it?
    Calamity? Calamity is fine. Some well made, interesting content. But the devs hate any alternate way of playing the game other than their very firm vision and will work in nerfs to alternate playstyles. Hard. Hence soaring insignia being heavily nerfed.
        This whole Calamity thing reminds me of Gregtech drama from Minecraft's FeedtheBeast (FtB) mod packs way back in the day. 


Sorry for the long post.
TLDR; Greg liked Grind=Power and applied it to a ton popular mods in modpacks that included his Gregtech mod. Players didn't like having to spend a lot of time to get simple automation. Mod Creators had their own vision for their mod and didn't like him messing with it. It caused a lot of drama.


And now the post:
For those that don't know FtB mod packs were a bundle of minecraft mods that usually focused on factory building and industrialization. Think Factorio before Factorio existed.


One of the mods included was called Gregtech which was a mid-endgame expansion to the very popular Industrialcraft 2 mod.  Greg was the mod creator and had a mindset of working hard to earn powerful rewards. If you got to endgame with this mod it delivered on this vision with some ludicrously strong production, storage, sorting, and power generation.


The problem came in with the fact that Greg thought this mindset should be applied to all mods in a mod pack that included Gregtech and a lot of the popular modpacks had Gregtech included. Greg would adjust the recipes of machines from other mods to make them significantly more time consuming and expensive. For example a simple flint and steel went from 1 flint and 1 iron ingot to 1 flint and 1 steel ingot. A steel ingot required a few different machines to produce as opposed to iron only needing a furnace.


This irked a lot of players and mod creators. A good chunk of players didn't like the added grind to everything and the factory building part of the mod pack took significantly longer to both get to and build.  Mod creators were quite annoyed since they had their own vision of how their progression in their mod worked and communication with Greg was apparently frustrating.


Eventually the outcry got loud enough that the modpack creators split packs into a version that included Gregtech and one that didnt. Also mod creators were creating their own recipie "packs" that you could swap to in the config file and usually included a "Vanilla" version. Not entirely sure what happened after the split as shortly after that I stopped playing FtB for a while.
            Good explanation. However, instead of explaining all this you can just tell to anyone curious to play GT NH (GregTech: New Horizons) and it will be self-explanatory
                Thank you! This Calamity drama just kinda dug out a memory from like 9 years ago. I haven't played as much FtB or FtB styled modpacks in recent years and don't really know what Gregtech New Horizons is, but given who he is my guess is that it is months worth of grind with increasingly complex systems that end in you becoming some kind of industrial god.
                    Cool to see someone who was around back then in the wild! I still remember playing RedPower and looking at the movable frames - it was like Create, years before Create
                        Yea man it was some good times. My friend group had a whole server running with the Ultimate pack and we had some fun coming up with factories that combined multiple mods into an amalgam of industry.
                            I loved that. Have you played modded Minecraft recently? Create: Above and Beyond was a great modpack (although endgame was kind of too math-ey for me)
            I haven't heard about calamities developers much but the sentiment here reminds me of Starbounds Frackin Universe dev and similar criticisms going towards him. He literally made an update to his mod that detected another mod that reverted a nerf he made to a certain planet type(making them useless to visit). In the code he made a line called ''Idiot Check'' which checks if people are using the mod, and essentially causes every weather effect to happen at the same time and kill the player.  He's had a history of doing other things in that ballpark but holy moly that was ridiculous.
        It's funny. As soon as I encountered the insignia when 1.4 came out my first thought regarding modded was "oh yeah, calamity is gonna make this useless"
        That, plus the artstyle/UI clashes (just some of the artstyle doesn't fit terraria at all), most bosses being either the souped-up versions of vanilla bosses or touhou-like bullet hells, and visual effect overload that only plummets performance on my laptop are the reasons why I didn't wind up playing Calamity
            THIS this right here. It's the attempts at re-writing the lore that get me the worst, the art looks like it belongs in Starbound instead of Terraria, and everything that the devs have written reads like something a 13 year old AOL roleplayer from the 90s wrote.
                At this point calamity feels like a diffrent game so I dont see a point complaining about it having a diffrent art style or weird lore.
                You mean, re-writting terraria's official, OPTIONAL, lore that's very basic and mediocre at best? Yeah, the lore is bad, but it's getting fixed to be better written, so this could all change. Terraria also got more and more detailed art style, see EoL. The art style is a matter of TASTES my dude. There are texture packs for a reason, and mods shouldn't be forced to cater to one artstyle as many mods don't. If the art style is to detailed and too complex for your liking, there are texture packs out there that could possibly change it all to look like earlier vanilla like sprites, or versely, if you just want consistency there is a mod that makes all the art of vanilla more detailed like cal.
            eh the only real bullet hell boss is SCal, and the effects are meh, the Radiance mod on the other hand, now ***that's*** a bullet hell with amazing effects, it turns EoL into a fucking brutal fight
                Tbh radiance feels much more fair, the bullethell is harder and you get oneshot, but you'll probably never feel like you were killed by a projectile you couldn't see, yellow on black makes it very clear what's going on, unlike scal (or yharon) where all projectiles are red, the enemy is red and there also is a heavy red filter makin everything else on screen red, so every moving thing on screen blends into a deep red mush.
                    yeah for sure, SCal is a pain in the ass cuz you can't see the projectiles
            I will say the art think is subjective, and many mods do a similar thing too in their own way, plus there is a mod to retexture it to fit more with the art direction of cal, so. And touhou-like bosses aren't a bad thing. It's when they poorly designed bullet hails is when problems arise. The visual overload sounds like a device problem than the mod problem though. The vanilla style of boss is a matter of taste, so you have every right to not want to play it for you reasons. But I want to make sure the subjective is not phrased in a way that makes it come off objective. And to make things that ALL mods are guilty come to light. I hate this argument used against Cal when other bigger mods are also guilty of this, not just cal. Plus, who cares if the art style is different? Minecraft mods have done the same. and like Minecraft, terraria has texture pack options, so this isn't a real factor for not playing the mod imo. The way they handle their boss fights and how it effects other mods? Yeah, a more valid reason imo given that unlike artstyles that can be changed with texture packs, this is more skin deep than the latter. 

Also, as a laptop player myself, playing any mods with friends, I having a lot lags the game. Which is why I eventually plan to go PC to handle it.
                i hate when people blame calamity for not being balanced with other mods when other mods are doing that and dont get blamed, like ancients awakened( which is a worse calamity made by a even more terrible person) has it final boss take 1 damage if youre using weapons that arent AA or vanilla, so for example if youre playing with stars above and u use bury the light on the boss it only deals 1 damage
                    That sucks, yet it seems we are in the minority as evident by my down vote and massive mindless up votes for the comment above. Yeah, most other mods don't even balance that well around vanilla either. A good portion do, but not all. And when you get serious like me and try to call this out or just talk respectful in general, you are: hated, down voted, memed on, rumor spread about you, trashed talked about you behind your back, so much more and become INFAMOUS among the internet like me.

I hate the online and irl to a extent. The world kind of sucks imo.
        May I ask what their vision is? Just deciding if ny playstyle fits
            The way to fight bosses is as close to no-hit as possible. Bosses tend towards screen filling bullet hells. Everything does absurd amounts of damage. You can get hit a few times, but defense is heavily nerfed, and flying/movement is actively nerfed in many fights. You're heavily rewarded for not getting hit at all in general.

Which you know, is fine! Some people like the pattern-learning style. But I don't like how they force it on people by crowbarring out every mechanic that threatens it or suddenly becomes unbalanced because it's good in their hyper specific world.
                Thank you I will give it a pass..... I am not the bewt at dodging so what you describe sounds like plain frustration to me.
                    Nothing wrong with that. There are lots of excellent mods out there. It's worth giving it a try, since there is always adjustable difficulty. But I really don't like the design philosophy and have things I enjoy much more.
        Ah sounds exactly DE's intentions with warframe
        Yep, like nerfing basically how the Lava Charm and its other accessories worked in 1.3.? Luckily, you could turn that option off but, Idk if that still happens with 1.4.
        i really dont understand the uproar, the accesory is busted OP and would be even more so in Calamity where movement is even more vital. you want them to intentionally leave it unbalanced or what?
            Busted OP? I mean, you're allowed to have your opinion! I think that spending a whole accessory slot on movement should give you better movement. And more importantly, is this an uproar? I just gave my opinion.
                nah, the uproar wasnt yours i just meant people here in general. but it DOUBLES vertical acceleration. I think they did nerf it too much to the point where youre right and its barely worth using which is a bit of a shame though
        Surely you can play without it right? Plus it should be fine since the devs found it necessary for the vision of their creation right?
            I'm sure I can! I never said it was mandatory for playing or anything. Just that it's fun and the devs hate fun. It's a running theme for Calamity design decisions in my opinion.
    [deleted]
    Yeah, I really dislike the devs tbh. Calamity is absolutely fantastic, but they have made some pretty terrible decisions imo and on more than one occasion have been complete assholes about things when the community complains about it.
        I see it as a case of bad design, amazing execution. I don‚Äôt agree with all their decisions and I like terraria for it‚Äôs flexibility after all
             I feel like a lot of cal's content can be really bland or bullshitty at times, but you can't deny that the art team has is on point
                A lot of the art is super good, but doesn‚Äôt fit in terraria at all
                    I mean, Terraria‚Äôs art doesn‚Äôt fit Terraria. The game has such an inconsistent art style - compare the Empress of Light to the Eye of Cthulhu
                        I see it as the game‚Äôs style evolving, even the endgame tools have some level of consistency with the early sprites. On the other hand Calamity feels like art assets for a totally different game, it‚Äôs UI doesn‚Äôt match at all and the tools feel like generic fantasy garbage with weird shapes that make no sense mixed between weapons that would likely kill it‚Äôs own user realistically
                            Ah true enough. The arts great but if we‚Äôre talking practicality it‚Äôs also very bizarre yeah
        [deleted]
            No, I didn't even know about anything involving this prior to this thread. When I played/kept up with calamity it was well over a year ago. So stuff prior to that, even lol.
Calamity players try not to complain about slight changes challenge!!!!

If it‚Äôs that bad, why don‚Äôt you download an infinite flight mod instead of complaining?
    I don't see why you're here to run defense. I just think it's anti-fun design.
    Shockingly, people are allowed to provide feedback on things that they don‚Äôt like. 

That is part of the design process. Get over it.
Yharon lore no longer does anything, so only Insignia gives infinite flight before cal nerfed it
    Yeah the lore items got their abilities removed because why let the players have fun?
        I mean in hindsight, the lore items were weird and had weird effects for the most part, just a select few had op stuff with them.
            Plus, they took up tons of inventory space.
            Well yeah and then probably the reason why shyguymask was able to complete post-ml calamity without movement keys (wasd, other stuff was allowed) was because of the slime god lore item which now does nothing
        Keeping random lore items in your inventory for effects isn‚Äôt ‚Äúfun‚Äù
            They had effects but the devs removed the effects
                I know? I‚Äôm saying that those items were a weird concept in the first place.
                    Oops I didnt read the part where you talked about the effects lol
                    Functionally the same as charms in diablo, but yes they did clutter the inventory.
It gives just longer flight time
    Man, doesn't seem worth it when it already seems like players never land anyways.
        Exactly, so why make that problem even worse?
>the changes they made to the insignia mean it's still powerful

Nah, the changes have made it basically useless because it takes the very precious accessory slot and doesnt combine into anything. Furgermore Calamity accessories are already incredibly busted by themselves; its hard to think about Soaring Insignia as OP when things like The Sponge exist.
    it'd be cool if they could make it combine into something, i wonder if that's in the plans for later on.

calamity accessories become extremely powerful yeah, but you have to remember that The Sponge is really quite lategame, compared to the soaring insignia which in calamity can technically be obtained at the start of hardmode. i also don't think it's out of the ordinary to dedicate an accessory slot to powerful movement boosts. also worth considering that calamity just flat out buffs wings as a whole.
It'd probably be odd to not see those swords in the swinging animation though
    Yeah and they'd probably be a real pain to try and add
    I don‚Äôt think all the swords are in the original zenith animation. Maybe I just wasn‚Äôt paying attention but I see like 5 different ones.
        They're all there according to the wiki, it can be hard to notice some of them.
or they nerf it into oblivion and add a "true zenith"
My guess is that they will. This update was just to make the mod functional in 1.4, not to integrate it fully. The changes listed above are mostly things they can knock out quickly / things that'd be major flaws (for example, zenith would crush every boss before its last few without the tier shift).
they made a public announcement that regardless of if whips fits there idea of how summoner should be played or not, they would keep whips mostly as they are and add new whips to make it a viable option all troughout a playtrough.

and since they were already adding new "semi-active" weapons for summoners, I'm willing to bet that they do like whips.
Can't they just increase base damage?
    Its low base damage but high hit rate and armor piercing are its entire point. If you were to just buff its damage, you would go against what it's supposed to be.
        A percentage boost would change nothing about the hit rate or armor piercing. What's so bad about buffing the damage to stay at a similar dps? Does the identity matter when it's solely tied to dps.
Our only saviour
How will you name it ? When will it be available ?
    I think they mean they're also waiting
        Bruh, I'm fucking sad rn

            if i get invested enough i could eventually make it but someone will 100% beat me to it
        Goodluck learning C++üíÄ
            It's C# actually.
                Tmodloader is in C++, terraria is C# iirc
                    The tModLoader library is C#, and the large majority of the code in tModLoader is C#
 zenith is now post yahron 

And most damage reduction accessories and potions are nerfed
    tbf zenith should be the final melee weapon. i have no idea how they implemented it but i hope it's upgraded with some of the calamity aesthetic/weapons
        [deleted]
            FFIV rydia, summoners first appeared in FFIII, but you're point still stands lmao
                Waaaay back when, FFIV used to be called FFII due to the other games not being released in english.
        no, ark of the cosmos should be the final
            No, ark of the covenant. It gets a bonus if used with Indiana Jones‚Äô whip.
    zenith got insane times for a post-ml weapon on scal. it was on par with post-yharon weapons if not a little worse. though they could've kept it post-ml but nerfed it, and added upgrades to it, but i guess they went the lazy way

idk how to feel about the other changes though
        IIRC, this version was simply designed to come out as quickly as it could, so they took the ‚Äúminimum dev-time‚Äù approach to pretty much everything 1.4-related. We‚Äôll need to wait for a real update to see what their plans are for Zenith and other stuff
    Zenith should be post yharon lol. It's kind of ridiculous even against Scal and exo mechs
Soaring insignia only gives increased flight time
    bruh...
        Wdym bruh its existence completely destroys the balance of all post moon lord mods including calamity
    Didn't expect anything else. It was the most busted item in 1.4.
I think most of Calamity takes place after vanilla end game, so now vanilla endgame was extended in 1.4 to include broken weapons which dont need to be balanced in vanilla because you've already won when you get them, but in Calamity then need to be balanced for the upcoming content.
Vanilla put in insanely overpowered weapons so because there are no post moonlord bosses and it completely throws off the balance of Calamity. If they didn‚Äôt nerf the vanilla weapons probably about half of the post moonlord content in Calimity would have to be reworked completely
Nah it's more stupid , it's to make the game harder 

They gave damage reduction a soft cap , but it was so easy to reach with just few accessories and some potions , so to fix it they nerfed the damage reduction of said accessories and potions 

Also many items were nerfed to add a new "stage" to the game , for example I found post plantera weapons to be much weaker than vanilla , which forced me to fight another boss before Golem and the cultist

 ( have to say that the last version of calamity I've played was rust and dust , so my information might be outdated )
    I'm all in favor of an actual stage between plantera and golem though. It was always a letdown beating plantera for the first time, going into the temple, and immediately beating golem easily in vanilla.

Most of the nerfs are because in vanilla, everything after the Moonlord can just be awesome and fun and needs no balancing. In Calamity there's a ton of stuff after Moonlord and the vanilla items in 1.4 completely wreck that without nerfs.
Didn't they change the whips damage tags from flat damage to % damage to? Meaning that the blade staff is kinda ass now
    they said they would rework it. not sure if they did though
It's amazing how the first thing you said was "nerfing" and not "adding", that shows how much calamity devs hate fun
    Well, I mean, calamity wasn't made with whips in mind. It's either they nerf whips, nerf summons, or buff literally everything else.

And since there are probably less whips than summons, it makes sense that they would nerf whips.
        A lot of people ITT are really uppity about the concept of anything getting a nerf, even if it has the potential of completely busting the entire game through one class.
            At the end of the day if you grind enough things or find tricks in Terraria such as building perfect combat arenas and reforging for whatever you need in a fight, you can sort of cheese some bosses. That usually opens doors to progress much faster, and it's normally a part of the game. 

If you use goblin spikes to crush EoW then you get his drops and then it's easier to kill the other start-of-game bosses, for example. Building an arena with teleportation for Plantera underground... etc.

So instead of planned tricks you could use a weapon that is unusually strong early like Scourge of the Corruptor. Or even both the tricks and the weapons. 

But with the nerfs you *must* grind and perfect every arena because at the end of the day, it's more fun to fight when the boss' bullshit is matched or out-matched by the bullshit we build to deal with them. So the end result is... preparation takes more time - you need to grind more. And that's not always fun.
                I think everything you've said is fair. I even think Calamity is way overtuned on boss difficulty and either the endgame bosses need a nerf or endgame gear needs a buff. I just find a lot of people think nerfing is universally unacceptable, even if it would be both simpler and cleaner to just nerf some things.
                    I agree, sometimes nerfing is the best way about it. 

In this case it's easy to argue against a modder nerfing something that is a part of the base-game though. (why didn't he balance around it like everyone else? why does it even need nerfing when it was accepted in the base game and by other mods? why not just accept that some things may perform better than others instead of nit-picking? and so on)
                        I'd say that, except all of these things in Calamity were made BEFORE the new additions of vanilla 1.4.

So either...

1.  Calamity has to completely re-design it's endgame around the new numbers and potential of base game.

Or

2. Calamity nerfs the numbers/adjust the time of obtaining of a few of the new items.
    Not defending Fabsol, but adding whips in a 1.4 port patch wouldn‚Äôt make sense anyway. iirc other devs promised to add new whips later on so that‚Äôs good
don't forget malice mode for extra suffering
    Also masochist mode form fargo's
        then we turn that mob spawnrate *aaaaaaall* the way up!
        Sadly Malice (or death) mode + eternity mode is impossible to complete. This is entirely due to Golem having conflicting mechanics that make him invincible to all damage in phase 2 when both are active. Every other boss is possible to beat with both modes activated. Skeletron Prime is another hard one, since you'll only be able to hit it for 1 damage every single attack, but still theoretically possible.
            Imagine fucking *GOLEM* ending your challenge playthrough that shit's just so funny to me
            This is actually possible because you can get the Eidolon Tablet which summons Lunatic Cultist. Eidolists that drop this item, spawn in 3rd layer of Abyss and start appearing after Wall of Flesh has been defeated.
Or‚Ä¶ hear me out‚Ä¶ Master Mode with 10x spawns.
    And every enemy is a Draedon Mech
        Playing the game the way god intended
            God? I don't think so, but how that son of a bitch fabsol intended? Definitely 

(Still really salty about everything)
Is there any mod which ads a hotkey for research (simple research was unbalanced last time I checked due to lack of crafting table check)
    they might have fixed that, i've had no issue with simple research. just hit one button and everything researchable in yer inventory is gobbled up.  and it also has a research hotkey as well.
    there's a mod that allows you to research the entire inventory at once if available, I can't remember the name though.
[removed]
    ü§ì
And then they pee their pants and whine when you use a qol mod. Well mostly Fabsol from what I've heard but nobody there has publicly disagreed.
Journey mode has automatic support with modded items. Just you wait
Isn't to low for fabsol from what I've seen
Trailer shows Journey mode
The only unresearchable ones are Schematics (supposed to be unique) and like what, Boss Rush drop? And Journey isn‚Äôt nerfed. I hope this doesn‚Äôt change because Fabsol can he like that but things are fine so far
    That's good news, hopefully it stays that way. You're definitely right about him being the type to change it. If Alchemist NPC is cheating to him, journey mode is absolutely cheating.
Thankfully there is always cheat sheet and hero's mod to fix that.
    thank god, for not ruining our only way of finishing malice mode king slime
        Is it that bad?
That isn't new. Even before 1.4 DoG and Providence could deal with cheat sheet's godmode
It's a known thing that in the modding community alot of people use smaller content mods alongside calamity , then shit talk about smaller content mods for falling behind and items being too weak
    That's the thing I like the least about Calamity players, they act like it's part of Vanilla Terraria and not a mod, and constantly shit on everyone who doesn't balance things around Calamity, instead of... y'know, Terraria.
        This is why I kind of prefer not using Calamity. The only real loss is the end-game bosses, all the way up to that the other mods are very nice... and Calamity breaks the early-game's balance and vanilla tricks.
        If anything, Thorium should be the mod to balance around.
            I still don't understand how Calamity is more popular than Thorium. After playing both, I feel like Thorium is the better mod. It integrates with the base game much better.
                Most popular things rarely are objectively best.
                    Popular things are the those which are advertised the most, like RLCraft from minecraft.
                    Well I wouldn‚Äôt say ‚Äúobjectively best‚Äù, but yeah Thorium is better (even if it doesn‚Äôt the rogue class, but that‚Äôs easily surpassed by techniques).
                Calamity: MODDED terraria 

Thorium: modded TERRARIA
            Didn't Thorium used to be like... really bad? or am I thinking of a different one
                No no, you are thinking of tremor.

Thorium is the golden classic one.
                    You're totally right, I am thinking of Tremor.
                    Oh god, Tremor, I forgot that happened. Thorium is pretty fun though.
        To be fair, they did nerf everything down in their last major update to have things balanced around vanilla (Murasama went from 20000 to 3000 for instance). Their endgame is still more OP than other mod endgames, but it means it's much safer to use Calamity weapons with other mods during certain points of progression.
    Ah okay ty.
I would assume they mean that a lot of people will just go straight to playing calamity again rather than try other mods, which isnt good for mods without large fanbases. Also calamity is pretty much incompatable with tmod itself lmao.
    Nah did a playthrough while waiting for calamity to update, now gonna do a playthrough of calamity lol,

Really interested in the changes to summoner again, haven't been in the discord
        Happy cake day!
Calamity is the largest mod
Currently they‚Äôre still working on tons of balance changes to pretty much every aspect of the game, as well as implenting 1.4 features (pylons, whips, etc) to fit with calamity‚Äôs new biomes and further progression. They just released it now so that the community could play it and report bugs and issues to make it an even better experience in the future
    TRUE i was just gonna say its most likely just a port to tml 1.4 rather than new content but still i feel like they could delay it a little to add a bit more content and incentive to play it more. however im not a dev so i wouldn't know
        I don't follow modding stuff so might be wrong but I believe they did a poll asking if people would prefer they delay it until more content is added or release early so people can play with it, and most people voted for early release so that's what they did.
        for people who were still playing 1.3 calamity, this update DOES add new content: 1.4's content
        Dude it‚Äôs free lol
            just cause its free doesn't mean its good or free from any ounce of criticism
                Thinking it‚Äôs good is irrelevant. Complaining about the lack of content (if it‚Äôs so good that you want more) is dumb when it‚Äôs free and in the works
Isn't the main point of the port to get update from Calamity though? As in being able to play existing Calamity mod on 1.4.
Man, people will complain about anything these days. What do you mean "rushed as hell"? 
 

 Not gonna lie, it kinda sounds like you are used to dealing with actual games getting rushed, like Cyberpunk. 
 
 
Calamity isn't a full game where the devs made a promise, took money, and failed to deliver on that promise and released an unfinished game. This is a mod with a fully playable version that is completely free, and they just happened to give people access to a newer version they are working on.
 
 
And if I come across as a dick here, it's because I really appreciate the crazy amount of work the devs put into Calamity, and it just blows my mind that someone who is able to play it completely free can complain about it like this. It just feels so entitled.
I mean I would accept a 1.4 version even if it didn't have any major changes
Well the guy responsible for the incredible soundtrack left because players were sending death threats. So it's unlikely he's ever part of any calamity project ever again.
    Holy shit man, WTF is wrong with people? You'd want to have an extremely empty life to do something like that.
it's been the logo for calamity for like 4 years, back when the mod was trying very hard to be edgy
What version of calamity has an issue with world gen?
    1.4 calamity, dont worry your 1.3 stuff will remain
        Can you explain to me how to do that or link me something?
            np chief, to transfer your worlds from 1.3 to 1.4 you need to activate the 1.4 version, Doing that is very simple as you just need to right click the config button on the tmodloader at your library, Then click properties and betas, Then select none to go to 1.4, From there onward you need to click on "transfer worlds" on world creation, Then select your Map and Voila! your world should supposed to be transfered, but if dont, then just continue playing on 1.3 or wait to the devs to fix the 1.4 issue
                Got it thanks a bunch üôè
                    no problem chief, always happy to help somebody
I second this, AlcNPC is a bit broken but lite is ok. The "infinite mana" thing got me to uninstall it post ML.
Personally i am not a fan of lite, lite causes all the potions to cost like 90 gold at all times and god forbid you try to buy a modded potion.
makes sense tho, but also just use The alchemist npc( not the mod name but the npc) beach teleporter, or just walk
You've given him the idea, now.
best possible choice they could have done tbh. It'd suck to see Zenith doing 3k damage for being such an amazing weapon concept lol.
    From what was shown in a video, it dealt same amount of damage as pre-DoG weapons, but they moved it post-DoG. Apart from its insanely good attack animation, its actually worse than other post-DoG melee weapons damage wise.
        It kinda fucking deletes the exo mechs and Scal so idk.
            It doesn't delete them, far from it. The dps was similar to a DoG weapon. The main advantage was its animation. It passes through blocks and requires no aiming. So, basically it has 100% uptime.
[deleted]
    I'd imagine the various accessories and armor you get leading up to Zenith in Calamity would have made it more OP. Base game Zenith was never intended to be balanced after all.
        For people that haven't played Calamity, pretty much every class in the game gets a set of accessories that scale in power as the player progresses w/ new tiers that can be crafted as new materials become available. It's sorta like the power glove line for melee except every class gets something similar. 

Also I'm doubting it, but would the Zenith count as true melee? Because sweet baby jesus that'd be sick w/ all the accessories that buff true melee.
            I think it would and is then the reason it gets pushed to post Yharon
            I mean technically speaking it's true melee, you just happen to be chucking the sword at the enemy faster and from further away. You are still *technically* hitting them with the main part of the sword(s). From a gameplay standpoint? No way in hell it would be true melee.
    Litetally shredding exo-mechs and scal.
    it is
    i mean it for a post moon lord weapon that was auric telsa tier of course they would have to make it post yharon other than that some of the other stuff they nerfed was stupid
    prolly made it that op
Okie doki! ü•õ
I suppose, but I‚Äôve heard about a lot of unnecessary changes that do nothing but ruin a lot of people‚Äôs fun? Idk
Yeah, it‚Äôs already insanely hard, so I don‚Äôt get why the developers are trying to make it harder? It seemed like one of em cared more about making a hard mod than a fun mod to play- in my experience, If your changes to the game ruin the fun of it, that‚Äôs a pretty bad choice. Fargo‚Äôs is pretty good with this, as you do have to be good at the game to get through bosses, but you feel accomplished doing it instead of just pissed off by the end and wanting it over with- even if the mech bosses are getting to that point with how hard it is to see their tells
Calamity is a mediocre mod. Zenith should be located Post-Providence, as it deals around that level of DPS. Sure, it obliterates Polterghast, but it would do nothing to the Exo-Mechs or SCal. The content is not actually that high quality, Starlight River will be a content mod of similar size, which DOESN‚ÄôT nerf or move existing items, and will also add super high quality content. The Stars Above isn‚Äôt as big as Calamity, but it is much higher quality and doesn‚Äôt rebalance vanilla. Spirit, Split, Endless Escapade, Ancients Awakened, and many more are way better than Calamity.
    You have no idea what you are talking about. When you use on tier gear and zenith, it destroys exo mechs and SCal. Most of calamity's nerfs and moves are needed as vanilla is kind of broken. The quality of the other mods are completely subjective. Calamity may not have the best visuals out there, but they're not bad. Plus, the fights and difficulty is great.
Continuously they make baffling changes, harass their users and add complicated garbage, all while slowly wringing fun out of the old good content.
    The problem is that fabsol has a specific vision for how he wants his mod to be played and nobody is allowed to disagree, but a majority of players don't agree with how fabsol wants the mod to be played.
        Fabsol uses she/her pronouns.
    I don‚Äôt have much of an issue with where the mod is rn, I think it‚Äôs fun.

Fabsiol can fuck right off though
    the fuck are you talking about?? define complicated garbage
Fuck... I didn't need to be reminded lol

i just like killing gods and the abyss and stuff
    I just like it's support with the Stars Above mod

tl;dr i like killing gods with weapons obtained from killing gods. And star godess but that's beside the point
        I too like the star waifus
        Playing Calamity can be really stressful, and having a cute star lady occasionally show up to tell me that I'm doing great really helps alleviate that.
MEMORIES BROKEN INTENSIFIES (I hear boss music \m/)
I think its mostly due to misinformation about fabsol and the devs


Yea fabsol can be kind of a dick but i dont think he even uses reddit and also not all of the devs act like fabsol
I never got the hate with calamity being balanced around itself when Ancients awakened dragon superboss takes 1 damage from every weapon that isnt AA or vanilla
    Calamity balancing the rest of the game around itself kills its compatibility with basically every other mod that doesnt specifically allow for clamity compatability.
        yes but AA just did that but worse, with the superboss basically forcing you to use AA weapons only
            I never said that aa wasnt bad
    i think a lot people use calamity's vast popularity as an excuse to quite frankly be assholes about it, for lack of better word.
        Ye, its kinda people being mad at people who like charizard from pokemon despite it being overrated, like The Big mac has a place in the table for a reason, plus its not like Calamity being installed makes you unable to play other mods
People complaining that those making free content aren't making the free content exactly the way they want. 

Newsflash: calamity isn't a democracy or a publicly traded company who answers to anyone. They make the mod they want to make. If you don't like it or don't like the developers, then don't play it and don't support it. Make your own mod instead, and when it's inevitably crap, and you have a bunch of mouth breathers whining about every decision you make, you'll might emphasize.
    Here before you get called an alt lmao
        Probably, don't work on calamity or Terraria mods, but I am a game developer myself. I can't imagine working for free, for a bunch of freeloaders to whine and whinge about every decision I make. I'd tell them to go fuck themselves, too.
            yep, this is pretty much exactly how i feel on the matter. i sympathize with the devs and i hope this recent wave of needless toxicity isn't affecting them too heavily.

this is a great mod, no i don't necessarily agree with the way it does some things, but there are always better ways to discuss these things. raging and bashing won't convince the devs, if anything it'll probably do the opposite. that's how passion projects work
Fab has twitter?
i get not liking fab he can be kind of a dick sometimes but jesus calm down
    i dont think he even has a twitter god damn people on reddit will believe literally anything you tell them at face value if it allows them to circlejerk
Mage is so fun, you're so ridiculously powerful yet you're made of essentially glass
    hell yea who doesnt love a good ol glass cannon
Well because smaller mods were easier to port over/ easier to create with the new update, it made it so those were the first mods available for 1.4. People wanted to play 1.4 modded but didn't have access to older mods, so it allowed people to branch out in ways they maybe wouldn't if major mods were still available. So now that more major mods are started to get ported, there's gonna be a drop in people checking out smaller mods.
But now everyone who was making do with the smaller mods and enjoying them while calamity was being ported now get shoved from the limelight they have had eluded from them for so long

        He kinda made a bunch of alts to defend himself with on that sub specifically soo... he kinda did have something to do on there. He also constantly told people they should play a certain kind of way (without nurse exploit, without the alchemy mod etc.) and called people trash if they didn't play the mod as he intended.

edit: r/calamitymod_ even has a rule saying that telling others to "get good" is a bannable offense so yea. I think that might be referring to his actions.

edit: apparently the get good rule wasn't inspired by our favorite toxic dev, and the alts were of some other salty kid. Sry for that, other stuff is accurate thou
            as a mod of the new subreddit, fabsol had nothing to do with the original subreddit, the alts were made by some toxic kid and we were sent proof of it. the get good rule is unrelated
                Dang. Oh well, thx for clarification and sorry for misinformation.
                    U should add another edit on your original comment saying it‚Äôs untrue if you‚Äôre really sorry :v
                        People don't really care about what the truth is, they just like to have excuses to blame people they don't like :)

that's a nice argument, Senator, why don't you back it up with a source?
                It happened, trust me.

[...like, unironically.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CalamityMod/comments/v59ub6/fabsol_trying_to_not_be_a_jerk_challenge/) Here's the [image](https://i.redd.it/olxg1vuyur391.jpg) the post came with.
                    Although there is proof of him being a jackass there is none of him using alts.
                        Multiple accounts a few days old defending him? (as in the ONLY accounts defending him?) If this isn't enough proof for you, you're experiencing mental disociation.
                            Weird you wanna say im disassociating because there is no proof. You are almost as toxic as he is in those screenshots. If you think alts repeating what he said verbatim is proof or evidence I would recommend that you not be any profession like a police officer or lawyer. Would not make a great fit. If you have any way to link it back to him and not trolls or people just trying to stir the pot or add fuel to the fire be my guest and I will eat my words.

because fuck you in particular, apparently
reddit moment
Calamity multiplayer lol.
Isnt summoner already op in calamity? the "nerfs" to the whips are still a power increase to an already strong class
Thing is, I know that. I've been a patron of the mod since 2019. It hurts seeing the names of these people I know get trashed for behavior that they really don't exhibit.
    yea sadly thats reddit for yea
but I thought they'll stop updating the forum link?
It was like that in 1.3 as well
he did not once say they werent allowed to dislike the mod, literally just making an observation
ye the dude dao apparently has a hateboner, but apparently Fabsol is the big bad guys he doesnt let us use qol mods even tho i can play just fine with alchemist npc lite and Luiafk
Fargos also doesn't fit the game lol
    Fargo reworks all bosses and makes them challenging yet an actually fun experience rather than a bullet sponge + high damage, sure the forces and shit are strange (yet cool, you can literally stop time) but other than that it‚Äôs a super vanilla mod
just use the texture pack, 1.4 has a support for texture packs and its far more easier to do now
There's a difference between having an opinion and being an asshole who has to shout it from the rooftops at every available opportunity. When a new Justin Beiber song releases, do I go to that community to tell them it's shit? When a YouTuber I don't like uploads a new video, am I there ASAP to post that they're fat/ugly and their video sucks? Do I ask everyone who buys an iPhone why they're okay being treated like a child in regard to how they're allowed to use it after spending $1000? Do I walk into people's houses and tell them their house looks like it was furnished/decorated by a broke, blind 95-year-old?

No because it's none of my business. I didn't pay money for any of these things, and nobody gives a rat's ass about my opinion, no matter how factually correct I may consider my opinion to be. If you go out of your way to spew negativity for something that you didn't pay for and doesn't concern you, then you are in fact an asshole.
theres definitely more, both Calamitas fights, a Provi attack, a Yharon attack and now Rev+ EOL ig
I've been playing with Stars Above and Calamity in 1.3, they work pretty well together and Stars Above even makes commentary on Calamity stuff.
They don't seem to be working alongside at this moment. Tried to load them, only 1 works at a time.
Calamity is too bloated to run with other mods.
    I tried running it with thorium, the 32-bit memory limit meant I ran out of memory often. Tmod has never been as unstable as it was then. I picked calamity over thorium
        why you playing calamity with thorium tho, Like these two are like mentos and cocacola, never be put together
            I had read somewhere that the special ocean of biome of thorium was chosen on the opposite side of the abyss specifically to let it be used with calamity. I also saw a video where someone was playing both together. I don't know much about thorium, but it didn't grab me like calamity did.
                yeah but like thorium is severely underpowered compared to calamity, if you want a mod that goes well with calamity play the stars above
yeah, it is
    calamity devs hate fun in general
        you don‚Äôt enjoy dozens of bullet bell boss fights with .1%  chance of dropping the item you want that becomes completely useless once you beat the next boss?
            wait till calamity loot swap comes in, or Better yet just get alchemist npc Operator and a shitton of platinum and buy the bags
                Calamity devs on their way to make the mod uncompatible with Alchemist NPC and many other QoL mods
                    Bam, re compatibility patch specifically that requires calamity and alchemist  or whatever mod so MAKE it compatible again.
                    dont give them ideias
            The 1% drops get stronger the further you get into the game so the weapons don‚Äôt fall off too fast.
                That's *ooooooold* Calamity, man. Legendary drops haven't scaled in *YEARS*.
                    Wait so halibut cannon used to get better, does it not now?
                        Halibut still does. All the other old legendaries like Aegis Blade, Blossom Flux, etc. don't anymore (and in my opinion, they're in the least creative and most unrewarding state they've ever been in).
        They pander to try hards and masochists, have you seen the levels in difficulty they added
            brother if you think a higher level of difficulty thats basically a way superior master mode without being simply damage buffs to enemies means its for masochist then look at master mode for the worthy hardcore no wasd copper shortsword only
        Calamity devs had a very different idea of fun a few years ago. Maybe Dokuro stepping down messed with Drew in some way, but the mod took a huge turn for the lame in the past few updates.
        [removed]
            [removed]
        yeah thats why there are countless QOL changes that make the game more fun then i spose
        Not every mod is tailored to your play style. Making dumbass statements like that reflects poorly on yourself, I'd recommend avoiding that in the future.
            Chill brother, I like playing Calamity but it's undeniable that the devs make some questionable decisions regarding fun. Don't know why you got all offended about it though. You don't need to be so protective of a terraria mod lmao.
                Not every mod is tailored to your play style. Making dumbass statements like that reflects poorly on yourself, I'd recommend avoiding that in the future.

            Is this a Fabsol alt?
            not happ'n'n
exactly, there's no reason to nerf Soaring Insignia
    The primary effect of it isnt even the infinite flight, its the DOUBLED vertical acceleration which is mad. Infinite flight is pretty good but if youre good with your hook its not a game changer but pretty good, to be fair the item was over-nerfed but it was busted before with the unopposed flight mobility.
Doing God's work bro üôè
Not really, if you set up the new accessory with weird loopholes like +9999 flight time instead of flightTime = max (i haven't worked with flight time so excuse my ignorance if this is wrong)
    I don't use flight time at all, there is a parameter called empressBrooch that I just set to true.But Calamity overrides that exact parameter so I'll just set flight time to max or a really high value with a config if someone likes the calamity nerf
        Ah that would make sense. I think you could just have the accessory have that max time you're talking about, since the rocket boots add to the flight time of wings, so it makes sense for other accessories to increase the flight time as eell
What is your mod
antisocial is so good if you wanna have more accesory slots, but you might think its cheaty

Damn, I feel the stuck-upness through the screen, ESPECIALLY from a guy, whose half of ideas consists of stealing everything possible from MGR:R (one-off references are okay, but when your most powerful weapon is directly from that game without name changes, and you incorporate the absolutely not fitting health UI into Terraria, then it gets kinda suspect) and spongify vanilla bosses for "challenge"
    Fabsol seems like he's trying to take Calamity in two different directions at the same time. All of the MGR references are fun nods to (presumably) fab's favorite game, which he's totally allowed to do. It's literally his mod, after all. However, at the same time, he's trying to turn "Terraria" into "Calamity." The Health UI and boss AI changes definitely make it feel like Calamity is designed as its own experience, and while that's also totally okay, the way that "mod with a bunch of references made for fun" and "mod that's designed to overhaul your entire play experience" mix in Calamity is not done well. I personally love Calamity. I always have, and I play the shit out of it whenever I can, but it's definitely got its problems.
well i play with ore excavator, Alchemist, overhaul, ther content mods and Luiafk 

mainly because i suck at the game without these but that doesn‚Äôt matter
[deleted]
    They don't. QoL mods are unaffected, the nurse is disabled when a boss is alive solely when playing in Death mode, etc.
    they dont
    They don't.
dude nothing is stoping you from playing without those, alchemist npc is still usable and so is ore excavator
What's he gonna do about it?
    Nerf a bunch of things people found fun.
        he does that anyways
Calamity? Calamity is fine. Some well made, interesting content. But the devs hate any alternate way of playing the game other than their very firm vision and will work in nerfs to alternate playstyles. Hard. Hence soaring insignia being heavily nerfed.
    This whole Calamity thing reminds me of Gregtech drama from Minecraft's FeedtheBeast (FtB) mod packs way back in the day. 


Sorry for the long post.
TLDR; Greg liked Grind=Power and applied it to a ton popular mods in modpacks that included his Gregtech mod. Players didn't like having to spend a lot of time to get simple automation. Mod Creators had their own vision for their mod and didn't like him messing with it. It caused a lot of drama.


And now the post:
For those that don't know FtB mod packs were a bundle of minecraft mods that usually focused on factory building and industrialization. Think Factorio before Factorio existed.


One of the mods included was called Gregtech which was a mid-endgame expansion to the very popular Industrialcraft 2 mod.  Greg was the mod creator and had a mindset of working hard to earn powerful rewards. If you got to endgame with this mod it delivered on this vision with some ludicrously strong production, storage, sorting, and power generation.


The problem came in with the fact that Greg thought this mindset should be applied to all mods in a mod pack that included Gregtech and a lot of the popular modpacks had Gregtech included. Greg would adjust the recipes of machines from other mods to make them significantly more time consuming and expensive. For example a simple flint and steel went from 1 flint and 1 iron ingot to 1 flint and 1 steel ingot. A steel ingot required a few different machines to produce as opposed to iron only needing a furnace.


This irked a lot of players and mod creators. A good chunk of players didn't like the added grind to everything and the factory building part of the mod pack took significantly longer to both get to and build.  Mod creators were quite annoyed since they had their own vision of how their progression in their mod worked and communication with Greg was apparently frustrating.


Eventually the outcry got loud enough that the modpack creators split packs into a version that included Gregtech and one that didnt. Also mod creators were creating their own recipie "packs" that you could swap to in the config file and usually included a "Vanilla" version. Not entirely sure what happened after the split as shortly after that I stopped playing FtB for a while.
        Good explanation. However, instead of explaining all this you can just tell to anyone curious to play GT NH (GregTech: New Horizons) and it will be self-explanatory
            Thank you! This Calamity drama just kinda dug out a memory from like 9 years ago. I haven't played as much FtB or FtB styled modpacks in recent years and don't really know what Gregtech New Horizons is, but given who he is my guess is that it is months worth of grind with increasingly complex systems that end in you becoming some kind of industrial god.
                Cool to see someone who was around back then in the wild! I still remember playing RedPower and looking at the movable frames - it was like Create, years before Create
                    Yea man it was some good times. My friend group had a whole server running with the Ultimate pack and we had some fun coming up with factories that combined multiple mods into an amalgam of industry.
                        I loved that. Have you played modded Minecraft recently? Create: Above and Beyond was a great modpack (although endgame was kind of too math-ey for me)
        I haven't heard about calamities developers much but the sentiment here reminds me of Starbounds Frackin Universe dev and similar criticisms going towards him. He literally made an update to his mod that detected another mod that reverted a nerf he made to a certain planet type(making them useless to visit). In the code he made a line called ''Idiot Check'' which checks if people are using the mod, and essentially causes every weather effect to happen at the same time and kill the player.  He's had a history of doing other things in that ballpark but holy moly that was ridiculous.
    It's funny. As soon as I encountered the insignia when 1.4 came out my first thought regarding modded was "oh yeah, calamity is gonna make this useless"
    That, plus the artstyle/UI clashes (just some of the artstyle doesn't fit terraria at all), most bosses being either the souped-up versions of vanilla bosses or touhou-like bullet hells, and visual effect overload that only plummets performance on my laptop are the reasons why I didn't wind up playing Calamity
        THIS this right here. It's the attempts at re-writing the lore that get me the worst, the art looks like it belongs in Starbound instead of Terraria, and everything that the devs have written reads like something a 13 year old AOL roleplayer from the 90s wrote.
            At this point calamity feels like a diffrent game so I dont see a point complaining about it having a diffrent art style or weird lore.
            You mean, re-writting terraria's official, OPTIONAL, lore that's very basic and mediocre at best? Yeah, the lore is bad, but it's getting fixed to be better written, so this could all change. Terraria also got more and more detailed art style, see EoL. The art style is a matter of TASTES my dude. There are texture packs for a reason, and mods shouldn't be forced to cater to one artstyle as many mods don't. If the art style is to detailed and too complex for your liking, there are texture packs out there that could possibly change it all to look like earlier vanilla like sprites, or versely, if you just want consistency there is a mod that makes all the art of vanilla more detailed like cal.
        eh the only real bullet hell boss is SCal, and the effects are meh, the Radiance mod on the other hand, now ***that's*** a bullet hell with amazing effects, it turns EoL into a fucking brutal fight
            Tbh radiance feels much more fair, the bullethell is harder and you get oneshot, but you'll probably never feel like you were killed by a projectile you couldn't see, yellow on black makes it very clear what's going on, unlike scal (or yharon) where all projectiles are red, the enemy is red and there also is a heavy red filter makin everything else on screen red, so every moving thing on screen blends into a deep red mush.
                yeah for sure, SCal is a pain in the ass cuz you can't see the projectiles
        I will say the art think is subjective, and many mods do a similar thing too in their own way, plus there is a mod to retexture it to fit more with the art direction of cal, so. And touhou-like bosses aren't a bad thing. It's when they poorly designed bullet hails is when problems arise. The visual overload sounds like a device problem than the mod problem though. The vanilla style of boss is a matter of taste, so you have every right to not want to play it for you reasons. But I want to make sure the subjective is not phrased in a way that makes it come off objective. And to make things that ALL mods are guilty come to light. I hate this argument used against Cal when other bigger mods are also guilty of this, not just cal. Plus, who cares if the art style is different? Minecraft mods have done the same. and like Minecraft, terraria has texture pack options, so this isn't a real factor for not playing the mod imo. The way they handle their boss fights and how it effects other mods? Yeah, a more valid reason imo given that unlike artstyles that can be changed with texture packs, this is more skin deep than the latter. 

Also, as a laptop player myself, playing any mods with friends, I having a lot lags the game. Which is why I eventually plan to go PC to handle it.
            i hate when people blame calamity for not being balanced with other mods when other mods are doing that and dont get blamed, like ancients awakened( which is a worse calamity made by a even more terrible person) has it final boss take 1 damage if youre using weapons that arent AA or vanilla, so for example if youre playing with stars above and u use bury the light on the boss it only deals 1 damage
                That sucks, yet it seems we are in the minority as evident by my down vote and massive mindless up votes for the comment above. Yeah, most other mods don't even balance that well around vanilla either. A good portion do, but not all. And when you get serious like me and try to call this out or just talk respectful in general, you are: hated, down voted, memed on, rumor spread about you, trashed talked about you behind your back, so much more and become INFAMOUS among the internet like me.

I hate the online and irl to a extent. The world kind of sucks imo.
    May I ask what their vision is? Just deciding if ny playstyle fits
        The way to fight bosses is as close to no-hit as possible. Bosses tend towards screen filling bullet hells. Everything does absurd amounts of damage. You can get hit a few times, but defense is heavily nerfed, and flying/movement is actively nerfed in many fights. You're heavily rewarded for not getting hit at all in general.

Which you know, is fine! Some people like the pattern-learning style. But I don't like how they force it on people by crowbarring out every mechanic that threatens it or suddenly becomes unbalanced because it's good in their hyper specific world.
            Thank you I will give it a pass..... I am not the bewt at dodging so what you describe sounds like plain frustration to me.
                Nothing wrong with that. There are lots of excellent mods out there. It's worth giving it a try, since there is always adjustable difficulty. But I really don't like the design philosophy and have things I enjoy much more.
    Ah sounds exactly DE's intentions with warframe
    Yep, like nerfing basically how the Lava Charm and its other accessories worked in 1.3.? Luckily, you could turn that option off but, Idk if that still happens with 1.4.
    i really dont understand the uproar, the accesory is busted OP and would be even more so in Calamity where movement is even more vital. you want them to intentionally leave it unbalanced or what?
        Busted OP? I mean, you're allowed to have your opinion! I think that spending a whole accessory slot on movement should give you better movement. And more importantly, is this an uproar? I just gave my opinion.
            nah, the uproar wasnt yours i just meant people here in general. but it DOUBLES vertical acceleration. I think they did nerf it too much to the point where youre right and its barely worth using which is a bit of a shame though
    Surely you can play without it right? Plus it should be fine since the devs found it necessary for the vision of their creation right?
        I'm sure I can! I never said it was mandatory for playing or anything. Just that it's fun and the devs hate fun. It's a running theme for Calamity design decisions in my opinion.
[deleted]
Yeah, I really dislike the devs tbh. Calamity is absolutely fantastic, but they have made some pretty terrible decisions imo and on more than one occasion have been complete assholes about things when the community complains about it.
    I see it as a case of bad design, amazing execution. I don‚Äôt agree with all their decisions and I like terraria for it‚Äôs flexibility after all
         I feel like a lot of cal's content can be really bland or bullshitty at times, but you can't deny that the art team has is on point
            A lot of the art is super good, but doesn‚Äôt fit in terraria at all
                I mean, Terraria‚Äôs art doesn‚Äôt fit Terraria. The game has such an inconsistent art style - compare the Empress of Light to the Eye of Cthulhu
                    I see it as the game‚Äôs style evolving, even the endgame tools have some level of consistency with the early sprites. On the other hand Calamity feels like art assets for a totally different game, it‚Äôs UI doesn‚Äôt match at all and the tools feel like generic fantasy garbage with weird shapes that make no sense mixed between weapons that would likely kill it‚Äôs own user realistically
                        Ah true enough. The arts great but if we‚Äôre talking practicality it‚Äôs also very bizarre yeah
    [deleted]
        No, I didn't even know about anything involving this prior to this thread. When I played/kept up with calamity it was well over a year ago. So stuff prior to that, even lol.
I don't see why you're here to run defense. I just think it's anti-fun design.
Shockingly, people are allowed to provide feedback on things that they don‚Äôt like. 

That is part of the design process. Get over it.
Yeah the lore items got their abilities removed because why let the players have fun?
    I mean in hindsight, the lore items were weird and had weird effects for the most part, just a select few had op stuff with them.
        Plus, they took up tons of inventory space.
        Well yeah and then probably the reason why shyguymask was able to complete post-ml calamity without movement keys (wasd, other stuff was allowed) was because of the slime god lore item which now does nothing
    Keeping random lore items in your inventory for effects isn‚Äôt ‚Äúfun‚Äù
        They had effects but the devs removed the effects
            I know? I‚Äôm saying that those items were a weird concept in the first place.
                Oops I didnt read the part where you talked about the effects lol
                Functionally the same as charms in diablo, but yes they did clutter the inventory.
Man, doesn't seem worth it when it already seems like players never land anyways.
    Exactly, so why make that problem even worse?
it'd be cool if they could make it combine into something, i wonder if that's in the plans for later on.

calamity accessories become extremely powerful yeah, but you have to remember that The Sponge is really quite lategame, compared to the soaring insignia which in calamity can technically be obtained at the start of hardmode. i also don't think it's out of the ordinary to dedicate an accessory slot to powerful movement boosts. also worth considering that calamity just flat out buffs wings as a whole.
Yeah and they'd probably be a real pain to try and add
I don‚Äôt think all the swords are in the original zenith animation. Maybe I just wasn‚Äôt paying attention but I see like 5 different ones.
    They're all there according to the wiki, it can be hard to notice some of them.
Its low base damage but high hit rate and armor piercing are its entire point. If you were to just buff its damage, you would go against what it's supposed to be.
    A percentage boost would change nothing about the hit rate or armor piercing. What's so bad about buffing the damage to stay at a similar dps? Does the identity matter when it's solely tied to dps.
I think they mean they're also waiting
    Bruh, I'm fucking sad rn
        This dude has unwittingly declared himself the messiah

    Goodluck learning C++üíÄ
        It's C# actually.
            Tmodloader is in C++, terraria is C# iirc
                The tModLoader library is C#, and the large majority of the code in tModLoader is C#
tbf zenith should be the final melee weapon. i have no idea how they implemented it but i hope it's upgraded with some of the calamity aesthetic/weapons
    [deleted]
        FFIV rydia, summoners first appeared in FFIII, but you're point still stands lmao
            Waaaay back when, FFIV used to be called FFII due to the other games not being released in english.
    no, ark of the cosmos should be the final
        No, ark of the covenant. It gets a bonus if used with Indiana Jones‚Äô whip.
zenith got insane times for a post-ml weapon on scal. it was on par with post-yharon weapons if not a little worse. though they could've kept it post-ml but nerfed it, and added upgrades to it, but i guess they went the lazy way

idk how to feel about the other changes though
    IIRC, this version was simply designed to come out as quickly as it could, so they took the ‚Äúminimum dev-time‚Äù approach to pretty much everything 1.4-related. We‚Äôll need to wait for a real update to see what their plans are for Zenith and other stuff
Zenith should be post yharon lol. It's kind of ridiculous even against Scal and exo mechs
bruh...
    Wdym bruh its existence completely destroys the balance of all post moon lord mods including calamity
Didn't expect anything else. It was the most busted item in 1.4.
I'm all in favor of an actual stage between plantera and golem though. It was always a letdown beating plantera for the first time, going into the temple, and immediately beating golem easily in vanilla.

Most of the nerfs are because in vanilla, everything after the Moonlord can just be awesome and fun and needs no balancing. In Calamity there's a ton of stuff after Moonlord and the vanilla items in 1.4 completely wreck that without nerfs.
they said they would rework it. not sure if they did though
Well, I mean, calamity wasn't made with whips in mind. It's either they nerf whips, nerf summons, or buff literally everything else.

And since there are probably less whips than summons, it makes sense that they would nerf whips.
    A lot of people ITT are really uppity about the concept of anything getting a nerf, even if it has the potential of completely busting the entire game through one class.
        At the end of the day if you grind enough things or find tricks in Terraria such as building perfect combat arenas and reforging for whatever you need in a fight, you can sort of cheese some bosses. That usually opens doors to progress much faster, and it's normally a part of the game. 

If you use goblin spikes to crush EoW then you get his drops and then it's easier to kill the other start-of-game bosses, for example. Building an arena with teleportation for Plantera underground... etc.

So instead of planned tricks you could use a weapon that is unusually strong early like Scourge of the Corruptor. Or even both the tricks and the weapons. 

But with the nerfs you *must* grind and perfect every arena because at the end of the day, it's more fun to fight when the boss' bullshit is matched or out-matched by the bullshit we build to deal with them. So the end result is... preparation takes more time - you need to grind more. And that's not always fun.
            I think everything you've said is fair. I even think Calamity is way overtuned on boss difficulty and either the endgame bosses need a nerf or endgame gear needs a buff. I just find a lot of people think nerfing is universally unacceptable, even if it would be both simpler and cleaner to just nerf some things.
                I agree, sometimes nerfing is the best way about it. 

In this case it's easy to argue against a modder nerfing something that is a part of the base-game though. (why didn't he balance around it like everyone else? why does it even need nerfing when it was accepted in the base game and by other mods? why not just accept that some things may perform better than others instead of nit-picking? and so on)
                    I'd say that, except all of these things in Calamity were made BEFORE the new additions of vanilla 1.4.

So either...

1.  Calamity has to completely re-design it's endgame around the new numbers and potential of base game.

Or

2. Calamity nerfs the numbers/adjust the time of obtaining of a few of the new items.
Not defending Fabsol, but adding whips in a 1.4 port patch wouldn‚Äôt make sense anyway. iirc other devs promised to add new whips later on so that‚Äôs good
Also masochist mode form fargo's
    then we turn that mob spawnrate *aaaaaaall* the way up!
    Sadly Malice (or death) mode + eternity mode is impossible to complete. This is entirely due to Golem having conflicting mechanics that make him invincible to all damage in phase 2 when both are active. Every other boss is possible to beat with both modes activated. Skeletron Prime is another hard one, since you'll only be able to hit it for 1 damage every single attack, but still theoretically possible.
        Imagine fucking *GOLEM* ending your challenge playthrough that shit's just so funny to me
        This is actually possible because you can get the Eidolon Tablet which summons Lunatic Cultist. Eidolists that drop this item, spawn in 3rd layer of Abyss and start appearing after Wall of Flesh has been defeated.
And every enemy is a Draedon Mech
    Playing the game the way god intended
        God? I don't think so, but how that son of a bitch fabsol intended? Definitely 

(Still really salty about everything)
they might have fixed that, i've had no issue with simple research. just hit one button and everything researchable in yer inventory is gobbled up.  and it also has a research hotkey as well.
there's a mod that allows you to research the entire inventory at once if available, I can't remember the name though.

That's good news, hopefully it stays that way. You're definitely right about him being the type to change it. If Alchemist NPC is cheating to him, journey mode is absolutely cheating.
thank god, for not ruining our only way of finishing malice mode king slime
    Is it that bad?
That's the thing I like the least about Calamity players, they act like it's part of Vanilla Terraria and not a mod, and constantly shit on everyone who doesn't balance things around Calamity, instead of... y'know, Terraria.
    This is why I kind of prefer not using Calamity. The only real loss is the end-game bosses, all the way up to that the other mods are very nice... and Calamity breaks the early-game's balance and vanilla tricks.
    If anything, Thorium should be the mod to balance around.
        I still don't understand how Calamity is more popular than Thorium. After playing both, I feel like Thorium is the better mod. It integrates with the base game much better.
            Most popular things rarely are objectively best.
                Popular things are the those which are advertised the most, like RLCraft from minecraft.
                Well I wouldn‚Äôt say ‚Äúobjectively best‚Äù, but yeah Thorium is better (even if it doesn‚Äôt the rogue class, but that‚Äôs easily surpassed by techniques).
            Calamity: MODDED terraria 

Thorium: modded TERRARIA
        Didn't Thorium used to be like... really bad? or am I thinking of a different one
            No no, you are thinking of tremor.

Thorium is the golden classic one.
                You're totally right, I am thinking of Tremor.
                Oh god, Tremor, I forgot that happened. Thorium is pretty fun though.
    To be fair, they did nerf everything down in their last major update to have things balanced around vanilla (Murasama went from 20000 to 3000 for instance). Their endgame is still more OP than other mod endgames, but it means it's much safer to use Calamity weapons with other mods during certain points of progression.
Ah okay ty.
Nah did a playthrough while waiting for calamity to update, now gonna do a playthrough of calamity lol,

Really interested in the changes to summoner again, haven't been in the discord
    Happy cake day!
TRUE i was just gonna say its most likely just a port to tml 1.4 rather than new content but still i feel like they could delay it a little to add a bit more content and incentive to play it more. however im not a dev so i wouldn't know
    I don't follow modding stuff so might be wrong but I believe they did a poll asking if people would prefer they delay it until more content is added or release early so people can play with it, and most people voted for early release so that's what they did.
    for people who were still playing 1.3 calamity, this update DOES add new content: 1.4's content
    Dude it‚Äôs free lol
        just cause its free doesn't mean its good or free from any ounce of criticism
            Thinking it‚Äôs good is irrelevant. Complaining about the lack of content (if it‚Äôs so good that you want more) is dumb when it‚Äôs free and in the works
Holy shit man, WTF is wrong with people? You'd want to have an extremely empty life to do something like that.
1.4 calamity, dont worry your 1.3 stuff will remain
    Can you explain to me how to do that or link me something?
        np chief, to transfer your worlds from 1.3 to 1.4 you need to activate the 1.4 version, Doing that is very simple as you just need to right click the config button on the tmodloader at your library, Then click properties and betas, Then select none to go to 1.4, From there onward you need to click on "transfer worlds" on world creation, Then select your Map and Voila! your world should supposed to be transfered, but if dont, then just continue playing on 1.3 or wait to the devs to fix the 1.4 issue
            Got it thanks a bunch üôè
                no problem chief, always happy to help somebody
From what was shown in a video, it dealt same amount of damage as pre-DoG weapons, but they moved it post-DoG. Apart from its insanely good attack animation, its actually worse than other post-DoG melee weapons damage wise.
    It kinda fucking deletes the exo mechs and Scal so idk.
        It doesn't delete them, far from it. The dps was similar to a DoG weapon. The main advantage was its animation. It passes through blocks and requires no aiming. So, basically it has 100% uptime.
I'd imagine the various accessories and armor you get leading up to Zenith in Calamity would have made it more OP. Base game Zenith was never intended to be balanced after all.
    For people that haven't played Calamity, pretty much every class in the game gets a set of accessories that scale in power as the player progresses w/ new tiers that can be crafted as new materials become available. It's sorta like the power glove line for melee except every class gets something similar. 

Also I'm doubting it, but would the Zenith count as true melee? Because sweet baby jesus that'd be sick w/ all the accessories that buff true melee.
        I think it would and is then the reason it gets pushed to post Yharon
        I mean technically speaking it's true melee, you just happen to be chucking the sword at the enemy faster and from further away. You are still *technically* hitting them with the main part of the sword(s). From a gameplay standpoint? No way in hell it would be true melee.
Litetally shredding exo-mechs and scal.
it is
i mean it for a post moon lord weapon that was auric telsa tier of course they would have to make it post yharon other than that some of the other stuff they nerfed was stupid
prolly made it that op
You have no idea what you are talking about. When you use on tier gear and zenith, it destroys exo mechs and SCal. Most of calamity's nerfs and moves are needed as vanilla is kind of broken. The quality of the other mods are completely subjective. Calamity may not have the best visuals out there, but they're not bad. Plus, the fights and difficulty is great.
The problem is that fabsol has a specific vision for how he wants his mod to be played and nobody is allowed to disagree, but a majority of players don't agree with how fabsol wants the mod to be played.
    Fabsol uses she/her pronouns.
I don‚Äôt have much of an issue with where the mod is rn, I think it‚Äôs fun.

Fabsiol can fuck right off though
the fuck are you talking about?? define complicated garbage
Ultimate Lifeform
I just like it's support with the Stars Above mod

tl;dr i like killing gods with weapons obtained from killing gods. And star godess but that's beside the point
    I too like the star waifus
    Playing Calamity can be really stressful, and having a cute star lady occasionally show up to tell me that I'm doing great really helps alleviate that.
Calamity balancing the rest of the game around itself kills its compatibility with basically every other mod that doesnt specifically allow for clamity compatability.
    yes but AA just did that but worse, with the superboss basically forcing you to use AA weapons only
        I never said that aa wasnt bad
i think a lot people use calamity's vast popularity as an excuse to quite frankly be assholes about it, for lack of better word.
    Ye, its kinda people being mad at people who like charizard from pokemon despite it being overrated, like The Big mac has a place in the table for a reason, plus its not like Calamity being installed makes you unable to play other mods
Here before you get called an alt lmao
    Probably, don't work on calamity or Terraria mods, but I am a game developer myself. I can't imagine working for free, for a bunch of freeloaders to whine and whinge about every decision I make. I'd tell them to go fuck themselves, too.
        yep, this is pretty much exactly how i feel on the matter. i sympathize with the devs and i hope this recent wave of needless toxicity isn't affecting them too heavily.

this is a great mod, no i don't necessarily agree with the way it does some things, but there are always better ways to discuss these things. raging and bashing won't convince the devs, if anything it'll probably do the opposite. that's how passion projects work
i dont think he even has a twitter god damn people on reddit will believe literally anything you tell them at face value if it allows them to circlejerk
hell yea who doesnt love a good ol glass cannon
I wanna know more about this, do you have any sources I can read/watch?

    He kinda made a bunch of alts to defend himself with on that sub specifically soo... he kinda did have something to do on there. He also constantly told people they should play a certain kind of way (without nurse exploit, without the alchemy mod etc.) and called people trash if they didn't play the mod as he intended.

edit: r/calamitymod_ even has a rule saying that telling others to "get good" is a bannable offense so yea. I think that might be referring to his actions.

edit: apparently the get good rule wasn't inspired by our favorite toxic dev, and the alts were of some other salty kid. Sry for that, other stuff is accurate thou
        as a mod of the new subreddit, fabsol had nothing to do with the original subreddit, the alts were made by some toxic kid and we were sent proof of it. the get good rule is unrelated
            Dang. Oh well, thx for clarification and sorry for misinformation.
                U should add another edit on your original comment saying it‚Äôs untrue if you‚Äôre really sorry :v
                    People don't really care about what the truth is, they just like to have excuses to blame people they don't like :)

that's a nice argument, Senator, why don't you back it up with a source?
            It happened, trust me.

[...like, unironically.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CalamityMod/comments/v59ub6/fabsol_trying_to_not_be_a_jerk_challenge/) Here's the [image](https://i.redd.it/olxg1vuyur391.jpg) the post came with.
                Although there is proof of him being a jackass there is none of him using alts.
                    Multiple accounts a few days old defending him? (as in the ONLY accounts defending him?) If this isn't enough proof for you, you're experiencing mental disociation.
                        Weird you wanna say im disassociating because there is no proof. You are almost as toxic as he is in those screenshots. If you think alts repeating what he said verbatim is proof or evidence I would recommend that you not be any profession like a police officer or lawyer. Would not make a great fit. If you have any way to link it back to him and not trolls or people just trying to stir the pot or add fuel to the fire be my guest and I will eat my words.

yea sadly thats reddit for yea
Fargo reworks all bosses and makes them challenging yet an actually fun experience rather than a bullet sponge + high damage, sure the forces and shit are strange (yet cool, you can literally stop time) but other than that it‚Äôs a super vanilla mod
I tried running it with thorium, the 32-bit memory limit meant I ran out of memory often. Tmod has never been as unstable as it was then. I picked calamity over thorium
    why you playing calamity with thorium tho, Like these two are like mentos and cocacola, never be put together
        I had read somewhere that the special ocean of biome of thorium was chosen on the opposite side of the abyss specifically to let it be used with calamity. I also saw a video where someone was playing both together. I don't know much about thorium, but it didn't grab me like calamity did.
            yeah but like thorium is severely underpowered compared to calamity, if you want a mod that goes well with calamity play the stars above
calamity devs hate fun in general
    you don‚Äôt enjoy dozens of bullet bell boss fights with .1%  chance of dropping the item you want that becomes completely useless once you beat the next boss?
        wait till calamity loot swap comes in, or Better yet just get alchemist npc Operator and a shitton of platinum and buy the bags
            Calamity devs on their way to make the mod uncompatible with Alchemist NPC and many other QoL mods
                Bam, re compatibility patch specifically that requires calamity and alchemist  or whatever mod so MAKE it compatible again.
                dont give them ideias
        The 1% drops get stronger the further you get into the game so the weapons don‚Äôt fall off too fast.
            That's *ooooooold* Calamity, man. Legendary drops haven't scaled in *YEARS*.
                Wait so halibut cannon used to get better, does it not now?
                    Halibut still does. All the other old legendaries like Aegis Blade, Blossom Flux, etc. don't anymore (and in my opinion, they're in the least creative and most unrewarding state they've ever been in).
    They pander to try hards and masochists, have you seen the levels in difficulty they added
        brother if you think a higher level of difficulty thats basically a way superior master mode without being simply damage buffs to enemies means its for masochist then look at master mode for the worthy hardcore no wasd copper shortsword only
    Calamity devs had a very different idea of fun a few years ago. Maybe Dokuro stepping down messed with Drew in some way, but the mod took a huge turn for the lame in the past few updates.

        [removed]
    yeah thats why there are countless QOL changes that make the game more fun then i spose
    Not every mod is tailored to your play style. Making dumbass statements like that reflects poorly on yourself, I'd recommend avoiding that in the future.
        Chill brother, I like playing Calamity but it's undeniable that the devs make some questionable decisions regarding fun. Don't know why you got all offended about it though. You don't need to be so protective of a terraria mod lmao.

        Is this a Fabsol alt?
        not happ'n'n
The primary effect of it isnt even the infinite flight, its the DOUBLED vertical acceleration which is mad. Infinite flight is pretty good but if youre good with your hook its not a game changer but pretty good, to be fair the item was over-nerfed but it was busted before with the unopposed flight mobility.
I don't use flight time at all, there is a parameter called empressBrooch that I just set to true.But Calamity overrides that exact parameter so I'll just set flight time to max or a really high value with a config if someone likes the calamity nerf
    Ah that would make sense. I think you could just have the accessory have that max time you're talking about, since the rocket boots add to the flight time of wings, so it makes sense for other accessories to increase the flight time as eell
Ty mate.
Fabsol seems like he's trying to take Calamity in two different directions at the same time. All of the MGR references are fun nods to (presumably) fab's favorite game, which he's totally allowed to do. It's literally his mod, after all. However, at the same time, he's trying to turn "Terraria" into "Calamity." The Health UI and boss AI changes definitely make it feel like Calamity is designed as its own experience, and while that's also totally okay, the way that "mod with a bunch of references made for fun" and "mod that's designed to overhaul your entire play experience" mix in Calamity is not done well. I personally love Calamity. I always have, and I play the shit out of it whenever I can, but it's definitely got its problems.
They don't. QoL mods are unaffected, the nurse is disabled when a boss is alive solely when playing in Death mode, etc.
they dont
They don't.
Nerf a bunch of things people found fun.
    he does that anyways
This whole Calamity thing reminds me of Gregtech drama from Minecraft's FeedtheBeast (FtB) mod packs way back in the day. 


Sorry for the long post.
TLDR; Greg liked Grind=Power and applied it to a ton popular mods in modpacks that included his Gregtech mod. Players didn't like having to spend a lot of time to get simple automation. Mod Creators had their own vision for their mod and didn't like him messing with it. It caused a lot of drama.


And now the post:
For those that don't know FtB mod packs were a bundle of minecraft mods that usually focused on factory building and industrialization. Think Factorio before Factorio existed.


One of the mods included was called Gregtech which was a mid-endgame expansion to the very popular Industrialcraft 2 mod.  Greg was the mod creator and had a mindset of working hard to earn powerful rewards. If you got to endgame with this mod it delivered on this vision with some ludicrously strong production, storage, sorting, and power generation.


The problem came in with the fact that Greg thought this mindset should be applied to all mods in a mod pack that included Gregtech and a lot of the popular modpacks had Gregtech included. Greg would adjust the recipes of machines from other mods to make them significantly more time consuming and expensive. For example a simple flint and steel went from 1 flint and 1 iron ingot to 1 flint and 1 steel ingot. A steel ingot required a few different machines to produce as opposed to iron only needing a furnace.


This irked a lot of players and mod creators. A good chunk of players didn't like the added grind to everything and the factory building part of the mod pack took significantly longer to both get to and build.  Mod creators were quite annoyed since they had their own vision of how their progression in their mod worked and communication with Greg was apparently frustrating.


Eventually the outcry got loud enough that the modpack creators split packs into a version that included Gregtech and one that didnt. Also mod creators were creating their own recipie "packs" that you could swap to in the config file and usually included a "Vanilla" version. Not entirely sure what happened after the split as shortly after that I stopped playing FtB for a while.
    Good explanation. However, instead of explaining all this you can just tell to anyone curious to play GT NH (GregTech: New Horizons) and it will be self-explanatory
        Thank you! This Calamity drama just kinda dug out a memory from like 9 years ago. I haven't played as much FtB or FtB styled modpacks in recent years and don't really know what Gregtech New Horizons is, but given who he is my guess is that it is months worth of grind with increasingly complex systems that end in you becoming some kind of industrial god.
            Cool to see someone who was around back then in the wild! I still remember playing RedPower and looking at the movable frames - it was like Create, years before Create
                Yea man it was some good times. My friend group had a whole server running with the Ultimate pack and we had some fun coming up with factories that combined multiple mods into an amalgam of industry.
                    I loved that. Have you played modded Minecraft recently? Create: Above and Beyond was a great modpack (although endgame was kind of too math-ey for me)
    I haven't heard about calamities developers much but the sentiment here reminds me of Starbounds Frackin Universe dev and similar criticisms going towards him. He literally made an update to his mod that detected another mod that reverted a nerf he made to a certain planet type(making them useless to visit). In the code he made a line called ''Idiot Check'' which checks if people are using the mod, and essentially causes every weather effect to happen at the same time and kill the player.  He's had a history of doing other things in that ballpark but holy moly that was ridiculous.
It's funny. As soon as I encountered the insignia when 1.4 came out my first thought regarding modded was "oh yeah, calamity is gonna make this useless"
That, plus the artstyle/UI clashes (just some of the artstyle doesn't fit terraria at all), most bosses being either the souped-up versions of vanilla bosses or touhou-like bullet hells, and visual effect overload that only plummets performance on my laptop are the reasons why I didn't wind up playing Calamity
    THIS this right here. It's the attempts at re-writing the lore that get me the worst, the art looks like it belongs in Starbound instead of Terraria, and everything that the devs have written reads like something a 13 year old AOL roleplayer from the 90s wrote.
        At this point calamity feels like a diffrent game so I dont see a point complaining about it having a diffrent art style or weird lore.
        You mean, re-writting terraria's official, OPTIONAL, lore that's very basic and mediocre at best? Yeah, the lore is bad, but it's getting fixed to be better written, so this could all change. Terraria also got more and more detailed art style, see EoL. The art style is a matter of TASTES my dude. There are texture packs for a reason, and mods shouldn't be forced to cater to one artstyle as many mods don't. If the art style is to detailed and too complex for your liking, there are texture packs out there that could possibly change it all to look like earlier vanilla like sprites, or versely, if you just want consistency there is a mod that makes all the art of vanilla more detailed like cal.
    eh the only real bullet hell boss is SCal, and the effects are meh, the Radiance mod on the other hand, now ***that's*** a bullet hell with amazing effects, it turns EoL into a fucking brutal fight
        Tbh radiance feels much more fair, the bullethell is harder and you get oneshot, but you'll probably never feel like you were killed by a projectile you couldn't see, yellow on black makes it very clear what's going on, unlike scal (or yharon) where all projectiles are red, the enemy is red and there also is a heavy red filter makin everything else on screen red, so every moving thing on screen blends into a deep red mush.
            yeah for sure, SCal is a pain in the ass cuz you can't see the projectiles
    I will say the art think is subjective, and many mods do a similar thing too in their own way, plus there is a mod to retexture it to fit more with the art direction of cal, so. And touhou-like bosses aren't a bad thing. It's when they poorly designed bullet hails is when problems arise. The visual overload sounds like a device problem than the mod problem though. The vanilla style of boss is a matter of taste, so you have every right to not want to play it for you reasons. But I want to make sure the subjective is not phrased in a way that makes it come off objective. And to make things that ALL mods are guilty come to light. I hate this argument used against Cal when other bigger mods are also guilty of this, not just cal. Plus, who cares if the art style is different? Minecraft mods have done the same. and like Minecraft, terraria has texture pack options, so this isn't a real factor for not playing the mod imo. The way they handle their boss fights and how it effects other mods? Yeah, a more valid reason imo given that unlike artstyles that can be changed with texture packs, this is more skin deep than the latter. 

Also, as a laptop player myself, playing any mods with friends, I having a lot lags the game. Which is why I eventually plan to go PC to handle it.
        i hate when people blame calamity for not being balanced with other mods when other mods are doing that and dont get blamed, like ancients awakened( which is a worse calamity made by a even more terrible person) has it final boss take 1 damage if youre using weapons that arent AA or vanilla, so for example if youre playing with stars above and u use bury the light on the boss it only deals 1 damage
            That sucks, yet it seems we are in the minority as evident by my down vote and massive mindless up votes for the comment above. Yeah, most other mods don't even balance that well around vanilla either. A good portion do, but not all. And when you get serious like me and try to call this out or just talk respectful in general, you are: hated, down voted, memed on, rumor spread about you, trashed talked about you behind your back, so much more and become INFAMOUS among the internet like me.

I hate the online and irl to a extent. The world kind of sucks imo.
May I ask what their vision is? Just deciding if ny playstyle fits
    The way to fight bosses is as close to no-hit as possible. Bosses tend towards screen filling bullet hells. Everything does absurd amounts of damage. You can get hit a few times, but defense is heavily nerfed, and flying/movement is actively nerfed in many fights. You're heavily rewarded for not getting hit at all in general.

Which you know, is fine! Some people like the pattern-learning style. But I don't like how they force it on people by crowbarring out every mechanic that threatens it or suddenly becomes unbalanced because it's good in their hyper specific world.
        Thank you I will give it a pass..... I am not the bewt at dodging so what you describe sounds like plain frustration to me.
            Nothing wrong with that. There are lots of excellent mods out there. It's worth giving it a try, since there is always adjustable difficulty. But I really don't like the design philosophy and have things I enjoy much more.
Ah sounds exactly DE's intentions with warframe
Yep, like nerfing basically how the Lava Charm and its other accessories worked in 1.3.? Luckily, you could turn that option off but, Idk if that still happens with 1.4.
i really dont understand the uproar, the accesory is busted OP and would be even more so in Calamity where movement is even more vital. you want them to intentionally leave it unbalanced or what?
    Busted OP? I mean, you're allowed to have your opinion! I think that spending a whole accessory slot on movement should give you better movement. And more importantly, is this an uproar? I just gave my opinion.
        nah, the uproar wasnt yours i just meant people here in general. but it DOUBLES vertical acceleration. I think they did nerf it too much to the point where youre right and its barely worth using which is a bit of a shame though
Surely you can play without it right? Plus it should be fine since the devs found it necessary for the vision of their creation right?
    I'm sure I can! I never said it was mandatory for playing or anything. Just that it's fun and the devs hate fun. It's a running theme for Calamity design decisions in my opinion.
I see it as a case of bad design, amazing execution. I don‚Äôt agree with all their decisions and I like terraria for it‚Äôs flexibility after all
     I feel like a lot of cal's content can be really bland or bullshitty at times, but you can't deny that the art team has is on point
        A lot of the art is super good, but doesn‚Äôt fit in terraria at all
            I mean, Terraria‚Äôs art doesn‚Äôt fit Terraria. The game has such an inconsistent art style - compare the Empress of Light to the Eye of Cthulhu
                I see it as the game‚Äôs style evolving, even the endgame tools have some level of consistency with the early sprites. On the other hand Calamity feels like art assets for a totally different game, it‚Äôs UI doesn‚Äôt match at all and the tools feel like generic fantasy garbage with weird shapes that make no sense mixed between weapons that would likely kill it‚Äôs own user realistically
                    Ah true enough. The arts great but if we‚Äôre talking practicality it‚Äôs also very bizarre yeah
[deleted]
    No, I didn't even know about anything involving this prior to this thread. When I played/kept up with calamity it was well over a year ago. So stuff prior to that, even lol.
I mean in hindsight, the lore items were weird and had weird effects for the most part, just a select few had op stuff with them.
    Plus, they took up tons of inventory space.
    Well yeah and then probably the reason why shyguymask was able to complete post-ml calamity without movement keys (wasd, other stuff was allowed) was because of the slime god lore item which now does nothing
Keeping random lore items in your inventory for effects isn‚Äôt ‚Äúfun‚Äù
    They had effects but the devs removed the effects
        I know? I‚Äôm saying that those items were a weird concept in the first place.
            Oops I didnt read the part where you talked about the effects lol
            Functionally the same as charms in diablo, but yes they did clutter the inventory.
Exactly, so why make that problem even worse?
They're all there according to the wiki, it can be hard to notice some of them.
A percentage boost would change nothing about the hit rate or armor piercing. What's so bad about buffing the damage to stay at a similar dps? Does the identity matter when it's solely tied to dps.
Bruh, I'm fucking sad rn

    if i get invested enough i could eventually make it but someone will 100% beat me to it
Goodluck learning C++üíÄ
    It's C# actually.
        Tmodloader is in C++, terraria is C# iirc
            The tModLoader library is C#, and the large majority of the code in tModLoader is C#

    FFIV rydia, summoners first appeared in FFIII, but you're point still stands lmao
        Waaaay back when, FFIV used to be called FFII due to the other games not being released in english.
no, ark of the cosmos should be the final
    No, ark of the covenant. It gets a bonus if used with Indiana Jones‚Äô whip.
IIRC, this version was simply designed to come out as quickly as it could, so they took the ‚Äúminimum dev-time‚Äù approach to pretty much everything 1.4-related. We‚Äôll need to wait for a real update to see what their plans are for Zenith and other stuff
Wdym bruh its existence completely destroys the balance of all post moon lord mods including calamity
A lot of people ITT are really uppity about the concept of anything getting a nerf, even if it has the potential of completely busting the entire game through one class.
    At the end of the day if you grind enough things or find tricks in Terraria such as building perfect combat arenas and reforging for whatever you need in a fight, you can sort of cheese some bosses. That usually opens doors to progress much faster, and it's normally a part of the game. 

If you use goblin spikes to crush EoW then you get his drops and then it's easier to kill the other start-of-game bosses, for example. Building an arena with teleportation for Plantera underground... etc.

So instead of planned tricks you could use a weapon that is unusually strong early like Scourge of the Corruptor. Or even both the tricks and the weapons. 

But with the nerfs you *must* grind and perfect every arena because at the end of the day, it's more fun to fight when the boss' bullshit is matched or out-matched by the bullshit we build to deal with them. So the end result is... preparation takes more time - you need to grind more. And that's not always fun.
        I think everything you've said is fair. I even think Calamity is way overtuned on boss difficulty and either the endgame bosses need a nerf or endgame gear needs a buff. I just find a lot of people think nerfing is universally unacceptable, even if it would be both simpler and cleaner to just nerf some things.
            I agree, sometimes nerfing is the best way about it. 

In this case it's easy to argue against a modder nerfing something that is a part of the base-game though. (why didn't he balance around it like everyone else? why does it even need nerfing when it was accepted in the base game and by other mods? why not just accept that some things may perform better than others instead of nit-picking? and so on)
                I'd say that, except all of these things in Calamity were made BEFORE the new additions of vanilla 1.4.

So either...

1.  Calamity has to completely re-design it's endgame around the new numbers and potential of base game.

Or

2. Calamity nerfs the numbers/adjust the time of obtaining of a few of the new items.
then we turn that mob spawnrate *aaaaaaall* the way up!
Sadly Malice (or death) mode + eternity mode is impossible to complete. This is entirely due to Golem having conflicting mechanics that make him invincible to all damage in phase 2 when both are active. Every other boss is possible to beat with both modes activated. Skeletron Prime is another hard one, since you'll only be able to hit it for 1 damage every single attack, but still theoretically possible.
    Imagine fucking *GOLEM* ending your challenge playthrough that shit's just so funny to me
    This is actually possible because you can get the Eidolon Tablet which summons Lunatic Cultist. Eidolists that drop this item, spawn in 3rd layer of Abyss and start appearing after Wall of Flesh has been defeated.
Playing the game the way god intended
    God? I don't think so, but how that son of a bitch fabsol intended? Definitely 

(Still really salty about everything)
Is it that bad?
This is why I kind of prefer not using Calamity. The only real loss is the end-game bosses, all the way up to that the other mods are very nice... and Calamity breaks the early-game's balance and vanilla tricks.
If anything, Thorium should be the mod to balance around.
    I still don't understand how Calamity is more popular than Thorium. After playing both, I feel like Thorium is the better mod. It integrates with the base game much better.
        Most popular things rarely are objectively best.
            Popular things are the those which are advertised the most, like RLCraft from minecraft.
            Well I wouldn‚Äôt say ‚Äúobjectively best‚Äù, but yeah Thorium is better (even if it doesn‚Äôt the rogue class, but that‚Äôs easily surpassed by techniques).
        Calamity: MODDED terraria 

Thorium: modded TERRARIA
    Didn't Thorium used to be like... really bad? or am I thinking of a different one
        No no, you are thinking of tremor.

Thorium is the golden classic one.
            You're totally right, I am thinking of Tremor.
            Oh god, Tremor, I forgot that happened. Thorium is pretty fun though.
To be fair, they did nerf everything down in their last major update to have things balanced around vanilla (Murasama went from 20000 to 3000 for instance). Their endgame is still more OP than other mod endgames, but it means it's much safer to use Calamity weapons with other mods during certain points of progression.
Happy cake day!
I don't follow modding stuff so might be wrong but I believe they did a poll asking if people would prefer they delay it until more content is added or release early so people can play with it, and most people voted for early release so that's what they did.
for people who were still playing 1.3 calamity, this update DOES add new content: 1.4's content
Dude it‚Äôs free lol
    just cause its free doesn't mean its good or free from any ounce of criticism
        Thinking it‚Äôs good is irrelevant. Complaining about the lack of content (if it‚Äôs so good that you want more) is dumb when it‚Äôs free and in the works
Can you explain to me how to do that or link me something?
    np chief, to transfer your worlds from 1.3 to 1.4 you need to activate the 1.4 version, Doing that is very simple as you just need to right click the config button on the tmodloader at your library, Then click properties and betas, Then select none to go to 1.4, From there onward you need to click on "transfer worlds" on world creation, Then select your Map and Voila! your world should supposed to be transfered, but if dont, then just continue playing on 1.3 or wait to the devs to fix the 1.4 issue
        Got it thanks a bunch üôè
            no problem chief, always happy to help somebody
It kinda fucking deletes the exo mechs and Scal so idk.
    It doesn't delete them, far from it. The dps was similar to a DoG weapon. The main advantage was its animation. It passes through blocks and requires no aiming. So, basically it has 100% uptime.
For people that haven't played Calamity, pretty much every class in the game gets a set of accessories that scale in power as the player progresses w/ new tiers that can be crafted as new materials become available. It's sorta like the power glove line for melee except every class gets something similar. 

Also I'm doubting it, but would the Zenith count as true melee? Because sweet baby jesus that'd be sick w/ all the accessories that buff true melee.
    I think it would and is then the reason it gets pushed to post Yharon
    I mean technically speaking it's true melee, you just happen to be chucking the sword at the enemy faster and from further away. You are still *technically* hitting them with the main part of the sword(s). From a gameplay standpoint? No way in hell it would be true melee.
Fabsol uses she/her pronouns.
I too like the star waifus
Playing Calamity can be really stressful, and having a cute star lady occasionally show up to tell me that I'm doing great really helps alleviate that.
yes but AA just did that but worse, with the superboss basically forcing you to use AA weapons only
    I never said that aa wasnt bad
Ye, its kinda people being mad at people who like charizard from pokemon despite it being overrated, like The Big mac has a place in the table for a reason, plus its not like Calamity being installed makes you unable to play other mods
Probably, don't work on calamity or Terraria mods, but I am a game developer myself. I can't imagine working for free, for a bunch of freeloaders to whine and whinge about every decision I make. I'd tell them to go fuck themselves, too.
    yep, this is pretty much exactly how i feel on the matter. i sympathize with the devs and i hope this recent wave of needless toxicity isn't affecting them too heavily.

this is a great mod, no i don't necessarily agree with the way it does some things, but there are always better ways to discuss these things. raging and bashing won't convince the devs, if anything it'll probably do the opposite. that's how passion projects work
He kinda made a bunch of alts to defend himself with on that sub specifically soo... he kinda did have something to do on there. He also constantly told people they should play a certain kind of way (without nurse exploit, without the alchemy mod etc.) and called people trash if they didn't play the mod as he intended.

edit: r/calamitymod_ even has a rule saying that telling others to "get good" is a bannable offense so yea. I think that might be referring to his actions.

edit: apparently the get good rule wasn't inspired by our favorite toxic dev, and the alts were of some other salty kid. Sry for that, other stuff is accurate thou
    as a mod of the new subreddit, fabsol had nothing to do with the original subreddit, the alts were made by some toxic kid and we were sent proof of it. the get good rule is unrelated
        Dang. Oh well, thx for clarification and sorry for misinformation.
            U should add another edit on your original comment saying it‚Äôs untrue if you‚Äôre really sorry :v
                People don't really care about what the truth is, they just like to have excuses to blame people they don't like :)
                    Jeez bro I edited already sheesh
                    no fucking way your getting downvoted for this reply

that's a nice argument, Senator, why don't you back it up with a source?
        It happened, trust me.

[...like, unironically.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CalamityMod/comments/v59ub6/fabsol_trying_to_not_be_a_jerk_challenge/) Here's the [image](https://i.redd.it/olxg1vuyur391.jpg) the post came with.
            Although there is proof of him being a jackass there is none of him using alts.
                Multiple accounts a few days old defending him? (as in the ONLY accounts defending him?) If this isn't enough proof for you, you're experiencing mental disociation.
                    Weird you wanna say im disassociating because there is no proof. You are almost as toxic as he is in those screenshots. If you think alts repeating what he said verbatim is proof or evidence I would recommend that you not be any profession like a police officer or lawyer. Would not make a great fit. If you have any way to link it back to him and not trolls or people just trying to stir the pot or add fuel to the fire be my guest and I will eat my words.

all i wanted to do was correct misinformation damn didnt even say i liked fabsol really

its disappointing to see a subreddit for one of my favorite games act like this

why you playing calamity with thorium tho, Like these two are like mentos and cocacola, never be put together
    I had read somewhere that the special ocean of biome of thorium was chosen on the opposite side of the abyss specifically to let it be used with calamity. I also saw a video where someone was playing both together. I don't know much about thorium, but it didn't grab me like calamity did.
        yeah but like thorium is severely underpowered compared to calamity, if you want a mod that goes well with calamity play the stars above
you don‚Äôt enjoy dozens of bullet bell boss fights with .1%  chance of dropping the item you want that becomes completely useless once you beat the next boss?
    wait till calamity loot swap comes in, or Better yet just get alchemist npc Operator and a shitton of platinum and buy the bags
        Calamity devs on their way to make the mod uncompatible with Alchemist NPC and many other QoL mods
            Bam, re compatibility patch specifically that requires calamity and alchemist  or whatever mod so MAKE it compatible again.
            dont give them ideias
    The 1% drops get stronger the further you get into the game so the weapons don‚Äôt fall off too fast.
        That's *ooooooold* Calamity, man. Legendary drops haven't scaled in *YEARS*.
            Wait so halibut cannon used to get better, does it not now?
                Halibut still does. All the other old legendaries like Aegis Blade, Blossom Flux, etc. don't anymore (and in my opinion, they're in the least creative and most unrewarding state they've ever been in).
They pander to try hards and masochists, have you seen the levels in difficulty they added
    brother if you think a higher level of difficulty thats basically a way superior master mode without being simply damage buffs to enemies means its for masochist then look at master mode for the worthy hardcore no wasd copper shortsword only
Calamity devs had a very different idea of fun a few years ago. Maybe Dokuro stepping down messed with Drew in some way, but the mod took a huge turn for the lame in the past few updates.
[removed]
    [removed]
yeah thats why there are countless QOL changes that make the game more fun then i spose
Not every mod is tailored to your play style. Making dumbass statements like that reflects poorly on yourself, I'd recommend avoiding that in the future.
    Chill brother, I like playing Calamity but it's undeniable that the devs make some questionable decisions regarding fun. Don't know why you got all offended about it though. You don't need to be so protective of a terraria mod lmao.
        Not every mod is tailored to your play style. Making dumbass statements like that reflects poorly on yourself, I'd recommend avoiding that in the future.
Don‚Äôt play it then
    Is this a Fabsol alt?
    not happ'n'n
Ah that would make sense. I think you could just have the accessory have that max time you're talking about, since the rocket boots add to the flight time of wings, so it makes sense for other accessories to increase the flight time as eell
he does that anyways
Good explanation. However, instead of explaining all this you can just tell to anyone curious to play GT NH (GregTech: New Horizons) and it will be self-explanatory
    Thank you! This Calamity drama just kinda dug out a memory from like 9 years ago. I haven't played as much FtB or FtB styled modpacks in recent years and don't really know what Gregtech New Horizons is, but given who he is my guess is that it is months worth of grind with increasingly complex systems that end in you becoming some kind of industrial god.
        Cool to see someone who was around back then in the wild! I still remember playing RedPower and looking at the movable frames - it was like Create, years before Create
            Yea man it was some good times. My friend group had a whole server running with the Ultimate pack and we had some fun coming up with factories that combined multiple mods into an amalgam of industry.
                I loved that. Have you played modded Minecraft recently? Create: Above and Beyond was a great modpack (although endgame was kind of too math-ey for me)
I haven't heard about calamities developers much but the sentiment here reminds me of Starbounds Frackin Universe dev and similar criticisms going towards him. He literally made an update to his mod that detected another mod that reverted a nerf he made to a certain planet type(making them useless to visit). In the code he made a line called ''Idiot Check'' which checks if people are using the mod, and essentially causes every weather effect to happen at the same time and kill the player.  He's had a history of doing other things in that ballpark but holy moly that was ridiculous.
THIS this right here. It's the attempts at re-writing the lore that get me the worst, the art looks like it belongs in Starbound instead of Terraria, and everything that the devs have written reads like something a 13 year old AOL roleplayer from the 90s wrote.
    At this point calamity feels like a diffrent game so I dont see a point complaining about it having a diffrent art style or weird lore.
    You mean, re-writting terraria's official, OPTIONAL, lore that's very basic and mediocre at best? Yeah, the lore is bad, but it's getting fixed to be better written, so this could all change. Terraria also got more and more detailed art style, see EoL. The art style is a matter of TASTES my dude. There are texture packs for a reason, and mods shouldn't be forced to cater to one artstyle as many mods don't. If the art style is to detailed and too complex for your liking, there are texture packs out there that could possibly change it all to look like earlier vanilla like sprites, or versely, if you just want consistency there is a mod that makes all the art of vanilla more detailed like cal.
eh the only real bullet hell boss is SCal, and the effects are meh, the Radiance mod on the other hand, now ***that's*** a bullet hell with amazing effects, it turns EoL into a fucking brutal fight
    Tbh radiance feels much more fair, the bullethell is harder and you get oneshot, but you'll probably never feel like you were killed by a projectile you couldn't see, yellow on black makes it very clear what's going on, unlike scal (or yharon) where all projectiles are red, the enemy is red and there also is a heavy red filter makin everything else on screen red, so every moving thing on screen blends into a deep red mush.
        yeah for sure, SCal is a pain in the ass cuz you can't see the projectiles
I will say the art think is subjective, and many mods do a similar thing too in their own way, plus there is a mod to retexture it to fit more with the art direction of cal, so. And touhou-like bosses aren't a bad thing. It's when they poorly designed bullet hails is when problems arise. The visual overload sounds like a device problem than the mod problem though. The vanilla style of boss is a matter of taste, so you have every right to not want to play it for you reasons. But I want to make sure the subjective is not phrased in a way that makes it come off objective. And to make things that ALL mods are guilty come to light. I hate this argument used against Cal when other bigger mods are also guilty of this, not just cal. Plus, who cares if the art style is different? Minecraft mods have done the same. and like Minecraft, terraria has texture pack options, so this isn't a real factor for not playing the mod imo. The way they handle their boss fights and how it effects other mods? Yeah, a more valid reason imo given that unlike artstyles that can be changed with texture packs, this is more skin deep than the latter. 

Also, as a laptop player myself, playing any mods with friends, I having a lot lags the game. Which is why I eventually plan to go PC to handle it.
    i hate when people blame calamity for not being balanced with other mods when other mods are doing that and dont get blamed, like ancients awakened( which is a worse calamity made by a even more terrible person) has it final boss take 1 damage if youre using weapons that arent AA or vanilla, so for example if youre playing with stars above and u use bury the light on the boss it only deals 1 damage
        That sucks, yet it seems we are in the minority as evident by my down vote and massive mindless up votes for the comment above. Yeah, most other mods don't even balance that well around vanilla either. A good portion do, but not all. And when you get serious like me and try to call this out or just talk respectful in general, you are: hated, down voted, memed on, rumor spread about you, trashed talked about you behind your back, so much more and become INFAMOUS among the internet like me.

I hate the online and irl to a extent. The world kind of sucks imo.
The way to fight bosses is as close to no-hit as possible. Bosses tend towards screen filling bullet hells. Everything does absurd amounts of damage. You can get hit a few times, but defense is heavily nerfed, and flying/movement is actively nerfed in many fights. You're heavily rewarded for not getting hit at all in general.

Which you know, is fine! Some people like the pattern-learning style. But I don't like how they force it on people by crowbarring out every mechanic that threatens it or suddenly becomes unbalanced because it's good in their hyper specific world.
    Thank you I will give it a pass..... I am not the bewt at dodging so what you describe sounds like plain frustration to me.
        Nothing wrong with that. There are lots of excellent mods out there. It's worth giving it a try, since there is always adjustable difficulty. But I really don't like the design philosophy and have things I enjoy much more.
Busted OP? I mean, you're allowed to have your opinion! I think that spending a whole accessory slot on movement should give you better movement. And more importantly, is this an uproar? I just gave my opinion.
    nah, the uproar wasnt yours i just meant people here in general. but it DOUBLES vertical acceleration. I think they did nerf it too much to the point where youre right and its barely worth using which is a bit of a shame though
I'm sure I can! I never said it was mandatory for playing or anything. Just that it's fun and the devs hate fun. It's a running theme for Calamity design decisions in my opinion.
 I feel like a lot of cal's content can be really bland or bullshitty at times, but you can't deny that the art team has is on point
    A lot of the art is super good, but doesn‚Äôt fit in terraria at all
        I mean, Terraria‚Äôs art doesn‚Äôt fit Terraria. The game has such an inconsistent art style - compare the Empress of Light to the Eye of Cthulhu
            I see it as the game‚Äôs style evolving, even the endgame tools have some level of consistency with the early sprites. On the other hand Calamity feels like art assets for a totally different game, it‚Äôs UI doesn‚Äôt match at all and the tools feel like generic fantasy garbage with weird shapes that make no sense mixed between weapons that would likely kill it‚Äôs own user realistically
                Ah true enough. The arts great but if we‚Äôre talking practicality it‚Äôs also very bizarre yeah
No, I didn't even know about anything involving this prior to this thread. When I played/kept up with calamity it was well over a year ago. So stuff prior to that, even lol.
Plus, they took up tons of inventory space.
Well yeah and then probably the reason why shyguymask was able to complete post-ml calamity without movement keys (wasd, other stuff was allowed) was because of the slime god lore item which now does nothing
They had effects but the devs removed the effects
    I know? I‚Äôm saying that those items were a weird concept in the first place.
        Oops I didnt read the part where you talked about the effects lol
        Functionally the same as charms in diablo, but yes they did clutter the inventory.
This dude has unwittingly declared himself the messiah

This is actually possible because you can get the Eidolon Tablet which summons Lunatic Cultist. Eidolists that drop this item, spawn in 3rd layer of Abyss and start appearing after Wall of Flesh has been defeated.
God? I don't think so, but how that son of a bitch fabsol intended? Definitely 

(Still really salty about everything)
I still don't understand how Calamity is more popular than Thorium. After playing both, I feel like Thorium is the better mod. It integrates with the base game much better.
    Most popular things rarely are objectively best.
        Popular things are the those which are advertised the most, like RLCraft from minecraft.
        Well I wouldn‚Äôt say ‚Äúobjectively best‚Äù, but yeah Thorium is better (even if it doesn‚Äôt the rogue class, but that‚Äôs easily surpassed by techniques).
    Calamity: MODDED terraria 

Thorium: modded TERRARIA
Didn't Thorium used to be like... really bad? or am I thinking of a different one
    No no, you are thinking of tremor.

Thorium is the golden classic one.
        You're totally right, I am thinking of Tremor.
        Oh god, Tremor, I forgot that happened. Thorium is pretty fun though.
just cause its free doesn't mean its good or free from any ounce of criticism
    Thinking it‚Äôs good is irrelevant. Complaining about the lack of content (if it‚Äôs so good that you want more) is dumb when it‚Äôs free and in the works
np chief, to transfer your worlds from 1.3 to 1.4 you need to activate the 1.4 version, Doing that is very simple as you just need to right click the config button on the tmodloader at your library, Then click properties and betas, Then select none to go to 1.4, From there onward you need to click on "transfer worlds" on world creation, Then select your Map and Voila! your world should supposed to be transfered, but if dont, then just continue playing on 1.3 or wait to the devs to fix the 1.4 issue
    Got it thanks a bunch üôè
        no problem chief, always happy to help somebody
It doesn't delete them, far from it. The dps was similar to a DoG weapon. The main advantage was its animation. It passes through blocks and requires no aiming. So, basically it has 100% uptime.
I think it would and is then the reason it gets pushed to post Yharon
I mean technically speaking it's true melee, you just happen to be chucking the sword at the enemy faster and from further away. You are still *technically* hitting them with the main part of the sword(s). From a gameplay standpoint? No way in hell it would be true melee.
I never said that aa wasnt bad
yep, this is pretty much exactly how i feel on the matter. i sympathize with the devs and i hope this recent wave of needless toxicity isn't affecting them too heavily.

this is a great mod, no i don't necessarily agree with the way it does some things, but there are always better ways to discuss these things. raging and bashing won't convince the devs, if anything it'll probably do the opposite. that's how passion projects work
as a mod of the new subreddit, fabsol had nothing to do with the original subreddit, the alts were made by some toxic kid and we were sent proof of it. the get good rule is unrelated
    Dang. Oh well, thx for clarification and sorry for misinformation.
        U should add another edit on your original comment saying it‚Äôs untrue if you‚Äôre really sorry :v
            People don't really care about what the truth is, they just like to have excuses to blame people they don't like :)
                Jeez bro I edited already sheesh
                no fucking way your getting downvoted for this reply

>He kinda made a bunch of alts to defend himself with on that sub specifically soo... he kinda did have something to do on there. He also constantly told people they should play a certain kind of way (without nurse exploit, without the alchemy mod etc.) and called people trash if they didn't play the mod as he intended.

that's a nice argument, Senator, why don't you back it up with a source?
    It happened, trust me.

[...like, unironically.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CalamityMod/comments/v59ub6/fabsol_trying_to_not_be_a_jerk_challenge/) Here's the [image](https://i.redd.it/olxg1vuyur391.jpg) the post came with.
        Although there is proof of him being a jackass there is none of him using alts.
            Multiple accounts a few days old defending him? (as in the ONLY accounts defending him?) If this isn't enough proof for you, you're experiencing mental disociation.
                Weird you wanna say im disassociating because there is no proof. You are almost as toxic as he is in those screenshots. If you think alts repeating what he said verbatim is proof or evidence I would recommend that you not be any profession like a police officer or lawyer. Would not make a great fit. If you have any way to link it back to him and not trolls or people just trying to stir the pot or add fuel to the fire be my guest and I will eat my words.

I had read somewhere that the special ocean of biome of thorium was chosen on the opposite side of the abyss specifically to let it be used with calamity. I also saw a video where someone was playing both together. I don't know much about thorium, but it didn't grab me like calamity did.
    yeah but like thorium is severely underpowered compared to calamity, if you want a mod that goes well with calamity play the stars above
wait till calamity loot swap comes in, or Better yet just get alchemist npc Operator and a shitton of platinum and buy the bags
    Calamity devs on their way to make the mod uncompatible with Alchemist NPC and many other QoL mods
        Bam, re compatibility patch specifically that requires calamity and alchemist  or whatever mod so MAKE it compatible again.
        dont give them ideias
The 1% drops get stronger the further you get into the game so the weapons don‚Äôt fall off too fast.
    That's *ooooooold* Calamity, man. Legendary drops haven't scaled in *YEARS*.
        Wait so halibut cannon used to get better, does it not now?
            Halibut still does. All the other old legendaries like Aegis Blade, Blossom Flux, etc. don't anymore (and in my opinion, they're in the least creative and most unrewarding state they've ever been in).
brother if you think a higher level of difficulty thats basically a way superior master mode without being simply damage buffs to enemies means its for masochist then look at master mode for the worthy hardcore no wasd copper shortsword only
[removed]
Chill brother, I like playing Calamity but it's undeniable that the devs make some questionable decisions regarding fun. Don't know why you got all offended about it though. You don't need to be so protective of a terraria mod lmao.
    Not every mod is tailored to your play style. Making dumbass statements like that reflects poorly on yourself, I'd recommend avoiding that in the future.
Is this a Fabsol alt?
not happ'n'n
Thank you! This Calamity drama just kinda dug out a memory from like 9 years ago. I haven't played as much FtB or FtB styled modpacks in recent years and don't really know what Gregtech New Horizons is, but given who he is my guess is that it is months worth of grind with increasingly complex systems that end in you becoming some kind of industrial god.
    Cool to see someone who was around back then in the wild! I still remember playing RedPower and looking at the movable frames - it was like Create, years before Create
        Yea man it was some good times. My friend group had a whole server running with the Ultimate pack and we had some fun coming up with factories that combined multiple mods into an amalgam of industry.
            I loved that. Have you played modded Minecraft recently? Create: Above and Beyond was a great modpack (although endgame was kind of too math-ey for me)
At this point calamity feels like a diffrent game so I dont see a point complaining about it having a diffrent art style or weird lore.
You mean, re-writting terraria's official, OPTIONAL, lore that's very basic and mediocre at best? Yeah, the lore is bad, but it's getting fixed to be better written, so this could all change. Terraria also got more and more detailed art style, see EoL. The art style is a matter of TASTES my dude. There are texture packs for a reason, and mods shouldn't be forced to cater to one artstyle as many mods don't. If the art style is to detailed and too complex for your liking, there are texture packs out there that could possibly change it all to look like earlier vanilla like sprites, or versely, if you just want consistency there is a mod that makes all the art of vanilla more detailed like cal.
Tbh radiance feels much more fair, the bullethell is harder and you get oneshot, but you'll probably never feel like you were killed by a projectile you couldn't see, yellow on black makes it very clear what's going on, unlike scal (or yharon) where all projectiles are red, the enemy is red and there also is a heavy red filter makin everything else on screen red, so every moving thing on screen blends into a deep red mush.
    yeah for sure, SCal is a pain in the ass cuz you can't see the projectiles
i hate when people blame calamity for not being balanced with other mods when other mods are doing that and dont get blamed, like ancients awakened( which is a worse calamity made by a even more terrible person) has it final boss take 1 damage if youre using weapons that arent AA or vanilla, so for example if youre playing with stars above and u use bury the light on the boss it only deals 1 damage
    That sucks, yet it seems we are in the minority as evident by my down vote and massive mindless up votes for the comment above. Yeah, most other mods don't even balance that well around vanilla either. A good portion do, but not all. And when you get serious like me and try to call this out or just talk respectful in general, you are: hated, down voted, memed on, rumor spread about you, trashed talked about you behind your back, so much more and become INFAMOUS among the internet like me.

I hate the online and irl to a extent. The world kind of sucks imo.
Thank you I will give it a pass..... I am not the bewt at dodging so what you describe sounds like plain frustration to me.
    Nothing wrong with that. There are lots of excellent mods out there. It's worth giving it a try, since there is always adjustable difficulty. But I really don't like the design philosophy and have things I enjoy much more.
nah, the uproar wasnt yours i just meant people here in general. but it DOUBLES vertical acceleration. I think they did nerf it too much to the point where youre right and its barely worth using which is a bit of a shame though
A lot of the art is super good, but doesn‚Äôt fit in terraria at all
    I mean, Terraria‚Äôs art doesn‚Äôt fit Terraria. The game has such an inconsistent art style - compare the Empress of Light to the Eye of Cthulhu
        I see it as the game‚Äôs style evolving, even the endgame tools have some level of consistency with the early sprites. On the other hand Calamity feels like art assets for a totally different game, it‚Äôs UI doesn‚Äôt match at all and the tools feel like generic fantasy garbage with weird shapes that make no sense mixed between weapons that would likely kill it‚Äôs own user realistically
            Ah true enough. The arts great but if we‚Äôre talking practicality it‚Äôs also very bizarre yeah
I know? I‚Äôm saying that those items were a weird concept in the first place.
    Oops I didnt read the part where you talked about the effects lol
    Functionally the same as charms in diablo, but yes they did clutter the inventory.
Tmodloader is in C++, terraria is C# iirc
    The tModLoader library is C#, and the large majority of the code in tModLoader is C#
Waaaay back when, FFIV used to be called FFII due to the other games not being released in english.
I think everything you've said is fair. I even think Calamity is way overtuned on boss difficulty and either the endgame bosses need a nerf or endgame gear needs a buff. I just find a lot of people think nerfing is universally unacceptable, even if it would be both simpler and cleaner to just nerf some things.
    I agree, sometimes nerfing is the best way about it. 

In this case it's easy to argue against a modder nerfing something that is a part of the base-game though. (why didn't he balance around it like everyone else? why does it even need nerfing when it was accepted in the base game and by other mods? why not just accept that some things may perform better than others instead of nit-picking? and so on)
        I'd say that, except all of these things in Calamity were made BEFORE the new additions of vanilla 1.4.

So either...

1.  Calamity has to completely re-design it's endgame around the new numbers and potential of base game.

Or

2. Calamity nerfs the numbers/adjust the time of obtaining of a few of the new items.
