[[After 112 hours finally i completed 112%]]





Now you can never touch that save file again. At least not for more than 3 minutes haha.
    Why not?
        Mostly joking.

If they play for more than 3 minutes, the time will hit 113 hours. There's just something nice about 112% and 112 Hours.
            I have a 112% save with 67 hours, it's my first one too. Two hours until i quit hollow knight
                lol nice
                There’s no way, show proof, that’s insane lol
                    That’s not too bad I had a very similar first time and so did many others on this sub
                    Ive had 112% in 47 hrs with proof!
                        I've had 112% in -6 hours but my dog ate my computer so sadly i can't show you...
                            Oh dont worry, i have proof, check i posted it last week
                                I wasn't doubting your acheivment, i was just trying to make a joke. I'd still like to see the screenshot tho
                                    It is in my profile posted one week ago on this sub
                Ooo, look at you, Mr. Fancy. If we are flexing I have a 112% at 47 hours!! Check the post history 😤
                    i have a save file at 1 hour, hahahaha
                        Lmaoo nice
                            I have a steel soul file at (     ) hours.
Did you finish that 112% in the Colosseum of Fools?

Was the Trial of the Fool harder than all of Godhome?
    Yes
        Understandable
            SAME
                If you guys find trail of fools harder i might have an easier time at the pantheon.
                    Personally I found trial of the fool a lot easier than the pantheons. At least easier than pantheon 3 which is the one im currently on. I guess it all depends on whether or not you're better at fighting bosses or fighting lots of enemies.
                        The enemies are more random I feel like
                            They spawn in a set order so I just had to remember which ones came when and then it was ok
                                Those bugs above that shoot goop while spikes are below is hardest part imo
                                    Primal aspids are the worst
                                    The spike floor part is definitely the toughest bit. I don't know if you already do, but I've used hiveblood for that so I can still heal
                                    that was hardest part for me as well, you have to learn to practice the downswipe jump bounce for that part.
                        Beat trial of the fool on my first serious attempt but gave up on pantheon 3 after a week and haven’t been back
                        I second this the fool I did in a couple of tries but knowing the trial of the knight starts to have double mask guys I’m not even gonna touch that I beat sage and that’s as far as I’m willing to go I already don’t like boss rush things and theres no chance I’m gonna do a boss rush but some things do double dmg fuck that

                        If you mean the ToF i just use nail arts and vengeful spirit. I use the charms for them too. Also dont forget you can pogo on enemies.
                            Also pogo resets your monarch wings
                                That too.

                                With the build i go with and having gone through many tries and finally learning the order and move set of the enemies yeah it becomes easier. I mean before i watched the youtube video with the nail only run i was stuck for so long. 

It been a long while since ive played so ill prob screw up.
                    Pantheon 5 is the hardest IMO, I still haven't beaten it and it's a very long boss rush, but only the first 4 pantheons are required for 112%. ToF 3 is not nearly as bad, and I managed to do it before I fully upgraded my nail.
                        Is that the one with the Pale Champion? I generally dont find it it that bad but then again thats me saying it after i found out how to handle the enemies.
                    It's different for everyone. I had 3 nail upgrades and beat each level of the Trial without dying once. Then I died twice to Elder Hu :P
                        Kudos to you for doing them all first try. Man im so envious of you. I cant quite say i remember how many tries i did on bosses so lets just say it took a couple. 🎂
            oh man nah the 4th pantheon is harder than all of the colosseum trials put together
                I actually found the fourth pantheon pretty easy it only took me 3 attempts to beat it but I understand fully why you would find it difficult
                    3 attempts??? BRUH
    It took me a while to beat the trial of fools but I can't get past pantheon of the sage. Zote always fucks me up and if I get past him, uumuu finishes me off. I ended up just giving up and completing the game without finishing the pantheons
        Uumuu should be a chance to heal yourself fully and get max soul (you can dream nail Uumuu even if it's not vulnerable), just be patient and don't hit the jellyfish into Uumuu unless you have a perfect shot.
    no fookin way, 5th trial of Godhome has  every boss in it including the asshole hard ones.
        You don't need to do p5 for 112
            Really? What about p4? I’m at 109% and the only things I haven’t done are NKG and pantheons 3-5 so I’m wondering what will give the percentages I need.
                Yeah you need p4 just not p5. The wiki shows everything needed for 112.
                I think you're also missing the completion of the hunters journal.
                    Hunter's Journal is not a percent.
                        What? It should be
                            That's not the discussion...
                        Ah you're right.
                    I assumed that the last few bosses in P5 are what my hunters journal is missing, do you not need them for the journal?
                        Nope. Oro and Mato, Sheo, Sly, Pure Vessel, etc. all increase both the numerator and denominator of the hunter's journal, so they're not required for completion and don't actually "help" you complete more. All the Grimm content, all Zote variants, and White Defender aren't needed either.
                            interesting....I wonder what the heck I'm missing then because my hunter journal has info for all the monsters on there
                P4 counts. Are you on PC? There's a save game analyzer tool that I started using once I knocked out the first ending. Click on the "Spoilers" checkbox to show locations, and everything links out to wiki pages.

https://reznormichael.github.io/hollow-knight-completion-check/
                That's your 3% right there. Once you beat NKG you will get 1%, and pantheon 3 and 4 will give you the other 2%. You're almost there :)
    Not all of godhome just pantheons 1 through 4
    I find trial of the fool pretty easy although I did beat NKG before I attempted it lol.
    Tbh trial of fool was easier than godhome
Nice. I beat p5 after 111 hours and 56 mins. I literally set a stop watch for 4 more minutes and loaded that save to get 112hour and 0 minutes. Super pointless but now I can’t ever load that save again
    Can you copy the save file to a separate column and play that one?
        It’s been a while since I played the game so I don’t remember if that’s an option or not. But honestly I’ve already played the hell out of Hollow Knight. Played it 5 or 6 times to get all achievements. got 100% twice and 112% twice. On the Nintendo switch, all my save slots are full. Don’t think I’ll be deleting one to play again unless Silksong takes like a year to drop and I get an itch to explore Hallownest again.
Took me like 170h😔
    Ugh I’m at like 150 and still haven’t finished the last god home
        You dont need the fifth pantheon for 112%
What I wanna know is how the HECK you got to godhome in 1 hour 10mins
    theres a certain gamemode where you start with everything unlocked, you start in godhome, and you cant leave
        omg how did I not know about this!! So it’s basically just a boss rush mini version of the game?
            Yup, it's pretty nifty. https://hollowknight.fandom.com/wiki/Godseeker_Mode
    I put the godmaster spawn I dont remeber the exact name
    When you start a new file, you can choose between a normal game, steel soul game, or Godseeker mode. Godseeker mode requires the first three pantheons to have been beaten on another file and allows the player to start right in Godhome with all charms and spells/abilities unlocked.
Ah, the trial of the fool. That little bitch of a challenge is all that’s standing between me and 112 lmao
    You beat the pantheon but not the trail of fools?
        The pantheon was pretty easy for me (except zote), and you don’t need the 4th or 5th for 112. I beat 4th anyways but TotF is still hard for me for some reason I can’t get past the floorless section
            You do need to finish Pantheon 4 for a completion percentage. You're right about Pantheon 5 not being necessary, though.
            Use nail arts and vengeful spirit. The charms for those two help a lot as well. Sometimes you may need to pogo on enemies as well.

About 112% do all the mask shards soul vessals count?
                Yeah you need all masks and soul vessels meaning that stupid flower quest was needed lmao
                    Pain peko.
            I got past the floorless part by just pogoing enemies as much as possible, and I had the sharp shadow charm so every time I shade dashed through enemies it dealt damage. I've seen people suggest hiveblood but that only works if you're good enough at dodging to get a mask back between hits
    I beat it but can't beat the dlc boss
        Grimm or big grimm? If its them, their fights are like a dance - they do one attack which has one or two openings for your to hit them, then do another very shortly after. Get comfortable dodging before even trying to also get hits in. Ince you're able to dodge each attack individually, you can dodge the whole fight. Select a few of their attacks that you're most comfortable with and choose those to be the ones you get damage in on. For me that was the fire bat one and the upward fire spout one.

Or if you mean just normal grimm, you could equip every spell charm and unbreakable heart and then tank him while abyss shrieking him from beneath until you win.
            I've tried idk. It's the final phase of Grimm. Hes so fast and takes two health every hit. Tough asf
                If you only want the completion percentage, and not to beat the boss, you could always go back to the howling cliffs and banish the grimm troupe. If gives the percent that beating nkg would.
                    How does this work?
                        When collecting the final flames for the ritual, you find brumm in deepnest. He tells you that he doesn't want to be part of the endless cycle of the grimm troupe, and that you can banish them and break the cycle if you go back to where you summoned them the first time. When you're there, I think you just wack the lantern a  bunch and then the grimm troupe will be gone. Brumm will show up in dirtmouth as Nymm, and you'll replace your grimmchild charm with carefree melody. 
Instead of the Ritual achievement, you get Banishment.
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be
you did it in 112 houres like 112 percent complition
Each 1 percent cost an hour i see
lmao same,i got it about 110 hours in and colosseum of fools was my last percent as well. wasnt able to beat it until i came back to the game a year later and did it on my second try. now im going for true 100% (stuff like all bindings and PoP).
One good deed an hour
Congratulations!!!!
I'm at 110% and 60 hours in, i can totally see me needing another 50+ for the last two pantheons...
    Pantheon 5 isn't required for 112% tho
        Last 3 then, I have 3, 4 and the final one to go. Nailmaster sly is being a pain
Amazing, took me way longer
Having 112% at 112hrs should be its own achievement. Damn impressive my guy
Ok now do it in steel soul mode
    Hahaha. NO
I have to say it: You actually played closer to 113 than 112
Did it really took u that long?
The fact that you were still at the Colosseum of fools means that you still trying to beat the third trial ( i think ) well anyways good job on the 112%
    I beat it
        Oh that's cool.. How much time did it take you?
            Its on the pic
                I was talking about how much time did it take you for the Colosseum of fools alone? Unless you devoted 112 hours of your time to the Colosseum?
                    No when i took the photo i had already beat it
                        He is asking how long it took you to beat the trial of fools specifically not the entirety of the game.
                            Oh a few tries probs half an hour
                        Oh okay.
I genuinely cannot understand how someone could get any enjoyment out of doing this. I had to put this game down after about 40 hours because there was nothing else to do. One of my favorite games, but after a week or two, it was time to move on. 

But to spend 112 HOURS? Like, dude, there are other videogames out there. How is a number next to your save file worth going through the same content that many times in a row? The game doesn’t even have 112 hours of content to go through. How do you not get bored? There is so much other new content in other games you could have experienced in all that time, yet you chose to play the same videogame of who’s content you’ve already played to death again and again and again and again. And somehow seeing that one little number makes all that time doing the same thing over and over again worth it? I just will never be able to understand what could possibly be that appealing to compel someone to go through that much effort.
    The reason i spent this much time is because I was struggling a LOT to beat it and I also spent several hours lost
        I would have 100% given up and looked up a walkthrough at that point. I also never beat Godhome because it was way more effort than it was worth. Wasn’t enjoyable after a certain point and there’s better ways to spend free time.
            I did several times but yhe game is too much fun
                Welp, different strokes I guess
    This game has easily 100+ hours content to offer + you can do achievements, beat it in other game mode, master bosses on radiant diff, also there are a lot of mods, and all that for such a low price if you have played only 40 hours you didnt saw half of the content.. maybe on yt. I dont understand honestly whats wrong with playing the game you like.. some people just want to master one game if they like it, maybe you havent found that one good game yourself that you are ready to spent so much hours in.
    Maybe the problem is that there aren't other videogames that are interesting that I have discovered yet and that's the reason some people pump crazy numbers into the games that are interesting.
        If Hollow Knight is the only game you find interesting, then you have a much bigger problem. There are SO many amazing games out there, I really don’t think that’s a good enough reason.
            There are alot of amazing games out there but personally games like hollowknight and dark souls are so unique that you only satisfy their itch by playing that game. Everyone has different vices and preferences and I would argue its out of the norm to not play games this way.
    Crazy how different people can enjoy different things in a game, right?

Completion is its own reward. To know you've overcome something through great trial and tribulation is quite exhilarating. It's no different than people who try to beat world record speed runs, or try to ladder to the top of competitive games like Hearthstone or Overwatch.

Some people game for achievement, completion, and mastery. Try on some empathy and seeing it from their perspective. To you, attempting something for the 50th time might feel stale, and like a bad excuse for content. To me, someone who plays for mastery, that 50th attempt is as much a part of the game content as the first attempt was.

Hollow Knight is a masocore game. It attracts a certain type of player, eg. people with a much higher tolerance for repetition, and a lower tolerance for quitting are going to have their hands all over a game like this.
112%is only map location.
    What do you mean?
        It's not progress, it's for the places you've been on the map.  You can get 112% and not finish the game.
            if you have 112% that means they done everything at least once except Radiance,
PoH, PoP, ~~White Flower~~ and Hunters Jounal, which they may or may not have done. But the 112% tracks far more than just “have you been everywhere”
                I think you have to do white flower since mask shards count for completion
                    Oh i forgot it gave a shard, will edit.
                Yep it tracks charms collected, certain bosses defeated as well as the DLCs
            It is progress. You can search for what each act does for percentage of completion. You can register 112% complete in inventory without actually finishing the game (as in not defeating final boss(es)), but to get the achievements/quests, you have to finish the game.
            If i open my map it says 112% complete
                Sorry inventory
            No you need to beat the game to get 112%.
                I did
            Thats literally not true in the slightest. Where did you even pull this out of?
            It is progress! No doubt about it.
            You are just tacitly wrong.
                Who is wrong pls help Im confused
gg
I’ve almost done everything in this game and it’s totaled around 300 hours all I have left is the pantheons with all bindings. I’m not gonna lie to you radiant absolute radiance took me seventy hours.
\*ahem\* 113 hours \*ahem\*
    No no ignore that
That’s about how long it took me! 112 hour friend!
    112 hour boys stick together
I got to 111% sub 80 hours l, I'm just stuck on the final two pantheons.
    The pantheon of hallownest is not required for 112%
        Imma do it anyway
That’s too close to 113 hours
    Thats when I finished it
That’s awesome!
You have definitely earned the title of “fool” for conquering the entire coliseum.
Good job, just wondering what was the last percent you completed.
    The trial of the fool
        Mmmm noice
I've got a 96% Completion save at around 20h or so. Just trying to find all the grubs so i can complete the charms and pure nail. Then onto the Pantheons.
Beautiful!
Do you have to do the pantheons for 112 percent cause my one save is 110 and I honestly can’t think of anything else to do besides the pantheon of the knight and hollownest
    You have to do all but the last pantheon (hollownest), and each counts as 1%.
        Ahh yeah sadly I’ll be sticking at 110 honestly I don’t enjoy the whole boss rush thing and I feel I’m content where I am I beat sly and I think that’s as far as I’m willing to go with the next one hitting me with double dmg bosses I just don’t care enough to try to continue something I don’t enjoy much already
            You only have to do one more pantheon and then you are done dont give up yet
It took me 131 hours to finish 112%, a good chunk was pantheon of hallownest, it was the last thing I needed to do to get the last trophies on ps4 though
Why not?
    Mostly joking.

If they play for more than 3 minutes, the time will hit 113 hours. There's just something nice about 112% and 112 Hours.
        I have a 112% save with 67 hours, it's my first one too. Two hours until i quit hollow knight
            lol nice

                3 attempts??? BRUH
It took me a while to beat the trial of fools but I can't get past pantheon of the sage. Zote always fucks me up and if I get past him, uumuu finishes me off. I ended up just giving up and completing the game without finishing the pantheons
    Uumuu should be a chance to heal yourself fully and get max soul (you can dream nail Uumuu even if it's not vulnerable), just be patient and don't hit the jellyfish into Uumuu unless you have a perfect shot.
no fookin way, 5th trial of Godhome has  every boss in it including the asshole hard ones.
    You don't need to do p5 for 112
        Really? What about p4? I’m at 109% and the only things I haven’t done are NKG and pantheons 3-5 so I’m wondering what will give the percentages I need.
            Yeah you need p4 just not p5. The wiki shows everything needed for 112.
            I think you're also missing the completion of the hunters journal.
                Hunter's Journal is not a percent.
                    What? It should be
                        That's not the discussion...
                    Ah you're right.
                I assumed that the last few bosses in P5 are what my hunters journal is missing, do you not need them for the journal?
                    Nope. Oro and Mato, Sheo, Sly, Pure Vessel, etc. all increase both the numerator and denominator of the hunter's journal, so they're not required for completion and don't actually "help" you complete more. All the Grimm content, all Zote variants, and White Defender aren't needed either.
                        interesting....I wonder what the heck I'm missing then because my hunter journal has info for all the monsters on there
            P4 counts. Are you on PC? There's a save game analyzer tool that I started using once I knocked out the first ending. Click on the "Spoilers" checkbox to show locations, and everything links out to wiki pages.

https://reznormichael.github.io/hollow-knight-completion-check/
            That's your 3% right there. Once you beat NKG you will get 1%, and pantheon 3 and 4 will give you the other 2%. You're almost there :)
Not all of godhome just pantheons 1 through 4
I find trial of the fool pretty easy although I did beat NKG before I attempted it lol.
Tbh trial of fool was easier than godhome
Can you copy the save file to a separate column and play that one?
    It’s been a while since I played the game so I don’t remember if that’s an option or not. But honestly I’ve already played the hell out of Hollow Knight. Played it 5 or 6 times to get all achievements. got 100% twice and 112% twice. On the Nintendo switch, all my save slots are full. Don’t think I’ll be deleting one to play again unless Silksong takes like a year to drop and I get an itch to explore Hallownest again.
Ugh I’m at like 150 and still haven’t finished the last god home
    You dont need the fifth pantheon for 112%
theres a certain gamemode where you start with everything unlocked, you start in godhome, and you cant leave
    omg how did I not know about this!! So it’s basically just a boss rush mini version of the game?
        Yup, it's pretty nifty. https://hollowknight.fandom.com/wiki/Godseeker_Mode
I put the godmaster spawn I dont remeber the exact name
When you start a new file, you can choose between a normal game, steel soul game, or Godseeker mode. Godseeker mode requires the first three pantheons to have been beaten on another file and allows the player to start right in Godhome with all charms and spells/abilities unlocked.
You beat the pantheon but not the trail of fools?
    The pantheon was pretty easy for me (except zote), and you don’t need the 4th or 5th for 112. I beat 4th anyways but TotF is still hard for me for some reason I can’t get past the floorless section
        You do need to finish Pantheon 4 for a completion percentage. You're right about Pantheon 5 not being necessary, though.
        Use nail arts and vengeful spirit. The charms for those two help a lot as well. Sometimes you may need to pogo on enemies as well.

About 112% do all the mask shards soul vessals count?
            Yeah you need all masks and soul vessels meaning that stupid flower quest was needed lmao
                Pain peko.
        I got past the floorless part by just pogoing enemies as much as possible, and I had the sharp shadow charm so every time I shade dashed through enemies it dealt damage. I've seen people suggest hiveblood but that only works if you're good enough at dodging to get a mask back between hits
I beat it but can't beat the dlc boss
    Grimm or big grimm? If its them, their fights are like a dance - they do one attack which has one or two openings for your to hit them, then do another very shortly after. Get comfortable dodging before even trying to also get hits in. Ince you're able to dodge each attack individually, you can dodge the whole fight. Select a few of their attacks that you're most comfortable with and choose those to be the ones you get damage in on. For me that was the fire bat one and the upward fire spout one.

Or if you mean just normal grimm, you could equip every spell charm and unbreakable heart and then tank him while abyss shrieking him from beneath until you win.
        I've tried idk. It's the final phase of Grimm. Hes so fast and takes two health every hit. Tough asf
            If you only want the completion percentage, and not to beat the boss, you could always go back to the howling cliffs and banish the grimm troupe. If gives the percent that beating nkg would.
                How does this work?
                    When collecting the final flames for the ritual, you find brumm in deepnest. He tells you that he doesn't want to be part of the endless cycle of the grimm troupe, and that you can banish them and break the cycle if you go back to where you summoned them the first time. When you're there, I think you just wack the lantern a  bunch and then the grimm troupe will be gone. Brumm will show up in dirtmouth as Nymm, and you'll replace your grimmchild charm with carefree melody. 
Instead of the Ritual achievement, you get Banishment.
Pantheon 5 isn't required for 112% tho
    Last 3 then, I have 3, 4 and the final one to go. Nailmaster sly is being a pain
Hahaha. NO
I beat it
    Oh that's cool.. How much time did it take you?
        Its on the pic
            I was talking about how much time did it take you for the Colosseum of fools alone? Unless you devoted 112 hours of your time to the Colosseum?
                No when i took the photo i had already beat it
                    He is asking how long it took you to beat the trial of fools specifically not the entirety of the game.
                        Oh a few tries probs half an hour
                    Oh okay.
The reason i spent this much time is because I was struggling a LOT to beat it and I also spent several hours lost
    I would have 100% given up and looked up a walkthrough at that point. I also never beat Godhome because it was way more effort than it was worth. Wasn’t enjoyable after a certain point and there’s better ways to spend free time.
        I did several times but yhe game is too much fun
            Welp, different strokes I guess
This game has easily 100+ hours content to offer + you can do achievements, beat it in other game mode, master bosses on radiant diff, also there are a lot of mods, and all that for such a low price if you have played only 40 hours you didnt saw half of the content.. maybe on yt. I dont understand honestly whats wrong with playing the game you like.. some people just want to master one game if they like it, maybe you havent found that one good game yourself that you are ready to spent so much hours in.
Maybe the problem is that there aren't other videogames that are interesting that I have discovered yet and that's the reason some people pump crazy numbers into the games that are interesting.
    If Hollow Knight is the only game you find interesting, then you have a much bigger problem. There are SO many amazing games out there, I really don’t think that’s a good enough reason.
        There are alot of amazing games out there but personally games like hollowknight and dark souls are so unique that you only satisfy their itch by playing that game. Everyone has different vices and preferences and I would argue its out of the norm to not play games this way.
Crazy how different people can enjoy different things in a game, right?

Completion is its own reward. To know you've overcome something through great trial and tribulation is quite exhilarating. It's no different than people who try to beat world record speed runs, or try to ladder to the top of competitive games like Hearthstone or Overwatch.

Some people game for achievement, completion, and mastery. Try on some empathy and seeing it from their perspective. To you, attempting something for the 50th time might feel stale, and like a bad excuse for content. To me, someone who plays for mastery, that 50th attempt is as much a part of the game content as the first attempt was.

Hollow Knight is a masocore game. It attracts a certain type of player, eg. people with a much higher tolerance for repetition, and a lower tolerance for quitting are going to have their hands all over a game like this.
What do you mean?
    It's not progress, it's for the places you've been on the map.  You can get 112% and not finish the game.
        if you have 112% that means they done everything at least once except Radiance,
PoH, PoP, ~~White Flower~~ and Hunters Jounal, which they may or may not have done. But the 112% tracks far more than just “have you been everywhere”
            I think you have to do white flower since mask shards count for completion
                Oh i forgot it gave a shard, will edit.
            Yep it tracks charms collected, certain bosses defeated as well as the DLCs
        It is progress. You can search for what each act does for percentage of completion. You can register 112% complete in inventory without actually finishing the game (as in not defeating final boss(es)), but to get the achievements/quests, you have to finish the game.
        If i open my map it says 112% complete
            Sorry inventory
        No you need to beat the game to get 112%.
            I did
        Thats literally not true in the slightest. Where did you even pull this out of?
        It is progress! No doubt about it.
        You are just tacitly wrong.
            Who is wrong pls help Im confused
No no ignore that
112 hour boys stick together
The pantheon of hallownest is not required for 112%
    Imma do it anyway
Thats when I finished it
The trial of the fool
    Mmmm noice
You have to do all but the last pantheon (hollownest), and each counts as 1%.
    Ahh yeah sadly I’ll be sticking at 110 honestly I don’t enjoy the whole boss rush thing and I feel I’m content where I am I beat sly and I think that’s as far as I’m willing to go with the next one hitting me with double dmg bosses I just don’t care enough to try to continue something I don’t enjoy much already
        You only have to do one more pantheon and then you are done dont give up yet
Mostly joking.

If they play for more than 3 minutes, the time will hit 113 hours. There's just something nice about 112% and 112 Hours.
    I have a 112% save with 67 hours, it's my first one too. Two hours until i quit hollow knight
        lol nice
        There’s no way, show proof, that’s insane lol
            That’s not too bad I had a very similar first time and so did many others on this sub
            Ive had 112% in 47 hrs with proof!
                I've had 112% in -6 hours but my dog ate my computer so sadly i can't show you...
                    Oh dont worry, i have proof, check i posted it last week
                        I wasn't doubting your acheivment, i was just trying to make a joke. I'd still like to see the screenshot tho
                            It is in my profile posted one week ago on this sub
        Ooo, look at you, Mr. Fancy. If we are flexing I have a 112% at 47 hours!! Check the post history 😤
            i have a save file at 1 hour, hahahaha
                Lmaoo nice
                    I have a steel soul file at (     ) hours.
Understandable
    SAME
        If you guys find trail of fools harder i might have an easier time at the pantheon.
            Personally I found trial of the fool a lot easier than the pantheons. At least easier than pantheon 3 which is the one im currently on. I guess it all depends on whether or not you're better at fighting bosses or fighting lots of enemies.
                The enemies are more random I feel like
                    They spawn in a set order so I just had to remember which ones came when and then it was ok
                        Those bugs above that shoot goop while spikes are below is hardest part imo
                            Primal aspids are the worst
                            The spike floor part is definitely the toughest bit. I don't know if you already do, but I've used hiveblood for that so I can still heal
                            that was hardest part for me as well, you have to learn to practice the downswipe jump bounce for that part.
                Beat trial of the fool on my first serious attempt but gave up on pantheon 3 after a week and haven’t been back
                I second this the fool I did in a couple of tries but knowing the trial of the knight starts to have double mask guys I’m not even gonna touch that I beat sage and that’s as far as I’m willing to go I already don’t like boss rush things and theres no chance I’m gonna do a boss rush but some things do double dmg fuck that
            [removed]
                If you mean the ToF i just use nail arts and vengeful spirit. I use the charms for them too. Also dont forget you can pogo on enemies.
                    Also pogo resets your monarch wings
                        That too.
                    [removed]
                        With the build i go with and having gone through many tries and finally learning the order and move set of the enemies yeah it becomes easier. I mean before i watched the youtube video with the nail only run i was stuck for so long. 

It been a long while since ive played so ill prob screw up.
            Pantheon 5 is the hardest IMO, I still haven't beaten it and it's a very long boss rush, but only the first 4 pantheons are required for 112%. ToF 3 is not nearly as bad, and I managed to do it before I fully upgraded my nail.
                Is that the one with the Pale Champion? I generally dont find it it that bad but then again thats me saying it after i found out how to handle the enemies.
            It's different for everyone. I had 3 nail upgrades and beat each level of the Trial without dying once. Then I died twice to Elder Hu :P
                Kudos to you for doing them all first try. Man im so envious of you. I cant quite say i remember how many tries i did on bosses so lets just say it took a couple. 🎂
    oh man nah the 4th pantheon is harder than all of the colosseum trials put together
        I actually found the fourth pantheon pretty easy it only took me 3 attempts to beat it but I understand fully why you would find it difficult
            3 attempts??? BRUH
Uumuu should be a chance to heal yourself fully and get max soul (you can dream nail Uumuu even if it's not vulnerable), just be patient and don't hit the jellyfish into Uumuu unless you have a perfect shot.

                    That too.

                    With the build i go with and having gone through many tries and finally learning the order and move set of the enemies yeah it becomes easier. I mean before i watched the youtube video with the nail only run i was stuck for so long. 

It been a long while since ive played so ill prob screw up.
        Pantheon 5 is the hardest IMO, I still haven't beaten it and it's a very long boss rush, but only the first 4 pantheons are required for 112%. ToF 3 is not nearly as bad, and I managed to do it before I fully upgraded my nail.
            Is that the one with the Pale Champion? I generally dont find it it that bad but then again thats me saying it after i found out how to handle the enemies.
        It's different for everyone. I had 3 nail upgrades and beat each level of the Trial without dying once. Then I died twice to Elder Hu :P
            Kudos to you for doing them all first try. Man im so envious of you. I cant quite say i remember how many tries i did on bosses so lets just say it took a couple. 🎂
oh man nah the 4th pantheon is harder than all of the colosseum trials put together
    I actually found the fourth pantheon pretty easy it only took me 3 attempts to beat it but I understand fully why you would find it difficult
        3 attempts??? BRUH
Really? What about p4? I’m at 109% and the only things I haven’t done are NKG and pantheons 3-5 so I’m wondering what will give the percentages I need.
    Yeah you need p4 just not p5. The wiki shows everything needed for 112.
    I think you're also missing the completion of the hunters journal.
        Hunter's Journal is not a percent.
            What? It should be
                That's not the discussion...
            Ah you're right.
        I assumed that the last few bosses in P5 are what my hunters journal is missing, do you not need them for the journal?
            Nope. Oro and Mato, Sheo, Sly, Pure Vessel, etc. all increase both the numerator and denominator of the hunter's journal, so they're not required for completion and don't actually "help" you complete more. All the Grimm content, all Zote variants, and White Defender aren't needed either.
                interesting....I wonder what the heck I'm missing then because my hunter journal has info for all the monsters on there
    P4 counts. Are you on PC? There's a save game analyzer tool that I started using once I knocked out the first ending. Click on the "Spoilers" checkbox to show locations, and everything links out to wiki pages.

https://reznormichael.github.io/hollow-knight-completion-check/
    That's your 3% right there. Once you beat NKG you will get 1%, and pantheon 3 and 4 will give you the other 2%. You're almost there :)
Yup, it's pretty nifty. https://hollowknight.fandom.com/wiki/Godseeker_Mode
You do need to finish Pantheon 4 for a completion percentage. You're right about Pantheon 5 not being necessary, though.
Use nail arts and vengeful spirit. The charms for those two help a lot as well. Sometimes you may need to pogo on enemies as well.

About 112% do all the mask shards soul vessals count?
    Yeah you need all masks and soul vessels meaning that stupid flower quest was needed lmao
        Pain peko.
I got past the floorless part by just pogoing enemies as much as possible, and I had the sharp shadow charm so every time I shade dashed through enemies it dealt damage. I've seen people suggest hiveblood but that only works if you're good enough at dodging to get a mask back between hits
I've tried idk. It's the final phase of Grimm. Hes so fast and takes two health every hit. Tough asf
    If you only want the completion percentage, and not to beat the boss, you could always go back to the howling cliffs and banish the grimm troupe. If gives the percent that beating nkg would.
        How does this work?
            When collecting the final flames for the ritual, you find brumm in deepnest. He tells you that he doesn't want to be part of the endless cycle of the grimm troupe, and that you can banish them and break the cycle if you go back to where you summoned them the first time. When you're there, I think you just wack the lantern a  bunch and then the grimm troupe will be gone. Brumm will show up in dirtmouth as Nymm, and you'll replace your grimmchild charm with carefree melody. 
Instead of the Ritual achievement, you get Banishment.
Its on the pic
    I was talking about how much time did it take you for the Colosseum of fools alone? Unless you devoted 112 hours of your time to the Colosseum?
        No when i took the photo i had already beat it
            He is asking how long it took you to beat the trial of fools specifically not the entirety of the game.
                Oh a few tries probs half an hour
            Oh okay.
I did several times but yhe game is too much fun
    Welp, different strokes I guess
There are alot of amazing games out there but personally games like hollowknight and dark souls are so unique that you only satisfy their itch by playing that game. Everyone has different vices and preferences and I would argue its out of the norm to not play games this way.
if you have 112% that means they done everything at least once except Radiance,
PoH, PoP, ~~White Flower~~ and Hunters Jounal, which they may or may not have done. But the 112% tracks far more than just “have you been everywhere”
    I think you have to do white flower since mask shards count for completion
        Oh i forgot it gave a shard, will edit.
    Yep it tracks charms collected, certain bosses defeated as well as the DLCs
It is progress. You can search for what each act does for percentage of completion. You can register 112% complete in inventory without actually finishing the game (as in not defeating final boss(es)), but to get the achievements/quests, you have to finish the game.
If i open my map it says 112% complete
    Sorry inventory
No you need to beat the game to get 112%.
    I did
Thats literally not true in the slightest. Where did you even pull this out of?
It is progress! No doubt about it.
You are just tacitly wrong.
    Who is wrong pls help Im confused
You only have to do one more pantheon and then you are done dont give up yet
lol nice
There’s no way, show proof, that’s insane lol
    That’s not too bad I had a very similar first time and so did many others on this sub
    Ive had 112% in 47 hrs with proof!
        I've had 112% in -6 hours but my dog ate my computer so sadly i can't show you...
            Oh dont worry, i have proof, check i posted it last week
                I wasn't doubting your acheivment, i was just trying to make a joke. I'd still like to see the screenshot tho
                    It is in my profile posted one week ago on this sub
Ooo, look at you, Mr. Fancy. If we are flexing I have a 112% at 47 hours!! Check the post history 😤
    i have a save file at 1 hour, hahahaha
        Lmaoo nice
            I have a steel soul file at (     ) hours.
If you guys find trail of fools harder i might have an easier time at the pantheon.
    Personally I found trial of the fool a lot easier than the pantheons. At least easier than pantheon 3 which is the one im currently on. I guess it all depends on whether or not you're better at fighting bosses or fighting lots of enemies.
        The enemies are more random I feel like
            They spawn in a set order so I just had to remember which ones came when and then it was ok
                Those bugs above that shoot goop while spikes are below is hardest part imo
                    Primal aspids are the worst
                    The spike floor part is definitely the toughest bit. I don't know if you already do, but I've used hiveblood for that so I can still heal
                    that was hardest part for me as well, you have to learn to practice the downswipe jump bounce for that part.
        Beat trial of the fool on my first serious attempt but gave up on pantheon 3 after a week and haven’t been back
        I second this the fool I did in a couple of tries but knowing the trial of the knight starts to have double mask guys I’m not even gonna touch that I beat sage and that’s as far as I’m willing to go I already don’t like boss rush things and theres no chance I’m gonna do a boss rush but some things do double dmg fuck that
