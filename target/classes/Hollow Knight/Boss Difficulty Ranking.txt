[[Boss Difficulty Ranking]]


There are plenty of these out there, but after doing all the speedrun and steel soul achievements, I felt like I had a decent idea of what bosses were genuinely difficult, and which were just hard because of fighting them early on.

Rules

\-Dream Bosses will be included, Dream Warriors will not.

\-I will take into account the upgrades you would be likely to have as you progressed (like monarch wings or nail upgrades), but not the extra skill you would acquire after spending a long time in the game.

Boss Ranking

**28. False Knight**

The first boss I found in the game, and you don't want a first boss to be hard. He may seem intimidating to a new player, and a death to this guy is respectable on the first encounter. However, all his attacks have extremely long windups and it's easy to pile huge amounts of damage in. A great first boss, but first bosses should be down here at the bottom of the list. I never died to this boss.

**27. Gruz Mother**

You know a boss is easy when I have to justify not placing it last. The fact is is that Gruz Mother has one attack (her dash) that still damages me now. False Knight has no attacks that damage me at all. Yes, this boss is easy, and maybe shouldn't be a boss at all, but it also could be a players first boss if they explore in a different order. I died once to this boss.

**26. Hornet (Greenpath)**

This boss, found in the second area, gave me a lot of trouble on my first playthrough and almost made me quit the game. Hornet is much faster than False Knight, and has less attack signalling. She has a wide variety of attacks, but is still quite easy to dodge once you know what you're doing, and it's only because it's placed early in the game that it could present a challenge for some players. I died 14 times to this boss.

**25. Soul Master**

I continue to go in the sequential order of this game when making the list. Soul Master is an intimidating boss for players first starting the game, and the huge walk back to the boss is frustrating, especially as it's packed with soul twisters. However, when he does his tracking soul balls ability, just walk towards the boss and the ball will fly over your head and you can pile damage into Soul Master. I died twice to this boss.

**24. Broken Vessel**

The other bosses here are early game bosses, and so should be easy as the player isn't very skilled at the game. This boss is late game, after the player has picked up a large amount of abilities and skills. And the boss is easy. Jump over his dash. Walk under his air dash. Stand a little to the side of his down dash. Walk to the edge of the arena and heal when he spews infection everywhere. Bringing Defenders Crest turns this fight from easy to insultingly easy. I never died to this boss.

**23. Uumuu**

Waiting Simulator: The Boss. Uumuu can only be attacked infrequently when his jellyfish bubble is burst by >!Quirrel.!< In the interlude, Uumuu uses easy-to-dodge attacks. The only reason this is as high as it is is because the fight is so LONG, and I ended up taking dumb damage because of the long waits and my impatience. This boss is found late in the game and so isn't that hard even for a first-time player. I died once to this boss.

**22. Nosk**

Here we get into bosses that I still found a bit challenging on my second run. To dodge Nosk, hug the area just before the rise in the floor. He can't really hit you here, but you can hit him. However, you must constantly change which side of the arena you hug, due to his run attack. I got hit here sometimes, preventing me from placing this boss any lower. I died 3 times to this boss.

**21. Flukemarm**

Apart from having terrible design, Flukemarm is a litmus test for 'can you one hit the gross things he spawns from his one attack'. If you can, just pogo on his head for a free win. If you can't this fight might give you some trouble. I died twice to this boss.

**20. Mantis Lords**

A very fun boss, I can't wait to see a dream version, like Team Cherry has hinted. There isn't really much to say here, the boss has very average difficulty and a good variety of fair attacks. I suspect it would be harder if you fought this boss before going to City of Tears. I died 4 times to this boss.

**19. Brooding Mawlek**

Gave me a very hard time on my first playthrough, as despite the fact that it was optional, is gave the last shard I needed to get my first mask. His attacks are kinda difficult to dodge, but with practice all his attacks can be dodged easily. The 'shoots infection across the half the entire arena' gave me the most trouble, but he just needs to be dashed over. I died 6 times to this boss.

**18. The Collector**

This boss is fought very late on, after the player has shadow dash and has explored Queen's Gardens. The enemies he spawns give the most trouble, but I had fought him with a pure nail every time I fought him, so all of them got one hit. If the player was less leveled, the fight would be harder, so despite never dying here, many people would have. I never died to this boss.

**17. Soul Tyrant**

The first Dream Boss here, Soul Tyrant isn't that hard. If you have the double jump, the fakeout ground pound won't get you. His spinny orb attack can be tricky, but gives you so much healing time afterwards that the fight becomes fairly easy. However, he is a dream boss, and will certainly kill you at least once. I died 5 times to this boss.

**16. Crystal Guardian (Part I)**

The only tricky attack for this fight is when he fires a laser at you. Once I had mastered this move, the fight was trivial. This move takes some mastering, however, and so the boss isn't that easy. I died 7 or 8 times to this boss.

**15. Grimm**

The DLC bosses tend to be harder than the other bosses. Grimm is a fun boss with a good variety of attacks. However, he isn't a cakewalk. His attacks take some learning to get used to, but he can be killed without much hassle. I died twice to this boss.

**14. Dung Defender**

DOBA DOBA DOBADOBADOBA AH-HAH-HAH!

**13. Crystal Guardian (Part II)**

Like I mentioned above in the Part I, once you learn his one hard attack, he's easy. He does do double damage, so the fight is objectively harder. But since the first part is required before fighting the second part, by the time you get to this boss, you probably have the timing down on his attack. I died once to this boss.

**12. Lost Kin**

Unlike Crystal Guardian, this fight is actually a difficulty increase from Broken Vessel. The boss is faster and more difficult, but isn't ridiculously so. I died 11 times to this boss.

**11. Hive Knight**

This was the first boss since Hornet (Greenpath) that frustrated me. The walk to the boss is annoying, and I highly recommend Dreamgate before attempting. He has tricky to dodge attacks and zips around the arena. When he starts spawning bees is when it gets really hard. I died about 15 times to this boss.

**10. God Tamer**

I'll be honest and say that I cheesed this boss with Hiveblood, so I don't know how hard it is to actually fight. But after the Trial of the Fool, the least thing you want to do is die to the final boss. It looked about this difficult though. I never died to this boss.

**9. White Defender**

Dung Defender got a power buff, and this turns him into a fun late game challenge. All his attacks are harder, and he has a new one that basically requires you to have shadow dash. I really enjoyed this fight, and went on to do all 5 refights. I died 8 times to this boss on the first fight.

**8. Hollow Knight**

The final boss of the game is in an awkward position. If it was too hard, people who rushed through the game would find it unfair, and fighting the Radiance would be really annoying. I think the fight is easy if you are maxed with a pure nail, but on my 5hr speedrun I had a 3rd tier nail and 5 health. Here the fight was actually living up to the name of 'final boss'. I died 12 times to this boss. (combined total from my first playthrough and 5hr speedrun)

**7. Hornet (Kingdom's Edge)**

Hornet unleashes her full strength at you here. The arena is atmospheric, and the fight has kicked into another level of speed. This is probably the second fastest-paced boss in the game. The fight would be very doable except now Hornet places spiked balls all over the arena. You have to hit them away. This provides just the right amount of difficulty to make you take damage. I died 18 times here.

**6. Grey Prince Zote**

My least favorite boss in the game, the gold statue is the only thing I have left to complete, and I'm not doing it. His attacks are frustratingly difficult to predict, and it took me ages to just beat his first level. I have died 20-30 times to this boss.

**5. Failed Champion**

They threw everything they could into making the False Knight dream variant harder than the first boss. Double Damage, Absurdly Fast Attacks, and Infected rocks falling from the sky. The infected rocks, like the spiked balls in the Hornet fight, turned this from easy to difficult. I died 20-30 times in this fight.

**4. Watcher Knights**

The hardest boss for a speedrun playthrough, the strategy for beating Watcher Knights ordinarily for me was facetank. In a speedrun, I was underleveled and couldn't do that. When they both roll in different patterns towards you, it feels impossible to succeed. This was the only boss I used spells for. I died 30 - 40 times in this fight.

**3. Traitor Lord**

The buffed Traitor Lord certainly deserves his place as a guardian of >!half of the Kingsoul!<. He is fast and has a wide variety of attacks, and deals double damage. I can see many people quitting the game due to the difficulty of this boss. I died to this boss on Steel Soul mode.   :(

**2. The Radiance**

There probably aren't any surprises waiting at the top of this list. The True Final Boss is a fiendishly difficult fight, with a massive array of attacks. She is hard to hit, and hard to avoid getting hit by. This boss implements every mechanic of the game and puts them all to the test. The full screen title and >!being the literal sun!< made me gulp the first time I entered the fight. I only died 18 times to this fight, though it felt like more due to having to fight Hollow Knight.

**1. Nightmare King Grimm**

Surprise! This guy. Almost unanimously the hardest boss, NKG is a challenge on another level. The dream version of Grimm, NKG also rocks a full screen title card and an awesome OST (seriously, check it out if you haven't beat him already). The OST is probably the only reason I had any will left to continue this fight, but it was rewarding to beat.

I died precisely 182 times to NKG. (yes, I kept count)


>Traitor Lord

>I died to this boss on Steel Soul mode

You do... you do know you don't have to fight the radiance for steel heart, right?
    Dammit.
    You do have to get at least 100% though. Without going and counting it all up, there might be seven things harder than TL to beat.
        You don't need to beat Traitor Lord for 100&#37;. Recently completed a Steel Heart run and was only missing the following for 107&#37;: Traitor Lord, Kingsoul, Grubberfly's Elegy, Trial of the Fool, Grimm, NKG, and the mask completion. So no, he's not required for 100&#37;.
It's interesting how certain bosses difficulty change so much from person to person
    It's related to your nail upgrades and the abilities you have available.

The Hollow Knight is cake when you fight him with the Pure Nail + Life Blood Charms and Masks.

The Hollow Knight is pretty difficult when you have the base health and damage.
>Gruz Mother

>his

ok
    fixed
fyi you don't need the shade cloak to get to the Collector
    Yeah you can get there almost as soon as you get the love key
Flukemarm is female

Also could we get a second list for the warrior dreams? It would be nice
White defender is ridiculously easy. Stand at the far left and he can damn near never hit you.
    But you can also damn near never hit him that way
I had a lot of trouble with Traitor Lord, died to him like 40 times (used dream gate). Then I changed my build to Dashmaster + Sprintmaster + health and beat him on my 2nd try.
Traitor lord is easy if you jump up and slightly away [like I did during my hitless attempt](https://youtu.be/1LqvOUrKrQg) during either of his dash attacks and save your dash for certain situations.  If you're good you can keep sharp shadowing through him between his attacks but I found it hard to do consistently.  Throw in some smacks between attacks and he drops before you know it. 
    Thanks, I'm gonna try this.
182 times? What the fuck??? I 107% Hollow Knight and I'm positive I suffered less deaths than that in my whole play-through. Glad I choose banishment over Ritual and didn't have to go through him but still... 182 ? ? ? 
    I don’t think anyone should get 182 deaths on one boss. You’d have to completely forget all the attacks each time and literally never improve. It took me like 20 consecutive tries, and I can understand even 40, but 182? How?
        I am terrible at games, but have great perseverance.
            Old post I know but, mad respect for u trying so many times and overcoming it.

I'm currently on my 30th death and only just got him to do the first bullethell attack... 

Mind sharing your charm loadout? 
                Grimmchild Strength Mark of pride Lifeblood core
                I would suggest having Shape of Unn + Quick Focus. It can help you with healing during the fire pillar attack, at least it worked really well for me. Also, Mark of Pride or Longnail can be used to reach NKG easily when he fires those red bats at you. 
        because some people are not the same as you
        IKR 
            Pretty sure I didn't die that many times even in cuphead lol.
False Knight was harder than Hornet for me.
    I’m so sorry
This is the first list I think I almost totally agree with. Nice job putting this together and giving an explanation for your decisions

    He said not including dream warriors
The hive Knight is easy..

Traitor Lord is ok once you master shadow dash timing.

Flukerman is a bit harder than that I think.

Brooding mawlek and zote aren't that hard.

Watcher Knight is Hell

    It's all subjective and depends on each player.

For me the Watchers wasn't as hard as hive or brooding . 
    Let me guess: you fought Hive Knight on a 106% completed file when Lifeblood came out.
        No.. I had three vessel upgrade, two masks upgrade and the coiled nail
    It really depends on the player
Failed champion is the easiest boss imo, just abuse its bad ai
Run to one corner of the arena, and he is guaranteed to do a leap smash, which gives you a window to do a few hits and then run to the other side as he sends easily dodgeable shockwaves, until he runs to you and once again does a leap smash, just abuse this strategy and it’s easy
    For sure mate, easier than gruz mother even

&#x200B;
        Gruz mother is op, don’t disrespect her
Dammit.
