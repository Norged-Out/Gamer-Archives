[[An incredibly grim theory about the nature of blood]]


After all the new lore surrounding the Gutterman and the Earthmovers, I started thinking about how blood is used as a fuel in the first place. After all, blood doesn’t have much potential energy when burned (a fact seemingly consistent in Ultrakill since blood does not catch fire), so how is it powering things?

This got me thinking more and more about the nature of blood itself. Questions like “Why can Prime Souls and Cerberi bleed” came up. And in particular, the capability of Prime Souls to bleed leads me to believe that blood has *some* link to the soul.

Now, that on its own doesn’t feel like enough to establish a link, but there’s more. Pretty much all of the machines are weapons of war, so why do so many of them seem to have some degree of personality? Mindflayers get angry when their body is damaged, Streetcleaners scream when they fall, Swordmachines grunt in pain when hurt, and all machines *want* more blood to survive. A weapon of war has no need of a personality, yet they possess one, and I believe that is because the blood within them has granted them some aspect of a soul.

This is all pretty interesting on its own, but connecting it all to the Gutterman somehow makes that thing even more fucked up. Its lore states that it needs a live subject in order to keep acquiring blood, but all of the bodies in their backs are skeletons, so they should be dead; however, all the body needs in order to produce red blood cells is bone marrow and nutrients, so the cells within are likely still alive if the Gutterman is still able to function.

Where this gets truly grim is the idea that some fragment of their soul is still trapped within. After all, they can still bleed, so something of them still remains. Their minds may have atrophied long ago, but the fact that their bones are stained with bloody tears indicates that they’re still capable of some kind of lament, pain, or fear.

TLDR; Blood is linked to the soul in some way which is why it can be used as fuel, also somehow the Gutterman is *even more* fucked up than you thought.


I think the earthmovers are a replica made by hell. It is too crudely constructed and uses idols as shields.
    They are a replica, the pinnicle of humanity's cruelty against itself, but the fleshy parts were in the original

We know that other machines who appear on previous layers are from the surface.
        I have a crackpot theory, the gutterman is the punishment for 7-2. People live in guttermen, forever suffering from the consequences of war.
            Not really. In dante's Inferno it was the boiling River of blood as Seen in 7-2 as Well.
            No, but hell liked the guttermen so much it made its own replicas, the mannequins.

    All im saying is if hell is replicating the machines of earth, whats to say we’ll never see a V1 hell edition?
        We may see it in the climax
 fraud  layer.
I think this means that V1, and basically every other machine, is an amalgamation of souls from every single being that it got blood from. 

...Huh.
    As the saying goes, " fnaf is just loss for videogame lore"
        ive never heard that saying, but its completely valid
    This is the canonical explanation for us playing as V1 in ULTRAKILL (/j... Maybe)
Well, the blood is the nectar of the Tree of Life in Ultrakill as 7-1 book says, it posesses the life energy. Though, not sure if blood is connected to souls, souls seem to be human-only thing that allow humans to manifest as Husks, Lesser Angels and rarely Prime Souls, but blood is in every living thing, in Demons under their stone shells and in Greater and Supreme Angels.
    Hello express
    The blood might be a link to the soul like how Hell works in Doom (argent energy) its the soul wich gives the power to the machines.
Streetcleaners scream when they fall because Hakita thought it would be funny.

        yeah lol, if we are going to make everything matter to lore, then everything will matter to lore
According to the diary in 7-1, Blood isn't merely a body part. But a divine substance that is the source of all life. When God created the world, he planted the tree of life. And from the fruit of this tree came blood, for which he crafted vessels which became life. To quote said diary:

&#x200B;

"The unending halls of the Garden! Ah, so dutifully decorated by the  cross, the symbol that angels use for the Tree of Life. They praise their beloved Father who had planted it and filled us with the dew of  its leaves and the nectar of its fruit, that which gives us life,  courses through our veins... 

For you however, our truth: Our bodies are not a vessel for the  blood of the fruit, but its prison. The beautiful guts and gorgeous bone  YEARN to be shown and seen! SPLAYED! Under the divine cross of the Tree  of Life, we pay it tribute through the art of violence."

&#x200B;

As for the machines, we know they are bio-mechanical amalgamations due to being able to go inside the 1000-THR "Earthmover", along with further conformation from Hakita. The guttermen; being the first machines; are probably more mechanical than most due to engineers not having figured out how to graft iron and flesh yet. Hence why they need a live specimen too store blood for them.

&#x200B;

TL;DR you're right about the soul thing, though you didn't quite take the right road to get there.
Street cleaners, swordmachines and mindflayers weren't always war machines, street cleaners are modified air purification robots fitted with flame throwers and a more twisted idea of "purity", swordmachine was a robot of unknown function (likely production/construction) who salvaged other machines for parts, the sword and gun weren't originally part of the design, and mindflayers are likely just robotic therapists that have managed to control hell energy
    '''''therapists''''' one look at the ultrakill community and the general acts of human depravity across the globe and you can see they might have served some other secondary function, not saying they weren't robotic therapists, I just doubt that they were \*all\* robotic therapists
    Re mindflayers the lore says only the top part is the actual machine, the humanoid part is a plastic shell the mindflayers feel compelled to build for some reason. Looking at just the top part, it looks like some kind of combat drone?
        This upper part looks extremely similar to the defence system of 1000-THR, and they both use similar attacks, do maybe they are connected?
I would like to state that for Both prime souls, the only parts of their body that seemed to have survive ARE their hearts. Both Minos and Sisyphus have hearts and veins suspended in their ethereal forms.

&#x200B;

Even if blood doesn't end up being divine, It seems like A prime soul needs its heart to continue existing, thus they can bleed.
Always thought this was the point. The entire concept of a "hell mass" implies blood carries a metaphysical energy
God dammit it was fnaf all along
    FNAF is the Loss of videogame lore.
Well, blood is considered to be full of life, that's why vampires for example suck it. Maybe machines literally subsist of the energy of life itself? Or maybe the god's light is somehow stored in the blood?
Not sure if this is exactly what hakita thought making this stuff, but yeah the machines definitely are alive in way beyond AI or something
So basically if i put blood in a rock, i get a malicious face?
We can definitely expand on this with the new gutterman book.
Well it still makes sense to assume that they are just bleeding because they have blood. After all the prime sould ARE physical beings and you can clearly see their blood vessels. Its also stated that cerberi and other demons consist of a hard exterior and a flesh interior so its not hard to imagine how they bleed.
