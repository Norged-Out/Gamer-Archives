I hate some of this community
IF she was real, but sadly as her name suggests, she is a mirage, V1 is going through Schizophrenia
    My headcanon is V1 "sleeps" between levels, and that level is V1 "dreaming". And maybe robots dream when they are incompletely shut down because, at least in V1's case, it is BUILT for being hyper, and it is incapable of not at least thinking of movement n stuff
        Do robots dream of‚Ä¶ *anime schoolgirls*???
            Don't we all?
            that sounds like a name for an anime
                Its a reference to "do androids dream of electric sheep?"


The title of an extremely famous sci-fi novel from the 60's
                    Also refrenced in the title of the first song in 7-2
                    Aint that the blade runner tittle?
            Bro is just like me fr fr
            This is amazing
            Yeah
        That‚Äôs a very good headcanon, if robots are truly sentient dreaming may be part of their inactive state. There is the question if they dream of eternal sleep after all. The terminals sadly cannot get to see Mirage tho.

My headcanon is that Mirage may be an AI related to V1 that is still stuck in its head. It could be an assistant type AI, like Cortana. Or the AI of the robot itself before V1 gained ‚Äúlife‚Äù with the blood as fuel. It‚Äôs depressed because it‚Äôs being unused and living in a ‚Äúperfect‚Äù world with no war and no use for it. Maybe a very exaggerated ‚Äúwhat could have been‚Äù for V1? Idk

I just think that she is more important than she looks because she is the only secret level without a testament. Even if she is a dream like your headcanon it still fits because it confirms that robots have consciences and they literally dream too and that‚Äôs kind of important.
        This goes in tandem with my head cannon that all the secret levels are just vivid biblical hallucinations/dreams experienced by V1 on the way between layers.
    why is v1 dreaming of a hot version of itself, is it stupid??
        No. Just lonely
        Gabriel probably told V1 to go fuck itself
        V1 is already a hot version of itself
    this is my new headcanon
    Nuh uh

if v1 drinks the blood he drops after getting hurt would also be a infinite source of fuel
    this would just slow down the process, as v1 is picking up the blood it has just dropped, no blood lost, no blood gained, if v1 is burning fuel to pick up the blood it has lost, its better to just not lose blood in the first place.
        if he's burning fuel to move, wouldn't that make him lose health everytime he moves?
            blood fuel and blood health are 2 different things OR it takes away an unnoticable amount of fuel to be seen on the health bar

The blood wouldn't be fresh
Period blood is 36% blood
And it would probably have piss in it
    mfw infinite fuel at the cost of 1.5x increased damage to yourself
        if you had infinite blood to heal, why would the increased damage matter?
    I don't see how it'd have piss in it, considering it comes from the uterus, not the urethra

People like you are the reason God has left us
maybe me getting banned was a blessing in disguise
and I get banned for a game theory saying that ULTRAKILL is about domestic abuse
    Now I really want to hear your theory
        alright, i forgot most of it but the basics go:

Sisyphus calls you child, implying that you are his child, but by saying "of man" it represents how you're adopted

the flesh panopticon represents a bar, which keeps you safe from him, but he breaks out (gets kicked out) and beats you when he gets home

Minos, however. is much nicer, shown by the many descriptions calling him a kind king, but his judgemental past leaves V1 (his adopted child) with issues

Victims often describe their experience as "hell on earth" and in ULTRAKILL, where is Hell? That's right, on earth.

so by venturing through hell it is an allegory for you getting to the house.

God is your real father, but he left and put you up for adoption

Gabriel is CPS

V2 is your brother that keeps bullying you 

and yeah, that's about it.
            If that‚Äôs true v1 killed his brother
            why does gabriel want to kill us then?
                if you think about it, CPS aren't known for being that good at their jobs
Yeah it works tested it out
    You what?

And yet furry/mlp stuff isnt allowedü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Like I'd understand if there wasn't supposed to be NSFW but everyone, even you, have that rule. You just made that rule for some reason.

It's just dumb. Imagine if someone drew V1 or Father John Ward as a furry, would that be banned?

My headcanon is V1 "sleeps" between levels, and that level is V1 "dreaming". And maybe robots dream when they are incompletely shut down because, at least in V1's case, it is BUILT for being hyper, and it is incapable of not at least thinking of movement n stuff
    Do robots dream of‚Ä¶ *anime schoolgirls*???
        Don't we all?
        that sounds like a name for an anime
            Its a reference to "do androids dream of electric sheep?"


The title of an extremely famous sci-fi novel from the 60's
                Also refrenced in the title of the first song in 7-2
                Aint that the blade runner tittle?
        Bro is just like me fr fr
        This is amazing
        Yeah
    That‚Äôs a very good headcanon, if robots are truly sentient dreaming may be part of their inactive state. There is the question if they dream of eternal sleep after all. The terminals sadly cannot get to see Mirage tho.

My headcanon is that Mirage may be an AI related to V1 that is still stuck in its head. It could be an assistant type AI, like Cortana. Or the AI of the robot itself before V1 gained ‚Äúlife‚Äù with the blood as fuel. It‚Äôs depressed because it‚Äôs being unused and living in a ‚Äúperfect‚Äù world with no war and no use for it. Maybe a very exaggerated ‚Äúwhat could have been‚Äù for V1? Idk

I just think that she is more important than she looks because she is the only secret level without a testament. Even if she is a dream like your headcanon it still fits because it confirms that robots have consciences and they literally dream too and that‚Äôs kind of important.
    This goes in tandem with my head cannon that all the secret levels are just vivid biblical hallucinations/dreams experienced by V1 on the way between layers.
why is v1 dreaming of a hot version of itself, is it stupid??
    No. Just lonely
    Gabriel probably told V1 to go fuck itself
    V1 is already a hot version of itself
this is my new headcanon
Nuh uh

this would just slow down the process, as v1 is picking up the blood it has just dropped, no blood lost, no blood gained, if v1 is burning fuel to pick up the blood it has lost, its better to just not lose blood in the first place.
    if he's burning fuel to move, wouldn't that make him lose health everytime he moves?
        blood fuel and blood health are 2 different things OR it takes away an unnoticable amount of fuel to be seen on the health bar

mfw infinite fuel at the cost of 1.5x increased damage to yourself
    if you had infinite blood to heal, why would the increased damage matter?
I don't see how it'd have piss in it, considering it comes from the uterus, not the urethra
    real¬†
Robots don't piss (I hope)
    Sure real robots don‚Äôt but what about blood powered robots
Now I really want to hear your theory
    alright, i forgot most of it but the basics go:

Sisyphus calls you child, implying that you are his child, but by saying "of man" it represents how you're adopted

the flesh panopticon represents a bar, which keeps you safe from him, but he breaks out (gets kicked out) and beats you when he gets home

Minos, however. is much nicer, shown by the many descriptions calling him a kind king, but his judgemental past leaves V1 (his adopted child) with issues

Victims often describe their experience as "hell on earth" and in ULTRAKILL, where is Hell? That's right, on earth.

so by venturing through hell it is an allegory for you getting to the house.

God is your real father, but he left and put you up for adoption

Gabriel is CPS

V2 is your brother that keeps bullying you 

and yeah, that's about it.
        If that‚Äôs true v1 killed his brother
        why does gabriel want to kill us then?
            if you think about it, CPS aren't known for being that good at their jobs
