[[I think people should stop comparing this game to doom eternal]]





Ultrakill has more in common with Quake than Doom. If only this was like, advertised more. Like maybe with a website URL or something.
    Hmmmm... perhaps something like devil may shake? Devil may shudder? Shiver, perhaps?
        the devil shaker
            Come on man shake that skull
        Devil May shitter
    I think this game is much more of a devil may cry and quake mix, it just makes me really mad that hakita never addressed this
    Are you referring to something ?
        devilmayquake.com
            That's right, i forgot
Yes they are not similar.

(Source: 500hr in DE, 200hr in UK)
    200 hours in United Kingdom? I'm so sorry you had to go through that
        And 500 hours in deutschland bro you might be a nazi
            I read your comment to my favorite German streamer and we both ridiculed you for a while, just so you know
                How much money did you pay him to give a fuck?
i feel like the main difference actually boils down the under the mayo joke thats happening

eternal gives you a bunch of enemies and then a bunch of weapons/tools that counter each enemy, the game then encourages you to connect the dots so to speak.

Ultrakill gives you a bunch of weapons that have alot of interactions, the enemies are there for you murder but *stylishly*

also ultrakill is much faster and mobile which in my 100% biased view means its better
    I think you’re onto something. 

Doom, the guns interact with enemies (ie: shooting weak points to debuff or insta stagger enemies)

Ultrakill, the guns interact with eachother.
        [This review actually talks about that idea](https://youtu.be/QBM3uD207Ak), it's a  great video about how good BOTH games are.
    Doom eternal has better enemies Ultrakill has better bosses
    Doom Eternal has better guns, Ultrakill has better movement, that's how I see it.
Comparing Ultrakill and Doom Eternal is like comparing Minecraft and Terraria.
    Omg is that r/omori micro-celebrity sigma8k
        Here's a sneak peek of /r/OMORI using the [top posts](https://np.reddit.com/r/OMORI/top/?sort=top&t=year) of the year!

    That is actually 100% accurate, how come i didn't realize this...
    Holy shit the subs being invaded
*various coughing noises* under the mayo *various coughing noises*
like holy shit these are two almost entirely different games in different fields its like comparing stardew to animal crossing
They're literally only both set on hell and that's it
    Personally, the hells depicted in the two games are designed so different from each other I forget they're based on the same place.  

The thread that ties the two together for me is the healing system.  Any shooter that forces you to heal by killing enemies is going to draw comparisons.
        Hell in Doom is your generic fiery pit with some rocks, skulls, maybe some unspecified gore.

Ultrakill is based on Dante's Inferno, which to this day is one of the most creative depictions of hell in all of fiction, and in addition Ultrakill takes differs from the source material a lot, with some layers changed a lot (like wrath) and some completely different (gluttony).
            I didn't think Divine Comedy was anything more than Bible Fanfic before delving into it. But after watching Wendigoon's videos on the whole series, it is definitely one of the coolest depictions of Hell. (and Heaven and purgatory tbh)

Some parts of Purgatorio and Paradisio genuinely made me tear up a bit. The parts where >!Virgil finally leaves Dante at the gates of Heaven, after which you realize that Virgil didn't need to walk through the cleansing fire with Dante, but only chose to so that he wouldn't have to do it alone. The part in Paradisio where Beatrice explains to Dante that God had been tending to the Garden of Eden since humanity had been expunged from it in the hopes that we would one day return.!<

I am by no means religious, but these two parts in particular made me tear up a bit.
                To be honest, it IS a Bible fanfic, but a really fucking good one, with a lot of stuff from Greek/Roman mythology. Despite being written 800 years ago, the punishments of hell are still impressive to this day, despite most of them being actually really simple. 

It has some heartwarming moments, but some are pretty fucked up. When getting into it for the first time, I was really curious what the final, and the worst punishment for the treachery layer will be, and I was expecting the worst.

But not this.
                    Oh it definitely is Bible Fanfic, but like you said it is really good. It's just far more than a fanfic.
                    Tbf the Bible is itself a fanfic of the Torah, which is a book written by ancient nomads.
        dooms's healing system is actually really different to ultrakill's when you look into it, 

dooms system requires you to kill and enter a cutscene which forces boss fights to always have weak enemies spawn in to give you free health which interrupts the flow of gameplay and makes bosses less intense

ultrakill requires you to be close and simply deal damage to heal meaning boss fights can be pure 1v1's and it means boss fights flow better and are more intense

its not always better for normal gameplay but for bosses ultrakill's method works much better
            And both systems stand heads above most shooters that use regenerating shields and stim packs.
they’re themed around hell and are movement shooters, that’s where the similarities end. you could add on like “they both have grappling hooks” or “they’re both focused around an unstoppable force”… well yeah, those are common things in movement shooters. 

it’s like comparing minecraft to terraria. they’re both technically sandbox games with emphasis on exploration, and they both use a block-like building system. that’s it. 

i’d also argue ultrakill is much, much further on the movement shooter side of the spectrum than doom eternal is. i love doom eternal and it’s honestly one of my favourite games i have ever played, but it’s simply slower than ultrakill. obviously both are movement shooters, but it’s like vin deisel vs the rock here.
Doom, and also Quake to an extent, is at its heart a resource management game. The newer Doom games take this to an extreme. Do this to get this resource, so you can have enough to get this resource, so you can have enough to get this resource.

I'm not saying this because I think it's a bad thing. I liked Doom Eternal well enough. But it's not what Ultrakill is like at all.
It’s a game where you kill demons to a metal soundtrack. Of course people are gonna compare the two.
I dunno, I mean obviously Ultrakill isn't a copy of Doom Eternal or anything. But I've played both and I think they are pretty similar in gameplay. The fast pace, emphasis on movement and quickly switching between all your weapons to hit different weaknesses. And the banging soundtrack. They're still very different but almost everyone who likes one will like the other imo
    Under the Mayo being an odd exception. I fucking love ultrakill and it's honestly hilarious watching him be so against a game THAT LITERALLY TAKE HIS ADVICE. Seriously, go and watch some of his videos about game design. Ultrakill does all of that, but somehow it's a problem.
I think the best way to resolve this is for ID to release Quake Eternal.
Finally, someone said it. It's sad to see my favourite youtuber have such a bad take on a game that he should have loved by all means.
    He clearly wanted to hate it, for some reason. His opinion doesn't seem genuine at all, man literally beat the first act with the pistol to try and prove that it's not fun
        And now in the new review he just flips back and forth like 

>This game is actually fun

And 

> This game makes you play brain-dead

I have a feeling that by the time we get 1.0 the only thing holding back nayo from making a positive review is his own ego
Why are five people here?
They’re both fast paced movement shooters with many weapons and tools to use so they’re pretty similar but they have 1 crucial difference. Each enemy in doom eternal has a weakness that you usually have to exploit to survive. It’s about killing enemies in the most efficient way possible before you die. Ultrakill is more about killing enemies in the most fun and cool way possible. It still has enemies weaknesses and some weapons work better on certain enemies than others (nailgun on hideous mass, revolver and knuckleblaster on snipers, etc) but style and fun is the main focus of the game.
You're right, it's silly to compare two fast-paced FPS games with blood-based healing mechanics,  an emphasis on switching weapons frequently, animation-cancelling being an intentional and integral part of the gameplay loop, weapons with multiple alt-fires that all drastically their function *except* for the "weapon shoots even faster" alt-fire on the minigun-type weapon, homing rocket spam as an easy but incredibly bland way of dealing with evasive foes, movement options not typical of the genre like a chainable dodge on a rapidly refilling meter with multiple pips and a ludicrously powerful grappling hook, explosive projectiles that reward you for doing something to detonate them yourself instead of simply letting them impact the target normally, touch-of-death combos as the gold standard for skillful play, a story that's ostensibly about wiping out the forces hell but makes an angel the BBEG for at least the first two acts, first-person platforming that's actually decent, a mechanic that rewards deathless runs by turning something in the game gold...

The comparisons aren't for the benefit of those of us who have hundreds of hours in either game, let alone both; and especially not those who've Ultra-Nightmare and/or P-ranked Minos Prime. Of course those of us with plentiful experience and a comprehensive understanding of the fine mechanical details will mostly see the differences at this point! The comparisons are for the sake of newcomers, casual players, and people who aren't sure whether or not to get Ultrakill. If someone likes Doom Eternal, odds are they'll like Ultrakill for very similar reasons. The game getting negatively reviewed by a certain condiment-based "Doomtuber" does literally nothing to change that.
Sorry but it’s without a doubt the closest game to ultra kill and works very well as a fps comparison
    Quake is much more similar in gameplay feel, doom is just so heavily compared since it so happens to also be in hell, and it is a AAA game in recent memory
    All these people coping in the comments because they're tired of the comparison. The truth is: they are very similar games in many ways. I like ULTRAKILL a lot more than I like DE but that doesn't mean I can't admit they have similarities.
        Huh. Fair point man
disagreed. they're extremely similar in many ways
    Like what exactly? Asides for both being fast paced arena shooters set in hell (or partially in eternals case since you go other places too).
        Both have a shotgun, basically the same game.
        They’re about speed and making the most of your wide mobility range, making you feel cool, teaching you the best ways to use your arsenal, badasses fighting through hell. Want me to name more?
why?
    there is nothing doom like in ultrakill except being a fast paced fps shooter
        are you lacking intellectually
            basically
in doom u pick what weapon matches the best for ur opponent
in ultrakill u just pick whatever weapon u want and kill, also try to be stylish
                yeah, that’s why people compare the two, it’s mostly just about ultrakill having a better combat system, also, they came out in similar time frames, to similar audiences, ofc people  going to compare them
BUT… BUT THEY ARE IN HELL, AND UHH UHH THEY BOTH USE GUNS
DE's combat is about how your weapons interact with and counter enemies
Ultrakill is how your weapons interact with eachother and combo
Finally! Someone said that! The only reason people do that, is because both of those games go fast, take place in hell, and were released around the same time period.
ON GOD BRO, DE is a survival shooter and ULTRAKILL is a style shooter, similar sound on the outset but as many before me said, completely different approaches in playstyle and design
If they ever make a new Quake then we'll have a good comparison
Agreed eternal is way too different.
YES

Whenever people say to me Ultrakill is bettar than Eternal I can't help but get kinda defensive for Eternal, even tho I personally prefer Ultrakill.
But ultrakill is better than doom eternal
Think of it if you take Titanfall 2 and Quake before throwing it into the setting of Divine Comedy.
I mean yes, they are totally different, for me, doom is slower and more methodical, and ultrakill is faster and you have no idea what is happening most of the time, but still both are really fun shooters.

The problem I think comes when you want to introduce this game to somebody else, I personally find it easier to compare it to something else and then say some differences, but that may be only a problem I have, if i knew other games more similar and as popular as doom I would probably compare it to that to recommend it to other people
I'd say that ultrakill sacrifices the doom "guns -> enemy weakness" gameplay for "guns -> gun combos". Making less engaging enemies but better gunplay.

Point is it's stupid to compare these games because they use different fps design philosophy
Yeah it's better
Ultrkill has more in common with Minecraft than Quake or any Id game. Where are people's heads at? Bright colors? Worse than cube graphics? Come on, really? Was this a custom engine at all? I would hope it would be, which means it has potential to turn into something graphically like Prodeus or Scathe. But as it is it looks terrible. Kudos to the programmers but it's way too "flashy" for me to play.
IDK... as a diehard doom eternal fanboy, I'm super excited to get into ultrakill because while i can tell its different from doom eternal in many ways, I still expect to really like it for many of the same reasons. Namely, the way you combo together attacks from multiple guns with melee attacks, the way you heal by getting in close and killing enemies, and the emphasis on fast movement with lots of verticality. I bought this game largely because of the frequent comparisons to doom eternal. 

 I plan to evaluate ultrakill on its own merits beacause it is def its own game doing its own thing in important ways, not some sort of low poly ripoff of DE. having a style meter and infinite ammo clearly illustrates that there are major differences in design philosophy between the two. But there's definitely a decent number of similarities, too, and I take all the comparisons of ultrakill to doom eternal I've heard as extremely high praise for Ultrakill, since DE is my favorite game of all time and I consider it a nearly flawless masterwork of game design. so when I continuously hear "ultrakill is awesome, its kinda like doom eternal", I'm interested.  

I'm glad it's significantly different from DE in many ways too, though. because if it was too similar to doom eternal, chances are it'd just feel like "doom eternal, but worse" to me. Even a pretty good "doom eternal, but worse" would be kinda disappointing since I could just play the real thing if that was the case.

fortunately this doesn't seem like "doom eternal-but-anything". It seems like a game that draws clear influences from doom eternal, quake, and devil may cry, that also has its own unique flair. Doom Eternal definitely has plenty of quake influence, as well as clear influence from character action games like DMC and bayonetta, too. despite not going so far in that direction as to include a style meter or anything like that. The whole design philosophy based around the "fun zone", "combat puzzles", "the earned power fantasy" and "holding the player accountable" differentiates DE from something like DMC or UK though, because DE kinda ***forces*** you to play in a highly mobile, stylish, fast, varied way where you chain together shots from different weapons and melee attacks in order to succeed on higher difficulties, and punishes failure to do so. On the other hand, character action games and from the looks of it, ultrakill, tend to encourage this type of stylish, skillful, frenetic, and expressive gameplay and mastery of mechanics ***for its own sake***, with the motivation not being overcoming the difficulty so much as the intrinsic fun of it, as well as constant feedback in real time from a style meter. I generally find the difficulty-driven "play cool or die" approach seen in doom eternal to be a more compelling motive for pursuing mastery, one which makes attaining mastery feel more rewarding than the looser, more sandboxy  "play cool because its cool and also there's a meter" seen in character action games, but there's definitely a place for both approaches and I'm not saying one is inherently ***better.*** At this point, after 1500 hrs, I also play doom eternal pretty much exclusively for the intrinsic fun of blasting through content in a skillful and stylish way much more than I do for the satisfaction of overcoming any challenge. despite eternal placing significant constraints on the player in a number of ways, I am so accustomed to its gameplay and mechanics that I feel I can play it in a very spontaneous and expressive way where I have plenty of freedom to make interesting choices within the bounds of the game's limitations. Definitely not anywhere near as much freedom as ultrakill seems to offer, but I can still screw around a bit, make risky maneuvers, use unconventional combos etc. and still blast through nightmare master levels. I often repeat arena fights/levels for the fun of trying to do it better, even though the challenge of just doing it successfully is gone. 

so ultrakills proposition of "master the combat and do cool, crazy shit just for the fun of doing so" is not a turnoff in the slightest. I totally get the appeal of mastery for its own sake, and I'd be surprised if I don't love this game. 

So like, what I'm saying is... I think the comparisons are warranted if not taken too far, but maybe some people dont recognize the differences enough.
Hmmmm... perhaps something like devil may shake? Devil may shudder? Shiver, perhaps?
    the devil shaker
        Come on man shake that skull
    Devil May shitter
I think this game is much more of a devil may cry and quake mix, it just makes me really mad that hakita never addressed this

Come on man shake that skull
That's right, i forgot
I read your comment to my favorite German streamer and we both ridiculed you for a while, just so you know
    How much money did you pay him to give a fuck?
I didn't think Divine Comedy was anything more than Bible Fanfic before delving into it. But after watching Wendigoon's videos on the whole series, it is definitely one of the coolest depictions of Hell. (and Heaven and purgatory tbh)

Some parts of Purgatorio and Paradisio genuinely made me tear up a bit. The parts where >!Virgil finally leaves Dante at the gates of Heaven, after which you realize that Virgil didn't need to walk through the cleansing fire with Dante, but only chose to so that he wouldn't have to do it alone. The part in Paradisio where Beatrice explains to Dante that God had been tending to the Garden of Eden since humanity had been expunged from it in the hopes that we would one day return.!<

I am by no means religious, but these two parts in particular made me tear up a bit.
    To be honest, it IS a Bible fanfic, but a really fucking good one, with a lot of stuff from Greek/Roman mythology. Despite being written 800 years ago, the punishments of hell are still impressive to this day, despite most of them being actually really simple. 

It has some heartwarming moments, but some are pretty fucked up. When getting into it for the first time, I was really curious what the final, and the worst punishment for the treachery layer will be, and I was expecting the worst.

But not this.
        Oh it definitely is Bible Fanfic, but like you said it is really good. It's just far more than a fanfic.
        Tbf the Bible is itself a fanfic of the Torah, which is a book written by ancient nomads.
And both systems stand heads above most shooters that use regenerating shields and stim packs.
basically
in doom u pick what weapon matches the best for ur opponent
in ultrakill u just pick whatever weapon u want and kill, also try to be stylish
