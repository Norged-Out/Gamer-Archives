[[Is sonic colours ultimate really that bad]]


I don’t get the hate, it’s basically the same game with barely any changes, that just means it’s as good as the original, maybe this is just my experience, but I completed the entire game on switch had encountered zero glitches, the worst I experienced was a little bit of slow down but that was only for a few seconds.


Not really, at it's core it's still Sonic Colors, even if it's buggy, it's still the game I know and love
The hate does seem a bit overblown. You are right, it's mostly the same with few changes. The problem however is that pretty much every change is either worthless, or actively detrimental to the game. So comparing it to the original, it is worse in a lot of people's eyes. And you know... A new version of a game shouldn't be worse than the original version.

And then there's the glitches, which btw, you did encounter. You may have not noticed them, but there are small graphical glitches everywhere.
    i havent found any glitches neither the graphical or in gameplay, maybe the xbox one version is all patched?
        The Xbox version is pretty much the most stable version from what I've experienced and heard. Some people say it's even more stable than the PC version.
I got it on Switch yesterday, and I've been enjoying it. I think most of the hate comes from the fact that not much changed, and what did change people don't seem to like. I personally like the new soundtrack. 30FPS on Switch doesn't bother me either, Sonic Colors isn't really a game that needs precise inputs, and it looks pretty smooth when playing on Switch. Yeah, it does have a few rough patches, like the load times, but overall I think this was a good rerelease.
You are correct. I had the same experience with it as you. All the hate comes from Sonic haters who jump at every chance to put Sonic down and from extreme fans that don’t like Colors and we’re upset that they were rereleasing that instead of whatever game they wanted.
    It’s like if a piece of sonic media is below being great it gets called awful, when really it’s pretty good.
I've stopped playing for a while after my save file got automatically deleted twice in a row.
Well I dislike the new version of the opening song compared to the original. That one slaps so much harder. And the Tails system is weird. Other than that, no complaints on my side tbh.
It had some pretty bad glitches at launch, but they've since been patched out.
The only problem I had was the hover wisp. It literally just didn't work. If you tired to dash through a line of rings and there was a turn it would just stop and not continue. Besides that it was pretty much the same as on the wii.
It’s bad because it doesn’t even look as good as the original. They never toned down the bloom and then went on to say the graphical glitches couldn’t be fixed due to the engine they’re using. It just made me mad that they basically said “you know those ugly ass bugs that everyone hates? Well you’re out of luck they’re staying.” It just came across as lazy and like they didn’t care. I genuinely want to play a good version of sonic colors, even if it’s just an hd port of the original. It’s just the fact that it has dumb graphical bugs that made me not want it
Yes, yes it is.
