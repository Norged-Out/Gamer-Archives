[[Why is Sonic Colors so hated now]]


It hasn’t escaped my notice just how hated Sonic Colors is now. I respect everyone’s opinions, but I remember when this game was praised left and right when it came out. Now it seems like fans have completely soured on the game like Heroes after a few years after it came out. Sonic Colors is still one of my favorite sonic games, so I’m curious why it’s so hated now.


From what I've seen with the most recent discourse about Sonic Colors is the following.
I think a lot of people did not like how many 2D segments were in Colors overall.
That's when Sonic Team started playing it a little way too safe in order to get high review scores and the least amount of complaints out of the fan base.
Not to mention I think it was the humor in the game.
The Meta Era introduced a lot of comedy, and as we know the lead writers had little to no knowledge about Sonic the Hedgehog at all and wrote him like a Saturday morning cartoon.
I think people enjoyed the comedy at first, but as we know as the Meta Era dragged on, many people don't look back on it very fondly as they used to.
    I think people criticize Colors with bad faith. It's not fair to hate a game because of what it "did" to the future of the franchise. 

If every game after Colors wasn't blatantly ripping it off, and doing everything Colors did but worse, I think Colors would be remembered with higher regard.

Because looking at Colors by itself, it's pretty fucking good. Even if you hate the writing, I think Sonic Colors was fresh at the time, especially coming off of Unleashed and Black Knight. I just wish that the story was a one-time thing, and wasn't what every future Sonic game strived to be.

It's not just the style of writing that future games took from Colors. Wisps, 2D levels in 3D games, World Maps instead of Hub Worlds, every game after Colors has these things, for better or for worse. Lost World and Forces even went to the extent of copying the final boss from Colors.

I'm thinking that Frontiers will be the end of the "Meta Era." On top of Ian Flynn writing the game, I am pretty sure Frontiers is not gonna have Wisps or 2D levels.

(Not that 2D levels are a bad thing, I just don't think Frontiers will have them.)
        I agree with everything you said.
I, too, hope that going forward, Sonic Frontiers' story will be a shining example of what we should expect from now on.
With Ian Flynn writing the story, I'm sure the story is going to be quite fantastic.
    Hasn't Sonic always been kinda a meta series? Like, the entire concept of Chaos Emeralds and going Super is a direct DBZ reference. The Death Egg and The Ark are obvious star wars references.
I think it's less that it's bad, and more that it removed a lot of what fans liked about the previous games, that people feel like it was a bit over-praised, and a lot of Lost World and Forces' problems are Colors' problems but worse.
It’s more Colors Ultimate than the original since it was released so buggy, but also Colors may be a good game but it’s story is painfully bad. You could argue Sonic games don’t need a good story, and that’s fair, but some people still prefer the more serious stories.
    I don't think it's mostly ultimate. Feelings were changing towards colours before that. A big reason I think is because the level design and how little 3D there is in a 3D sonic game
    About that, did they fix it? I've heard that there was an update that fixed most of the glitches
The best way I can describe it is that it's a good game, but only 10% a good SONIC game.

First levels of any given planet/section are usually great, but then the rest of it are... not very Sonic in how they operate. (And there's a fair amount of standing and waiting which is just completely antithetical to the boost format)
    My. Point. EXACTLY.
To be Honest, I never loved the game

But to be fair with it, it should've been one time event because it was loved for the new change of pace it brought despite me seeing it as huge downgrade (I'm a fan of 2000-2009)

but it made the same mistake of the dark age, it lasted too much

and too much of the same thing will eventually makes you hate it, and that leads us to what we are in right now
You're assuming these are the same people but the truth is they aren't. I'm someone that only recently played sonic colours so I'll give my take. 

Positives:

-Excellent theming
-Wisps are conceptually cool
-Final Boss
-Graphics

Negatives:

-Level design is a series downgrade from unleashed, I don't trust anyone that says that colours is a full game of the day stages from unleashed, stupid. Even if you like the game you have to admit that it isn't like unleashed boost levels.

-The games has a shocking amount of 2D which just stands out more since the level design isn't even close to most other 2D only games. Sonic also controls horribly in 2D.

-The bosses apart from final are lazy and boring to fight

-Story and Dialogue are pretty bad

-Each zone has far too many acts

-3D segments are few and far between and are usually very simplistic

-Some wisps are fun but others are gimicky and break the flow like cube

-Gimicky levels

Basically I think the reason colours gets more hate now is because when it came out many people just looked at it as a surface level 3D sonic games with no stupid other playable characters and werehog, but the actual level design and controls are pretty bad imo. That's not me saying people nowadays don't have legitimate reasons for liking the game but I think it was overhyped at launch due to meta aspects.
    >I don't trust anyone that says that colours is a full game of the day stages from unleashed, stupid.

I think that statement made a lot more sense back when Unleashed and Colors were the only two boost games
        Ehh, not really. The design philosophy is completely different and I don't think unleashed being the only example changes that. When someone says they want more daytime stages I would think they are saying they want more daytime stages not more stages with boost. I can only think that the people that said colours was a full game of daytime stages must have been people that played unleashed once, didn't like it then when colours came along just assumed that colours was a full game of it. I think more core sonic fans would see they are very different
Here's my take
I don't hate Colors
But I don't love it either
It has too many 2D section
A bad story my little sister could not stand she said"Why is Sonic now an idiot? He was badass in previous games even in 06 but Unleashed was the best"
Visually it looked stunning on the Wii
The game was just too easy... Even for a game which targeted an audience of kids
It's boring
If you asked me this old terrible video started it all:

Level design is plain bad.

The OST is awesome, art direction is one of if not the best in any Sonic game ever, but at the end of the day the level design just sucks.

I have a hard time comprehending how it was appreciated in the first place. Planet Wisp is good, and all other levels range from "Eh" to "Let me throw my controller at the screen".

There is definitely worse and it may be because this is very similar to 2D Mario which I don't like, but overall it feels like like half a worse 2D Mario, half an undescribed mess of level design all packaged extremely nicely.
