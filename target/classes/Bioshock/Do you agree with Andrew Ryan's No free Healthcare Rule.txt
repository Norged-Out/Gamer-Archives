[[Do you agree with Andrew Ryan's No free Healthcare Rule]]





Only if it gets us vita chambers and med stations that can fix every ailment for the price of Chinese takeout for two.
    The price for one and a half if they're hacked ;)
        And an added bonus of murder ;)
        Just own them smh
    Now i wanna see chinese takeout in Rapture
        there was a poster for that
            Had to google it and you’re right! I’ve been on an Asian food kick for a while and now I’m hungry for some lol.
Do y'all know that Andrew Ryan is not meant to be a role model right?
    neither are any of the “sigma male” figureheads, they’re deliberately portrayed as bad people, but that doesn’t stop weird manchildren from worshipping them.
        I disagree, Subject Sigma is a real hero.
            and a real human bean
        Imma have to google what a “sigma” is, im starting to notice that word being tossed around & im not in the loop of those things.
        You will not talk about Andrew Tate in that tone!
            Fuck Andrew Tate
                Geez, 29 downvotes. It was a joke lol. I hate that guy. But, I'm glad you guys hate him too.
                Reddit moment
    The game is literally about how Andrew Ryan's ideals created a shithole of a society
        Basically le communist worst nightmare
            I’d say the point was that it was *anyone’s* worst nightmare lol
            I don't think that's the own you think it is
    16 year old me didn't back in the day lol.
    I mean yes but like look at that smile
"Free Healthcare" isn't free.  It's a service you pay for via taxes.  I'd honestly prefer my taxes go to services that help people rather than funding military projects.
    Exactly. The wording around this stuff is purposely misleading.
    That's correct, but since some people like to use this argument ("its paid by taxes") to go *against* free healthcare, I should point out this: When you go to a hospital in a country w/ free healthcare, you don't have to provide any documents that prove you paid your taxes. Similarly, children or disabled people can also use its services. So yes, it IS free, and for everyone.

I live in Brazil, and in our healthcare system, even people from other countries who are just visiting can use any of our healthcare services without having to pay a single penny. I don't see those people paying our taxes.
        Idk about where you live, but in Australia (which has mildly public with private health care options) you need a Medicare card to get anything for free, which is basically proof you pay taxes. Foreigners can’t get Medicare cards
    Nothing is free, but it should be renamed cheaper healthcare because the taxes are a lot less than most drug healthcare costs
    Why not both? The two aren't mutually exclusive and you need both.
        I'm not opposed to both existing in a market, the same way that we have public schools and private schools, but public healthcare has to be a guaranteed right for everyone, and funded appropriately.  We have an issue of underfunding public education in the US, which is why it doesn't perform well in some communities.
    This actually makes a lot of sense. And plus with privatized Healthcare you get faster care
        Privatised means you have to pay extortionate prices
            Yeah but with internalized private Healthcare you have far less people receiving government Healthcare. Which means it's faster
                Wtf? This bullshit has been debunked over and over
                Wrong and Loud
                The average wait times in the US beg to differ
                    Try waiting times in the UK
                Tell that to every specialist I have to wait 5-6 months to see but still have to pay $500 with insurance for treatments.
                Tbh the UK has a mixed system, NHS providing public healthcare and private healthcare providers like Bupa or AXA etc. And we have one of the most shitty, underfunded healthcare systems in Europe. Miles better than the US, but still the shit one compared to other countries that have public healthcare. Fact is private companies can very easily sway policy, it's what happened with our rail service, our postal service and what corporate politicians like the entirety of the conservative party and the majority of labour end up doing to every public service. Private options for what should be public services open the door for corporate meddling until there's no good option left

American healthcare system has unparalleled responsiveness, with an emergency wait room time of merely 58 minutes as opposed to Britain's three hours…

Financially though, the US system is broken af.
                        This is a misreading of my point. I'm not claiming that the UK has better wait times than the US, I'm saying that it surpasses the IS in accessibility. Sure we have longer wait times, mostly for things that aren't life threatening triage is always necessary when there's a high enough volume of patients, the thing is it still far outpaces the US in one very important regard. The wait times in America may be shorter, but this only applies if you can afford to pay. It's inevitable that the US would have shorter wait times because all too often people can't afford to be treated in the first place. I should have made it clear that I was comparing the UK to the rest of Europe with regard to wait times and quality of care etc and not the us because America doesn't share the most basic requirement of medical care: that people are actually able to get it. Also even in the quality of care department I'd say the UK pulls ahead because there isn't the same prevalence of over prescription of opioids leading to a national crisis of addiction in the UK as in the US.

Tldr UK still vastly outpaces US in medical care because it's accessible and not the source of an opioid crisis.
                            Hummm. This seems to be a completely new point you are making now, so I’m not sure how it’s a misreading of your original point. 

Your original points were (1) that the UK has a mixed system, (2) the UK health system is shitty and underfunded (But “miles better than. The US”), (3) private companies sway policy, and (perhaps) destroy “every public service”. 

I appreciate your brand spanking new accessibility argument. 

I didn’t really make an argument. My point was to show a couple articles to rebut your original sub-point, that is, that the UK system is “miles better than the US system”.  With respect to accessibility, I agree with you. But there are many metrics in which the US system is far better than the UK system. I don’t really care either way.
                                Yeah I didn't specify how the UK has a better system than the US, I assumed it was clear that I could be talking about any number of things. It's not that it's a new point, I just wasn't being too specific about it. Sure the other metrics may exist, but they in no way make up for the glaring flaws with the American system, but again that's just something I wasn't specific enough on is all
                                    Agreed, though. The US system is shit. :-)
        This has not actually borne out in reality. Wait times in the US are comparable in peer nations with universal healthcare systems.
        You don't get faster care with privatized Healthcare.  You get faster care when you have easier access and less red tape.  There are many many studies confirming this, and showing that the US Healthcare system isn't faster, but it is way more expensive when compared to other countries.
        Why tf did this get downvoted to oblivion???? American-centric people have no idea that private health care is really good for people who can afford to pay for faster and better services, and public health care is a lot slower but still good.
            Because I'm wrong?
                It's literally not wrong.
    couldn't agree more
i dont agree with andrew ryan on anything lmao why would i agree with an egotistical hypocrite?
    He do be like that.
    Because someone’s personally has nothing to do with the validity of what that person says? 

An asshole can say something that’s a good idea. Or a kind person can say something that’s a bad idea. You shouldn’t use Andrew Ryan’s personality to judge his ideas.

Edit: I don’t see how this is a controversial statement. If someone is a misogynist and says communism is great, the fact that they’re a misogynist is irrelevant when assessing the merits of communism. This is literally the basis behind the ad hominem logical fallacy.
        uhhhh LMAO
        That's like saying you shouldn't judge the nazis because hitler was a dickhead lol
            Correct, you should judge the Nazi’s by the fact they literally genocided millions of people. Not because their leader was an asshole.
                But that goes against what you just said
                    No, it doesn’t. I said the personality traits of someone doesn’t matter when assessing that person’s ideas. What made the Nazi’s bad is that they wanted to exterminate an entire race of people. Not that their leader was an asshole.
                        But the entire beginning and main reason for the nazi's to start doing what they did is because hitler was a asshole who hated jews,  and he manipulated the people into starting this entire hatred because of the poor conditions Germany was left in after ww1 from the treaty of Versailles
                            So if someone were to ask you why Nazism is bad you think “because Hitler was mean” would be a stronger argument than “because they believed in murdering millions of innocent people”?
                                It doesn't matter about stronger arguments, it matters because the nazis believed in murdering millions of innocents and that hitler was a dickhead who started it all because he was butthurt. Anyways why are you arguing history on a bioshock subreddit? No one cares.
                                    You’re literally the one who brought it up. 

And I’m debating this because summarizing Rapture’s demise as “well Andrew Ryan was an asshole” is doing an extreme disservice to Ken Levine and the immense effort put into the game around historical and political commentary. The ideas of this game go way deeper than that.
                                    Because like fucking 200 of you dipshits completely missed this random person's point, and I just accidentally stumbled in this thread. 

I don't even really play Bioshock. I played the first one like 10 years ago, it was cool but this little thread managed to piss me off. It’s just so dumb to witness. This is a microcosm of the apparent dumbing down of society in favor of tumorous circle jerks of people desperate for validation.
                            Alright.

Hitler hated animal abuse. Is abusing animals good?
                                >	Alright.

>	Hitler hated animal abuse. Is abusing animals good?

Of course not. Hitler had a few positive philosophies, such as his stance on animal cruelty and vegetarianism. Hitler *also* had far more negative philosophies. His ridiculous, almost comically evil philosophies, ideals, and actions drown out the little positive about him. 

Hitler being anti-animal cruelty doesn’t magically make animal cruelty good and doesn’t magically make Hitler good.
                                    **Which was exactly the dude's point.**

Why did you all gang up on him like he was an asshole who was wrong? This literally was his point.

If I stay on Reddit too long, I swear I'm gonna get a fucking hemmorhage.
                But...that....that's their point
        You're right, I judge Ayn Rand...I mean Andrew Ryan's ideas on the fact that they kill people and enrich utter fucking sociopaths. Rapture was doomed to fail the moment a man like Ryan thought of it.
            How do Ayn Rand's ideas kill people and enrich sociopaths?
                Actively forsaking altruism, the idea that people are useless parasites unless they're profitable in all things, the very idea that men like Ryan are in any way self-made, a lack of any commitment to the common good or society, scorn for any form of regulation, seeing social safety nets as a bad thing, and I could go on and on. 

Rand refined the capitalist/libertarian ethos into a modern idealogy that espouses profit and selfish objectivism over compassion and base humanity. Which empowers sociopaths who believe in the myth of infinite growth and treat people like numbers to wreak havoc on the world and stack the deck in their favor against the people who make them their money. Hell, Rapture is a direct reference to Galt's Gulch, the wonderland Rand envisioned in Atlas Shrugged where all the rich ass hats go after literally nuking the means of production so the "parasitic" poor can't benefit from their absence.
                    What a gish-gallop of an argument. 

>Actively forsaking altruism

My guess is you're using this term in a different way than Rand does. I'm guessing you mean it to be simple charity. Rand means it as complete self-sacrifice to the needs of others.

> idea that people are useless parasites unless they're profitable in all things

Where does Rand say this?

>the very idea that men like Ryan are in any way self-made

How aren't they?

>a lack of any commitment to the common good or society

What's a common good?

I'd venture if I asked a Christian what the common good is they'd say for everyone to be a Christian and serve their fellow Christians. I'd venture a guess that you would not consider this to be "common good". I'd further venture the Christian would disagree with what you consider "the common good".

>scorn for any form of regulation

The free market actively provides regulation without government intervention.

>seeing social safety nets as a bad thing

Social safety nets aren't a bad thing. It's government involvement in them and compulsion to pay into them that are the bad things in objectivism.

>and I could go on and on

Bring it on.

>Rand refined the capitalist/libertarian ethos into a modern idealogy that espouses profit and selfish objectivism over compassion and base humanity.

Profit, you mean what's gained by both members to a voluntary transaction?

"Selfish", there's nothing wrong with rational self-interest.

Compassion, again, what's compassion and how is Rand against it?

Base humanity, ah yes, truly serving humanity is holding a gun to someone's head and making them pay for things for others.

>who believe in the myth of infinite growth

Define the myth of infinite growth and describe how it's a myth.

>treat people like numbers

How does Rand's philosophy lead people to treat others like numbers?

>wreak havoc on the world

How does Rand's philosophy lead people to wreak havoc on the world?

> stack the deck in their favor against the people who make them their money

How does Rand's philosophy lead people to stack the deck in their favor against the people who make them their money?

>Rand envisioned in Atlas Shrugged where all the rich ass hats go after literally nuking the means of production so the "parasitic" poor can't benefit from their absence.

Why is anyone entitled to the innovation, mind, or labor of another?
                        1. Rand means it in the sense of any societal safety net or sacrificing self-interest in the slightest. Her "heroes" are all self-serving ass hats who embody the myth of the self-made man ignoring that their workers and society as a whole enabled made the making of that money. In addition, she seems to ascribe to the “Great Man” theory of history which is just flat-out wrong.

2. Have you read Atlas Shrugged? It’s full of her macho business Daddies going on and on about how there are two types of people in the world, comparing most people to parasites. Not to mention the whole train tunnel sequence where she gleefully recounts thousands of people dying or the terrorist working for Galt that blows up the means of production so the “parasite” workers can’t seize them.

3. I’m glad you asked, men like Ryan, and their modern-day counterparts, are built by investments made into society itself, public infrastructure which they exploit, and being utter sociopaths to accumulate power and wealth. Ryan only got to where he was because of a lack of regulation, luck, and a cutthroat attitude that allowed him to become a modern-day robber baron literally burning down forests to stop them from being nationalized. 

4. I don’t know, clean drinking water and food, public roads and highways to allow freedom of movement for both economic and personal reasons, robust public programs that help people improve themselves and their situation instead of letting poverty consume them while the well to do live off their labor. Public health via regulation on pollutants/food safety/health care, and personal protections for marginalized groups and labor rights. All the things men like Ryan hate because it’s harder to control your workers when they have their basic needs met.

5.  The fuck it does. Insulin, a vital drug that’s so easy to make it was patented for $2, is hundreds of times more expensive in the US because the Pharma companies can charge it. Rivers were literally lighting on fire before regulation forced the companies dumping chemicals to stop. Company stores, industrial rape in mining communities, and child laborers were all major common issues across the US before the labor movement fought for and won protections under the law. The Free Market regulates itself about as much as a child with a plate of cookies does, they will always do all they can to make as much money as possible, no matter the personal or environmental cost. Hell, look out your window at the looming climate crisis, oil companies knew all about Climate Change going as far back as the fifties, but goose-stepped their way into it anyway, all for profit. If you honestly believe the free market regulates itself, you’re incredibly naive.

6. States (in the national sense), municipalities, and communities are the only entities capable of running a social safety net, and taxpayers paying into those social safety nets are always a net gain if they’re robust enough to actually improve people’s lives. Relying on a private option or charity does not work, under Reagan, he used the myth of the welfare queen to cut social program spending which led to an almost unprecedented increase in food insecurity while his complete stonewalling of aid for the AIDS crisis killed thousands of people. When the richest, most powerful government on earth focuses more on toppling democratically elected governments in South America, pouring billions into defense contractors' coffers, and the myth of trickle-down economics people die. The New Deal, while being capitalism’s last saving grace before an inevitable worker’s revolt, saved this country and millions of people were uplifted out of poverty because of it. Excuse me if I don’t trust the robber barons who want to go back to a time before it.

7. “Rational self-interest” has always been code for “I don’t think everyone deserves their basic needs met because I like the power it gives me”. And in the world Rand espouses, and Rapture demonstrates it’s not so much voluntary when one or two assholes can take over an entire industry/niche and then price gouge the fuck out of everyone. Profit is a drug that’s going to kill us all, a desire for profit led a fucking fruit company to use the CIA to coup a democratically elected leader because he wanted his country to control their fruit orchards, and profit led to Oil companies knowingly walking us into a climate disaster that could end all life as we know it, profit led to a mother deciding how long she can starve herself so her child can get the medicine they need to live. Living in a truly functioning and just society means investing in that society, taxes are part of that considering you use roads, sewers, and all the numerous programs that make your life as safe as can be (I.E the fire department, the FDA keeping you from eating poison or fake food, and the EPA keeping your water safe to drink ETC.) That’s compassion, paying into the system so that you and your fellow man can live in a society where they won’t be written off because they fell through the cracks, Rand is a hypocrite (died on government assistance gladly) and the mother of the worst aspect of Capitalist thought.

8. Look at the stock market, look at every company that demands growth year over year while still making insane amounts of profit. Taking and taking while all the while reducing what they’re actually offering and doing all they can to escape liability for their mistakes. Look at the Sacklers who fed the opioid crisis to grow their business exponentially year after year or the price of life-saving drugs (mostly paid for by federal taxpayer money) just to make even more insane profit, look at oil companies who killed every step towards a cleaner future and are fixing/overcharging for their products to make record profits while the world slips into climate coma. Capitalism demands infinite growth to please shareholders who have no idea what the real world is, and in that infinite growth myth, it aspires to its highest form. A cancer cell strangling the rest of humanity.

9. When all of your concern is your own self-interest, profits, and a disregard for safety or regulation of any kind the people actually generating that wealth become just another number. Look at how labor in this country treated people, especially women and children, in the gilded age and company town era. Children often worked in factories losing fingers and limbs on an industrial scale, and in the hay day of the company town, industrial-scale rape was practically institutionalized so sick or wounded men wouldn’t be thrown out on the street. This naturally leads to the red lining and Robert Moses’ active destruction of any chance for walkable cities in America and the advent of sealing off entire communities to die because they were poor and or POC. 

10. Lack of regulation (Climate change, mass exploitation of marginalized groups, health crises like the ones that saw the formation of the FDA) leads to death, sickness, and exploitation on a societal scale. Not to mention that Rand’s objectivism philosophy lends itself well to colonialism and imperialism just with a capitalist “Great man” theory bent.

11. See 10. because unregulated capitalists will do all they can to give themselves more power and money while stripping any chance of mobility from the workforce that makes them their money. Otherwise known as the “fuck you got mine” attitude that people like Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and every “self-made” man espouses.

12. Because they didn’t build it, workers did. Engineers, researchers, laborers, and everyone else who had a hand in the creation, innovation, and growth of the organization. If Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk alone could make a billion dollars without the thousands of people minimum it took to make it, then by all means do it, but in reality, they aren’t the gods amongst men that Rand paints men like them as. They’re just good at exploiting people, our toxic capitalist system, and making the cold calls that accrue the money they didn’t earn. Ryan didn’t build Rapture, Musk didn’t create Space X’s rockets or even found Tesla, and Bezos got extremely lucky and had nearly half a million dollars from his folks to create Amazon. If they alone had twenty dollars and a can-do attitude they’d die in the gutter like the rest of us. 

TL;DR: You missed the point of Bioshock because it touches on every fucking point I did. If you want to read about Rand's business daddies and fucking fountain heads, then by all means do, just don't base your world view on it.
        While I do agree with your point, this is kind of a strange forum to bring it up in.  However, I also think the response you got is disproportionately negative for no real reason, not sure what that's about.
            It’s classic group think. Whenever people see a downvoted post they want to downvote it themselves to feel like they’re part of the in group, without really thinking much about wrong or right. 

If you scroll down I’m literally being downvoted for saying the Nazi’s were bad because of genocide. People don’t think about it, they just want to be part of the group. 

Quite ironic when you think about it lol.
                >	If you scroll down I’m literally being downvoted for saying the Nazi’s were bad because of genocide.


Yeah…that’s not why you’re being downvoted.
                    Honestly, why then?  He was being a bit...strong headed, but that seemed to be the main point he was making.
                        >	Honestly, why then?  He was being a bit…strong headed, but that seemed to be the main point he was making.

Because he is completely ignoring that Andrew Ryan had a shitty personality in addition to shitty philosophy, and shitty actions.

Edit: plus the whole defending Hitler bit.
                            Well, I think you're missing their point.  He's not saying that Andrew Ryan has a good personality, or ignoring that it's bad...he's saying that it's not a good reason *on its own* to dislike his politics.   It's basically an ad hominem argument.

Andrew Ryan could have a great personality and we would still disagree with their politics.  A hypothetical person may be a complete asshole, but I might still like their politics (see the current "lesser of two evils" state of US politics).

The question is just...why do we need to talk about his personality at all when discussing their politics?

Also, where did he defend Hitler...?

I firmly believe Ryan’s personality fueled his actions, and it bears discussion. His stubbornness, his pride, his lack of empathy, and his greed all fed into his decision to build Rapture, his choice of government style, and his ineptitude in dealing with Fontaine. 

No, someone’s personality doesn’t always merit a discussion. Sometimes it even detracts from the discussion. That is not the case when it comes to Andrew Ryan. 

>	Also, where did he defend Hitler…?

Alright, I’ll admit I misinterpreted one their comments.
                                    Ah, now I understand you. Yes, I would agree with all of your points then :) Sorry to drag this on for so long, but thanks for humoring me.
        You’re making it seem like Andrew Ryan is an actual sentient being and not pixels.
        I dont agree with ryans ideas, but even then why is this post being disliked? Ideas are ideas no matter who came up with them
        >	An asshole can say something that’s a good idea. Or a kind person can say something that’s a bad idea. You shouldn’t use Andrew Ryan’s personality to judge his ideas.


You should judge people based on their personality traits *and* their actions. In addition to being an egotistical asshole  Andrew Ryan did not have a single redeeming action in the entirety of the Bioshock franchise. From the word “go,” his actions and ideology were remarkably bad.
        Okay dude I get what you’re going for but prob not the best example to die on the hill for 💀
            I’m never going to apologize and delete a post that’s objectively correct.
        The absolute refusal of most of those replying to you to even engage with the ideas is sad.
        i would recommend watching young sheldon on cbs
I don't agree with Andrew Ryan on basically anything.
    I like the whole "No Gods, No Kings, Only Man" bit. Sounds kinda Anarchistic. Everything else, No
        Yeah I like that bit but he doesn't really execute that vision
        Well the idea as it is written isn't terrible. It's just that right above it is a giant venerating bronze bust of his own head sneering down at the humbled observer. Rather defeats the whole slogan.
        Because it's propaganda?
This guy built an entire city based on his own very personal ideals.

Rapture was a literal social and political fly-trap, bring all these ideologists and entrepreneurs here and see what they do given a incredibly loose and unregulated system.

Honestly, the fact he has his genetic family able to heal for free while the rest cannot should speak volumes about Rapture policy / corruption.
        I mean, that's literally the anarchist moto, but he added men. Which in and of itself breaks the whole ordeal și c e it just replaces the oppressive role of a god and a king and gives it to men. Which isn't what anarchism is about
        Yeah but right wing libertarians have been appropriating the language of anarchists from the start, even going so far as to call themselves anarcho capitalists. It's just buzzwords coming from him
        agreed!! andrew ryan had the right idea but went about it the complete wrong way. like completely the wrong way lol
        Very accurate. With respect of property rights or contracts (at least initially at its start), very Anacap.
        Ryan had one good idea.
r/batmanarkham is leaking into the rest of reddit
I already live in America
Y’all, this isn’t a serious post. It’s an Arkham sub shit post that’s been spreading. Relax.
    At this point it's evolved into much more it's an actual good discussion
I need the Arkham subreddit to finally come up with a "shut the fuck up about your stupid shit and stop "invading" other subreddits" rule
    You totally roasted them
    Their “do you agree with?” posts are as funny as getting diagnosed with cancer. So fucking sick of them. I left that subreddit to get away from their dumbass jokes, but here we are.
    r/okaybuddyarkham
Seemed to work out ok for him and Rapture, right?
    I think rapture is going pretty well
I think I disagree with Ryan on just about every single issue lol
    He's honestly way too capitalistic for my liking
        Agreed. I'm very much on the side of marx in this debate 😅
            I mean Marx isn't that wrong.....
                Did you play the second Bioshock?
                    Lamb is more a collectivist cult than analogous to communism in the text. She espouses something closer to a religious commune than the economic system of communism as she's still at the top of a hierarchy while the people don't really control anything. Ryan represents Randian objectivism and capitalism, but Lamb doesn't represent Communism, just a radical collectivism that sacrifices the individual.
                        That’s what communism is, though. The root word of communism is “commune” which refers to a collectivist society
                            because root words = definition
                                Yes. Words mean what they mean. That’s why root words exist. That’s how you know “hydrotherapy” means “water therapy” or how you know “Annual” is derived from the Latin Anno meaning year or how Dominion and Dominance both come from the Latin Dominus meaning Lord
                                    “Words mean what they mean”

Yeah, and what they mean is not tied to the letters that form them. This is such a strange argument to make considering there are hundreds of words whose meanings differ than their roots. Especially for a word like communism which comes from a word meaning “for the community” and not “a collectivist society” or whatever you just pulled out of thin air.

Edit: literally in your own example, you say two words that come from “the lord” and yet have nothing to do with it now. You don’t seem to grasp how language works.
                        "a radical collectivism that sacrifices the individual" Yeah communism
                            Marxism is deliberately anarchistic and rejects both hierarchy and statism. Lamb, by definition, is not a Marxist. Maybe, *maybe* a commentary on Stalinism's authoritarian collectivism and cult of personality, but certainly not in any way a valid critique of actual Marxism.

                    Marx actually contributed alot to the devolpment and reform to human rights. Much like the early soviet union

                            You do realise that’s how education works, right? No one is born knowing information
                            I'm literally taking a class on the soviet union, and WWI

The soviet union devolped large amounts of Human rights under the rule of Bolchevic. It was the first time women had complete equality. It wasn't until he died and Stalin came in power that the soviet union became a mess.
                                Wonder how many women scholars would agree that women had complete equality in soviet russia.
                                    They did specify "before Stalin" which is fair enough.  During Stalin's rule and ever since after, Russia has been a human rights nightmare I don't think anyone would deny that.
                                    Original values were that people were people.
                                yeah , and that's exactly the point. communism became a mess because it doesn't work. people will always mess it.
                                    Communism under an authoritarian government will never work because it’s an oppressive system. We’ve yet to see an example of democratic communism
Health stations pretty much filled that gap with the ability to quickly heal from any wound for around $16 ($129.40 in today's buying power), why waste time going to a doctor for 10X the price and a long healing process? Med kits go for around $20 ($161.95 today) and would be an incredibly helpful thing to have around, it would have revolutionized healthcare for such a low price as to have put doctors out of business aside from specialists and top surgeons. Your average GP would be screwed with health stations in very convenient locations, I know they contain ADAM but it's never stated anywhere that using a health station would lead to runaway addiction the way plasmids and gene tonics do.
    Is that actually the inflation rate for it? That's like more than I make 2 weeks
        I miscalculated and used 1969 instead of 1960. Here are the prices adjusting for inflation in USD assuming that's the standard Rapture goes by. Source [here](https://www.in2013dollars.com/)

$16 would be $160.44

$20 would be $200.55  


Edit: At a wage of $15 for a 7.5 hour day you'd make $112.5 gross pay
            Damn thats like half my income. Like Actually lol.
                Here in Canada that's minimum wage, even counting for inflation that price for a medkit or health station is substantially lower than American healthcare and treatment would be practically instantaneous as opposed to taking time off of work and losing money in the process.
    Your $20 comes from the prices in the Circus of Values ?  

Consider thats the premium prices from a shortage run society situation. (and a vending machine).

Wouldnt it be likely to be cheaper when bought in a shop before the Chaos in Rapture began ?  Competition based  pricing ?

Perhaps half  or even a quarter as much ?

.
        Consider the fact that manufacturers of medkits could charge whatever they want if it's lucrative, and for a full restoration of even near fatal injuries within seconds that price is still insanely low compared to a doctor. IRL something like that would fetch thousands of dollars a shot, if you're working a low paying job that's dangerous you can't afford a doctor OR missing days or weeks of work while recovering so one of these could mean the difference between getting back to work or losing your home and job. The point of  the matter is that medkits and health stations even when adjusted for inflation would still be incredibly cheap, I'll look up what stitches and a broken arm will cost in America without health insurance.  


For patients without health insurance, stitches typically cost $200-$3,000 or more, depending on the provider, the injury and the complexity of the repair.  


Without health insurance, surgical treatment of a broken arm typically costs $16,000 or more.

As I've said even if the medkit cost 4X the amount ($802.20 adjusted for inflation in USD) it would still be incredibly cheap compared to your average medical bill. If I was making $15 an hour it would take about a week to pay off a medkit instead of months or years of my income. At its regular price that would take 13.37 hours of work to pay for a medkit, I still don't see the point you're trying to make here.
            > medkits could charge whatever they want if it's lucrative

consider 2 companies competing in Rapture

now the 'price' is relative to actual expenses with a sufficient profit

they never said its a monopoly (to the contrary actually)
                It could cost $2-$5 to make one, still a good profit for only $20. You sound like you just want to argue even though I've provided sufficient data to back up my opinion.
                    Have you missed what I said about competition ?

DO you understand what happens to prices when companies compete for customers?

And as I said before  : this is a vending machine price (middleman + overhead  involved) .   A shop price in NORMAL Rapture could easily be half your $20.

Post Chaos Rapture when money is nearly worthless and being found on the ground - it doesnt even make sense that all the machines are NOT EMPTY (if Raptures in as bad a state as the writers want to make the situation ). 

.
                        I'm referring to medkits in competition with doctors and normal medical treatment, I made it abundantly clear that I was in each response. If you're still not seeing the point I can't help you any further.
                            yes and if the kits work very well the doctors dont have much to do and likely move on to do things the kits cant do

more complicated operations.therapies would likely still require manual applications (including ADAM)

we are talking about costs of medi-kits not doctor treatments

$20 in a vending machine ...

you think a shop in NORMAL Rapture has it for the same price ?

if you can easily buy it in a shop then you dont in a machine 

machines aspect is being convenient which in our world people are willing to pay the premium price for (or the machines wouldnt exist)
                                A quote from the first thing I said here.

"...it would have revolutionized healthcare for such a low price as to have put doctors out of business aside from specialists and top surgeons. Your average GP would be screwed with health stations in very convenient locations..."

You're literally repeating what I said earlier while making baseless speculations on prices, and to my knowledge there was only one company making medkits to begin with. I feel like you're intentionally trying to argue at this point so I won't bother responding to you anymore, you're going in circles at this point.
                                    >	You’re literally repeating what I said earlier while making baseless speculations on prices, and to my knowledge there was only one company making medkits to begin with.

Yep. That’s u/premer777 for you. They look at Rapture and say “hey, this is a good idea. That Andrew Ryan is a pretty swell fellow.” 

Welcome to the wonderful world of Ryan fanboys.
                                    except Im trying to get thru to you that your $20 price out of a machine may : during a chaos world dystopia  ISNT THE SAME as when its in  NORMAL Rapture and when sold in shops (and with likely multiple manufacturers) .

you seem to be the one going off on tangents irrelevant to that point
No

It has now devolved into invading subreddits to post the same shitty fucking joke.
It probably wouldn't be very good Healthcare but I have to admit it'd still probably be more affordable than modern American healthcare

Edit: Spleens*R*Us!!! ^brought ^to ^you ^by ^Ryan ^Industries
    At least it won't put me in debt for simply living
        Yeah it's a pretty low bar tbh
            Much like my taste in women
        >	At least it won’t put me in debt for simply living

No. It would deny you service, and then you die. At least the US medical system doesn’t do that if you’re too poor to pay. 

Do you ever wonder if there were homeless in Rapture? Do you ever wonder if Rapture citizens had to pay for air? It’s an enclosed bubble, after all, in an ecosystem hostile to human life. Air is a service that must be produced, and therefore most likely paid for. What happens to someone if they can’t pay?
I don't think it particularly matters if I agree or not. Ryan runs/ran Rapture as he sees fit. If free healthcare was somehow profitable or led to more profit overall, then he would be all for it. But as it stands, it isn't/wasn't in his mind and here we are.
    Yeah I completely understand. For Ryan it was all about money.
I absolutely love him as a fictional character. I'd hate him if he was a real person
Lol ofc not, he's an idiot who couldn't admit that the ideals he espoused so piously were fundamentally flawed. Not when he had to defy them to keep rapture going at all (and even then it wasn't enough, the damage was already done) and not when those same ideals got him killed.
There's no such thing as free anything technically.

However I support tax-funded health insurance as a concept. People dying from preventable illness due solely to prohibitive costs is a crime in developed nations, in my opinion.
Why would I
    Idk makes money
        Rapture is a perfect example of why the blind pursuit of capital is a bad a idea.
This is a "Walt Disney" who established himself on murder and public dissent. No, I don't think I agree with his ideas on healthcare (which is the tamest subject he backs btw)
    Honestly Ryan backs alot of policies
As a person that lived in Germany now living in the US, NO! I do not agree.
He's a manifestation of the end game in an objectivist society.

The control and abuse that they purport to reject is just recreated over and over.  They don't want others to restrain their choices, but when they're on top, it doesn't count.

Ryan is a hardline take on it.  It's really difficult for me to see him as anything other as a bully with a veneer of civility and idealism... but his finger is always on the trigger.

So no.  Hard to agree with a guy who would tell you to buy a copy of "The Fountainhead" if you asked him why you can't see a doctor.
No, not at all. As someone wise once said: "Absolutely nothing should be sold for profit if its absence could kill you. Any modern system where people still die from lack of these resources should be dismantled."

And I'm pretty sure Ryan is very obviously portrayed as a bad guy.
Bioshock made me a leftist so no
    FOR REAL
If there's free health care, who's paying the medical staff? They wouldn't work for free.

Free healthcare wouldn't work in a place like rapture, unless Andrew Ryan implemented taxes.
    Well, Rapture kinda didn't work in general.
        It was doomed from the start as it's inspiration Galt's Gulch was.
        It’s a game, not a real life scenario. All of the ideas are hypothetical there, just like in Infinite, as we didn’t try anything near those systems.
    or nobody pays for it and they just make some doctors slaves
    Unless they remove money as a whole and then BAM Ryan creates communism
    Or make the rich pay the taxes. Done
        Or make the rich pay
Angry in french
    Okay but french is based
absolutely not.
Oh god they've found us
    Uwu
No I do not because if it wasn't for free healthcare I would have had no health care growing up
Not at all. Healthcare should always be free
The whole objectivist ideology is self-defeating. It claims a man has two rights, the right to his life, and freedom from coercion.

The former fails with the rest of the ideology because what does that make one entitled to? What does a man need to sustain his life? Food, water, a roof over his head, **necessary medical care.** Denying a man any of these things goes against the two primary tenants of your entire philosophy.

Secondly, the latter states freedom from coercion. In a system of an entirely free market where it is absolutely necessary to work for an income in order to sustain your primary needs, do you have the choice not to engage in it? You are coerced into making countless daily decisions that you have no real control over because the inherent system prevents you to have actual freedom.

The whole game is in a way is a sequel to Atlas Shrugged that shows what happens to Ayn Rand's little "utopia" the moment it meets reality.
    This is the right idea. You really don't have freedom in a heavily capitalistic society
        Exactly the gripe me and a lot of other people have. You don't think about it much but there are a ton of aspects of our lives we straight-up don't get to have a choice in because we are fundamentally forced to engage in the system.
            Yeah I mean capitalism is based off exploitation so it makes sense
                Precisely. A pity saying so is oft considered getting too political.

(Even though being political is the whole point of Bioshock, but I'd digress.)
                    If we can't talk about politics in a political Game what's the point
    youve taken the 'sweat of the brow' literally ?

you seriously leave out the right to property ?  (remember the Forest thing ??)

go to r/objectivism to understand better what objectivism is.

.
Rapture Is, from a social, economical, and philosophical point of view, shit. 
Good thing we burn it.
    The view was nice tho
Andrew Ryan is my father and anything he says is automatically right.
    Respecting ones father is important
        It is. Andrew Ryan is actually a traditionalist at heart. That’s why he named Big Daddies Big Daddy.
Rapture is literally in shambles. Capitalism is the lesser evil compared to communism, but uncontrolled capitalism with no government regulation? Big nope.
    rapture had been subjected to terrorism by super-powered anarchists

we see it in the game AFTER its been thoroughly disrupted/half-destroyed  by that.
Nope and i wish the people who do end up losing their money and get hit with cancer, so they can know what that feels like
    Why are you booing this man, he's right?

(He's talking about executives of the pharmaceutical industry who leech off of people's need for life-saving medical care.)
    Privatized Healthcare should be a luxury but regular Healthcare should be accessible to the public
Obviously no.
I don't understand the utter folly of a populace living in a hermetically sealed environment without a minimum level of guaranteed healthcare as an insurance against citizens succumbing to disease or mania...
    If 1 disease broke out it would probably be a pandemic lmal
Ryan wants everyone to be able to work and reach the goal that they crave through their own sweat. He should know that the only way his ideal of meritocracy can be achieved is providing everyone with proper and adequate health and education opportunities. So no. He can eat shit.
    Damn a thrilling conclusion
Let us set aside my own beliefs and look at this from an Objectivist viewpoint. You have no restrictions until what you do impinges on others.

The problem is that when we are both sharing a big metal box underwater, if you catch something then I am likely to as well and our productivity is impacted. Even Andrew Ryan could be affected. 

You do not want to discourage people from getting treated. Accidents are something else though. Some people are employed but many are free agents. Should they be covered against work related injuries? I can't catch your broken arm, but I can catch your flu.

So at least a minimal health service where you contribute to a mandatory basic insurance.
Certainly, is not a man entitled to the sweat of his brow?

There's no such thing as free. Taxation is the process of stealing the hard work of others and redistributing it according to the whims of venal politicians. 

I do support charitable giving to assist those who temporarily cannot support themselves but it should always be voluntary.
Before Giga Chad, there was Andrew Ryan
    Ryan is big chad

To everyone taking this seriously, this is a shitpost
    Yes but also I'm curious about free Healthcare
    the thing about BioShock (Rapture) was it was a reflection of the way the world was pre-FDR/Wilson - a time when things ran without all the socialism and welfare state.

---

Objectivism has checks and balances in it and a different balancing point then the current society. 

Consider that doctors in rapture have to compete for patients and THAT lowers the price of healthcare

Now add  the current government overhead and inefficiency that eats a huge chunk of the taxpayer money spent on it (as well as NOW interfering with the care that doctors can give). 

.
        I think you responded to the wrong person

I'm a shitposter with meaning
Yes because honestly rapture kinda surpassed most medical needs....ever. listen there is a huge difference between health care ilr where diseases and treatment for anything require a lot of people time and devotion to keep a population healthy. 
Rapture literally surpasses DEATH!! In a society that has such advancement and such differences in how you can easily treat any number of illnesses, then no free health care isn't as much of an issue when it comes down purely to cash. Now the core issue of rapture is that it wants no regulation of business but not regulation of behavior either. Some crimes exist in rapture but bluntly ryan never accounted for terrible behavior as being counter productive to his city until Fontaines revolt. The problem is not availability of health care it's the lack of constraint on the culture around these institutions. Rapture very much didn't have a healthy atmosphere for any productive work. It was cramped, people lack sunlight, the only mental health professional was a psychotic cult leader (lamb had more in raptures down fall than ryan tbh), and no investment was made in a continual infrastructure to maintain the city. 

Basically ryan failed in that he had literally the greatest advancements in human history but the lack of ability to get past his own arrogance to see his creation itself could benefit, not even the people. Making a mechanical form of maintenence is not out the question when the thinker was created, instead of big daddies. He didn't think of how to automate the city enough to where it was continually maintenence so such social issues wouldn't pop up. Ryan believed everything was fair from competition, natural equality, but he never maintained a level playing field where that would make it the most productive. 

Now irl until we have such insane advances in Healthcare and tech, gonnahave to have a hard no. Some systems are in place for a reason and rapture is no great model when the creator lacked a lot of fundamental sense of how to keep a city running.
Edit:clarification with ryan I see him as saying no collective taxes for health care available equally, versus a laizze Faire idea of paying directly.
    > ryan never accounted for terrible behavior 

Things called laws and crimes - basic things to have in a society.

Under Objectivism, your rights end where your behavior  starts intruding on others rights - and those rights include your safety and possessions and privacy. 

They did not speak much of such things in the game (as they had to make Ryan into the bogeyman to get you to blindly follow a sociopath).   

We did  see splicers dressed as cops.

You cannot run a city (for over 10 years) operating under anarchy.   There had to be some system of justice existing.

The portrayal of Rapture was not supposed to be some fantasy, rather a reflection of society on the surface.

.
        Okay when yaron brook says the game isn't objectivist or correctly says her ideas idk why you're bringing ayn rand into this. Yes they based ryan off John galt but it hardly means you can drag in ayn rand to justify your point when the game misrepresents so many of her ideas. 
Also ayn rand would hardly every utter the phrase "petty mortality" so don't throw her into this. 
Even on top of that I meant he never accounted for a sociopathic grifter who was willing to do anything and everything for his own sake or any of the psychos of rapture. He was so laizze Faire he literally forgot basic ethics.
            you will have to spell out which of the ayn rand ideas you say the game misrepresents

Ive already said many times before that the writers had to create a dystopia and so conflictingly/contradictorally avoided significant elements of  objectivism/libertarianism  - like a (competing) free press what would have instantly denounced Fontaine as a seller of poison (the insanity and disfigurement/cancer), thus ending/nullifying his story role of becoming an industrial  mogul to rival Ryan.

He accounted for miscreants and had security to take care of that if not also an operational system of constables to handle such things.

And again (once informed) the sociopathic grifter would be quickly done away with in a society which is supposed to empower the citizens.  Rapture was a small place that he could not run from the reaction the population would have to his criminal behavior.

.
                Okay fair enough, firstly the issue is a large amount of half ideas. Essentially ayn rand had her philosophy as an integrated whole, meaning to agree with one is to agree with all of it and inturn rand herself. 
So firstly, one example I have already given you, ayn rand would not ever approve of a society that discounts morality and props up uninhibited behavior as much as ryan does. For instance in the rapture novel two grocery store owners are competing, but one owns essentially the market for the whole of the area garbage, charging his competitor double to drive his grocery store out of business. Ryan ignored this and basically said tough luck, instead of rand which would encourage the community not to indulge in such unethical behavior as to drive out competition through a corporatist tactic. 
Another is that rand would never support or allow any form of government nationalization or possession as ryan industries took fontaines company after the revolt. Rand would never consider that anything but unethical and completely against her ideas of laizze Faire, even with the revolution. Essentially she would clearly see it as wrong for any form of state to claim ownership of a company. 
Another is that there is room for ethics, rand would vomit at the idea of anything involving the violations of medical ethics or even the countless issues of the little sisters, considering she viewed such things as being antithetical to a moral society. 
I can go on but if you want to learn more Read ayn rand and the virtuous egoist. That book outlines a large idea of her beliefs but ultimately will tell you how differently she viewed the world from andrew ryan. It's a corruption of objectivist ideas to have all the epistemology and poltics, but none of the complete ethics.

Edit Apologies it seems I talked past you. Yes ideally that would be an idea in objectivism, however it would not be an idea that ryan would allow atleast as far as the characters actions would say. But I will say andrew ryan is not an objectivist by any stretch and moe the anarchocapitlist from hell,lol.
                    ayn rand is not the 'end all and be all' of Objectivism.

> that discounts morality and props up uninhibited behavior as much as ryan does. 


What does he prop up ?  And use examples of what was in original pre-kashmir rapture and not in the chaos rapture where society had already disintegrated  and Ryan is in emergency/war mode.

Consider that Fontaines crimes were done in secret -- indicating it was NOT freely allowed or accepted or 'uninhibited'.

The writers hardly allowed any action by the populace as they needed that easy dystopia story 

Also the author of the  'rapture novel' has  just ups the stuff in the game (again I assert its post chaos an dNOT normal Rapture)  as most takes place before the chaos begins and he needs all the action to spice up the book.

I've elsewhere explained where the Grocery store guy story is bosh because it ignores so ***MANY*** possible alternates the victim had to to the abusive neighbor short of shooting him. The common neighborhood mechanism were completely ignored (just pay a kid to haul your trash guy ...) The author had to simpleton-style prop up the 'dystopia'  (perhaps didn't want to contradict the games similar pattern of ignorance).  Seriously  Its like these people HADNT operated in the mean world of the surface before they got to rapture.  

The nationalized Fontaine Futuistsics is similar 'baaaad ryan'  smear.   The addicts needed ADAM, Fontaines assets would have been used for reparations to his victims and the 3 1/2 month period this happen (before the terrorist chaos began) didnt allow any story of what was to be done in a more complete plan.

So really its the writers who needing their 'easy' story for a slaughter-fest dystopia, ignored basics of objectivism/libertarianism and carelessly contrive a storyline with its 'hate ryan' mantra to cover for that midgame 'plot twist'  (and no Choice  to NOT follow the sociopath atlas - not giving their twist  away to the player) 

I can say this because the writers are inconsistent and have things so contradictory to what they say Rapture operated (and what the world in general operates through).

You’ve mentioned this idea of Ryan using Fontaine Futuristics as reparations. It was hilarious then and hilarious now. What evidence can you provide fron *any* of Andrew Ryan’s words or actions would ***ever*** give you the idea that he would use the assets for reparations? What evidence can you provide fron *any* of Andrew Ryan’s words or actions would ***ever*** even attempt to consider paying reparations? 

What evidence can you provide fron *any* of Andrew Ryan’s words or actions that indicated Ryan even had a plan to fix Adam? An inkling of an idea that he would try to fix Adam? 

>	contrive a storyline with its ‘hate ryan’ mantra to cover for that midgame ‘plot twist’  (and no Choice  to NOT follow the sociopath atlas - not giving their twist  away to the player)

Did you miss the part where it was Andrew Ryan demanding Jack kill him? Ryan was there. Ryan was in full control. Ryan could have ordered Jack away, could have conceivably ordered Jack to kill Atlas. Instead, he decided to pick up his toys and go home. Ryan decided to blow up his city, and order his son to brutally beat him to death, and even turned off his private vita chamber so Ryan wouldn’t be reborn. 

>	I can say this because the writers are inconsistent and have things so contradictory to what they say Rapture operated

You’ve claimed this before, but have never once been able to back it up. What was inconsistent about the writing of Bioshock? What was contradictory in the plot? I’m eagerly awaiting an example.
                            cant help you if you have no understanding about how things work.

your simpleton arguments are always 'it was never said in the game' 

and my reply is that the game if full of gaps and vagaries where much which HAD TO BE THERE  was never mentioned.

Insults without any kind of evidence. Classic u/premer777. 

>	and my reply is that the game if full of gaps and vagaries where much which HAD TO BE THERE  was never mentioned.

I pulled out specific things to address because you claim they’re in character. Show me the evidence. 

I’m still waiting for an example of a contradiction, fyi.

Rapture *did* have a competitive free press. There were multiple news papers, including Ryan’s own Rapture Tribune, in addition to a number of magazines and novels. 

There are no known headlines about Adam side effects. There is one about Adam shortages due to the war. 

You paint this hyper idealized version of the press and frankly capitalism as a whole, which is *not* grounded in reality. It’s certainly not grounded in the reality of the “Pre-FDR” US that you’ve insisted on multiple times. Things like bribery and intimidation of journalists were and continue to be a thing.

Edit. Meanwhile, we even have an example of a journalist who accepted bribes not to report on Adam: Stanely Poole.
                    

'Free Press' that misses the whole  INSANITY, DEFORMATION CANCERY STUFF with ADAM  - conveniently until Ryan is now able to be blamed for it is my simple argument --- with the Game Writers playing with the  story details to make them fit their BLAME RYAN plot.

So the Writers inconsistency about an ACTUALLY WORKING  Free Press is not really there for that one VERY IMPORTANT game explanation.

You might want to review what I was referencing about Pre-Wilson/FDR as to the less regulated capitalism in the US.  If you don't know what I am talking about, you have a huge gap in your understanding of US History.

Andrew Ryan *isn’t* blamed for the side effects. There *are* no newspaper headlines about Adam side effects, period. 

What Ryan *is* blamed for is his inaction towards Adam. 

>	So the Writers inconsistency about an ACTUALLY WORKING  Free Press is not really there for that one VERY IMPORTANT game explanation.

As a reminder, “free press” means free from government intervention and government censorship. It doesn’t mean “always perusing the truth in the name of the best interest of the people.” 

For example, the US has free press. The US’s press coverage of certain events can be extremely disappointing.

Interestingly enough, Andrew Ryan actually kills the free press in Rapture. He orders all publications to cease, and places a lock down on the PA system. 

>	You might want to review what I was referencing about Pre-Wilson/FDR as to the less regulated capitalism in the US.  If you don’t know what I am talking about, you have a huge gap in your understanding of US History.

It’s like you’ve never heard of price fixing, captive markets, company towns, monopolies, etc. Do you understand *why* the Progressive Era happened in the US? Hint: Unregulated capitalism which resulted in widespread abuses of workers and consumers. Oh, hey, and let’s not forget child labor in factories, and mines. 

People who ~~live in glass houses~~ don’t know what free press and price fixing are shouldn’t throw throw stones.

No, I’m a liberal
    I understand that
What?? No. Fuck no. What are you, a Republican?
    Oh no I would never touch that with a 10 foot pole
That’s one of the very few things in this world that should be free, human life is not something you can just put a price on.
Free healthcare means over crowding, meaning rushing doctors meaning worse health care but it’s free. Paying for it on the other hand means only those who can afford it get help. But it’s good health care solid treatment. It’s a hard choice to make
    There are pros and cons to each scenarios, there are no wrong answers here
        I agree, it’s such a tough situation
            Yeah discussions like this have no right answer
                You have sparked up a good discussion though!

    I think I ask an important question
Would be the same position on any welfare state "free" handouts.

Charities in Rapture were not prohibited (remember Fontaine's/suchongs clinics ?)

Insurance was not prohibited.

Lmao all these people getting ultra triggered over a joke post that invites conversation in a content starved subreddit. Imagine having nothing better to do but seethe over something so dumb
    2 things are upsetting people here.
1. The politics
2. The refrence to batman arkham
        I mean I can somewhat understand the politics, however the entire point is his politics resulted in a shitshow but at least it’s decent conversation. I’m more talking about the people losing their minds over the r/batmanarkham joke. I personally find the subreddit hilarious but usually the mature thing to do if you don’t like a post is downvote and move on with your life. There’s multiple comments here over people legitimately letting this post ruin their day and it’s hilarious to see
            Yeah and one that crossed Comments to be angry at me in another.
I agree on almost everything, the only time he started acting like a modern Government the whole city fell
    You missed the entire point of the game
    did u play the game?
    This is sarcastic, or? This has to be a joke.
    Your right when the rapture council stoped elections and used the rapture security like a military occupied force the whole fragile card pile collapsed. The only thing Ryan did wrong was to not adhere to the nonaggression principle and to run the city in a authoritarian fashion.
        Totalitarian is pogging
        they had elections ?

it was never described

most of the authoritarian things you saw was done after there was a 'civil war' with a bunch of splicer terrorists tearing up the city and endangering everyones survival
            The elections happened before the war and can be found mentions in the audio files of the game
        >	Your right when the rapture council stoped elections

There were no elections in Rapture. 

>	The only thing Ryan did wrong was […] to run the city in a authoritarian fashion.

Talk about burying the lede.
            A propaganda playlet in BioShock 2 Multiplayer mentions that the elections to choose new members for the city council were postponed several times in the months leading up to the Rapture Civil War. So yeah they did
                >	A propaganda playlet in BioShock 2 Multiplayer mentions that the elections to choose new members for the city council were postponed several times in the months leading up to the Rapture Civil War. So yeah they did

Interesting. I never played the multiplayer. 

Fascinating that the playlet is the only direct mention of elections.
                    I mean they only show glimpses of pre civil war the main game is set in a post civil war and in anarchy so its not the main focus. Also bill McDonagh mentions elections in an audio diary but is a blink and you miss it thing
                        >	I mean they only show glimpses of pre civil war the main game is set in a post civil war and in anarchy so its not the main focus.

Not really. The audio diaries make it abundantly clear all was not well in Zion prior to the Civil War.
I don’t agree with anything Ryan says except for his socially liberal views, especially for his time.
Andrew Ryan is a cock sucker and not in a good way.
Lemme think. NO
Agree
Watch this post get locked.
    It's definitely getting locked
No its dumb
The only thing I agree with Andrew Ryan on is that banner at the lighthouse before you take the bathesphere down to Rapture. “No Gods, No Kings, Only Man”.

Everything else? Fuuucccccckkkk that, that dude is a monster, a literal walking sack of shit.
Absolutely not, it’s a horrible rule as you can see in the US today
Of course not, because I would like people to receive treatment without having to worry about going into debt or being unable to pay for rent
Not at all, however if I were Andrew Ryan I understand why he wanted to pursue that
Healthcare can never be "free" if it was, then health practitioners would be slaves.

No good or service is ever truly free, it must be provided by someone like a healthcare provider or a mechanic or a store owner etc.

Free would mean we are entitled to the labor of another person and that, as I stated, is slavery.
No
No
“Is not a man entitled to the sweat of his brow” i’m gonna assume that means medical underneath that as well somewhere. More of a ya get what ya earn mentality. Kind of a double edge sword, when you come to think about it.
Not free but heavily subsidised is key. When it’s free and run by the government it tends to be very inefficient and leads to a lot more waste and unnecessarily long waiting lines. Small affordable pricing just makes it so that people that need it the most get it sooner.
No. Not in the current form no.
I can't tell if this is a shit post or not 😭
No not at all. Forcing people to buy health care just actively lowers quality off fire also increase the amount you have to spend on healthcare .
The only thing I agree with Andrew Ryan on is that I do think a man is entitled to the sweat of their brow. What I do nt agree with is his execution of it, because in Rapture that basically was: "If I own a company, I'm entitled to 100% of the money it makes, the workers should just be happy to have work, they aren't entitled to anything"
POV: you are an uncivilised American trying to find funding to fuel your future wars
Hmmm, I'm not sure if I can trust or agree the words of a man whose model society failed hard...
Nope. Socialised healthcare rocks.
Omfg I thought this was over…
really guys the bit's kinda feeling like how the joker does in the arkham games.
Off course not man. I love EVERY character from this story, don't care how controversial they may be because they are sooo well written. But if someone actually agrees with the majority of the politics and laws adopted in Rapture, well i'm gonna be very afraid of that person lmao.
As EU citizen, it's mind blowing for me that there is no free health care everywhere, it feels for me like one of basic privilege as citizen. And as free we ofc take into account that everyone pays for it from taxes, like there is no better way of spending taxes money than public health care. 

I understand that some ppl are used to not have this security, but living in fear that I or someone close to me could not afford that expensive treatment that save his or her life is straight up not normal, what's the point of living in set society if it gives shit about you.
Pleasantly surprised to see this many redditors didn’t totally miss the point of bioshock
No, wtf. People without money deserve healthcare too. In my third world country we have free healthcare, obviously it works bad because is third world country, but it could works fine. I think that the state owe everything to the people that they govern.
Yes
When I was 10 I got home cancer. If not for free healthcare my family would have lost our house.

The treatment for that has ever since ruined my body, and for the last twenty years I have been too sick for work.

If not for free healthcare I would be dead.

Yeah I'm pro it. And so should everyone else who believes there is value in a life.
The only main thing i dont agree with conservatives is no free healthcare, most of the things i do agree
There's a reason he died the way he did lol

            Reddit moment
The game is literally about how Andrew Ryan's ideals created a shithole of a society
    Basically le communist worst nightmare
        I’d say the point was that it was *anyone’s* worst nightmare lol
        I don't think that's the own you think it is
16 year old me didn't back in the day lol.
I mean yes but like look at that smile
Exactly. The wording around this stuff is purposely misleading.
That's correct, but since some people like to use this argument ("its paid by taxes") to go *against* free healthcare, I should point out this: When you go to a hospital in a country w/ free healthcare, you don't have to provide any documents that prove you paid your taxes. Similarly, children or disabled people can also use its services. So yes, it IS free, and for everyone.

I live in Brazil, and in our healthcare system, even people from other countries who are just visiting can use any of our healthcare services without having to pay a single penny. I don't see those people paying our taxes.
    Idk about where you live, but in Australia (which has mildly public with private health care options) you need a Medicare card to get anything for free, which is basically proof you pay taxes. Foreigners can’t get Medicare cards
Nothing is free, but it should be renamed cheaper healthcare because the taxes are a lot less than most drug healthcare costs
Why not both? The two aren't mutually exclusive and you need both.
    I'm not opposed to both existing in a market, the same way that we have public schools and private schools, but public healthcare has to be a guaranteed right for everyone, and funded appropriately.  We have an issue of underfunding public education in the US, which is why it doesn't perform well in some communities.
This actually makes a lot of sense. And plus with privatized Healthcare you get faster care
    Privatised means you have to pay extortionate prices
        Yeah but with internalized private Healthcare you have far less people receiving government Healthcare. Which means it's faster
            Wtf? This bullshit has been debunked over and over
            Wrong and Loud
            The average wait times in the US beg to differ
                Try waiting times in the UK
            Tell that to every specialist I have to wait 5-6 months to see but still have to pay $500 with insurance for treatments.
            Tbh the UK has a mixed system, NHS providing public healthcare and private healthcare providers like Bupa or AXA etc. And we have one of the most shitty, underfunded healthcare systems in Europe. Miles better than the US, but still the shit one compared to other countries that have public healthcare. Fact is private companies can very easily sway policy, it's what happened with our rail service, our postal service and what corporate politicians like the entirety of the conservative party and the majority of labour end up doing to every public service. Private options for what should be public services open the door for corporate meddling until there's no good option left

American healthcare system has unparalleled responsiveness, with an emergency wait room time of merely 58 minutes as opposed to Britain's three hours…

Financially though, the US system is broken af.
                    This is a misreading of my point. I'm not claiming that the UK has better wait times than the US, I'm saying that it surpasses the IS in accessibility. Sure we have longer wait times, mostly for things that aren't life threatening triage is always necessary when there's a high enough volume of patients, the thing is it still far outpaces the US in one very important regard. The wait times in America may be shorter, but this only applies if you can afford to pay. It's inevitable that the US would have shorter wait times because all too often people can't afford to be treated in the first place. I should have made it clear that I was comparing the UK to the rest of Europe with regard to wait times and quality of care etc and not the us because America doesn't share the most basic requirement of medical care: that people are actually able to get it. Also even in the quality of care department I'd say the UK pulls ahead because there isn't the same prevalence of over prescription of opioids leading to a national crisis of addiction in the UK as in the US.

Tldr UK still vastly outpaces US in medical care because it's accessible and not the source of an opioid crisis.
                        Hummm. This seems to be a completely new point you are making now, so I’m not sure how it’s a misreading of your original point. 

Your original points were (1) that the UK has a mixed system, (2) the UK health system is shitty and underfunded (But “miles better than. The US”), (3) private companies sway policy, and (perhaps) destroy “every public service”. 

I appreciate your brand spanking new accessibility argument. 

I didn’t really make an argument. My point was to show a couple articles to rebut your original sub-point, that is, that the UK system is “miles better than the US system”.  With respect to accessibility, I agree with you. But there are many metrics in which the US system is far better than the UK system. I don’t really care either way.
                            Yeah I didn't specify how the UK has a better system than the US, I assumed it was clear that I could be talking about any number of things. It's not that it's a new point, I just wasn't being too specific about it. Sure the other metrics may exist, but they in no way make up for the glaring flaws with the American system, but again that's just something I wasn't specific enough on is all
                                Agreed, though. The US system is shit. :-)
    This has not actually borne out in reality. Wait times in the US are comparable in peer nations with universal healthcare systems.
    You don't get faster care with privatized Healthcare.  You get faster care when you have easier access and less red tape.  There are many many studies confirming this, and showing that the US Healthcare system isn't faster, but it is way more expensive when compared to other countries.
    Why tf did this get downvoted to oblivion???? American-centric people have no idea that private health care is really good for people who can afford to pay for faster and better services, and public health care is a lot slower but still good.
        Because I'm wrong?
            It's literally not wrong.
couldn't agree more
He do be like that.
Because someone’s personally has nothing to do with the validity of what that person says? 

An asshole can say something that’s a good idea. Or a kind person can say something that’s a bad idea. You shouldn’t use Andrew Ryan’s personality to judge his ideas.

Edit: I don’t see how this is a controversial statement. If someone is a misogynist and says communism is great, the fact that they’re a misogynist is irrelevant when assessing the merits of communism. This is literally the basis behind the ad hominem logical fallacy.
    uhhhh LMAO
    That's like saying you shouldn't judge the nazis because hitler was a dickhead lol
        Correct, you should judge the Nazi’s by the fact they literally genocided millions of people. Not because their leader was an asshole.
            But that goes against what you just said
                No, it doesn’t. I said the personality traits of someone doesn’t matter when assessing that person’s ideas. What made the Nazi’s bad is that they wanted to exterminate an entire race of people. Not that their leader was an asshole.
                    But the entire beginning and main reason for the nazi's to start doing what they did is because hitler was a asshole who hated jews,  and he manipulated the people into starting this entire hatred because of the poor conditions Germany was left in after ww1 from the treaty of Versailles
                        So if someone were to ask you why Nazism is bad you think “because Hitler was mean” would be a stronger argument than “because they believed in murdering millions of innocent people”?
                            It doesn't matter about stronger arguments, it matters because the nazis believed in murdering millions of innocents and that hitler was a dickhead who started it all because he was butthurt. Anyways why are you arguing history on a bioshock subreddit? No one cares.
                                You’re literally the one who brought it up. 

And I’m debating this because summarizing Rapture’s demise as “well Andrew Ryan was an asshole” is doing an extreme disservice to Ken Levine and the immense effort put into the game around historical and political commentary. The ideas of this game go way deeper than that.
                                Because like fucking 200 of you dipshits completely missed this random person's point, and I just accidentally stumbled in this thread. 

I don't even really play Bioshock. I played the first one like 10 years ago, it was cool but this little thread managed to piss me off. It’s just so dumb to witness. This is a microcosm of the apparent dumbing down of society in favor of tumorous circle jerks of people desperate for validation.
                        Alright.

Hitler hated animal abuse. Is abusing animals good?
                            >	Alright.

>	Hitler hated animal abuse. Is abusing animals good?

Of course not. Hitler had a few positive philosophies, such as his stance on animal cruelty and vegetarianism. Hitler *also* had far more negative philosophies. His ridiculous, almost comically evil philosophies, ideals, and actions drown out the little positive about him. 

Hitler being anti-animal cruelty doesn’t magically make animal cruelty good and doesn’t magically make Hitler good.
                                **Which was exactly the dude's point.**

Why did you all gang up on him like he was an asshole who was wrong? This literally was his point.

If I stay on Reddit too long, I swear I'm gonna get a fucking hemmorhage.
            But...that....that's their point
    You're right, I judge Ayn Rand...I mean Andrew Ryan's ideas on the fact that they kill people and enrich utter fucking sociopaths. Rapture was doomed to fail the moment a man like Ryan thought of it.
        How do Ayn Rand's ideas kill people and enrich sociopaths?
            Actively forsaking altruism, the idea that people are useless parasites unless they're profitable in all things, the very idea that men like Ryan are in any way self-made, a lack of any commitment to the common good or society, scorn for any form of regulation, seeing social safety nets as a bad thing, and I could go on and on. 

Rand refined the capitalist/libertarian ethos into a modern idealogy that espouses profit and selfish objectivism over compassion and base humanity. Which empowers sociopaths who believe in the myth of infinite growth and treat people like numbers to wreak havoc on the world and stack the deck in their favor against the people who make them their money. Hell, Rapture is a direct reference to Galt's Gulch, the wonderland Rand envisioned in Atlas Shrugged where all the rich ass hats go after literally nuking the means of production so the "parasitic" poor can't benefit from their absence.
                What a gish-gallop of an argument. 

>Actively forsaking altruism

My guess is you're using this term in a different way than Rand does. I'm guessing you mean it to be simple charity. Rand means it as complete self-sacrifice to the needs of others.

> idea that people are useless parasites unless they're profitable in all things

Where does Rand say this?

>the very idea that men like Ryan are in any way self-made

How aren't they?

>a lack of any commitment to the common good or society

What's a common good?

I'd venture if I asked a Christian what the common good is they'd say for everyone to be a Christian and serve their fellow Christians. I'd venture a guess that you would not consider this to be "common good". I'd further venture the Christian would disagree with what you consider "the common good".

>scorn for any form of regulation

The free market actively provides regulation without government intervention.

>seeing social safety nets as a bad thing

Social safety nets aren't a bad thing. It's government involvement in them and compulsion to pay into them that are the bad things in objectivism.

>and I could go on and on

Bring it on.

>Rand refined the capitalist/libertarian ethos into a modern idealogy that espouses profit and selfish objectivism over compassion and base humanity.

Profit, you mean what's gained by both members to a voluntary transaction?

"Selfish", there's nothing wrong with rational self-interest.

Compassion, again, what's compassion and how is Rand against it?

Base humanity, ah yes, truly serving humanity is holding a gun to someone's head and making them pay for things for others.

>who believe in the myth of infinite growth

Define the myth of infinite growth and describe how it's a myth.

>treat people like numbers

How does Rand's philosophy lead people to treat others like numbers?

>wreak havoc on the world

How does Rand's philosophy lead people to wreak havoc on the world?

> stack the deck in their favor against the people who make them their money

How does Rand's philosophy lead people to stack the deck in their favor against the people who make them their money?

>Rand envisioned in Atlas Shrugged where all the rich ass hats go after literally nuking the means of production so the "parasitic" poor can't benefit from their absence.

Why is anyone entitled to the innovation, mind, or labor of another?
                    1. Rand means it in the sense of any societal safety net or sacrificing self-interest in the slightest. Her "heroes" are all self-serving ass hats who embody the myth of the self-made man ignoring that their workers and society as a whole enabled made the making of that money. In addition, she seems to ascribe to the “Great Man” theory of history which is just flat-out wrong.

2. Have you read Atlas Shrugged? It’s full of her macho business Daddies going on and on about how there are two types of people in the world, comparing most people to parasites. Not to mention the whole train tunnel sequence where she gleefully recounts thousands of people dying or the terrorist working for Galt that blows up the means of production so the “parasite” workers can’t seize them.

3. I’m glad you asked, men like Ryan, and their modern-day counterparts, are built by investments made into society itself, public infrastructure which they exploit, and being utter sociopaths to accumulate power and wealth. Ryan only got to where he was because of a lack of regulation, luck, and a cutthroat attitude that allowed him to become a modern-day robber baron literally burning down forests to stop them from being nationalized. 

4. I don’t know, clean drinking water and food, public roads and highways to allow freedom of movement for both economic and personal reasons, robust public programs that help people improve themselves and their situation instead of letting poverty consume them while the well to do live off their labor. Public health via regulation on pollutants/food safety/health care, and personal protections for marginalized groups and labor rights. All the things men like Ryan hate because it’s harder to control your workers when they have their basic needs met.

5.  The fuck it does. Insulin, a vital drug that’s so easy to make it was patented for $2, is hundreds of times more expensive in the US because the Pharma companies can charge it. Rivers were literally lighting on fire before regulation forced the companies dumping chemicals to stop. Company stores, industrial rape in mining communities, and child laborers were all major common issues across the US before the labor movement fought for and won protections under the law. The Free Market regulates itself about as much as a child with a plate of cookies does, they will always do all they can to make as much money as possible, no matter the personal or environmental cost. Hell, look out your window at the looming climate crisis, oil companies knew all about Climate Change going as far back as the fifties, but goose-stepped their way into it anyway, all for profit. If you honestly believe the free market regulates itself, you’re incredibly naive.

6. States (in the national sense), municipalities, and communities are the only entities capable of running a social safety net, and taxpayers paying into those social safety nets are always a net gain if they’re robust enough to actually improve people’s lives. Relying on a private option or charity does not work, under Reagan, he used the myth of the welfare queen to cut social program spending which led to an almost unprecedented increase in food insecurity while his complete stonewalling of aid for the AIDS crisis killed thousands of people. When the richest, most powerful government on earth focuses more on toppling democratically elected governments in South America, pouring billions into defense contractors' coffers, and the myth of trickle-down economics people die. The New Deal, while being capitalism’s last saving grace before an inevitable worker’s revolt, saved this country and millions of people were uplifted out of poverty because of it. Excuse me if I don’t trust the robber barons who want to go back to a time before it.

7. “Rational self-interest” has always been code for “I don’t think everyone deserves their basic needs met because I like the power it gives me”. And in the world Rand espouses, and Rapture demonstrates it’s not so much voluntary when one or two assholes can take over an entire industry/niche and then price gouge the fuck out of everyone. Profit is a drug that’s going to kill us all, a desire for profit led a fucking fruit company to use the CIA to coup a democratically elected leader because he wanted his country to control their fruit orchards, and profit led to Oil companies knowingly walking us into a climate disaster that could end all life as we know it, profit led to a mother deciding how long she can starve herself so her child can get the medicine they need to live. Living in a truly functioning and just society means investing in that society, taxes are part of that considering you use roads, sewers, and all the numerous programs that make your life as safe as can be (I.E the fire department, the FDA keeping you from eating poison or fake food, and the EPA keeping your water safe to drink ETC.) That’s compassion, paying into the system so that you and your fellow man can live in a society where they won’t be written off because they fell through the cracks, Rand is a hypocrite (died on government assistance gladly) and the mother of the worst aspect of Capitalist thought.

8. Look at the stock market, look at every company that demands growth year over year while still making insane amounts of profit. Taking and taking while all the while reducing what they’re actually offering and doing all they can to escape liability for their mistakes. Look at the Sacklers who fed the opioid crisis to grow their business exponentially year after year or the price of life-saving drugs (mostly paid for by federal taxpayer money) just to make even more insane profit, look at oil companies who killed every step towards a cleaner future and are fixing/overcharging for their products to make record profits while the world slips into climate coma. Capitalism demands infinite growth to please shareholders who have no idea what the real world is, and in that infinite growth myth, it aspires to its highest form. A cancer cell strangling the rest of humanity.

9. When all of your concern is your own self-interest, profits, and a disregard for safety or regulation of any kind the people actually generating that wealth become just another number. Look at how labor in this country treated people, especially women and children, in the gilded age and company town era. Children often worked in factories losing fingers and limbs on an industrial scale, and in the hay day of the company town, industrial-scale rape was practically institutionalized so sick or wounded men wouldn’t be thrown out on the street. This naturally leads to the red lining and Robert Moses’ active destruction of any chance for walkable cities in America and the advent of sealing off entire communities to die because they were poor and or POC. 

10. Lack of regulation (Climate change, mass exploitation of marginalized groups, health crises like the ones that saw the formation of the FDA) leads to death, sickness, and exploitation on a societal scale. Not to mention that Rand’s objectivism philosophy lends itself well to colonialism and imperialism just with a capitalist “Great man” theory bent.

11. See 10. because unregulated capitalists will do all they can to give themselves more power and money while stripping any chance of mobility from the workforce that makes them their money. Otherwise known as the “fuck you got mine” attitude that people like Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and every “self-made” man espouses.

12. Because they didn’t build it, workers did. Engineers, researchers, laborers, and everyone else who had a hand in the creation, innovation, and growth of the organization. If Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk alone could make a billion dollars without the thousands of people minimum it took to make it, then by all means do it, but in reality, they aren’t the gods amongst men that Rand paints men like them as. They’re just good at exploiting people, our toxic capitalist system, and making the cold calls that accrue the money they didn’t earn. Ryan didn’t build Rapture, Musk didn’t create Space X’s rockets or even found Tesla, and Bezos got extremely lucky and had nearly half a million dollars from his folks to create Amazon. If they alone had twenty dollars and a can-do attitude they’d die in the gutter like the rest of us. 

TL;DR: You missed the point of Bioshock because it touches on every fucking point I did. If you want to read about Rand's business daddies and fucking fountain heads, then by all means do, just don't base your world view on it.
    While I do agree with your point, this is kind of a strange forum to bring it up in.  However, I also think the response you got is disproportionately negative for no real reason, not sure what that's about.
        It’s classic group think. Whenever people see a downvoted post they want to downvote it themselves to feel like they’re part of the in group, without really thinking much about wrong or right. 

If you scroll down I’m literally being downvoted for saying the Nazi’s were bad because of genocide. People don’t think about it, they just want to be part of the group. 

Quite ironic when you think about it lol.
            >	If you scroll down I’m literally being downvoted for saying the Nazi’s were bad because of genocide.


Yeah…that’s not why you’re being downvoted.
                Honestly, why then?  He was being a bit...strong headed, but that seemed to be the main point he was making.
                    >	Honestly, why then?  He was being a bit…strong headed, but that seemed to be the main point he was making.

Because he is completely ignoring that Andrew Ryan had a shitty personality in addition to shitty philosophy, and shitty actions.

Edit: plus the whole defending Hitler bit.
                        Well, I think you're missing their point.  He's not saying that Andrew Ryan has a good personality, or ignoring that it's bad...he's saying that it's not a good reason *on its own* to dislike his politics.   It's basically an ad hominem argument.

Andrew Ryan could have a great personality and we would still disagree with their politics.  A hypothetical person may be a complete asshole, but I might still like their politics (see the current "lesser of two evils" state of US politics).

The question is just...why do we need to talk about his personality at all when discussing their politics?

Also, where did he defend Hitler...?

I firmly believe Ryan’s personality fueled his actions, and it bears discussion. His stubbornness, his pride, his lack of empathy, and his greed all fed into his decision to build Rapture, his choice of government style, and his ineptitude in dealing with Fontaine. 

No, someone’s personality doesn’t always merit a discussion. Sometimes it even detracts from the discussion. That is not the case when it comes to Andrew Ryan. 

>	Also, where did he defend Hitler…?

Alright, I’ll admit I misinterpreted one their comments.
                                Ah, now I understand you. Yes, I would agree with all of your points then :) Sorry to drag this on for so long, but thanks for humoring me.
    You’re making it seem like Andrew Ryan is an actual sentient being and not pixels.
    I dont agree with ryans ideas, but even then why is this post being disliked? Ideas are ideas no matter who came up with them
    >	An asshole can say something that’s a good idea. Or a kind person can say something that’s a bad idea. You shouldn’t use Andrew Ryan’s personality to judge his ideas.


You should judge people based on their personality traits *and* their actions. In addition to being an egotistical asshole  Andrew Ryan did not have a single redeeming action in the entirety of the Bioshock franchise. From the word “go,” his actions and ideology were remarkably bad.
    Okay dude I get what you’re going for but prob not the best example to die on the hill for 💀
        I’m never going to apologize and delete a post that’s objectively correct.
    The absolute refusal of most of those replying to you to even engage with the ideas is sad.
    i would recommend watching young sheldon on cbs
I like the whole "No Gods, No Kings, Only Man" bit. Sounds kinda Anarchistic. Everything else, No
    Yeah I like that bit but he doesn't really execute that vision
    Well the idea as it is written isn't terrible. It's just that right above it is a giant venerating bronze bust of his own head sneering down at the humbled observer. Rather defeats the whole slogan.
    Because it's propaganda?
This guy built an entire city based on his own very personal ideals.

Rapture was a literal social and political fly-trap, bring all these ideologists and entrepreneurs here and see what they do given a incredibly loose and unregulated system.

Honestly, the fact he has his genetic family able to heal for free while the rest cannot should speak volumes about Rapture policy / corruption.
    I mean, that's literally the anarchist moto, but he added men. Which in and of itself breaks the whole ordeal și c e it just replaces the oppressive role of a god and a king and gives it to men. Which isn't what anarchism is about
    Yeah but right wing libertarians have been appropriating the language of anarchists from the start, even going so far as to call themselves anarcho capitalists. It's just buzzwords coming from him
    agreed!! andrew ryan had the right idea but went about it the complete wrong way. like completely the wrong way lol
    Very accurate. With respect of property rights or contracts (at least initially at its start), very Anacap.
    Ryan had one good idea.
At this point it's evolved into much more it's an actual good discussion
You totally roasted them
Their “do you agree with?” posts are as funny as getting diagnosed with cancer. So fucking sick of them. I left that subreddit to get away from their dumbass jokes, but here we are.

I think rapture is going pretty well
He's honestly way too capitalistic for my liking
    Agreed. I'm very much on the side of marx in this debate 😅
        I mean Marx isn't that wrong.....
            Did you play the second Bioshock?
                Lamb is more a collectivist cult than analogous to communism in the text. She espouses something closer to a religious commune than the economic system of communism as she's still at the top of a hierarchy while the people don't really control anything. Ryan represents Randian objectivism and capitalism, but Lamb doesn't represent Communism, just a radical collectivism that sacrifices the individual.
                    That’s what communism is, though. The root word of communism is “commune” which refers to a collectivist society
                        because root words = definition
                            Yes. Words mean what they mean. That’s why root words exist. That’s how you know “hydrotherapy” means “water therapy” or how you know “Annual” is derived from the Latin Anno meaning year or how Dominion and Dominance both come from the Latin Dominus meaning Lord
                                “Words mean what they mean”

Yeah, and what they mean is not tied to the letters that form them. This is such a strange argument to make considering there are hundreds of words whose meanings differ than their roots. Especially for a word like communism which comes from a word meaning “for the community” and not “a collectivist society” or whatever you just pulled out of thin air.

Edit: literally in your own example, you say two words that come from “the lord” and yet have nothing to do with it now. You don’t seem to grasp how language works.
                    "a radical collectivism that sacrifices the individual" Yeah communism
                        Marxism is deliberately anarchistic and rejects both hierarchy and statism. Lamb, by definition, is not a Marxist. Maybe, *maybe* a commentary on Stalinism's authoritarian collectivism and cult of personality, but certainly not in any way a valid critique of actual Marxism.

                Marx actually contributed alot to the devolpment and reform to human rights. Much like the early soviet union

                        I'm literally taking a class on the soviet union, and WWI

The soviet union devolped large amounts of Human rights under the rule of Bolchevic. It was the first time women had complete equality. It wasn't until he died and Stalin came in power that the soviet union became a mess.
                            Wonder how many women scholars would agree that women had complete equality in soviet russia.
                                They did specify "before Stalin" which is fair enough.  During Stalin's rule and ever since after, Russia has been a human rights nightmare I don't think anyone would deny that.
                                Original values were that people were people.
                            yeah , and that's exactly the point. communism became a mess because it doesn't work. people will always mess it.
                                Communism under an authoritarian government will never work because it’s an oppressive system. We’ve yet to see an example of democratic communism
Is that actually the inflation rate for it? That's like more than I make 2 weeks
    I miscalculated and used 1969 instead of 1960. Here are the prices adjusting for inflation in USD assuming that's the standard Rapture goes by. Source [here](https://www.in2013dollars.com/)

$16 would be $160.44

$20 would be $200.55  


Edit: At a wage of $15 for a 7.5 hour day you'd make $112.5 gross pay
        Damn thats like half my income. Like Actually lol.
            Here in Canada that's minimum wage, even counting for inflation that price for a medkit or health station is substantially lower than American healthcare and treatment would be practically instantaneous as opposed to taking time off of work and losing money in the process.
Your $20 comes from the prices in the Circus of Values ?  

Consider thats the premium prices from a shortage run society situation. (and a vending machine).

Wouldnt it be likely to be cheaper when bought in a shop before the Chaos in Rapture began ?  Competition based  pricing ?

Perhaps half  or even a quarter as much ?

.
    Consider the fact that manufacturers of medkits could charge whatever they want if it's lucrative, and for a full restoration of even near fatal injuries within seconds that price is still insanely low compared to a doctor. IRL something like that would fetch thousands of dollars a shot, if you're working a low paying job that's dangerous you can't afford a doctor OR missing days or weeks of work while recovering so one of these could mean the difference between getting back to work or losing your home and job. The point of  the matter is that medkits and health stations even when adjusted for inflation would still be incredibly cheap, I'll look up what stitches and a broken arm will cost in America without health insurance.  


For patients without health insurance, stitches typically cost $200-$3,000 or more, depending on the provider, the injury and the complexity of the repair.  


Without health insurance, surgical treatment of a broken arm typically costs $16,000 or more.

As I've said even if the medkit cost 4X the amount ($802.20 adjusted for inflation in USD) it would still be incredibly cheap compared to your average medical bill. If I was making $15 an hour it would take about a week to pay off a medkit instead of months or years of my income. At its regular price that would take 13.37 hours of work to pay for a medkit, I still don't see the point you're trying to make here.
        > medkits could charge whatever they want if it's lucrative

consider 2 companies competing in Rapture

now the 'price' is relative to actual expenses with a sufficient profit

they never said its a monopoly (to the contrary actually)
            It could cost $2-$5 to make one, still a good profit for only $20. You sound like you just want to argue even though I've provided sufficient data to back up my opinion.
                Have you missed what I said about competition ?

DO you understand what happens to prices when companies compete for customers?

And as I said before  : this is a vending machine price (middleman + overhead  involved) .   A shop price in NORMAL Rapture could easily be half your $20.

Post Chaos Rapture when money is nearly worthless and being found on the ground - it doesnt even make sense that all the machines are NOT EMPTY (if Raptures in as bad a state as the writers want to make the situation ). 

.
                    I'm referring to medkits in competition with doctors and normal medical treatment, I made it abundantly clear that I was in each response. If you're still not seeing the point I can't help you any further.
                        yes and if the kits work very well the doctors dont have much to do and likely move on to do things the kits cant do

more complicated operations.therapies would likely still require manual applications (including ADAM)

we are talking about costs of medi-kits not doctor treatments

$20 in a vending machine ...

you think a shop in NORMAL Rapture has it for the same price ?

if you can easily buy it in a shop then you dont in a machine 

machines aspect is being convenient which in our world people are willing to pay the premium price for (or the machines wouldnt exist)
                            A quote from the first thing I said here.

"...it would have revolutionized healthcare for such a low price as to have put doctors out of business aside from specialists and top surgeons. Your average GP would be screwed with health stations in very convenient locations..."

You're literally repeating what I said earlier while making baseless speculations on prices, and to my knowledge there was only one company making medkits to begin with. I feel like you're intentionally trying to argue at this point so I won't bother responding to you anymore, you're going in circles at this point.
                                >	You’re literally repeating what I said earlier while making baseless speculations on prices, and to my knowledge there was only one company making medkits to begin with.

Yep. That’s u/premer777 for you. They look at Rapture and say “hey, this is a good idea. That Andrew Ryan is a pretty swell fellow.” 

Welcome to the wonderful world of Ryan fanboys.
                                except Im trying to get thru to you that your $20 price out of a machine may : during a chaos world dystopia  ISNT THE SAME as when its in  NORMAL Rapture and when sold in shops (and with likely multiple manufacturers) .

you seem to be the one going off on tangents irrelevant to that point

No. It would deny you service, and then you die. At least the US medical system doesn’t do that if you’re too poor to pay. 

Do you ever wonder if there were homeless in Rapture? Do you ever wonder if Rapture citizens had to pay for air? It’s an enclosed bubble, after all, in an ecosystem hostile to human life. Air is a service that must be produced, and therefore most likely paid for. What happens to someone if they can’t pay?
Yeah I completely understand. For Ryan it was all about money.
Idk makes money
    Rapture is a perfect example of why the blind pursuit of capital is a bad a idea.
Honestly Ryan backs alot of policies
FOR REAL
Well, Rapture kinda didn't work in general.
    It was doomed from the start as it's inspiration Galt's Gulch was.
    It’s a game, not a real life scenario. All of the ideas are hypothetical there, just like in Infinite, as we didn’t try anything near those systems.
or nobody pays for it and they just make some doctors slaves
Unless they remove money as a whole and then BAM Ryan creates communism
Or make the rich pay the taxes. Done
    Or make the rich pay
Okay but french is based
Uwu
This is the right idea. You really don't have freedom in a heavily capitalistic society
    Exactly the gripe me and a lot of other people have. You don't think about it much but there are a ton of aspects of our lives we straight-up don't get to have a choice in because we are fundamentally forced to engage in the system.
        Yeah I mean capitalism is based off exploitation so it makes sense
            Precisely. A pity saying so is oft considered getting too political.

(Even though being political is the whole point of Bioshock, but I'd digress.)
                If we can't talk about politics in a political Game what's the point
youve taken the 'sweat of the brow' literally ?

you seriously leave out the right to property ?  (remember the Forest thing ??)

go to r/objectivism to understand better what objectivism is.

.
The view was nice tho
Respecting ones father is important
    It is. Andrew Ryan is actually a traditionalist at heart. That’s why he named Big Daddies Big Daddy.
rapture had been subjected to terrorism by super-powered anarchists

we see it in the game AFTER its been thoroughly disrupted/half-destroyed  by that.
Why are you booing this man, he's right?

(He's talking about executives of the pharmaceutical industry who leech off of people's need for life-saving medical care.)

Yes but also I'm curious about free Healthcare
the thing about BioShock (Rapture) was it was a reflection of the way the world was pre-FDR/Wilson - a time when things ran without all the socialism and welfare state.

---

Objectivism has checks and balances in it and a different balancing point then the current society. 

Consider that doctors in rapture have to compete for patients and THAT lowers the price of healthcare

Now add  the current government overhead and inefficiency that eats a huge chunk of the taxpayer money spent on it (as well as NOW interfering with the care that doctors can give). 

.

> ryan never accounted for terrible behavior 

Things called laws and crimes - basic things to have in a society.

Under Objectivism, your rights end where your behavior  starts intruding on others rights - and those rights include your safety and possessions and privacy. 

They did not speak much of such things in the game (as they had to make Ryan into the bogeyman to get you to blindly follow a sociopath).   

We did  see splicers dressed as cops.

You cannot run a city (for over 10 years) operating under anarchy.   There had to be some system of justice existing.

The portrayal of Rapture was not supposed to be some fantasy, rather a reflection of society on the surface.

.
    Okay when yaron brook says the game isn't objectivist or correctly says her ideas idk why you're bringing ayn rand into this. Yes they based ryan off John galt but it hardly means you can drag in ayn rand to justify your point when the game misrepresents so many of her ideas. 
Also ayn rand would hardly every utter the phrase "petty mortality" so don't throw her into this. 
Even on top of that I meant he never accounted for a sociopathic grifter who was willing to do anything and everything for his own sake or any of the psychos of rapture. He was so laizze Faire he literally forgot basic ethics.
        you will have to spell out which of the ayn rand ideas you say the game misrepresents

Ive already said many times before that the writers had to create a dystopia and so conflictingly/contradictorally avoided significant elements of  objectivism/libertarianism  - like a (competing) free press what would have instantly denounced Fontaine as a seller of poison (the insanity and disfigurement/cancer), thus ending/nullifying his story role of becoming an industrial  mogul to rival Ryan.

He accounted for miscreants and had security to take care of that if not also an operational system of constables to handle such things.

And again (once informed) the sociopathic grifter would be quickly done away with in a society which is supposed to empower the citizens.  Rapture was a small place that he could not run from the reaction the population would have to his criminal behavior.

.
            Okay fair enough, firstly the issue is a large amount of half ideas. Essentially ayn rand had her philosophy as an integrated whole, meaning to agree with one is to agree with all of it and inturn rand herself. 
So firstly, one example I have already given you, ayn rand would not ever approve of a society that discounts morality and props up uninhibited behavior as much as ryan does. For instance in the rapture novel two grocery store owners are competing, but one owns essentially the market for the whole of the area garbage, charging his competitor double to drive his grocery store out of business. Ryan ignored this and basically said tough luck, instead of rand which would encourage the community not to indulge in such unethical behavior as to drive out competition through a corporatist tactic. 
Another is that rand would never support or allow any form of government nationalization or possession as ryan industries took fontaines company after the revolt. Rand would never consider that anything but unethical and completely against her ideas of laizze Faire, even with the revolution. Essentially she would clearly see it as wrong for any form of state to claim ownership of a company. 
Another is that there is room for ethics, rand would vomit at the idea of anything involving the violations of medical ethics or even the countless issues of the little sisters, considering she viewed such things as being antithetical to a moral society. 
I can go on but if you want to learn more Read ayn rand and the virtuous egoist. That book outlines a large idea of her beliefs but ultimately will tell you how differently she viewed the world from andrew ryan. It's a corruption of objectivist ideas to have all the epistemology and poltics, but none of the complete ethics.

Edit Apologies it seems I talked past you. Yes ideally that would be an idea in objectivism, however it would not be an idea that ryan would allow atleast as far as the characters actions would say. But I will say andrew ryan is not an objectivist by any stretch and moe the anarchocapitlist from hell,lol.
                ayn rand is not the 'end all and be all' of Objectivism.

> that discounts morality and props up uninhibited behavior as much as ryan does. 


What does he prop up ?  And use examples of what was in original pre-kashmir rapture and not in the chaos rapture where society had already disintegrated  and Ryan is in emergency/war mode.

Consider that Fontaines crimes were done in secret -- indicating it was NOT freely allowed or accepted or 'uninhibited'.

The writers hardly allowed any action by the populace as they needed that easy dystopia story 

Also the author of the  'rapture novel' has  just ups the stuff in the game (again I assert its post chaos an dNOT normal Rapture)  as most takes place before the chaos begins and he needs all the action to spice up the book.

I've elsewhere explained where the Grocery store guy story is bosh because it ignores so ***MANY*** possible alternates the victim had to to the abusive neighbor short of shooting him. The common neighborhood mechanism were completely ignored (just pay a kid to haul your trash guy ...) The author had to simpleton-style prop up the 'dystopia'  (perhaps didn't want to contradict the games similar pattern of ignorance).  Seriously  Its like these people HADNT operated in the mean world of the surface before they got to rapture.  

The nationalized Fontaine Futuistsics is similar 'baaaad ryan'  smear.   The addicts needed ADAM, Fontaines assets would have been used for reparations to his victims and the 3 1/2 month period this happen (before the terrorist chaos began) didnt allow any story of what was to be done in a more complete plan.

So really its the writers who needing their 'easy' story for a slaughter-fest dystopia, ignored basics of objectivism/libertarianism and carelessly contrive a storyline with its 'hate ryan' mantra to cover for that midgame 'plot twist'  (and no Choice  to NOT follow the sociopath atlas - not giving their twist  away to the player) 

I can say this because the writers are inconsistent and have things so contradictory to what they say Rapture operated (and what the world in general operates through).

You’ve mentioned this idea of Ryan using Fontaine Futuristics as reparations. It was hilarious then and hilarious now. What evidence can you provide fron *any* of Andrew Ryan’s words or actions would ***ever*** give you the idea that he would use the assets for reparations? What evidence can you provide fron *any* of Andrew Ryan’s words or actions would ***ever*** even attempt to consider paying reparations? 

What evidence can you provide fron *any* of Andrew Ryan’s words or actions that indicated Ryan even had a plan to fix Adam? An inkling of an idea that he would try to fix Adam? 

>	contrive a storyline with its ‘hate ryan’ mantra to cover for that midgame ‘plot twist’  (and no Choice  to NOT follow the sociopath atlas - not giving their twist  away to the player)

Did you miss the part where it was Andrew Ryan demanding Jack kill him? Ryan was there. Ryan was in full control. Ryan could have ordered Jack away, could have conceivably ordered Jack to kill Atlas. Instead, he decided to pick up his toys and go home. Ryan decided to blow up his city, and order his son to brutally beat him to death, and even turned off his private vita chamber so Ryan wouldn’t be reborn. 

>	I can say this because the writers are inconsistent and have things so contradictory to what they say Rapture operated

You’ve claimed this before, but have never once been able to back it up. What was inconsistent about the writing of Bioshock? What was contradictory in the plot? I’m eagerly awaiting an example.
                        cant help you if you have no understanding about how things work.

your simpleton arguments are always 'it was never said in the game' 

and my reply is that the game if full of gaps and vagaries where much which HAD TO BE THERE  was never mentioned.

Insults without any kind of evidence. Classic u/premer777.

I pulled out specific things to address because you claim they’re in character. Show me the evidence. 

I’m still waiting for an example of a contradiction, fyi.
            >	 like a (competing) free press what would have instantly denounced Fontaine as a seller of poison (the insanity and disfigurement/cancer), thus ending/nullifying his story role of becoming an industrial  mogul to rival Ryan.

Rapture *did* have a competitive free press. There were multiple news papers, including Ryan’s own Rapture Tribune, in addition to a number of magazines and novels. 

There are no known headlines about Adam side effects. There is one about Adam shortages due to the war. 

You paint this hyper idealized version of the press and frankly capitalism as a whole, which is *not* grounded in reality. It’s certainly not grounded in the reality of the “Pre-FDR” US that you’ve insisted on multiple times. Things like bribery and intimidation of journalists were and continue to be a thing.

Edit. Meanwhile, we even have an example of a journalist who accepted bribes not to report on Adam: Stanely Poole.
                

'Free Press' that misses the whole  INSANITY, DEFORMATION CANCERY STUFF with ADAM  - conveniently until Ryan is now able to be blamed for it is my simple argument --- with the Game Writers playing with the  story details to make them fit their BLAME RYAN plot.

So the Writers inconsistency about an ACTUALLY WORKING  Free Press is not really there for that one VERY IMPORTANT game explanation.

You might want to review what I was referencing about Pre-Wilson/FDR as to the less regulated capitalism in the US.  If you don't know what I am talking about, you have a huge gap in your understanding of US History.

Andrew Ryan *isn’t* blamed for the side effects. There *are* no newspaper headlines about Adam side effects, period. 

What Ryan *is* blamed for is his inaction towards Adam. 

>	So the Writers inconsistency about an ACTUALLY WORKING  Free Press is not really there for that one VERY IMPORTANT game explanation.

As a reminder, “free press” means free from government intervention and government censorship. It doesn’t mean “always perusing the truth in the name of the best interest of the people.” 

For example, the US has free press. The US’s press coverage of certain events can be extremely disappointing.

Interestingly enough, Andrew Ryan actually kills the free press in Rapture. He orders all publications to cease, and places a lock down on the PA system. 

>	You might want to review what I was referencing about Pre-Wilson/FDR as to the less regulated capitalism in the US.  If you don’t know what I am talking about, you have a huge gap in your understanding of US History.

It’s like you’ve never heard of price fixing, captive markets, company towns, monopolies, etc. Do you understand *why* the Progressive Era happened in the US? Hint: Unregulated capitalism which resulted in widespread abuses of workers and consumers. Oh, hey, and let’s not forget child labor in factories, and mines. 

People who ~~live in glass houses~~ don’t know what free press and price fixing are shouldn’t throw throw stones.

There are pros and cons to each scenarios, there are no wrong answers here
    I agree, it’s such a tough situation
        Yeah discussions like this have no right answer
            You have sparked up a good discussion though!

I think I ask an important question
2 things are upsetting people here.
1. The politics
2. The refrence to batman arkham
    I mean I can somewhat understand the politics, however the entire point is his politics resulted in a shitshow but at least it’s decent conversation. I’m more talking about the people losing their minds over the r/batmanarkham joke. I personally find the subreddit hilarious but usually the mature thing to do if you don’t like a post is downvote and move on with your life. There’s multiple comments here over people legitimately letting this post ruin their day and it’s hilarious to see
        Yeah and one that crossed Comments to be angry at me in another.
You missed the entire point of the game
did u play the game?
This is sarcastic, or? This has to be a joke.
Your right when the rapture council stoped elections and used the rapture security like a military occupied force the whole fragile card pile collapsed. The only thing Ryan did wrong was to not adhere to the nonaggression principle and to run the city in a authoritarian fashion.
    Totalitarian is pogging
    they had elections ?

it was never described

most of the authoritarian things you saw was done after there was a 'civil war' with a bunch of splicer terrorists tearing up the city and endangering everyones survival
        The elections happened before the war and can be found mentions in the audio files of the game
    >	Your right when the rapture council stoped elections

There were no elections in Rapture. 

>	The only thing Ryan did wrong was […] to run the city in a authoritarian fashion.

Talk about burying the lede.
        A propaganda playlet in BioShock 2 Multiplayer mentions that the elections to choose new members for the city council were postponed several times in the months leading up to the Rapture Civil War. So yeah they did
            >	A propaganda playlet in BioShock 2 Multiplayer mentions that the elections to choose new members for the city council were postponed several times in the months leading up to the Rapture Civil War. So yeah they did

Interesting. I never played the multiplayer. 

Fascinating that the playlet is the only direct mention of elections.
                I mean they only show glimpses of pre civil war the main game is set in a post civil war and in anarchy so its not the main focus. Also bill McDonagh mentions elections in an audio diary but is a blink and you miss it thing
                    >	I mean they only show glimpses of pre civil war the main game is set in a post civil war and in anarchy so its not the main focus.

Not really. The audio diaries make it abundantly clear all was not well in Zion prior to the Civil War.
It's definitely getting locked

Idk about where you live, but in Australia (which has mildly public with private health care options) you need a Medicare card to get anything for free, which is basically proof you pay taxes. Foreigners can’t get Medicare cards
I'm not opposed to both existing in a market, the same way that we have public schools and private schools, but public healthcare has to be a guaranteed right for everyone, and funded appropriately.  We have an issue of underfunding public education in the US, which is why it doesn't perform well in some communities.
Privatised means you have to pay extortionate prices
    Yeah but with internalized private Healthcare you have far less people receiving government Healthcare. Which means it's faster

        Tell that to every specialist I have to wait 5-6 months to see but still have to pay $500 with insurance for treatments.
        Tbh the UK has a mixed system, NHS providing public healthcare and private healthcare providers like Bupa or AXA etc. And we have one of the most shitty, underfunded healthcare systems in Europe. Miles better than the US, but still the shit one compared to other countries that have public healthcare. Fact is private companies can very easily sway policy, it's what happened with our rail service, our postal service and what corporate politicians like the entirety of the conservative party and the majority of labour end up doing to every public service. Private options for what should be public services open the door for corporate meddling until there's no good option left

American healthcare system has unparalleled responsiveness, with an emergency wait room time of merely 58 minutes as opposed to Britain's three hours…

Financially though, the US system is broken af.
                This is a misreading of my point. I'm not claiming that the UK has better wait times than the US, I'm saying that it surpasses the IS in accessibility. Sure we have longer wait times, mostly for things that aren't life threatening triage is always necessary when there's a high enough volume of patients, the thing is it still far outpaces the US in one very important regard. The wait times in America may be shorter, but this only applies if you can afford to pay. It's inevitable that the US would have shorter wait times because all too often people can't afford to be treated in the first place. I should have made it clear that I was comparing the UK to the rest of Europe with regard to wait times and quality of care etc and not the us because America doesn't share the most basic requirement of medical care: that people are actually able to get it. Also even in the quality of care department I'd say the UK pulls ahead because there isn't the same prevalence of over prescription of opioids leading to a national crisis of addiction in the UK as in the US.

Tldr UK still vastly outpaces US in medical care because it's accessible and not the source of an opioid crisis.
                    Hummm. This seems to be a completely new point you are making now, so I’m not sure how it’s a misreading of your original point. 

Your original points were (1) that the UK has a mixed system, (2) the UK health system is shitty and underfunded (But “miles better than. The US”), (3) private companies sway policy, and (perhaps) destroy “every public service”. 

I appreciate your brand spanking new accessibility argument. 

I didn’t really make an argument. My point was to show a couple articles to rebut your original sub-point, that is, that the UK system is “miles better than the US system”.  With respect to accessibility, I agree with you. But there are many metrics in which the US system is far better than the UK system. I don’t really care either way.
                        Yeah I didn't specify how the UK has a better system than the US, I assumed it was clear that I could be talking about any number of things. It's not that it's a new point, I just wasn't being too specific about it. Sure the other metrics may exist, but they in no way make up for the glaring flaws with the American system, but again that's just something I wasn't specific enough on is all
                            Agreed, though. The US system is shit. :-)
This has not actually borne out in reality. Wait times in the US are comparable in peer nations with universal healthcare systems.
You don't get faster care with privatized Healthcare.  You get faster care when you have easier access and less red tape.  There are many many studies confirming this, and showing that the US Healthcare system isn't faster, but it is way more expensive when compared to other countries.
Why tf did this get downvoted to oblivion???? American-centric people have no idea that private health care is really good for people who can afford to pay for faster and better services, and public health care is a lot slower but still good.
    Because I'm wrong?
        It's literally not wrong.
uhhhh LMAO
That's like saying you shouldn't judge the nazis because hitler was a dickhead lol
    Correct, you should judge the Nazi’s by the fact they literally genocided millions of people. Not because their leader was an asshole.
        But that goes against what you just said
            No, it doesn’t. I said the personality traits of someone doesn’t matter when assessing that person’s ideas. What made the Nazi’s bad is that they wanted to exterminate an entire race of people. Not that their leader was an asshole.
                But the entire beginning and main reason for the nazi's to start doing what they did is because hitler was a asshole who hated jews,  and he manipulated the people into starting this entire hatred because of the poor conditions Germany was left in after ww1 from the treaty of Versailles
                    So if someone were to ask you why Nazism is bad you think “because Hitler was mean” would be a stronger argument than “because they believed in murdering millions of innocent people”?
                        It doesn't matter about stronger arguments, it matters because the nazis believed in murdering millions of innocents and that hitler was a dickhead who started it all because he was butthurt. Anyways why are you arguing history on a bioshock subreddit? No one cares.
                            You’re literally the one who brought it up. 

And I’m debating this because summarizing Rapture’s demise as “well Andrew Ryan was an asshole” is doing an extreme disservice to Ken Levine and the immense effort put into the game around historical and political commentary. The ideas of this game go way deeper than that.
                            Because like fucking 200 of you dipshits completely missed this random person's point, and I just accidentally stumbled in this thread. 

I don't even really play Bioshock. I played the first one like 10 years ago, it was cool but this little thread managed to piss me off. It’s just so dumb to witness. This is a microcosm of the apparent dumbing down of society in favor of tumorous circle jerks of people desperate for validation.
                    Alright.

Hitler hated animal abuse. Is abusing animals good?
                        >	Alright.

>	Hitler hated animal abuse. Is abusing animals good?

Of course not. Hitler had a few positive philosophies, such as his stance on animal cruelty and vegetarianism. Hitler *also* had far more negative philosophies. His ridiculous, almost comically evil philosophies, ideals, and actions drown out the little positive about him. 

Hitler being anti-animal cruelty doesn’t magically make animal cruelty good and doesn’t magically make Hitler good.
                            **Which was exactly the dude's point.**

Why did you all gang up on him like he was an asshole who was wrong? This literally was his point.

If I stay on Reddit too long, I swear I'm gonna get a fucking hemmorhage.
        But...that....that's their point
You're right, I judge Ayn Rand...I mean Andrew Ryan's ideas on the fact that they kill people and enrich utter fucking sociopaths. Rapture was doomed to fail the moment a man like Ryan thought of it.
    How do Ayn Rand's ideas kill people and enrich sociopaths?
        Actively forsaking altruism, the idea that people are useless parasites unless they're profitable in all things, the very idea that men like Ryan are in any way self-made, a lack of any commitment to the common good or society, scorn for any form of regulation, seeing social safety nets as a bad thing, and I could go on and on. 

Rand refined the capitalist/libertarian ethos into a modern idealogy that espouses profit and selfish objectivism over compassion and base humanity. Which empowers sociopaths who believe in the myth of infinite growth and treat people like numbers to wreak havoc on the world and stack the deck in their favor against the people who make them their money. Hell, Rapture is a direct reference to Galt's Gulch, the wonderland Rand envisioned in Atlas Shrugged where all the rich ass hats go after literally nuking the means of production so the "parasitic" poor can't benefit from their absence.
            What a gish-gallop of an argument. 

>Actively forsaking altruism

My guess is you're using this term in a different way than Rand does. I'm guessing you mean it to be simple charity. Rand means it as complete self-sacrifice to the needs of others.

> idea that people are useless parasites unless they're profitable in all things

Where does Rand say this?

>the very idea that men like Ryan are in any way self-made

How aren't they?

>a lack of any commitment to the common good or society

What's a common good?

I'd venture if I asked a Christian what the common good is they'd say for everyone to be a Christian and serve their fellow Christians. I'd venture a guess that you would not consider this to be "common good". I'd further venture the Christian would disagree with what you consider "the common good".

>scorn for any form of regulation

The free market actively provides regulation without government intervention.

>seeing social safety nets as a bad thing

Social safety nets aren't a bad thing. It's government involvement in them and compulsion to pay into them that are the bad things in objectivism.

>and I could go on and on

Bring it on.

>Rand refined the capitalist/libertarian ethos into a modern idealogy that espouses profit and selfish objectivism over compassion and base humanity.

Profit, you mean what's gained by both members to a voluntary transaction?

"Selfish", there's nothing wrong with rational self-interest.

Compassion, again, what's compassion and how is Rand against it?

Base humanity, ah yes, truly serving humanity is holding a gun to someone's head and making them pay for things for others.

>who believe in the myth of infinite growth

Define the myth of infinite growth and describe how it's a myth.

>treat people like numbers

How does Rand's philosophy lead people to treat others like numbers?

>wreak havoc on the world

How does Rand's philosophy lead people to wreak havoc on the world?

> stack the deck in their favor against the people who make them their money

How does Rand's philosophy lead people to stack the deck in their favor against the people who make them their money?

>Rand envisioned in Atlas Shrugged where all the rich ass hats go after literally nuking the means of production so the "parasitic" poor can't benefit from their absence.

Why is anyone entitled to the innovation, mind, or labor of another?
                1. Rand means it in the sense of any societal safety net or sacrificing self-interest in the slightest. Her "heroes" are all self-serving ass hats who embody the myth of the self-made man ignoring that their workers and society as a whole enabled made the making of that money. In addition, she seems to ascribe to the “Great Man” theory of history which is just flat-out wrong.

2. Have you read Atlas Shrugged? It’s full of her macho business Daddies going on and on about how there are two types of people in the world, comparing most people to parasites. Not to mention the whole train tunnel sequence where she gleefully recounts thousands of people dying or the terrorist working for Galt that blows up the means of production so the “parasite” workers can’t seize them.

3. I’m glad you asked, men like Ryan, and their modern-day counterparts, are built by investments made into society itself, public infrastructure which they exploit, and being utter sociopaths to accumulate power and wealth. Ryan only got to where he was because of a lack of regulation, luck, and a cutthroat attitude that allowed him to become a modern-day robber baron literally burning down forests to stop them from being nationalized. 

4. I don’t know, clean drinking water and food, public roads and highways to allow freedom of movement for both economic and personal reasons, robust public programs that help people improve themselves and their situation instead of letting poverty consume them while the well to do live off their labor. Public health via regulation on pollutants/food safety/health care, and personal protections for marginalized groups and labor rights. All the things men like Ryan hate because it’s harder to control your workers when they have their basic needs met.

5.  The fuck it does. Insulin, a vital drug that’s so easy to make it was patented for $2, is hundreds of times more expensive in the US because the Pharma companies can charge it. Rivers were literally lighting on fire before regulation forced the companies dumping chemicals to stop. Company stores, industrial rape in mining communities, and child laborers were all major common issues across the US before the labor movement fought for and won protections under the law. The Free Market regulates itself about as much as a child with a plate of cookies does, they will always do all they can to make as much money as possible, no matter the personal or environmental cost. Hell, look out your window at the looming climate crisis, oil companies knew all about Climate Change going as far back as the fifties, but goose-stepped their way into it anyway, all for profit. If you honestly believe the free market regulates itself, you’re incredibly naive.

6. States (in the national sense), municipalities, and communities are the only entities capable of running a social safety net, and taxpayers paying into those social safety nets are always a net gain if they’re robust enough to actually improve people’s lives. Relying on a private option or charity does not work, under Reagan, he used the myth of the welfare queen to cut social program spending which led to an almost unprecedented increase in food insecurity while his complete stonewalling of aid for the AIDS crisis killed thousands of people. When the richest, most powerful government on earth focuses more on toppling democratically elected governments in South America, pouring billions into defense contractors' coffers, and the myth of trickle-down economics people die. The New Deal, while being capitalism’s last saving grace before an inevitable worker’s revolt, saved this country and millions of people were uplifted out of poverty because of it. Excuse me if I don’t trust the robber barons who want to go back to a time before it.

7. “Rational self-interest” has always been code for “I don’t think everyone deserves their basic needs met because I like the power it gives me”. And in the world Rand espouses, and Rapture demonstrates it’s not so much voluntary when one or two assholes can take over an entire industry/niche and then price gouge the fuck out of everyone. Profit is a drug that’s going to kill us all, a desire for profit led a fucking fruit company to use the CIA to coup a democratically elected leader because he wanted his country to control their fruit orchards, and profit led to Oil companies knowingly walking us into a climate disaster that could end all life as we know it, profit led to a mother deciding how long she can starve herself so her child can get the medicine they need to live. Living in a truly functioning and just society means investing in that society, taxes are part of that considering you use roads, sewers, and all the numerous programs that make your life as safe as can be (I.E the fire department, the FDA keeping you from eating poison or fake food, and the EPA keeping your water safe to drink ETC.) That’s compassion, paying into the system so that you and your fellow man can live in a society where they won’t be written off because they fell through the cracks, Rand is a hypocrite (died on government assistance gladly) and the mother of the worst aspect of Capitalist thought.

8. Look at the stock market, look at every company that demands growth year over year while still making insane amounts of profit. Taking and taking while all the while reducing what they’re actually offering and doing all they can to escape liability for their mistakes. Look at the Sacklers who fed the opioid crisis to grow their business exponentially year after year or the price of life-saving drugs (mostly paid for by federal taxpayer money) just to make even more insane profit, look at oil companies who killed every step towards a cleaner future and are fixing/overcharging for their products to make record profits while the world slips into climate coma. Capitalism demands infinite growth to please shareholders who have no idea what the real world is, and in that infinite growth myth, it aspires to its highest form. A cancer cell strangling the rest of humanity.

9. When all of your concern is your own self-interest, profits, and a disregard for safety or regulation of any kind the people actually generating that wealth become just another number. Look at how labor in this country treated people, especially women and children, in the gilded age and company town era. Children often worked in factories losing fingers and limbs on an industrial scale, and in the hay day of the company town, industrial-scale rape was practically institutionalized so sick or wounded men wouldn’t be thrown out on the street. This naturally leads to the red lining and Robert Moses’ active destruction of any chance for walkable cities in America and the advent of sealing off entire communities to die because they were poor and or POC. 

10. Lack of regulation (Climate change, mass exploitation of marginalized groups, health crises like the ones that saw the formation of the FDA) leads to death, sickness, and exploitation on a societal scale. Not to mention that Rand’s objectivism philosophy lends itself well to colonialism and imperialism just with a capitalist “Great man” theory bent.

11. See 10. because unregulated capitalists will do all they can to give themselves more power and money while stripping any chance of mobility from the workforce that makes them their money. Otherwise known as the “fuck you got mine” attitude that people like Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and every “self-made” man espouses.

12. Because they didn’t build it, workers did. Engineers, researchers, laborers, and everyone else who had a hand in the creation, innovation, and growth of the organization. If Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk alone could make a billion dollars without the thousands of people minimum it took to make it, then by all means do it, but in reality, they aren’t the gods amongst men that Rand paints men like them as. They’re just good at exploiting people, our toxic capitalist system, and making the cold calls that accrue the money they didn’t earn. Ryan didn’t build Rapture, Musk didn’t create Space X’s rockets or even found Tesla, and Bezos got extremely lucky and had nearly half a million dollars from his folks to create Amazon. If they alone had twenty dollars and a can-do attitude they’d die in the gutter like the rest of us. 

TL;DR: You missed the point of Bioshock because it touches on every fucking point I did. If you want to read about Rand's business daddies and fucking fountain heads, then by all means do, just don't base your world view on it.
While I do agree with your point, this is kind of a strange forum to bring it up in.  However, I also think the response you got is disproportionately negative for no real reason, not sure what that's about.
    It’s classic group think. Whenever people see a downvoted post they want to downvote it themselves to feel like they’re part of the in group, without really thinking much about wrong or right. 

If you scroll down I’m literally being downvoted for saying the Nazi’s were bad because of genocide. People don’t think about it, they just want to be part of the group. 

Quite ironic when you think about it lol.
        >	If you scroll down I’m literally being downvoted for saying the Nazi’s were bad because of genocide.


Yeah…that’s not why you’re being downvoted.
            Honestly, why then?  He was being a bit...strong headed, but that seemed to be the main point he was making.

Because he is completely ignoring that Andrew Ryan had a shitty personality in addition to shitty philosophy, and shitty actions.

Edit: plus the whole defending Hitler bit.
                    Well, I think you're missing their point.  He's not saying that Andrew Ryan has a good personality, or ignoring that it's bad...he's saying that it's not a good reason *on its own* to dislike his politics.   It's basically an ad hominem argument.

Andrew Ryan could have a great personality and we would still disagree with their politics.  A hypothetical person may be a complete asshole, but I might still like their politics (see the current "lesser of two evils" state of US politics).

The question is just...why do we need to talk about his personality at all when discussing their politics?

Also, where did he defend Hitler...?

I firmly believe Ryan’s personality fueled his actions, and it bears discussion. His stubbornness, his pride, his lack of empathy, and his greed all fed into his decision to build Rapture, his choice of government style, and his ineptitude in dealing with Fontaine. 

No, someone’s personality doesn’t always merit a discussion. Sometimes it even detracts from the discussion. That is not the case when it comes to Andrew Ryan. 

>	Also, where did he defend Hitler…?

Alright, I’ll admit I misinterpreted one their comments.
                            Ah, now I understand you. Yes, I would agree with all of your points then :) Sorry to drag this on for so long, but thanks for humoring me.
You’re making it seem like Andrew Ryan is an actual sentient being and not pixels.
I dont agree with ryans ideas, but even then why is this post being disliked? Ideas are ideas no matter who came up with them
>	An asshole can say something that’s a good idea. Or a kind person can say something that’s a bad idea. You shouldn’t use Andrew Ryan’s personality to judge his ideas.


You should judge people based on their personality traits *and* their actions. In addition to being an egotistical asshole  Andrew Ryan did not have a single redeeming action in the entirety of the Bioshock franchise. From the word “go,” his actions and ideology were remarkably bad.
Okay dude I get what you’re going for but prob not the best example to die on the hill for 💀

Well the idea as it is written isn't terrible. It's just that right above it is a giant venerating bronze bust of his own head sneering down at the humbled observer. Rather defeats the whole slogan.
Because it's propaganda?
This guy built an entire city based on his own very personal ideals.

Rapture was a literal social and political fly-trap, bring all these ideologists and entrepreneurs here and see what they do given a incredibly loose and unregulated system.

Honestly, the fact he has his genetic family able to heal for free while the rest cannot should speak volumes about Rapture policy / corruption.
I mean, that's literally the anarchist moto, but he added men. Which in and of itself breaks the whole ordeal și c e it just replaces the oppressive role of a god and a king and gives it to men. Which isn't what anarchism is about
Yeah but right wing libertarians have been appropriating the language of anarchists from the start, even going so far as to call themselves anarcho capitalists. It's just buzzwords coming from him
agreed!! andrew ryan had the right idea but went about it the complete wrong way. like completely the wrong way lol
Very accurate. With respect of property rights or contracts (at least initially at its start), very Anacap.
Ryan had one good idea.
Agreed. I'm very much on the side of marx in this debate 😅
    I mean Marx isn't that wrong.....
        Did you play the second Bioshock?
            Lamb is more a collectivist cult than analogous to communism in the text. She espouses something closer to a religious commune than the economic system of communism as she's still at the top of a hierarchy while the people don't really control anything. Ryan represents Randian objectivism and capitalism, but Lamb doesn't represent Communism, just a radical collectivism that sacrifices the individual.
                That’s what communism is, though. The root word of communism is “commune” which refers to a collectivist society
                    because root words = definition
                        Yes. Words mean what they mean. That’s why root words exist. That’s how you know “hydrotherapy” means “water therapy” or how you know “Annual” is derived from the Latin Anno meaning year or how Dominion and Dominance both come from the Latin Dominus meaning Lord
                            “Words mean what they mean”

Yeah, and what they mean is not tied to the letters that form them. This is such a strange argument to make considering there are hundreds of words whose meanings differ than their roots. Especially for a word like communism which comes from a word meaning “for the community” and not “a collectivist society” or whatever you just pulled out of thin air.

Edit: literally in your own example, you say two words that come from “the lord” and yet have nothing to do with it now. You don’t seem to grasp how language works.
                "a radical collectivism that sacrifices the individual" Yeah communism
                    Marxism is deliberately anarchistic and rejects both hierarchy and statism. Lamb, by definition, is not a Marxist. Maybe, *maybe* a commentary on Stalinism's authoritarian collectivism and cult of personality, but certainly not in any way a valid critique of actual Marxism.

                    I'm literally taking a class on the soviet union, and WWI

The soviet union devolped large amounts of Human rights under the rule of Bolchevic. It was the first time women had complete equality. It wasn't until he died and Stalin came in power that the soviet union became a mess.
                        Wonder how many women scholars would agree that women had complete equality in soviet russia.
                            They did specify "before Stalin" which is fair enough.  During Stalin's rule and ever since after, Russia has been a human rights nightmare I don't think anyone would deny that.
                            Original values were that people were people.
                        yeah , and that's exactly the point. communism became a mess because it doesn't work. people will always mess it.
                            Communism under an authoritarian government will never work because it’s an oppressive system. We’ve yet to see an example of democratic communism
I miscalculated and used 1969 instead of 1960. Here are the prices adjusting for inflation in USD assuming that's the standard Rapture goes by. Source [here](https://www.in2013dollars.com/)

$16 would be $160.44

$20 would be $200.55  


Edit: At a wage of $15 for a 7.5 hour day you'd make $112.5 gross pay
    Damn thats like half my income. Like Actually lol.
        Here in Canada that's minimum wage, even counting for inflation that price for a medkit or health station is substantially lower than American healthcare and treatment would be practically instantaneous as opposed to taking time off of work and losing money in the process.
Consider the fact that manufacturers of medkits could charge whatever they want if it's lucrative, and for a full restoration of even near fatal injuries within seconds that price is still insanely low compared to a doctor. IRL something like that would fetch thousands of dollars a shot, if you're working a low paying job that's dangerous you can't afford a doctor OR missing days or weeks of work while recovering so one of these could mean the difference between getting back to work or losing your home and job. The point of  the matter is that medkits and health stations even when adjusted for inflation would still be incredibly cheap, I'll look up what stitches and a broken arm will cost in America without health insurance.  


For patients without health insurance, stitches typically cost $200-$3,000 or more, depending on the provider, the injury and the complexity of the repair.  


Without health insurance, surgical treatment of a broken arm typically costs $16,000 or more.

As I've said even if the medkit cost 4X the amount ($802.20 adjusted for inflation in USD) it would still be incredibly cheap compared to your average medical bill. If I was making $15 an hour it would take about a week to pay off a medkit instead of months or years of my income. At its regular price that would take 13.37 hours of work to pay for a medkit, I still don't see the point you're trying to make here.
    > medkits could charge whatever they want if it's lucrative

consider 2 companies competing in Rapture

now the 'price' is relative to actual expenses with a sufficient profit

they never said its a monopoly (to the contrary actually)
        It could cost $2-$5 to make one, still a good profit for only $20. You sound like you just want to argue even though I've provided sufficient data to back up my opinion.
            Have you missed what I said about competition ?

DO you understand what happens to prices when companies compete for customers?

And as I said before  : this is a vending machine price (middleman + overhead  involved) .   A shop price in NORMAL Rapture could easily be half your $20.

Post Chaos Rapture when money is nearly worthless and being found on the ground - it doesnt even make sense that all the machines are NOT EMPTY (if Raptures in as bad a state as the writers want to make the situation ). 

.
                I'm referring to medkits in competition with doctors and normal medical treatment, I made it abundantly clear that I was in each response. If you're still not seeing the point I can't help you any further.
                    yes and if the kits work very well the doctors dont have much to do and likely move on to do things the kits cant do

more complicated operations.therapies would likely still require manual applications (including ADAM)

we are talking about costs of medi-kits not doctor treatments

$20 in a vending machine ...

you think a shop in NORMAL Rapture has it for the same price ?

if you can easily buy it in a shop then you dont in a machine 

machines aspect is being convenient which in our world people are willing to pay the premium price for (or the machines wouldnt exist)
                        A quote from the first thing I said here.

"...it would have revolutionized healthcare for such a low price as to have put doctors out of business aside from specialists and top surgeons. Your average GP would be screwed with health stations in very convenient locations..."

You're literally repeating what I said earlier while making baseless speculations on prices, and to my knowledge there was only one company making medkits to begin with. I feel like you're intentionally trying to argue at this point so I won't bother responding to you anymore, you're going in circles at this point.

Yep. That’s u/premer777 for you. They look at Rapture and say “hey, this is a good idea. That Andrew Ryan is a pretty swell fellow.” 

Welcome to the wonderful world of Ryan fanboys.
                            except Im trying to get thru to you that your $20 price out of a machine may : during a chaos world dystopia  ISNT THE SAME as when its in  NORMAL Rapture and when sold in shops (and with likely multiple manufacturers) .

you seem to be the one going off on tangents irrelevant to that point

>	At least it won’t put me in debt for simply living

No. It would deny you service, and then you die. At least the US medical system doesn’t do that if you’re too poor to pay. 

Do you ever wonder if there were homeless in Rapture? Do you ever wonder if Rapture citizens had to pay for air? It’s an enclosed bubble, after all, in an ecosystem hostile to human life. Air is a service that must be produced, and therefore most likely paid for. What happens to someone if they can’t pay?
Rapture is a perfect example of why the blind pursuit of capital is a bad a idea.
It was doomed from the start as it's inspiration Galt's Gulch was.
It’s a game, not a real life scenario. All of the ideas are hypothetical there, just like in Infinite, as we didn’t try anything near those systems.
Or make the rich pay
Exactly the gripe me and a lot of other people have. You don't think about it much but there are a ton of aspects of our lives we straight-up don't get to have a choice in because we are fundamentally forced to engage in the system.
    Yeah I mean capitalism is based off exploitation so it makes sense
        Precisely. A pity saying so is oft considered getting too political.

(Even though being political is the whole point of Bioshock, but I'd digress.)
            If we can't talk about politics in a political Game what's the point
It is. Andrew Ryan is actually a traditionalist at heart. That’s why he named Big Daddies Big Daddy.

Okay when yaron brook says the game isn't objectivist or correctly says her ideas idk why you're bringing ayn rand into this. Yes they based ryan off John galt but it hardly means you can drag in ayn rand to justify your point when the game misrepresents so many of her ideas. 
Also ayn rand would hardly every utter the phrase "petty mortality" so don't throw her into this. 
Even on top of that I meant he never accounted for a sociopathic grifter who was willing to do anything and everything for his own sake or any of the psychos of rapture. He was so laizze Faire he literally forgot basic ethics.
    you will have to spell out which of the ayn rand ideas you say the game misrepresents

Ive already said many times before that the writers had to create a dystopia and so conflictingly/contradictorally avoided significant elements of  objectivism/libertarianism  - like a (competing) free press what would have instantly denounced Fontaine as a seller of poison (the insanity and disfigurement/cancer), thus ending/nullifying his story role of becoming an industrial  mogul to rival Ryan.

He accounted for miscreants and had security to take care of that if not also an operational system of constables to handle such things.

And again (once informed) the sociopathic grifter would be quickly done away with in a society which is supposed to empower the citizens.  Rapture was a small place that he could not run from the reaction the population would have to his criminal behavior.

.
        Okay fair enough, firstly the issue is a large amount of half ideas. Essentially ayn rand had her philosophy as an integrated whole, meaning to agree with one is to agree with all of it and inturn rand herself. 
So firstly, one example I have already given you, ayn rand would not ever approve of a society that discounts morality and props up uninhibited behavior as much as ryan does. For instance in the rapture novel two grocery store owners are competing, but one owns essentially the market for the whole of the area garbage, charging his competitor double to drive his grocery store out of business. Ryan ignored this and basically said tough luck, instead of rand which would encourage the community not to indulge in such unethical behavior as to drive out competition through a corporatist tactic. 
Another is that rand would never support or allow any form of government nationalization or possession as ryan industries took fontaines company after the revolt. Rand would never consider that anything but unethical and completely against her ideas of laizze Faire, even with the revolution. Essentially she would clearly see it as wrong for any form of state to claim ownership of a company. 
Another is that there is room for ethics, rand would vomit at the idea of anything involving the violations of medical ethics or even the countless issues of the little sisters, considering she viewed such things as being antithetical to a moral society. 
I can go on but if you want to learn more Read ayn rand and the virtuous egoist. That book outlines a large idea of her beliefs but ultimately will tell you how differently she viewed the world from andrew ryan. It's a corruption of objectivist ideas to have all the epistemology and poltics, but none of the complete ethics.

Edit Apologies it seems I talked past you. Yes ideally that would be an idea in objectivism, however it would not be an idea that ryan would allow atleast as far as the characters actions would say. But I will say andrew ryan is not an objectivist by any stretch and moe the anarchocapitlist from hell,lol.
            ayn rand is not the 'end all and be all' of Objectivism.

> that discounts morality and props up uninhibited behavior as much as ryan does. 


What does he prop up ?  And use examples of what was in original pre-kashmir rapture and not in the chaos rapture where society had already disintegrated  and Ryan is in emergency/war mode.

Consider that Fontaines crimes were done in secret -- indicating it was NOT freely allowed or accepted or 'uninhibited'.

The writers hardly allowed any action by the populace as they needed that easy dystopia story 

Also the author of the  'rapture novel' has  just ups the stuff in the game (again I assert its post chaos an dNOT normal Rapture)  as most takes place before the chaos begins and he needs all the action to spice up the book.

I've elsewhere explained where the Grocery store guy story is bosh because it ignores so ***MANY*** possible alternates the victim had to to the abusive neighbor short of shooting him. The common neighborhood mechanism were completely ignored (just pay a kid to haul your trash guy ...) The author had to simpleton-style prop up the 'dystopia'  (perhaps didn't want to contradict the games similar pattern of ignorance).  Seriously  Its like these people HADNT operated in the mean world of the surface before they got to rapture.  

The nationalized Fontaine Futuistsics is similar 'baaaad ryan'  smear.   The addicts needed ADAM, Fontaines assets would have been used for reparations to his victims and the 3 1/2 month period this happen (before the terrorist chaos began) didnt allow any story of what was to be done in a more complete plan.

So really its the writers who needing their 'easy' story for a slaughter-fest dystopia, ignored basics of objectivism/libertarianism and carelessly contrive a storyline with its 'hate ryan' mantra to cover for that midgame 'plot twist'  (and no Choice  to NOT follow the sociopath atlas - not giving their twist  away to the player) 

I can say this because the writers are inconsistent and have things so contradictory to what they say Rapture operated (and what the world in general operates through).

.

You’ve mentioned this idea of Ryan using Fontaine Futuristics as reparations. It was hilarious then and hilarious now. What evidence can you provide fron *any* of Andrew Ryan’s words or actions would ***ever*** give you the idea that he would use the assets for reparations? What evidence can you provide fron *any* of Andrew Ryan’s words or actions would ***ever*** even attempt to consider paying reparations? 

What evidence can you provide fron *any* of Andrew Ryan’s words or actions that indicated Ryan even had a plan to fix Adam? An inkling of an idea that he would try to fix Adam? 

>	contrive a storyline with its ‘hate ryan’ mantra to cover for that midgame ‘plot twist’  (and no Choice  to NOT follow the sociopath atlas - not giving their twist  away to the player)

Did you miss the part where it was Andrew Ryan demanding Jack kill him? Ryan was there. Ryan was in full control. Ryan could have ordered Jack away, could have conceivably ordered Jack to kill Atlas. Instead, he decided to pick up his toys and go home. Ryan decided to blow up his city, and order his son to brutally beat him to death, and even turned off his private vita chamber so Ryan wouldn’t be reborn. 

>	I can say this because the writers are inconsistent and have things so contradictory to what they say Rapture operated

You’ve claimed this before, but have never once been able to back it up. What was inconsistent about the writing of Bioshock? What was contradictory in the plot? I’m eagerly awaiting an example.
                    cant help you if you have no understanding about how things work.

your simpleton arguments are always 'it was never said in the game' 

and my reply is that the game if full of gaps and vagaries where much which HAD TO BE THERE  was never mentioned.

I pulled out specific things to address because you claim they’re in character. Show me the evidence. 

I’m still waiting for an example of a contradiction, fyi.

Rapture *did* have a competitive free press. There were multiple news papers, including Ryan’s own Rapture Tribune, in addition to a number of magazines and novels. 

There are no known headlines about Adam side effects. There is one about Adam shortages due to the war. 

You paint this hyper idealized version of the press and frankly capitalism as a whole, which is *not* grounded in reality. It’s certainly not grounded in the reality of the “Pre-FDR” US that you’ve insisted on multiple times. Things like bribery and intimidation of journalists were and continue to be a thing.

Edit. Meanwhile, we even have an example of a journalist who accepted bribes not to report on Adam: Stanely Poole.
            

'Free Press' that misses the whole  INSANITY, DEFORMATION CANCERY STUFF with ADAM  - conveniently until Ryan is now able to be blamed for it is my simple argument --- with the Game Writers playing with the  story details to make them fit their BLAME RYAN plot.

So the Writers inconsistency about an ACTUALLY WORKING  Free Press is not really there for that one VERY IMPORTANT game explanation.

-

You might want to review what I was referencing about Pre-Wilson/FDR as to the less regulated capitalism in the US.  If you don't know what I am talking about, you have a huge gap in your understanding of US History.

Andrew Ryan *isn’t* blamed for the side effects. There *are* no newspaper headlines about Adam side effects, period. 

What Ryan *is* blamed for is his inaction towards Adam. 

>	So the Writers inconsistency about an ACTUALLY WORKING  Free Press is not really there for that one VERY IMPORTANT game explanation.

As a reminder, “free press” means free from government intervention and government censorship. It doesn’t mean “always perusing the truth in the name of the best interest of the people.” 

For example, the US has free press. The US’s press coverage of certain events can be extremely disappointing.

Interestingly enough, Andrew Ryan actually kills the free press in Rapture. He orders all publications to cease, and places a lock down on the PA system. 

>	You might want to review what I was referencing about Pre-Wilson/FDR as to the less regulated capitalism in the US.  If you don’t know what I am talking about, you have a huge gap in your understanding of US History.

It’s like you’ve never heard of price fixing, captive markets, company towns, monopolies, etc. Do you understand *why* the Progressive Era happened in the US? Hint: Unregulated capitalism which resulted in widespread abuses of workers and consumers. Oh, hey, and let’s not forget child labor in factories, and mines. 

People who ~~live in glass houses~~ don’t know what free press and price fixing are shouldn’t throw throw stones.

Totalitarian is pogging
they had elections ?

it was never described

most of the authoritarian things you saw was done after there was a 'civil war' with a bunch of splicer terrorists tearing up the city and endangering everyones survival
    The elections happened before the war and can be found mentions in the audio files of the game
>	Your right when the rapture council stoped elections

There were no elections in Rapture. 

>	The only thing Ryan did wrong was […] to run the city in a authoritarian fashion.

Talk about burying the lede.
    A propaganda playlet in BioShock 2 Multiplayer mentions that the elections to choose new members for the city council were postponed several times in the months leading up to the Rapture Civil War. So yeah they did
        >	A propaganda playlet in BioShock 2 Multiplayer mentions that the elections to choose new members for the city council were postponed several times in the months leading up to the Rapture Civil War. So yeah they did

Interesting. I never played the multiplayer. 

Fascinating that the playlet is the only direct mention of elections.
            I mean they only show glimpses of pre civil war the main game is set in a post civil war and in anarchy so its not the main focus. Also bill McDonagh mentions elections in an audio diary but is a blink and you miss it thing

Not really. The audio diaries make it abundantly clear all was not well in Zion prior to the Civil War.

        Try waiting times in the UK
    Tell that to every specialist I have to wait 5-6 months to see but still have to pay $500 with insurance for treatments.
    Tbh the UK has a mixed system, NHS providing public healthcare and private healthcare providers like Bupa or AXA etc. And we have one of the most shitty, underfunded healthcare systems in Europe. Miles better than the US, but still the shit one compared to other countries that have public healthcare. Fact is private companies can very easily sway policy, it's what happened with our rail service, our postal service and what corporate politicians like the entirety of the conservative party and the majority of labour end up doing to every public service. Private options for what should be public services open the door for corporate meddling until there's no good option left

https://publichealth.choate.edu/across-the-pond-a-comparison-of-healthcare-systems-in-the-us-and-uk/

American healthcare system has unparalleled responsiveness, with an emergency wait room time of merely 58 minutes as opposed to Britain's three hours…

Financially though, the US system is broken af.
            This is a misreading of my point. I'm not claiming that the UK has better wait times than the US, I'm saying that it surpasses the IS in accessibility. Sure we have longer wait times, mostly for things that aren't life threatening triage is always necessary when there's a high enough volume of patients, the thing is it still far outpaces the US in one very important regard. The wait times in America may be shorter, but this only applies if you can afford to pay. It's inevitable that the US would have shorter wait times because all too often people can't afford to be treated in the first place. I should have made it clear that I was comparing the UK to the rest of Europe with regard to wait times and quality of care etc and not the us because America doesn't share the most basic requirement of medical care: that people are actually able to get it. Also even in the quality of care department I'd say the UK pulls ahead because there isn't the same prevalence of over prescription of opioids leading to a national crisis of addiction in the UK as in the US.

Tldr UK still vastly outpaces US in medical care because it's accessible and not the source of an opioid crisis.
                Hummm. This seems to be a completely new point you are making now, so I’m not sure how it’s a misreading of your original point. 

Your original points were (1) that the UK has a mixed system, (2) the UK health system is shitty and underfunded (But “miles better than. The US”), (3) private companies sway policy, and (perhaps) destroy “every public service”. 

I appreciate your brand spanking new accessibility argument. 

I didn’t really make an argument. My point was to show a couple articles to rebut your original sub-point, that is, that the UK system is “miles better than the US system”.  With respect to accessibility, I agree with you. But there are many metrics in which the US system is far better than the UK system. I don’t really care either way.
                    Yeah I didn't specify how the UK has a better system than the US, I assumed it was clear that I could be talking about any number of things. It's not that it's a new point, I just wasn't being too specific about it. Sure the other metrics may exist, but they in no way make up for the glaring flaws with the American system, but again that's just something I wasn't specific enough on is all
                        Agreed, though. The US system is shit. :-)
Because I'm wrong?
    It's literally not wrong.
Correct, you should judge the Nazi’s by the fact they literally genocided millions of people. Not because their leader was an asshole.
    But that goes against what you just said
        No, it doesn’t. I said the personality traits of someone doesn’t matter when assessing that person’s ideas. What made the Nazi’s bad is that they wanted to exterminate an entire race of people. Not that their leader was an asshole.
            But the entire beginning and main reason for the nazi's to start doing what they did is because hitler was a asshole who hated jews,  and he manipulated the people into starting this entire hatred because of the poor conditions Germany was left in after ww1 from the treaty of Versailles
                So if someone were to ask you why Nazism is bad you think “because Hitler was mean” would be a stronger argument than “because they believed in murdering millions of innocent people”?
                    It doesn't matter about stronger arguments, it matters because the nazis believed in murdering millions of innocents and that hitler was a dickhead who started it all because he was butthurt. Anyways why are you arguing history on a bioshock subreddit? No one cares.
                        You’re literally the one who brought it up. 

And I’m debating this because summarizing Rapture’s demise as “well Andrew Ryan was an asshole” is doing an extreme disservice to Ken Levine and the immense effort put into the game around historical and political commentary. The ideas of this game go way deeper than that.
                        Because like fucking 200 of you dipshits completely missed this random person's point, and I just accidentally stumbled in this thread. 

I don't even really play Bioshock. I played the first one like 10 years ago, it was cool but this little thread managed to piss me off. It’s just so dumb to witness. This is a microcosm of the apparent dumbing down of society in favor of tumorous circle jerks of people desperate for validation.
                Alright.

Hitler hated animal abuse. Is abusing animals good?
                    >	Alright.

>	Hitler hated animal abuse. Is abusing animals good?

Of course not. Hitler had a few positive philosophies, such as his stance on animal cruelty and vegetarianism. Hitler *also* had far more negative philosophies. His ridiculous, almost comically evil philosophies, ideals, and actions drown out the little positive about him. 

Hitler being anti-animal cruelty doesn’t magically make animal cruelty good and doesn’t magically make Hitler good.
                        **Which was exactly the dude's point.**

Why did you all gang up on him like he was an asshole who was wrong? This literally was his point.

If I stay on Reddit too long, I swear I'm gonna get a fucking hemmorhage.
    But...that....that's their point
How do Ayn Rand's ideas kill people and enrich sociopaths?
    Actively forsaking altruism, the idea that people are useless parasites unless they're profitable in all things, the very idea that men like Ryan are in any way self-made, a lack of any commitment to the common good or society, scorn for any form of regulation, seeing social safety nets as a bad thing, and I could go on and on. 

Rand refined the capitalist/libertarian ethos into a modern idealogy that espouses profit and selfish objectivism over compassion and base humanity. Which empowers sociopaths who believe in the myth of infinite growth and treat people like numbers to wreak havoc on the world and stack the deck in their favor against the people who make them their money. Hell, Rapture is a direct reference to Galt's Gulch, the wonderland Rand envisioned in Atlas Shrugged where all the rich ass hats go after literally nuking the means of production so the "parasitic" poor can't benefit from their absence.
        What a gish-gallop of an argument. 

>Actively forsaking altruism

My guess is you're using this term in a different way than Rand does. I'm guessing you mean it to be simple charity. Rand means it as complete self-sacrifice to the needs of others.

> idea that people are useless parasites unless they're profitable in all things

Where does Rand say this?

>the very idea that men like Ryan are in any way self-made

How aren't they?

>a lack of any commitment to the common good or society

What's a common good?

I'd venture if I asked a Christian what the common good is they'd say for everyone to be a Christian and serve their fellow Christians. I'd venture a guess that you would not consider this to be "common good". I'd further venture the Christian would disagree with what you consider "the common good".

>scorn for any form of regulation

The free market actively provides regulation without government intervention.

>seeing social safety nets as a bad thing

Social safety nets aren't a bad thing. It's government involvement in them and compulsion to pay into them that are the bad things in objectivism.

>and I could go on and on

Bring it on.

>Rand refined the capitalist/libertarian ethos into a modern idealogy that espouses profit and selfish objectivism over compassion and base humanity.

Profit, you mean what's gained by both members to a voluntary transaction?

"Selfish", there's nothing wrong with rational self-interest.

Compassion, again, what's compassion and how is Rand against it?

Base humanity, ah yes, truly serving humanity is holding a gun to someone's head and making them pay for things for others.

>who believe in the myth of infinite growth

Define the myth of infinite growth and describe how it's a myth.

>treat people like numbers

How does Rand's philosophy lead people to treat others like numbers?

>wreak havoc on the world

How does Rand's philosophy lead people to wreak havoc on the world?

> stack the deck in their favor against the people who make them their money

How does Rand's philosophy lead people to stack the deck in their favor against the people who make them their money?

>Rand envisioned in Atlas Shrugged where all the rich ass hats go after literally nuking the means of production so the "parasitic" poor can't benefit from their absence.

Why is anyone entitled to the innovation, mind, or labor of another?
            1. Rand means it in the sense of any societal safety net or sacrificing self-interest in the slightest. Her "heroes" are all self-serving ass hats who embody the myth of the self-made man ignoring that their workers and society as a whole enabled made the making of that money. In addition, she seems to ascribe to the “Great Man” theory of history which is just flat-out wrong.

2. Have you read Atlas Shrugged? It’s full of her macho business Daddies going on and on about how there are two types of people in the world, comparing most people to parasites. Not to mention the whole train tunnel sequence where she gleefully recounts thousands of people dying or the terrorist working for Galt that blows up the means of production so the “parasite” workers can’t seize them.

3. I’m glad you asked, men like Ryan, and their modern-day counterparts, are built by investments made into society itself, public infrastructure which they exploit, and being utter sociopaths to accumulate power and wealth. Ryan only got to where he was because of a lack of regulation, luck, and a cutthroat attitude that allowed him to become a modern-day robber baron literally burning down forests to stop them from being nationalized. 

4. I don’t know, clean drinking water and food, public roads and highways to allow freedom of movement for both economic and personal reasons, robust public programs that help people improve themselves and their situation instead of letting poverty consume them while the well to do live off their labor. Public health via regulation on pollutants/food safety/health care, and personal protections for marginalized groups and labor rights. All the things men like Ryan hate because it’s harder to control your workers when they have their basic needs met.

5.  The fuck it does. Insulin, a vital drug that’s so easy to make it was patented for $2, is hundreds of times more expensive in the US because the Pharma companies can charge it. Rivers were literally lighting on fire before regulation forced the companies dumping chemicals to stop. Company stores, industrial rape in mining communities, and child laborers were all major common issues across the US before the labor movement fought for and won protections under the law. The Free Market regulates itself about as much as a child with a plate of cookies does, they will always do all they can to make as much money as possible, no matter the personal or environmental cost. Hell, look out your window at the looming climate crisis, oil companies knew all about Climate Change going as far back as the fifties, but goose-stepped their way into it anyway, all for profit. If you honestly believe the free market regulates itself, you’re incredibly naive.

6. States (in the national sense), municipalities, and communities are the only entities capable of running a social safety net, and taxpayers paying into those social safety nets are always a net gain if they’re robust enough to actually improve people’s lives. Relying on a private option or charity does not work, under Reagan, he used the myth of the welfare queen to cut social program spending which led to an almost unprecedented increase in food insecurity while his complete stonewalling of aid for the AIDS crisis killed thousands of people. When the richest, most powerful government on earth focuses more on toppling democratically elected governments in South America, pouring billions into defense contractors' coffers, and the myth of trickle-down economics people die. The New Deal, while being capitalism’s last saving grace before an inevitable worker’s revolt, saved this country and millions of people were uplifted out of poverty because of it. Excuse me if I don’t trust the robber barons who want to go back to a time before it.

7. “Rational self-interest” has always been code for “I don’t think everyone deserves their basic needs met because I like the power it gives me”. And in the world Rand espouses, and Rapture demonstrates it’s not so much voluntary when one or two assholes can take over an entire industry/niche and then price gouge the fuck out of everyone. Profit is a drug that’s going to kill us all, a desire for profit led a fucking fruit company to use the CIA to coup a democratically elected leader because he wanted his country to control their fruit orchards, and profit led to Oil companies knowingly walking us into a climate disaster that could end all life as we know it, profit led to a mother deciding how long she can starve herself so her child can get the medicine they need to live. Living in a truly functioning and just society means investing in that society, taxes are part of that considering you use roads, sewers, and all the numerous programs that make your life as safe as can be (I.E the fire department, the FDA keeping you from eating poison or fake food, and the EPA keeping your water safe to drink ETC.) That’s compassion, paying into the system so that you and your fellow man can live in a society where they won’t be written off because they fell through the cracks, Rand is a hypocrite (died on government assistance gladly) and the mother of the worst aspect of Capitalist thought.

8. Look at the stock market, look at every company that demands growth year over year while still making insane amounts of profit. Taking and taking while all the while reducing what they’re actually offering and doing all they can to escape liability for their mistakes. Look at the Sacklers who fed the opioid crisis to grow their business exponentially year after year or the price of life-saving drugs (mostly paid for by federal taxpayer money) just to make even more insane profit, look at oil companies who killed every step towards a cleaner future and are fixing/overcharging for their products to make record profits while the world slips into climate coma. Capitalism demands infinite growth to please shareholders who have no idea what the real world is, and in that infinite growth myth, it aspires to its highest form. A cancer cell strangling the rest of humanity.

9. When all of your concern is your own self-interest, profits, and a disregard for safety or regulation of any kind the people actually generating that wealth become just another number. Look at how labor in this country treated people, especially women and children, in the gilded age and company town era. Children often worked in factories losing fingers and limbs on an industrial scale, and in the hay day of the company town, industrial-scale rape was practically institutionalized so sick or wounded men wouldn’t be thrown out on the street. This naturally leads to the red lining and Robert Moses’ active destruction of any chance for walkable cities in America and the advent of sealing off entire communities to die because they were poor and or POC. 

10. Lack of regulation (Climate change, mass exploitation of marginalized groups, health crises like the ones that saw the formation of the FDA) leads to death, sickness, and exploitation on a societal scale. Not to mention that Rand’s objectivism philosophy lends itself well to colonialism and imperialism just with a capitalist “Great man” theory bent.

11. See 10. because unregulated capitalists will do all they can to give themselves more power and money while stripping any chance of mobility from the workforce that makes them their money. Otherwise known as the “fuck you got mine” attitude that people like Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and every “self-made” man espouses.

12. Because they didn’t build it, workers did. Engineers, researchers, laborers, and everyone else who had a hand in the creation, innovation, and growth of the organization. If Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk alone could make a billion dollars without the thousands of people minimum it took to make it, then by all means do it, but in reality, they aren’t the gods amongst men that Rand paints men like them as. They’re just good at exploiting people, our toxic capitalist system, and making the cold calls that accrue the money they didn’t earn. Ryan didn’t build Rapture, Musk didn’t create Space X’s rockets or even found Tesla, and Bezos got extremely lucky and had nearly half a million dollars from his folks to create Amazon. If they alone had twenty dollars and a can-do attitude they’d die in the gutter like the rest of us. 

TL;DR: You missed the point of Bioshock because it touches on every fucking point I did. If you want to read about Rand's business daddies and fucking fountain heads, then by all means do, just don't base your world view on it.
It’s classic group think. Whenever people see a downvoted post they want to downvote it themselves to feel like they’re part of the in group, without really thinking much about wrong or right. 

If you scroll down I’m literally being downvoted for saying the Nazi’s were bad because of genocide. People don’t think about it, they just want to be part of the group. 

Quite ironic when you think about it lol.
    >	If you scroll down I’m literally being downvoted for saying the Nazi’s were bad because of genocide.


Yeah…that’s not why you’re being downvoted.
        Honestly, why then?  He was being a bit...strong headed, but that seemed to be the main point he was making.
            >	Honestly, why then?  He was being a bit…strong headed, but that seemed to be the main point he was making.

Because he is completely ignoring that Andrew Ryan had a shitty personality in addition to shitty philosophy, and shitty actions.

Edit: plus the whole defending Hitler bit.
                Well, I think you're missing their point.  He's not saying that Andrew Ryan has a good personality, or ignoring that it's bad...he's saying that it's not a good reason *on its own* to dislike his politics.   It's basically an ad hominem argument.

Andrew Ryan could have a great personality and we would still disagree with their politics.  A hypothetical person may be a complete asshole, but I might still like their politics (see the current "lesser of two evils" state of US politics).

The question is just...why do we need to talk about his personality at all when discussing their politics?

Also, where did he defend Hitler...?

>	The question is just…why do we need to talk about his personality at all when discussing their politics?

I firmly believe Ryan’s personality fueled his actions, and it bears discussion. His stubbornness, his pride, his lack of empathy, and his greed all fed into his decision to build Rapture, his choice of government style, and his ineptitude in dealing with Fontaine. 

No, someone’s personality doesn’t always merit a discussion. Sometimes it even detracts from the discussion. That is not the case when it comes to Andrew Ryan. 

>	Also, where did he defend Hitler…?

Alright, I’ll admit I misinterpreted one their comments.
                        Ah, now I understand you. Yes, I would agree with all of your points then :) Sorry to drag this on for so long, but thanks for humoring me.
I’m never going to apologize and delete a post that’s objectively correct.
I mean Marx isn't that wrong.....
    Did you play the second Bioshock?
        Lamb is more a collectivist cult than analogous to communism in the text. She espouses something closer to a religious commune than the economic system of communism as she's still at the top of a hierarchy while the people don't really control anything. Ryan represents Randian objectivism and capitalism, but Lamb doesn't represent Communism, just a radical collectivism that sacrifices the individual.
            That’s what communism is, though. The root word of communism is “commune” which refers to a collectivist society
                because root words = definition
                    Yes. Words mean what they mean. That’s why root words exist. That’s how you know “hydrotherapy” means “water therapy” or how you know “Annual” is derived from the Latin Anno meaning year or how Dominion and Dominance both come from the Latin Dominus meaning Lord
                        “Words mean what they mean”

Yeah, and what they mean is not tied to the letters that form them. This is such a strange argument to make considering there are hundreds of words whose meanings differ than their roots. Especially for a word like communism which comes from a word meaning “for the community” and not “a collectivist society” or whatever you just pulled out of thin air.

Edit: literally in your own example, you say two words that come from “the lord” and yet have nothing to do with it now. You don’t seem to grasp how language works.
            "a radical collectivism that sacrifices the individual" Yeah communism
                Marxism is deliberately anarchistic and rejects both hierarchy and statism. Lamb, by definition, is not a Marxist. Maybe, *maybe* a commentary on Stalinism's authoritarian collectivism and cult of personality, but certainly not in any way a valid critique of actual Marxism.
    [deleted]
        Marx actually contributed alot to the devolpment and reform to human rights. Much like the early soviet union
            [deleted]
                You do realise that’s how education works, right? No one is born knowing information
                I'm literally taking a class on the soviet union, and WWI

The soviet union devolped large amounts of Human rights under the rule of Bolchevic. It was the first time women had complete equality. It wasn't until he died and Stalin came in power that the soviet union became a mess.
                    Wonder how many women scholars would agree that women had complete equality in soviet russia.
                        They did specify "before Stalin" which is fair enough.  During Stalin's rule and ever since after, Russia has been a human rights nightmare I don't think anyone would deny that.
                        Original values were that people were people.
                    yeah , and that's exactly the point. communism became a mess because it doesn't work. people will always mess it.
                        Communism under an authoritarian government will never work because it’s an oppressive system. We’ve yet to see an example of democratic communism
Damn thats like half my income. Like Actually lol.
    Here in Canada that's minimum wage, even counting for inflation that price for a medkit or health station is substantially lower than American healthcare and treatment would be practically instantaneous as opposed to taking time off of work and losing money in the process.
> medkits could charge whatever they want if it's lucrative

consider 2 companies competing in Rapture

now the 'price' is relative to actual expenses with a sufficient profit

they never said its a monopoly (to the contrary actually)
    It could cost $2-$5 to make one, still a good profit for only $20. You sound like you just want to argue even though I've provided sufficient data to back up my opinion.
        Have you missed what I said about competition ?

DO you understand what happens to prices when companies compete for customers?

And as I said before  : this is a vending machine price (middleman + overhead  involved) .   A shop price in NORMAL Rapture could easily be half your $20.

Post Chaos Rapture when money is nearly worthless and being found on the ground - it doesnt even make sense that all the machines are NOT EMPTY (if Raptures in as bad a state as the writers want to make the situation ). 

.
            I'm referring to medkits in competition with doctors and normal medical treatment, I made it abundantly clear that I was in each response. If you're still not seeing the point I can't help you any further.
                yes and if the kits work very well the doctors dont have much to do and likely move on to do things the kits cant do

more complicated operations.therapies would likely still require manual applications (including ADAM)

we are talking about costs of medi-kits not doctor treatments

$20 in a vending machine ...

you think a shop in NORMAL Rapture has it for the same price ?

if you can easily buy it in a shop then you dont in a machine 

machines aspect is being convenient which in our world people are willing to pay the premium price for (or the machines wouldnt exist)
                    A quote from the first thing I said here.

"...it would have revolutionized healthcare for such a low price as to have put doctors out of business aside from specialists and top surgeons. Your average GP would be screwed with health stations in very convenient locations..."

You're literally repeating what I said earlier while making baseless speculations on prices, and to my knowledge there was only one company making medkits to begin with. I feel like you're intentionally trying to argue at this point so I won't bother responding to you anymore, you're going in circles at this point.
                        >	You’re literally repeating what I said earlier while making baseless speculations on prices, and to my knowledge there was only one company making medkits to begin with.

Yep. That’s u/premer777 for you. They look at Rapture and say “hey, this is a good idea. That Andrew Ryan is a pretty swell fellow.” 

Welcome to the wonderful world of Ryan fanboys.
                        except Im trying to get thru to you that your $20 price out of a machine may : during a chaos world dystopia  ISNT THE SAME as when its in  NORMAL Rapture and when sold in shops (and with likely multiple manufacturers) .

you seem to be the one going off on tangents irrelevant to that point

Yeah I mean capitalism is based off exploitation so it makes sense
    Precisely. A pity saying so is oft considered getting too political.

(Even though being political is the whole point of Bioshock, but I'd digress.)

            I wouldn't have picked something that didn't have merit to frolic and grow

I'm a shitposter with meaning
you will have to spell out which of the ayn rand ideas you say the game misrepresents

Ive already said many times before that the writers had to create a dystopia and so conflictingly/contradictorally avoided significant elements of  objectivism/libertarianism  - like a (competing) free press what would have instantly denounced Fontaine as a seller of poison (the insanity and disfigurement/cancer), thus ending/nullifying his story role of becoming an industrial  mogul to rival Ryan.

He accounted for miscreants and had security to take care of that if not also an operational system of constables to handle such things.

And again (once informed) the sociopathic grifter would be quickly done away with in a society which is supposed to empower the citizens.  Rapture was a small place that he could not run from the reaction the population would have to his criminal behavior.

.
    Okay fair enough, firstly the issue is a large amount of half ideas. Essentially ayn rand had her philosophy as an integrated whole, meaning to agree with one is to agree with all of it and inturn rand herself. 
So firstly, one example I have already given you, ayn rand would not ever approve of a society that discounts morality and props up uninhibited behavior as much as ryan does. For instance in the rapture novel two grocery store owners are competing, but one owns essentially the market for the whole of the area garbage, charging his competitor double to drive his grocery store out of business. Ryan ignored this and basically said tough luck, instead of rand which would encourage the community not to indulge in such unethical behavior as to drive out competition through a corporatist tactic. 
Another is that rand would never support or allow any form of government nationalization or possession as ryan industries took fontaines company after the revolt. Rand would never consider that anything but unethical and completely against her ideas of laizze Faire, even with the revolution. Essentially she would clearly see it as wrong for any form of state to claim ownership of a company. 
Another is that there is room for ethics, rand would vomit at the idea of anything involving the violations of medical ethics or even the countless issues of the little sisters, considering she viewed such things as being antithetical to a moral society. 
I can go on but if you want to learn more Read ayn rand and the virtuous egoist. That book outlines a large idea of her beliefs but ultimately will tell you how differently she viewed the world from andrew ryan. It's a corruption of objectivist ideas to have all the epistemology and poltics, but none of the complete ethics.

Edit Apologies it seems I talked past you. Yes ideally that would be an idea in objectivism, however it would not be an idea that ryan would allow atleast as far as the characters actions would say. But I will say andrew ryan is not an objectivist by any stretch and moe the anarchocapitlist from hell,lol.
        ayn rand is not the 'end all and be all' of Objectivism.

> that discounts morality and props up uninhibited behavior as much as ryan does. 


What does he prop up ?  And use examples of what was in original pre-kashmir rapture and not in the chaos rapture where society had already disintegrated  and Ryan is in emergency/war mode.

Consider that Fontaines crimes were done in secret -- indicating it was NOT freely allowed or accepted or 'uninhibited'.

The writers hardly allowed any action by the populace as they needed that easy dystopia story 

Also the author of the  'rapture novel' has  just ups the stuff in the game (again I assert its post chaos an dNOT normal Rapture)  as most takes place before the chaos begins and he needs all the action to spice up the book.

I've elsewhere explained where the Grocery store guy story is bosh because it ignores so ***MANY*** possible alternates the victim had to to the abusive neighbor short of shooting him. The common neighborhood mechanism were completely ignored (just pay a kid to haul your trash guy ...) The author had to simpleton-style prop up the 'dystopia'  (perhaps didn't want to contradict the games similar pattern of ignorance).  Seriously  Its like these people HADNT operated in the mean world of the surface before they got to rapture.  

The nationalized Fontaine Futuistsics is similar 'baaaad ryan'  smear.   The addicts needed ADAM, Fontaines assets would have been used for reparations to his victims and the 3 1/2 month period this happen (before the terrorist chaos began) didnt allow any story of what was to be done in a more complete plan.

So really its the writers who needing their 'easy' story for a slaughter-fest dystopia, ignored basics of objectivism/libertarianism and carelessly contrive a storyline with its 'hate ryan' mantra to cover for that midgame 'plot twist'  (and no Choice  to NOT follow the sociopath atlas - not giving their twist  away to the player) 

I can say this because the writers are inconsistent and have things so contradictory to what they say Rapture operated (and what the world in general operates through).

You’ve mentioned this idea of Ryan using Fontaine Futuristics as reparations. It was hilarious then and hilarious now. What evidence can you provide fron *any* of Andrew Ryan’s words or actions would ***ever*** give you the idea that he would use the assets for reparations? What evidence can you provide fron *any* of Andrew Ryan’s words or actions would ***ever*** even attempt to consider paying reparations? 

What evidence can you provide fron *any* of Andrew Ryan’s words or actions that indicated Ryan even had a plan to fix Adam? An inkling of an idea that he would try to fix Adam? 

>	contrive a storyline with its ‘hate ryan’ mantra to cover for that midgame ‘plot twist’  (and no Choice  to NOT follow the sociopath atlas - not giving their twist  away to the player)

Did you miss the part where it was Andrew Ryan demanding Jack kill him? Ryan was there. Ryan was in full control. Ryan could have ordered Jack away, could have conceivably ordered Jack to kill Atlas. Instead, he decided to pick up his toys and go home. Ryan decided to blow up his city, and order his son to brutally beat him to death, and even turned off his private vita chamber so Ryan wouldn’t be reborn. 

>	I can say this because the writers are inconsistent and have things so contradictory to what they say Rapture operated

You’ve claimed this before, but have never once been able to back it up. What was inconsistent about the writing of Bioshock? What was contradictory in the plot? I’m eagerly awaiting an example.
                cant help you if you have no understanding about how things work.

your simpleton arguments are always 'it was never said in the game' 

and my reply is that the game if full of gaps and vagaries where much which HAD TO BE THERE  was never mentioned.

Insults without any kind of evidence. Classic u/premer777.

I pulled out specific things to address because you claim they’re in character. Show me the evidence. 

I’m still waiting for an example of a contradiction, fyi.
    >	 like a (competing) free press what would have instantly denounced Fontaine as a seller of poison (the insanity and disfigurement/cancer), thus ending/nullifying his story role of becoming an industrial  mogul to rival Ryan.

Rapture *did* have a competitive free press. There were multiple news papers, including Ryan’s own Rapture Tribune, in addition to a number of magazines and novels. 

There are no known headlines about Adam side effects. There is one about Adam shortages due to the war. 

You paint this hyper idealized version of the press and frankly capitalism as a whole, which is *not* grounded in reality. It’s certainly not grounded in the reality of the “Pre-FDR” US that you’ve insisted on multiple times. Things like bribery and intimidation of journalists were and continue to be a thing.

Edit. Meanwhile, we even have an example of a journalist who accepted bribes not to report on Adam: Stanely Poole.
        

'Free Press' that misses the whole  INSANITY, DEFORMATION CANCERY STUFF with ADAM  - conveniently until Ryan is now able to be blamed for it is my simple argument --- with the Game Writers playing with the  story details to make them fit their BLAME RYAN plot.

So the Writers inconsistency about an ACTUALLY WORKING  Free Press is not really there for that one VERY IMPORTANT game explanation.

You might want to review what I was referencing about Pre-Wilson/FDR as to the less regulated capitalism in the US.  If you don't know what I am talking about, you have a huge gap in your understanding of US History.

Andrew Ryan *isn’t* blamed for the side effects. There *are* no newspaper headlines about Adam side effects, period. 

What Ryan *is* blamed for is his inaction towards Adam. 

>	So the Writers inconsistency about an ACTUALLY WORKING  Free Press is not really there for that one VERY IMPORTANT game explanation.

As a reminder, “free press” means free from government intervention and government censorship. It doesn’t mean “always perusing the truth in the name of the best interest of the people.” 

For example, the US has free press. The US’s press coverage of certain events can be extremely disappointing.

Interestingly enough, Andrew Ryan actually kills the free press in Rapture. He orders all publications to cease, and places a lock down on the PA system. 

>	You might want to review what I was referencing about Pre-Wilson/FDR as to the less regulated capitalism in the US.  If you don’t know what I am talking about, you have a huge gap in your understanding of US History.

It’s like you’ve never heard of price fixing, captive markets, company towns, monopolies, etc. Do you understand *why* the Progressive Era happened in the US? Hint: Unregulated capitalism which resulted in widespread abuses of workers and consumers. Oh, hey, and let’s not forget child labor in factories, and mines. 

People who ~~live in glass houses~~ don’t know what free press and price fixing are shouldn’t throw throw stones.

Yeah discussions like this have no right answer
    You have sparked up a good discussion though!
        I know I've been playing both sides of it and it's fun
Yeah and one that crossed Comments to be angry at me in another.
The elections happened before the war and can be found mentions in the audio files of the game
A propaganda playlet in BioShock 2 Multiplayer mentions that the elections to choose new members for the city council were postponed several times in the months leading up to the Rapture Civil War. So yeah they did
    >	A propaganda playlet in BioShock 2 Multiplayer mentions that the elections to choose new members for the city council were postponed several times in the months leading up to the Rapture Civil War. So yeah they did

Interesting. I never played the multiplayer. 

Fascinating that the playlet is the only direct mention of elections.
        I mean they only show glimpses of pre civil war the main game is set in a post civil war and in anarchy so its not the main focus. Also bill McDonagh mentions elections in an audio diary but is a blink and you miss it thing
            >	I mean they only show glimpses of pre civil war the main game is set in a post civil war and in anarchy so its not the main focus.

Not really. The audio diaries make it abundantly clear all was not well in Zion prior to the Civil War.

Wtf? This bullshit has been debunked over and over
Wrong and Loud
The average wait times in the US beg to differ
    Try waiting times in the UK
Tell that to every specialist I have to wait 5-6 months to see but still have to pay $500 with insurance for treatments.
Tbh the UK has a mixed system, NHS providing public healthcare and private healthcare providers like Bupa or AXA etc. And we have one of the most shitty, underfunded healthcare systems in Europe. Miles better than the US, but still the shit one compared to other countries that have public healthcare. Fact is private companies can very easily sway policy, it's what happened with our rail service, our postal service and what corporate politicians like the entirety of the conservative party and the majority of labour end up doing to every public service. Private options for what should be public services open the door for corporate meddling until there's no good option left

https://publichealth.choate.edu/across-the-pond-a-comparison-of-healthcare-systems-in-the-us-and-uk/

American healthcare system has unparalleled responsiveness, with an emergency wait room time of merely 58 minutes as opposed to Britain's three hours…

Financially though, the US system is broken af.
        This is a misreading of my point. I'm not claiming that the UK has better wait times than the US, I'm saying that it surpasses the IS in accessibility. Sure we have longer wait times, mostly for things that aren't life threatening triage is always necessary when there's a high enough volume of patients, the thing is it still far outpaces the US in one very important regard. The wait times in America may be shorter, but this only applies if you can afford to pay. It's inevitable that the US would have shorter wait times because all too often people can't afford to be treated in the first place. I should have made it clear that I was comparing the UK to the rest of Europe with regard to wait times and quality of care etc and not the us because America doesn't share the most basic requirement of medical care: that people are actually able to get it. Also even in the quality of care department I'd say the UK pulls ahead because there isn't the same prevalence of over prescription of opioids leading to a national crisis of addiction in the UK as in the US.

Tldr UK still vastly outpaces US in medical care because it's accessible and not the source of an opioid crisis.
            Hummm. This seems to be a completely new point you are making now, so I’m not sure how it’s a misreading of your original point. 

Your original points were (1) that the UK has a mixed system, (2) the UK health system is shitty and underfunded (But “miles better than. The US”), (3) private companies sway policy, and (perhaps) destroy “every public service”. 

I appreciate your brand spanking new accessibility argument. 

I didn’t really make an argument. My point was to show a couple articles to rebut your original sub-point, that is, that the UK system is “miles better than the US system”.  With respect to accessibility, I agree with you. But there are many metrics in which the US system is far better than the UK system. I don’t really care either way.
                Yeah I didn't specify how the UK has a better system than the US, I assumed it was clear that I could be talking about any number of things. It's not that it's a new point, I just wasn't being too specific about it. Sure the other metrics may exist, but they in no way make up for the glaring flaws with the American system, but again that's just something I wasn't specific enough on is all
                    Agreed, though. The US system is shit. :-)
It's literally not wrong.
But that goes against what you just said
    No, it doesn’t. I said the personality traits of someone doesn’t matter when assessing that person’s ideas. What made the Nazi’s bad is that they wanted to exterminate an entire race of people. Not that their leader was an asshole.
        But the entire beginning and main reason for the nazi's to start doing what they did is because hitler was a asshole who hated jews,  and he manipulated the people into starting this entire hatred because of the poor conditions Germany was left in after ww1 from the treaty of Versailles
            So if someone were to ask you why Nazism is bad you think “because Hitler was mean” would be a stronger argument than “because they believed in murdering millions of innocent people”?
                It doesn't matter about stronger arguments, it matters because the nazis believed in murdering millions of innocents and that hitler was a dickhead who started it all because he was butthurt. Anyways why are you arguing history on a bioshock subreddit? No one cares.
                    You’re literally the one who brought it up. 

And I’m debating this because summarizing Rapture’s demise as “well Andrew Ryan was an asshole” is doing an extreme disservice to Ken Levine and the immense effort put into the game around historical and political commentary. The ideas of this game go way deeper than that.
                    Because like fucking 200 of you dipshits completely missed this random person's point, and I just accidentally stumbled in this thread. 

I don't even really play Bioshock. I played the first one like 10 years ago, it was cool but this little thread managed to piss me off. It’s just so dumb to witness. This is a microcosm of the apparent dumbing down of society in favor of tumorous circle jerks of people desperate for validation.
            Alright.

Hitler hated animal abuse. Is abusing animals good?
                >	Alright.

>	Hitler hated animal abuse. Is abusing animals good?

Of course not. Hitler had a few positive philosophies, such as his stance on animal cruelty and vegetarianism. Hitler *also* had far more negative philosophies. His ridiculous, almost comically evil philosophies, ideals, and actions drown out the little positive about him. 

Hitler being anti-animal cruelty doesn’t magically make animal cruelty good and doesn’t magically make Hitler good.
                    **Which was exactly the dude's point.**

Why did you all gang up on him like he was an asshole who was wrong? This literally was his point.

If I stay on Reddit too long, I swear I'm gonna get a fucking hemmorhage.
But...that....that's their point
Actively forsaking altruism, the idea that people are useless parasites unless they're profitable in all things, the very idea that men like Ryan are in any way self-made, a lack of any commitment to the common good or society, scorn for any form of regulation, seeing social safety nets as a bad thing, and I could go on and on. 

Rand refined the capitalist/libertarian ethos into a modern idealogy that espouses profit and selfish objectivism over compassion and base humanity. Which empowers sociopaths who believe in the myth of infinite growth and treat people like numbers to wreak havoc on the world and stack the deck in their favor against the people who make them their money. Hell, Rapture is a direct reference to Galt's Gulch, the wonderland Rand envisioned in Atlas Shrugged where all the rich ass hats go after literally nuking the means of production so the "parasitic" poor can't benefit from their absence.
    What a gish-gallop of an argument. 

>Actively forsaking altruism

My guess is you're using this term in a different way than Rand does. I'm guessing you mean it to be simple charity. Rand means it as complete self-sacrifice to the needs of others.

> idea that people are useless parasites unless they're profitable in all things

Where does Rand say this?

>the very idea that men like Ryan are in any way self-made

How aren't they?

>a lack of any commitment to the common good or society

What's a common good?

I'd venture if I asked a Christian what the common good is they'd say for everyone to be a Christian and serve their fellow Christians. I'd venture a guess that you would not consider this to be "common good". I'd further venture the Christian would disagree with what you consider "the common good".

>scorn for any form of regulation

The free market actively provides regulation without government intervention.

>seeing social safety nets as a bad thing

Social safety nets aren't a bad thing. It's government involvement in them and compulsion to pay into them that are the bad things in objectivism.

>and I could go on and on

Bring it on.

>Rand refined the capitalist/libertarian ethos into a modern idealogy that espouses profit and selfish objectivism over compassion and base humanity.

Profit, you mean what's gained by both members to a voluntary transaction?

"Selfish", there's nothing wrong with rational self-interest.

Compassion, again, what's compassion and how is Rand against it?

Base humanity, ah yes, truly serving humanity is holding a gun to someone's head and making them pay for things for others.

>who believe in the myth of infinite growth

Define the myth of infinite growth and describe how it's a myth.

>treat people like numbers

How does Rand's philosophy lead people to treat others like numbers?

>wreak havoc on the world

How does Rand's philosophy lead people to wreak havoc on the world?

> stack the deck in their favor against the people who make them their money

How does Rand's philosophy lead people to stack the deck in their favor against the people who make them their money?

>Rand envisioned in Atlas Shrugged where all the rich ass hats go after literally nuking the means of production so the "parasitic" poor can't benefit from their absence.

Why is anyone entitled to the innovation, mind, or labor of another?
        1. Rand means it in the sense of any societal safety net or sacrificing self-interest in the slightest. Her "heroes" are all self-serving ass hats who embody the myth of the self-made man ignoring that their workers and society as a whole enabled made the making of that money. In addition, she seems to ascribe to the “Great Man” theory of history which is just flat-out wrong.

2. Have you read Atlas Shrugged? It’s full of her macho business Daddies going on and on about how there are two types of people in the world, comparing most people to parasites. Not to mention the whole train tunnel sequence where she gleefully recounts thousands of people dying or the terrorist working for Galt that blows up the means of production so the “parasite” workers can’t seize them.

3. I’m glad you asked, men like Ryan, and their modern-day counterparts, are built by investments made into society itself, public infrastructure which they exploit, and being utter sociopaths to accumulate power and wealth. Ryan only got to where he was because of a lack of regulation, luck, and a cutthroat attitude that allowed him to become a modern-day robber baron literally burning down forests to stop them from being nationalized. 

4. I don’t know, clean drinking water and food, public roads and highways to allow freedom of movement for both economic and personal reasons, robust public programs that help people improve themselves and their situation instead of letting poverty consume them while the well to do live off their labor. Public health via regulation on pollutants/food safety/health care, and personal protections for marginalized groups and labor rights. All the things men like Ryan hate because it’s harder to control your workers when they have their basic needs met.

5.  The fuck it does. Insulin, a vital drug that’s so easy to make it was patented for $2, is hundreds of times more expensive in the US because the Pharma companies can charge it. Rivers were literally lighting on fire before regulation forced the companies dumping chemicals to stop. Company stores, industrial rape in mining communities, and child laborers were all major common issues across the US before the labor movement fought for and won protections under the law. The Free Market regulates itself about as much as a child with a plate of cookies does, they will always do all they can to make as much money as possible, no matter the personal or environmental cost. Hell, look out your window at the looming climate crisis, oil companies knew all about Climate Change going as far back as the fifties, but goose-stepped their way into it anyway, all for profit. If you honestly believe the free market regulates itself, you’re incredibly naive.

6. States (in the national sense), municipalities, and communities are the only entities capable of running a social safety net, and taxpayers paying into those social safety nets are always a net gain if they’re robust enough to actually improve people’s lives. Relying on a private option or charity does not work, under Reagan, he used the myth of the welfare queen to cut social program spending which led to an almost unprecedented increase in food insecurity while his complete stonewalling of aid for the AIDS crisis killed thousands of people. When the richest, most powerful government on earth focuses more on toppling democratically elected governments in South America, pouring billions into defense contractors' coffers, and the myth of trickle-down economics people die. The New Deal, while being capitalism’s last saving grace before an inevitable worker’s revolt, saved this country and millions of people were uplifted out of poverty because of it. Excuse me if I don’t trust the robber barons who want to go back to a time before it.

7. “Rational self-interest” has always been code for “I don’t think everyone deserves their basic needs met because I like the power it gives me”. And in the world Rand espouses, and Rapture demonstrates it’s not so much voluntary when one or two assholes can take over an entire industry/niche and then price gouge the fuck out of everyone. Profit is a drug that’s going to kill us all, a desire for profit led a fucking fruit company to use the CIA to coup a democratically elected leader because he wanted his country to control their fruit orchards, and profit led to Oil companies knowingly walking us into a climate disaster that could end all life as we know it, profit led to a mother deciding how long she can starve herself so her child can get the medicine they need to live. Living in a truly functioning and just society means investing in that society, taxes are part of that considering you use roads, sewers, and all the numerous programs that make your life as safe as can be (I.E the fire department, the FDA keeping you from eating poison or fake food, and the EPA keeping your water safe to drink ETC.) That’s compassion, paying into the system so that you and your fellow man can live in a society where they won’t be written off because they fell through the cracks, Rand is a hypocrite (died on government assistance gladly) and the mother of the worst aspect of Capitalist thought.

8. Look at the stock market, look at every company that demands growth year over year while still making insane amounts of profit. Taking and taking while all the while reducing what they’re actually offering and doing all they can to escape liability for their mistakes. Look at the Sacklers who fed the opioid crisis to grow their business exponentially year after year or the price of life-saving drugs (mostly paid for by federal taxpayer money) just to make even more insane profit, look at oil companies who killed every step towards a cleaner future and are fixing/overcharging for their products to make record profits while the world slips into climate coma. Capitalism demands infinite growth to please shareholders who have no idea what the real world is, and in that infinite growth myth, it aspires to its highest form. A cancer cell strangling the rest of humanity.

9. When all of your concern is your own self-interest, profits, and a disregard for safety or regulation of any kind the people actually generating that wealth become just another number. Look at how labor in this country treated people, especially women and children, in the gilded age and company town era. Children often worked in factories losing fingers and limbs on an industrial scale, and in the hay day of the company town, industrial-scale rape was practically institutionalized so sick or wounded men wouldn’t be thrown out on the street. This naturally leads to the red lining and Robert Moses’ active destruction of any chance for walkable cities in America and the advent of sealing off entire communities to die because they were poor and or POC. 

10. Lack of regulation (Climate change, mass exploitation of marginalized groups, health crises like the ones that saw the formation of the FDA) leads to death, sickness, and exploitation on a societal scale. Not to mention that Rand’s objectivism philosophy lends itself well to colonialism and imperialism just with a capitalist “Great man” theory bent.

11. See 10. because unregulated capitalists will do all they can to give themselves more power and money while stripping any chance of mobility from the workforce that makes them their money. Otherwise known as the “fuck you got mine” attitude that people like Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and every “self-made” man espouses.

12. Because they didn’t build it, workers did. Engineers, researchers, laborers, and everyone else who had a hand in the creation, innovation, and growth of the organization. If Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk alone could make a billion dollars without the thousands of people minimum it took to make it, then by all means do it, but in reality, they aren’t the gods amongst men that Rand paints men like them as. They’re just good at exploiting people, our toxic capitalist system, and making the cold calls that accrue the money they didn’t earn. Ryan didn’t build Rapture, Musk didn’t create Space X’s rockets or even found Tesla, and Bezos got extremely lucky and had nearly half a million dollars from his folks to create Amazon. If they alone had twenty dollars and a can-do attitude they’d die in the gutter like the rest of us. 

TL;DR: You missed the point of Bioshock because it touches on every fucking point I did. If you want to read about Rand's business daddies and fucking fountain heads, then by all means do, just don't base your world view on it.

        >	Honestly, why then?  He was being a bit…strong headed, but that seemed to be the main point he was making.

Because he is completely ignoring that Andrew Ryan had a shitty personality in addition to shitty philosophy, and shitty actions.

Edit: plus the whole defending Hitler bit.
            Well, I think you're missing their point.  He's not saying that Andrew Ryan has a good personality, or ignoring that it's bad...he's saying that it's not a good reason *on its own* to dislike his politics.   It's basically an ad hominem argument.

Andrew Ryan could have a great personality and we would still disagree with their politics.  A hypothetical person may be a complete asshole, but I might still like their politics (see the current "lesser of two evils" state of US politics).

The question is just...why do we need to talk about his personality at all when discussing their politics?

Also, where did he defend Hitler...?

>	The question is just…why do we need to talk about his personality at all when discussing their politics?

I firmly believe Ryan’s personality fueled his actions, and it bears discussion. His stubbornness, his pride, his lack of empathy, and his greed all fed into his decision to build Rapture, his choice of government style, and his ineptitude in dealing with Fontaine. 

No, someone’s personality doesn’t always merit a discussion. Sometimes it even detracts from the discussion. That is not the case when it comes to Andrew Ryan. 

>	Also, where did he defend Hitler…?

Alright, I’ll admit I misinterpreted one their comments.
                    Ah, now I understand you. Yes, I would agree with all of your points then :) Sorry to drag this on for so long, but thanks for humoring me.
Did you play the second Bioshock?
    Lamb is more a collectivist cult than analogous to communism in the text. She espouses something closer to a religious commune than the economic system of communism as she's still at the top of a hierarchy while the people don't really control anything. Ryan represents Randian objectivism and capitalism, but Lamb doesn't represent Communism, just a radical collectivism that sacrifices the individual.
        That’s what communism is, though. The root word of communism is “commune” which refers to a collectivist society
            because root words = definition
                Yes. Words mean what they mean. That’s why root words exist. That’s how you know “hydrotherapy” means “water therapy” or how you know “Annual” is derived from the Latin Anno meaning year or how Dominion and Dominance both come from the Latin Dominus meaning Lord
                    “Words mean what they mean”

Yeah, and what they mean is not tied to the letters that form them. This is such a strange argument to make considering there are hundreds of words whose meanings differ than their roots. Especially for a word like communism which comes from a word meaning “for the community” and not “a collectivist society” or whatever you just pulled out of thin air.

Edit: literally in your own example, you say two words that come from “the lord” and yet have nothing to do with it now. You don’t seem to grasp how language works.
        "a radical collectivism that sacrifices the individual" Yeah communism
            Marxism is deliberately anarchistic and rejects both hierarchy and statism. Lamb, by definition, is not a Marxist. Maybe, *maybe* a commentary on Stalinism's authoritarian collectivism and cult of personality, but certainly not in any way a valid critique of actual Marxism.
[deleted]
    Marx actually contributed alot to the devolpment and reform to human rights. Much like the early soviet union
        [deleted]
            You do realise that’s how education works, right? No one is born knowing information
            I'm literally taking a class on the soviet union, and WWI

The soviet union devolped large amounts of Human rights under the rule of Bolchevic. It was the first time women had complete equality. It wasn't until he died and Stalin came in power that the soviet union became a mess.
                Wonder how many women scholars would agree that women had complete equality in soviet russia.
                    They did specify "before Stalin" which is fair enough.  During Stalin's rule and ever since after, Russia has been a human rights nightmare I don't think anyone would deny that.
                    Original values were that people were people.
                yeah , and that's exactly the point. communism became a mess because it doesn't work. people will always mess it.
                    Communism under an authoritarian government will never work because it’s an oppressive system. We’ve yet to see an example of democratic communism
Here in Canada that's minimum wage, even counting for inflation that price for a medkit or health station is substantially lower than American healthcare and treatment would be practically instantaneous as opposed to taking time off of work and losing money in the process.
It could cost $2-$5 to make one, still a good profit for only $20. You sound like you just want to argue even though I've provided sufficient data to back up my opinion.
    Have you missed what I said about competition ?

DO you understand what happens to prices when companies compete for customers?

And as I said before  : this is a vending machine price (middleman + overhead  involved) .   A shop price in NORMAL Rapture could easily be half your $20.

Post Chaos Rapture when money is nearly worthless and being found on the ground - it doesnt even make sense that all the machines are NOT EMPTY (if Raptures in as bad a state as the writers want to make the situation ). 

.
        I'm referring to medkits in competition with doctors and normal medical treatment, I made it abundantly clear that I was in each response. If you're still not seeing the point I can't help you any further.
            yes and if the kits work very well the doctors dont have much to do and likely move on to do things the kits cant do

more complicated operations.therapies would likely still require manual applications (including ADAM)

we are talking about costs of medi-kits not doctor treatments

$20 in a vending machine ...

you think a shop in NORMAL Rapture has it for the same price ?

if you can easily buy it in a shop then you dont in a machine 

machines aspect is being convenient which in our world people are willing to pay the premium price for (or the machines wouldnt exist)
                A quote from the first thing I said here.

"...it would have revolutionized healthcare for such a low price as to have put doctors out of business aside from specialists and top surgeons. Your average GP would be screwed with health stations in very convenient locations..."

You're literally repeating what I said earlier while making baseless speculations on prices, and to my knowledge there was only one company making medkits to begin with. I feel like you're intentionally trying to argue at this point so I won't bother responding to you anymore, you're going in circles at this point.

Yep. That’s u/premer777 for you. They look at Rapture and say “hey, this is a good idea. That Andrew Ryan is a pretty swell fellow.” 

Welcome to the wonderful world of Ryan fanboys.
                    except Im trying to get thru to you that your $20 price out of a machine may : during a chaos world dystopia  ISNT THE SAME as when its in  NORMAL Rapture and when sold in shops (and with likely multiple manufacturers) .

you seem to be the one going off on tangents irrelevant to that point

Precisely. A pity saying so is oft considered getting too political.

(Even though being political is the whole point of Bioshock, but I'd digress.)
    If we can't talk about politics in a political Game what's the point

        I wouldn't have picked something that didn't have merit to frolic and grow

I'm a shitposter with meaning
Okay fair enough, firstly the issue is a large amount of half ideas. Essentially ayn rand had her philosophy as an integrated whole, meaning to agree with one is to agree with all of it and inturn rand herself. 
So firstly, one example I have already given you, ayn rand would not ever approve of a society that discounts morality and props up uninhibited behavior as much as ryan does. For instance in the rapture novel two grocery store owners are competing, but one owns essentially the market for the whole of the area garbage, charging his competitor double to drive his grocery store out of business. Ryan ignored this and basically said tough luck, instead of rand which would encourage the community not to indulge in such unethical behavior as to drive out competition through a corporatist tactic. 
Another is that rand would never support or allow any form of government nationalization or possession as ryan industries took fontaines company after the revolt. Rand would never consider that anything but unethical and completely against her ideas of laizze Faire, even with the revolution. Essentially she would clearly see it as wrong for any form of state to claim ownership of a company. 
Another is that there is room for ethics, rand would vomit at the idea of anything involving the violations of medical ethics or even the countless issues of the little sisters, considering she viewed such things as being antithetical to a moral society. 
I can go on but if you want to learn more Read ayn rand and the virtuous egoist. That book outlines a large idea of her beliefs but ultimately will tell you how differently she viewed the world from andrew ryan. It's a corruption of objectivist ideas to have all the epistemology and poltics, but none of the complete ethics.

Edit Apologies it seems I talked past you. Yes ideally that would be an idea in objectivism, however it would not be an idea that ryan would allow atleast as far as the characters actions would say. But I will say andrew ryan is not an objectivist by any stretch and moe the anarchocapitlist from hell,lol.
    ayn rand is not the 'end all and be all' of Objectivism.

> that discounts morality and props up uninhibited behavior as much as ryan does. 


What does he prop up ?  And use examples of what was in original pre-kashmir rapture and not in the chaos rapture where society had already disintegrated  and Ryan is in emergency/war mode.

Consider that Fontaines crimes were done in secret -- indicating it was NOT freely allowed or accepted or 'uninhibited'.

The writers hardly allowed any action by the populace as they needed that easy dystopia story 

Also the author of the  'rapture novel' has  just ups the stuff in the game (again I assert its post chaos an dNOT normal Rapture)  as most takes place before the chaos begins and he needs all the action to spice up the book.

I've elsewhere explained where the Grocery store guy story is bosh because it ignores so ***MANY*** possible alternates the victim had to to the abusive neighbor short of shooting him. The common neighborhood mechanism were completely ignored (just pay a kid to haul your trash guy ...) The author had to simpleton-style prop up the 'dystopia'  (perhaps didn't want to contradict the games similar pattern of ignorance).  Seriously  Its like these people HADNT operated in the mean world of the surface before they got to rapture.  

The nationalized Fontaine Futuistsics is similar 'baaaad ryan'  smear.   The addicts needed ADAM, Fontaines assets would have been used for reparations to his victims and the 3 1/2 month period this happen (before the terrorist chaos began) didnt allow any story of what was to be done in a more complete plan.

So really its the writers who needing their 'easy' story for a slaughter-fest dystopia, ignored basics of objectivism/libertarianism and carelessly contrive a storyline with its 'hate ryan' mantra to cover for that midgame 'plot twist'  (and no Choice  to NOT follow the sociopath atlas - not giving their twist  away to the player) 

I can say this because the writers are inconsistent and have things so contradictory to what they say Rapture operated (and what the world in general operates through).

You’ve mentioned this idea of Ryan using Fontaine Futuristics as reparations. It was hilarious then and hilarious now. What evidence can you provide fron *any* of Andrew Ryan’s words or actions would ***ever*** give you the idea that he would use the assets for reparations? What evidence can you provide fron *any* of Andrew Ryan’s words or actions would ***ever*** even attempt to consider paying reparations? 

What evidence can you provide fron *any* of Andrew Ryan’s words or actions that indicated Ryan even had a plan to fix Adam? An inkling of an idea that he would try to fix Adam? 

>	contrive a storyline with its ‘hate ryan’ mantra to cover for that midgame ‘plot twist’  (and no Choice  to NOT follow the sociopath atlas - not giving their twist  away to the player)

Did you miss the part where it was Andrew Ryan demanding Jack kill him? Ryan was there. Ryan was in full control. Ryan could have ordered Jack away, could have conceivably ordered Jack to kill Atlas. Instead, he decided to pick up his toys and go home. Ryan decided to blow up his city, and order his son to brutally beat him to death, and even turned off his private vita chamber so Ryan wouldn’t be reborn. 

>	I can say this because the writers are inconsistent and have things so contradictory to what they say Rapture operated

You’ve claimed this before, but have never once been able to back it up. What was inconsistent about the writing of Bioshock? What was contradictory in the plot? I’m eagerly awaiting an example.
            cant help you if you have no understanding about how things work.

your simpleton arguments are always 'it was never said in the game' 

and my reply is that the game if full of gaps and vagaries where much which HAD TO BE THERE  was never mentioned.

Insults without any kind of evidence. Classic u/premer777. 

>	and my reply is that the game if full of gaps and vagaries where much which HAD TO BE THERE  was never mentioned.

I pulled out specific things to address because you claim they’re in character. Show me the evidence. 

I’m still waiting for an example of a contradiction, fyi.
>	 like a (competing) free press what would have instantly denounced Fontaine as a seller of poison (the insanity and disfigurement/cancer), thus ending/nullifying his story role of becoming an industrial  mogul to rival Ryan.

Rapture *did* have a competitive free press. There were multiple news papers, including Ryan’s own Rapture Tribune, in addition to a number of magazines and novels. 

There are no known headlines about Adam side effects. There is one about Adam shortages due to the war. 

You paint this hyper idealized version of the press and frankly capitalism as a whole, which is *not* grounded in reality. It’s certainly not grounded in the reality of the “Pre-FDR” US that you’ve insisted on multiple times. Things like bribery and intimidation of journalists were and continue to be a thing.

Edit. Meanwhile, we even have an example of a journalist who accepted bribes not to report on Adam: Stanely Poole.
    

'Free Press' that misses the whole  INSANITY, DEFORMATION CANCERY STUFF with ADAM  - conveniently until Ryan is now able to be blamed for it is my simple argument --- with the Game Writers playing with the  story details to make them fit their BLAME RYAN plot.

So the Writers inconsistency about an ACTUALLY WORKING  Free Press is not really there for that one VERY IMPORTANT game explanation.

-

You might want to review what I was referencing about Pre-Wilson/FDR as to the less regulated capitalism in the US.  If you don't know what I am talking about, you have a huge gap in your understanding of US History.

Andrew Ryan *isn’t* blamed for the side effects. There *are* no newspaper headlines about Adam side effects, period. 

What Ryan *is* blamed for is his inaction towards Adam. 

>	So the Writers inconsistency about an ACTUALLY WORKING  Free Press is not really there for that one VERY IMPORTANT game explanation.

As a reminder, “free press” means free from government intervention and government censorship. It doesn’t mean “always perusing the truth in the name of the best interest of the people.” 

For example, the US has free press. The US’s press coverage of certain events can be extremely disappointing.

Interestingly enough, Andrew Ryan actually kills the free press in Rapture. He orders all publications to cease, and places a lock down on the PA system. 

>	You might want to review what I was referencing about Pre-Wilson/FDR as to the less regulated capitalism in the US.  If you don’t know what I am talking about, you have a huge gap in your understanding of US History.

It’s like you’ve never heard of price fixing, captive markets, company towns, monopolies, etc. Do you understand *why* the Progressive Era happened in the US? Hint: Unregulated capitalism which resulted in widespread abuses of workers and consumers. Oh, hey, and let’s not forget child labor in factories, and mines. 

People who ~~live in glass houses~~ don’t know what free press and price fixing are shouldn’t throw throw stones.

You have sparked up a good discussion though!

>	A propaganda playlet in BioShock 2 Multiplayer mentions that the elections to choose new members for the city council were postponed several times in the months leading up to the Rapture Civil War. So yeah they did

Interesting. I never played the multiplayer. 

Fascinating that the playlet is the only direct mention of elections.
    I mean they only show glimpses of pre civil war the main game is set in a post civil war and in anarchy so its not the main focus. Also bill McDonagh mentions elections in an audio diary but is a blink and you miss it thing

Not really. The audio diaries make it abundantly clear all was not well in Zion prior to the Civil War.
Try waiting times in the UK

https://publichealth.choate.edu/across-the-pond-a-comparison-of-healthcare-systems-in-the-us-and-uk/

American healthcare system has unparalleled responsiveness, with an emergency wait room time of merely 58 minutes as opposed to Britain's three hours…

Financially though, the US system is broken af.
    This is a misreading of my point. I'm not claiming that the UK has better wait times than the US, I'm saying that it surpasses the IS in accessibility. Sure we have longer wait times, mostly for things that aren't life threatening triage is always necessary when there's a high enough volume of patients, the thing is it still far outpaces the US in one very important regard. The wait times in America may be shorter, but this only applies if you can afford to pay. It's inevitable that the US would have shorter wait times because all too often people can't afford to be treated in the first place. I should have made it clear that I was comparing the UK to the rest of Europe with regard to wait times and quality of care etc and not the us because America doesn't share the most basic requirement of medical care: that people are actually able to get it. Also even in the quality of care department I'd say the UK pulls ahead because there isn't the same prevalence of over prescription of opioids leading to a national crisis of addiction in the UK as in the US.

Tldr UK still vastly outpaces US in medical care because it's accessible and not the source of an opioid crisis.
        Hummm. This seems to be a completely new point you are making now, so I’m not sure how it’s a misreading of your original point. 

Your original points were (1) that the UK has a mixed system, (2) the UK health system is shitty and underfunded (But “miles better than. The US”), (3) private companies sway policy, and (perhaps) destroy “every public service”. 

I appreciate your brand spanking new accessibility argument. 

I didn’t really make an argument. My point was to show a couple articles to rebut your original sub-point, that is, that the UK system is “miles better than the US system”.  With respect to accessibility, I agree with you. But there are many metrics in which the US system is far better than the UK system. I don’t really care either way.
            Yeah I didn't specify how the UK has a better system than the US, I assumed it was clear that I could be talking about any number of things. It's not that it's a new point, I just wasn't being too specific about it. Sure the other metrics may exist, but they in no way make up for the glaring flaws with the American system, but again that's just something I wasn't specific enough on is all
                Agreed, though. The US system is shit. :-)
No, it doesn’t. I said the personality traits of someone doesn’t matter when assessing that person’s ideas. What made the Nazi’s bad is that they wanted to exterminate an entire race of people. Not that their leader was an asshole.
    But the entire beginning and main reason for the nazi's to start doing what they did is because hitler was a asshole who hated jews,  and he manipulated the people into starting this entire hatred because of the poor conditions Germany was left in after ww1 from the treaty of Versailles
        So if someone were to ask you why Nazism is bad you think “because Hitler was mean” would be a stronger argument than “because they believed in murdering millions of innocent people”?
            It doesn't matter about stronger arguments, it matters because the nazis believed in murdering millions of innocents and that hitler was a dickhead who started it all because he was butthurt. Anyways why are you arguing history on a bioshock subreddit? No one cares.
                You’re literally the one who brought it up. 

And I’m debating this because summarizing Rapture’s demise as “well Andrew Ryan was an asshole” is doing an extreme disservice to Ken Levine and the immense effort put into the game around historical and political commentary. The ideas of this game go way deeper than that.
                Because like fucking 200 of you dipshits completely missed this random person's point, and I just accidentally stumbled in this thread. 

I don't even really play Bioshock. I played the first one like 10 years ago, it was cool but this little thread managed to piss me off. It’s just so dumb to witness. This is a microcosm of the apparent dumbing down of society in favor of tumorous circle jerks of people desperate for validation.
        Alright.

Hitler hated animal abuse. Is abusing animals good?
            >	Alright.

>	Hitler hated animal abuse. Is abusing animals good?

Of course not. Hitler had a few positive philosophies, such as his stance on animal cruelty and vegetarianism. Hitler *also* had far more negative philosophies. His ridiculous, almost comically evil philosophies, ideals, and actions drown out the little positive about him. 

Hitler being anti-animal cruelty doesn’t magically make animal cruelty good and doesn’t magically make Hitler good.
                **Which was exactly the dude's point.**

Why did you all gang up on him like he was an asshole who was wrong? This literally was his point.

If I stay on Reddit too long, I swear I'm gonna get a fucking hemmorhage.
What a gish-gallop of an argument. 

>Actively forsaking altruism

My guess is you're using this term in a different way than Rand does. I'm guessing you mean it to be simple charity. Rand means it as complete self-sacrifice to the needs of others.

> idea that people are useless parasites unless they're profitable in all things

Where does Rand say this?

>the very idea that men like Ryan are in any way self-made

How aren't they?

>a lack of any commitment to the common good or society

What's a common good?

I'd venture if I asked a Christian what the common good is they'd say for everyone to be a Christian and serve their fellow Christians. I'd venture a guess that you would not consider this to be "common good". I'd further venture the Christian would disagree with what you consider "the common good".

>scorn for any form of regulation

The free market actively provides regulation without government intervention.

>seeing social safety nets as a bad thing

Social safety nets aren't a bad thing. It's government involvement in them and compulsion to pay into them that are the bad things in objectivism.

>and I could go on and on

Bring it on.

>Rand refined the capitalist/libertarian ethos into a modern idealogy that espouses profit and selfish objectivism over compassion and base humanity.

Profit, you mean what's gained by both members to a voluntary transaction?

"Selfish", there's nothing wrong with rational self-interest.

Compassion, again, what's compassion and how is Rand against it?

Base humanity, ah yes, truly serving humanity is holding a gun to someone's head and making them pay for things for others.

>who believe in the myth of infinite growth

Define the myth of infinite growth and describe how it's a myth.

How does Rand's philosophy lead people to treat others like numbers?

How does Rand's philosophy lead people to wreak havoc on the world?

How does Rand's philosophy lead people to stack the deck in their favor against the people who make them their money?

>Rand envisioned in Atlas Shrugged where all the rich ass hats go after literally nuking the means of production so the "parasitic" poor can't benefit from their absence.

Why is anyone entitled to the innovation, mind, or labor of another?
    1. Rand means it in the sense of any societal safety net or sacrificing self-interest in the slightest. Her "heroes" are all self-serving ass hats who embody the myth of the self-made man ignoring that their workers and society as a whole enabled made the making of that money. In addition, she seems to ascribe to the “Great Man” theory of history which is just flat-out wrong.

2. Have you read Atlas Shrugged? It’s full of her macho business Daddies going on and on about how there are two types of people in the world, comparing most people to parasites. Not to mention the whole train tunnel sequence where she gleefully recounts thousands of people dying or the terrorist working for Galt that blows up the means of production so the “parasite” workers can’t seize them.

3. I’m glad you asked, men like Ryan, and their modern-day counterparts, are built by investments made into society itself, public infrastructure which they exploit, and being utter sociopaths to accumulate power and wealth. Ryan only got to where he was because of a lack of regulation, luck, and a cutthroat attitude that allowed him to become a modern-day robber baron literally burning down forests to stop them from being nationalized. 

4. I don’t know, clean drinking water and food, public roads and highways to allow freedom of movement for both economic and personal reasons, robust public programs that help people improve themselves and their situation instead of letting poverty consume them while the well to do live off their labor. Public health via regulation on pollutants/food safety/health care, and personal protections for marginalized groups and labor rights. All the things men like Ryan hate because it’s harder to control your workers when they have their basic needs met.

5.  The fuck it does. Insulin, a vital drug that’s so easy to make it was patented for $2, is hundreds of times more expensive in the US because the Pharma companies can charge it. Rivers were literally lighting on fire before regulation forced the companies dumping chemicals to stop. Company stores, industrial rape in mining communities, and child laborers were all major common issues across the US before the labor movement fought for and won protections under the law. The Free Market regulates itself about as much as a child with a plate of cookies does, they will always do all they can to make as much money as possible, no matter the personal or environmental cost. Hell, look out your window at the looming climate crisis, oil companies knew all about Climate Change going as far back as the fifties, but goose-stepped their way into it anyway, all for profit. If you honestly believe the free market regulates itself, you’re incredibly naive.

6. States (in the national sense), municipalities, and communities are the only entities capable of running a social safety net, and taxpayers paying into those social safety nets are always a net gain if they’re robust enough to actually improve people’s lives. Relying on a private option or charity does not work, under Reagan, he used the myth of the welfare queen to cut social program spending which led to an almost unprecedented increase in food insecurity while his complete stonewalling of aid for the AIDS crisis killed thousands of people. When the richest, most powerful government on earth focuses more on toppling democratically elected governments in South America, pouring billions into defense contractors' coffers, and the myth of trickle-down economics people die. The New Deal, while being capitalism’s last saving grace before an inevitable worker’s revolt, saved this country and millions of people were uplifted out of poverty because of it. Excuse me if I don’t trust the robber barons who want to go back to a time before it.

7. “Rational self-interest” has always been code for “I don’t think everyone deserves their basic needs met because I like the power it gives me”. And in the world Rand espouses, and Rapture demonstrates it’s not so much voluntary when one or two assholes can take over an entire industry/niche and then price gouge the fuck out of everyone. Profit is a drug that’s going to kill us all, a desire for profit led a fucking fruit company to use the CIA to coup a democratically elected leader because he wanted his country to control their fruit orchards, and profit led to Oil companies knowingly walking us into a climate disaster that could end all life as we know it, profit led to a mother deciding how long she can starve herself so her child can get the medicine they need to live. Living in a truly functioning and just society means investing in that society, taxes are part of that considering you use roads, sewers, and all the numerous programs that make your life as safe as can be (I.E the fire department, the FDA keeping you from eating poison or fake food, and the EPA keeping your water safe to drink ETC.) That’s compassion, paying into the system so that you and your fellow man can live in a society where they won’t be written off because they fell through the cracks, Rand is a hypocrite (died on government assistance gladly) and the mother of the worst aspect of Capitalist thought.

8. Look at the stock market, look at every company that demands growth year over year while still making insane amounts of profit. Taking and taking while all the while reducing what they’re actually offering and doing all they can to escape liability for their mistakes. Look at the Sacklers who fed the opioid crisis to grow their business exponentially year after year or the price of life-saving drugs (mostly paid for by federal taxpayer money) just to make even more insane profit, look at oil companies who killed every step towards a cleaner future and are fixing/overcharging for their products to make record profits while the world slips into climate coma. Capitalism demands infinite growth to please shareholders who have no idea what the real world is, and in that infinite growth myth, it aspires to its highest form. A cancer cell strangling the rest of humanity.

9. When all of your concern is your own self-interest, profits, and a disregard for safety or regulation of any kind the people actually generating that wealth become just another number. Look at how labor in this country treated people, especially women and children, in the gilded age and company town era. Children often worked in factories losing fingers and limbs on an industrial scale, and in the hay day of the company town, industrial-scale rape was practically institutionalized so sick or wounded men wouldn’t be thrown out on the street. This naturally leads to the red lining and Robert Moses’ active destruction of any chance for walkable cities in America and the advent of sealing off entire communities to die because they were poor and or POC. 

10. Lack of regulation (Climate change, mass exploitation of marginalized groups, health crises like the ones that saw the formation of the FDA) leads to death, sickness, and exploitation on a societal scale. Not to mention that Rand’s objectivism philosophy lends itself well to colonialism and imperialism just with a capitalist “Great man” theory bent.

11. See 10. because unregulated capitalists will do all they can to give themselves more power and money while stripping any chance of mobility from the workforce that makes them their money. Otherwise known as the “fuck you got mine” attitude that people like Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and every “self-made” man espouses.

12. Because they didn’t build it, workers did. Engineers, researchers, laborers, and everyone else who had a hand in the creation, innovation, and growth of the organization. If Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk alone could make a billion dollars without the thousands of people minimum it took to make it, then by all means do it, but in reality, they aren’t the gods amongst men that Rand paints men like them as. They’re just good at exploiting people, our toxic capitalist system, and making the cold calls that accrue the money they didn’t earn. Ryan didn’t build Rapture, Musk didn’t create Space X’s rockets or even found Tesla, and Bezos got extremely lucky and had nearly half a million dollars from his folks to create Amazon. If they alone had twenty dollars and a can-do attitude they’d die in the gutter like the rest of us. 

TL;DR: You missed the point of Bioshock because it touches on every fucking point I did. If you want to read about Rand's business daddies and fucking fountain heads, then by all means do, just don't base your world view on it.
Honestly, why then?  He was being a bit...strong headed, but that seemed to be the main point he was making.
    >	Honestly, why then?  He was being a bit…strong headed, but that seemed to be the main point he was making.

Because he is completely ignoring that Andrew Ryan had a shitty personality in addition to shitty philosophy, and shitty actions.

Edit: plus the whole defending Hitler bit.
        Well, I think you're missing their point.  He's not saying that Andrew Ryan has a good personality, or ignoring that it's bad...he's saying that it's not a good reason *on its own* to dislike his politics.   It's basically an ad hominem argument.

Andrew Ryan could have a great personality and we would still disagree with their politics.  A hypothetical person may be a complete asshole, but I might still like their politics (see the current "lesser of two evils" state of US politics).

The question is just...why do we need to talk about his personality at all when discussing their politics?

Also, where did he defend Hitler...?

I firmly believe Ryan’s personality fueled his actions, and it bears discussion. His stubbornness, his pride, his lack of empathy, and his greed all fed into his decision to build Rapture, his choice of government style, and his ineptitude in dealing with Fontaine. 

No, someone’s personality doesn’t always merit a discussion. Sometimes it even detracts from the discussion. That is not the case when it comes to Andrew Ryan. 

>	Also, where did he defend Hitler…?

Alright, I’ll admit I misinterpreted one their comments.
                Ah, now I understand you. Yes, I would agree with all of your points then :) Sorry to drag this on for so long, but thanks for humoring me.
Lamb is more a collectivist cult than analogous to communism in the text. She espouses something closer to a religious commune than the economic system of communism as she's still at the top of a hierarchy while the people don't really control anything. Ryan represents Randian objectivism and capitalism, but Lamb doesn't represent Communism, just a radical collectivism that sacrifices the individual.
    That’s what communism is, though. The root word of communism is “commune” which refers to a collectivist society
        because root words = definition
            Yes. Words mean what they mean. That’s why root words exist. That’s how you know “hydrotherapy” means “water therapy” or how you know “Annual” is derived from the Latin Anno meaning year or how Dominion and Dominance both come from the Latin Dominus meaning Lord
                “Words mean what they mean”

Yeah, and what they mean is not tied to the letters that form them. This is such a strange argument to make considering there are hundreds of words whose meanings differ than their roots. Especially for a word like communism which comes from a word meaning “for the community” and not “a collectivist society” or whatever you just pulled out of thin air.

Edit: literally in your own example, you say two words that come from “the lord” and yet have nothing to do with it now. You don’t seem to grasp how language works.
    "a radical collectivism that sacrifices the individual" Yeah communism
        Marxism is deliberately anarchistic and rejects both hierarchy and statism. Lamb, by definition, is not a Marxist. Maybe, *maybe* a commentary on Stalinism's authoritarian collectivism and cult of personality, but certainly not in any way a valid critique of actual Marxism.
Marx actually contributed alot to the devolpment and reform to human rights. Much like the early soviet union

        You do realise that’s how education works, right? No one is born knowing information
        I'm literally taking a class on the soviet union, and WWI

The soviet union devolped large amounts of Human rights under the rule of Bolchevic. It was the first time women had complete equality. It wasn't until he died and Stalin came in power that the soviet union became a mess.
            Wonder how many women scholars would agree that women had complete equality in soviet russia.
                They did specify "before Stalin" which is fair enough.  During Stalin's rule and ever since after, Russia has been a human rights nightmare I don't think anyone would deny that.
                Original values were that people were people.
            yeah , and that's exactly the point. communism became a mess because it doesn't work. people will always mess it.
                Communism under an authoritarian government will never work because it’s an oppressive system. We’ve yet to see an example of democratic communism
Have you missed what I said about competition ?

DO you understand what happens to prices when companies compete for customers?

And as I said before  : this is a vending machine price (middleman + overhead  involved) .   A shop price in NORMAL Rapture could easily be half your $20.

Post Chaos Rapture when money is nearly worthless and being found on the ground - it doesnt even make sense that all the machines are NOT EMPTY (if Raptures in as bad a state as the writers want to make the situation ). 

.
    I'm referring to medkits in competition with doctors and normal medical treatment, I made it abundantly clear that I was in each response. If you're still not seeing the point I can't help you any further.
        yes and if the kits work very well the doctors dont have much to do and likely move on to do things the kits cant do

more complicated operations.therapies would likely still require manual applications (including ADAM)

we are talking about costs of medi-kits not doctor treatments

$20 in a vending machine ...

you think a shop in NORMAL Rapture has it for the same price ?

if you can easily buy it in a shop then you dont in a machine 

machines aspect is being convenient which in our world people are willing to pay the premium price for (or the machines wouldnt exist)
            A quote from the first thing I said here.

"...it would have revolutionized healthcare for such a low price as to have put doctors out of business aside from specialists and top surgeons. Your average GP would be screwed with health stations in very convenient locations..."

You're literally repeating what I said earlier while making baseless speculations on prices, and to my knowledge there was only one company making medkits to begin with. I feel like you're intentionally trying to argue at this point so I won't bother responding to you anymore, you're going in circles at this point.

Yep. That’s u/premer777 for you. They look at Rapture and say “hey, this is a good idea. That Andrew Ryan is a pretty swell fellow.” 

Welcome to the wonderful world of Ryan fanboys.
                except Im trying to get thru to you that your $20 price out of a machine may : during a chaos world dystopia  ISNT THE SAME as when its in  NORMAL Rapture and when sold in shops (and with likely multiple manufacturers) .

ayn rand is not the 'end all and be all' of Objectivism.

> that discounts morality and props up uninhibited behavior as much as ryan does. 


What does he prop up ?  And use examples of what was in original pre-kashmir rapture and not in the chaos rapture where society had already disintegrated  and Ryan is in emergency/war mode.

Consider that Fontaines crimes were done in secret -- indicating it was NOT freely allowed or accepted or 'uninhibited'.

The writers hardly allowed any action by the populace as they needed that easy dystopia story 

Also the author of the  'rapture novel' has  just ups the stuff in the game (again I assert its post chaos an dNOT normal Rapture)  as most takes place before the chaos begins and he needs all the action to spice up the book.

I've elsewhere explained where the Grocery store guy story is bosh because it ignores so ***MANY*** possible alternates the victim had to to the abusive neighbor short of shooting him. The common neighborhood mechanism were completely ignored (just pay a kid to haul your trash guy ...) The author had to simpleton-style prop up the 'dystopia'  (perhaps didn't want to contradict the games similar pattern of ignorance).  Seriously  Its like these people HADNT operated in the mean world of the surface before they got to rapture.  

The nationalized Fontaine Futuistsics is similar 'baaaad ryan'  smear.   The addicts needed ADAM, Fontaines assets would have been used for reparations to his victims and the 3 1/2 month period this happen (before the terrorist chaos began) didnt allow any story of what was to be done in a more complete plan.

So really its the writers who needing their 'easy' story for a slaughter-fest dystopia, ignored basics of objectivism/libertarianism and carelessly contrive a storyline with its 'hate ryan' mantra to cover for that midgame 'plot twist'  (and no Choice  to NOT follow the sociopath atlas - not giving their twist  away to the player) 

I can say this because the writers are inconsistent and have things so contradictory to what they say Rapture operated (and what the world in general operates through).

You’ve mentioned this idea of Ryan using Fontaine Futuristics as reparations. It was hilarious then and hilarious now. What evidence can you provide fron *any* of Andrew Ryan’s words or actions would ***ever*** give you the idea that he would use the assets for reparations? What evidence can you provide fron *any* of Andrew Ryan’s words or actions would ***ever*** even attempt to consider paying reparations? 

What evidence can you provide fron *any* of Andrew Ryan’s words or actions that indicated Ryan even had a plan to fix Adam? An inkling of an idea that he would try to fix Adam? 

>	contrive a storyline with its ‘hate ryan’ mantra to cover for that midgame ‘plot twist’  (and no Choice  to NOT follow the sociopath atlas - not giving their twist  away to the player)

Did you miss the part where it was Andrew Ryan demanding Jack kill him? Ryan was there. Ryan was in full control. Ryan could have ordered Jack away, could have conceivably ordered Jack to kill Atlas. Instead, he decided to pick up his toys and go home. Ryan decided to blow up his city, and order his son to brutally beat him to death, and even turned off his private vita chamber so Ryan wouldn’t be reborn. 

>	I can say this because the writers are inconsistent and have things so contradictory to what they say Rapture operated

You’ve claimed this before, but have never once been able to back it up. What was inconsistent about the writing of Bioshock? What was contradictory in the plot? I’m eagerly awaiting an example.
        cant help you if you have no understanding about how things work.

your simpleton arguments are always 'it was never said in the game' 

and my reply is that the game if full of gaps and vagaries where much which HAD TO BE THERE  was never mentioned.

Insults without any kind of evidence. Classic u/premer777. 

>	and my reply is that the game if full of gaps and vagaries where much which HAD TO BE THERE  was never mentioned.

I pulled out specific things to address because you claim they’re in character. Show me the evidence. 

I’m still waiting for an example of a contradiction, fyi.


'Free Press' that misses the whole  INSANITY, DEFORMATION CANCERY STUFF with ADAM  - conveniently until Ryan is now able to be blamed for it is my simple argument --- with the Game Writers playing with the  story details to make them fit their BLAME RYAN plot.

So the Writers inconsistency about an ACTUALLY WORKING  Free Press is not really there for that one VERY IMPORTANT game explanation.

-

You might want to review what I was referencing about Pre-Wilson/FDR as to the less regulated capitalism in the US.  If you don't know what I am talking about, you have a huge gap in your understanding of US History.

Andrew Ryan *isn’t* blamed for the side effects. There *are* no newspaper headlines about Adam side effects, period. 

What Ryan *is* blamed for is his inaction towards Adam. 

>	So the Writers inconsistency about an ACTUALLY WORKING  Free Press is not really there for that one VERY IMPORTANT game explanation.

As a reminder, “free press” means free from government intervention and government censorship. It doesn’t mean “always perusing the truth in the name of the best interest of the people.” 

For example, the US has free press. The US’s press coverage of certain events can be extremely disappointing.

Interestingly enough, Andrew Ryan actually kills the free press in Rapture. He orders all publications to cease, and places a lock down on the PA system. 

>	You might want to review what I was referencing about Pre-Wilson/FDR as to the less regulated capitalism in the US.  If you don’t know what I am talking about, you have a huge gap in your understanding of US History.

It’s like you’ve never heard of price fixing, captive markets, company towns, monopolies, etc. Do you understand *why* the Progressive Era happened in the US? Hint: Unregulated capitalism which resulted in widespread abuses of workers and consumers. Oh, hey, and let’s not forget child labor in factories, and mines. 

People who ~~live in glass houses~~ don’t know what free press and price fixing are shouldn’t throw throw stones.

Edit: Formatting
I know I've been playing both sides of it and it's fun
I mean they only show glimpses of pre civil war the main game is set in a post civil war and in anarchy so its not the main focus. Also bill McDonagh mentions elections in an audio diary but is a blink and you miss it thing
    >	I mean they only show glimpses of pre civil war the main game is set in a post civil war and in anarchy so its not the main focus.

Not really. The audio diaries make it abundantly clear all was not well in Zion prior to the Civil War.
This is a misreading of my point. I'm not claiming that the UK has better wait times than the US, I'm saying that it surpasses the IS in accessibility. Sure we have longer wait times, mostly for things that aren't life threatening triage is always necessary when there's a high enough volume of patients, the thing is it still far outpaces the US in one very important regard. The wait times in America may be shorter, but this only applies if you can afford to pay. It's inevitable that the US would have shorter wait times because all too often people can't afford to be treated in the first place. I should have made it clear that I was comparing the UK to the rest of Europe with regard to wait times and quality of care etc and not the us because America doesn't share the most basic requirement of medical care: that people are actually able to get it. Also even in the quality of care department I'd say the UK pulls ahead because there isn't the same prevalence of over prescription of opioids leading to a national crisis of addiction in the UK as in the US.

Tldr UK still vastly outpaces US in medical care because it's accessible and not the source of an opioid crisis.
    Hummm. This seems to be a completely new point you are making now, so I’m not sure how it’s a misreading of your original point. 

Your original points were (1) that the UK has a mixed system, (2) the UK health system is shitty and underfunded (But “miles better than. The US”), (3) private companies sway policy, and (perhaps) destroy “every public service”. 

I appreciate your brand spanking new accessibility argument. 

I didn’t really make an argument. My point was to show a couple articles to rebut your original sub-point, that is, that the UK system is “miles better than the US system”.  With respect to accessibility, I agree with you. But there are many metrics in which the US system is far better than the UK system. I don’t really care either way.
        Yeah I didn't specify how the UK has a better system than the US, I assumed it was clear that I could be talking about any number of things. It's not that it's a new point, I just wasn't being too specific about it. Sure the other metrics may exist, but they in no way make up for the glaring flaws with the American system, but again that's just something I wasn't specific enough on is all
            Agreed, though. The US system is shit. :-)
But the entire beginning and main reason for the nazi's to start doing what they did is because hitler was a asshole who hated jews,  and he manipulated the people into starting this entire hatred because of the poor conditions Germany was left in after ww1 from the treaty of Versailles
    So if someone were to ask you why Nazism is bad you think “because Hitler was mean” would be a stronger argument than “because they believed in murdering millions of innocent people”?
        It doesn't matter about stronger arguments, it matters because the nazis believed in murdering millions of innocents and that hitler was a dickhead who started it all because he was butthurt. Anyways why are you arguing history on a bioshock subreddit? No one cares.
            You’re literally the one who brought it up. 

And I’m debating this because summarizing Rapture’s demise as “well Andrew Ryan was an asshole” is doing an extreme disservice to Ken Levine and the immense effort put into the game around historical and political commentary. The ideas of this game go way deeper than that.
            Because like fucking 200 of you dipshits completely missed this random person's point, and I just accidentally stumbled in this thread. 

I don't even really play Bioshock. I played the first one like 10 years ago, it was cool but this little thread managed to piss me off. It’s just so dumb to witness. This is a microcosm of the apparent dumbing down of society in favor of tumorous circle jerks of people desperate for validation.
    Alright.

Hitler hated animal abuse. Is abusing animals good?
        >	Alright.

>	Hitler hated animal abuse. Is abusing animals good?

Of course not. Hitler had a few positive philosophies, such as his stance on animal cruelty and vegetarianism. Hitler *also* had far more negative philosophies. His ridiculous, almost comically evil philosophies, ideals, and actions drown out the little positive about him. 

Hitler being anti-animal cruelty doesn’t magically make animal cruelty good and doesn’t magically make Hitler good.
            **Which was exactly the dude's point.**

Why did you all gang up on him like he was an asshole who was wrong? This literally was his point.

If I stay on Reddit too long, I swear I'm gonna get a fucking hemmorhage.
1. Rand means it in the sense of any societal safety net or sacrificing self-interest in the slightest. Her "heroes" are all self-serving ass hats who embody the myth of the self-made man ignoring that their workers and society as a whole enabled made the making of that money. In addition, she seems to ascribe to the “Great Man” theory of history which is just flat-out wrong.

2. Have you read Atlas Shrugged? It’s full of her macho business Daddies going on and on about how there are two types of people in the world, comparing most people to parasites. Not to mention the whole train tunnel sequence where she gleefully recounts thousands of people dying or the terrorist working for Galt that blows up the means of production so the “parasite” workers can’t seize them.

3. I’m glad you asked, men like Ryan, and their modern-day counterparts, are built by investments made into society itself, public infrastructure which they exploit, and being utter sociopaths to accumulate power and wealth. Ryan only got to where he was because of a lack of regulation, luck, and a cutthroat attitude that allowed him to become a modern-day robber baron literally burning down forests to stop them from being nationalized. 

4. I don’t know, clean drinking water and food, public roads and highways to allow freedom of movement for both economic and personal reasons, robust public programs that help people improve themselves and their situation instead of letting poverty consume them while the well to do live off their labor. Public health via regulation on pollutants/food safety/health care, and personal protections for marginalized groups and labor rights. All the things men like Ryan hate because it’s harder to control your workers when they have their basic needs met.

5.  The fuck it does. Insulin, a vital drug that’s so easy to make it was patented for $2, is hundreds of times more expensive in the US because the Pharma companies can charge it. Rivers were literally lighting on fire before regulation forced the companies dumping chemicals to stop. Company stores, industrial rape in mining communities, and child laborers were all major common issues across the US before the labor movement fought for and won protections under the law. The Free Market regulates itself about as much as a child with a plate of cookies does, they will always do all they can to make as much money as possible, no matter the personal or environmental cost. Hell, look out your window at the looming climate crisis, oil companies knew all about Climate Change going as far back as the fifties, but goose-stepped their way into it anyway, all for profit. If you honestly believe the free market regulates itself, you’re incredibly naive.

6. States (in the national sense), municipalities, and communities are the only entities capable of running a social safety net, and taxpayers paying into those social safety nets are always a net gain if they’re robust enough to actually improve people’s lives. Relying on a private option or charity does not work, under Reagan, he used the myth of the welfare queen to cut social program spending which led to an almost unprecedented increase in food insecurity while his complete stonewalling of aid for the AIDS crisis killed thousands of people. When the richest, most powerful government on earth focuses more on toppling democratically elected governments in South America, pouring billions into defense contractors' coffers, and the myth of trickle-down economics people die. The New Deal, while being capitalism’s last saving grace before an inevitable worker’s revolt, saved this country and millions of people were uplifted out of poverty because of it. Excuse me if I don’t trust the robber barons who want to go back to a time before it.

7. “Rational self-interest” has always been code for “I don’t think everyone deserves their basic needs met because I like the power it gives me”. And in the world Rand espouses, and Rapture demonstrates it’s not so much voluntary when one or two assholes can take over an entire industry/niche and then price gouge the fuck out of everyone. Profit is a drug that’s going to kill us all, a desire for profit led a fucking fruit company to use the CIA to coup a democratically elected leader because he wanted his country to control their fruit orchards, and profit led to Oil companies knowingly walking us into a climate disaster that could end all life as we know it, profit led to a mother deciding how long she can starve herself so her child can get the medicine they need to live. Living in a truly functioning and just society means investing in that society, taxes are part of that considering you use roads, sewers, and all the numerous programs that make your life as safe as can be (I.E the fire department, the FDA keeping you from eating poison or fake food, and the EPA keeping your water safe to drink ETC.) That’s compassion, paying into the system so that you and your fellow man can live in a society where they won’t be written off because they fell through the cracks, Rand is a hypocrite (died on government assistance gladly) and the mother of the worst aspect of Capitalist thought.

8. Look at the stock market, look at every company that demands growth year over year while still making insane amounts of profit. Taking and taking while all the while reducing what they’re actually offering and doing all they can to escape liability for their mistakes. Look at the Sacklers who fed the opioid crisis to grow their business exponentially year after year or the price of life-saving drugs (mostly paid for by federal taxpayer money) just to make even more insane profit, look at oil companies who killed every step towards a cleaner future and are fixing/overcharging for their products to make record profits while the world slips into climate coma. Capitalism demands infinite growth to please shareholders who have no idea what the real world is, and in that infinite growth myth, it aspires to its highest form. A cancer cell strangling the rest of humanity.

9. When all of your concern is your own self-interest, profits, and a disregard for safety or regulation of any kind the people actually generating that wealth become just another number. Look at how labor in this country treated people, especially women and children, in the gilded age and company town era. Children often worked in factories losing fingers and limbs on an industrial scale, and in the hay day of the company town, industrial-scale rape was practically institutionalized so sick or wounded men wouldn’t be thrown out on the street. This naturally leads to the red lining and Robert Moses’ active destruction of any chance for walkable cities in America and the advent of sealing off entire communities to die because they were poor and or POC. 

10. Lack of regulation (Climate change, mass exploitation of marginalized groups, health crises like the ones that saw the formation of the FDA) leads to death, sickness, and exploitation on a societal scale. Not to mention that Rand’s objectivism philosophy lends itself well to colonialism and imperialism just with a capitalist “Great man” theory bent.

11. See 10. because unregulated capitalists will do all they can to give themselves more power and money while stripping any chance of mobility from the workforce that makes them their money. Otherwise known as the “fuck you got mine” attitude that people like Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and every “self-made” man espouses.

12. Because they didn’t build it, workers did. Engineers, researchers, laborers, and everyone else who had a hand in the creation, innovation, and growth of the organization. If Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk alone could make a billion dollars without the thousands of people minimum it took to make it, then by all means do it, but in reality, they aren’t the gods amongst men that Rand paints men like them as. They’re just good at exploiting people, our toxic capitalist system, and making the cold calls that accrue the money they didn’t earn. Ryan didn’t build Rapture, Musk didn’t create Space X’s rockets or even found Tesla, and Bezos got extremely lucky and had nearly half a million dollars from his folks to create Amazon. If they alone had twenty dollars and a can-do attitude they’d die in the gutter like the rest of us. 

TL;DR: You missed the point of Bioshock because it touches on every fucking point I did. If you want to read about Rand's business daddies and fucking fountain heads, then by all means do, just don't base your world view on it.
>	Honestly, why then?  He was being a bit…strong headed, but that seemed to be the main point he was making.

Because he is completely ignoring that Andrew Ryan had a shitty personality in addition to shitty philosophy, and shitty actions.

Edit: plus the whole defending Hitler bit.
    Well, I think you're missing their point.  He's not saying that Andrew Ryan has a good personality, or ignoring that it's bad...he's saying that it's not a good reason *on its own* to dislike his politics.   It's basically an ad hominem argument.

Andrew Ryan could have a great personality and we would still disagree with their politics.  A hypothetical person may be a complete asshole, but I might still like their politics (see the current "lesser of two evils" state of US politics).

The question is just...why do we need to talk about his personality at all when discussing their politics?

Also, where did he defend Hitler...?

>	The question is just…why do we need to talk about his personality at all when discussing their politics?

I firmly believe Ryan’s personality fueled his actions, and it bears discussion. His stubbornness, his pride, his lack of empathy, and his greed all fed into his decision to build Rapture, his choice of government style, and his ineptitude in dealing with Fontaine. 

No, someone’s personality doesn’t always merit a discussion. Sometimes it even detracts from the discussion. That is not the case when it comes to Andrew Ryan. 

>	Also, where did he defend Hitler…?

Alright, I’ll admit I misinterpreted one their comments.
            Ah, now I understand you. Yes, I would agree with all of your points then :) Sorry to drag this on for so long, but thanks for humoring me.
That’s what communism is, though. The root word of communism is “commune” which refers to a collectivist society
    because root words = definition
        Yes. Words mean what they mean. That’s why root words exist. That’s how you know “hydrotherapy” means “water therapy” or how you know “Annual” is derived from the Latin Anno meaning year or how Dominion and Dominance both come from the Latin Dominus meaning Lord
            “Words mean what they mean”

Yeah, and what they mean is not tied to the letters that form them. This is such a strange argument to make considering there are hundreds of words whose meanings differ than their roots.

>	contrive a storyline with its ‘hate ryan’ mantra to cover for that midgame ‘plot twist’  (and no Choice  to NOT follow the sociopath atlas - not giving their twist  away to the player)

Did you miss the part where it was Andrew Ryan demanding Jack kill him? Ryan was there. Ryan was in full control. Ryan could have ordered Jack away, could have conceivably ordered Jack to kill Atlas. Instead, he decided to pick up his toys and go home. Ryan decided to blow up his city, and order his son to brutally beat him to death, and even turned off his private vita chamber so Ryan wouldn’t be reborn. 

>	I can say this because the writers are inconsistent and have things so contradictory to what they say Rapture operated

You’ve claimed this before, but have never once been able to back it up. What was inconsistent about the writing of Bioshock? What was contradictory in the plot? I’m eagerly awaiting an example.
    cant help you if you have no understanding about how things work.

your simpleton arguments are always 'it was never said in the game' 

and my reply is that the game if full of gaps and vagaries where much which HAD TO BE THERE  was never mentioned.

Insults without any kind of evidence. Classic u/premer777. 

>	and my reply is that the game if full of gaps and vagaries where much which HAD TO BE THERE  was never mentioned.

I pulled out specific things to address because you claim they’re in character. Show me the evidence. 

I’m still waiting for an example of a contradiction, fyi.
>	‘Free Press’ that misses the whole  INSANITY, DEFORMATION CANCERY STUFF with ADAM  - conveniently until Ryan is now able to be blamed for it is my simple argument — with the Game Writers playing with the  story details to make them fit their BLAME RYAN plot.

Andrew Ryan *isn’t* blamed for the side effects. There *are* no newspaper headlines about Adam side effects, period. 

What Ryan *is* blamed for is his inaction towards Adam. 

>	So the Writers inconsistency about an ACTUALLY WORKING  Free Press is not really there for that one VERY IMPORTANT game explanation.

As a reminder, “free press” means free from government intervention and government censorship. It doesn’t mean “always perusing the truth in the name of the best interest of the people.” 

For example, the US has free press. The US’s press coverage of certain events can be extremely disappointing.

Interestingly enough, Andrew Ryan actually kills the free press in Rapture. He orders all publications to cease, and places a lock down on the PA system. 

>	You might want to review what I was referencing about Pre-Wilson/FDR as to the less regulated capitalism in the US.  If you don’t know what I am talking about, you have a huge gap in your understanding of US History.

It’s like you’ve never heard of price fixing, captive markets, company towns, monopolies, etc. Do you understand *why* the Progressive Era happened in the US? Hint: Unregulated capitalism which resulted in widespread abuses of workers and consumers. Oh, hey, and let’s not forget child labor in factories, and mines. 

People who ~~live in glass houses~~ don’t know what free press and price fixing are shouldn’t throw throw stones.

Edit: Formatting
>	I mean they only show glimpses of pre civil war the main game is set in a post civil war and in anarchy so its not the main focus.

Not really. The audio diaries make it abundantly clear all was not well in Zion prior to the Civil War.
Hummm. This seems to be a completely new point you are making now, so I’m not sure how it’s a misreading of your original point. 

Your original points were (1) that the UK has a mixed system, (2) the UK health system is shitty and underfunded (But “miles better than. The US”), (3) private companies sway policy, and (perhaps) destroy “every public service”. 

I appreciate your brand spanking new accessibility argument. 

I didn’t really make an argument. My point was to show a couple articles to rebut your original sub-point, that is, that the UK system is “miles better than the US system”.  With respect to accessibility, I agree with you. But there are many metrics in which the US system is far better than the UK system. I don’t really care either way.
    Yeah I didn't specify how the UK has a better system than the US, I assumed it was clear that I could be talking about any number of things. It's not that it's a new point, I just wasn't being too specific about it. Sure the other metrics may exist, but they in no way make up for the glaring flaws with the American system, but again that's just something I wasn't specific enough on is all
        Agreed, though. The US system is shit. :-)
So if someone were to ask you why Nazism is bad you think “because Hitler was mean” would be a stronger argument than “because they believed in murdering millions of innocent people”?
    It doesn't matter about stronger arguments, it matters because the nazis believed in murdering millions of innocents and that hitler was a dickhead who started it all because he was butthurt. Anyways why are you arguing history on a bioshock subreddit? No one cares.
        You’re literally the one who brought it up. 

And I’m debating this because summarizing Rapture’s demise as “well Andrew Ryan was an asshole” is doing an extreme disservice to Ken Levine and the immense effort put into the game around historical and political commentary. The ideas of this game go way deeper than that.
        Because like fucking 200 of you dipshits completely missed this random person's point, and I just accidentally stumbled in this thread. 

I don't even really play Bioshock. I played the first one like 10 years ago, it was cool but this little thread managed to piss me off. It’s just so dumb to witness. This is a microcosm of the apparent dumbing down of society in favor of tumorous circle jerks of people desperate for validation.
Alright.

Hitler hated animal abuse. Is abusing animals good?
    >	Alright.

>	Hitler hated animal abuse. Is abusing animals good?

Of course not. Hitler had a few positive philosophies, such as his stance on animal cruelty and vegetarianism. Hitler *also* had far more negative philosophies. His ridiculous, almost comically evil philosophies, ideals, and actions drown out the little positive about him. 

Hitler being anti-animal cruelty doesn’t magically make animal cruelty good and doesn’t magically make Hitler good.
        **Which was exactly the dude's point.**

Why did you all gang up on him like he was an asshole who was wrong? This literally was his point.

If I stay on Reddit too long, I swear I'm gonna get a fucking hemmorhage.
Well, I think you're missing their point.  He's not saying that Andrew Ryan has a good personality, or ignoring that it's bad...he's saying that it's not a good reason *on its own* to dislike his politics.   It's basically an ad hominem argument.

Andrew Ryan could have a great personality and we would still disagree with their politics.  A hypothetical person may be a complete asshole, but I might still like their politics (see the current "lesser of two evils" state of US politics).

The question is just...why do we need to talk about his personality at all when discussing their politics?

Also, where did he defend Hitler...?

I firmly believe Ryan’s personality fueled his actions, and it bears discussion. His stubbornness, his pride, his lack of empathy, and his greed all fed into his decision to build Rapture, his choice of government style, and his ineptitude in dealing with Fontaine. 

No, someone’s personality doesn’t always merit a discussion. Sometimes it even detracts from the discussion. That is not the case when it comes to Andrew Ryan. 

>	Also, where did he defend Hitler…?

Alright, I’ll admit I misinterpreted one their comments.
        Ah, now I understand you. Yes, I would agree with all of your points then :) Sorry to drag this on for so long, but thanks for humoring me.
because root words = definition
    Yes. Words mean what they mean. That’s why root words exist. That’s how you know “hydrotherapy” means “water therapy” or how you know “Annual” is derived from the Latin Anno meaning year or how Dominion and Dominance both come from the Latin Dominus meaning Lord
        “Words mean what they mean”

Yeah, and what they mean is not tied to the letters that form them. This is such a strange argument to make considering there are hundreds of words whose meanings differ than their roots. Especially for a word like communism which comes from a word meaning “for the community” and not “a collectivist society” or whatever you just pulled out of thin air.

Edit: literally in your own example, you say two words that come from “the lord” and yet have nothing to do with it now. You don’t seem to grasp how language works.
Marxism is deliberately anarchistic and rejects both hierarchy and statism. Lamb, by definition, is not a Marxist. Maybe, *maybe* a commentary on Stalinism's authoritarian collectivism and cult of personality, but certainly not in any way a valid critique of actual Marxism.
You do realise that’s how education works, right? No one is born knowing information
I'm literally taking a class on the soviet union, and WWI

The soviet union devolped large amounts of Human rights under the rule of Bolchevic. It was the first time women had complete equality. It wasn't until he died and Stalin came in power that the soviet union became a mess.
    Wonder how many women scholars would agree that women had complete equality in soviet russia.
        They did specify "before Stalin" which is fair enough.  During Stalin's rule and ever since after, Russia has been a human rights nightmare I don't think anyone would deny that.
        Original values were that people were people.
    yeah , and that's exactly the point. communism became a mess because it doesn't work. people will always mess it.
        Communism under an authoritarian government will never work because it’s an oppressive system. We’ve yet to see an example of democratic communism
yes and if the kits work very well the doctors dont have much to do and likely move on to do things the kits cant do

more complicated operations.therapies would likely still require manual applications (including ADAM)

we are talking about costs of medi-kits not doctor treatments

$20 in a vending machine ...

you think a shop in NORMAL Rapture has it for the same price ?

if you can easily buy it in a shop then you dont in a machine 

machines aspect is being convenient which in our world people are willing to pay the premium price for (or the machines wouldnt exist)
    A quote from the first thing I said here.

"...it would have revolutionized healthcare for such a low price as to have put doctors out of business aside from specialists and top surgeons. Your average GP would be screwed with health stations in very convenient locations..."

You're literally repeating what I said earlier while making baseless speculations on prices, and to my knowledge there was only one company making medkits to begin with. I feel like you're intentionally trying to argue at this point so I won't bother responding to you anymore, you're going in circles at this point.

Yep. That’s u/premer777 for you. They look at Rapture and say “hey, this is a good idea. That Andrew Ryan is a pretty swell fellow.” 

Welcome to the wonderful world of Ryan fanboys.
        except Im trying to get thru to you that your $20 price out of a machine may : during a chaos world dystopia  ISNT THE SAME as when its in  NORMAL Rapture and when sold in shops (and with likely multiple manufacturers) .

you seem to be the one going off on tangents irrelevant to that point
