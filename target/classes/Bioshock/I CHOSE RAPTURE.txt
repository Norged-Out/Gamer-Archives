[[I CHOSE RAPTURE]]





Is Jeff Bezos not entitled to the sweat of his brow?

        No

- man in the Vatican
            No, it belongs to everyone
   -man in moscow
                I rejected those answers.
                    Instead I chose something different... I chose the impossible... I chose RAPTURE!
    *** sweat of his workers brow‚Äôs
        shhh, dont tell that to ryan or you'll end up in persephone
        Thank you
        I don‚Äôt remember seeing his workers take the risk, all j saw was the workers agreeing to work a job for a pre-agreed price.
            As apposed to what starving and not having a job?
    No,says the man in san jose 'It belongs to ebay'.
    Yes 

- Man in Washington
    "No," says Jeff Bezos, "it belongs to the Elder God Arak'Natu, to whom I sacrifice my quarterly earnings"
    Sweat of everyone else's brows*
Flooded?
    We're getting there. Just give us a bit more time
    Preparing for the future
    I rejected all those answers.
    climate change is coming üòÇ
        time to buy stock in that company that builds giant domes for cities ....
        What if the game only got the century wrong and Rapture will be here in 2056?
            I always thought technicwise it‚Äòs really futuristic
Am I the only one who remembered what a shithole Rapture was? A city at the bottom of the sea is just a bad idea all around, as all the Audio diaries pointed out. The thing that made Rapture truly special is the presence of Adam which doesn‚Äôt exist.
    If you came away from the game thinking being underwater was Rapture's biggest problem, I think you missed an audio diary or two.
        No, but the location definitely played a significant role in the downfall of Rapture.
            It certainly didn't help, but it only accelerated the inevitable.  Rapture on dry land would've gone the same way.
                I honest don‚Äôt think it would have gone down quite the same. Not imploded quite so spectacularly. The deep sea location enforced an intense isolationist policy and significantly increased the difficulty in smuggling and emigration. Not to mention the intense mental and physical rigors of *actually* living underwater. Plus we cannot ignore the influence of the under water slugs who produce the Adam which further mentally unhinges users.
                    They would have turned isolationist even without the deep sea city, the entire point of the city was to prove that pure capitalism without following other countries laws (and there fore sooner or later getting blocked from trading in those countries) and ideals.

Andrew Ryan where just Milton Friedman on super crack, not taking into account that you actually need to have some kind of government that is there to make sure that there actually is some kind of structure and blind justice.

What Ryan managed to create would have turned into something much, much worse if they never found Adam as Rapture most likely would had gotten a civil war like the one we see in Infinite, class warfare where something that where brewing before Adam as not everyone that lived in Rapture where rich
                        Except in Columbia you had the cronyism of the Founders, particularly Fink and some moronically absurd banking thing -- 50% Tithing taken on bank deposits.   The writers threw together so many contradicting extremes that the setting was patently impossible.

Ryan's philosophy allowed for competition where the free market equalized advantage if the writers ever were consistent when such things got in the way of their twist-forced plot
                            The problem with the writing is actually that it's System Shock but under water and with genetics instead of psyhonics with a lot of Neoliberalism thrown in for good mesure
                                I never played System Shock to make any comparison, though Ive heard alot of the elements are very similar.

Apparently the production of the original BioShock was changed significantly in its last year  after playtesting revealed major shortcomings.

The second BioShock game followed the first in concept and mechanisms, and I don't remember it being mentioned that they had any rush situations.  That ontop of also doing Multiplayer and then Minervas Den 

Infinite was significantly rewritten 2/3 times and huge chunks of effort were abandoned.   The game elements were similar, some missing, others simplified -- so that shouldn't have taken that much time away.   With the story/setting moved far further into Fantasy, I found it odd they continued to make believe it was a reflection of the Real World as the interviews claimed.    I saw no 'shock' that was supposed to change things, as the play was a Flying Reactionary Cult Compound from the start, and could have just as well been on the ground.   The Tears could have been 'the shock',  but weren't much utilized.

.
                                    The entire twist in Bioshock is the same as in System Shock, there are a lot of other things that are simular or identical, if I have to choose between SS and BS I will pick SS every day of the week as it's core concept is how corporate greed have twisted and made a hyper intelligent AI crazy only because the company that owns it wants to evade paying taxes
                                    >Infinite was significantly rewritten 2/3 times and huge chunks of effort were abandoned.   The game elements were similar, some missing, others simplified -- so that shouldn't have taken that much time away.

Tell me more!
    But it looked cool, and that's the beauty of it.
        And failed in *every other way.* People died, man.
            I meant like in aesthetic wise, it looks really good, so that's why people use it for examples of something looking good. Yes, it was a garbage can on fire, but the garbage can had a pretty coat of paint.
                Art deco looks cool. We have art deco.
                    Yeah but we don't have *underwater* art deco
                A pretty coat of pain which would have collapsed due to the pressure lol still looked nice though, loved the vibe the outside gave off
                    Yeah, me too.
                Isn‚Äôt that society in a nutshell though I mean either way you‚Äôre going to be told a lie you might as well have a pretty fucking city and it‚Äôs a joke honestly because either way the world would be shit but the meme is basically stating that Jeff Bezos is a materialistic person so he could make society look more aesthetic with all the money he has, however, it‚Äôll still be a society which ultimately ends in chaos.
            Yeah but they died looking cool
                I would call them ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù at this point. Not really cool anymore.
    I've actually looked into it a bit, and have found that technically we could build a sustainable underwater city if we had enough cash to do it. We have building technology that would easily survive deep water (not crazy deep, but deep enough), for extended periods. The most noticeable difference from Rapture would be that the external architecture (statues, signs, and edifaces) would need to be removed to cut down on structural pressure. The interiors could still have that art deco feel, but there would have to be either far smaller rooms or far more efficient ventilation systems. 

In short, we could have an underwater city, but we can not have "Rapture". At least not yet anyway.
        The tall buildings were artistic license. Unneeded height.  Just about every building we were ever in was squat and short. 

Statues and signs and edifices dont need pressure integrity.  

BUT More artistic license because all light is effectively gone through 150 feet of water and you would see very little out of any window except for things really close.
        When you think about it, though, Rapture's architecture being Art Deco is a pretty nice metaphor for the whole thing - An underwater city with Art Deco architecture is just as impossible as a city founded on objectivism, as the game shows us at length.
            With what architecture exactly would an underwater city that 'is possible' be built ??  

Art Deco represented a time long before now when the US had a society quite a bit closer to that objectivism in its operation.

You had neat Manhattan skylines of Fitzgeralds 20s golden city to wow you.
    And uninterrupted anarcho-capitalism
        It wasn‚Äôt really anarcho capitalism, which is kinda what lead to his downfall, Ryan‚Äôs a hypocrite
            Still very close
                But still so far away, which is kinda the point
            The writers made ryan and rapture that way to autofail.   Ready made dystopia for player gunfire and slaughter.

Consider Rapture ran from 1946 to 1958 pretty well.
An anarchistic city is an oxymoron.  
Modern large commerce under anarchy is an oxymoron.
                No, it‚Äôs not an oxymoron. Rapture just wasn‚Äôt anarchistic, you had Ryan‚Äôs committee or whatever it‚Äôs called that he ruled Rapture from
                    thats my point - it couldnt be an anarchistically run place.

a city cannot exist as anarchy,  thus Rapture couldnt be anarchy

detractors have to paint libertarianism as anarchy as their faulty argument to sway those who dont understand what's being talked about.

the writers might try to imply it, but it falls down on examination
    It might have been OK if LITERALLY EVERYONE didn't try to rewrite their DNA.
        For real.
            But if I can have the power to shoot fire or send attack bees, I'm gonna get on that.  Not to murder yall, just BC shooting fire is cool and the other is my favorite plasmid.
    You saw it after it was disrupted by terrorists empowered with insanity and magical abilities.    Ryan by the time of the first bioshock game was actually winning that war.

You dont have to be at the bottom of the sea for the same thing to happen to you.

Pandemic, solar flare, meteor strike, etc...  take your pick for the "shock" which will topple your so much more enlightened society.
        Rapture physically looked like a shithole following the Civil War and additional decline. All the various bits which lead into the Civil War (minus the Adam) is what made Rapture a shithole, as well.
            except the 'civil war' was a product of the ADAM    

remember all the poor people who couldnt compete if they didnt buy ADAM ?    Instability and uncertainty with this new destabilizing factor.

Remove it and the old ways you handled poverty would have worked.  Labor supply and demand separated from the End Of Construction depression the city seems to have largely survived already.   People change jobs all the time so that was ludicrously simplistic in the first place when the people there in Rapture were supposed to be go-getters already AND from the society of 70 years ago.
                Most of the citizens of Rapture were under constant mental strain from the utter lack of voice in their governing (Ryan‚Äôs word was pretty much was god‚Äôs word) and economics (Ryan Industries dominated the economy of the city). It was an incredibly isolated city with a total lack of reprieve, thanks to having absolutely no upward mobility. It‚Äôs the reason Ryan invited Sophia Lamb to Rapture, afterall. Lamb who made things worse. Lamb who was imprisoned in Persephone and continued to rule from there. 

There was gasoline all over Rapture already, before Adam was introduced. Adam was the match.
                    You assume first by what detractors said in audio diaries when we hardly heard anyone like the majority supporting Ryan.


What governing exactly did the people NOT have a voice in ??  The idea is they do their thing without much government.    Ryan's "I make one law" about smuggling - so he DIDNT make a whole lot of laws otherwise...
The society had rules you signed on to to even go to Rapture.  There were all THOSE laws already which people were expected to live by.


Who says Ryan Industries dominated the city ??  I saw lots of competition in all kinds of things.  You have to support your statement.
I figure he tapped many other millionaires to first even build Rapture and Thus THEY owned huge chunks of it also.  Everyone who went there would want to bring their surface wealth to position themselves.  So FAR more people than Ryan owned and 'ran' their own things.   Rights to your own property is part of libertarianism/objectivism. 


No, Sofia lamb was there to treat the cabin fever of people who werent used to being closed in by the environment - not the governance.  


No. ADAM was the thing that made the firefighting equipment not work.  The writers made sure that all the counter-balances checks and balances within Raptures objectivist and libertarian  society WERE NOT THERE to be allowed to work to set up their auto-fail dystopia .

        I absolutely love Rapture, but I am not wearing ocean-colored glasses. Rapture is a complete and utter shithole, right up until the third tyrant who ruled blew it up and dropped it into a trench.
    ‚ÄúIt was not impossible to build rapture at the bottom of the sea. It was impossible to build it anywhere else.‚Äù-A. Ryan
        >	‚ÄúIt was not impossible to build rapture at the bottom of the sea. It was impossible to build it anywhere else.‚Äù-A. Ryan

If he had put even a modicum of deeper thought into it, Ryan would have chosen a much better location.
Is (Jeff Bezos)  not entitled to the sweat of his brow? 'No!' says the man in Washington ‚Äòbelongs to the poor‚Äô - Andrew Ryan
If everybody didn't paid taxes*
    Like seriously, this guy totally missed the point of Rapture lmao
        Yeah, we should definitely be more like rapture, ayn Rand is right! We should all just be not poor!
            Do you think Rapture was presented as an exceptionally good idea that had no flaws?
                This was intended as sarcasm but I figure include /s. Probably should've
    Everyone seems to think the message was "economic freedom bad, government good", where the real message is the more complicated "absolute power corrupts absolutely".
You could not have missed the point more if it flew over your head while you were sleeping. Rapture is a terrible place, trapping people in an underwater hell city where the rich run rampant. This would be like if Amazon not only didn‚Äôt pay taxes but also actively made laws.
    Or it‚Äôs just a meme
        And I get that but it just doesn‚Äôt make sense
            It does. The idea is that it looks cool on the surface. People are just overthinking this way too much lol.
                That‚Äôs fair. It‚Äôs just hard not to overthink it when it‚Äôs kinda the whole point of the first two games
                It's kind of like saying "oh this is a cool fucking cartoon, love the artwork" and then thinking if only real life was like this.  Kinda pointless really...
    No shit
But [Amazon does pay taxes](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/live-updates/general-election/fact-checking-the-second-democratic-debate/does-amazon-pay-any-taxes/?arc404=true). From 2012 to 2018, they payed 1.9 billion dollars in taxes out of it's 25.4 billion profit. That's an 8% tax rate. They payed no federal income tax in 2019, but they payed other types of taxes, including corporate tax.
    How much of their company is covered by stock ownership ?

Stockholders would pay for that fraction of any profits, no ?
        Sorry. I don't understand the question.
            actual statistic   X profit is BEFORE or After dividends are paid to the stockholders ... (who pay the tax on the 'profit')
                The question doesn't make sense. Dividends **are** the profit. The company pays taxes on the profit, then it distributes part of the profit as dividends.
                    the point is they are NOT 'taxes paid by Amazon'

my question is the statistics you gave reflecting having a big chunk of the company profits NOT having 'taxes' paid by the company

It (those dividends) is something someone who wants to exaggerate the 'taxes that Amazon doesnt pay' (as in not paying their 'fair share')  does not include to specify when they compare numbers with the simple income of the company
I love it when libertarians/objectivists play Bioshock and they don't catch any hint of how the game points out the fallacies in the ideology. 

Yeah, Tax the rich. Take Ryan's forest and make it into a park. Ryan is a fucking dinguini
    It's also a big "fuck you" to Ayn Rand's nonsensical political ideologies.
        Ayn Rand is the Nickelback of anarchism
            does nickelback hate rock?

>Anarchy, as a political concept, is a naive floating abstraction: .¬†.¬†. a society without an organized government would be at the mercy of the first criminal who came along and who would precipitate it into the chaos of gang warfare.   
>  
>\-Ayn Rand
                Have you heard any of their songs? Cause i'm pretty sure they do
            That‚Äôs an insult to Nickelback.
                And anarchism

                I'm not a lib. I was trying to see how far i could go in this sub before anyone commented on my mistake.

It's been 11 hours, currently sitting at 26 upvotes, and only 3 PEOPLE corrected me. That proves my point lol
                    So in other words, you are a troll.
            Aynd Rand is not even a anarchist lmao what are you people going on about

You guys are way off the goop, both by thinking that bioshock is a comprehensive and deep critique of objectivism while in reality it's message is really shallow (if the state doesn't regulate drugs, people will become a bunch of fiends!!!) and by completely mischaracterizing ayn rand's so roughly

Nobody on this thread has read even ayn rand's Wikipedia article and it shows
                Fucking thank you. Jesus people are so first  level. The anti objectivism view is literally on the fuckin surface.
                Bioshock is not even a critique of objectivism. It's a critique of human nature. People in Rapture weren't following the objectivist morality. Everyone was a bunch of hypocrites.

                        Hey, Jackass. Why don't you listen to the [creator of the game himself](https://www.shacknews.com/article/48728/ken-levine-on-bioshock-the) ?

>*Shack:  The plot really has a  major dynamic shift from Ryan to Fontaine in the last third of the game.   Is that part of a suggestion that it's not the philosophy that's  fundamentally at fault as much as a failure of all its participants to  play along?*

>  
>*Fontaine is the only real monster in the game, because he has no  ideals at all, and all Ryan has is ideal.  I play with this a lot in all  the games I do, whether it's back to Thief where you have the pagans  and the fundamentalists, and you feel sort of in the middle.  I think  Fontaine's an empty human.  That's what happens when you have nothing.*  

You are the radical here. I'm not an objectivist. I'm a moderate libertarian, or centrist who leans libertarian. You are an anarchic communist. Bioshock 2 has a critique for you too, buddy.
                            I wish I could upvote this more. A dev with a skin deep understanding of Rand's ideas like in this sub would not have been able to represent it so well, with as much nuance. Plus what, it was the 00s, the subject matter wasn't remotely as offensive as it is now. I've read her shit several times but still ride the fence on a lot of it, but it is conceptually fascinating. I loved the game, bc i saw way, way more than "freedom=bad". The larger takeaway seemed to me to be "absolute power corrupts absolutely" but I like that point about Fontaine not having ideals. I'll have to play through again now with that in mind
                                I think the game also tries to make you ride the fence on the subject. Despite Ryan being a villain, he is not the main villain and you can understand his actions. He did what he did to protect the city. 

And Rapture does seem like an awesome place to live (before the war of course), it's no wonder the city sticks in our head. A fictional place that is real in our mind (like Middle Earth, for example). 

You can understand the characters's decisions. And the story is written in such a way that any decision they took would lead to ruin, one way or the other. It is a tragic story.
                                    It's excellent and complicated. They did a phenomenal job. Especially with the first one.
                Nah man, it's cool because people taking this seriously are as dumb as the people getting riled up. Besides, it's not like anyone in here gives enough of a fuck about Rand to know about her lmao just smile and wave, boys
            r/rareinsults

Not wrong though
                LOOK AT THIS ATLAS

EVERYTIME I DO IT MAKES ME SHRUG
            Now, now, aren't we insulting Nickelback there?

Have read some of Rand's stuff (because it is considered as almost a holy book by neo-cons), it is a .... challenge. I cannot imagine any such society being sustainable.
        Nah, it's not. [Ken Levine said it himself](https://www.shacknews.com/article/48728/ken-levine-on-bioshock-the):

>Ken Levine:  I'm fascinated by  Objectivism.  I think I gave it--I think the problem with any philosophy  is that it's up to people to carry it out.  It could have been  Objectivism, it could have been anything.

            Death of the author
                We can discuss our interpretations. But I think the previous comments before mine were discussing author's intent.
                    The game serves perfectly as an example of why objectivism/utopian unregulated capitalism wouldn't work. Andrew (Ayn) Ryan (Rand) perfectly represents Ayn Rand herself including backstory, ideals and name and he is the cowardly villain in the game. The game also spewers you with capitalist and objectivist propaganda portrayed in a bad light. Ken Levine's single reply is literally the only thing pointing towards something else than a critique of objectivism
                        See, you have the superficial analysis that most players have. When you analise the story in depth, you see that is much more complicated than that. 

Ryan was a hypocrite. He banned trade and communication with the outside world. He nationalised Fontaine's Futuristics. He continued the Little Sister program (created by Fontaine) and he created the Big Daddy program. He even used pheromones to control the minds of splicers. 

He wasn't following his ideology, neither was any of the main characters. So the city couldn't have fallen due to objectivism or unregulated capitalism. Those weren't being followed. 

What lead to the city's downfall was the power struggle between Ryan and Fontaine/Atlas. Fontaine got rich through smuggling. Which was only possible due to Ryan banning trade with the surface. Atlas only "showed up" because Ryan needed Fontaine dead. Fontaine/Atlas was only capable of creating his army by using Fontaine's charities. 

None of this is the result of objectivist philosophy. The only thing that is, is the unregulated Adam. And even that is a fictional thing.

The game's genius storytelling serves to show us things are more complicated than they first seem. From the beginning of the game we are lead to believe that Ryan is the villain. Later we realize that he is not the main villain. Fontaine is. And Fontaine doesn't even believe in anything. Ryan is still a villain, but his actions are still understandable.
                            Quite the interesting analysis, and you defiently bring a lot of good points to the table, but for me, it still serves as a monument towards the imminent failure of all utopian ideologies, be it objectivism (bioshock 1), communism (bioshock 2) and whatever Colombia is (theocracy? Monarcy? Extreme Patriotism?)
                                >it still serves as a monument towards the imminent failure of all utopian ideologies

But it really is. That's what Ken Levine was trying to say.
                                    Yes, and bioshock 1 is for the imminent failure of Ayn Rand's nonsensical ideologies, also known as objectivism.
                            >  He banned trade and communication with the outside world.

what dont you get about 'secret city' ?

Google cold war  and atomic war if you want to understand the reasons for it all.
                                I know. That's why I said his actions were understandable.

        It's not even about building places like Rapture. The post is saying the US would be more advanced economically if Amazon paid taxes. Which is debatable at best.
    I think you missed the part where Andrew Ryan siezed Fontaines business and forced him to close, which is anti-libertarian ideology. Andrew Ryan played the role of government in the city which led to Raptures downfall. Bioshock is a criticism of Any Rands objectivism, but it is much more nuanced than what you have portrayed.
        that just shows that the concept of truly free economy is delusional. also, it is the lack of regulations  and government that led to the outbreak of Adam.
            lack of actual execution of the social contract by the writers upon the story 

game needed a dystopia, and rather heavy handly the writers forced one.
            But:

1. It wasn't just Adam that threw Rapture into chaos. It was first and foremost, the power struggle between Ryan and Atlas.
2. Adam is a fictional substance. Using Adam to argue in favor of regulations is a straw man fallacy.
                Remember before Atlas it was Fontaine doing things to undermine Ryan and Raptures philosophy.

Against ADAM all you needed was a free press , which is supposed to exist there and the right to know and be informed about the side effects of ADAM.  Competing newspapers would outdo each other covering the first few horror stories about its sideeffects.   Most people would hear about the insanity and would say NO WONT TOUCH IT.  Simple peer and consumer pressure even without government action would have a strong effect.   Thus ADAM minimized, no Fontaine fortune, no collapse of order and no game to shoot things up in.    

Notice that the writers needed the atlas terrorism war to force so many people to suddenly use ADAM  when it seems as the story goes to have minimal effect before that.    OR what I just outlined above would have happened and eliminated ADAM as a major thing nullifying the whole plot.
                    Yeah. I think a major flaw is that people wouldn't normally use Adam if they knew the side effects. People who choose to not use drugs, don't do it because they are illegal. They do it because of the side effects. But I think it kind of makes sense in the context of the civil war. It's an arms race and you need to survive.
                        Or you join the Rapture Militia get issued guns and not Plasmids, get organized and slaughter the Splicers.

If all else fails the Splicer bastions get closed off and their heat and air turned off til they are all dead.
                            But there were also civilians caught in the cross fire. People who needed to protect their business and their families. What are you gonna do when the whole city is in chaos and looting ?
                                in a terror warzone those things largely cease or move to subsistence and bunkerism.   They are NOT normal times.

Civilians? Who arent supporting Ryan and ORDER ?  Most would say "RYAN PLEASE kill all these terrorists!!!" and then join the militia, if anything just to protect themselves.  Ryan then secures the city section by section and wipes the anarchist/terrorist/rebels out.   By the time of Bioshock thats basically what had happened. Pheromone Control neutralized Atlas's army and he was hiding in his spiderhole.

BTW What exactly did Atlas offer that normal people would want?  Anarchy is not a basis for survival for the people in Rapture, and many of them went there to GET AWAY FROM the likes of Atlas.
                                    Yeah, you know. I was under the impression that the parts of the city we play in during the game are the parts that were cut off by Ryan. And the rest of the city is still functioning properly with people working and living their lives. 

But I'm not so sure of that. When Ryan decides to make the player kill him, it appears as if everything was already lost.
        That's because late stage libertarianism devolves into tyranny. Ryan bitched on and on about economic and civil freedom, but in the end, used the power of his monopoly  to opress others.

Andrew Ryan doesn't stick to what he says. He talks about the free market and the great chain, but when Fontaine starts to become the rival monopoly, instead of letting the free market decide the fate, and instead of using his power to invent better technologies than his rival, he instead plans to assasinate Fontaine, and take out the rival monopoly with brute force.

Libertarianism, in my opinion, is just not sustainable. It will almost always go the route of Statism. The free market just doesn't account for human emotions and human rights.

Of course, it is not only the objectivist ideology that dooms Rapture, but the ADAM that is unregulated because of it. 

I also don't quite understand why Ryan wants to halt the smuggling operations, either. I understand he is isolationist, but doesn't halting business like that violate his principles?

Tl:dr, Ryan is a hypocrite, and ADAM is a helluva drug.
            >I also don't quite understand why Ryan wants to halt the smuggling  operations, either. I understand he is isolationist, but doesn't halting  business like that violate his principles? 

Yes. It violates. But he thinks if the outside world knows about Rapture, the US or the USSR will try to destroy it. It's an example of why Ryan betrays his principles all the time. He is always doing it to protect the city. It's genius story telling.

The critique wasn't on objectivism. It was on human nature and utopias in general.
                People keep calling it a 'utopia'.  Somewhere Ryan himself says that there will have to be adjustments made by the population to adapt away from that parasitic world they came from.  That doesn't sound like a utopia.   Rapture's and Ryan's philosophy was hardly absolutist.

Ryan and his principles, but doesnt he hold back again and again from interfering in the story: ADAM side effects,  Fontaine's business practices, not eliminating smuggling ... Then finally since nobody else seem inclined to do anything Ryan is the one who acts to save the city and gets blamed for "violating his philosophy" and is labeled a hypocrite.
            To be fair, however, in a free market no one would have the same power that Andrew Ryan held. Or at the least, if he did something such as asset seizure, likely the markets would decide that he is no longer worthy of their dollar, and stop supporting him. Because Andrew Ryan became an authoritarian of his pseudo-state, the markets ceased to trust him.

Andrew Ryan dealt in bad faith, and so the markets retaliated. Albeit, with violence and force rather than peaceful action.
                Almost as if "free market" is a moving goal post used to keep the wealthy in their position.
                    I‚Äôm not exactly sure what you mean by that, if you‚Äôd elaborate? If your saying that the wealthy define what a free market is in order to stay in power, I don‚Äôt think that holds up. A free market is a defined system regardless of what the wealthy say. However the wealthy will certainly do what they can to stay wealthy. In Andrew Ryan‚Äôs case, he got greedy. The competition scared him, so he used his power to put out the competition. This is acting in bad faith in a market; he went back on his contract with Fontaine (allowing Fontaine to do business in rapture) to which Fontaine retaliated.
                        Rhetorically people have used "free market" to justify not having taxes or regulation on their income/wealth/power. Ryan in Bioshock wanted to force people to not provide any charity. 

And the market in Bioshock certainly was not free as Ryan had a hand in everything and tried to crush competition along with banning media from the surface world. 

Without any rules, Rapture ended up a state with monopolies only, certainly not free. And with rules, many market actors would consider the market unfree as well.
                            I understand now. Anyway, my point is Bioshock was a lot more nuanced than just ‚Äúlibertarian bad.‚Äù It had a lot of interesting factors that led to the downfall of rapture, not just the free markets. Was it a criticism of Ayn Rand? 100%. But it was done in good faith and is an incredible game series.
                                I 100% agree with your statement. The inequality combined with a new technology released unfettered into the society was what I see the main reason why Rapture fell.
                            But Ryan didn't force people to not provide any charity. Fontaine had his charities. Ryan just didn't trust that because he thought it made people feel entitled and it could be used to manipulate people, which it did.
                >Andrew Ryan dealt in bad faith, and so the markets retaliated. Albeit, with violence and force rather than peaceful action. 

But that didn't happen though. The market didn't stop supporting him, everyone was still buying stuff from Ryan Industries. What happened was Atlas gathered a crowd of dissatisfied, brainwashed, adam junkie people to try to take over the city.
                    Ah yes you‚Äôre right. However, adam junkies still comprise part of the market.
                        And they were also killing random people for their Adam. I still don't see how that's the market self regulating in a positive way. And I say this as a moderate libertarian.
                            Its not a positive way. Lets not forget that Bioshock is a critical fiction, so the writers wrote the Splicers reaction. As a libertarian, I disagree that the markets would react in such a violent way. I was merely drawing the line that the Splicers were a part of the market. People often forget that Adam Smith‚Äôs ‚Äúinvisible hand of the market‚Äù are just people who participate in a market. The splicers participated, albeit in a violent way. I however, disagree that the markets would retaliate to such an extreme. It is likely rather that people would simply cease patronizing such a character as Andrew Ryan.
                                >Lets not forget that Bioshock is a critical fiction, so the writers wrote the Splicers reaction.

It's funny that you said that, because the critic Ken Levine had with Atlas Shrugged is that she can write whatever she wants. Characters behave perfectly in Gault's Gulch. 

Ken Levine asked himself "What if the characters weren't paragons but were instead, fallible people, just like in real life ?". 

Granted, he was thinking about Andrew Ryan, Fontaine, Tenenbaum, Sochong, etc. Characters that weren't following the objectivist ideology because of their greed, hubris and hypocrisy.  

The splicers were just the sci fi version of that. That is, how would someone follow an ideology of rational decision making if they are incapable of thinking rationally ?
                                    I never figured out in Atlas Shrugged how all that success in Galts Gulch was supposed to scale to an entire country.  People inclined to its social systems came there voluntarily, but outside are a whole lot of people who had the socialism ingrained in their lives and those beholden to it and very many would have to change from that to adopt the same objectivism.

Overcoming that inertia was to be the biggest problem.
        "Andrew Ryan seized Fontaines business"

They seize assets of criminal enterprises today

Historically the possessions of traitors were seized also.

There also was this minor issue of Fontaine Futuristics making most of the ADAM in Rapture and because of the addiction the stoppage of that production would send the addicts into craziness and insanity you hope you never ever see. Its Ryans city and he doesnt want to see it destroyed that way.  Who would run that company with Fontaine gone?   He did not seem someone to cultivate competent lieutenants and had no family  anything futher is barely mention as the logic contradicts the events they laid out.

The story was really a writer set up, with ryan getting the blame all so suddenly when ADAM had been poisoning citizens for years and nobody, including a free press, ever seemed to notice or blame Fontaine for peddling poison.  No lawsuits, no denounciation no relatives firing shotguns into his face for their familymembers Fontaine poisoned.
    What fallacies ? Ryan was a hypocrite. Ryan blocked trade with the outside world, that's how Fontaine got rich (through smuggling). Ryan killed Fontaine and nationalized his company, that's how Atlas showed up.
    I love how anti-libertarians play Bioshock and they dont catch any hint of how the game points out that Andrew Ryan is a Fascist draping himself with the aesthetic of Libertarianism. 

Andrew Ryan actively controlled what businesses could and could not thrive. He separated the population into the ‚Äòmaster race‚Äô of people who could make him rich and the ‚Äòparasites‚Äô of people who he demeaned useless. He controlled the market by force, literally killing those who opposed him. Hell, his face is literally the first thing you see inside the lighthouse, the first thing you read is his creed. 

The only thing he was missing was a goose-stepping army walking down main street.
        And he also had a strangled-hold on who could and could not leave! He turned a guy into a Big Daddy just because the guy found his way to Rapture on his own!
            > he also had a strangled-hold on who could and could not leave


Nobody could leave.  You went to Rapture understanding that.
            Mark Metzler turned Big Daddy was a Sophia Lamb move, not Ryan.
                I was referring to Johnny Topside, a.k.a. Subject Delta. He made it to Rapture in a (possibly stolen I think) deep sea diving suit, Ryan didnt like it, Johnny Topside ‚ÄúVolunteered‚Äù for the protector program.
                    Its never explained when that happened.

Gathering and protectors should not have existed or needed to exist before the terrorist attacks by atlas and his rebels started making huge piles of citizens corpses available. 

It was Fontaine who created the slug hosts using children which was kept secret from the population and Ryan.    Seems a hard thing to keep secret in such a small place and Ryan would be running to use such a thing against Fontaine, his rival, dont you think?  Same for the poisonous effect ADAM had on people, amazingly kept hidden or ignored when Ryan would want such city destroying factors exposed.
        Actually Ryan wasn't a fascist. A authoritarian tyrant, a slaver, a mass murderer, a monster, a bald faced liar, hypocrite and a narcissist. But not a fascist. (Getting a good definition of fascism is actually very hard!) The one area Ryan fails the definition is that fascists are all about sacrificing the good of the individual for the good of the nation. Ryan was about everything for himself. I guess it's all fascists regimes authoritarian, but not all authoritarians are fascists. sm
            Ryan talks constantly about the ‚ÄúGreat Chain of Society‚Äù and how all must pull on it, or at least all who are useful. Ryan saw his own wealth and success as proof of society being improved.
                And ONLY his own wealth. When someone else threatened his position he turned tyrant really fast. Ryan only loved his libertarian ideas when he thought they benefited him personally. sm
                Actually the Great Chain is where some few, from their merit and effort, pull the chain forward for everyone (who are on it in that society).   And recognizing that the chain moves most when more people pull and move it ahead, THEN having the society organized to GET OUT OF THOSE PEOPLES WAY benefits everyone the most.

Parasites dont just NOT pull on The Chain, they impede others trying to pull it forward.
    Not defending objectivism, but I think it‚Äôs pretty obvious you can‚Äôt test whether an ideology actually works with a fictional story. Or you can just shape the story to prove whatever point you want. Besides Ken Levine literally said it wasn‚Äôt a critique of objectivism and they only used the philosophy as a means of creating the back drop. I believe he even admitted to enjoying Ayn Rands works.
        Unfortunately having absurdities as a backdrop creates doubt if you want the players to empathize.  Story was allegedly what is supposed to set this game apart and normalism, at least of a world 70 years ago, was to be the foil for the 'Shock'  of the ADAM element which the player is supposed to project into THEIR normal lives.
    The fact that Ryan burned down a forest when the US government wanted to turn it into a park despite the fact that they actually would've paid him fair market value for it, and he could've bought another forest if he wanted to, really says *everything* you need to say about Ryan's character.
        "Planting Arcadia"
Ryan : "On the surface, I once bought a forest.  The Parasites claimed that the land belonged to God, and demanded that I establish a public park there.  Why ? So the rabble could stand slack jawed under the canopy and pretend that it was paradise earned.  When Congress moved to nationalize my forest,  I burnt it to the ground.  God did not plant the seeds of this Arcadia;  I did."

Where did you get this  'fair market value' ?   The government usually doesn't do that .

'Large' ?  where did you get that ? 

You need to base your argument on something actually in the game.
            Because the US Constitution prohibits the government from just seizing private property. And I never said ‚Äúlarge.‚Äù
                Eminent Domain
The power to take private property for public use by a state, municipality, or private person or corporation authorized to exercise functions of public character, following the payment of just compensation to the owner of that property.

Unfortunately 'just' is whatever the government involved says it is and NOT what the owner thinks.   THUS 'seized' (frequently with a token payment to be 'legal'

ALSO As I said, criminals very frequently have their assets seized when they are the product of crimes committed and as compensation for the crimes.  Strange contradition : that Ryan goes chapter and verse with Langford but no such legal-eaglism is invoke in Ryan's defence for the Agreements all people who came to Rapture would have signed.  The writes selected whatever fit their narrative.
    The fallacies are simple writer contrivance.

The check and balances that a libertarians/objectivists society has were NOT allowed to operate.

BTW the thing that made Rapture fail was the bio shock. That is the insanity ADAM caused, again magically suddenly with no normal societal mechanisms were allowed by the writers that would have stopped it.   

If our nice surface world was subjected to the same threat it would collapse even faster.
You realize rapture was formed to be tax free right?

The imaginary city of rapture goes against everything you just suggested.
    user fees for everything
        If people want to charge others for their services, they are free to do so.
            yes but its not 'government tax'


a debate might be how much of Rapture Ryan owns and thus gets rent from and is expected like any landlord to keep up the property from those collected moneys.

            I'm assuming that's a typo because 'sweat of his brown' sounds like diarrhoea
    Churches are non-profits
        Correct, churches are non profits. The problem is, they're not held to the same standard that non religious non profit organizations.  They dont have to demonstrate that they are a benefit to the community, it's just assumed while other non-profits have to demonstrate their benefit to the community, and they dont have to open their books to the public. How much of the money that you donate to a church or religious non-profit will go to where they say it goes? You have no idea because they arent required to open their books to the public.
            many non-church 'charities' have a tiny fraction of the collected money go to the actual intended benefit and THEY do supposedly have their 'books open'.    If you GO to the church you generally SEE the benefits in action.
                Really? Can you point me towards where I can find information on the "many" non church charities not put money they have collected to the intended benefit..., then compair that to the number of religious organizations who have done the same... but you cant because churches dont have their books open to the public....and yea, if you go to a church you can see the benefits in action... but the problem is they are not supposed to be only benefiting themselfs... they need to demonstrate they are a benefit to the community, not just a benefit to those who show up every sunday and line the churches pickets with unregulated money...also, you say that non church charities "supposedly" have their books open...what do you mean by that. Because by law they have to. If they dont, then they dont deserve non profit status
                    you are behind the times, the government started tracking church books decades ago into having to prove what the 'non-profit' money was being spent on.

Supposedly 'fund raising activities' which are basically a big party and high life for the people running the 'charity'

If you have a local PBS channel go investigate how much the people running the station are paying themselves.  You might be shocked.
                        I reccomend just doing a basic google search... I came across a page from the IRS website (updated in 2019 so it's not old news and I'm not behind on the times...) that literally describes how churches and religious non profits are exempt from opening their books to the public, and are not required to file a form 990... another page on the irs website even lists Special Rules Limiting IRS Authority to Audit a Church...
    I‚Äôm all for taxing the shit out of the church.
    It's been a very profitable venture, these last couple hundred years have been good to them lol.
Someone wasnt listening to Andrew Ryan.  Taxation just goes to more bureaucrats and waste .  You know, those Parasites he was always talking about.
I wonder what the US would look like if the rich in general paid taxes

The blame for this should rightfully go to Deloitte, Ernst & Young, KPMG, and PricewaterhouseCoopers
Amazon pays taxes, cuts job and raises prices to offset the cost of the taxes, homeless number rise, people are forced to steal to eat, crime rate rises, Amazon goes out of business along with all the other businesses, world turns on themselves, mad Max becomes a documentary.

    What if the game only got the century wrong and Rapture will be here in 2056?
        I always thought technicwise it‚Äòs really futuristic
If you came away from the game thinking being underwater was Rapture's biggest problem, I think you missed an audio diary or two.
    No, but the location definitely played a significant role in the downfall of Rapture.
        It certainly didn't help, but it only accelerated the inevitable.  Rapture on dry land would've gone the same way.
            I honest don‚Äôt think it would have gone down quite the same. Not imploded quite so spectacularly. The deep sea location enforced an intense isolationist policy and significantly increased the difficulty in smuggling and emigration. Not to mention the intense mental and physical rigors of *actually* living underwater. Plus we cannot ignore the influence of the under water slugs who produce the Adam which further mentally unhinges users.
                They would have turned isolationist even without the deep sea city, the entire point of the city was to prove that pure capitalism without following other countries laws (and there fore sooner or later getting blocked from trading in those countries) and ideals.

&#x200B;

Andrew Ryan where just Milton Friedman on super crack, not taking into account that you actually need to have some kind of government that is there to make sure that there actually is some kind of structure and blind justice.

What Ryan managed to create would have turned into something much, much worse if they never found Adam as Rapture most likely would had gotten a civil war like the one we see in Infinite, class warfare where something that where brewing before Adam as not everyone that lived in Rapture where rich
                    Except in Columbia you had the cronyism of the Founders, particularly Fink and some moronically absurd banking thing -- 50% Tithing taken on bank deposits.   The writers threw together so many contradicting extremes that the setting was patently impossible.

Ryan's philosophy allowed for competition where the free market equalized advantage if the writers ever were consistent when such things got in the way of their twist-forced plot
                        The problem with the writing is actually that it's System Shock but under water and with genetics instead of psyhonics with a lot of Neoliberalism thrown in for good mesure
                            I never played System Shock to make any comparison, though Ive heard alot of the elements are very similar.

Apparently the production of the original BioShock was changed significantly in its last year  after playtesting revealed major shortcomings.

The second BioShock game followed the first in concept and mechanisms, and I don't remember it being mentioned that they had any rush situations.  That ontop of also doing Multiplayer and then Minervas Den 

Infinite was significantly rewritten 2/3 times and huge chunks of effort were abandoned.   The game elements were similar, some missing, others simplified -- so that shouldn't have taken that much time away.   With the story/setting moved far further into Fantasy, I found it odd they continued to make believe it was a reflection of the Real World as the interviews claimed.    I saw no 'shock' that was supposed to change things, as the play was a Flying Reactionary Cult Compound from the start, and could have just as well been on the ground.   The Tears could have been 'the shock',  but weren't much utilized.

.
                                The entire twist in Bioshock is the same as in System Shock, there are a lot of other things that are simular or identical, if I have to choose between SS and BS I will pick SS every day of the week as it's core concept is how corporate greed have twisted and made a hyper intelligent AI crazy only because the company that owns it wants to evade paying taxes
                                >Infinite was significantly rewritten 2/3 times and huge chunks of effort were abandoned.   The game elements were similar, some missing, others simplified -- so that shouldn't have taken that much time away.

        Yeah but they died looking cool
            I would call them ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù at this point. Not really cool anymore.
I've actually looked into it a bit, and have found that technically we could build a sustainable underwater city if we had enough cash to do it. We have building technology that would easily survive deep water (not crazy deep, but deep enough), for extended periods. The most noticeable difference from Rapture would be that the external architecture (statues, signs, and edifaces) would need to be removed to cut down on structural pressure. The interiors could still have that art deco feel, but there would have to be either far smaller rooms or far more efficient ventilation systems. 

In short, we could have an underwater city, but we can not have "Rapture". At least not yet anyway.
    The tall buildings were artistic license. Unneeded height.  Just about every building we were ever in was squat and short. 

Statues and signs and edifices dont need pressure integrity.  

BUT More artistic license because all light is effectively gone through 150 feet of water and you would see very little out of any window except for things really close.
    When you think about it, though, Rapture's architecture being Art Deco is a pretty nice metaphor for the whole thing - An underwater city with Art Deco architecture is just as impossible as a city founded on objectivism, as the game shows us at length.
        With what architecture exactly would an underwater city that 'is possible' be built ??  

Art Deco represented a time long before now when the US had a society quite a bit closer to that objectivism in its operation.

You had neat Manhattan skylines of Fitzgeralds 20s golden city to wow you.
And uninterrupted anarcho-capitalism
    It wasn‚Äôt really anarcho capitalism, which is kinda what lead to his downfall, Ryan‚Äôs a hypocrite
        Still very close
            But still so far away, which is kinda the point
        The writers made ryan and rapture that way to autofail.   Ready made dystopia for player gunfire and slaughter.

Consider Rapture ran from 1946 to 1958 pretty well.
An anarchistic city is an oxymoron.  
Modern large commerce under anarchy is an oxymoron.
            No, it‚Äôs not an oxymoron. Rapture just wasn‚Äôt anarchistic, you had Ryan‚Äôs committee or whatever it‚Äôs called that he ruled Rapture from
                thats my point - it couldnt be an anarchistically run place.

a city cannot exist as anarchy,  thus Rapture couldnt be anarchy

detractors have to paint libertarianism as anarchy as their faulty argument to sway those who dont understand what's being talked about.

the writers might try to imply it, but it falls down on examination
It might have been OK if LITERALLY EVERYONE didn't try to rewrite their DNA.
    For real.
        But if I can have the power to shoot fire or send attack bees, I'm gonna get on that.  Not to murder yall, just BC shooting fire is cool and the other is my favorite plasmid.
You saw it after it was disrupted by terrorists empowered with insanity and magical abilities.    Ryan by the time of the first bioshock game was actually winning that war.

You dont have to be at the bottom of the sea for the same thing to happen to you.

Pandemic, solar flare, meteor strike, etc...  take your pick for the "shock" which will topple your so much more enlightened society.
    Rapture physically looked like a shithole following the Civil War and additional decline. All the various bits which lead into the Civil War (minus the Adam) is what made Rapture a shithole, as well.
        except the 'civil war' was a product of the ADAM    

remember all the poor people who couldnt compete if they didnt buy ADAM ?    Instability and uncertainty with this new destabilizing factor.

Remove it and the old ways you handled poverty would have worked.  Labor supply and demand separated from the End Of Construction depression the city seems to have largely survived already.   People change jobs all the time so that was ludicrously simplistic in the first place when the people there in Rapture were supposed to be go-getters already AND from the society of 70 years ago.
            Most of the citizens of Rapture were under constant mental strain from the utter lack of voice in their governing (Ryan‚Äôs word was pretty much was god‚Äôs word) and economics (Ryan Industries dominated the economy of the city). It was an incredibly isolated city with a total lack of reprieve, thanks to having absolutely no upward mobility. It‚Äôs the reason Ryan invited Sophia Lamb to Rapture, afterall. Lamb who made things worse. Lamb who was imprisoned in Persephone and continued to rule from there. 

There was gasoline all over Rapture already, before Adam was introduced. Adam was the match.
                You assume first by what detractors said in audio diaries when we hardly heard anyone like the majority supporting Ryan.


What governing exactly did the people NOT have a voice in ??  The idea is they do their thing without much government.    Ryan's "I make one law" about smuggling - so he DIDNT make a whole lot of laws otherwise...
The society had rules you signed on to to even go to Rapture.  There were all THOSE laws already which people were expected to live by.


Who says Ryan Industries dominated the city ??  I saw lots of competition in all kinds of things.  You have to support your statement.
I figure he tapped many other millionaires to first even build Rapture and Thus THEY owned huge chunks of it also.  Everyone who went there would want to bring their surface wealth to position themselves.  So FAR more people than Ryan owned and 'ran' their own things.   Rights to your own property is part of libertarianism/objectivism. 


No, Sofia lamb was there to treat the cabin fever of people who werent used to being closed in by the environment - not the governance.  


No. ADAM was the thing that made the firefighting equipment not work.  The writers made sure that all the counter-balances checks and balances within Raptures objectivist and libertarian  society WERE NOT THERE to be allowed to work to set up their auto-fail dystopia .

    I absolutely love Rapture, but I am not wearing ocean-colored glasses. Rapture is a complete and utter shithole, right up until the third tyrant who ruled blew it up and dropped it into a trench.
‚ÄúIt was not impossible to build rapture at the bottom of the sea. It was impossible to build it anywhere else.‚Äù-A. Ryan
    >	‚ÄúIt was not impossible to build rapture at the bottom of the sea. It was impossible to build it anywhere else.‚Äù-A. Ryan

If he had put even a modicum of deeper thought into it, Ryan would have chosen a much better location.
Like seriously, this guy totally missed the point of Rapture lmao
    Yeah, we should definitely be more like rapture, ayn Rand is right! We should all just be not poor!
        Do you think Rapture was presented as an exceptionally good idea that had no flaws?
            This was intended as sarcasm but I figure include /s. Probably should've
Everyone seems to think the message was "economic freedom bad, government good", where the real message is the more complicated "absolute power corrupts absolutely".
Or it‚Äôs just a meme
    And I get that but it just doesn‚Äôt make sense
        It does. The idea is that it looks cool on the surface. People are just overthinking this way too much lol.
            That‚Äôs fair. It‚Äôs just hard not to overthink it when it‚Äôs kinda the whole point of the first two games
            It's kind of like saying "oh this is a cool fucking cartoon, love the artwork" and then thinking if only real life was like this.  Kinda pointless really...
No shit
How much of their company is covered by stock ownership ?

Stockholders would pay for that fraction of any profits, no ?
    Sorry. I don't understand the question.
        actual statistic   X profit is BEFORE or After dividends are paid to the stockholders ... (who pay the tax on the 'profit')
            The question doesn't make sense. Dividends **are** the profit. The company pays taxes on the profit, then it distributes part of the profit as dividends.
                the point is they are NOT 'taxes paid by Amazon'

my question is the statistics you gave reflecting having a big chunk of the company profits NOT having 'taxes' paid by the company

It (those dividends) is something someone who wants to exaggerate the 'taxes that Amazon doesnt pay' (as in not paying their 'fair share')  does not include to specify when they compare numbers with the simple income of the company
It's also a big "fuck you" to Ayn Rand's nonsensical political ideologies.
    Ayn Rand is the Nickelback of anarchism
        does nickelback hate rock?

            Have you heard any of their songs? Cause i'm pretty sure they do

        Aynd Rand is not even a anarchist lmao what are you people going on about

You guys are way off the goop, both by thinking that bioshock is a comprehensive and deep critique of objectivism while in reality it's message is really shallow (if the state doesn't regulate drugs, people will become a bunch of fiends!!!) and by completely mischaracterizing ayn rand's so roughly

Nobody on this thread has read even ayn rand's Wikipedia article and it shows
            Fucking thank you. Jesus people are so first  level. The anti objectivism view is literally on the fuckin surface.
            Bioshock is not even a critique of objectivism. It's a critique of human nature. People in Rapture weren't following the objectivist morality. Everyone was a bunch of hypocrites.

You are the radical here. I'm not an objectivist. I'm a moderate libertarian, or centrist who leans libertarian. You are an anarchic communist. Bioshock 2 has a critique for you too, buddy.
                        I wish I could upvote this more. A dev with a skin deep understanding of Rand's ideas like in this sub would not have been able to represent it so well, with as much nuance. Plus what, it was the 00s, the subject matter wasn't remotely as offensive as it is now. I've read her shit several times but still ride the fence on a lot of it, but it is conceptually fascinating. I loved the game, bc i saw way, way more than "freedom=bad". The larger takeaway seemed to me to be "absolute power corrupts absolutely" but I like that point about Fontaine not having ideals. I'll have to play through again now with that in mind
                            I think the game also tries to make you ride the fence on the subject. Despite Ryan being a villain, he is not the main villain and you can understand his actions. He did what he did to protect the city. 

And Rapture does seem like an awesome place to live (before the war of course), it's no wonder the city sticks in our head. A fictional place that is real in our mind (like Middle Earth, for example). 

You can understand the characters's decisions. And the story is written in such a way that any decision they took would lead to ruin, one way or the other. It is a tragic story.
                                It's excellent and complicated. They did a phenomenal job. Especially with the first one.
            Nah man, it's cool because people taking this seriously are as dumb as the people getting riled up. Besides, it's not like anyone in here gives enough of a fuck about Rand to know about her lmao just smile and wave, boys

    Nah, it's not. [Ken Levine said it himself](https://www.shacknews.com/article/48728/ken-levine-on-bioshock-the):

        Death of the author
            We can discuss our interpretations. But I think the previous comments before mine were discussing author's intent.
                The game serves perfectly as an example of why objectivism/utopian unregulated capitalism wouldn't work. Andrew (Ayn) Ryan (Rand) perfectly represents Ayn Rand herself including backstory, ideals and name and he is the cowardly villain in the game. The game also spewers you with capitalist and objectivist propaganda portrayed in a bad light. Ken Levine's single reply is literally the only thing pointing towards something else than a critique of objectivism
                    See, you have the superficial analysis that most players have. When you analise the story in depth, you see that is much more complicated than that. 

Ryan was a hypocrite. He banned trade and communication with the outside world. He nationalised Fontaine's Futuristics. He continued the Little Sister program (created by Fontaine) and he created the Big Daddy program. He even used pheromones to control the minds of splicers. 

He wasn't following his ideology, neither was any of the main characters. So the city couldn't have fallen due to objectivism or unregulated capitalism. Those weren't being followed. 

What lead to the city's downfall was the power struggle between Ryan and Fontaine/Atlas. Fontaine got rich through smuggling. Which was only possible due to Ryan banning trade with the surface. Atlas only "showed up" because Ryan needed Fontaine dead. Fontaine/Atlas was only capable of creating his army by using Fontaine's charities. 

None of this is the result of objectivist philosophy. The only thing that is, is the unregulated Adam. And even that is a fictional thing.

The game's genius storytelling serves to show us things are more complicated than they first seem. From the beginning of the game we are lead to believe that Ryan is the villain. Later we realize that he is not the main villain. Fontaine is. And Fontaine doesn't even believe in anything. Ryan is still a villain, but his actions are still understandable.
                        Quite the interesting analysis, and you defiently bring a lot of good points to the table, but for me, it still serves as a monument towards the imminent failure of all utopian ideologies, be it objectivism (bioshock 1), communism (bioshock 2) and whatever Colombia is (theocracy? Monarcy? Extreme Patriotism?)
                            >it still serves as a monument towards the imminent failure of all utopian ideologies

But it really is. That's what Ken Levine was trying to say.
                                Yes, and bioshock 1 is for the imminent failure of Ayn Rand's nonsensical ideologies, also known as objectivism.
                        >  He banned trade and communication with the outside world.

what dont you get about 'secret city' ?

Google cold war  and atomic war if you want to understand the reasons for it all.
                            I know. That's why I said his actions were understandable.
[deleted]
    It's not even about building places like Rapture. The post is saying the US would be more advanced economically if Amazon paid taxes. Which is debatable at best.
I think you missed the part where Andrew Ryan siezed Fontaines business and forced him to close, which is anti-libertarian ideology. Andrew Ryan played the role of government in the city which led to Raptures downfall. Bioshock is a criticism of Any Rands objectivism, but it is much more nuanced than what you have portrayed.
    that just shows that the concept of truly free economy is delusional. also, it is the lack of regulations  and government that led to the outbreak of Adam.
        lack of actual execution of the social contract by the writers upon the story 

game needed a dystopia, and rather heavy handly the writers forced one.
        But:

1. It wasn't just Adam that threw Rapture into chaos. It was first and foremost, the power struggle between Ryan and Atlas.
2. Adam is a fictional substance. Using Adam to argue in favor of regulations is a straw man fallacy.
            Remember before Atlas it was Fontaine doing things to undermine Ryan and Raptures philosophy.

Against ADAM all you needed was a free press , which is supposed to exist there and the right to know and be informed about the side effects of ADAM.  Competing newspapers would outdo each other covering the first few horror stories about its sideeffects.   Most people would hear about the insanity and would say NO WONT TOUCH IT.  Simple peer and consumer pressure even without government action would have a strong effect.   Thus ADAM minimized, no Fontaine fortune, no collapse of order and no game to shoot things up in.    

Notice that the writers needed the atlas terrorism war to force so many people to suddenly use ADAM  when it seems as the story goes to have minimal effect before that.    OR what I just outlined above would have happened and eliminated ADAM as a major thing nullifying the whole plot.
                Yeah. I think a major flaw is that people wouldn't normally use Adam if they knew the side effects. People who choose to not use drugs, don't do it because they are illegal. They do it because of the side effects. But I think it kind of makes sense in the context of the civil war. It's an arms race and you need to survive.
                    Or you join the Rapture Militia get issued guns and not Plasmids, get organized and slaughter the Splicers.

If all else fails the Splicer bastions get closed off and their heat and air turned off til they are all dead.
                        But there were also civilians caught in the cross fire. People who needed to protect their business and their families. What are you gonna do when the whole city is in chaos and looting ?
                            in a terror warzone those things largely cease or move to subsistence and bunkerism.   They are NOT normal times.

Civilians? Who arent supporting Ryan and ORDER ?  Most would say "RYAN PLEASE kill all these terrorists!!!" and then join the militia, if anything just to protect themselves.  Ryan then secures the city section by section and wipes the anarchist/terrorist/rebels out.   By the time of Bioshock thats basically what had happened. Pheromone Control neutralized Atlas's army and he was hiding in his spiderhole.

BTW What exactly did Atlas offer that normal people would want?  Anarchy is not a basis for survival for the people in Rapture, and many of them went there to GET AWAY FROM the likes of Atlas.
                                Yeah, you know. I was under the impression that the parts of the city we play in during the game are the parts that were cut off by Ryan. And the rest of the city is still functioning properly with people working and living their lives. 

But I'm not so sure of that. When Ryan decides to make the player kill him, it appears as if everything was already lost.
    That's because late stage libertarianism devolves into tyranny. Ryan bitched on and on about economic and civil freedom, but in the end, used the power of his monopoly  to opress others.

Andrew Ryan doesn't stick to what he says. He talks about the free market and the great chain, but when Fontaine starts to become the rival monopoly, instead of letting the free market decide the fate, and instead of using his power to invent better technologies than his rival, he instead plans to assasinate Fontaine, and take out the rival monopoly with brute force.

Libertarianism, in my opinion, is just not sustainable. It will almost always go the route of Statism. The free market just doesn't account for human emotions and human rights.

Of course, it is not only the objectivist ideology that dooms Rapture, but the ADAM that is unregulated because of it. 

I also don't quite understand why Ryan wants to halt the smuggling operations, either. I understand he is isolationist, but doesn't halting business like that violate his principles?

Tl:dr, Ryan is a hypocrite, and ADAM is a helluva drug.
        >I also don't quite understand why Ryan wants to halt the smuggling  operations, either. I understand he is isolationist, but doesn't halting  business like that violate his principles? 

Yes. It violates. But he thinks if the outside world knows about Rapture, the US or the USSR will try to destroy it. It's an example of why Ryan betrays his principles all the time. He is always doing it to protect the city. It's genius story telling.

The critique wasn't on objectivism. It was on human nature and utopias in general.
            People keep calling it a 'utopia'.  Somewhere Ryan himself says that there will have to be adjustments made by the population to adapt away from that parasitic world they came from.  That doesn't sound like a utopia.   Rapture's and Ryan's philosophy was hardly absolutist.

Ryan and his principles, but doesnt he hold back again and again from interfering in the story: ADAM side effects,  Fontaine's business practices, not eliminating smuggling ... Then finally since nobody else seem inclined to do anything Ryan is the one who acts to save the city and gets blamed for "violating his philosophy" and is labeled a hypocrite.
        To be fair, however, in a free market no one would have the same power that Andrew Ryan held. Or at the least, if he did something such as asset seizure, likely the markets would decide that he is no longer worthy of their dollar, and stop supporting him. Because Andrew Ryan became an authoritarian of his pseudo-state, the markets ceased to trust him.

Andrew Ryan dealt in bad faith, and so the markets retaliated. Albeit, with violence and force rather than peaceful action.
            Almost as if "free market" is a moving goal post used to keep the wealthy in their position.
                I‚Äôm not exactly sure what you mean by that, if you‚Äôd elaborate? If your saying that the wealthy define what a free market is in order to stay in power, I don‚Äôt think that holds up. A free market is a defined system regardless of what the wealthy say. However the wealthy will certainly do what they can to stay wealthy. In Andrew Ryan‚Äôs case, he got greedy. The competition scared him, so he used his power to put out the competition. This is acting in bad faith in a market; he went back on his contract with Fontaine (allowing Fontaine to do business in rapture) to which Fontaine retaliated.
                    Rhetorically people have used "free market" to justify not having taxes or regulation on their income/wealth/power. Ryan in Bioshock wanted to force people to not provide any charity. 

And the market in Bioshock certainly was not free as Ryan had a hand in everything and tried to crush competition along with banning media from the surface world. 

Without any rules, Rapture ended up a state with monopolies only, certainly not free. And with rules, many market actors would consider the market unfree as well.
                        I understand now. Anyway, my point is Bioshock was a lot more nuanced than just ‚Äúlibertarian bad.‚Äù It had a lot of interesting factors that led to the downfall of rapture, not just the free markets. Was it a criticism of Ayn Rand? 100%. But it was done in good faith and is an incredible game series.
                            I 100% agree with your statement. The inequality combined with a new technology released unfettered into the society was what I see the main reason why Rapture fell.
                        But Ryan didn't force people to not provide any charity. Fontaine had his charities. Ryan just didn't trust that because he thought it made people feel entitled and it could be used to manipulate people, which it did.
            >Andrew Ryan dealt in bad faith, and so the markets retaliated. Albeit, with violence and force rather than peaceful action. 

But that didn't happen though. The market didn't stop supporting him, everyone was still buying stuff from Ryan Industries. What happened was Atlas gathered a crowd of dissatisfied, brainwashed, adam junkie people to try to take over the city.
                Ah yes you‚Äôre right. However, adam junkies still comprise part of the market.
                    And they were also killing random people for their Adam. I still don't see how that's the market self regulating in a positive way. And I say this as a moderate libertarian.
                        Its not a positive way. Lets not forget that Bioshock is a critical fiction, so the writers wrote the Splicers reaction. As a libertarian, I disagree that the markets would react in such a violent way. I was merely drawing the line that the Splicers were a part of the market. People often forget that Adam Smith‚Äôs ‚Äúinvisible hand of the market‚Äù are just people who participate in a market. The splicers participated, albeit in a violent way. I however, disagree that the markets would retaliate to such an extreme. It is likely rather that people would simply cease patronizing such a character as Andrew Ryan.
                            >Lets not forget that Bioshock is a critical fiction, so the writers wrote the Splicers reaction.

It's funny that you said that, because the critic Ken Levine had with Atlas Shrugged is that she can write whatever she wants. Characters behave perfectly in Gault's Gulch. 

Ken Levine asked himself "What if the characters weren't paragons but were instead, fallible people, just like in real life ?". 

Granted, he was thinking about Andrew Ryan, Fontaine, Tenenbaum, Sochong, etc. Characters that weren't following the objectivist ideology because of their greed, hubris and hypocrisy.  

The splicers were just the sci fi version of that. That is, how would someone follow an ideology of rational decision making if they are incapable of thinking rationally ?
                                I never figured out in Atlas Shrugged how all that success in Galts Gulch was supposed to scale to an entire country.  People inclined to its social systems came there voluntarily, but outside are a whole lot of people who had the socialism ingrained in their lives and those beholden to it and very many would have to change from that to adopt the same objectivism.

Overcoming that inertia was to be the biggest problem.
    "Andrew Ryan seized Fontaines business"

They seize assets of criminal enterprises today

Historically the possessions of traitors were seized also.

There also was this minor issue of Fontaine Futuristics making most of the ADAM in Rapture and because of the addiction the stoppage of that production would send the addicts into craziness and insanity you hope you never ever see. Its Ryans city and he doesnt want to see it destroyed that way.  Who would run that company with Fontaine gone?   He did not seem someone to cultivate competent lieutenants and had no family  anything futher is barely mention as the logic contradicts the events they laid out.

The story was really a writer set up, with ryan getting the blame all so suddenly when ADAM had been poisoning citizens for years and nobody, including a free press, ever seemed to notice or blame Fontaine for peddling poison.  No lawsuits, no denounciation no relatives firing shotguns into his face for their familymembers Fontaine poisoned.
What fallacies ? Ryan was a hypocrite. Ryan blocked trade with the outside world, that's how Fontaine got rich (through smuggling). Ryan killed Fontaine and nationalized his company, that's how Atlas showed up.
I love how anti-libertarians play Bioshock and they dont catch any hint of how the game points out that Andrew Ryan is a Fascist draping himself with the aesthetic of Libertarianism. 

Andrew Ryan actively controlled what businesses could and could not thrive. He separated the population into the ‚Äòmaster race‚Äô of people who could make him rich and the ‚Äòparasites‚Äô of people who he demeaned useless. He controlled the market by force, literally killing those who opposed him. Hell, his face is literally the first thing you see inside the lighthouse, the first thing you read is his creed. 

The only thing he was missing was a goose-stepping army walking down main street.
    And he also had a strangled-hold on who could and could not leave! He turned a guy into a Big Daddy just because the guy found his way to Rapture on his own!
        > he also had a strangled-hold on who could and could not leave


Nobody could leave.  You went to Rapture understanding that.
        Mark Metzler turned Big Daddy was a Sophia Lamb move, not Ryan.
            I was referring to Johnny Topside, a.k.a. Subject Delta. He made it to Rapture in a (possibly stolen I think) deep sea diving suit, Ryan didnt like it, Johnny Topside ‚ÄúVolunteered‚Äù for the protector program.
                Its never explained when that happened.

Gathering and protectors should not have existed or needed to exist before the terrorist attacks by atlas and his rebels started making huge piles of citizens corpses available. 

It was Fontaine who created the slug hosts using children which was kept secret from the population and Ryan.    Seems a hard thing to keep secret in such a small place and Ryan would be running to use such a thing against Fontaine, his rival, dont you think?  Same for the poisonous effect ADAM had on people, amazingly kept hidden or ignored when Ryan would want such city destroying factors exposed.
    Actually Ryan wasn't a fascist. A authoritarian tyrant, a slaver, a mass murderer, a monster, a bald faced liar, hypocrite and a narcissist. But not a fascist. (Getting a good definition of fascism is actually very hard!) The one area Ryan fails the definition is that fascists are all about sacrificing the good of the individual for the good of the nation. Ryan was about everything for himself. I guess it's all fascists regimes authoritarian, but not all authoritarians are fascists. sm
        Ryan talks constantly about the ‚ÄúGreat Chain of Society‚Äù and how all must pull on it, or at least all who are useful. Ryan saw his own wealth and success as proof of society being improved.
            And ONLY his own wealth. When someone else threatened his position he turned tyrant really fast. Ryan only loved his libertarian ideas when he thought they benefited him personally. sm
            Actually the Great Chain is where some few, from their merit and effort, pull the chain forward for everyone (who are on it in that society).   And recognizing that the chain moves most when more people pull and move it ahead, THEN having the society organized to GET OUT OF THOSE PEOPLES WAY benefits everyone the most.

Parasites dont just NOT pull on The Chain, they impede others trying to pull it forward.
Not defending objectivism, but I think it‚Äôs pretty obvious you can‚Äôt test whether an ideology actually works with a fictional story. Or you can just shape the story to prove whatever point you want. Besides Ken Levine literally said it wasn‚Äôt a critique of objectivism and they only used the philosophy as a means of creating the back drop. I believe he even admitted to enjoying Ayn Rands works.
    Unfortunately having absurdities as a backdrop creates doubt if you want the players to empathize.  Story was allegedly what is supposed to set this game apart and normalism, at least of a world 70 years ago, was to be the foil for the 'Shock'  of the ADAM element which the player is supposed to project into THEIR normal lives.
The fact that Ryan burned down a forest when the US government wanted to turn it into a park despite the fact that they actually would've paid him fair market value for it, and he could've bought another forest if he wanted to, really says *everything* you need to say about Ryan's character.
    "Planting Arcadia"
Ryan : "On the surface, I once bought a forest.  The Parasites claimed that the land belonged to God, and demanded that I establish a public park there.  Why ? So the rabble could stand slack jawed under the canopy and pretend that it was paradise earned.  When Congress moved to nationalize my forest,  I burnt it to the ground.  God did not plant the seeds of this Arcadia;  I did."

Where did you get this  'fair market value' ?   The government usually doesn't do that .

'Large' ?  where did you get that ? 

You need to base your argument on something actually in the game.
        Because the US Constitution prohibits the government from just seizing private property. And I never said ‚Äúlarge.‚Äù
            Eminent Domain
The power to take private property for public use by a state, municipality, or private person or corporation authorized to exercise functions of public character, following the payment of just compensation to the owner of that property.

Unfortunately 'just' is whatever the government involved says it is and NOT what the owner thinks.   THUS 'seized' (frequently with a token payment to be 'legal'

ALSO As I said, criminals very frequently have their assets seized when they are the product of crimes committed and as compensation for the crimes.  Strange contradition : that Ryan goes chapter and verse with Langford but no such legal-eaglism is invoke in Ryan's defence for the Agreements all people who came to Rapture would have signed.  The writes selected whatever fit their narrative.
The fallacies are simple writer contrivance.

The check and balances that a libertarians/objectivists society has were NOT allowed to operate.

BTW the thing that made Rapture fail was the bio shock. That is the insanity ADAM caused, again magically suddenly with no normal societal mechanisms were allowed by the writers that would have stopped it.   

If our nice surface world was subjected to the same threat it would collapse even faster.
user fees for everything
    If people want to charge others for their services, they are free to do so.
        yes but its not 'government tax'


a debate might be how much of Rapture Ryan owns and thus gets rent from and is expected like any landlord to keep up the property from those collected moneys.

Churches are non-profits
    Correct, churches are non profits. The problem is, they're not held to the same standard that non religious non profit organizations.  They dont have to demonstrate that they are a benefit to the community, it's just assumed while other non-profits have to demonstrate their benefit to the community, and they dont have to open their books to the public. How much of the money that you donate to a church or religious non-profit will go to where they say it goes? You have no idea because they arent required to open their books to the public.
        many non-church 'charities' have a tiny fraction of the collected money go to the actual intended benefit and THEY do supposedly have their 'books open'.    If you GO to the church you generally SEE the benefits in action.
            Really? Can you point me towards where I can find information on the "many" non church charities not put money they have collected to the intended benefit..., then compair that to the number of religious organizations who have done the same... but you cant because churches dont have their books open to the public....and yea, if you go to a church you can see the benefits in action... but the problem is they are not supposed to be only benefiting themselfs... they need to demonstrate they are a benefit to the community, not just a benefit to those who show up every sunday and line the churches pickets with unregulated money...also, you say that non church charities "supposedly" have their books open...what do you mean by that. Because by law they have to. If they dont, then they dont deserve non profit status
                you are behind the times, the government started tracking church books decades ago into having to prove what the 'non-profit' money was being spent on.

Supposedly 'fund raising activities' which are basically a big party and high life for the people running the 'charity'

If you have a local PBS channel go investigate how much the people running the station are paying themselves.  You might be shocked.
                    I reccomend just doing a basic google search... I came across a page from the IRS website (updated in 2019 so it's not old news and I'm not behind on the times...) that literally describes how churches and religious non profits are exempt from opening their books to the public, and are not required to file a form 990... another page on the irs website even lists Special Rules Limiting IRS Authority to Audit a Church...
I‚Äôm all for taxing the shit out of the church.
It's been a very profitable venture, these last couple hundred years have been good to them lol.
Next would be the minimized government as how could one run without a taxbase

Income tax versus luxury taxes, then thats something else.
Now it‚Äôs been a few years but I seem to recall that Frank Fontaine turned out to be an evil scumbag. I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs the best analogy to draw.

        Yeah but think how good jack turned out. Or how scummy. Either way Fontaine was a dick

What if the game only got the century wrong and Rapture will be here in 2056?
    I always thought technicwise it‚Äòs really futuristic
No, but the location definitely played a significant role in the downfall of Rapture.
    It certainly didn't help, but it only accelerated the inevitable.  Rapture on dry land would've gone the same way.
        I honest don‚Äôt think it would have gone down quite the same. Not imploded quite so spectacularly. The deep sea location enforced an intense isolationist policy and significantly increased the difficulty in smuggling and emigration. Not to mention the intense mental and physical rigors of *actually* living underwater. Plus we cannot ignore the influence of the under water slugs who produce the Adam which further mentally unhinges users.
            They would have turned isolationist even without the deep sea city, the entire point of the city was to prove that pure capitalism without following other countries laws (and there fore sooner or later getting blocked from trading in those countries) and ideals.

&#x200B;

Andrew Ryan where just Milton Friedman on super crack, not taking into account that you actually need to have some kind of government that is there to make sure that there actually is some kind of structure and blind justice.

What Ryan managed to create would have turned into something much, much worse if they never found Adam as Rapture most likely would had gotten a civil war like the one we see in Infinite, class warfare where something that where brewing before Adam as not everyone that lived in Rapture where rich
                Except in Columbia you had the cronyism of the Founders, particularly Fink and some moronically absurd banking thing -- 50% Tithing taken on bank deposits.   The writers threw together so many contradicting extremes that the setting was patently impossible.

Ryan's philosophy allowed for competition where the free market equalized advantage if the writers ever were consistent when such things got in the way of their twist-forced plot
                    The problem with the writing is actually that it's System Shock but under water and with genetics instead of psyhonics with a lot of Neoliberalism thrown in for good mesure
                        I never played System Shock to make any comparison, though Ive heard alot of the elements are very similar.

Apparently the production of the original BioShock was changed significantly in its last year  after playtesting revealed major shortcomings.

The second BioShock game followed the first in concept and mechanisms, and I don't remember it being mentioned that they had any rush situations.  That ontop of also doing Multiplayer and then Minervas Den 

Infinite was significantly rewritten 2/3 times and huge chunks of effort were abandoned.   The game elements were similar, some missing, others simplified -- so that shouldn't have taken that much time away.   With the story/setting moved far further into Fantasy, I found it odd they continued to make believe it was a reflection of the Real World as the interviews claimed.    I saw no 'shock' that was supposed to change things, as the play was a Flying Reactionary Cult Compound from the start, and could have just as well been on the ground.   The Tears could have been 'the shock',  but weren't much utilized.

.
                            The entire twist in Bioshock is the same as in System Shock, there are a lot of other things that are simular or identical, if I have to choose between SS and BS I will pick SS every day of the week as it's core concept is how corporate greed have twisted and made a hyper intelligent AI crazy only because the company that owns it wants to evade paying taxes
                            >Infinite was significantly rewritten 2/3 times and huge chunks of effort were abandoned.   The game elements were similar, some missing, others simplified -- so that shouldn't have taken that much time away.

Tell me more!
And failed in *every other way.* People died, man.
    I meant like in aesthetic wise, it looks really good, so that's why people use it for examples of something looking good. Yes, it was a garbage can on fire, but the garbage can had a pretty coat of paint.
        Art deco looks cool. We have art deco.
            Yeah but we don't have *underwater* art deco
        A pretty coat of pain which would have collapsed due to the pressure lol still looked nice though, loved the vibe the outside gave off
            Yeah, me too.
        Isn‚Äôt that society in a nutshell though I mean either way you‚Äôre going to be told a lie you might as well have a pretty fucking city and it‚Äôs a joke honestly because either way the world would be shit but the meme is basically stating that Jeff Bezos is a materialistic person so he could make society look more aesthetic with all the money he has, however, it‚Äôll still be a society which ultimately ends in chaos.
    Yeah but they died looking cool
        I would call them ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù at this point. Not really cool anymore.
The tall buildings were artistic license. Unneeded height.  Just about every building we were ever in was squat and short. 

Statues and signs and edifices dont need pressure integrity.  

BUT More artistic license because all light is effectively gone through 150 feet of water and you would see very little out of any window except for things really close.
When you think about it, though, Rapture's architecture being Art Deco is a pretty nice metaphor for the whole thing - An underwater city with Art Deco architecture is just as impossible as a city founded on objectivism, as the game shows us at length.
    With what architecture exactly would an underwater city that 'is possible' be built ??  

Art Deco represented a time long before now when the US had a society quite a bit closer to that objectivism in its operation.

You had neat Manhattan skylines of Fitzgeralds 20s golden city to wow you.
It wasn‚Äôt really anarcho capitalism, which is kinda what lead to his downfall, Ryan‚Äôs a hypocrite
    Still very close
        But still so far away, which is kinda the point
    The writers made ryan and rapture that way to autofail.   Ready made dystopia for player gunfire and slaughter.

Consider Rapture ran from 1946 to 1958 pretty well.
An anarchistic city is an oxymoron.  
Modern large commerce under anarchy is an oxymoron.
        No, it‚Äôs not an oxymoron. Rapture just wasn‚Äôt anarchistic, you had Ryan‚Äôs committee or whatever it‚Äôs called that he ruled Rapture from
            thats my point - it couldnt be an anarchistically run place.

a city cannot exist as anarchy,  thus Rapture couldnt be anarchy

detractors have to paint libertarianism as anarchy as their faulty argument to sway those who dont understand what's being talked about.

the writers might try to imply it, but it falls down on examination
For real.
    But if I can have the power to shoot fire or send attack bees, I'm gonna get on that.  Not to murder yall, just BC shooting fire is cool and the other is my favorite plasmid.
Rapture physically looked like a shithole following the Civil War and additional decline. All the various bits which lead into the Civil War (minus the Adam) is what made Rapture a shithole, as well.
    except the 'civil war' was a product of the ADAM    

remember all the poor people who couldnt compete if they didnt buy ADAM ?    Instability and uncertainty with this new destabilizing factor.

Remove it and the old ways you handled poverty would have worked.  Labor supply and demand separated from the End Of Construction depression the city seems to have largely survived already.   People change jobs all the time so that was ludicrously simplistic in the first place when the people there in Rapture were supposed to be go-getters already AND from the society of 70 years ago.
        Most of the citizens of Rapture were under constant mental strain from the utter lack of voice in their governing (Ryan‚Äôs word was pretty much was god‚Äôs word) and economics (Ryan Industries dominated the economy of the city). It was an incredibly isolated city with a total lack of reprieve, thanks to having absolutely no upward mobility. It‚Äôs the reason Ryan invited Sophia Lamb to Rapture, afterall. Lamb who made things worse. Lamb who was imprisoned in Persephone and continued to rule from there. 

There was gasoline all over Rapture already, before Adam was introduced. Adam was the match.
            You assume first by what detractors said in audio diaries when we hardly heard anyone like the majority supporting Ryan.


What governing exactly did the people NOT have a voice in ??  The idea is they do their thing without much government.    Ryan's "I make one law" about smuggling - so he DIDNT make a whole lot of laws otherwise...
The society had rules you signed on to to even go to Rapture.  There were all THOSE laws already which people were expected to live by.


Who says Ryan Industries dominated the city ??  I saw lots of competition in all kinds of things.  You have to support your statement.
I figure he tapped many other millionaires to first even build Rapture and Thus THEY owned huge chunks of it also.  Everyone who went there would want to bring their surface wealth to position themselves.  So FAR more people than Ryan owned and 'ran' their own things.   Rights to your own property is part of libertarianism/objectivism. 


No, Sofia lamb was there to treat the cabin fever of people who werent used to being closed in by the environment - not the governance.  


No. ADAM was the thing that made the firefighting equipment not work.  The writers made sure that all the counter-balances checks and balances within Raptures objectivist and libertarian  society WERE NOT THERE to be allowed to work to set up their auto-fail dystopia .
I absolutely love Rapture, but I am not wearing ocean-colored glasses. Rapture is a complete and utter shithole, right up until the third tyrant who ruled blew it up and dropped it into a trench.
>	‚ÄúIt was not impossible to build rapture at the bottom of the sea. It was impossible to build it anywhere else.‚Äù-A. Ryan

If he had put even a modicum of deeper thought into it, Ryan would have chosen a much better location.
Yeah, we should definitely be more like rapture, ayn Rand is right! We should all just be not poor!
    Do you think Rapture was presented as an exceptionally good idea that had no flaws?
        This was intended as sarcasm but I figure include /s. Probably should've
And I get that but it just doesn‚Äôt make sense
    It does. The idea is that it looks cool on the surface. People are just overthinking this way too much lol.
        That‚Äôs fair. It‚Äôs just hard not to overthink it when it‚Äôs kinda the whole point of the first two games
        It's kind of like saying "oh this is a cool fucking cartoon, love the artwork" and then thinking if only real life was like this.  Kinda pointless really...
Sorry. I don't understand the question.
    actual statistic   X profit is BEFORE or After dividends are paid to the stockholders ... (who pay the tax on the 'profit')
        The question doesn't make sense. Dividends **are** the profit. The company pays taxes on the profit, then it distributes part of the profit as dividends.
            the point is they are NOT 'taxes paid by Amazon'

my question is the statistics you gave reflecting having a big chunk of the company profits NOT having 'taxes' paid by the company

It (those dividends) is something someone who wants to exaggerate the 'taxes that Amazon doesnt pay' (as in not paying their 'fair share')  does not include to specify when they compare numbers with the simple income of the company
Ayn Rand is the Nickelback of anarchism
    does nickelback hate rock?

You guys are way off the goop, both by thinking that bioshock is a comprehensive and deep critique of objectivism while in reality it's message is really shallow (if the state doesn't regulate drugs, people will become a bunch of fiends!!!) and by completely mischaracterizing ayn rand's so roughly

Nobody on this thread has read even ayn rand's Wikipedia article and it shows
        Fucking thank you. Jesus people are so first  level. The anti objectivism view is literally on the fuckin surface.
        Bioshock is not even a critique of objectivism. It's a critique of human nature. People in Rapture weren't following the objectivist morality. Everyone was a bunch of hypocrites.

You are the radical here. I'm not an objectivist. I'm a moderate libertarian, or centrist who leans libertarian. You are an anarchic communist. Bioshock 2 has a critique for you too, buddy.
                    I wish I could upvote this more. A dev with a skin deep understanding of Rand's ideas like in this sub would not have been able to represent it so well, with as much nuance. Plus what, it was the 00s, the subject matter wasn't remotely as offensive as it is now. I've read her shit several times but still ride the fence on a lot of it, but it is conceptually fascinating. I loved the game, bc i saw way, way more than "freedom=bad". The larger takeaway seemed to me to be "absolute power corrupts absolutely" but I like that point about Fontaine not having ideals. I'll have to play through again now with that in mind
                        I think the game also tries to make you ride the fence on the subject. Despite Ryan being a villain, he is not the main villain and you can understand his actions. He did what he did to protect the city. 

And Rapture does seem like an awesome place to live (before the war of course), it's no wonder the city sticks in our head. A fictional place that is real in our mind (like Middle Earth, for example). 

You can understand the characters's decisions. And the story is written in such a way that any decision they took would lead to ruin, one way or the other. It is a tragic story.
                            It's excellent and complicated. They did a phenomenal job. Especially with the first one.
        Nah man, it's cool because people taking this seriously are as dumb as the people getting riled up. Besides, it's not like anyone in here gives enough of a fuck about Rand to know about her lmao just smile and wave, boys

Nah, it's not. [Ken Levine said it himself](https://www.shacknews.com/article/48728/ken-levine-on-bioshock-the):

>Ken Levine:  I'm fascinated by  Objectivism.  I think I gave it--I think the problem with any philosophy  is that it's up to people to carry it out.  It could have been  Objectivism, it could have been anything.

    Death of the author
        We can discuss our interpretations. But I think the previous comments before mine were discussing author's intent.
            The game serves perfectly as an example of why objectivism/utopian unregulated capitalism wouldn't work. Andrew (Ayn) Ryan (Rand) perfectly represents Ayn Rand herself including backstory, ideals and name and he is the cowardly villain in the game. The game also spewers you with capitalist and objectivist propaganda portrayed in a bad light. Ken Levine's single reply is literally the only thing pointing towards something else than a critique of objectivism
                See, you have the superficial analysis that most players have. When you analise the story in depth, you see that is much more complicated than that. 

Ryan was a hypocrite. He banned trade and communication with the outside world. He nationalised Fontaine's Futuristics. He continued the Little Sister program (created by Fontaine) and he created the Big Daddy program. He even used pheromones to control the minds of splicers. 

He wasn't following his ideology, neither was any of the main characters. So the city couldn't have fallen due to objectivism or unregulated capitalism. Those weren't being followed. 

What lead to the city's downfall was the power struggle between Ryan and Fontaine/Atlas. Fontaine got rich through smuggling. Which was only possible due to Ryan banning trade with the surface. Atlas only "showed up" because Ryan needed Fontaine dead. Fontaine/Atlas was only capable of creating his army by using Fontaine's charities. 

None of this is the result of objectivist philosophy. The only thing that is, is the unregulated Adam. And even that is a fictional thing.

The game's genius storytelling serves to show us things are more complicated than they first seem. From the beginning of the game we are lead to believe that Ryan is the villain. Later we realize that he is not the main villain. Fontaine is. And Fontaine doesn't even believe in anything. Ryan is still a villain, but his actions are still understandable.
                    Quite the interesting analysis, and you defiently bring a lot of good points to the table, but for me, it still serves as a monument towards the imminent failure of all utopian ideologies, be it objectivism (bioshock 1), communism (bioshock 2) and whatever Colombia is (theocracy? Monarcy? Extreme Patriotism?)
                        >it still serves as a monument towards the imminent failure of all utopian ideologies

But it really is. That's what Ken Levine was trying to say.
                            Yes, and bioshock 1 is for the imminent failure of Ayn Rand's nonsensical ideologies, also known as objectivism.
                    >  He banned trade and communication with the outside world.

what dont you get about 'secret city' ?

Google cold war  and atomic war if you want to understand the reasons for it all.
                        I know. That's why I said his actions were understandable.
It's not even about building places like Rapture. The post is saying the US would be more advanced economically if Amazon paid taxes. Which is debatable at best.
that just shows that the concept of truly free economy is delusional. also, it is the lack of regulations  and government that led to the outbreak of Adam.
    lack of actual execution of the social contract by the writers upon the story 

game needed a dystopia, and rather heavy handly the writers forced one.
    But:

1. It wasn't just Adam that threw Rapture into chaos. It was first and foremost, the power struggle between Ryan and Atlas.
2. Adam is a fictional substance. Using Adam to argue in favor of regulations is a straw man fallacy.
        Remember before Atlas it was Fontaine doing things to undermine Ryan and Raptures philosophy.

Against ADAM all you needed was a free press , which is supposed to exist there and the right to know and be informed about the side effects of ADAM.  Competing newspapers would outdo each other covering the first few horror stories about its sideeffects.   Most people would hear about the insanity and would say NO WONT TOUCH IT.  Simple peer and consumer pressure even without government action would have a strong effect.   Thus ADAM minimized, no Fontaine fortune, no collapse of order and no game to shoot things up in.    

Notice that the writers needed the atlas terrorism war to force so many people to suddenly use ADAM  when it seems as the story goes to have minimal effect before that.    OR what I just outlined above would have happened and eliminated ADAM as a major thing nullifying the whole plot.
            Yeah. I think a major flaw is that people wouldn't normally use Adam if they knew the side effects. People who choose to not use drugs, don't do it because they are illegal. They do it because of the side effects. But I think it kind of makes sense in the context of the civil war. It's an arms race and you need to survive.
                Or you join the Rapture Militia get issued guns and not Plasmids, get organized and slaughter the Splicers.

If all else fails the Splicer bastions get closed off and their heat and air turned off til they are all dead.
                    But there were also civilians caught in the cross fire. People who needed to protect their business and their families. What are you gonna do when the whole city is in chaos and looting ?
                        in a terror warzone those things largely cease or move to subsistence and bunkerism.   They are NOT normal times.

Civilians? Who arent supporting Ryan and ORDER ?  Most would say "RYAN PLEASE kill all these terrorists!!!" and then join the militia, if anything just to protect themselves.  Ryan then secures the city section by section and wipes the anarchist/terrorist/rebels out.   By the time of Bioshock thats basically what had happened. Pheromone Control neutralized Atlas's army and he was hiding in his spiderhole.

BTW What exactly did Atlas offer that normal people would want?  Anarchy is not a basis for survival for the people in Rapture, and many of them went there to GET AWAY FROM the likes of Atlas.
                            Yeah, you know. I was under the impression that the parts of the city we play in during the game are the parts that were cut off by Ryan. And the rest of the city is still functioning properly with people working and living their lives. 

But I'm not so sure of that. When Ryan decides to make the player kill him, it appears as if everything was already lost.
That's because late stage libertarianism devolves into tyranny. Ryan bitched on and on about economic and civil freedom, but in the end, used the power of his monopoly  to opress others.

Andrew Ryan doesn't stick to what he says. He talks about the free market and the great chain, but when Fontaine starts to become the rival monopoly, instead of letting the free market decide the fate, and instead of using his power to invent better technologies than his rival, he instead plans to assasinate Fontaine, and take out the rival monopoly with brute force.

Libertarianism, in my opinion, is just not sustainable. It will almost always go the route of Statism. The free market just doesn't account for human emotions and human rights.

Of course, it is not only the objectivist ideology that dooms Rapture, but the ADAM that is unregulated because of it. 

I also don't quite understand why Ryan wants to halt the smuggling operations, either. I understand he is isolationist, but doesn't halting business like that violate his principles?

Tl:dr, Ryan is a hypocrite, and ADAM is a helluva drug.
    >I also don't quite understand why Ryan wants to halt the smuggling  operations, either. I understand he is isolationist, but doesn't halting  business like that violate his principles? 

Yes. It violates. But he thinks if the outside world knows about Rapture, the US or the USSR will try to destroy it. It's an example of why Ryan betrays his principles all the time. He is always doing it to protect the city. It's genius story telling.

The critique wasn't on objectivism. It was on human nature and utopias in general.
        People keep calling it a 'utopia'.  Somewhere Ryan himself says that there will have to be adjustments made by the population to adapt away from that parasitic world they came from.  That doesn't sound like a utopia.   Rapture's and Ryan's philosophy was hardly absolutist.

Ryan and his principles, but doesnt he hold back again and again from interfering in the story: ADAM side effects,  Fontaine's business practices, not eliminating smuggling ... Then finally since nobody else seem inclined to do anything Ryan is the one who acts to save the city and gets blamed for "violating his philosophy" and is labeled a hypocrite.
    To be fair, however, in a free market no one would have the same power that Andrew Ryan held. Or at the least, if he did something such as asset seizure, likely the markets would decide that he is no longer worthy of their dollar, and stop supporting him. Because Andrew Ryan became an authoritarian of his pseudo-state, the markets ceased to trust him.

Andrew Ryan dealt in bad faith, and so the markets retaliated. Albeit, with violence and force rather than peaceful action.
        Almost as if "free market" is a moving goal post used to keep the wealthy in their position.
            I‚Äôm not exactly sure what you mean by that, if you‚Äôd elaborate? If your saying that the wealthy define what a free market is in order to stay in power, I don‚Äôt think that holds up. A free market is a defined system regardless of what the wealthy say. However the wealthy will certainly do what they can to stay wealthy. In Andrew Ryan‚Äôs case, he got greedy. The competition scared him, so he used his power to put out the competition. This is acting in bad faith in a market; he went back on his contract with Fontaine (allowing Fontaine to do business in rapture) to which Fontaine retaliated.
                Rhetorically people have used "free market" to justify not having taxes or regulation on their income/wealth/power. Ryan in Bioshock wanted to force people to not provide any charity. 

And the market in Bioshock certainly was not free as Ryan had a hand in everything and tried to crush competition along with banning media from the surface world. 

Without any rules, Rapture ended up a state with monopolies only, certainly not free. And with rules, many market actors would consider the market unfree as well.
                    I understand now. Anyway, my point is Bioshock was a lot more nuanced than just ‚Äúlibertarian bad.‚Äù It had a lot of interesting factors that led to the downfall of rapture, not just the free markets. Was it a criticism of Ayn Rand? 100%. But it was done in good faith and is an incredible game series.
                        I 100% agree with your statement. The inequality combined with a new technology released unfettered into the society was what I see the main reason why Rapture fell.
                    But Ryan didn't force people to not provide any charity. Fontaine had his charities. Ryan just didn't trust that because he thought it made people feel entitled and it could be used to manipulate people, which it did.
        >Andrew Ryan dealt in bad faith, and so the markets retaliated. Albeit, with violence and force rather than peaceful action. 

But that didn't happen though. The market didn't stop supporting him, everyone was still buying stuff from Ryan Industries. What happened was Atlas gathered a crowd of dissatisfied, brainwashed, adam junkie people to try to take over the city.
            Ah yes you‚Äôre right. However, adam junkies still comprise part of the market.
                And they were also killing random people for their Adam. I still don't see how that's the market self regulating in a positive way. And I say this as a moderate libertarian.
                    Its not a positive way. Lets not forget that Bioshock is a critical fiction, so the writers wrote the Splicers reaction. As a libertarian, I disagree that the markets would react in such a violent way. I was merely drawing the line that the Splicers were a part of the market. People often forget that Adam Smith‚Äôs ‚Äúinvisible hand of the market‚Äù are just people who participate in a market. The splicers participated, albeit in a violent way. I however, disagree that the markets would retaliate to such an extreme. It is likely rather that people would simply cease patronizing such a character as Andrew Ryan.
                        >Lets not forget that Bioshock is a critical fiction, so the writers wrote the Splicers reaction.

It's funny that you said that, because the critic Ken Levine had with Atlas Shrugged is that she can write whatever she wants. Characters behave perfectly in Gault's Gulch. 

Ken Levine asked himself "What if the characters weren't paragons but were instead, fallible people, just like in real life ?". 

Granted, he was thinking about Andrew Ryan, Fontaine, Tenenbaum, Sochong, etc. Characters that weren't following the objectivist ideology because of their greed, hubris and hypocrisy.  

The splicers were just the sci fi version of that. That is, how would someone follow an ideology of rational decision making if they are incapable of thinking rationally ?
                            I never figured out in Atlas Shrugged how all that success in Galts Gulch was supposed to scale to an entire country.  People inclined to its social systems came there voluntarily, but outside are a whole lot of people who had the socialism ingrained in their lives and those beholden to it and very many would have to change from that to adopt the same objectivism.

Overcoming that inertia was to be the biggest problem.
"Andrew Ryan seized Fontaines business"

They seize assets of criminal enterprises today

Historically the possessions of traitors were seized also.

There also was this minor issue of Fontaine Futuristics making most of the ADAM in Rapture and because of the addiction the stoppage of that production would send the addicts into craziness and insanity you hope you never ever see. Its Ryans city and he doesnt want to see it destroyed that way.  Who would run that company with Fontaine gone?   He did not seem someone to cultivate competent lieutenants and had no family  anything futher is barely mention as the logic contradicts the events they laid out.

The story was really a writer set up, with ryan getting the blame all so suddenly when ADAM had been poisoning citizens for years and nobody, including a free press, ever seemed to notice or blame Fontaine for peddling poison.  No lawsuits, no denounciation no relatives firing shotguns into his face for their familymembers Fontaine poisoned.
And he also had a strangled-hold on who could and could not leave! He turned a guy into a Big Daddy just because the guy found his way to Rapture on his own!
    > he also had a strangled-hold on who could and could not leave


Nobody could leave.  You went to Rapture understanding that.
    Mark Metzler turned Big Daddy was a Sophia Lamb move, not Ryan.
        I was referring to Johnny Topside, a.k.a. Subject Delta. He made it to Rapture in a (possibly stolen I think) deep sea diving suit, Ryan didnt like it, Johnny Topside ‚ÄúVolunteered‚Äù for the protector program.
            Its never explained when that happened.

Gathering and protectors should not have existed or needed to exist before the terrorist attacks by atlas and his rebels started making huge piles of citizens corpses available. 

It was Fontaine who created the slug hosts using children which was kept secret from the population and Ryan.    Seems a hard thing to keep secret in such a small place and Ryan would be running to use such a thing against Fontaine, his rival, dont you think?  Same for the poisonous effect ADAM had on people, amazingly kept hidden or ignored when Ryan would want such city destroying factors exposed.
Actually Ryan wasn't a fascist. A authoritarian tyrant, a slaver, a mass murderer, a monster, a bald faced liar, hypocrite and a narcissist. But not a fascist. (Getting a good definition of fascism is actually very hard!) The one area Ryan fails the definition is that fascists are all about sacrificing the good of the individual for the good of the nation. Ryan was about everything for himself. I guess it's all fascists regimes authoritarian, but not all authoritarians are fascists. sm
    Ryan talks constantly about the ‚ÄúGreat Chain of Society‚Äù and how all must pull on it, or at least all who are useful. Ryan saw his own wealth and success as proof of society being improved.
        And ONLY his own wealth. When someone else threatened his position he turned tyrant really fast. Ryan only loved his libertarian ideas when he thought they benefited him personally. sm
        Actually the Great Chain is where some few, from their merit and effort, pull the chain forward for everyone (who are on it in that society).   And recognizing that the chain moves most when more people pull and move it ahead, THEN having the society organized to GET OUT OF THOSE PEOPLES WAY benefits everyone the most.

Parasites dont just NOT pull on The Chain, they impede others trying to pull it forward.
Unfortunately having absurdities as a backdrop creates doubt if you want the players to empathize.  Story was allegedly what is supposed to set this game apart and normalism, at least of a world 70 years ago, was to be the foil for the 'Shock'  of the ADAM element which the player is supposed to project into THEIR normal lives.
"Planting Arcadia"
Ryan : "On the surface, I once bought a forest.  The Parasites claimed that the land belonged to God, and demanded that I establish a public park there.  Why ? So the rabble could stand slack jawed under the canopy and pretend that it was paradise earned.  When Congress moved to nationalize my forest,  I burnt it to the ground.  God did not plant the seeds of this Arcadia;  I did."

Where did you get this  'fair market value' ?   The government usually doesn't do that .

'Large' ?  where did you get that ? 

You need to base your argument on something actually in the game.
    Because the US Constitution prohibits the government from just seizing private property. And I never said ‚Äúlarge.‚Äù
        Eminent Domain
The power to take private property for public use by a state, municipality, or private person or corporation authorized to exercise functions of public character, following the payment of just compensation to the owner of that property.

Unfortunately 'just' is whatever the government involved says it is and NOT what the owner thinks.   THUS 'seized' (frequently with a token payment to be 'legal'

ALSO As I said, criminals very frequently have their assets seized when they are the product of crimes committed and as compensation for the crimes.  Strange contradition : that Ryan goes chapter and verse with Langford but no such legal-eaglism is invoke in Ryan's defence for the Agreements all people who came to Rapture would have signed.  The writes selected whatever fit their narrative.
If people want to charge others for their services, they are free to do so.
    yes but its not 'government tax'


a debate might be how much of Rapture Ryan owns and thus gets rent from and is expected like any landlord to keep up the property from those collected moneys.

    I'm assuming that's a typo because 'sweat of his brown' sounds like diarrhoea
Correct, churches are non profits. The problem is, they're not held to the same standard that non religious non profit organizations.  They dont have to demonstrate that they are a benefit to the community, it's just assumed while other non-profits have to demonstrate their benefit to the community, and they dont have to open their books to the public. How much of the money that you donate to a church or religious non-profit will go to where they say it goes? You have no idea because they arent required to open their books to the public.
    many non-church 'charities' have a tiny fraction of the collected money go to the actual intended benefit and THEY do supposedly have their 'books open'.    If you GO to the church you generally SEE the benefits in action.
        Really? Can you point me towards where I can find information on the "many" non church charities not put money they have collected to the intended benefit..., then compair that to the number of religious organizations who have done the same... but you cant because churches dont have their books open to the public....and yea, if you go to a church you can see the benefits in action... but the problem is they are not supposed to be only benefiting themselfs... they need to demonstrate they are a benefit to the community, not just a benefit to those who show up every sunday and line the churches pickets with unregulated money...also, you say that non church charities "supposedly" have their books open...what do you mean by that. Because by law they have to. If they dont, then they dont deserve non profit status
            you are behind the times, the government started tracking church books decades ago into having to prove what the 'non-profit' money was being spent on.

Supposedly 'fund raising activities' which are basically a big party and high life for the people running the 'charity'

If you have a local PBS channel go investigate how much the people running the station are paying themselves.  You might be shocked.
                I reccomend just doing a basic google search... I came across a page from the IRS website (updated in 2019 so it's not old news and I'm not behind on the times...) that literally describes how churches and religious non profits are exempt from opening their books to the public, and are not required to file a form 990... another page on the irs website even lists Special Rules Limiting IRS Authority to Audit a Church...

    And he killed Liz god damn it!
    Yeah but think how good jack turned out. Or how scummy. Either way Fontaine was a dick
No, it belongs to everyone
   -man in moscow
    I rejected those answers.
        Instead I chose something different... I chose the impossible... I chose RAPTURE!
As apposed to what starving and not having a job?
I always thought technicwise it‚Äòs really futuristic
It certainly didn't help, but it only accelerated the inevitable.  Rapture on dry land would've gone the same way.
    I honest don‚Äôt think it would have gone down quite the same. Not imploded quite so spectacularly. The deep sea location enforced an intense isolationist policy and significantly increased the difficulty in smuggling and emigration. Not to mention the intense mental and physical rigors of *actually* living underwater. Plus we cannot ignore the influence of the under water slugs who produce the Adam which further mentally unhinges users.
        They would have turned isolationist even without the deep sea city, the entire point of the city was to prove that pure capitalism without following other countries laws (and there fore sooner or later getting blocked from trading in those countries) and ideals.

&#x200B;

Andrew Ryan where just Milton Friedman on super crack, not taking into account that you actually need to have some kind of government that is there to make sure that there actually is some kind of structure and blind justice.

What Ryan managed to create would have turned into something much, much worse if they never found Adam as Rapture most likely would had gotten a civil war like the one we see in Infinite, class warfare where something that where brewing before Adam as not everyone that lived in Rapture where rich
            Except in Columbia you had the cronyism of the Founders, particularly Fink and some moronically absurd banking thing -- 50% Tithing taken on bank deposits.   The writers threw together so many contradicting extremes that the setting was patently impossible.

Ryan's philosophy allowed for competition where the free market equalized advantage if the writers ever were consistent when such things got in the way of their twist-forced plot
                The problem with the writing is actually that it's System Shock but under water and with genetics instead of psyhonics with a lot of Neoliberalism thrown in for good mesure
                    I never played System Shock to make any comparison, though Ive heard alot of the elements are very similar.

Apparently the production of the original BioShock was changed significantly in its last year  after playtesting revealed major shortcomings.

The second BioShock game followed the first in concept and mechanisms, and I don't remember it being mentioned that they had any rush situations.  That ontop of also doing Multiplayer and then Minervas Den 

Infinite was significantly rewritten 2/3 times and huge chunks of effort were abandoned.   The game elements were similar, some missing, others simplified -- so that shouldn't have taken that much time away.   With the story/setting moved far further into Fantasy, I found it odd they continued to make believe it was a reflection of the Real World as the interviews claimed.    I saw no 'shock' that was supposed to change things, as the play was a Flying Reactionary Cult Compound from the start, and could have just as well been on the ground.   The Tears could have been 'the shock',  but weren't much utilized.

.
                        The entire twist in Bioshock is the same as in System Shock, there are a lot of other things that are simular or identical, if I have to choose between SS and BS I will pick SS every day of the week as it's core concept is how corporate greed have twisted and made a hyper intelligent AI crazy only because the company that owns it wants to evade paying taxes
                        >Infinite was significantly rewritten 2/3 times and huge chunks of effort were abandoned.   The game elements were similar, some missing, others simplified -- so that shouldn't have taken that much time away.

Tell me more!
I meant like in aesthetic wise, it looks really good, so that's why people use it for examples of something looking good. Yes, it was a garbage can on fire, but the garbage can had a pretty coat of paint.
    Art deco looks cool. We have art deco.
        Yeah but we don't have *underwater* art deco
    A pretty coat of pain which would have collapsed due to the pressure lol still looked nice though, loved the vibe the outside gave off
        Yeah, me too.
    Isn‚Äôt that society in a nutshell though I mean either way you‚Äôre going to be told a lie you might as well have a pretty fucking city and it‚Äôs a joke honestly because either way the world would be shit but the meme is basically stating that Jeff Bezos is a materialistic person so he could make society look more aesthetic with all the money he has, however, it‚Äôll still be a society which ultimately ends in chaos.
Yeah but they died looking cool
    I would call them ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù at this point. Not really cool anymore.
With what architecture exactly would an underwater city that 'is possible' be built ??  

Art Deco represented a time long before now when the US had a society quite a bit closer to that objectivism in its operation.

You had neat Manhattan skylines of Fitzgeralds 20s golden city to wow you.
Still very close
    But still so far away, which is kinda the point
The writers made ryan and rapture that way to autofail.   Ready made dystopia for player gunfire and slaughter.

Consider Rapture ran from 1946 to 1958 pretty well.
An anarchistic city is an oxymoron.  
Modern large commerce under anarchy is an oxymoron.
    No, it‚Äôs not an oxymoron. Rapture just wasn‚Äôt anarchistic, you had Ryan‚Äôs committee or whatever it‚Äôs called that he ruled Rapture from
        thats my point - it couldnt be an anarchistically run place.

a city cannot exist as anarchy,  thus Rapture couldnt be anarchy

detractors have to paint libertarianism as anarchy as their faulty argument to sway those who dont understand what's being talked about.

the writers might try to imply it, but it falls down on examination
But if I can have the power to shoot fire or send attack bees, I'm gonna get on that.  Not to murder yall, just BC shooting fire is cool and the other is my favorite plasmid.
except the 'civil war' was a product of the ADAM    

remember all the poor people who couldnt compete if they didnt buy ADAM ?    Instability and uncertainty with this new destabilizing factor.

Remove it and the old ways you handled poverty would have worked.  Labor supply and demand separated from the End Of Construction depression the city seems to have largely survived already.   People change jobs all the time so that was ludicrously simplistic in the first place when the people there in Rapture were supposed to be go-getters already AND from the society of 70 years ago.
    Most of the citizens of Rapture were under constant mental strain from the utter lack of voice in their governing (Ryan‚Äôs word was pretty much was god‚Äôs word) and economics (Ryan Industries dominated the economy of the city). It was an incredibly isolated city with a total lack of reprieve, thanks to having absolutely no upward mobility. It‚Äôs the reason Ryan invited Sophia Lamb to Rapture, afterall. Lamb who made things worse. Lamb who was imprisoned in Persephone and continued to rule from there. 

There was gasoline all over Rapture already, before Adam was introduced. Adam was the match.
        You assume first by what detractors said in audio diaries when we hardly heard anyone like the majority supporting Ryan.


What governing exactly did the people NOT have a voice in ??  The idea is they do their thing without much government.    Ryan's "I make one law" about smuggling - so he DIDNT make a whole lot of laws otherwise...
The society had rules you signed on to to even go to Rapture.  There were all THOSE laws already which people were expected to live by.


Who says Ryan Industries dominated the city ??  I saw lots of competition in all kinds of things.  You have to support your statement.
I figure he tapped many other millionaires to first even build Rapture and Thus THEY owned huge chunks of it also.  Everyone who went there would want to bring their surface wealth to position themselves.  So FAR more people than Ryan owned and 'ran' their own things.   Rights to your own property is part of libertarianism/objectivism. 


No, Sofia lamb was there to treat the cabin fever of people who werent used to being closed in by the environment - not the governance.  


No. ADAM was the thing that made the firefighting equipment not work.  The writers made sure that all the counter-balances checks and balances within Raptures objectivist and libertarian  society WERE NOT THERE to be allowed to work to set up their auto-fail dystopia .
Do you think Rapture was presented as an exceptionally good idea that had no flaws?
    This was intended as sarcasm but I figure include /s. Probably should've
It does. The idea is that it looks cool on the surface. People are just overthinking this way too much lol.
    That‚Äôs fair. It‚Äôs just hard not to overthink it when it‚Äôs kinda the whole point of the first two games
    It's kind of like saying "oh this is a cool fucking cartoon, love the artwork" and then thinking if only real life was like this.  Kinda pointless really...
actual statistic   X profit is BEFORE or After dividends are paid to the stockholders ... (who pay the tax on the 'profit')
    The question doesn't make sense. Dividends **are** the profit. The company pays taxes on the profit, then it distributes part of the profit as dividends.
        the point is they are NOT 'taxes paid by Amazon'

my question is the statistics you gave reflecting having a big chunk of the company profits NOT having 'taxes' paid by the company

It (those dividends) is something someone who wants to exaggerate the 'taxes that Amazon doesnt pay' (as in not paying their 'fair share')  does not include to specify when they compare numbers with the simple income of the company
does nickelback hate rock?

Aynd Rand is not even a anarchist lmao what are you people going on about

You guys are way off the goop, both by thinking that bioshock is a comprehensive and deep critique of objectivism while in reality it's message is really shallow (if the state doesn't regulate drugs, people will become a bunch of fiends!!!) and by completely mischaracterizing ayn rand's so roughly

Nobody on this thread has read even ayn rand's Wikipedia article and it shows
    Fucking thank you. Jesus people are so first  level. The anti objectivism view is literally on the fuckin surface.
    Bioshock is not even a critique of objectivism. It's a critique of human nature. People in Rapture weren't following the objectivist morality. Everyone was a bunch of hypocrites.

You are the radical here. I'm not an objectivist. I'm a moderate libertarian, or centrist who leans libertarian. You are an anarchic communist. Bioshock 2 has a critique for you too, buddy.
                I wish I could upvote this more. A dev with a skin deep understanding of Rand's ideas like in this sub would not have been able to represent it so well, with as much nuance.

I loved the game, bc i saw way, way more than "freedom=bad". The larger takeaway seemed to me to be "absolute power corrupts absolutely" but I like that point about Fontaine not having ideals. I'll have to play through again now with that in mind
                    I think the game also tries to make you ride the fence on the subject. Despite Ryan being a villain, he is not the main villain and you can understand his actions. He did what he did to protect the city. 

And Rapture does seem like an awesome place to live (before the war of course), it's no wonder the city sticks in our head. A fictional place that is real in our mind (like Middle Earth, for example). 

You can understand the characters's decisions. And the story is written in such a way that any decision they took would lead to ruin, one way or the other. It is a tragic story.
                        It's excellent and complicated. They did a phenomenal job. Especially with the first one.
    Nah man, it's cool because people taking this seriously are as dumb as the people getting riled up. Besides, it's not like anyone in here gives enough of a fuck about Rand to know about her lmao just smile and wave, boys
r/rareinsults

Not wrong though
    LOOK AT THIS ATLAS

EVERYTIME I DO IT MAKES ME SHRUG
Now, now, aren't we insulting Nickelback there?

Have read some of Rand's stuff (because it is considered as almost a holy book by neo-cons), it is a .... challenge. I cannot imagine any such society being sustainable.
Death of the author
    We can discuss our interpretations. But I think the previous comments before mine were discussing author's intent.
        The game serves perfectly as an example of why objectivism/utopian unregulated capitalism wouldn't work. Andrew (Ayn) Ryan (Rand) perfectly represents Ayn Rand herself including backstory, ideals and name and he is the cowardly villain in the game. The game also spewers you with capitalist and objectivist propaganda portrayed in a bad light. Ken Levine's single reply is literally the only thing pointing towards something else than a critique of objectivism
            See, you have the superficial analysis that most players have. When you analise the story in depth, you see that is much more complicated than that. 

Ryan was a hypocrite. He banned trade and communication with the outside world. He nationalised Fontaine's Futuristics. He continued the Little Sister program (created by Fontaine) and he created the Big Daddy program. He even used pheromones to control the minds of splicers. 

He wasn't following his ideology, neither was any of the main characters. So the city couldn't have fallen due to objectivism or unregulated capitalism. Those weren't being followed. 

What lead to the city's downfall was the power struggle between Ryan and Fontaine/Atlas. Fontaine got rich through smuggling. Which was only possible due to Ryan banning trade with the surface. Atlas only "showed up" because Ryan needed Fontaine dead. Fontaine/Atlas was only capable of creating his army by using Fontaine's charities. 

None of this is the result of objectivist philosophy. The only thing that is, is the unregulated Adam. And even that is a fictional thing.

The game's genius storytelling serves to show us things are more complicated than they first seem. From the beginning of the game we are lead to believe that Ryan is the villain. Later we realize that he is not the main villain. Fontaine is. And Fontaine doesn't even believe in anything. Ryan is still a villain, but his actions are still understandable.
                Quite the interesting analysis, and you defiently bring a lot of good points to the table, but for me, it still serves as a monument towards the imminent failure of all utopian ideologies, be it objectivism (bioshock 1), communism (bioshock 2) and whatever Colombia is (theocracy? Monarcy? Extreme Patriotism?)
                    >it still serves as a monument towards the imminent failure of all utopian ideologies

But it really is. That's what Ken Levine was trying to say.
                        Yes, and bioshock 1 is for the imminent failure of Ayn Rand's nonsensical ideologies, also known as objectivism.
                >  He banned trade and communication with the outside world.

what dont you get about 'secret city' ?

Google cold war  and atomic war if you want to understand the reasons for it all.
                    I know. That's why I said his actions were understandable.
lack of actual execution of the social contract by the writers upon the story 

game needed a dystopia, and rather heavy handly the writers forced one.
But:

1. It wasn't just Adam that threw Rapture into chaos. It was first and foremost, the power struggle between Ryan and Atlas.
2. Adam is a fictional substance. Using Adam to argue in favor of regulations is a straw man fallacy.
    Remember before Atlas it was Fontaine doing things to undermine Ryan and Raptures philosophy.

Against ADAM all you needed was a free press , which is supposed to exist there and the right to know and be informed about the side effects of ADAM.  Competing newspapers would outdo each other covering the first few horror stories about its sideeffects.   Most people would hear about the insanity and would say NO WONT TOUCH IT.  Simple peer and consumer pressure even without government action would have a strong effect.   Thus ADAM minimized, no Fontaine fortune, no collapse of order and no game to shoot things up in.    

Notice that the writers needed the atlas terrorism war to force so many people to suddenly use ADAM  when it seems as the story goes to have minimal effect before that.    OR what I just outlined above would have happened and eliminated ADAM as a major thing nullifying the whole plot.
        Yeah. I think a major flaw is that people wouldn't normally use Adam if they knew the side effects. People who choose to not use drugs, don't do it because they are illegal. They do it because of the side effects. But I think it kind of makes sense in the context of the civil war. It's an arms race and you need to survive.
            Or you join the Rapture Militia get issued guns and not Plasmids, get organized and slaughter the Splicers.

If all else fails the Splicer bastions get closed off and their heat and air turned off til they are all dead.
                But there were also civilians caught in the cross fire. People who needed to protect their business and their families. What are you gonna do when the whole city is in chaos and looting ?
                    in a terror warzone those things largely cease or move to subsistence and bunkerism.   They are NOT normal times.

Civilians? Who arent supporting Ryan and ORDER ?  Most would say "RYAN PLEASE kill all these terrorists!!!" and then join the militia, if anything just to protect themselves.  Ryan then secures the city section by section and wipes the anarchist/terrorist/rebels out.   By the time of Bioshock thats basically what had happened. Pheromone Control neutralized Atlas's army and he was hiding in his spiderhole.

BTW What exactly did Atlas offer that normal people would want?  Anarchy is not a basis for survival for the people in Rapture, and many of them went there to GET AWAY FROM the likes of Atlas.
                        Yeah, you know. I was under the impression that the parts of the city we play in during the game are the parts that were cut off by Ryan. And the rest of the city is still functioning properly with people working and living their lives. 

But I'm not so sure of that. When Ryan decides to make the player kill him, it appears as if everything was already lost.
>I also don't quite understand why Ryan wants to halt the smuggling  operations, either. I understand he is isolationist, but doesn't halting  business like that violate his principles? 

Yes. It violates. But he thinks if the outside world knows about Rapture, the US or the USSR will try to destroy it. It's an example of why Ryan betrays his principles all the time. He is always doing it to protect the city. It's genius story telling.

The critique wasn't on objectivism. It was on human nature and utopias in general.
    People keep calling it a 'utopia'.  Somewhere Ryan himself says that there will have to be adjustments made by the population to adapt away from that parasitic world they came from.  That doesn't sound like a utopia.   Rapture's and Ryan's philosophy was hardly absolutist.

Ryan and his principles, but doesnt he hold back again and again from interfering in the story: ADAM side effects,  Fontaine's business practices, not eliminating smuggling ... Then finally since nobody else seem inclined to do anything Ryan is the one who acts to save the city and gets blamed for "violating his philosophy" and is labeled a hypocrite.
To be fair, however, in a free market no one would have the same power that Andrew Ryan held. Or at the least, if he did something such as asset seizure, likely the markets would decide that he is no longer worthy of their dollar, and stop supporting him. Because Andrew Ryan became an authoritarian of his pseudo-state, the markets ceased to trust him.

Andrew Ryan dealt in bad faith, and so the markets retaliated. Albeit, with violence and force rather than peaceful action.
    Almost as if "free market" is a moving goal post used to keep the wealthy in their position.
        I‚Äôm not exactly sure what you mean by that, if you‚Äôd elaborate? If your saying that the wealthy define what a free market is in order to stay in power, I don‚Äôt think that holds up. A free market is a defined system regardless of what the wealthy say. However the wealthy will certainly do what they can to stay wealthy. In Andrew Ryan‚Äôs case, he got greedy. The competition scared him, so he used his power to put out the competition. This is acting in bad faith in a market; he went back on his contract with Fontaine (allowing Fontaine to do business in rapture) to which Fontaine retaliated.
            Rhetorically people have used "free market" to justify not having taxes or regulation on their income/wealth/power. Ryan in Bioshock wanted to force people to not provide any charity. 

And the market in Bioshock certainly was not free as Ryan had a hand in everything and tried to crush competition along with banning media from the surface world. 

Without any rules, Rapture ended up a state with monopolies only, certainly not free. And with rules, many market actors would consider the market unfree as well.
                I understand now. Anyway, my point is Bioshock was a lot more nuanced than just ‚Äúlibertarian bad.‚Äù It had a lot of interesting factors that led to the downfall of rapture, not just the free markets. Was it a criticism of Ayn Rand? 100%. But it was done in good faith and is an incredible game series.
                    I 100% agree with your statement. The inequality combined with a new technology released unfettered into the society was what I see the main reason why Rapture fell.
                But Ryan didn't force people to not provide any charity. Fontaine had his charities. Ryan just didn't trust that because he thought it made people feel entitled and it could be used to manipulate people, which it did.
    >Andrew Ryan dealt in bad faith, and so the markets retaliated. Albeit, with violence and force rather than peaceful action. 

But that didn't happen though. The market didn't stop supporting him, everyone was still buying stuff from Ryan Industries. What happened was Atlas gathered a crowd of dissatisfied, brainwashed, adam junkie people to try to take over the city.
        Ah yes you‚Äôre right. However, adam junkies still comprise part of the market.
            And they were also killing random people for their Adam. I still don't see how that's the market self regulating in a positive way. And I say this as a moderate libertarian.
                Its not a positive way. Lets not forget that Bioshock is a critical fiction, so the writers wrote the Splicers reaction. As a libertarian, I disagree that the markets would react in such a violent way. I was merely drawing the line that the Splicers were a part of the market. People often forget that Adam Smith‚Äôs ‚Äúinvisible hand of the market‚Äù are just people who participate in a market. The splicers participated, albeit in a violent way. I however, disagree that the markets would retaliate to such an extreme. It is likely rather that people would simply cease patronizing such a character as Andrew Ryan.
                    >Lets not forget that Bioshock is a critical fiction, so the writers wrote the Splicers reaction.

It's funny that you said that, because the critic Ken Levine had with Atlas Shrugged is that she can write whatever she wants. Characters behave perfectly in Gault's Gulch. 

Ken Levine asked himself "What if the characters weren't paragons but were instead, fallible people, just like in real life ?". 

Granted, he was thinking about Andrew Ryan, Fontaine, Tenenbaum, Sochong, etc. Characters that weren't following the objectivist ideology because of their greed, hubris and hypocrisy.  

The splicers were just the sci fi version of that. That is, how would someone follow an ideology of rational decision making if they are incapable of thinking rationally ?
                        I never figured out in Atlas Shrugged how all that success in Galts Gulch was supposed to scale to an entire country.  People inclined to its social systems came there voluntarily, but outside are a whole lot of people who had the socialism ingrained in their lives and those beholden to it and very many would have to change from that to adopt the same objectivism.

Overcoming that inertia was to be the biggest problem.
> he also had a strangled-hold on who could and could not leave


Nobody could leave.  You went to Rapture understanding that.
Mark Metzler turned Big Daddy was a Sophia Lamb move, not Ryan.
    I was referring to Johnny Topside, a.k.a. Subject Delta. He made it to Rapture in a (possibly stolen I think) deep sea diving suit, Ryan didnt like it, Johnny Topside ‚ÄúVolunteered‚Äù for the protector program.
        Its never explained when that happened.

Gathering and protectors should not have existed or needed to exist before the terrorist attacks by atlas and his rebels started making huge piles of citizens corpses available. 

It was Fontaine who created the slug hosts using children which was kept secret from the population and Ryan.    Seems a hard thing to keep secret in such a small place and Ryan would be running to use such a thing against Fontaine, his rival, dont you think?  Same for the poisonous effect ADAM had on people, amazingly kept hidden or ignored when Ryan would want such city destroying factors exposed.
Ryan talks constantly about the ‚ÄúGreat Chain of Society‚Äù and how all must pull on it, or at least all who are useful. Ryan saw his own wealth and success as proof of society being improved.
    And ONLY his own wealth. When someone else threatened his position he turned tyrant really fast. Ryan only loved his libertarian ideas when he thought they benefited him personally. sm
    Actually the Great Chain is where some few, from their merit and effort, pull the chain forward for everyone (who are on it in that society).   And recognizing that the chain moves most when more people pull and move it ahead, THEN having the society organized to GET OUT OF THOSE PEOPLES WAY benefits everyone the most.

Parasites dont just NOT pull on The Chain, they impede others trying to pull it forward.
Because the US Constitution prohibits the government from just seizing private property. And I never said ‚Äúlarge.‚Äù
    Eminent Domain
The power to take private property for public use by a state, municipality, or private person or corporation authorized to exercise functions of public character, following the payment of just compensation to the owner of that property.

Unfortunately 'just' is whatever the government involved says it is and NOT what the owner thinks.   THUS 'seized' (frequently with a token payment to be 'legal'

ALSO As I said, criminals very frequently have their assets seized when they are the product of crimes committed and as compensation for the crimes.  Strange contradition : that Ryan goes chapter and verse with Langford but no such legal-eaglism is invoke in Ryan's defence for the Agreements all people who came to Rapture would have signed.  The writes selected whatever fit their narrative.
yes but its not 'government tax'


a debate might be how much of Rapture Ryan owns and thus gets rent from and is expected like any landlord to keep up the property from those collected moneys.

turnstyles on the metro  near the end of Welcome Center

paytoilets
I'm assuming that's a typo because 'sweat of his brown' sounds like diarrhoea
many non-church 'charities' have a tiny fraction of the collected money go to the actual intended benefit and THEY do supposedly have their 'books open'.    If you GO to the church you generally SEE the benefits in action.
    Really? Can you point me towards where I can find information on the "many" non church charities not put money they have collected to the intended benefit..., then compair that to the number of religious organizations who have done the same... but you cant because churches dont have their books open to the public....and yea, if you go to a church you can see the benefits in action... but the problem is they are not supposed to be only benefiting themselfs... they need to demonstrate they are a benefit to the community, not just a benefit to those who show up every sunday and line the churches pickets with unregulated money...also, you say that non church charities "supposedly" have their books open...what do you mean by that. Because by law they have to. If they dont, then they dont deserve non profit status
        you are behind the times, the government started tracking church books decades ago into having to prove what the 'non-profit' money was being spent on.

Supposedly 'fund raising activities' which are basically a big party and high life for the people running the 'charity'

If you have a local PBS channel go investigate how much the people running the station are paying themselves.  You might be shocked.
            I reccomend just doing a basic google search... I came across a page from the IRS website (updated in 2019 so it's not old news and I'm not behind on the times...) that literally describes how churches and religious non profits are exempt from opening their books to the public, and are not required to file a form 990... another page on the irs website even lists Special Rules Limiting IRS Authority to Audit a Church...
And he killed Liz god damn it!
Yeah but think how good jack turned out. Or how scummy. Either way Fontaine was a dick
I rejected those answers.
    Instead I chose something different... I chose the impossible... I chose RAPTURE!
I honest don‚Äôt think it would have gone down quite the same. Not imploded quite so spectacularly. The deep sea location enforced an intense isolationist policy and significantly increased the difficulty in smuggling and emigration. Not to mention the intense mental and physical rigors of *actually* living underwater. Plus we cannot ignore the influence of the under water slugs who produce the Adam which further mentally unhinges users.
    They would have turned isolationist even without the deep sea city, the entire point of the city was to prove that pure capitalism without following other countries laws (and there fore sooner or later getting blocked from trading in those countries) and ideals.

&#x200B;

Andrew Ryan where just Milton Friedman on super crack, not taking into account that you actually need to have some kind of government that is there to make sure that there actually is some kind of structure and blind justice.

What Ryan managed to create would have turned into something much, much worse if they never found Adam as Rapture most likely would had gotten a civil war like the one we see in Infinite, class warfare where something that where brewing before Adam as not everyone that lived in Rapture where rich
        Except in Columbia you had the cronyism of the Founders, particularly Fink and some moronically absurd banking thing -- 50% Tithing taken on bank deposits.   The writers threw together so many contradicting extremes that the setting was patently impossible.

Ryan's philosophy allowed for competition where the free market equalized advantage if the writers ever were consistent when such things got in the way of their twist-forced plot
            The problem with the writing is actually that it's System Shock but under water and with genetics instead of psyhonics with a lot of Neoliberalism thrown in for good mesure
                I never played System Shock to make any comparison, though Ive heard alot of the elements are very similar.

Apparently the production of the original BioShock was changed significantly in its last year  after playtesting revealed major shortcomings.

The second BioShock game followed the first in concept and mechanisms, and I don't remember it being mentioned that they had any rush situations.  That ontop of also doing Multiplayer and then Minervas Den 

Infinite was significantly rewritten 2/3 times and huge chunks of effort were abandoned.   The game elements were similar, some missing, others simplified -- so that shouldn't have taken that much time away.   With the story/setting moved far further into Fantasy, I found it odd they continued to make believe it was a reflection of the Real World as the interviews claimed.    I saw no 'shock' that was supposed to change things, as the play was a Flying Reactionary Cult Compound from the start, and could have just as well been on the ground.   The Tears could have been 'the shock',  but weren't much utilized.

.
                    The entire twist in Bioshock is the same as in System Shock, there are a lot of other things that are simular or identical, if I have to choose between SS and BS I will pick SS every day of the week as it's core concept is how corporate greed have twisted and made a hyper intelligent AI crazy only because the company that owns it wants to evade paying taxes
                    >Infinite was significantly rewritten 2/3 times and huge chunks of effort were abandoned.   The game elements were similar, some missing, others simplified -- so that shouldn't have taken that much time away.

Tell me more!
Art deco looks cool. We have art deco.
    Yeah but we don't have *underwater* art deco
A pretty coat of pain which would have collapsed due to the pressure lol still looked nice though, loved the vibe the outside gave off
    Yeah, me too.
Isn‚Äôt that society in a nutshell though I mean either way you‚Äôre going to be told a lie you might as well have a pretty fucking city and it‚Äôs a joke honestly because either way the world would be shit but the meme is basically stating that Jeff Bezos is a materialistic person so he could make society look more aesthetic with all the money he has, however, it‚Äôll still be a society which ultimately ends in chaos.
I would call them ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù at this point. Not really cool anymore.
But still so far away, which is kinda the point
No, it‚Äôs not an oxymoron. Rapture just wasn‚Äôt anarchistic, you had Ryan‚Äôs committee or whatever it‚Äôs called that he ruled Rapture from
    thats my point - it couldnt be an anarchistically run place.

a city cannot exist as anarchy,  thus Rapture couldnt be anarchy

detractors have to paint libertarianism as anarchy as their faulty argument to sway those who dont understand what's being talked about.

the writers might try to imply it, but it falls down on examination
Most of the citizens of Rapture were under constant mental strain from the utter lack of voice in their governing (Ryan‚Äôs word was pretty much was god‚Äôs word) and economics (Ryan Industries dominated the economy of the city). It was an incredibly isolated city with a total lack of reprieve, thanks to having absolutely no upward mobility. It‚Äôs the reason Ryan invited Sophia Lamb to Rapture, afterall. Lamb who made things worse. Lamb who was imprisoned in Persephone and continued to rule from there. 

There was gasoline all over Rapture already, before Adam was introduced. Adam was the match.
    You assume first by what detractors said in audio diaries when we hardly heard anyone like the majority supporting Ryan.


What governing exactly did the people NOT have a voice in ??  The idea is they do their thing without much government.    Ryan's "I make one law" about smuggling - so he DIDNT make a whole lot of laws otherwise...
The society had rules you signed on to to even go to Rapture.  There were all THOSE laws already which people were expected to live by.


Who says Ryan Industries dominated the city ??  I saw lots of competition in all kinds of things.  You have to support your statement.
I figure he tapped many other millionaires to first even build Rapture and Thus THEY owned huge chunks of it also.  Everyone who went there would want to bring their surface wealth to position themselves.  So FAR more people than Ryan owned and 'ran' their own things.   Rights to your own property is part of libertarianism/objectivism. 


No, Sofia lamb was there to treat the cabin fever of people who werent used to being closed in by the environment - not the governance.  


No. ADAM was the thing that made the firefighting equipment not work.  The writers made sure that all the counter-balances checks and balances within Raptures objectivist and libertarian  society WERE NOT THERE to be allowed to work to set up their auto-fail dystopia .
This was intended as sarcasm but I figure include /s. Probably should've
That‚Äôs fair. It‚Äôs just hard not to overthink it when it‚Äôs kinda the whole point of the first two games
It's kind of like saying "oh this is a cool fucking cartoon, love the artwork" and then thinking if only real life was like this.  Kinda pointless really...
The question doesn't make sense. Dividends **are** the profit. The company pays taxes on the profit, then it distributes part of the profit as dividends.
    the point is they are NOT 'taxes paid by Amazon'

my question is the statistics you gave reflecting having a big chunk of the company profits NOT having 'taxes' paid by the company

It (those dividends) is something someone who wants to exaggerate the 'taxes that Amazon doesnt pay' (as in not paying their 'fair share')  does not include to specify when they compare numbers with the simple income of the company
Have you heard any of their songs? Cause i'm pretty sure they do
And anarchism
I'm not a lib. I was trying to see how far i could go in this sub before anyone commented on my mistake.

It's been 11 hours, currently sitting at 26 upvotes, and only 3 PEOPLE corrected me. That proves my point lol
    So in other words, you are a troll.
Fucking thank you. Jesus people are so first  level. The anti objectivism view is literally on the fuckin surface.
Bioshock is not even a critique of objectivism. It's a critique of human nature. People in Rapture weren't following the objectivist morality. Everyone was a bunch of hypocrites.

        Hey, Jackass. Why don't you listen to the [creator of the game himself](https://www.shacknews.com/article/48728/ken-levine-on-bioshock-the) ?

> *Ken Levine:  I'm fascinated by  Objectivism.  I think I gave it--I think the problem with any philosophy  is that it's up to people to carry it out.

>*Shack:  The plot really has a  major dynamic shift from Ryan to Fontaine in the last third of the game.   Is that part of a suggestion that it's not the philosophy that's  fundamentally at fault as much as a failure of all its participants to  play along?*

I play with this a lot in all  the games I do, whether it's back to Thief where you have the pagans  and the fundamentalists, and you feel sort of in the middle.  I think  Fontaine's an empty human.  That's what happens when you have nothing.*  

You are the radical here. I'm not an objectivist. I'm a moderate libertarian, or centrist who leans libertarian. You are an anarchic communist. Bioshock 2 has a critique for you too, buddy.
            I wish I could upvote this more. A dev with a skin deep understanding of Rand's ideas like in this sub would not have been able to represent it so well, with as much nuance. Plus what, it was the 00s, the subject matter wasn't remotely as offensive as it is now. I've read her shit several times but still ride the fence on a lot of it, but it is conceptually fascinating. I loved the game, bc i saw way, way more than "freedom=bad". The larger takeaway seemed to me to be "absolute power corrupts absolutely" but I like that point about Fontaine not having ideals. I'll have to play through again now with that in mind
                I think the game also tries to make you ride the fence on the subject. Despite Ryan being a villain, he is not the main villain and you can understand his actions. He did what he did to protect the city. 

And Rapture does seem like an awesome place to live (before the war of course), it's no wonder the city sticks in our head. A fictional place that is real in our mind (like Middle Earth, for example). 

You can understand the characters's decisions. And the story is written in such a way that any decision they took would lead to ruin, one way or the other. It is a tragic story.
                    It's excellent and complicated. They did a phenomenal job. Especially with the first one.
Nah man, it's cool because people taking this seriously are as dumb as the people getting riled up. Besides, it's not like anyone in here gives enough of a fuck about Rand to know about her lmao just smile and wave, boys
LOOK AT THIS ATLAS

EVERYTIME I DO IT MAKES ME SHRUG
We can discuss our interpretations. But I think the previous comments before mine were discussing author's intent.
    The game serves perfectly as an example of why objectivism/utopian unregulated capitalism wouldn't work. Andrew (Ayn) Ryan (Rand) perfectly represents Ayn Rand herself including backstory, ideals and name and he is the cowardly villain in the game. The game also spewers you with capitalist and objectivist propaganda portrayed in a bad light. Ken Levine's single reply is literally the only thing pointing towards something else than a critique of objectivism
        See, you have the superficial analysis that most players have. When you analise the story in depth, you see that is much more complicated than that. 

Ryan was a hypocrite. He banned trade and communication with the outside world. He nationalised Fontaine's Futuristics. He continued the Little Sister program (created by Fontaine) and he created the Big Daddy program. He even used pheromones to control the minds of splicers. 

He wasn't following his ideology, neither was any of the main characters. So the city couldn't have fallen due to objectivism or unregulated capitalism. Those weren't being followed. 

What lead to the city's downfall was the power struggle between Ryan and Fontaine/Atlas. Fontaine got rich through smuggling. Which was only possible due to Ryan banning trade with the surface. Atlas only "showed up" because Ryan needed Fontaine dead. Fontaine/Atlas was only capable of creating his army by using Fontaine's charities. 

None of this is the result of objectivist philosophy. The only thing that is, is the unregulated Adam. And even that is a fictional thing.

The game's genius storytelling serves to show us things are more complicated than they first seem. From the beginning of the game we are lead to believe that Ryan is the villain. Later we realize that he is not the main villain. Fontaine is. And Fontaine doesn't even believe in anything. Ryan is still a villain, but his actions are still understandable.
            Quite the interesting analysis, and you defiently bring a lot of good points to the table, but for me, it still serves as a monument towards the imminent failure of all utopian ideologies, be it objectivism (bioshock 1), communism (bioshock 2) and whatever Colombia is (theocracy? Monarcy? Extreme Patriotism?)
                >it still serves as a monument towards the imminent failure of all utopian ideologies

But it really is. That's what Ken Levine was trying to say.
                    Yes, and bioshock 1 is for the imminent failure of Ayn Rand's nonsensical ideologies, also known as objectivism.
            >  He banned trade and communication with the outside world.

what dont you get about 'secret city' ?

Google cold war  and atomic war if you want to understand the reasons for it all.
                I know. That's why I said his actions were understandable.
Remember before Atlas it was Fontaine doing things to undermine Ryan and Raptures philosophy.

Against ADAM all you needed was a free press , which is supposed to exist there and the right to know and be informed about the side effects of ADAM.  Competing newspapers would outdo each other covering the first few horror stories about its sideeffects.   Most people would hear about the insanity and would say NO WONT TOUCH IT.  Simple peer and consumer pressure even without government action would have a strong effect.   Thus ADAM minimized, no Fontaine fortune, no collapse of order and no game to shoot things up in.    

Notice that the writers needed the atlas terrorism war to force so many people to suddenly use ADAM  when it seems as the story goes to have minimal effect before that.    OR what I just outlined above would have happened and eliminated ADAM as a major thing nullifying the whole plot.
    Yeah. I think a major flaw is that people wouldn't normally use Adam if they knew the side effects. People who choose to not use drugs, don't do it because they are illegal. They do it because of the side effects. But I think it kind of makes sense in the context of the civil war. It's an arms race and you need to survive.
        Or you join the Rapture Militia get issued guns and not Plasmids, get organized and slaughter the Splicers.

If all else fails the Splicer bastions get closed off and their heat and air turned off til they are all dead.
            But there were also civilians caught in the cross fire. People who needed to protect their business and their families. What are you gonna do when the whole city is in chaos and looting ?
                in a terror warzone those things largely cease or move to subsistence and bunkerism.   They are NOT normal times.

Civilians? Who arent supporting Ryan and ORDER ?  Most would say "RYAN PLEASE kill all these terrorists!!!" and then join the militia, if anything just to protect themselves.  Ryan then secures the city section by section and wipes the anarchist/terrorist/rebels out.   By the time of Bioshock thats basically what had happened. Pheromone Control neutralized Atlas's army and he was hiding in his spiderhole.

BTW What exactly did Atlas offer that normal people would want?  Anarchy is not a basis for survival for the people in Rapture, and many of them went there to GET AWAY FROM the likes of Atlas.
                    Yeah, you know. I was under the impression that the parts of the city we play in during the game are the parts that were cut off by Ryan. And the rest of the city is still functioning properly with people working and living their lives. 

But I'm not so sure of that. When Ryan decides to make the player kill him, it appears as if everything was already lost.
People keep calling it a 'utopia'.  Somewhere Ryan himself says that there will have to be adjustments made by the population to adapt away from that parasitic world they came from.  That doesn't sound like a utopia.   Rapture's and Ryan's philosophy was hardly absolutist.

Ryan and his principles, but doesnt he hold back again and again from interfering in the story: ADAM side effects,  Fontaine's business practices, not eliminating smuggling ... Then finally since nobody else seem inclined to do anything Ryan is the one who acts to save the city and gets blamed for "violating his philosophy" and is labeled a hypocrite.
Almost as if "free market" is a moving goal post used to keep the wealthy in their position.
    I‚Äôm not exactly sure what you mean by that, if you‚Äôd elaborate? If your saying that the wealthy define what a free market is in order to stay in power, I don‚Äôt think that holds up. A free market is a defined system regardless of what the wealthy say. However the wealthy will certainly do what they can to stay wealthy. In Andrew Ryan‚Äôs case, he got greedy. The competition scared him, so he used his power to put out the competition. This is acting in bad faith in a market; he went back on his contract with Fontaine (allowing Fontaine to do business in rapture) to which Fontaine retaliated.
        Rhetorically people have used "free market" to justify not having taxes or regulation on their income/wealth/power. Ryan in Bioshock wanted to force people to not provide any charity. 

And the market in Bioshock certainly was not free as Ryan had a hand in everything and tried to crush competition along with banning media from the surface world. 

Without any rules, Rapture ended up a state with monopolies only, certainly not free. And with rules, many market actors would consider the market unfree as well.
            I understand now. Anyway, my point is Bioshock was a lot more nuanced than just ‚Äúlibertarian bad.‚Äù It had a lot of interesting factors that led to the downfall of rapture, not just the free markets. Was it a criticism of Ayn Rand? 100%. But it was done in good faith and is an incredible game series.
                I 100% agree with your statement. The inequality combined with a new technology released unfettered into the society was what I see the main reason why Rapture fell.
            But Ryan didn't force people to not provide any charity. Fontaine had his charities. Ryan just didn't trust that because he thought it made people feel entitled and it could be used to manipulate people, which it did.
>Andrew Ryan dealt in bad faith, and so the markets retaliated. Albeit, with violence and force rather than peaceful action. 

But that didn't happen though. The market didn't stop supporting him, everyone was still buying stuff from Ryan Industries. What happened was Atlas gathered a crowd of dissatisfied, brainwashed, adam junkie people to try to take over the city.
    Ah yes you‚Äôre right. However, adam junkies still comprise part of the market.
        And they were also killing random people for their Adam. I still don't see how that's the market self regulating in a positive way. And I say this as a moderate libertarian.
            Its not a positive way. Lets not forget that Bioshock is a critical fiction, so the writers wrote the Splicers reaction. As a libertarian, I disagree that the markets would react in such a violent way. I was merely drawing the line that the Splicers were a part of the market. People often forget that Adam Smith‚Äôs ‚Äúinvisible hand of the market‚Äù are just people who participate in a market. The splicers participated, albeit in a violent way. I however, disagree that the markets would retaliate to such an extreme. It is likely rather that people would simply cease patronizing such a character as Andrew Ryan.
                >Lets not forget that Bioshock is a critical fiction, so the writers wrote the Splicers reaction.

It's funny that you said that, because the critic Ken Levine had with Atlas Shrugged is that she can write whatever she wants. Characters behave perfectly in Gault's Gulch. 

Ken Levine asked himself "What if the characters weren't paragons but were instead, fallible people, just like in real life ?". 

Granted, he was thinking about Andrew Ryan, Fontaine, Tenenbaum, Sochong, etc. Characters that weren't following the objectivist ideology because of their greed, hubris and hypocrisy.  

The splicers were just the sci fi version of that. That is, how would someone follow an ideology of rational decision making if they are incapable of thinking rationally ?
                    I never figured out in Atlas Shrugged how all that success in Galts Gulch was supposed to scale to an entire country.  People inclined to its social systems came there voluntarily, but outside are a whole lot of people who had the socialism ingrained in their lives and those beholden to it and very many would have to change from that to adopt the same objectivism.

Overcoming that inertia was to be the biggest problem.
I was referring to Johnny Topside, a.k.a. Subject Delta. He made it to Rapture in a (possibly stolen I think) deep sea diving suit, Ryan didnt like it, Johnny Topside ‚ÄúVolunteered‚Äù for the protector program.
    Its never explained when that happened.

Gathering and protectors should not have existed or needed to exist before the terrorist attacks by atlas and his rebels started making huge piles of citizens corpses available. 

It was Fontaine who created the slug hosts using children which was kept secret from the population and Ryan.    Seems a hard thing to keep secret in such a small place and Ryan would be running to use such a thing against Fontaine, his rival, dont you think?  Same for the poisonous effect ADAM had on people, amazingly kept hidden or ignored when Ryan would want such city destroying factors exposed.
And ONLY his own wealth. When someone else threatened his position he turned tyrant really fast. Ryan only loved his libertarian ideas when he thought they benefited him personally. sm
Actually the Great Chain is where some few, from their merit and effort, pull the chain forward for everyone (who are on it in that society).   And recognizing that the chain moves most when more people pull and move it ahead, THEN having the society organized to GET OUT OF THOSE PEOPLES WAY benefits everyone the most.

Parasites dont just NOT pull on The Chain, they impede others trying to pull it forward.
Eminent Domain
The power to take private property for public use by a state, municipality, or private person or corporation authorized to exercise functions of public character, following the payment of just compensation to the owner of that property.

Unfortunately 'just' is whatever the government involved says it is and NOT what the owner thinks.   THUS 'seized' (frequently with a token payment to be 'legal'

ALSO As I said, criminals very frequently have their assets seized when they are the product of crimes committed and as compensation for the crimes.  Strange contradition : that Ryan goes chapter and verse with Langford but no such legal-eaglism is invoke in Ryan's defence for the Agreements all people who came to Rapture would have signed.  The writes selected whatever fit their narrative.
Really? Can you point me towards where I can find information on the "many" non church charities not put money they have collected to the intended benefit..., then compair that to the number of religious organizations who have done the same... but you cant because churches dont have their books open to the public....and yea, if you go to a church you can see the benefits in action... but the problem is they are not supposed to be only benefiting themselfs... they need to demonstrate they are a benefit to the community, not just a benefit to those who show up every sunday and line the churches pickets with unregulated money...also, you say that non church charities "supposedly" have their books open...what do you mean by that. Because by law they have to. If they dont, then they dont deserve non profit status
    you are behind the times, the government started tracking church books decades ago into having to prove what the 'non-profit' money was being spent on.

Supposedly 'fund raising activities' which are basically a big party and high life for the people running the 'charity'

If you have a local PBS channel go investigate how much the people running the station are paying themselves.  You might be shocked.
        I reccomend just doing a basic google search... I came across a page from the IRS website (updated in 2019 so it's not old news and I'm not behind on the times...) that literally describes how churches and religious non profits are exempt from opening their books to the public, and are not required to file a form 990... another page on the irs website even lists Special Rules Limiting IRS Authority to Audit a Church...
Instead I chose something different... I chose the impossible... I chose RAPTURE!
They would have turned isolationist even without the deep sea city, the entire point of the city was to prove that pure capitalism without following other countries laws (and there fore sooner or later getting blocked from trading in those countries) and ideals.

&#x200B;

Andrew Ryan where just Milton Friedman on super crack, not taking into account that you actually need to have some kind of government that is there to make sure that there actually is some kind of structure and blind justice.

What Ryan managed to create would have turned into something much, much worse if they never found Adam as Rapture most likely would had gotten a civil war like the one we see in Infinite, class warfare where something that where brewing before Adam as not everyone that lived in Rapture where rich
    Except in Columbia you had the cronyism of the Founders, particularly Fink and some moronically absurd banking thing -- 50% Tithing taken on bank deposits.   The writers threw together so many contradicting extremes that the setting was patently impossible.

Ryan's philosophy allowed for competition where the free market equalized advantage if the writers ever were consistent when such things got in the way of their twist-forced plot
        The problem with the writing is actually that it's System Shock but under water and with genetics instead of psyhonics with a lot of Neoliberalism thrown in for good mesure
            I never played System Shock to make any comparison, though Ive heard alot of the elements are very similar.

Apparently the production of the original BioShock was changed significantly in its last year  after playtesting revealed major shortcomings.

The second BioShock game followed the first in concept and mechanisms, and I don't remember it being mentioned that they had any rush situations.  That ontop of also doing Multiplayer and then Minervas Den 

Infinite was significantly rewritten 2/3 times and huge chunks of effort were abandoned.   The game elements were similar, some missing, others simplified -- so that shouldn't have taken that much time away.   With the story/setting moved far further into Fantasy, I found it odd they continued to make believe it was a reflection of the Real World as the interviews claimed.    I saw no 'shock' that was supposed to change things, as the play was a Flying Reactionary Cult Compound from the start, and could have just as well been on the ground.   The Tears could have been 'the shock',  but weren't much utilized.

.
                The entire twist in Bioshock is the same as in System Shock, there are a lot of other things that are simular or identical, if I have to choose between SS and BS I will pick SS every day of the week as it's core concept is how corporate greed have twisted and made a hyper intelligent AI crazy only because the company that owns it wants to evade paying taxes
                >Infinite was significantly rewritten 2/3 times and huge chunks of effort were abandoned.   The game elements were similar, some missing, others simplified -- so that shouldn't have taken that much time away.

Tell me more!
Yeah but we don't have *underwater* art deco
Yeah, me too.
thats my point - it couldnt be an anarchistically run place.

a city cannot exist as anarchy,  thus Rapture couldnt be anarchy

detractors have to paint libertarianism as anarchy as their faulty argument to sway those who dont understand what's being talked about.

the writers might try to imply it, but it falls down on examination
You assume first by what detractors said in audio diaries when we hardly heard anyone like the majority supporting Ryan.


What governing exactly did the people NOT have a voice in ??  The idea is they do their thing without much government.    Ryan's "I make one law" about smuggling - so he DIDNT make a whole lot of laws otherwise...
The society had rules you signed on to to even go to Rapture.  There were all THOSE laws already which people were expected to live by.


Who says Ryan Industries dominated the city ??  I saw lots of competition in all kinds of things.  You have to support your statement.
I figure he tapped many other millionaires to first even build Rapture and Thus THEY owned huge chunks of it also.  Everyone who went there would want to bring their surface wealth to position themselves.  So FAR more people than Ryan owned and 'ran' their own things.   Rights to your own property is part of libertarianism/objectivism. 


No, Sofia lamb was there to treat the cabin fever of people who werent used to being closed in by the environment - not the governance.  


No. ADAM was the thing that made the firefighting equipment not work.  The writers made sure that all the counter-balances checks and balances within Raptures objectivist and libertarian  society WERE NOT THERE to be allowed to work to set up their auto-fail dystopia .
the point is they are NOT 'taxes paid by Amazon'

my question is the statistics you gave reflecting having a big chunk of the company profits NOT having 'taxes' paid by the company

It (those dividends) is something someone who wants to exaggerate the 'taxes that Amazon doesnt pay' (as in not paying their 'fair share')  does not include to specify when they compare numbers with the simple income of the company
So in other words, you are a troll.

    Hey, Jackass. Why don't you listen to the [creator of the game himself](https://www.shacknews.com/article/48728/ken-levine-on-bioshock-the) ?

> *Ken Levine:  I'm fascinated by  Objectivism.  I think I gave it--I think the problem with any philosophy  is that it's up to people to carry it out.  It could have been  Objectivism, it could have been anything.  It's about what happens when  ideals meet reality.  If you had to sum up BioShock's story, that's what  it is.*    
>  
>*When philosophers write books, when they write fictional works  like Atlas Shrugged, they put paragons in the books to carry out their  ideals.  I always wanted to tell a story of, what if a guy wasn't a  paragon?  What if his intentions were really good, but at the end of the  day he was human?  I think that's where the problem is.*    
>  
>*It's not an attack on Objectivism, it's a fair look at humanity.   We screw things up. We're very, very fallible.  You have this  beautiful, beautiful city, and then what happens when reality meets the  ideals?  The visual look of the city is the ideals, and the water coming  in is reality.  It could have been Objectivism, it could have been  anything.*    
>  
>*Shack:  The plot really has a  major dynamic shift from Ryan to Fontaine in the last third of the game.   Is that part of a suggestion that it's not the philosophy that's  fundamentally at fault as much as a failure of all its participants to  play along?*    
>  
>*Ken Levine:  They're really both  extremists if you look at it, Ryan and Fontaine.  Ryan believes in this  thing completely, and Fontaine believes in nothing.  At the end of the  day, they're almost equally dangerous.  \[Fontaine\] is a nihilist, all he  cares about is himself.  He has something missing in him that makes us  human.*    
>  
>*Fontaine is the only real monster in the game, because he has no  ideals at all, and all Ryan has is ideal.  I play with this a lot in all  the games I do, whether it's back to Thief where you have the pagans  and the fundamentalists, and you feel sort of in the middle.  I think  Fontaine's an empty human.  That's what happens when you have nothing.*  

You are the radical here. I'm not an objectivist. I'm a moderate libertarian, or centrist who leans libertarian. You are an anarchic communist. Bioshock 2 has a critique for you too, buddy.
        I wish I could upvote this more. A dev with a skin deep understanding of Rand's ideas like in this sub would not have been able to represent it so well, with as much nuance. Plus what, it was the 00s, the subject matter wasn't remotely as offensive as it is now. I've read her shit several times but still ride the fence on a lot of it, but it is conceptually fascinating. I loved the game, bc i saw way, way more than "freedom=bad". The larger takeaway seemed to me to be "absolute power corrupts absolutely" but I like that point about Fontaine not having ideals. I'll have to play through again now with that in mind
            I think the game also tries to make you ride the fence on the subject. Despite Ryan being a villain, he is not the main villain and you can understand his actions. He did what he did to protect the city. 

And Rapture does seem like an awesome place to live (before the war of course), it's no wonder the city sticks in our head. A fictional place that is real in our mind (like Middle Earth, for example). 

You can understand the characters's decisions. And the story is written in such a way that any decision they took would lead to ruin, one way or the other. It is a tragic story.
                It's excellent and complicated. They did a phenomenal job. Especially with the first one.
The game serves perfectly as an example of why objectivism/utopian unregulated capitalism wouldn't work. Andrew (Ayn) Ryan (Rand) perfectly represents Ayn Rand herself including backstory, ideals and name and he is the cowardly villain in the game. The game also spewers you with capitalist and objectivist propaganda portrayed in a bad light. Ken Levine's single reply is literally the only thing pointing towards something else than a critique of objectivism
    See, you have the superficial analysis that most players have. When you analise the story in depth, you see that is much more complicated than that. 

Ryan was a hypocrite. He banned trade and communication with the outside world. He nationalised Fontaine's Futuristics. He continued the Little Sister program (created by Fontaine) and he created the Big Daddy program. He even used pheromones to control the minds of splicers. 

He wasn't following his ideology, neither was any of the main characters. So the city couldn't have fallen due to objectivism or unregulated capitalism. Those weren't being followed. 

What lead to the city's downfall was the power struggle between Ryan and Fontaine/Atlas. Fontaine got rich through smuggling. Which was only possible due to Ryan banning trade with the surface. Atlas only "showed up" because Ryan needed Fontaine dead. Fontaine/Atlas was only capable of creating his army by using Fontaine's charities. 

None of this is the result of objectivist philosophy. The only thing that is, is the unregulated Adam. And even that is a fictional thing.

Ryan's philosophy allowed for competition where the free market equalized advantage if the writers ever were consistent when such things got in the way of their twist-forced plot
    The problem with the writing is actually that it's System Shock but under water and with genetics instead of psyhonics with a lot of Neoliberalism thrown in for good mesure
        I never played System Shock to make any comparison, though Ive heard alot of the elements are very similar.

Apparently the production of the original BioShock was changed significantly in its last year  after playtesting revealed major shortcomings.

The second BioShock game followed the first in concept and mechanisms, and I don't remember it being mentioned that they had any rush situations.  That ontop of also doing Multiplayer and then Minervas Den 

Infinite was significantly rewritten 2/3 times and huge chunks of effort were abandoned.   The game elements were similar, some missing, others simplified -- so that shouldn't have taken that much time away.   With the story/setting moved far further into Fantasy, I found it odd they continued to make believe it was a reflection of the Real World as the interviews claimed.    I saw no 'shock' that was supposed to change things, as the play was a Flying Reactionary Cult Compound from the start, and could have just as well been on the ground.   The Tears could have been 'the shock',  but weren't much utilized.

.
            The entire twist in Bioshock is the same as in System Shock, there are a lot of other things that are simular or identical, if I have to choose between SS and BS I will pick SS every day of the week as it's core concept is how corporate greed have twisted and made a hyper intelligent AI crazy only because the company that owns it wants to evade paying taxes
            >Infinite was significantly rewritten 2/3 times and huge chunks of effort were abandoned.   The game elements were similar, some missing, others simplified -- so that shouldn't have taken that much time away.

Tell me more!
Hey, Jackass. Why don't you listen to the [creator of the game himself](https://www.shacknews.com/article/48728/ken-levine-on-bioshock-the) ?

> *Ken Levine:  I'm fascinated by  Objectivism.  I think I gave it--I think the problem with any philosophy  is that it's up to people to carry it out.  It could have been  Objectivism, it could have been anything.  It's about what happens when  ideals meet reality.  If you had to sum up BioShock's story, that's what  it is.*    
>  
>*When philosophers write books, when they write fictional works  like Atlas Shrugged, they put paragons in the books to carry out their  ideals.  I always wanted to tell a story of, what if a guy wasn't a  paragon?  What if his intentions were really good, but at the end of the  day he was human?  I think that's where the problem is.*    
>  
>*It's not an attack on Objectivism, it's a fair look at humanity.   We screw things up. We're very, very fallible.  You have this  beautiful, beautiful city, and then what happens when reality meets the  ideals?  The visual look of the city is the ideals, and the water coming  in is reality.  It could have been Objectivism, it could have been  anything.*    
>  
>*Shack:  The plot really has a  major dynamic shift from Ryan to Fontaine in the last third of the game.   Is that part of a suggestion that it's not the philosophy that's  fundamentally at fault as much as a failure of all its participants to  play along?*    
>  
>*Ken Levine:  They're really both  extremists if you look at it, Ryan and Fontaine.  Ryan believes in this  thing completely, and Fontaine believes in nothing.  At the end of the  day, they're almost equally dangerous.  \[Fontaine\] is a nihilist, all he  cares about is himself.  He has something missing in him that makes us  human.*    
>  
>*Fontaine is the only real monster in the game, because he has no  ideals at all, and all Ryan has is ideal.  I play with this a lot in all  the games I do, whether it's back to Thief where you have the pagans  and the fundamentalists, and you feel sort of in the middle.  I think  Fontaine's an empty human.  That's what happens when you have nothing.*  

You are the radical here. I'm not an objectivist. I'm a moderate libertarian, or centrist who leans libertarian. You are an anarchic communist. Bioshock 2 has a critique for you too, buddy.
    I wish I could upvote this more. A dev with a skin deep understanding of Rand's ideas like in this sub would not have been able to represent it so well, with as much nuance. Plus what, it was the 00s, the subject matter wasn't remotely as offensive as it is now. I've read her shit several times but still ride the fence on a lot of it, but it is conceptually fascinating. I loved the game, bc i saw way, way more than "freedom=bad". The larger takeaway seemed to me to be "absolute power corrupts absolutely" but I like that point about Fontaine not having ideals. I'll have to play through again now with that in mind
        I think the game also tries to make you ride the fence on the subject. Despite Ryan being a villain, he is not the main villain and you can understand his actions. He did what he did to protect the city. 

And Rapture does seem like an awesome place to live (before the war of course), it's no wonder the city sticks in our head. A fictional place that is real in our mind (like Middle Earth, for example). 

You can understand the characters's decisions. And the story is written in such a way that any decision they took would lead to ruin, one way or the other. It is a tragic story.
            It's excellent and complicated. They did a phenomenal job. Especially with the first one.
See, you have the superficial analysis that most players have. When you analise the story in depth, you see that is much more complicated than that. 

Ryan was a hypocrite. He banned trade and communication with the outside world. He nationalised Fontaine's Futuristics. He continued the Little Sister program (created by Fontaine) and he created the Big Daddy program. He even used pheromones to control the minds of splicers. 

He wasn't following his ideology, neither was any of the main characters. So the city couldn't have fallen due to objectivism or unregulated capitalism. Those weren't being followed. 

What lead to the city's downfall was the power struggle between Ryan and Fontaine/Atlas. Fontaine got rich through smuggling. Which was only possible due to Ryan banning trade with the surface. Atlas only "showed up" because Ryan needed Fontaine dead. Fontaine/Atlas was only capable of creating his army by using Fontaine's charities. 

None of this is the result of objectivist philosophy. The only thing that is, is the unregulated Adam. And even that is a fictional thing.

The game's genius storytelling serves to show us things are more complicated than they first seem. From the beginning of the game we are lead to believe that Ryan is the villain. Later we realize that he is not the main villain. Fontaine is. And Fontaine doesn't even believe in anything. Ryan is still a villain, but his actions are still understandable.
    Quite the interesting analysis, and you defiently bring a lot of good points to the table, but for me, it still serves as a monument towards the imminent failure of all utopian ideologies, be it objectivism (bioshock 1), communism (bioshock 2) and whatever Colombia is (theocracy? Monarcy? Extreme Patriotism?)
        >it still serves as a monument towards the imminent failure of all utopian ideologies

But it really is. That's what Ken Levine was trying to say.
            Yes, and bioshock 1 is for the imminent failure of Ayn Rand's nonsensical ideologies, also known as objectivism.
    >  He banned trade and communication with the outside world.

what dont you get about 'secret city' ?

Google cold war  and atomic war if you want to understand the reasons for it all.
        I know. That's why I said his actions were understandable.
Or you join the Rapture Militia get issued guns and not Plasmids, get organized and slaughter the Splicers.

If all else fails the Splicer bastions get closed off and their heat and air turned off til they are all dead.
    But there were also civilians caught in the cross fire. People who needed to protect their business and their families. What are you gonna do when the whole city is in chaos and looting ?
        in a terror warzone those things largely cease or move to subsistence and bunkerism.   They are NOT normal times.

Civilians? Who arent supporting Ryan and ORDER ?  Most would say "RYAN PLEASE kill all these terrorists!!!" and then join the militia, if anything just to protect themselves.  Ryan then secures the city section by section and wipes the anarchist/terrorist/rebels out.   By the time of Bioshock thats basically what had happened. Pheromone Control neutralized Atlas's army and he was hiding in his spiderhole.

BTW What exactly did Atlas offer that normal people would want?  Anarchy is not a basis for survival for the people in Rapture, and many of them went there to GET AWAY FROM the likes of Atlas.
            Yeah, you know. I was under the impression that the parts of the city we play in during the game are the parts that were cut off by Ryan. And the rest of the city is still functioning properly with people working and living their lives. 

But I'm not so sure of that. When Ryan decides to make the player kill him, it appears as if everything was already lost.
Rhetorically people have used "free market" to justify not having taxes or regulation on their income/wealth/power. Ryan in Bioshock wanted to force people to not provide any charity. 

And the market in Bioshock certainly was not free as Ryan had a hand in everything and tried to crush competition along with banning media from the surface world. 

Without any rules, Rapture ended up a state with monopolies only, certainly not free. And with rules, many market actors would consider the market unfree as well.
    I understand now. Anyway, my point is Bioshock was a lot more nuanced than just ‚Äúlibertarian bad.‚Äù It had a lot of interesting factors that led to the downfall of rapture, not just the free markets. Was it a criticism of Ayn Rand? 100%. But it was done in good faith and is an incredible game series.
        I 100% agree with your statement. The inequality combined with a new technology released unfettered into the society was what I see the main reason why Rapture fell.
    But Ryan didn't force people to not provide any charity. Fontaine had his charities. Ryan just didn't trust that because he thought it made people feel entitled and it could be used to manipulate people, which it did.
And they were also killing random people for their Adam. I still don't see how that's the market self regulating in a positive way. And I say this as a moderate libertarian.
    Its not a positive way. Lets not forget that Bioshock is a critical fiction, so the writers wrote the Splicers reaction. As a libertarian, I disagree that the markets would react in such a violent way. I was merely drawing the line that the Splicers were a part of the market. People often forget that Adam Smith‚Äôs ‚Äúinvisible hand of the market‚Äù are just people who participate in a market. The splicers participated, albeit in a violent way. I however, disagree that the markets would retaliate to such an extreme. It is likely rather that people would simply cease patronizing such a character as Andrew Ryan.
        >Lets not forget that Bioshock is a critical fiction, so the writers wrote the Splicers reaction.

It's funny that you said that, because the critic Ken Levine had with Atlas Shrugged is that she can write whatever she wants. Characters behave perfectly in Gault's Gulch. 

Ken Levine asked himself "What if the characters weren't paragons but were instead, fallible people, just like in real life ?". 

Granted, he was thinking about Andrew Ryan, Fontaine, Tenenbaum, Sochong, etc. Characters that weren't following the objectivist ideology because of their greed, hubris and hypocrisy.  

The splicers were just the sci fi version of that. That is, how would someone follow an ideology of rational decision making if they are incapable of thinking rationally ?
            I never figured out in Atlas Shrugged how all that success in Galts Gulch was supposed to scale to an entire country.  People inclined to its social systems came there voluntarily, but outside are a whole lot of people who had the socialism ingrained in their lives and those beholden to it and very many would have to change from that to adopt the same objectivism.

Overcoming that inertia was to be the biggest problem.
