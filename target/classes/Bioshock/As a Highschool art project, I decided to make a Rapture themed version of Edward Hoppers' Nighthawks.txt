[[As a Highschool art project, I decided to make a Rapture themed version of Edward Hoppers' Nighthawks]]





Dope as fuck 
    Glad you like it!

UPDATE FOR ANYONE INTERESTED: First off, thanks for the kind words and encouragement, what I thought would only get the attention of like 5 people really Boomed and even got first page on the subreddit, you guys are awesome!

To clear up some confusion: This is a digital artwork, made with Photoshop, not a painting as many believe. It looks partially drawn, because it was part of the assignment.

As for selling Prints: 16 y/o me would've never imagined people actually wanting to buy stuff that I created. Needless to say that now, I'm positively surprised by the sheer amount of people wanting to have a print of this! I'll do my best to revise this piece, taking all of your feedback into consideration while doing so, making it for practice. If there's higher demand I'll post an Update to everyone responding to this comment or writing me a PM about the eventual sale of this.

[Update of an Update (my remaster)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bioshock/comments/86mq0l/last_week_i_showed_you_my_highschool_art_project/)
        I'd love to have a print of this.  I wouldn't focus too much on updates, this is your interpretation.
        I need a fucking priiiiiiint, maybe two !!!!!!!!!!!! I need them more than Eve or infrared grenades. Give me sooome!!!
        Yes!  Please update here if you sell prints.  I would love one and I'm sure you'd get a lot of orders.
        lookin for them prints boy
        I'd love a print of this too. 
        I'd love to be updated if you end up selling prints!
        Please let me know! This is super great!
        Nice work, would be great to be able to get a print of this
        Wow I would pay money to have a print of this. I hope you get something figured out where you can sell these. I'm sure someone somewhere would sponsor you or whatever. Let me know!! 
        Would absolutely love to purchase a print!
        Yeah I would definitely like to buy one of these. Update this post or even pm me if you get sales going. 
        If you cropped and printed it on a mousepad I'd buy one.
        Add me to your list of: people who will throw money at you for prints. 
        Yes, let me know how much a poster or something would be, sizes you can make, and how much it would be. Thanks! 
        This is a wonderful take on the original while being original enough in itself to warrant a printing. I'd definitely love to have this on my wall
        Would purchase!
        I would adore a print of this! Amazing work friend! 
        Cool. I hope you get prints figured out
        Is the artist not entitled to the sweat of his brow? ;) 
        Ahhh this is sick, let me know if you end up selling prints!!
        This combines my favorite painting and my favorite series. It's a great piece. Would defiantly get a print. 
        Yeah I would 100% buy this. It's like you read my mind.
*re-installs Bioshock*
    Wait, you uninstalled it? Heathen.
        Would it help if I say I’ve beat it 3 times? It’s by far my all time favorite game. I like to go back and play the trilogy once a year. Currently reading the book, Rapture, and seeing this photo made me want to go back into the world and mostly just explore.

Ps, highly recommend the book. Has very good back story to help answer some stuff they don’t really explain in the games.
            I've read the book as well, it's awesome. 
                I’m about halfway through now. Makes me sad the team disbanded. I wish we could have had one more bioshock in Rapture. 
love the concept, love the work..

can i play critic? cause there are a couple things that stick out to me that you can tweak real easy.

also, neon? try [here](http://abduzeedo.com/node/13368) for a good guide
    Sure, go ahead.
16 y/o me would've appreciated any feedback for it (despite getting an A on it).
Also thanks for the guide!
        if i were a teacher i would give you an A too.. you have good concept and good sense of proportion/shape... however

That yellow wall sticks out too much; in the original, the buildings across the street have a facade that matches the bar/counter.. it keeps the yellow in check.. the crack was a good attempt, but its perspective is a tiny bit off.. [and doesn't really tone the yellow down]

consider a [mask with a texture](https://forums.adobe.com/thread/1683813) to make the wall damaged... [and way way less bright]

also masks on top of hats? that's too much of a stretch... pick one.. splicer or citizen..

that would make the transition totally realistic
            Thanks for the feedback, I can see the points you're making and i'll definitely take them into consideration, once I'll decide to revisit this piece for improvement.

As for the hats/masks thing: I was sure that neither my teacher (nor the rest of my class) had ever heard/seen Bioshock or knew what Splicers are, so I left them like this, so people can recognize the original work behind it (most people I showed it to just thought i'd be Underwater or Atlantis Nighthawks). For more clarification on the "why" of the masks I added the masquerade ball poster. 
                all good man... i've been spoiled by exploring really well designed games.. i love where you're going with merging the two images together.. those two things would make the immersion perfect... like i would see that in the game and think.. hey look at that; that's a hopper!
                    This was the most wholesome art thread I've ever seen
            >also masks on top of hats? that's too much of a stretch... pick one.. splicer or citizen..

Bruh, ADAM has revolutionized headwear. Try the new gene tonic that allows you to wear a mask and a hat. Coming next year, the improved version will allow you to wear glasses on top of the mask and hat!
    Not OP but guide is cool, ty
Feedback is very Welcome!
An idea I wanted to implement (but couldn't because of deadlines and lack of skill) was to turn the "Phillies" sign at top into Neon writing, any tutorials on it would be very appreciated!
    Simplest option I can think of is creating a stroked version of the text and then adding a glow to it. Put a drop shadow behind it to give it some depth and separation from the background since neon is usually projecting from the fixed surface. If you want something a little fancier and detailed, you could offset another stroke and selectively burn/erase parts of it to create highlights on the tubing where it turns, etc.

Some other suggestions: the perspective on the buildings seems a little wonky, not sure if you were trying to distort it to give the impression of water distortion or it's just the result of using a skybox from the game.

Also, the whale should be as dark as the buildings, not lighter. Even if it's a white whale at that distance with that much water it'd read as a dark shape not light. 

Another tweak that would make it feel more like rapture is adjusting the interior lighting. In Rapture the seawater gives off a strong blue-green tint, so even with the bright interior lighting some of that color spill would still be seen in the interior and on the backs of the patrons.

But those are my nitpicks. Cool idea and a cool result!
Just casually let me paint a something for highschool. Just a little something not to crazy. Psh I couldn’t even color that with a paint by numbers. Looks fantastic!
    To be fair, it's more of a shop than a painting, but thanks for the humble words anyway! 


        Yeah haha I maybe an engineer but it doesn’t mean I can use photoshop at all :)
            Maybe an engineer?
                As in, me as a person, as an engineer, may have difficulties using PhotoShop
                    Sorry i was making a joke. You may be an engineer, not maybe an engineer
                        See this is why I’m an Engineer. I English so so
This painting always reminds me of Tom Waits' song "Eggs and Sausage"

https://youtu.be/SDo1617aXX4
One of my favorite paintings combined with one of my favorite games!
Awfully edited, but ok
Do you sell prints!?
I still draw stick people. I'm 24. You have talent! Must've taken a lot of work.
    Hi 24, I'm dad!
        Oh my god as if this exists
            [r/ofcoursethatsathing](https://www.reddit.com/r/ofcoursethatsathing/)
    It's just two pictures put together, it's not that big of a deal.
But it all looks like it was done with a computer? 
You know how sometimes weird coincidences happen that you can't explain. Well I'm not American and I had never heard of/seen the original painting before (at least not that I can recall).

Last night I randomly decided to watch That 70's Show which I only watched a handful of times in college but never in order. I started from the beginning, and one episode in Season 1 was where Foreman's parents went to Phillies for dinner and the last scene is them in this painting, and I thought to myself "Oh thats a cool painting" and now I see it again on my Reddit homepage less than 24 hours later and I got that little feeling of ooo this is weird.

Anyways just wanted to share that with you but cool art man! Digging it

OP are you selling this? Open up a shop!
    Seconded! 
Great stuff but there are splicers right? How these Adam's junkie can be so peacefull? Anyway is nice.
I like it a lot. The one question I have is why the broken glass when it looks like it takes place before the civil war broke out?
    Could be every Day wear and tear, and the big daddies haven’t gotten around to fixing it yet. 
Havent I seen this one before?
    My friend has a print he bought at a convention that was the same concept. He didn’t know the artist unfortunately 
        I really have seen it before. And I still dont know the name of it. Drives me slightly mad.
This is truly wonderful 
This is actualy insane.
Good work man!
wow, that is sweet!
thats awesome!
So ducking cool bro 
Splendid!!
If you do prints, I'll definitely buy one.
This is incredible. What program did you use?
Commenting so that I can stay up-to-date on buying prints!
That is nothing short of amazing...
Wow
What happened
Oh my god I want a copy of this. It’s amazing!!
I would buy this... Any possibility?
Repost, dumbfuck.
    Is it? If so, what's the original source?
        Reddit's search function is your friend.
This is fantastic. My favorite game and art piece finally combined. 
I would definitely want to frame this if I was able to get a print.
Awesome work dude! I'm excited to see you do more art like this in the future!
This is the coolest thing I’ve seen on the internet all month. 
holy shit, I fucking love this. Can I use this as my computer background please?
    sure go ahead, it's not like i could stop you ;)

Is it a multimedia project?
Wouldn't the chef not have a mask on?
Pretty good! 
How did you become a Highschool art project?
When you said Rapture, I all the people were going to be gone, and in their place were neatly folded piles of their clothes.
Awesome
This is a great piece! You made that place look like a real dive 
Can I get a creme filled cake and a slice of splicer’s pie please, thank you. 
One of my favorite paintings.
It’s creepy.  I want a print as well.  Keep us posted
I would say I second the want for prints, but it looks like I’m way past being the second person, I really love your mix here op, let us know if you sell, or decide to do any cool mashups like this. Fantastic.
Wow that's awesome! Love love love it! 
The dude sitting next to the ginger, his mask is way off. Maybe swap their masks? Good job so far though
Gorgeous!
I had to analyse the fucking original painting in school it still gives me nightmares, I just can't see any deeper meaning in the original painting..
But great remake from you, way better than the original 
Looks great dude!  Also this is the most upvotes I've seen on any post on this sub in a long time.
Lovely!
Love it, need it.


I would love a print of this also. Wow, it is fantastic
Holy Shit that's really cool, I'd frame it
1. Can i post this to my Facebook page?
2. How can i credit you
3. Is there somewhere we can follow your artwork?
I love it. Absolutely love it.
I love this! I would get a print of this.
That’s awesome! 
This is awesome, but I would LOVE a version that was actually painted over, so that it would match the style better. Right now the masks and cracks really stand out 
I'm 100% in love
I need it
Good job
Holy shit this is great, you have real talent
OH MY GOSH I WANT THIS>
spot on 
Top notch! 
This is amazing!! 😍
This is STUNNING. Best variation of Nighthawks I’ve ever seen. Could totally picture that café being just one of the endless possible set pieces in the massive skyscrapers (seascrapers??) you see deep in the background of any exterior view of Rapture. 

I’m currently assembling a mini bar in my living room and theming it on Casablanca and Bioshock. I would LOVE to frame this image and place it above the bar if you’d be willing to share a high quality version of it. 
    Do you have any pics? That sounds really cool.
Reposttt
This is spectacular
This is amazing. Great work! 
That is awesome!
Sweet! Great work!
Love the detail on that whale 10/10
This is fantastic!
What a great idea! Love it!
I would hang this on my wall. Great job!
I would hang this on my wall
Good Job!

A+
Looks awesome, I would to have a print of this to go with my Bioshock art collection.
That’s amazing. Nice job! If I were you, I’d set up an Etsy account and sell it. 
How much for a print of this? 
I’m just putting it out there id definitely
but a print of this. Pls deliver OP
Seeing some haters here. 

I enjoy it and would be interested in buying some sort of print of this if that's a possibility. 
As an art history major I approve very much. You did a great job. 
I need this as a print I can hang on my wall
I want this framed in my game room!
this is absolutely amazing, i’m in love with it, and i literally can’t stop staring at it :)
[deleted]
    ಠ_ಠ
This is incredible. I want it
Hell yes this is sick af. I want a print of this in my office.
This is one of the best takes on this piece that I've ever seen. Major props!
Absolutely terrific. I'd buy a print.
Very nice 
Wonderful piece of project.
This is SUPER FANTASTIC!
It's wonderful 
Holy shit. That's sickkkkkk
amazing
That’s fantastic 
This just made my all time favorite art piece even better.
Fuck. I wanna buy this like yesterday 
This looks super cool omg
I'd hang that as a giant poster on my wall, its amazing! good job
Awesome painting, background looks like something from bioshock.
    Rapture is the city from BioShock.
        Oh shit I’m dumb lol I played the game with my dad a while ago and didn’t remember the city’s name 😂
[deleted]
    The task of the assignment was to make a spoof of a famous painting, since i saw there wasn't one about Bioshock, i thought to myself: Why not?
Nighthawks is my favourite piece of art.

This is a great mash-up!
That is beautiful!
This is awesome, a remastered version would be cool to if you got Better in art over the years
Who can animate something
Officially the background on my phone. This is awesome
I love this so much! I love all the cool art that comes from this game!
Remaster this now that you have presumably graduated.
You’re talented bro. Looks great btw

For more clarification on the "why" of the masks I added the masquerade ball poster. 
    all good man... i've been spoiled by exploring really well designed games.. i love where you're going with merging the two images together.. those two things would make the immersion perfect... like i would see that in the game and think.. hey look at that; that's a hopper!
        This was the most wholesome art thread I've ever seen
>also masks on top of hats? that's too much of a stretch... pick one.. splicer or citizen..

Bruh, ADAM has revolutionized headwear. Try the new gene tonic that allows you to wear a mask and a hat. Coming next year, the improved version will allow you to wear glasses on top of the mask and hat!
Maybe an engineer?

        Sorry i was making a joke. You may be an engineer, not maybe an engineer
            See this is why I’m an Engineer. I English so so

I’m about halfway through now. Makes me sad the team disbanded. I wish we could have had one more bioshock in Rapture.
