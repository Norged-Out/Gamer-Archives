[[The curse of Valve's engine will follow the series no matter what engine Respawn switches over]]





Just call it Titanfall: Alyx. Then you can also collab with half life.
    Titanfall: Lastimosa
        Oh fuck that's actually a great idea. Playing as Lastimosa during his time as a pilot would be great to establish more about him and BT.
            Call it Titanfall: The Presequel as well
                Titanfall: Before the fall
                    Titan: Events leading to the fall
                        Finish up with the sequel Titanfell
                    Lawsuit because Attack on Titan: Before The Fall
                The Titan Wars could be a genuinely decent prequel setting, they're mentioned multiple times at least in Titanfall 1 and it's not too far in the past as Barker fought in it so stuff shouldn't be entirely unfamiliar

The tech would have to be a couple decades older than TF|2 though
                Titanfall: Lastimosa: The Presequel - TLTP for short.

I bet Respawn would rather do that then name the next game 3.
                    Because Source Engine games aren't allowed to have the number 3 in the title.
            no joke, tf3 campaign could have like black ops series flashbacks to the past curing the BT origins lore. If they ever do tf3 I hope they do a campaign at least 2x longer than tf2's
    Titanfall: Global Offensive
    Titanfall VR would be revolutionary

*Edit: and definitely vomit inducing but thats ok
        Playing as papa scorch in vr has been a dream of mine for a while. Iâ€™ll build a haptic rig to simulate the walking if they ever actually do it
    Titanfall : Jack

Titanfall : BT
    VR titanfall, aka the vomit comet
Hear me out, we just have to wait for source 3.
    I look forward to my great grandchildren being able to enjoy Titanfall 3.

Something has to break the curse. Remember no pills
Thatâ€™s the hardest pic ever
    AI believe it or not. Other pictures from this set include him chilling with the gators and eating slices of pizza with them. At some point, things turn and he's roundhousing gators.
        Gators lost a bet and didnâ€™t pay up
All we're getting is Titanfall 2 episode 1 and Titanfall 2 episode 2
What if Respawn tweeted an incredibly obvious Titanfall 3 reference like "I just lov3 titanfall 2! Wish w3 could mak3 a s3qu3l" This subreddit would just go up in flames instantly.

Edit: tweeded -> tweeted
    And then just sat on their hands and did nothing.  Imagine the need for psychiatric care after that.
    That would have five occurrences of the number 3, therefore making it suspect of being a hoax. But "I just lov3 Titanfall 2 - Lov3 R3spawn" would work
There are three monarch upgrades therefore there will be a Titanfall 3
Ok but Titanfall 3 in Source 2 tho ðŸ¤¤
    We kiddnapping the people who are working on building tf2 in source 2 (After the S&Box stop updating the engine three times a week the tf:source 2 can't keep up)
Respawn is just waiting for Valve to give them a copy of the keys to Source Engine 2 before they officially start developing Titan Fall 3.
they can ask valve for source 2 now, maybe we get titanfall: BT in VR then
What about titanfall 2 part 2?
Solution: switch to the engine that Apex uses
    Well have I got news for you.
        I didnâ€™t realize that Apex uses the Source Engine lol sorry
            *Technically* Apex's engine is a heavily modified version of Source. The basis is still there but there's been a ton of changes been made to it to the point it's considered its own thing but yes technically still Source.
    :(
That's a terrible image but I'm glad someone finally said it
