[[Found all the dead pilotos in TF2 campaign]]


I took the trouble to look for the bodies of deceased pilots throughout the entire campaign, since almost nothing is said about them, it was difficult for me to find them but I managed it, and there are a total of 12, all of them pulse blade classes


All are pulse pilots, unsurprisingly
    Stims and Pulses get shat on for some reason in the campaign
        I shit on them in multiplayerâ€¦.grapple supremacy
             Tbh I've gotten more executions as pulse and Cloak than any other class, prefer them too asthetically
                Everyone has their play style. But the amount of cloak pilots that think I canâ€™t see themâ€¦ðŸ˜¬
                    oh yeah its best used when everything is chaotic and people are less focused. rushing someone likely won't work unless they're really not paying attention, I've definitely killed quite a few cloaks, even meleed cloakers while we both were in cloak

Sniper+ cloaks+ low profile however are matches made in heaven
                        I had a mate who accused people of hacking and tried to justify his kd of 0.04 as he was running up to people with cloak trying to execute

Then he'd insist he was better than me...

Dude didn't even know about low profile "No obvious effect = useless"
                            That's hilarious and depressing.

How do you get executions btw? I tried it a few times and either do a simple melee or nothing happens, do I need to back-stab them?

And I never even thought about using cloak to get executions, I've always used the cloak + sachels technique to suicide-bomb random corridors (and then play mind-games when the enemy team catches on and starts taking alternate routes to sneak up on me). Or to simply make myself a harder target to hit in a 1v1 (though I find holo pilot does this best).
                                You go behind them then hold the melee button :)
                                    Thanks!

Now I understand the usefulness of cloak pilot for this task
                            LMFAO
Idr my k/d its low iirc, but I usually aim to get at least 5-10, my peak currently is 21 at most
                    Played fire fight as cloak and someone said "You're different in the best kind of way"    

Unironically helped me get my execution goal of 50 in 3 days.
                    you would be surprised the amount of pulse pilots who forget their pulse doesent last forever.  


then again, i play exclusively cloak because i love the giant bulky look on a guy going 40km/h. then again, i also love how the "gender" is more a question of "do you want a dust cover for your legs or not?"
                    Damn man I think I have bad eyes or something when these moa fugga cloak I canâ€™t see em
                Well makes sense y u get more as cloak, sneaky bastard
                    Ironically, pulse carries more than cloak, but cloak does allow me to traverse terrain without getting sniped
                As a g12.40 or so cloak main I can agree to this:)
            bold words for someone who's about to have a knife trickshotted into their skull midswing
                False, I hovered mid swing and mag dumped that pretty helmet of yours. Did I mention Iâ€™m a car main ðŸ˜”
                    Now youre a sitting duck for my laser core
                        As a tone main, I hope you stub your toe
            No we Cloak Sisters supremacy.
            [removed]
        I try to execute Phase Shifters because I like to pretend they're enemy pilots
        They reused the phase shift model for the enemies that deploy drones/ticks
    In seriousness it's because the pulse blade pilot is supposed to be a militia pilot. They have the same colour scheme as the militia grunts.
        I never knew this!
    And people say holo pilot is the worst
Damn pulse blade pilots need to step their game up.
    Those are militia pilot colors, probably standard pilot armor as well
Pulse blade canonically the worst kit /s
    Canonically, all pilots have access to all abilities.

Edit: thinking about it, cloak + stim would be a terrifying combo
        I am approaching you at mach 1

*and you wonâ€™t even see me*
            if you arent appearing, cant be seen which means you are just dark matter at this point with absolutely bo resistance to any force whatsoever, you would technically just see darkness as light wouldnt even catch up to you
                Im pretty sure you would see light incoming from ahead of you, but looking behind would be dark
                    However with absolutely zero resistance to any force, you would literally escape light and not see anything, so technically i stand correct, or am i stupid?(not being rude but like just funny you know)
                        Uhhh I dont blame you for thinking it lol the actual thing is really weird. 

So basically, you're seeing everything in the past by like fractions of a second. Light takes time to travel from the point where it bounces off the thing and then goes to you, but it travels that distance super fast. If someone were going faster than light, they would be invisible since the light can't keep up, but would be able to see you since the light is going towards them instead of trying to race them.

(I am not scientist tho so take with plentiful salt)
                            SO PILOTS WITH CLOAK ARE JUST DARK MATTER THAT CAN CONTROL THIER SPEED
        I've thought about how it would play out if we could swap our ordnance for another ability. I love my satchels, but things would get spicy if I could run Pulse and Grapple
            Phase and stim

You literally appear from thin air
            Grapple kraber players are already challenging enough. Let's not give them wall hacks
        I mean, Lastimosa had all of the abilities except for the ones that would break the human body
        What I'd give for Stim and Phase Shift
        Has that been stated somewhere? I know Lastimosa used Pulse Blade, Grapple, and Holo Pilot in the intro so they get at least three.
            Think I heard it mentioned by the guy who made the Bangalore vs pilot animation in the bts video

Last photo looks like a vacuum cleaner robot mourning for it's owner's death
    "Goodbye Jack"
    Fuck it, we grapple
BT I found Andersonâ€¦
    FANTASTIC MISSION COMPLETE, GREAT VICTORY, WELL DONE PILOT
        That right there is why you're the best, Pilot!
            The one and only!

*S rank*
        That's cold BT
    He's... uh... in the ceiling.
I'm more curious to know how the pilots see through that mesh into their helmets
    They may be using the same technology for helmets as for pilot-titan connection
        I don't know maybe it would make sense
    I wonder if itâ€™s similar to how I used to stretch a mesh type shirt over my eyes as a kid
        It looks too thick or made out of some type of leather mix with the mesh parts
            Probably, the shirt Iâ€™m wearing rn looks heavy but can easily be seen through, it just makes it darker
                Still I don't know
                    Always fun to imagine and question
                        True but still I don't know lol
    It would be like seeing the same way outside your titan or stuff like the tech the F-35 uses, there's sensors likely on the outside of the helmet that collab with those little thing on the mesh they wear over it, and considering neural linking it may work that same way so it kinda just transmits that information from those sensors to their brain and to their eyes or smt idk
        Well it's witch craft to me till the day I die
    Most likely the same way Spartans see through their helmets. Cameras placed through out the helmet.
        Maybe
    I wondered how Rorschach from Watchmen sees.
Fucking rip pulse blade lmao
Those pulse blade pilots just can't catch a break, can they?
The devs might have a vendetta against me lmao
    Flair checks up
A bunch of them are in the exact same pose, also
    welcome to game design lol
        Nah frr
    golden Freddy pose lmao
        NAH IT LITERALLLY IS
Found a holopilot corpse in the campaign once but when I got closer it disappeared
    "*Right Behind You*"
rest in peace slouched over pulse pilot that has his left hand on knee and right hand on floor, head tilted to the right. youll be missed, its a shame you dies so many times
Bro what did the pulse blade pilots do to deserve this
Damn they really donâ€™t like Pulse Blade pilots apparently
The 5th one is cute. A pilot dies next to his/her titan.
I wonder, do all the visors glow / are visible to the naked eye or only other pilots

I wonder if the visors serve as a sort of vitals reader so you know if your buddy is dead if his visor is black so you don't waste time trying to haul a dead body
    Most likely a sort of vital information and an identification marking. Why enemies lights appear red and friendlies look blue
Why is there so many dead pulse blade pilots lol?
Man, they just really did NOT like pulse pilots.
as a pulse main, i think i am ever so slightly concerned
No major Anderson and captain lastimosia (idk how to spell)
    I believe it's spelt "Last Mimosa"
        Hqhahahhahha definitely not
Last guys just sleeping
All their crooked head/necks. Reminds me of a dog being confused
Pulse pilots are universally shit on apparently, from both developers and the community
Pulse pilots stay losing ðŸ˜”
Looks like being O+ is a requirement to be a pilot
Note to self don't run pulse
Almost all of them are pulse pilots. What do the devs have against pulse pilots?
I just play Pulse Blade because he looks cool. Please stop bullying my main
seem like respawn don't like pulseblade
didnâ€™t viper have a pulse helmetâ€¦ðŸ˜…
It's a mesh infused with black magic
Why am I not surprised that it is the pulse knife? XD

I say practically all the pilots except the pulse knife their ability to search, save your life, while the pulse knife seeks to get you to kill as much as possible.

Here's a quick tip if you use it, put in as many skill recharges as possible, and any secondary options (I highly recommend titan hunter and stealth), fire grenade, gravity are the easiest to use, As for weapons, any assault rifle or submachine gun will do, but not a shotgun because the capes are too far away and unless you can hip-fire a sniper, I wouldn't use them. Regarding pistols (pripatias) it is more a matter of taste, just like grenade launchers, they are useful, but if you read this I will assume that you are not even G2 and you have no skill... If you like them, go ahead. Finally, be prepared to have no other security options than your mobility.
No Lastimosa.

List incomplete.
    Darn ðŸ’€, i forgor
Femboy pilot completely ruined all pilots for me. Everywhere I go I see his face.
They could have made it like in Halo Infinite campaign - each time when you found your fallen in battle brother - you main character will pay respect, take his ID and probably will learn some new ability from his data - like A-wall, hologram, etc.
I like how a lot of them have the same general stance/model lol  
Cool post though!
Goddamn noobs smh
Titanfall 12 confirmed ???
Damn that helmet type must be really popular
Looks like they were trying to get the execution
omg what is this 12k resolution
9 is a grapple pilot
    no 9 is a militia assault pilot, which you cant be in multiplayer unfortunately
        It is kind of, the Militia Assault Pilot helmet is the one that Jack and Lastimosa wear also Lt Shaver/Freeborn, it is one of them, the other wears an IMC Assault helmet. Anyways, that is a custom helmet that is some what similar
        Still not a pulse blade pilot
Man, pulse blades suck apparently
That second pic is pilot Kane tossed after informing us of our lack of invitation to his party? I looked everywhere for that couldnâ€™t find it so
    No, the helmet design is different, also the pilot in the second photo can be found much earlier, in the mission "Blood and Rust" when you have to separate from BT, like, In the tubes that are near the ceiling, you will find him with 2 pyrostars stuck in his helmet
        Okay I guess that tossed pilot just despawnef after the cutscene then
where are the locations of every 1?
Looks something straight out of poppy playtimeÂ 
Meanwhile Anderson In the roof lol
The one pilot that actually knows where the enemy is, god damn kunai throwing noobs
man they really hate pulse pilots
Militia bozos
You missed one
Me sleeping after a night out:
Why are all of them the same blood type?
why almost everyone is pulse pilot
I appreciate you for including Anderson
[removed]
    Ik ðŸ˜­
Why do they look so comfy
Rest in peace.
Bro think he's Golden FreddyðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€
This is just the same dude napping in different places.
Where's Lastimosta?
You forgot lastimosa ;-;
Heh, with all those fancy gadgets, they still didnâ€™t see it coming
Pulse blade mains have it rough
Me and the boys at a sleepover (were all drunk and high) be like:
Same pattern with the destroyed Titans. The only model of a destroyed Titan we see in game is an Ion
Look Iâ€™m just gonna say it. The first image looks like a poorly drawn weasel thatâ€™s sad and disappointed
TEAM FORTESS TOO!!!!
Stims and Pulses get shat on for some reason in the campaign
    I shit on them in multiplayerâ€¦.grapple supremacy
         Tbh I've gotten more executions as pulse and Cloak than any other class, prefer them too asthetically
            Everyone has their play style. But the amount of cloak pilots that think I canâ€™t see themâ€¦ðŸ˜¬
                oh yeah its best used when everything is chaotic and people are less focused. rushing someone likely won't work unless they're really not paying attention, I've definitely killed quite a few cloaks, even meleed cloakers while we both were in cloak

Okay I guess that tossed pilot just despawnef after the cutscene then
 Tbh I've gotten more executions as pulse and Cloak than any other class, prefer them too asthetically
    Everyone has their play style. But the amount of cloak pilots that think I canâ€™t see themâ€¦ðŸ˜¬
        oh yeah its best used when everything is chaotic and people are less focused. rushing someone likely won't work unless they're really not paying attention, I've definitely killed quite a few cloaks, even meleed cloakers while we both were in cloak

Sniper+ cloaks+ low profile however are matches made in heaven
            I had a mate who accused people of hacking and tried to justify his kd of 0.04 as he was running up to people with cloak trying to execute

Then he'd insist he was better than me...

Dude didn't even know about low profile "No obvious effect = useless"
                That's hilarious and depressing.

How do you get executions btw? I tried it a few times and either do a simple melee or nothing happens, do I need to back-stab them?

And I never even thought about using cloak to get executions, I've always used the cloak + sachels technique to suicide-bomb random corridors (and then play mind-games when the enemy team catches on and starts taking alternate routes to sneak up on me). Or to simply make myself a harder target to hit in a 1v1 (though I find holo pilot does this best).
                    You go behind them then hold the melee button :)
                        Thanks!

Now I understand the usefulness of cloak pilot for this task
                LMFAO
Idr my k/d its low iirc, but I usually aim to get at least 5-10, my peak currently is 21 at most
        Played fire fight as cloak and someone said "You're different in the best kind of way"    

Unironically helped me get my execution goal of 50 in 3 days.
        you would be surprised the amount of pulse pilots who forget their pulse doesent last forever.  


then again, i play exclusively cloak because i love the giant bulky look on a guy going 40km/h. then again, i also love how the "gender" is more a question of "do you want a dust cover for your legs or not?"
        Damn man I think I have bad eyes or something when these moa fugga cloak I canâ€™t see em
    Well makes sense y u get more as cloak, sneaky bastard
        Ironically, pulse carries more than cloak, but cloak does allow me to traverse terrain without getting sniped
    As a g12.40 or so cloak main I can agree to this:)
bold words for someone who's about to have a knife trickshotted into their skull midswing
    False, I hovered mid swing and mag dumped that pretty helmet of yours. Did I mention Iâ€™m a car main ðŸ˜”
        Now youre a sitting duck for my laser core
            As a tone main, I hope you stub your toe
No we Cloak Sisters supremacy.

if you arent appearing, cant be seen which means you are just dark matter at this point with absolutely bo resistance to any force whatsoever, you would technically just see darkness as light wouldnt even catch up to you
    Im pretty sure you would see light incoming from ahead of you, but looking behind would be dark
        However with absolutely zero resistance to any force, you would literally escape light and not see anything, so technically i stand correct, or am i stupid?(not being rude but like just funny you know)
            Uhhh I dont blame you for thinking it lol the actual thing is really weird. 

So basically, you're seeing everything in the past by like fractions of a second. Light takes time to travel from the point where it bounces off the thing and then goes to you, but it travels that distance super fast. If someone were going faster than light, they would be invisible since the light can't keep up, but would be able to see you since the light is going towards them instead of trying to race them.

(I am not scientist tho so take with plentiful salt)
                SO PILOTS WITH CLOAK ARE JUST DARK MATTER THAT CAN CONTROL THIER SPEED
Phase and stim

You literally appear from thin air
Grapple kraber players are already challenging enough. Let's not give them wall hacks
Think I heard it mentioned by the guy who made the Bangalore vs pilot animation in the bts video

The one and only!

*S rank*
Probably, the shirt Iâ€™m wearing rn looks heavy but can easily be seen through, it just makes it darker
    Still I don't know
        Always fun to imagine and question
            True but still I don't know lol
