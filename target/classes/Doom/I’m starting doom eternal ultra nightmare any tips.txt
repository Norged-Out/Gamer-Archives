[[I’m starting doom eternal ultra nightmare any tips]]


I started to play doom eternal on ultra nightmare do you have any pointers on how to beat the game


Damn that screen is an ultra nightmare
    I spat out my soda while seeing this lmao
    I just beat the first level
        By the looks of your monitor, you used your bare hands
            You all have given me a good chortle.

What's the bet that OP cracks that screen more from these attempts?
                The fuck's a "chortle"? Sounds like some kind of pokemon?
                    a snort and a chuckle combination
                        Great answer o7
            Sam Hayden tried to give him a mission briefing.
        You got it bro I believe in you
        Cultist base is where it starts getting dicey, hope you’ve completed the campaign a few dozen times! A single unexpected enemy in an arena is likely to kill you
Don’t get killed
    Hit things until they die
        To defeat the Cyberdemon, shoot at it until it dies
            I laughed pretty hard the first time I saw that tip. Mainly cause I was drinking rather heavily and had just died to it a few times. Saw the tip and was just like..... thanks, ID,  I hadn't thought of just shooting it until it does 😆
You can do a regular nightmare campaign alongside it if you need to practice specific levels
    +1 to this tip. Practice the bosses and cultist base
        Cultist base is absolutely where runs end lol
    I beat nightmare
        I figured, but having to start the entire UN run because of a mistake or something you forgot really sucks.  It's just something to keep in mind basically.
            I accidentally did but I want to try it anyway
Try to memorize where high priority demons spawn so you can take care of them fast, get familiar with all movement options there are in each arena, and try to stay relaxed. Nerves were one of the biggest run killers for me. Having saving throw can help reduce this during fights you find difficult.
    Chrono Strike is a good substitute. I’ve found I get further with that than saving throw because it has more used in a given level.
Edit I am on the Nintendo switch
    Wizard. Are you playing on controller or the handheld? I’m so bad if I don’t have controller lol
        Handheld
            lmao good luck. I was gonna suggest mods to skip the intro cutscene because you will likely have to watch it A LOT and a good chunk of it is unskippable. There’s also a mod that removes the fortress of doom entirely so you can just go straight to the next level with any upgrades that you would get from the fortress given to you saving a lot of time.
        I am bad if I dont have a mouse, how the hell can you beat the game on a controller?
            I did it on ps4. Its like second nature dont even think about it.
    💀 ...
    Damn playing at 25fps it’s an ultra nightmare already
r/screenshotsarehard
    How do you take a screenshot on a hardware accelerated application? All you get is a black screen
        The switch has an instant screenshot button.
            You can tell is a switch from a picture of just the screen?
                First thing, yes, as a Day 1 Switch owner, I could. However OP also confirmed it in the comments.
                    Yes I saw that comment but I wanted to know if you said that before seeing that comment. Wouldnt be difficult to upload that screenshot to reddit? Does it take multiple steps?
                        It probably would take a few steps, and honestly I’ve never done it myself, they could have added a Reddit button by now, I believe they had a facebook, instagram, and a few others you could share to.
Have fun
    Will do
        The real answer is run as fast as possible using movement stuff and kill the demons as fast as possible equally. You are going to suffer anyway. Also try Titanfall 2, it's campaign and story along with it is FAN-FUCKING-TASTIC
    *weihnachten am klavier starts playing*
To beat the cyberdemon, shoot him till he die
Dodge, duck, dip, dive and dodge
I am doing UN runs too, here what I found useful.

1. Practise on nightmare save before doing it on UN.
2. Cultist base till you get the weapon mod is challenging, may require practice.
3. Learn PB+Rocket combo.
4. Keep yourself far away from demons & watch your ass, soldier boys are sneaky mf.
5. Chainsaw the hellknight on the last arena of exultia, one mancubus in the arena after you get rocket, one mancubus in the SSG pit.
6. Dump points in fast lock on. Get air control, equipment fiend.
7. Analyse lots of un runs by other.
wear a cup
Don’t die
Bc you are going to have to replay sections this will save you some time, if you pick up an item while you are switching weapons you will skip the pickup animation. It doesn’t work on everything but it’s nice not to have to watch the same pickup cutscenes over and over again.
    It works when you pick up the frags on hell on earth, ice bomb in the base and when you pick up sentinel power cores in Exultia.
Yes. Do not die
I recently started playing UN as well. I don't have any good tips. Best I managed to survive so far is whiplash introduction fight in level 3.

I play on nightmare alongside ultra nightmare and I keep a list of everything I do, like what upgrades I choose first and when and how did I die. In later levels I'm planning to map out my bfg and crucible usage since I usually don't use them.

I'm nkt sure if it's worth doing slayer gates. I usually do them, but on UN they feel too risky. My plan so far is to only do exultia slayer gate.

Good luck!
Buena suerte papu

Biggest chokepoints for me was the Cultist Base, Super Gore Nest, Sentinel Prime and Nekravol, make a second savefile where you play on Nightmare and train those arenas to not get surprised... I mostly used Adrenalin, Faster Recharge and mostly Air Control. When things gets tough I replace adrenalin with Final Blow, so just in case you have one more try. Good luck Great Slayer :)
Shoot weak points, get the air control rune as soon as you can, get the blood fueled rune next, get the flaming meathook ASAP, Quick Swap, use the faulted system, know the max armor pickup locations (typically they’re where a 1-up would be on other difficulties), use the BFG and crucible blade wisely.
    Thank you
You should start up 3 new saves. One on nightmare to practice not dying in the level, and 2 on Ultra-Nightmare in case you die in one of your Ultra-Nightmare saves.

Then you just do each step and level one at a time.  (Like you complete Hell on Earth on all 3 saves before moving onto the next, for example.)

That’s what helped me beat UN twice. Good luck on yours!
In my experience you should definitely practice the levels on an alternate Nightmare run beforehand, some levels i recommend practicing with are:

• Cultist Base

• Gladiator

• Nekravol: Part II

• Urdak

• Final Sin ( In the second phase of the Icon Of Sin the demons it spawns are not always the same so your Nightmare run may be different to your UN run )

There will most likely be a level you struggle the most with, for me it was Cultist Base and Gladiator since one was a boss fight and Cultist Base is a sudden difficulty spike when you don't have many upgrades yet.

Try doing all challenges as possible until you get all upgrades and getting all sentinel batteries, as well as sentinel coins, upgrades will make a big difference late game.

There are weapon mods that i recommend for an UN run:

• Rocket Launcher - Lock On Burst: Absolutely devastating damage and will deal with dread knights, whiplashes, pain elementals and other heavy demons effectively.

• Chaingun - Energy Shield: An absolute beast for dealing with tyrants and barons, try mixing it up with blood punch and grenades to stack up damage, as well as faltering demons with the dash. It will come in handy in the gladiator fight to tank some of the damage in the more difficult to dodge attacks.

• Plasma Rifle - Microwave Beam: An absolute godsend early game, it will melt the shield out of a Doom Hunter in seconds and will stun every demon in the game for a brief while, try getting the range and lock on speed upgrade before the first doom hunter fight and pair with the lock on burst to melt the health out of the doom hunter.

And of course, have fun :)
Plan your upgrades and what optional fights are worth going for 
Super weapon ammo management (plan your bfg and crucible use rather than using it as a panic button)
Practice bad situations in arenas eg on a nightmare save let an archvile get summons before fighting it and fight it without ice bomb to sometimes trying a back up plan
Master quick switching, and in particular, learn what weapon combos you can use to kill demons as quickly as possible. Its been a while since i got UN , but for example, learn that a mancubus dies to ss + balista + rocket , or ss + pb + ss + pb
Focus yourself on higher damage and support demons so tyrant doom hunters marauders and the wall building dudes should be focused since most will kill you easily and the wall guy often blocks you from glory kills and other items you need
When you get the chaingun in the Super Gore Nest make sure tho apply the Shield mod. It’s a life savior everywhere and a great weapon itself when upgraded to the max. Won’t do you well against the gladiator though so use your most destructive ones against him.
I beat every level in ultra night mare but i have no Tips im useless
Rip and tear, until it is done.
One important tip

Steam uses the F12 key to take screenshots

You can then find them in the Steam folder

If you can't find it, maybe try pressing [Alt] + [R] and typing "Steam" in, I hope it works
For UN I would have my UN run going and a regular nightmare run going at the same time. And once I could reliably beat each level without dying 2 or 3 times in a row I would switch it to my UN file
Your going to Die. A lot
What I did is just do it, and restart as many times as you need. It’s one life but infinite tries. Just go for it. Fix mistakes along the way.
SURVIVE!!!!
Get a new screen protector? (I've never played ultra nightmare)
Keep moving and get seek and destroy as your first rune
Rip and tear
Don't get invested
I don’t know how to give you tips for each level since it just comes down to memorizing how you can deal with certain encounters, and how you can deal with situations you weren’t prepared for. But an important thing to remember is that if you die, do not get discouraged. Keep trying until you can get it, and also don’t let ultra nightmare consume you. Take a break from it if you need it (I know I sure did)
I got halfway and can firmly say practice the shit out of the levels. You can always quit after each missions, can go back to beat secret encounters, and switching abilities is always better. Id still recommend playing the whole campaign and finding the cheeses(like shotty+plasma on maurader)(I think that’s what they’re called)
I think people in the comments forgot that ultra nightmare is permadeath
Git gud
    I will
    I beat the Kaiser campaign on my pc
    Scrolled too far to find this
LOL bro you playing this game ?? 😂😂 Just kill demons and have fun
Don’t
    I beat the Kaiser canpaign on my pc at home
        Wdym Kaiser?
            Like the mod from Kaiser will
                YOU CAN MOD ETERNAL?
                    Yes you can
                        Damn so what does this Kaiser change?
                            It makes all of the levels like master levels
                                Oh, I haven’t beaten one master level. Nor the campaign on nightmare. I’ve tried un for the gold combat shotgun skin but. p a i n
                                    I got the shotgun skin
                                    Lol
                                So uh  a good luck is the best I can do for ya
                                    Thx
                            rebalances the entire campaign to be harder. that means different weapon and pickup placements, rebalance of specific demons in some cases (for example a lower health marauder in early levels), entirely new demons (or at least reskins that appear separately and have different mechanics, even with their own codex entry), reworked bossfights and some other stuff I can't think of because it's been a few months since I tried it
                                Seems like fun
                                    It is, it’s very hard. Modding doom eternal is like, 90% of the fun
Use the perk that slows down time when you are dealt a killing blow. Every time it gets triggered just force restart the game and you will begin at last checkpoint. I beat UN in a few days doing this
    You didn't truly beat the game on UN then.
        [deleted]
            Your steam account can't tell if you cheated
                I’m willing to bet a ton of people beat ultranightmare doing this, or worse since you can mod the game to make weapons do a billion damage per shot automatic fire faster fire rate than plasma rifle etc.  hell you can probably just use god mode, though to be fair I’ve not used either of these so I don’t actually know if you can get UN completion credit with them, I just assume you can because I’ve not seen anything stating the contrary.
                    The most I’ve done is recently discovered some genius made the ballista skin into the raygun from call of duty zombies, and someone else made a visuals/sound effect with optional damage change to be ray gun accurate, and wow, way too strong. Played with it for like an hour in the dlcs just melting everything in 2 hits and then removed the dmg change, it was fun but clearly too good, the most fun though was ballista boosting since it rapid fired at 180 rpm, you would go so fast and could get lift from it like a little jet engine.
Don't play on switch
Try not to save too often.
Shooting demons does a lot more damage than not missing them
Are you playing on a tablet?
    No a Nintendo Switch
        tip that I have connect a keyboard and mouse to Nintendo switch and practice on nightmare a lot especially on cultist base and all slayer gates, ur gonna need to get used to use frag grenade, ice bombs and flame belch a lot. good luck
Fire is your friend.

Burning enemies give you armor
I gotta tip... DON'T DIE
Replace that screen protector..
Shoot the demons until they die.
Don’t die, kill demons, clean monitor.
No.
Don't buy a new screen until you completely smash this one out of frustration
Don’t die
Just don’t die
Play like you do kaiser but on switch. Ez obviously? Duh
Don't die
Kill things until they all die
Here's a tip you can relay on..


DON'T!
Be patient.
Set up hotkeys for quick switch weapons
Survive.
To defeat the enemies, shoot them until they die
Step one: play the game
Step two: perhaps go to a therapist for anger management issues
to kill a tyrant, shoot it till it's dead
Stay hydrated
Play ultrakill first doom will feel like a damn snail
Dont die
Part 1, get an anger management instructor, that screen did nothing wrong.

2. Try and beat the game first on hurt me pretty or violent, when playing UN and your low health dont stress yourself trying to desperately get health from an enemy or such, doom eternal is all about room controll so dont feel bad running around and memorizing amo/medkits placements. Allways try to kill the biggest problem first before anything else and be sure you know your arsenal, its all just trial and error.
    I would go a bit further and say beat it a few times on nightmare at least, avoid the lower difficulties you will get lulled into a false sense of security since you barely take any dmg from getting hit on other difficulties, you gotta be familiar with enemy aggression and their dmg, since 2 hits and you’re probably dead if you’re hit by a heavy/super heavy.
Holy shit. Learn to take a screenshot plz

Biggest UN choke points (imo): Cultist Base Mancubus pit, Super Gore Nest totem room and Gladiator. Otherwise just don't die.
Memorize enemy spawns and practice on nightmare specific areas
Try tu put yourself under circumstances like low ammo where you need you find resources on the arena or just running until you can reload your chainsaw
Always, ALWAYS, eliminate enemy weapons (arachnatrons, mancubus, revenants) you can make it much easier that way
Do at least 2 runs through the whole game on Extra life mode. Once you can get through SGN with no lives used, it’s downhill from there.

If you haven’t done Extra Lives mode yet, give that a try. I barely scraped by with ZERO lives left at the Icon Of Sin.

Got me that Phobos skin though. Ultra sick.
You should watch videos on YouTube to see how you could train, I advise you to watch CYNS-production, the dude made general tips and tips for all the levels in UN
Don’t die
Dont die
I can’t speak for Eternal but I’ve played a bit of 2016 on UN. So not sure if this advice carries over but:

- Take out imps fast. They hit hard on UN and a group of them will ruin your day

- It may sound obvious, but don’t get hit. I found you need to really focus on positioning and timing since health pickups give minimal health increases. Better not to lose heath in the first place

- on a similar note, time your glory kills. Since you don’t get as much health from them if you get hit mid glory kill the health gained won’t make a difference.
Nope I haven’t started mine yet as I’m playing DooM 2016 on Ultra violence
Tip: just go ahead and throw your controller against the wall
You’re gonna die a fuck ton of times before beating the game. Also, Archviles can spawn three marauders now
I have no tips but I wish you the very best of luck, god speed my friend!
Always be moving
Don't die👍

But in all seriousness, at least for the first 3 levels, memorize the chainsaw pickups and save them for heavy demons. 

If you normally use pb for the heavy cannon, use micro missiles for the first 2 levels and the first half of the third until you get the SSG and rocket launcher because pb is only good when paired with other weapons so it's not that good in early game when you have a limited arsenal, and they are really good for dealing with heavys early game. If you initially skip the second modbot on hell on earth, you can fast travel back to it and get pb for the heavy cannon.

Ignore slayer gates and secret encounters you deem too risky.

Obviously collect your 3 runes and every praetor suit token, sentinel battery and sentinel crystals and (try to) do every mission challenge. It's up to you how you spend your upgrades but I recommend saving your weapon upgrade points so you have 9 by the time you get the SSG so you can immediately start doing the mastery for it because flaming hook is the best. For the praetor suit upgrades, I highly recommend upgrading: hot swapper > grappler > faster dasher, then using them how you please. I would upgrade frags and ice bomb back and forth until they are both maxed, the rest aren't that important.

After finishing DOOM Hunter Base, get the 2 sentinel crystals from your base.

Don't be stubborn like me and use the BFG and crucible and use the saving throw rune. If it Activates, switch to another rune and equip it back in the next level.
Don’t die (hope this helps)
As a fellow Switch player, I respect you, brave warrior!
I wish you well on your cruel journey!

PS Do you know the effective way to handle The First Marauder or Marauders in general? These MFs are pissing me off so hard... XD
Don't die.
Step 1: Rip

Step 2: Tear

Step 3: Repeat, until it is done
Get a new monitor
Don’t die
Get a new monitor asap😭
Imps will wreck your shit at that difficulty, lol
TURN BACK
Don't die.
Don't die
Get a new screen
Get a un-fucked up monitor
Only play a level if you've completed it 10 times over in Nightmare beforehand (without dying).
wont lie i beat it but i have seen many people use a glitch to beat. close out your application after having the perk to give you a final chance to live.
Weep
Don't die

Shoot at demons until they die

To kill the tyrant, shoot at it until it dies, just like every other demon
Tears ahead
Good luck and rip and tear em slayer
don't die
Here’s a tip: fix your screen :)))
bro what happened to your screen?
Here's a tip: take a screenshot on the device you're playing on instead of with your phone LMAO
Don't stop moving always keep an eye on your ammos and go for week points simple tips and would not recommend on Nintendo switch unless you want to play ultra ultra nightmare trust me I have a switch too and even thinking about playing Doom on it sounds horrible
Don't
Refuse death
Breath)
Become the slayer
Sure. Try to rip and tear until it is done
Good luck
Don't die
Rip and tear of course!
Suffering
One thing I’ve been doing is extra life mode runs, and seeing how long it takes until I can get a full completion with only losing 1-2 lives. So far I’ve made it to sentinel prime twice with only one death but then both times I went over deaths to gladiator and deleted save and restarted. I will be practicing gladiator exclusively until I can beat him consistently without dying, then will start another extra life mode run.

It’s funny I feel like I could almost do TAG2 ultrawide nightmare, not tag1 quite yet, but the most difficult part of the campaign UN is the lack of your full kit, in the dlcs I have no problem areas, and it feels easier because there’s nothing limiting my combat, the difficulty really comes from being base stats, and missing weapons/mods/upgrades.
Get a new TV for one
I spat out my soda while seeing this lmao
I just beat the first level
    By the looks of your monitor, you used your bare hands
        You all have given me a good chortle.

By the looks of your monitor, you used your bare hands
    You all have given me a good chortle.

What's the bet that OP cracks that screen more from these attempts?
        The fuck's a "chortle"? Sounds like some kind of pokemon?
            a snort and a chuckle combination

    Sam Hayden tried to give him a mission briefing.
You got it bro I believe in you
Cultist base is where it starts getting dicey, hope you’ve completed the campaign a few dozen times! A single unexpected enemy in an arena is likely to kill you
To defeat the Cyberdemon, shoot at it until it dies
    I laughed pretty hard the first time I saw that tip. Mainly cause I was drinking rather heavily and had just died to it a few times. Saw the tip and was just like..... thanks, ID,  I hadn't thought of just shooting it until it does 😆
Cultist base is absolutely where runs end lol
I figured, but having to start the entire UN run because of a mistake or something you forgot really sucks.  It's just something to keep in mind basically.
    I accidentally did but I want to try it anyway
Handheld
    lmao good luck. I was gonna suggest mods to skip the intro cutscene because you will likely have to watch it A LOT and a good chunk of it is unskippable. There’s also a mod that removes the fortress of doom entirely so you can just go straight to the next level with any upgrades that you would get from the fortress given to you saving a lot of time.
I am bad if I dont have a mouse, how the hell can you beat the game on a controller?
    I did it on ps4. Its like second nature dont even think about it.
The switch has an instant screenshot button.
    You can tell is a switch from a picture of just the screen?
        First thing, yes, as a Day 1 Switch owner, I could. However OP also confirmed it in the comments.
            Yes I saw that comment but I wanted to know if you said that before seeing that comment. Wouldnt be difficult to upload that screenshot to reddit? Does it take multiple steps?
                It probably would take a few steps, and honestly I’ve never done it myself, they could have added a Reddit button by now, I believe they had a facebook, instagram, and a few others you could share to.
The real answer is run as fast as possible using movement stuff and kill the demons as fast as possible equally. You are going to suffer anyway. Also try Titanfall 2, it's campaign and story along with it is FAN-FUCKING-TASTIC
Wdym Kaiser?
    Like the mod from Kaiser will
        YOU CAN MOD ETERNAL?
            Yes you can
                Damn so what does this Kaiser change?
                    It makes all of the levels like master levels
                        Oh, I haven’t beaten one master level. Nor the campaign on nightmare. I’ve tried un for the gold combat shotgun skin but. p a i n
                            I got the shotgun skin
                            Lol
                        So uh  a good luck is the best I can do for ya
                            Thx
                    rebalances the entire campaign to be harder. that means different weapon and pickup placements, rebalance of specific demons in some cases (for example a lower health marauder in early levels), entirely new demons (or at least reskins that appear separately and have different mechanics, even with their own codex entry), reworked bossfights and some other stuff I can't think of because it's been a few months since I tried it
                        Seems like fun
                            It is, it’s very hard. Modding doom eternal is like, 90% of the fun

    Your steam account can't tell if you cheated
        I’m willing to bet a ton of people beat ultranightmare doing this, or worse since you can mod the game to make weapons do a billion damage per shot automatic fire faster fire rate than plasma rifle etc.  hell you can probably just use god mode, though to be fair I’ve not used either of these so I don’t actually know if you can get UN completion credit with them, I just assume you can because I’ve not seen anything stating the contrary.
            The most I’ve done is recently discovered some genius made the ballista skin into the raygun from call of duty zombies, and someone else made a visuals/sound effect with optional damage change to be ray gun accurate, and wow, way too strong. Played with it for like an hour in the dlcs just melting everything in 2 hits and then removed the dmg change, it was fun but clearly too good, the most fun though was ballista boosting since it rapid fired at 180 rpm, you would go so fast and could get lift from it like a little jet engine.
tip that I have connect a keyboard and mouse to Nintendo switch and practice on nightmare a lot especially on cultist base and all slayer gates, ur gonna need to get used to use frag grenade, ice bombs and flame belch a lot. good luck
