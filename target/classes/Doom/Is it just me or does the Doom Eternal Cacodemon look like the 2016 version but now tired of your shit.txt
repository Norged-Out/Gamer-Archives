    Now I want to see a mashup of Monsters Inc and Doom. Mike Wazowski as a Cacodemon and Sully as a Baron of Hell.
        Eeesh, but that thing back where it came from so help me....
            Or I’ll poke myself in the E Y E!
        wait wasnt there a post in this sub about EXACTLY that already
            Yeah I remember it too

        i save that for the Pain Elemental since he is like a cooked Meatball. I guess you can say raw meatboi lol.
            Meatboi al dente.
                Sounds better honestly I concede.
            The pain elemental is a potat
These guys who belong to the most powerful and dangerous realm in existence with numberless hordes of their kind (even fucking Titans) to back them up have been getting their shit handed by a sole single crazy psychopath with anger management issues for millennia.
Of course the poor Cacodemon is tired of this shit.
    \*Sees that the Glory Kill is coming\*

Oh dear. I wonder what he-

\*Rips the eye out\*

OF FUCKING COURSE.
        *You've ripped out my eyes long enough doom slayer*
            *eye
                If you think about it too much then you start to wonder if the caco is the same entity as the one you keep killing.
                    I think you deal with multiple cacodemons at some point in doom.
                        Who says time fuckery isn't afoot?
                            Perhaps, I've wondered if demons breed or if they are just cloned somehow
                                Isn't there a map called Spawning Vats?
                                    If there is I didn't know about it
                    Is the Cacodemon's name Agrajag by any chance?

                I know this is three years old but BOOOOO
        Now I really want a mode where all of the demons talk and none of them want to be there.
            Imp: NO PLEASE DEAR NAMELESS ONE I'M JUST AN I.T.-
            Demon: "GOSH Doom Slayer, you think you're gonna rip and tear today or maybe tear and rip?"

Doomguy: "***RIP AND TEEEEEEEEAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRR"***

Demon: "Okay, good to know."
        How to stop doomslayer 101:

Doomslayer! You racist for attacking our defining identity! Why can’t you rip out my guts like the other demons?! But no, you have to go for the eye, racist
            Doom Slayer: *Proceeds to rip out both caco's guts and the eye.*
                Ah, equality achieved
            Doomslayer: ".... I'm sorry I don't remember asking to give a fuck."

Cacodemon: "It was worth a try."
        With the funny popping sounds lol.
            Well naturally.
        At this point I'm like "Just leave his goddamn eye ALONE, man. Do something else to him for a change. Tear his jaws apart. Rip his heart out. Make him listen to Billie Eilish on repeat for all I care.

Just please...for the love of all that is good and holy...*leave his eye alone."*
            S-stop he’s already dead!
                There's no dead demon like a gibbed demon.
            Doomslayer: "But..... the POPPING sounds."
    They've always been bitches, though.
    I don't know why but i read "millennia" with khan makyr's voice... I shouldn't have watched the trailer 50 times in a row

For the demons
he brushed his teeth too. good job Caco
    Hell has suprisingly good dental care
        too bad they are all demons :/
            ~~Hell~~ knight and co. Dental care
                ah. yes
It has an iris and Cleaner teeth.
    and an upper eyelid
        Other than that, it’s the exact same character model as 2016, right down to the wrinkles.

Only real thing that has been updated are the model textures.
            didn't you notice that its' flesh...skin?... wobbles and pulses now?
            [deleted]
                No they aren’t. Its mouth is just slightly open on the newest game.
                    look closer. the side teeth are easily different but even the regular teeth are a little shorter and theres more of them.
    He finally started taking care of his teeth
I didn't even realize these fuckers have arms. You don't really notice some things when you're too busy ripping out they're oversized eyeballs from their sockets.
    It's actually really great, if you hit them with a well-placed rocket their limbs all go flying off at once
        If I'm not too zoned in rippin' and tearin' later I will try to keep an eye out for this.
            Rip and tear until it is done, friend
                I shall be worse. It will be done.
    That's why I love the fucking art book, cuz you can see them up close and appreciate the art department for a job well done!
“You have displeased the meatball”
"I'm so fucking tired of hearing about Coronavirus"

Bro... stop killing my friends
    Rip'd n' torn
Probably hit it's teenage years. Fucking puberty.
    yea slayer coming. like, whatever man, there are bigger problems out there.
“Ah shit, here we go again”
i want a skin for them that just turns them into meatballs.
    The meatball man
It looks awesome either way, but I do like the mono-colored eyeball better. It looks more sinister. The iris provides too much expression and relatability. With one tone, it just looks demonic, deranged, and otherworldly.
    I def really liked the dead eyes of the 2016 designs. I feel like a lot of the Eternal redesigns are a mixed bag, I don't like the new revenants or mancubus as much
        Agree on the mixed bag. Ultimately, I still think it all looks cool, and anything I have is just nitpicky and isn't actually ruining anything for me.  
It's like the game is at 99.9% badassitude and I'm like, yeah, but THIS is what would give you that last meaningless .1%  
If the biggest complaint I have about your game is that the monsters have irises, you're doing everything else right. lol
            For sure, I'm soooo hyped for this game
            Hell Knight from 2016 with no eyes is way better.
        I have little problem with the redesigns aside from the cacodemons iris and the mancubus. I LOVED the 2016 mancubus design. The dead single eye, mandibles, and armor meshed into its body were cool as fuck. The new ones look too goofy and weird for my tastes.
            yeah i wish they stuck with the tone of 2016 but i’m buying it either way
            My favourite enemy design in 2016 is the revanent and im really not sure why I like the Eternal version less. I def miss some stuff about the old aesthetic, but it's not at all diminishing my hype for Eternal
                I wish we still had the 2016 Cyberdemon, or at least have it as a variation. Even though it didn’t look like the original at all the Balgaar demon had such a cool design it’s a shame it’s gone now.
                    Ive seen the new Cyberdemon in the trailer but I don't know much about its role in the new game. Perhaps the new Cyberdemon is a big enemy like it is in Doom 2? Rare, extremely powerful, but not a boss like the Doom 1 or 2016 versions
                        It’s a sub-boss I know that much. I just wish we still had the Balgaar demon in some way, as it had one of my favourite designs in 2016. It would be cool though if it came back even more cyberised in Doom Eternal.
            I never liked the 2016 mancubus, they just looked.... What's the word, lost. I felt sorry every time I killed them because of the pure confusion on their face, now in eternal they look pissed off
        I def like the darker look. The gameplay looks cool, but the cartoonish aspect is a bummer
            Is it a deal breaker tho? And are people really forgetting about the fact that the og cacos had irises? They’re harking back to the old design by giving the thing a proper eyeball now.
                Its not a dealbreaker, but a bummer
                    I don’t get why though but I’ve never been one to care about the change in art style of a game.
                        I like the more sinister look. The monsters look extremely pissed off this time, when in doom 2016 there were all kinda dead eyed. Now it's like theres history between us and it comes across in their hateful faces.
                            Agreed and I realized I forgot to add a word in my last comment, I’m never the kind of person to give a shit about a change in art style in a game.
            Agreed.  They leaned too heavily into that "Saturday morning cartoon" idea.
                Is it a deal breaker though?
                    Hell no.  Gameplay looks incredible.
            Remember he did partially look cartoony in the 32 bit era
                Im not a purist, i just like the darker tone
                    Ok
                    I've asked if we can get a third cacodemon
            They seem to be leaning into the Saturday morning cartoon but ultraviolent tone for Eternal. They know how absurd and kind of goofy it is and they aren’t trying to maximize grimdark edginess at the expense of fun. One of the influences for the original Doom was the Evil Dead movies, which combine absurd levels of gore and dismemberment with slapstick and dark humor. Doesn’t matter if you are scared, grossed out, laughing, or some combination as long as it gets a reaction out of you and keeps you entertained.
        Personally I think the new Baron is pretty fucking great, it’s super different from the last one though
        I really don't like the new arcvhile look. I am so excited for Doom eternal however I feel like a lot of the demons took on a more alien look and less demonic. The old archviles were creepy, pale, and them dying had their limbs snapping and sounding demonic as hell. The new one just looks like a generic alien who's been lifting weights his entire life.
            I personally like the new one more. One thing for me is that the old archvile looked a lot squishier than it is
                I'm glad the new ones have fans. Maybe I'm just a grumpy old man. I also miss the noises the old ones made. The cacodemon hissing, the mancubuses fatty gargling noises, and so on. I feel like they all kind of sound the sameish with low bass tones. Regardless this is me being picky because doom 2016 was fucking awesome and im stupid excited for eternal.
“Damn Slayer always running around murdering my friends smh ...”
I kind of prefer no pupil. It makes it look more inhuman and menacing.
One grenade in the mouth kills me?  Really?  Fuck.
    > One grenade in the mouth kills me? Really?

*GULP*
I never noticed they had a seam running down the bottom of them like a nutsack
    you have good eyesight fapper\_keeper, it definitely looks even more so with the old colour scheme
        I'm very familiar with balls, I've had a pair my whole life!
"This asshole again"
2016 caco was just hungry, now he's pissed
    Reminds me of someone
His mouth also kinda looks like the Classic Cacodemon's mouth but reversed
DoomGuy: "your free trial of eye has expired Mike Wazowski"
I love how they uodated all the designs. The new one looks less shiny and more like he has actual skin. That softness. He's way more expressive, and there's more of a sense of shape and direction, with the two rows of teeth on the sides of his mouth now being straighter and placed more at an angle like that.
It also has bigger balls
the cacodemon better have a visible asshole like it did in the og games
He looks more alive, the 2016 one seems like a beast that is motivated by hunger (like in the description of it) The eternal one, looks like all the other demons, sentient and **very grumpy.**
I love them both. Hey 32 2016 can we add a third to the family? Well looks like we're getting a third cacodemon around the apartment.
I like both designs honestly
He got better dental insurance
I really like the pupil addition to it make it convey more emotions, like pain
I'm just happy he has a pupil now! He can actually see, though he obviously has to squint to see you.
*i’m* tired of my shit
    take it out on them, fam
Looks more like the Doom 1993 version...
    It looks like that was their goal for most of the redesigns.
Nah he baked as shit this dude ate like 4 edibles
I love the Cacodemon
Old one looks better ngl
    Yeah, Way better. Really befuddled by some of the changes. Mancubus too.
The new ones have pupils 0.0
Stupid sexy meatball
    I can assist you with that
That model looks fucking amazing though
    I love it yeah. I'm so happy that doom 2016 included a model viewer
They gave them pupils just to drive home the fact that caco angery
10 more dayssssss!!!! cant wait!!
[deleted]
    Him AND his little friends!
Judgemental Caco
I just see a picture of gibs in both.
“Listen here pal, I’ve heard and seen what you’ve done to my friends, again, and again, and again, motherfucker.

But now it is MY time to RISE TO THE OCCASION, to RIP AND EAT YOU A NEW ONE MOTHERFUCKER. Me and my species of demons are TIRED of you for getting in our way of total DEMONIC INVASION MOTHERFUCKER, SO I AM HERE TO-“

*gets grenaded in the mouth*

“Did you jus-“

*Gets glory killed*
Well if you think about it the cacodemon has had to go throw years of doom that’s mean it’s been killed so many times that it is so tired and depressed to the point he/she can’t even help to live it’s life anymore and when they have to invade earth or mars again then it’s like a shit here we go again and after a while it gets annoying and pissy they don’t want to deal with all that shit all over again. In conclusion yes the it’s a more tired, Depressed and pissy Caco
I think it's just him reacting to the metal hook flying directly towards his face.
I just realized it has little fucked up hands
Mans just wanna go home and see his family invading earth no easy feat
I think it’s because he has a pupil and his “face” area is more detailed.
COFFEE FIRST! THEN DYING!
    Everyday mood
That is the face of someone resigned to his fate
That is my mom's expression when I eat cereal with water
They're alot more expressive this time around
Well im tired of his shit
I know I'm in the minority here and this is an extremely minor nitpick because the game looks awesome af, but I am not a fan of DOOM Eternal's art style. It's not really bad, and I love the older games to death, but I was really digging the more grounded style of DOOM 2016.
    Same, it's not just that it looks *different*, it just looks... not as good.
        Yeah, there's a massive disconnect now between DOOM 2016 and its sequel in terms of aesthetic.
I wonder if he talks like Meatwad from Aqua Team Hunger Force
    I get it. It ain't making me laugh, but I get it.
        Cool.
He looks the same to me with minor changes like the pupil and the white teeth/horns
    It's definitely very minor changes, it has eyelids now and got recoloured to match the Doom 1 & 2 colour scheme a bit better. Also it seems to be slightly rounder? Overall I really like how it looks. I just love that its expression is "here we go again"
I never realized it had arms, I always thought it was a giant meatball I eat with guns
Ya seems about right.
The meatball got sick of it's friends getting killed for dinner.
But This time it has a pupil!
You’d be tired too if your blood changed from blue to red and then back to blue again over the last two decades.
It looks like the 2p16 version has moe detail or is "scarier" but that's probably just a highly detailed concept art.
I need a pain elemental done in this style
    How do you mean by "this style", like in the Doom 2016 style?
        Either one tbh but I'd love to see the hyperdetailed Eternal version
Tired of the ass whooping
What do you know... El Caco cleaned his teeth and got contacts. Trying to look good before certain death.
just noticed that they both have a ballsack on their chins
When you used to be a threat but now you're all washed up and die instantly to a goof grenade kill.
Well he has SEEN some shit.
At least he can see. 2016 doesnt have a retna at all how does it see anything
    Senses the Argent energy
        Really? That sounds kinda cool
            That would be my best bet, I would think that's what attracts demons to "teleport" to you and appear out of thin air, perhaps they are pulled there, it may even be outside their control.

They don't kinda turn slowly and "lumber" towards you. Like they see your aura or something but not normal sight.
"You disgust me"
It's slowly blobbing back out into the original classic version, I hope.
If you shot it in the eye with the precision shot it fires its energy balls in random directions killing any demons it hits you can do it in DOOM 2016
(hits blunt)

(right image)
I didn't even notice a difference until now
Yeah but also he looks annoyed like “ahh shit here we go again”
It looks more intelligent, and also bears a closer resemblance to the original design. Both things are due to the addition of a pupil, as well as a more apparent facial expression.
    The colours are very definitely changed to be closer to the original as well, and it also got eyelids to be able to give it that hostile expression instead of a blank one
I dislike that the scrotum seam on the new one is less prominent.
he has a pupil
Well , now "eye" know why there isn't a monster inc.3 .
Oh he angy now
His chin almost looks like a scrotum.
That's what he is... Tired of your shit
First picture:  "Here, enjoy a free sample!"

2nd picture, after my 3rd or 4th sample:  "Alright now buddy.  You like it that much, buy the fuckin thing."
Looks like Garfield in his final form.
    I'm sorry Jon
Yep
the old one looks scarier and the new one in super expressive
He also got his cataracts cleared up! Good for him!
Yeah it really does
I like the new design because it looks kinda cartoony but realistic at the same time
He’s tired of getting his shit kicked in every time he hears death metal
It looks less tired and more like that specific feeling when you are so disgusted by something you can't even properly react to it. Like it just saw your browser history or something.
Yes.
God, it looks so contemptuous and *disgusted* in the second frame.

I love it.
Holy shit
Wouldn't you be at this point? Countless members of your race have been mowed down thoughtlessly by this man, maybe even some friends, and then you see him, and you think maybe you can get away, but he sees you... And for some fucking reason he's stolen some gadgets from Predator, and you just accept your fate...
He also brushed his teeth
I'm really, REALLY looking forward to stealing that eye.
I like the newer version. It looks less creepy
I'm hyped for Eternal but I feel like they gave the demons a more cartoony look to them. For example, the Hell Knights now have eyes taking away from their creepiness and the Cacodemon now has a pupil instead of a cloudy eye.

Not saying it's a negative, I'm going to enjoy this game nonetheless just wish they kept the vibe of the first game for the demons.
He brushed his teeth :)
I totally see that
We kicked its daddys ass, we can kick theirs too!
has a biden look about him
The pupil makes it look more sentient, too
You're not wrong
Oh jeezus! I am only just now realizing those are little vestigial limbs that hang down.
His teeth are clean. Good for him.
Is it just me or Caco's mono-ball getting smaller??
I think in general they tried to make the monsters a lot more expressive and stuff? I remember watching a few interviews that sort of explain it and all
It's tankier. Red orb boye come to play.
I've always like [the baked looking one](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/978/718/271.jpg) from 2016's promotional images
He brushed his teeth and got a pupil
He has gained a pupil, like the Cacodemon in the original games.
“Oh no! Not again!” 
And then the Cacodemon makes a call upon seeing its natural predator, upon hearing this call all demons get alerted for their untimely deaths.
I LOVE IT
“God damn it, jerry he’s here again go grab the imps and maybe a hell knight I don’t want to deal with this”
You can only get your one good eye ripped out so many times.
*flying egg*
[removed]
    That's just where it keeps its spare eye
He brushed his teef c:
Ew, just realized the cacodemon has a ballsack
Cacodemon is tired of having to try and blast you from afar with some purple projectile then come in close and swipe you with its flimsy hands. Seeing its comrades get blasted, sawed, and impaled to bits, it's seen enough of its demonic life to know how this is going to end and just wants to get things over with. #gotmyeyeonyou
The first boll is on drugs. The second is not.
He's tired of trying to show you how to scratch it
The thing on the right looks like some shit out of carton network. Fake deamon. fake news.
The new eye,. fuck that shit, looks like shit.
    Deus vult
        wonder how much estrogen it takes to give you a downvote. :o
            Lmao
    So you hate an entire model because of one line of black pixels? Talk about overreacting
        8==D <---
    Yeah, it does. Hopefully the game play will make up for the shitty redesigns. I'm starting to get a bad feeling though, especially with the "corridor" movement from 2016 being mentioned as a negative.
I don't know if it's the lighting, but the 2016 version looks more detailed.
    I'm pretty sure most of the model is the same, but they changed some details and the colors to make it more like the Doom 1&2 design. A lot of the enemies for redesigned to look like their old versions. Cyberdemon, mancubus, human soldiers, revenant
same
no but it looks like a hellish mike wazowski
Tomato meatball boi
He looks pissed off  .l-_-l.

    At this point I'm like "Just leave his goddamn eye ALONE, man. Do something else to him for a change. Tear his jaws apart. Rip his heart out. Make him listen to Billie Eilish on repeat for all I care.

Just please...for the love of all that is good and holy...*leave his eye alone."*
        S-stop he’s already dead!
            There's no dead demon like a gibbed demon.
        Doomslayer: "But..... the POPPING sounds."
They've always been bitches, though.

    Other than that, it’s the exact same character model as 2016, right down to the wrinkles.

Only real thing that has been updated are the model textures.
        didn't you notice that its' flesh...skin?... wobbles and pulses now?

            No they aren’t. Its mouth is just slightly open on the newest game.
                look closer. the side teeth are easily different but even the regular teeth are a little shorter and theres more of them.
He finally started taking care of his teeth
It's actually really great, if you hit them with a well-placed rocket their limbs all go flying off at once
    If I'm not too zoned in rippin' and tearin' later I will try to keep an eye out for this.
        Rip and tear until it is done, friend
            I shall be worse. It will be done.
That's why I love the fucking art book, cuz you can see them up close and appreciate the art department for a job well done!

yea slayer coming. like, whatever man, there are bigger problems out there.
The meatball man
I def really liked the dead eyes of the 2016 designs. I feel like a lot of the Eternal redesigns are a mixed bag, I don't like the new revenants or mancubus as much
    Agree on the mixed bag. Ultimately, I still think it all looks cool, and anything I have is just nitpicky and isn't actually ruining anything for me.  
It's like the game is at 99.9% badassitude and I'm like, yeah, but THIS is what would give you that last meaningless .1%  
If the biggest complaint I have about your game is that the monsters have irises, you're doing everything else right. lol
        For sure, I'm soooo hyped for this game
        Hell Knight from 2016 with no eyes is way better.
    I have little problem with the redesigns aside from the cacodemons iris and the mancubus. I LOVED the 2016 mancubus design. The dead single eye, mandibles, and armor meshed into its body were cool as fuck. The new ones look too goofy and weird for my tastes.
        yeah i wish they stuck with the tone of 2016 but i’m buying it either way
        My favourite enemy design in 2016 is the revanent and im really not sure why I like the Eternal version less. I def miss some stuff about the old aesthetic, but it's not at all diminishing my hype for Eternal
            I wish we still had the 2016 Cyberdemon, or at least have it as a variation. Even though it didn’t look like the original at all the Balgaar demon had such a cool design it’s a shame it’s gone now.
                Ive seen the new Cyberdemon in the trailer but I don't know much about its role in the new game. Perhaps the new Cyberdemon is a big enemy like it is in Doom 2? Rare, extremely powerful, but not a boss like the Doom 1 or 2016 versions
                    It’s a sub-boss I know that much. I just wish we still had the Balgaar demon in some way, as it had one of my favourite designs in 2016. It would be cool though if it came back even more cyberised in Doom Eternal.
        I never liked the 2016 mancubus, they just looked.... What's the word, lost. I felt sorry every time I killed them because of the pure confusion on their face, now in eternal they look pissed off
    I def like the darker look. The gameplay looks cool, but the cartoonish aspect is a bummer
        Is it a deal breaker tho? And are people really forgetting about the fact that the og cacos had irises? They’re harking back to the old design by giving the thing a proper eyeball now.
            Its not a dealbreaker, but a bummer
                I don’t get why though but I’ve never been one to care about the change in art style of a game.
                    I like the more sinister look. The monsters look extremely pissed off this time, when in doom 2016 there were all kinda dead eyed. Now it's like theres history between us and it comes across in their hateful faces.
                        Agreed and I realized I forgot to add a word in my last comment, I’m never the kind of person to give a shit about a change in art style in a game.
        Agreed.  They leaned too heavily into that "Saturday morning cartoon" idea.
            Is it a deal breaker though?
                Hell no.  Gameplay looks incredible.
        Remember he did partially look cartoony in the 32 bit era
            Im not a purist, i just like the darker tone
                Ok
                I've asked if we can get a third cacodemon
        They seem to be leaning into the Saturday morning cartoon but ultraviolent tone for Eternal. They know how absurd and kind of goofy it is and they aren’t trying to maximize grimdark edginess at the expense of fun. One of the influences for the original Doom was the Evil Dead movies, which combine absurd levels of gore and dismemberment with slapstick and dark humor. Doesn’t matter if you are scared, grossed out, laughing, or some combination as long as it gets a reaction out of you and keeps you entertained.
    Personally I think the new Baron is pretty fucking great, it’s super different from the last one though
    I really don't like the new arcvhile look. I am so excited for Doom eternal however I feel like a lot of the demons took on a more alien look and less demonic. The old archviles were creepy, pale, and them dying had their limbs snapping and sounding demonic as hell. The new one just looks like a generic alien who's been lifting weights his entire life.
        I personally like the new one more. One thing for me is that the old archvile looked a lot squishier than it is
            I'm glad the new ones have fans. Maybe I'm just a grumpy old man. I also miss the noises the old ones made. The cacodemon hissing, the mancubuses fatty gargling noises, and so on. I feel like they all kind of sound the sameish with low bass tones. Regardless this is me being picky because doom 2016 was fucking awesome and im stupid excited for eternal.
> One grenade in the mouth kills me? Really?

*GULP*
you have good eyesight fapper\_keeper, it definitely looks even more so with the old colour scheme
    I'm very familiar with balls, I've had a pair my whole life!
Reminds me of someone
take it out on them, fam
It looks like that was their goal for most of the redesigns.
Yeah, Way better. Really befuddled by some of the changes. Mancubus too.
I can assist you with that
I love it yeah. I'm so happy that doom 2016 included a model viewer
Him AND his little friends!
Everyday mood
Same, it's not just that it looks *different*, it just looks... not as good.
    Yeah, there's a massive disconnect now between DOOM 2016 and its sequel in terms of aesthetic.
I get it. It ain't making me laugh, but I get it.
    Cool.
It's definitely very minor changes, it has eyelids now and got recoloured to match the Doom 1 & 2 colour scheme a bit better. Also it seems to be slightly rounder? Overall I really like how it looks. I just love that its expression is "here we go again"
How do you mean by "this style", like in the Doom 2016 style?
    Either one tbh but I'd love to see the hyperdetailed Eternal version
Senses the Argent energy
    Really? That sounds kinda cool
        That would be my best bet, I would think that's what attracts demons to "teleport" to you and appear out of thin air, perhaps they are pulled there, it may even be outside their control.

They don't kinda turn slowly and "lumber" towards you. Like they see your aura or something but not normal sight.
The colours are very definitely changed to be closer to the original as well, and it also got eyelids to be able to give it that hostile expression instead of a blank one
I'm sorry Jon
That's just where it keeps its spare eye
Deus vult
    wonder how much estrogen it takes to give you a downvote. :o
        Lmao
So you hate an entire model because of one line of black pixels? Talk about overreacting
    8==D <---
Yeah, it does. Hopefully the game play will make up for the shitty redesigns. I'm starting to get a bad feeling though, especially with the "corridor" movement from 2016 being mentioned as a negative.
I'm pretty sure most of the model is the same, but they changed some details and the colors to make it more like the Doom 1&2 design. A lot of the enemies for redesigned to look like their old versions. Cyberdemon, mancubus, human soldiers, revenant

        If you think about it too much then you start to wonder if the caco is the same entity as the one you keep killing.
            I think you deal with multiple cacodemons at some point in doom.
                Who says time fuckery isn't afoot?
                    Perhaps, I've wondered if demons breed or if they are just cloned somehow

I think you deal with multiple cacodemons at some point in doom.
    Who says time fuckery isn't afoot?
        Perhaps, I've wondered if demons breed or if they are just cloned somehow
            Isn't there a map called Spawning Vats?
                If there is I didn't know about it
Is the Cacodemon's name Agrajag by any chance?
look closer. the side teeth are easily different but even the regular teeth are a little shorter and theres more of them.
Ive seen the new Cyberdemon in the trailer but I don't know much about its role in the new game. Perhaps the new Cyberdemon is a big enemy like it is in Doom 2? Rare, extremely powerful, but not a boss like the Doom 1 or 2016 versions
    It’s a sub-boss I know that much. I just wish we still had the Balgaar demon in some way, as it had one of my favourite designs in 2016. It would be cool though if it came back even more cyberised in Doom Eternal.
I don’t get why though but I’ve never been one to care about the change in art style of a game.
    I like the more sinister look. The monsters look extremely pissed off this time, when in doom 2016 there were all kinda dead eyed. Now it's like theres history between us and it comes across in their hateful faces.
        Agreed and I realized I forgot to add a word in my last comment, I’m never the kind of person to give a shit about a change in art style in a game.
Hell no.  Gameplay looks incredible.
Ok
I've asked if we can get a third cacodemon
