[[Ultra nightmare is too hard for me and that's okay]]


I consider myself a somewhat proficient gamer, so I thought ultra-nightmare would be a challenge but achievable. Anyways it took me 5 tries to clear hell on earth and I realised I just wasn't cut out for it. I could see my playstyle just wasn't effective enough to clear the harder difficulties. And I'm fine with that, because I had fun playing it my way on ultraviolence. 
Right now trying to go through nightmare mode and I'm burning through all my extra lives but I can be more relaxed about it and still having tons of fun. It's upped my skill but I doubt I'll ever reach UN level. So for all you people who've finished UN on this sub I wanna say congrats, it really is difficult. Btw nightmare mode has really made me appreciate the different mods and rune setups and how I move.

But the most important thing is having fun :)
5 tries for Hell on Earth? Dude you were killing it. First time i tried ultra nightmare it took me a solid 15 tries to get past Hell on Earth, and another like 40 before I finally beat the Doom Hunters. You know what happened from there? I made it all the way to Taras Nabad on the same run that I made it past The Doom Hunters, then I made it to the 3rd last mission, and then I just beat the game on Ultra Nightmare.

The biggest hurdle with Ultra Nightmare is, and always will be, the first 4 missions, with cultist base being by far the most brutal of the 4. The enjoyment I got beating this game on Ultra Nightmare, and then doing both the dlc’s on Ultra Nightmare as well really can’t be matched, its some of the most fun I have ever had and would recommend ANYONE who has beaten the game on Nightmare to go for it.

I see now you are practicing in nightmare, but I am telling you, Ultra Nightmares biggest hurdle is those first 4 missions, after that, it really gets a lot smoother. Anyone who has beaten the game on Nightmare has 100% the potential to beat Ultra Nightmare, its just a matter of if you want to do it, because Ill admit it became a battle of endurance going back to Hell on Earth about 50 times.
    Damn you tried 50 times, that's some perseverance my guy. How did you know you could do it? I feel like I just keep hitting walls in a playthrough.
        It's like exercise. On a fluke you pull through and do so much more than you thought you could
        You just gotta keep trying. I would recommend doing things you usually wouldn’t do, like saving chainsaw for a mancubus because you know two are coming and you cant deal with both.
        Like the 2 others that replied stated, thats basically all it comes down to. Its not about knowing whether I can or can not do it, its about just knowing what is coming since I beat the game originally, planning for that and beating it. But most of all, its about having fun, if I am having fun I am enjoying the game and getting better the more times I try the same thing. Sometimes you just gotta go for it and not think too much about what happens, just enjoy the game, and if you're not enjoying the game the way you're playing it, then thats fine to. What matters most in ultra nightmare is if you are having fun doing it, soon as the fun stops, thats when you will stop getting better and when you will start worrying so much about your next death because you don't want to restart.
            I think you're right, I'm only playing nightmare right now and the game does seem to get easier once I get the SSG, double dash and heavy weapons. Maybe because I was just more used to doing those combos from my previous playthrough but I found it really hard to beat the game with just the first 3 weapons.
    Dude how did you beat the dlcs on un I had trouble with uv. I'm on controller
        The DLC's were more difficult combat wise (except TAG2), but they were shorter. I beat TAG1 in 3 tries and TAG2 in about 10 tries, granted i just eyeballed TAG2 and never did it on nightmare at all. I play on PC, after beating Ultra nightmare on the main campaign, the massive skill increase i got just made everything a lot easier. My gameplay became much more fluent and precise, I just knew what to do for anything that came my way basically.
Ultra nightmare is more of a strategy thing during early game, since you don’t have your entire arsenal or upgrades. (It is totally fine to look up YouTube UN guides, cynic the original has some great ones)

And in mid to late game it’s more about not messing up and staying calm. If you can get the first three levels consistent UN is a pretty fair challenge. And if you can’t stay calm, use saving throw.

The only thing you really need to know is bosses after that. Just play the crap out of them.
I really advise you to create 2 new save files 1 Nightmare and 1 UN, and go parralel. What I did to finish UN on my first try is I did the level on the Nightmare until I finished it 3 times in a row without dying then proceeded to finish that level on the UN save file and when the level ended I just saved and quit to Nightmare practice again.
    That's actually quiet a good strategy
    This is a great strategy, which I’m doing right now. It’s super effective and has helped me finally get past cultist base!
If you're on pc, changing your keybinds for all your weapons & such to very easy to reach spots makes an enormous difference!, also quick swapping really helps with dps. Chainsaw can sometimes save your life & learning enemy spawns is crucial. With practice and the tips above you can definitely get better over time.
If you're struggling to complete any of the game's content on UN, I got your back with my commentary video walkthrough series where I basically talk about my strategies/thought process and you can also take cues on how I play which can definitely increase your survivability in a permadeath situation. It's really aimed towards players who's trying to complete the game on UN the first time, but even if you beaten it multiple times, you can still learn some stuff.

hell on earth is the hardest level on UN, took me way more tries to beat that than any other level.

Once I made it past CB, I bead DH base and UGN on the first attempt, haven't attempted AC yet but after beating the DLC on Nightmare it's looking really promising.
shit man un took me a year to do the base campaign so your fine for not wanting to go through that misery. right now I'm working on Super gore nest master level  and its god damn soul crushing farthest I've made it is the dual marauders in the toxic goo, and i just struggle to even get back there. either dying to the marauder in the small room with arachnotrons the room with the the toxic goo and fire poles (fuck the gargoyles) the small room with the buff mancubus, the wide open space usually by the  revenants sniping or the baron in the one building or accidently backing into a tentacle. or i get killed in the toxic room with the 2 buff totems
Good thing is you don't have to do Ultra Nightmare, for instance I'm doing extra-life (or what it's called) mode and I will never do Ultra Nightmare, never ever.   
Mainly because I can't leave whenever I want, and I can't sit 5h non-stop infront of a PC.   
So yeah, in my case, fuck UN
    You can leave after each mission.
I've finished nightmare but I have a hard time with ultra nightmare and it beyond frustrates me,all of my flaws I only noticed when playing this mode,and it's hard to stay dedicated
im on console and i did hell on earth first try,  
...im abit surprised to see everyone struggling with the first part. i doubted myself for a minute  


and yea UN is realllyyyy hard. it's a bitch to do
