That Would be awesome as a late game upgrade The BFF - THE BIG FUCKING FIST OF DOOM
    So....The Blood Punch
        Yes, BUT THE BLOOD PUNCH OF DOOM
            The BFP
                BFBP?

**B**ig **F**ucking **B**lood **P**unch?
                    **B**lood **F**ucking **P**unch
                        BP10000
                    The BBP
            iskall?
        But replace it with a green BFG lightning effect, give it a small windup and up the damage. Fuck yeah I'd use that
        I really think they missed the opportunity have have the Blood Punch be the Berserker instead. In the original DooM games, the Berserker was basically a blood punch anyways.
            In the original doom games berserk was kinda garbage.
                What? It gave you 100% health and quadrupled the damage you did with your fist for the entire level. How is that garbage?
                    I mean as a berserk powerup. It feels like it’s supposed to be a short term boost but it’s actually just a health pack and brass knuckles pickup. Trying to use it like a berserk pickup from modern games just kills you since you get no defensive boosts and they tend to place it in traps. So you have to swap back to your weapons.
                        Yeah, I guess if you suck it does. Get good, kid.  ;)

-Sincerely, an old timer
                            I beat it on the hardest traditional difficulty. I used the berserk boost a few times for ammo preservation. But as a berserk pickup it’s awful. It’s just a melee boost and health pack, and trying to use it as a modern berserk pickup is suicide.
                                I don’t get how the original berserk pickup from any game ever could be awful. It’s literally the original. I think you just don’t know how to use it or you’re not good. I guess we’ll just have to agree to disagree.
                                    If one showed up mid fight picking it up would kill me due to it swapping my weapon. The only time it was good was when the game spawns berserk and invincibility next to each other.
    That's somebody's fetish.
        When.
    Sounds like a good new mechanic in the dlc.
    That’s cool In all but like… could he jerk off with it tho?
    I thing Big Fucking Guy is better concept.
    This is brilliant

    Everyone knows Doomslayer + Samus = Master Chief
        There’s no other way to explain Chief’s unbelievable levels of ~~plot armor~~ luck
            He was adrift for 4 years in space and found a functional planet. What kinda bs luck is that
                He always gets a nat 20 on  his luck roles.
                    He got dealt some bad deals. He was kidnapped at a young age and forced through traumatizing training.

Had to watch every other spartan die, only for them to be replaced like old shoes. 

All his other "friends" also died in front of him.

And Cortana went batshit on him.


Although I dont think any of this got through to him because its stated that he displays "sociopathic tendencies"
                        Tbf he just would have been glassed if he wasn't abducted, though I'm not sure which fate is worse...
                            At least he was a toddler when his planet was glassed. He wouldnt know he was about to die. 



Now that I said it, that doesnt sound much better
                                The knowledge that you're about to die is what makes it bad
                                    Definitely not the incinerated death part.
                                Master Chief wasn’t a toddler. By that point he was already 16 I believe
                                    I could be wrong. I haven't finished the books
                                    Closer to 6 than 16.
                                    Correct. The Covenant didn't appear until after the Spartans complete their missions to bring down the Rebellion. I forget exactly when, but i want to say they were twenty-something when Cole took his fleet against the first Covenant ship.
                        I believe the books indicate that it does affect him heavily, but he puts duty first, putting on a facade.

Halo 5 has a good moment where the rest of Blue Team talk about how Chief isn't resting and keeps going on mission after mission. He trying to not think about it.
                            I played halo when I was younger and didnt understand the story and just has fun kicking alien butt.

Coming back to the series I now see that chief is a pretty depressing character.
                            He has to focus on duty. It's his coping mechanism. 

If he slows down long enough to actually think about how shitty life is he would have a nervous breakdown probably.
                                And it could’ve messed him up in critical moments where he ended up saving the entire human race
                        Pretty sure the doom slayer losing his rabbit was more emotionally scarring
                            And being trapped in hell doing nothing but killing demons 24/7 for several millennia.
                                Eh it was a healthy anger release mechanism
                                    When he was found collapsed next a wall all he could think about was killing demons. 

He is not healthy
                        That's what they want you to think... Sammy and Flynn shipped him off to be a  super soldier like themselves.
                            Flynn? No I choose to believe his name is William like his great granddad, that Flynn guy gets into too much crazy shit for my tastes.
                                The canon name of Doom Slayer is Flynn Taggart


Source: [lmao](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomguy)
                                    He does go by a lot of different names, one of them is BJ Blazkowicz III so to hell with it, my headcanon is that his name William J Blazkowicz III.
                                    [Wikipedia is not a reliable source](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_is_not_a_reliable_source)
                I always figured that Cortana is using her advanced hyper intelligence to help him pull these things off. Like she'd be pulling strings 5 days prior, or longer, to an event to make sure that it all goes well. Just because she's simulated it out a million different ways and knows what strings to pull. She would also know to limit the information she feeds to MC in order to make sure events go towards the ideal simulated result. She probably picked him as her host because she knew he would trust her long before he did. My thinking is that she guided him to the suit and sent it on the correct trajectory before they were set adrift. This plan was only feasible because she knew a planet was 4 years away.

To me, a lot of the inspiration for Cortana seems to be the Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy Mk2. My personal favorite AI guide. If i'm not mistaken (i probably am) it's the FIRST AI assistant in fiction! The Mk2 was sufficiently more advanced than the original guide and only ever had one copy made. It was sort of a magical genie in how it worked. Very cool stuff. I recommend that 5 part trilogy quite a bit.  (6 now if you consider the new author's work. Yes. Still a trilogy. Deal with it!)
                    In halo 3 she states she picked chief because he was "special", so your theory does have some meat on its bones
                        About as much meat as a Revenant I'm afraid. It's always been my personal head canon but I don't mind if people would object to it.
                    In one of the novels MC asked Cortana to calculate the correct timing for deflecting a rocket coming straight his direction. So, you're probably not wrong with her pulling the strings
                        She's crazy advanced and nobody really got a chance to study her and how she works before she was deployed. Reach is where she comes online. If i remember right, she's a digital clone of her creator's mind, on top of a lot of hyper advanced processing matrixs. The only AI that was created from a living mind instead of a dead one. If that's correct then she (Cortana) has all that foundational knowledge of how to redevelop and maintain herself to avoid their kind of death. She is estimated to be 1000s of times more intelligent than a human.

Because of these posts I ended up in a Cortana rabbit hole and discovered her first words.  

>Quando il gioco è finito, il re e il pedone vanno nella stessa scatola." This phrase translates to "When the game is over, the king and the pawn go in the same box." The phrase was spoken by Halsey's mother after their first game of chess.

Right from inception she's thinking about the endgame with a sick chess metaphor. How cool is that?

AI's in HALOverse are pretty cool. They put a ton of thought into writing them.
                            Yes, that's one of the reasons why i love the Halo universe
                            And then she dies and comes back as a Tyrannical Bitch best on ruling the galaxy, I hate what 343 did with her character in 5.
                                My theory on that is one of compromise. A fragment of her went crazy in that regard, as that's what ais in the haloverse do. Cortana was the only one that could fragment herself and rebuild afaik. My guess is due to the fact that she's a digital clone of an AI Scientist. When she sacrificed herself, I think she made fragments in as many systems as she could if i'm not mistaken.

I think that was essentially a Spock style sacrifice, where he copied himself into Bones before doing it, but her resurrection is taking place over a longer period than a low budget sequel starring Doc Brown (brownface get it?! Startrek III Search for Spock for the uninitiated)
                    In one of the books, chief is being tested by some official that doesn't like Halsey's programs and wants his own to be funded. Its the first time he wears the suit and meets Cortana and the guy basically tries to kill chief.

He had to make his way past a minefield and at the end an attack helicopter (can't remember what they called it) and it shoots a missile. Cortana helps boost his own hyper advanced reflexes because he can't outrun it, he basically jumps to the side at the last second and slaps the missile away from him. It still hits the ground close to him but it was enough for him to survive
                A forerunner AI named Mendicent Bias guides him there. Its explained in Halo 4 that Chief's entire existence has been planned for 100,000 years and he has been instilled with a Forerunner geas (basically artificial intuition) to do what he does throughout the series.
                    I wouldnt have known that. I cant bring myself to finish halo 4. 

It's so bad
                *Mendicant Bias sent him to Requiem to beat the Ur-Didact
        Too many people are replying to this comment not realizing he means doomguy(dad) + Samus(mom) = master chief(son), as a little joke
        [deleted]
            I just realized I think you misunderstood what I said, not Doomslayer + Samus = Master Chief as in power, but Doomslayer + Samus = Master Chief as in family
            Samus outclasses all of them considering she can shoot black holes and do other magical dumb shit and blow up planets.

Doomguy is also not just some demon terminator.  Eternal talks about how he regained his consciousness while he served with the sentinels, he just refused to talk afterwards.  He clearly has a room in his fortress where he plays games and reads magazines.

He doesn't one punch shit into oblivion outside of that one powerup.  Doomguy was always just a dude that overcame impossible odds through sheer force of will and hatred.  The new series just gave him a powerboost.
                That one powerup is charged up just by ripping and tearing one or two fodder demons. It happens much more often than just one time.  

"He only punches shit into oblivion when he does!"  Good point. I guess.

His super advanced UAE armor helps a lot too. Samus shoots black holes okay neat, but Doom Guy has a sentinel blade and could probably turn that black hole into some crazy fodder hell portal with it. Vega would just tell him to ram the sword into it then kick it with his huge boot.

DOOM Guy doesn't play by your Smash Bros rules.
            Samus is a human-alien hybrid. She was infused with Chozo DNA and then in Fusion, Metroid DNA from that vaccine they had to give her to cure her of the X-Parasite.
            Samus = human who was buffed via alien DNA

Master Chief = human who was buffed via technology

Doomguy = human who was buffed via divine energy
                And before that just buff
            Were you there when it happened?
            No they're NOT different series! I can play as Samus and MC in Doom Eternal. You didnt know about the super secret cheat code? After you get all the regular cheats unlocked, you have to go to the main menu and press A,B,A,C,A,B,B

Then you will hear a sound saying

"GET OVER HEREEEEE"

Then you can pick them as costumes
                The funny thing is I could imagine id actually doing something like that.
                My favorite code!
                [deleted]
                    > From the Code of Honor screen, press A, B, A, C, A, B, B. If this was done correctly, the text will turn yellow and you will hear Scorpion say "Get over here!" 

My memory isn't always the best, but this is locked in as hard as the alphabet is. I was entering this code dozens of times daily for years. It has and always will alternate b then c then b b
        The slayer is stronger than cheif tho..........
            Genetic deterioration?
                The slayer is literaly a fixed POINT in all realities in all universes in all timelines there is only 1 slayer throughout all possible time lines and realities there is ONLY 1. And hes writtwn to be the biggest immortal badass ever his 

((plot armor)) if it stands against him be it immortal or not he will find a way to kill it destroy it OR become more powerful than it to defeate it to were it is unable to cause any more harm))

Ghost Rider + DoomSlayer.         OOOOOO_OOOOOO
                    I thought you were saying how if chief is the son of the slayer, why is he weaker
                        If DS actually had a child that child would grow to surpass him in everyway. So I was asking if mc is the slayers son why would MC not.be the one throwing the punch O_o.   

It was just a dumb brain fart x-x
                            Perhaps the argent energy in the slayers sperm and the phazon in Samus’ egg caused microscopic super novas that caused the chief to undergo genetic deterioration?
                                Fuck it let’s go with that also I’d like to imagine those super novas just made Samus cum for hours after her and the slayer’s week long fucking.
                                    Legend says that the flood was never caused by a massive storm but from a portal that leaked out the century long orgasms
                                Eh. It was a dumb brain failer.  

Tho Slayers fuel =  His infinite rage / Argent via exposure and fighting In hell for eons / Makyr Blood ((makyr magik))
                                    Perhaps
                            Tell that to Zeus' children. A father always dreams their child will surpass them but it's not always the case. Even gods have flaws.
                                Shh you'll hjrt there feelings
                                    You hear that GODS?!  EVEN YOU HAVE FLAWS!!!

f the police
            When a man and a woman love each other very much...
        Nah master chief is adopted (canonically the slayer doesn't even know what sex is)
            Isn't it the same or similar to Goku though? He doesn't know about sex stuff?
                No Goku has had it multiple times but the Slayer has not once
                    Both of our comments said "know what sex is" and "know about sex stuff", not "has had sex".
        The UNSC would regret that kidnapping.
        This is canon, now.
        If Doom Slayer is dad, Samus must be mo/um?
        You cant add 5 and 2 and get 3
    And a dash of My Hero Academia
        *You Say Run starts playing*
    I thought this was supposed to be the Incredibles, the end of the final fight when they remember to use the remote against the robot.
Serious Series: Blood Punch
    Except of a loud thundering sound it's a earrape version of BFG DIVISION
    Does that mean that Elena Richardson is Genos?
Blood punch
    The BFP
        The Blood Fucking Punch
Warning the BFG 10,000 is firing
I got that reference!
Pluuuus ULTRAAAAAAAAAA!
    DETROIT SMASH!!!!
        Where did the name for that move come from btw
            He went over to the states for a few years and while there he named some of them after the states
            My hero academia
                No I mean, where did All Might get the name from
                    America i guess. All if his power moves are named after american states, except for that one time he said "united states smash"
                    De...troit?

Like, what are you even asking bro?
                    Since Detroit’s a famous US city, AM just throught it sounded cool.
        Well it’s hell on earth so let’s call it canon.

The "Doomguy, Samus, & Chief are a family" idea is absolutely one of my favorite crossover fandom trends to exist!
Best part is Chief calling the Slayer daddy.
    Hey, Daddy is not on the table here.
        You're right. Daddy is the one who bends OTHERS onto the table.
The punch should be called the BFP (big fucking punch)
    >blood fucking punch

**FTFY**
you see, Spartan, to shoot the accurate you must become gun
Punches demon
"Umf"
Big fucking guy
    Big fucking guys.
ARGENT SMASH!!!!
This reminds me of all Mights Detroit smash from MHA
    Same! And I think that was the point, and it opened the door to a very (while admittedly unlikely) interesting concept. 

BNHA x Doom
I kinda want a crossover now..
You may have heard these words before, but *I'll teach you what they really mean*

RIP

AND

TEAR
The BFG is just an empty barrel for the Slayer to channel his energy
I just love the “Badass Family” that has been made. Doom Guy and Samus are the mom and dad, and Master Chief and Issac Clark are their sons
    Issac Clark, the son with PTSD.

“CUT OFF THEIR LIMBS!!!!”
        I was actually going tyo draw asomething like this lmao
            Nice, hope it turns out great
BFG = big fucking guy
Megaman is required in this too.  He's also a mechanized warrior human. It's X who is the entirely synthetic being. We could count androids too though I wouldn't mind at all!

But wait! There's more!

Rad Spencer, Jackson "Jax" Briggs, Adam Jensen, Cmdr Shepard, Genji, Michael "Psycho" Sykes, Raiden, Syndicate soldiers, Robocop, Bomberman, Vault Dweller in Power armor, Barret Wallace,  Keanu Reeves

I left so many out, especially 90% of Mortal Kombat, trying to limit it to one character per game.  My point is, the Cyborgers could really be quite the "assembled" team if you think about it.  (pun intended)

Doom Slayer is the ideal Hulk. You've done well.  I love this a lot.
    Mega Man and X are both straight up robots, for the record.
        I swear I thought I seen a comic once about the blue bomber that said he was part man but I suppose I invented that memory. Thank you for correcting me.
"Samus in the back:
Wut?
this is the ending of half life alyx
Daddy?!?!?
I just realized now that BFG stands for Big Fucking Gun
**B**ig **F**ucking **G**uy.
One puuuuuuuuuuuuuncch!
BFG armor would be fucking sick  


imagine how it'd look
Big Fucking Gains?
Argent Blood Punch would be a neat idea to play with in the DLC or even whatever comes after Doom Eternal.

&#x200B;

Also, its strange reading this my head and having an official voice to base the Slayer off of next to Master Chief who I've heard for decades.
    Every time you use thr blood punch that thundering echo you hear after it is it sending shocks through all reality
In 1993 this is what I always did, I only used the shotgun, plasma gun if out of ammo. Doesn't matter if it was a cyber demon or an imp, shotgun.
Omfg they should add that
*heavy metal intensifies*
I AM THE MARKETING DEPARTMENT
BIG

FUCKING

GUY
He IS the Big Fucking Guy
Big
Fucking
Gun
Turns into the Big Friendly Giant.
Hmm, is anyone has the og post?
I don’t like to imagine doom guy is the father of Samus and master chief
    It would be especially weird since Samus predates Doomguy by seven years.
        Also her parents were eaten
Doot Trumper-9000
As soon as I saw Dad I was like: Nani?! Doomguy has a child?! Till I realized it was le Master Chief
    Also, wouldn't it be super badass if Doomguy actually could combine the BFG with his suit?! Next game?? *wink* *wink*
What does BFG even stand for? Big Fat Gun?
    Very close, it's a different F
        Big Fucking Gun?
            Yes
                Oh okay Thanks bro
The BFG is just doomguy but a gun

Therefore doomguy used doomguy to kill demons
I read this in cheifs voice
the shockwave from the blood punch is so good it can one-shot an entire group of enemies and seriously injure super heavies.
it's fucking broken, don't sleep on the blood punch.
Even tho Master Chief is a demon.
berserk mode be like
The big fucking guy
Annnnnnd saved.
After that one scene in the Mars Core mission, this is now a fact
оо
Those two had better be fuckin’ adopted cuz we all know Doomguy doesn’t fuck.
Source of the comic?
Green Samus for smash?
i love this image so (redacted) much
THE BIO FORCE PUNCH!🔋🔋🔋

Imagine doom slayer and samus having a custody fight over master cheif
I can see it happening
I am the big fucking gun
Son?
    Dad?
Dad?  Na.. that part was dumb
Doom guy is best dad for accepting Samus's sex change
LOVE THIS! And it is true, Doom Guy IS the dad. MC and Samus and Wolfenstein and all those other people are his children.
    Wolfenstein pre-dates Doom. B.J. was even a direct ancestor of both Commander Keen and Doomguy in the RPG lore.
    Samus was first.
        Thats only because the world wasnt ready to see her father yet. See Doom is really a prequel to Metroid on NES...
So would Samus be Grandma?
I like the idea of Doom Slayer being the dad of Master Chief
This triple crossover needs to stop right now !
BFG for all upvote if you get it
that is my secret son

i am the **big fucking gun**
    You said the same thing as the meme but bfg not being an acronym.
Did someone edit in the dad and son part???? why????
I know this is just a cool comic, but, like, can we just let different games be different games? I'm getting so exhausted of these crossover things. I know they are just games, but if I was a hardcore Halo fan this would probably offend me and piss me off, they are completely different ideas and games...I appreciate both sides of this but I think we might be taking these things too far.

i dont get people associating the slayer with the loser from halo.

        The slayer needs no words other than rip and tear
So....The Blood Punch
    Yes, BUT THE BLOOD PUNCH OF DOOM
        The BFP
            BFBP?

**B**ig **F**ucking **B**lood **P**unch?
                **B**lood **F**ucking **P**unch
                    BP10000
                The BBP
        iskall?
    But replace it with a green BFG lightning effect, give it a small windup and up the damage. Fuck yeah I'd use that
    I really think they missed the opportunity have have the Blood Punch be the Berserker instead. In the original DooM games, the Berserker was basically a blood punch anyways.
        In the original doom games berserk was kinda garbage.
            What? It gave you 100% health and quadrupled the damage you did with your fist for the entire level. How is that garbage?
                I mean as a berserk powerup. It feels like it’s supposed to be a short term boost but it’s actually just a health pack and brass knuckles pickup. Trying to use it like a berserk pickup from modern games just kills you since you get no defensive boosts and they tend to place it in traps. So you have to swap back to your weapons.
                    Yeah, I guess if you suck it does. Get good, kid.  ;)

-Sincerely, an old timer
                        I beat it on the hardest traditional difficulty. I used the berserk boost a few times for ammo preservation. But as a berserk pickup it’s awful. It’s just a melee boost and health pack, and trying to use it as a modern berserk pickup is suicide.
                            I don’t get how the original berserk pickup from any game ever could be awful. It’s literally the original. I think you just don’t know how to use it or you’re not good. I guess we’ll just have to agree to disagree.
                                If one showed up mid fight picking it up would kill me due to it swapping my weapon. The only time it was good was when the game spawns berserk and invincibility next to each other.
That's somebody's fetish.
    When.
Sounds like a good new mechanic in the dlc.
That’s cool In all but like… could he jerk off with it tho?
I thing Big Fucking Guy is better concept.
This is brilliant
Everyone knows Doomslayer + Samus = Master Chief
    There’s no other way to explain Chief’s unbelievable levels of ~~plot armor~~ luck
        He was adrift for 4 years in space and found a functional planet. What kinda bs luck is that
            He always gets a nat 20 on  his luck roles.
                He got dealt some bad deals. He was kidnapped at a young age and forced through traumatizing training.

Had to watch every other spartan die, only for them to be replaced like old shoes. 

All his other "friends" also died in front of him.

And Cortana went batshit on him.


Although I dont think any of this got through to him because its stated that he displays "sociopathic tendencies"
                    Tbf he just would have been glassed if he wasn't abducted, though I'm not sure which fate is worse...
                        At least he was a toddler when his planet was glassed. He wouldnt know he was about to die. 



Now that I said it, that doesnt sound much better
                            The knowledge that you're about to die is what makes it bad
                                Definitely not the incinerated death part.
                            Master Chief wasn’t a toddler. By that point he was already 16 I believe
                                I could be wrong. I haven't finished the books
                                Closer to 6 than 16.
                                Correct. The Covenant didn't appear until after the Spartans complete their missions to bring down the Rebellion. I forget exactly when, but i want to say they were twenty-something when Cole took his fleet against the first Covenant ship.
                    I believe the books indicate that it does affect him heavily, but he puts duty first, putting on a facade.

Halo 5 has a good moment where the rest of Blue Team talk about how Chief isn't resting and keeps going on mission after mission. He trying to not think about it.
                        I played halo when I was younger and didnt understand the story and just has fun kicking alien butt.

Coming back to the series I now see that chief is a pretty depressing character.
                        He has to focus on duty. It's his coping mechanism. 

If he slows down long enough to actually think about how shitty life is he would have a nervous breakdown probably.
                            And it could’ve messed him up in critical moments where he ended up saving the entire human race
                    Pretty sure the doom slayer losing his rabbit was more emotionally scarring
                        And being trapped in hell doing nothing but killing demons 24/7 for several millennia.
                            Eh it was a healthy anger release mechanism
                                When he was found collapsed next a wall all he could think about was killing demons. 

He is not healthy
                    That's what they want you to think... Sammy and Flynn shipped him off to be a  super soldier like themselves.
                        Flynn? No I choose to believe his name is William like his great granddad, that Flynn guy gets into too much crazy shit for my tastes.
                            The canon name of Doom Slayer is Flynn Taggart


Source: [lmao](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomguy)
                                He does go by a lot of different names, one of them is BJ Blazkowicz III so to hell with it, my headcanon is that his name William J Blazkowicz III.
                                [Wikipedia is not a reliable source](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_is_not_a_reliable_source)
            I always figured that Cortana is using her advanced hyper intelligence to help him pull these things off. Like she'd be pulling strings 5 days prior, or longer, to an event to make sure that it all goes well. Just because she's simulated it out a million different ways and knows what strings to pull. She would also know to limit the information she feeds to MC in order to make sure events go towards the ideal simulated result. She probably picked him as her host because she knew he would trust her long before he did. My thinking is that she guided him to the suit and sent it on the correct trajectory before they were set adrift. This plan was only feasible because she knew a planet was 4 years away.

To me, a lot of the inspiration for Cortana seems to be the Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy Mk2. My personal favorite AI guide. If i'm not mistaken (i probably am) it's the FIRST AI assistant in fiction! The Mk2 was sufficiently more advanced than the original guide and only ever had one copy made. It was sort of a magical genie in how it worked. Very cool stuff. I recommend that 5 part trilogy quite a bit.  (6 now if you consider the new author's work. Yes. Still a trilogy. Deal with it!)
                In halo 3 she states she picked chief because he was "special", so your theory does have some meat on its bones
                    About as much meat as a Revenant I'm afraid. It's always been my personal head canon but I don't mind if people would object to it.
                In one of the novels MC asked Cortana to calculate the correct timing for deflecting a rocket coming straight his direction. So, you're probably not wrong with her pulling the strings
                    She's crazy advanced and nobody really got a chance to study her and how she works before she was deployed. Reach is where she comes online. If i remember right, she's a digital clone of her creator's mind, on top of a lot of hyper advanced processing matrixs. The only AI that was created from a living mind instead of a dead one. If that's correct then she (Cortana) has all that foundational knowledge of how to redevelop and maintain herself to avoid their kind of death. She is estimated to be 1000s of times more intelligent than a human.

Because of these posts I ended up in a Cortana rabbit hole and discovered her first words.  

>Quando il gioco è finito, il re e il pedone vanno nella stessa scatola." This phrase translates to "When the game is over, the king and the pawn go in the same box." The phrase was spoken by Halsey's mother after their first game of chess.

Right from inception she's thinking about the endgame with a sick chess metaphor. How cool is that?

AI's in HALOverse are pretty cool. They put a ton of thought into writing them.
                        Yes, that's one of the reasons why i love the Halo universe
                        And then she dies and comes back as a Tyrannical Bitch best on ruling the galaxy, I hate what 343 did with her character in 5.
                            My theory on that is one of compromise. A fragment of her went crazy in that regard, as that's what ais in the haloverse do. Cortana was the only one that could fragment herself and rebuild afaik. My guess is due to the fact that she's a digital clone of an AI Scientist. When she sacrificed herself, I think she made fragments in as many systems as she could if i'm not mistaken.

I think that was essentially a Spock style sacrifice, where he copied himself into Bones before doing it, but her resurrection is taking place over a longer period than a low budget sequel starring Doc Brown (brownface get it?! Startrek III Search for Spock for the uninitiated)
                In one of the books, chief is being tested by some official that doesn't like Halsey's programs and wants his own to be funded. Its the first time he wears the suit and meets Cortana and the guy basically tries to kill chief.

He had to make his way past a minefield and at the end an attack helicopter (can't remember what they called it) and it shoots a missile. Cortana helps boost his own hyper advanced reflexes because he can't outrun it, he basically jumps to the side at the last second and slaps the missile away from him. It still hits the ground close to him but it was enough for him to survive
            A forerunner AI named Mendicent Bias guides him there. Its explained in Halo 4 that Chief's entire existence has been planned for 100,000 years and he has been instilled with a Forerunner geas (basically artificial intuition) to do what he does throughout the series.
                I wouldnt have known that. I cant bring myself to finish halo 4. 

It's so bad
            *Mendicant Bias sent him to Requiem to beat the Ur-Didact
    Too many people are replying to this comment not realizing he means doomguy(dad) + Samus(mom) = master chief(son), as a little joke
    [deleted]
        I just realized I think you misunderstood what I said, not Doomslayer + Samus = Master Chief as in power, but Doomslayer + Samus = Master Chief as in family
        Samus outclasses all of them considering she can shoot black holes and do other magical dumb shit and blow up planets.

Doomguy is also not just some demon terminator.  Eternal talks about how he regained his consciousness while he served with the sentinels, he just refused to talk afterwards.  He clearly has a room in his fortress where he plays games and reads magazines.

He doesn't one punch shit into oblivion outside of that one powerup.  Doomguy was always just a dude that overcame impossible odds through sheer force of will and hatred.  The new series just gave him a powerboost.
            That one powerup is charged up just by ripping and tearing one or two fodder demons. It happens much more often than just one time.  

"He only punches shit into oblivion when he does!"  Good point. I guess.

His super advanced UAE armor helps a lot too. Samus shoots black holes okay neat, but Doom Guy has a sentinel blade and could probably turn that black hole into some crazy fodder hell portal with it. Vega would just tell him to ram the sword into it then kick it with his huge boot.

DOOM Guy doesn't play by your Smash Bros rules.
        Samus is a human-alien hybrid. She was infused with Chozo DNA and then in Fusion, Metroid DNA from that vaccine they had to give her to cure her of the X-Parasite.
        Samus = human who was buffed via alien DNA

Master Chief = human who was buffed via technology

Doomguy = human who was buffed via divine energy
            And before that just buff
        Were you there when it happened?
        No they're NOT different series! I can play as Samus and MC in Doom Eternal. You didnt know about the super secret cheat code? After you get all the regular cheats unlocked, you have to go to the main menu and press A,B,A,C,A,B,B

Then you will hear a sound saying

"GET OVER HEREEEEE"

Then you can pick them as costumes
            The funny thing is I could imagine id actually doing something like that.
            My favorite code!
            [deleted]
                > From the Code of Honor screen, press A, B, A, C, A, B, B. If this was done correctly, the text will turn yellow and you will hear Scorpion say "Get over here!" 

My memory isn't always the best, but this is locked in as hard as the alphabet is. I was entering this code dozens of times daily for years. It has and always will alternate b then c then b b
    The slayer is stronger than cheif tho..........
        Genetic deterioration?
            The slayer is literaly a fixed POINT in all realities in all universes in all timelines there is only 1 slayer throughout all possible time lines and realities there is ONLY 1. And hes writtwn to be the biggest immortal badass ever his 

((plot armor)) if it stands against him be it immortal or not he will find a way to kill it destroy it OR become more powerful than it to defeate it to were it is unable to cause any more harm))

Ghost Rider + DoomSlayer.         OOOOOO_OOOOOO
                I thought you were saying how if chief is the son of the slayer, why is he weaker
                    If DS actually had a child that child would grow to surpass him in everyway. So I was asking if mc is the slayers son why would MC not.be the one throwing the punch O_o.   

It was just a dumb brain fart x-x
                        Perhaps the argent energy in the slayers sperm and the phazon in Samus’ egg caused microscopic super novas that caused the chief to undergo genetic deterioration?
                            Fuck it let’s go with that also I’d like to imagine those super novas just made Samus cum for hours after her and the slayer’s week long fucking.
                                Legend says that the flood was never caused by a massive storm but from a portal that leaked out the century long orgasms
                            Eh. It was a dumb brain failer.  

Tho Slayers fuel =  His infinite rage / Argent via exposure and fighting In hell for eons / Makyr Blood ((makyr magik))
                                Perhaps
                        Tell that to Zeus' children. A father always dreams their child will surpass them but it's not always the case. Even gods have flaws.
                            Shh you'll hjrt there feelings
                                You hear that GODS?!  EVEN YOU HAVE FLAWS!!!

f the police
        When a man and a woman love each other very much...
    Nah master chief is adopted (canonically the slayer doesn't even know what sex is)
        Isn't it the same or similar to Goku though? He doesn't know about sex stuff?
            No Goku has had it multiple times but the Slayer has not once
                Both of our comments said "know what sex is" and "know about sex stuff", not "has had sex".
    The UNSC would regret that kidnapping.
    This is canon, now.
    If Doom Slayer is dad, Samus must be mo/um?
    You cant add 5 and 2 and get 3
And a dash of My Hero Academia
    *You Say Run starts playing*
I thought this was supposed to be the Incredibles, the end of the final fight when they remember to use the remote against the robot.
Except of a loud thundering sound it's a earrape version of BFG DIVISION
Does that mean that Elena Richardson is Genos?
The BFP
    The Blood Fucking Punch
DETROIT SMASH!!!!
    Where did the name for that move come from btw
        He went over to the states for a few years and while there he named some of them after the states
        My hero academia
            No I mean, where did All Might get the name from
                America i guess. All if his power moves are named after american states, except for that one time he said "united states smash"
                De...troit?

Like, what are you even asking bro?
                Since Detroit’s a famous US city, AM just throught it sounded cool.
    Well it’s hell on earth so let’s call it canon.

Same! And I think that was the point, and it opened the door to a very (while admittedly unlikely) interesting concept. 

BNHA x Doom

    I was actually going tyo draw asomething like this lmao
        Nice, hope it turns out great
Mega Man and X are both straight up robots, for the record.
    I swear I thought I seen a comic once about the blue bomber that said he was part man but I suppose I invented that memory. Thank you for correcting me.
Every time you use thr blood punch that thundering echo you hear after it is it sending shocks through all reality
It would be especially weird since Samus predates Doomguy by seven years.
    Also her parents were eaten
Also, wouldn't it be super badass if Doomguy actually could combine the BFG with his suit?! Next game?? *wink* *wink*
Very close, it's a different F
    Big Fucking Gun?
        Yes
            Oh okay Thanks bro
Dad?
Wolfenstein pre-dates Doom. B.J. was even a direct ancestor of both Commander Keen and Doomguy in the RPG lore.
Samus was first.
    Thats only because the world wasnt ready to see her father yet. See Doom is really a prequel to Metroid on NES...
You said the same thing as the meme but bfg not being an acronym.

My thinking is that she guided him to the suit and sent it on the correct trajectory before they were set adrift. This plan was only feasible because she knew a planet was 4 years away.

To me, a lot of the inspiration for Cortana seems to be the Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy Mk2. My personal favorite AI guide. If i'm not mistaken (i probably am) it's the FIRST AI assistant in fiction! The Mk2 was sufficiently more advanced than the original guide and only ever had one copy made. It was sort of a magical genie in how it worked. Very cool stuff. I recommend that 5 part trilogy quite a bit.  (6 now if you consider the new author's work. Yes. Still a trilogy. Deal with it!)
            In halo 3 she states she picked chief because he was "special", so your theory does have some meat on its bones
                About as much meat as a Revenant I'm afraid. It's always been my personal head canon but I don't mind if people would object to it.
            In one of the novels MC asked Cortana to calculate the correct timing for deflecting a rocket coming straight his direction. So, you're probably not wrong with her pulling the strings
                She's crazy advanced and nobody really got a chance to study her and how she works before she was deployed. Reach is where she comes online. If i remember right, she's a digital clone of her creator's mind, on top of a lot of hyper advanced processing matrixs. The only AI that was created from a living mind instead of a dead one. If that's correct then she (Cortana) has all that foundational knowledge of how to redevelop and maintain herself to avoid their kind of death. She is estimated to be 1000s of times more intelligent than a human.

Because of these posts I ended up in a Cortana rabbit hole and discovered her first words.  

>Quando il gioco è finito, il re e il pedone vanno nella stessa scatola." This phrase translates to "When the game is over, the king and the pawn go in the same box." The phrase was spoken by Halsey's mother after their first game of chess.

Right from inception she's thinking about the endgame with a sick chess metaphor. How cool is that?

AI's in HALOverse are pretty cool. They put a ton of thought into writing them.
                    Yes, that's one of the reasons why i love the Halo universe
                    And then she dies and comes back as a Tyrannical Bitch best on ruling the galaxy, I hate what 343 did with her character in 5.
                        My theory on that is one of compromise. A fragment of her went crazy in that regard, as that's what ais in the haloverse do. Cortana was the only one that could fragment herself and rebuild afaik. My guess is due to the fact that she's a digital clone of an AI Scientist. When she sacrificed herself, I think she made fragments in as many systems as she could if i'm not mistaken.

I think that was essentially a Spock style sacrifice, where he copied himself into Bones before doing it, but her resurrection is taking place over a longer period than a low budget sequel starring Doc Brown (brownface get it?! Startrek III Search for Spock for the uninitiated)
            In one of the books, chief is being tested by some official that doesn't like Halsey's programs and wants his own to be funded. Its the first time he wears the suit and meets Cortana and the guy basically tries to kill chief.

He had to make his way past a minefield and at the end an attack helicopter (can't remember what they called it) and it shoots a missile. Cortana helps boost his own hyper advanced reflexes because he can't outrun it, he basically jumps to the side at the last second and slaps the missile away from him. It still hits the ground close to him but it was enough for him to survive
        A forerunner AI named Mendicent Bias guides him there. Its explained in Halo 4 that Chief's entire existence has been planned for 100,000 years and he has been instilled with a Forerunner geas (basically artificial intuition) to do what he does throughout the series.
            I wouldnt have known that. I cant bring myself to finish halo 4. 

It's so bad
        *Mendicant Bias sent him to Requiem to beat the Ur-Didact
Too many people are replying to this comment not realizing he means doomguy(dad) + Samus(mom) = master chief(son), as a little joke
[deleted]
    I just realized I think you misunderstood what I said, not Doomslayer + Samus = Master Chief as in power, but Doomslayer + Samus = Master Chief as in family
    Samus outclasses all of them considering she can shoot black holes and do other magical dumb shit and blow up planets.

Doomguy is also not just some demon terminator.  Eternal talks about how he regained his consciousness while he served with the sentinels, he just refused to talk afterwards.  He clearly has a room in his fortress where he plays games and reads magazines.

He doesn't one punch shit into oblivion outside of that one powerup.  Doomguy was always just a dude that overcame impossible odds through sheer force of will and hatred.  The new series just gave him a powerboost.
        That one powerup is charged up just by ripping and tearing one or two fodder demons. It happens much more often than just one time.  

"He only punches shit into oblivion when he does!"  Good point. I guess.

His super advanced UAE armor helps a lot too. Samus shoots black holes okay neat, but Doom Guy has a sentinel blade and could probably turn that black hole into some crazy fodder hell portal with it. Vega would just tell him to ram the sword into it then kick it with his huge boot.

DOOM Guy doesn't play by your Smash Bros rules.
    Samus is a human-alien hybrid. She was infused with Chozo DNA and then in Fusion, Metroid DNA from that vaccine they had to give her to cure her of the X-Parasite.
    Samus = human who was buffed via alien DNA

Master Chief = human who was buffed via technology

Doomguy = human who was buffed via divine energy
        And before that just buff
    Were you there when it happened?
    No they're NOT different series! I can play as Samus and MC in Doom Eternal. You didnt know about the super secret cheat code? After you get all the regular cheats unlocked, you have to go to the main menu and press A,B,A,C,A,B,B

Then you will hear a sound saying

"GET OVER HEREEEEE"

Then you can pick them as costumes
        The funny thing is I could imagine id actually doing something like that.

The slayer is stronger than cheif tho..........
    Genetic deterioration?
        The slayer is literaly a fixed POINT in all realities in all universes in all timelines there is only 1 slayer throughout all possible time lines and realities there is ONLY 1. And hes writtwn to be the biggest immortal badass ever his 

((plot armor)) if it stands against him be it immortal or not he will find a way to kill it destroy it OR become more powerful than it to defeate it to were it is unable to cause any more harm))

Ghost Rider + DoomSlayer.         OOOOOO_OOOOOO
            I thought you were saying how if chief is the son of the slayer, why is he weaker
                If DS actually had a child that child would grow to surpass him in everyway. So I was asking if mc is the slayers son why would MC not.be the one throwing the punch O_o.   

It was just a dumb brain fart x-x
                    Perhaps the argent energy in the slayers sperm and the phazon in Samus’ egg caused microscopic super novas that caused the chief to undergo genetic deterioration?
                        Fuck it let’s go with that also I’d like to imagine those super novas just made Samus cum for hours after her and the slayer’s week long fucking.
                            Legend says that the flood was never caused by a massive storm but from a portal that leaked out the century long orgasms
                        Eh. It was a dumb brain failer.  

Tho Slayers fuel =  His infinite rage / Argent via exposure and fighting In hell for eons / Makyr Blood ((makyr magik))
                            Perhaps
                    Tell that to Zeus' children. A father always dreams their child will surpass them but it's not always the case. Even gods have flaws.
                        Shh you'll hjrt there feelings

    When a man and a woman love each other very much...
Nah master chief is adopted (canonically the slayer doesn't even know what sex is)
    Isn't it the same or similar to Goku though? He doesn't know about sex stuff?
        No Goku has had it multiple times but the Slayer has not once
            Both of our comments said "know what sex is" and "know about sex stuff", not "has had sex".
The UNSC would regret that kidnapping.
This is canon, now.
If Doom Slayer is dad, Samus must be mo/um?

Where did the name for that move come from btw
    He went over to the states for a few years and while there he named some of them after the states

        No I mean, where did All Might get the name from
            America i guess. All if his power moves are named after american states, except for that one time he said "united states smash"
            De...troit?

Like, what are you even asking bro?
            Since Detroit’s a famous US city, AM just throught it sounded cool.
Well it’s hell on earth so let’s call it canon.

In the original doom games berserk was kinda garbage.
    What? It gave you 100% health and quadrupled the damage you did with your fist for the entire level. How is that garbage?
        I mean as a berserk powerup. It feels like it’s supposed to be a short term boost but it’s actually just a health pack and brass knuckles pickup. Trying to use it like a berserk pickup from modern games just kills you since you get no defensive boosts and they tend to place it in traps. So you have to swap back to your weapons.
            Yeah, I guess if you suck it does. Get good, kid.  ;)

-Sincerely, an old timer
                I beat it on the hardest traditional difficulty. I used the berserk boost a few times for ammo preservation. But as a berserk pickup it’s awful. It’s just a melee boost and health pack, and trying to use it as a modern berserk pickup is suicide.
                    I don’t get how the original berserk pickup from any game ever could be awful. It’s literally the original. I think you just don’t know how to use it or you’re not good. I guess we’ll just have to agree to disagree.
                        If one showed up mid fight picking it up would kill me due to it swapping my weapon. The only time it was good was when the game spawns berserk and invincibility next to each other.
He was adrift for 4 years in space and found a functional planet. What kinda bs luck is that
    He always gets a nat 20 on  his luck roles.
        He got dealt some bad deals. He was kidnapped at a young age and forced through traumatizing training.

Had to watch every other spartan die, only for them to be replaced like old shoes. 

All his other "friends" also died in front of him.

And Cortana went batshit on him.


Although I dont think any of this got through to him because its stated that he displays "sociopathic tendencies"
            Tbf he just would have been glassed if he wasn't abducted, though I'm not sure which fate is worse...
                At least he was a toddler when his planet was glassed. He wouldnt know he was about to die. 



Now that I said it, that doesnt sound much better
                    The knowledge that you're about to die is what makes it bad
                        Definitely not the incinerated death part.
                    Master Chief wasn’t a toddler. By that point he was already 16 I believe
                        I could be wrong. I haven't finished the books
                        Closer to 6 than 16.
                        Correct. The Covenant didn't appear until after the Spartans complete their missions to bring down the Rebellion. I forget exactly when, but i want to say they were twenty-something when Cole took his fleet against the first Covenant ship.
            I believe the books indicate that it does affect him heavily, but he puts duty first, putting on a facade.

Halo 5 has a good moment where the rest of Blue Team talk about how Chief isn't resting and keeps going on mission after mission. He trying to not think about it.
                I played halo when I was younger and didnt understand the story and just has fun kicking alien butt.

Coming back to the series I now see that chief is a pretty depressing character.
                He has to focus on duty. It's his coping mechanism. 

If he slows down long enough to actually think about how shitty life is he would have a nervous breakdown probably.
                    And it could’ve messed him up in critical moments where he ended up saving the entire human race
            Pretty sure the doom slayer losing his rabbit was more emotionally scarring
                And being trapped in hell doing nothing but killing demons 24/7 for several millennia.
                    Eh it was a healthy anger release mechanism
                        When he was found collapsed next a wall all he could think about was killing demons. 

He is not healthy
            That's what they want you to think... Sammy and Flynn shipped him off to be a  super soldier like themselves.
                Flynn? No I choose to believe his name is William like his great granddad, that Flynn guy gets into too much crazy shit for my tastes.
                    The canon name of Doom Slayer is Flynn Taggart


Source: [lmao](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomguy)
                        He does go by a lot of different names, one of them is BJ Blazkowicz III so to hell with it, my headcanon is that his name William J Blazkowicz III.

    I always figured that Cortana is using her advanced hyper intelligence to help him pull these things off. Like she'd be pulling strings 5 days prior, or longer, to an event to make sure that it all goes well. Just because she's simulated it out a million different ways and knows what strings to pull. She would also know to limit the information she feeds to MC in order to make sure events go towards the ideal simulated result. She probably picked him as her host because she knew he would trust her long before he did. My thinking is that she guided him to the suit and sent it on the correct trajectory before they were set adrift. This plan was only feasible because she knew a planet was 4 years away.

                    Correct. The Covenant didn't appear until after the Spartans complete their missions to bring down the Rebellion. I forget exactly when, but i want to say they were twenty-something when Cole took his fleet against the first Covenant ship.
        I believe the books indicate that it does affect him heavily, but he puts duty first, putting on a facade.

Halo 5 has a good moment where the rest of Blue Team talk about how Chief isn't resting and keeps going on mission after mission. He trying to not think about it.
            I played halo when I was younger and didnt understand the story and just has fun kicking alien butt.

Coming back to the series I now see that chief is a pretty depressing character.
            He has to focus on duty. It's his coping mechanism. 

If he slows down long enough to actually think about how shitty life is he would have a nervous breakdown probably.
                And it could’ve messed him up in critical moments where he ended up saving the entire human race
        Pretty sure the doom slayer losing his rabbit was more emotionally scarring
            And being trapped in hell doing nothing but killing demons 24/7 for several millennia.
                Eh it was a healthy anger release mechanism
                    When he was found collapsed next a wall all he could think about was killing demons. 

He is not healthy
        That's what they want you to think... Sammy and Flynn shipped him off to be a  super soldier like themselves.
            Flynn? No I choose to believe his name is William like his great granddad, that Flynn guy gets into too much crazy shit for my tastes.
                The canon name of Doom Slayer is Flynn Taggart

                    He does go by a lot of different names, one of them is BJ Blazkowicz III so to hell with it, my headcanon is that his name William J Blazkowicz III.

I always figured that Cortana is using her advanced hyper intelligence to help him pull these things off. Like she'd be pulling strings 5 days prior, or longer, to an event to make sure that it all goes well. Just because she's simulated it out a million different ways and knows what strings to pull. She would also know to limit the information she feeds to MC in order to make sure events go towards the ideal simulated result. She probably picked him as her host because she knew he would trust her long before he did. My thinking is that she guided him to the suit and sent it on the correct trajectory before they were set adrift. This plan was only feasible because she knew a planet was 4 years away.

To me, a lot of the inspiration for Cortana seems to be the Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy Mk2. My personal favorite AI guide. If i'm not mistaken (i probably am) it's the FIRST AI assistant in fiction! The Mk2 was sufficiently more advanced than the original guide and only ever had one copy made. It was sort of a magical genie in how it worked. Very cool stuff. I recommend that 5 part trilogy quite a bit.  (6 now if you consider the new author's work. Yes. Still a trilogy. Deal with it!)
    In halo 3 she states she picked chief because he was "special", so your theory does have some meat on its bones
        About as much meat as a Revenant I'm afraid. It's always been my personal head canon but I don't mind if people would object to it.
    In one of the novels MC asked Cortana to calculate the correct timing for deflecting a rocket coming straight his direction. So, you're probably not wrong with her pulling the strings
        She's crazy advanced and nobody really got a chance to study her and how she works before she was deployed. Reach is where she comes online. If i remember right, she's a digital clone of her creator's mind, on top of a lot of hyper advanced processing matrixs. The only AI that was created from a living mind instead of a dead one. If that's correct then she (Cortana) has all that foundational knowledge of how to redevelop and maintain herself to avoid their kind of death. She is estimated to be 1000s of times more intelligent than a human.

Because of these posts I ended up in a Cortana rabbit hole and discovered her first words.  

>Quando il gioco è finito, il re e il pedone vanno nella stessa scatola." This phrase translates to "When the game is over, the king and the pawn go in the same box." The phrase was spoken by Halsey's mother after their first game of chess.

Right from inception she's thinking about the endgame with a sick chess metaphor. How cool is that?

AI's in HALOverse are pretty cool. They put a ton of thought into writing them.
            Yes, that's one of the reasons why i love the Halo universe
            And then she dies and comes back as a Tyrannical Bitch best on ruling the galaxy, I hate what 343 did with her character in 5.
                My theory on that is one of compromise. A fragment of her went crazy in that regard, as that's what ais in the haloverse do. Cortana was the only one that could fragment herself and rebuild afaik. My guess is due to the fact that she's a digital clone of an AI Scientist. When she sacrificed herself, I think she made fragments in as many systems as she could if i'm not mistaken.

I think that was essentially a Spock style sacrifice, where he copied himself into Bones before doing it, but her resurrection is taking place over a longer period than a low budget sequel starring Doc Brown (brownface get it?! Startrek III Search for Spock for the uninitiated)
    In one of the books, chief is being tested by some official that doesn't like Halsey's programs and wants his own to be funded. Its the first time he wears the suit and meets Cortana and the guy basically tries to kill chief.

He had to make his way past a minefield and at the end an attack helicopter (can't remember what they called it) and it shoots a missile. Cortana helps boost his own hyper advanced reflexes because he can't outrun it, he basically jumps to the side at the last second and slaps the missile away from him. It still hits the ground close to him but it was enough for him to survive
A forerunner AI named Mendicent Bias guides him there. Its explained in Halo 4 that Chief's entire existence has been planned for 100,000 years and he has been instilled with a Forerunner geas (basically artificial intuition) to do what he does throughout the series.
    I wouldnt have known that. I cant bring myself to finish halo 4. 

It's so bad
*Mendicant Bias sent him to Requiem to beat the Ur-Didact
That one powerup is charged up just by ripping and tearing one or two fodder demons. It happens much more often than just one time.  

"He only punches shit into oblivion when he does!"  Good point. I guess.

His super advanced UAE armor helps a lot too. Samus shoots black holes okay neat, but Doom Guy has a sentinel blade and could probably turn that black hole into some crazy fodder hell portal with it. Vega would just tell him to ram the sword into it then kick it with his huge boot.

DOOM Guy doesn't play by your Smash Bros rules.
And before that just buff
The funny thing is I could imagine id actually doing something like that.
My favorite code!

The slayer is literaly a fixed POINT in all realities in all universes in all timelines there is only 1 slayer throughout all possible time lines and realities there is ONLY 1. And hes writtwn to be the biggest immortal badass ever his 

((plot armor)) if it stands against him be it immortal or not he will find a way to kill it destroy it OR become more powerful than it to defeate it to were it is unable to cause any more harm))

Ghost Rider + DoomSlayer.         OOOOOO_OOOOOO
    I thought you were saying how if chief is the son of the slayer, why is he weaker
        If DS actually had a child that child would grow to surpass him in everyway. So I was asking if mc is the slayers son why would MC not.be the one throwing the punch O_o.   

It was just a dumb brain fart x-x
            Perhaps the argent energy in the slayers sperm and the phazon in Samus’ egg caused microscopic super novas that caused the chief to undergo genetic deterioration?
                Fuck it let’s go with that also I’d like to imagine those super novas just made Samus cum for hours after her and the slayer’s week long fucking.
                    Legend says that the flood was never caused by a massive storm but from a portal that leaked out the century long orgasms
                Eh. It was a dumb brain failer.  

Tho Slayers fuel =  His infinite rage / Argent via exposure and fighting In hell for eons / Makyr Blood ((makyr magik))
                    Perhaps
            Tell that to Zeus' children. A father always dreams their child will surpass them but it's not always the case. Even gods have flaws.
                Shh you'll hjrt there feelings
                    You hear that GODS?!  EVEN YOU HAVE FLAWS!!!

f the police
No Goku has had it multiple times but the Slayer has not once
    Both of our comments said "know what sex is" and "know about sex stuff", not "has had sex".
No I mean, where did All Might get the name from
    America i guess. All if his power moves are named after american states, except for that one time he said "united states smash"
    De...troit?

Like, what are you even asking bro?
    Since Detroit’s a famous US city, AM just throught it sounded cool.
Oh okay Thanks bro

I mean as a berserk powerup. It feels like it’s supposed to be a short term boost but it’s actually just a health pack and brass knuckles pickup. Trying to use it like a berserk pickup from modern games just kills you since you get no defensive boosts and they tend to place it in traps. So you have to swap back to your weapons.
    Yeah, I guess if you suck it does. Get good, kid.  ;)

-Sincerely, an old timer
        I beat it on the hardest traditional difficulty. I used the berserk boost a few times for ammo preservation. But as a berserk pickup it’s awful. It’s just a melee boost and health pack, and trying to use it as a modern berserk pickup is suicide.
            I don’t get how the original berserk pickup from any game ever could be awful. It’s literally the original. I think you just don’t know how to use it or you’re not good. I guess we’ll just have to agree to disagree.
                If one showed up mid fight picking it up would kill me due to it swapping my weapon. The only time it was good was when the game spawns berserk and invincibility next to each other.
He got dealt some bad deals. He was kidnapped at a young age and forced through traumatizing training.

Had to watch every other spartan die, only for them to be replaced like old shoes. 

All his other "friends" also died in front of him.

And Cortana went batshit on him.


Although I dont think any of this got through to him because its stated that he displays "sociopathic tendencies"
    Tbf he just would have been glassed if he wasn't abducted, though I'm not sure which fate is worse...
        At least he was a toddler when his planet was glassed. He wouldnt know he was about to die. 



Now that I said it, that doesnt sound much better
            The knowledge that you're about to die is what makes it bad
                Definitely not the incinerated death part.
            Master Chief wasn’t a toddler. By that point he was already 16 I believe
                I could be wrong. I haven't finished the books
                Closer to 6 than 16.

    Eh. It was a dumb brain failer.  

Tho Slayers fuel =  His infinite rage / Argent via exposure and fighting In hell for eons / Makyr Blood ((makyr magik))

Tell that to Zeus' children. A father always dreams their child will surpass them but it's not always the case. Even gods have flaws.
    Shh you'll hjrt there feelings

I don’t get how the original berserk pickup from any game ever could be awful. It’s literally the original. I think you just don’t know how to use it or you’re not good. I guess we’ll just have to agree to disagree.
    If one showed up mid fight picking it up would kill me due to it swapping my weapon. The only time it was good was when the game spawns berserk and invincibility next to each other.
The knowledge that you're about to die is what makes it bad
    Definitely not the incinerated death part.
Master Chief wasn’t a toddler. By that point he was already 16 I believe
    I could be wrong. I haven't finished the books
    Closer to 6 than 16.
    Correct. The Covenant didn't appear until after the Spartans complete their missions to bring down the Rebellion. I forget exactly when, but i want to say they were twenty-something when Cole took his fleet against the first Covenant ship.
And it could’ve messed him up in critical moments where he ended up saving the entire human race
Eh it was a healthy anger release mechanism
    When he was found collapsed next a wall all he could think about was killing demons. 

He is not healthy
The canon name of Doom Slayer is Flynn Taggart

    He does go by a lot of different names, one of them is BJ Blazkowicz III so to hell with it, my headcanon is that his name William J Blazkowicz III.

My theory on that is one of compromise. A fragment of her went crazy in that regard, as that's what ais in the haloverse do. Cortana was the only one that could fragment herself and rebuild afaik. My guess is due to the fact that she's a digital clone of an AI Scientist. When she sacrificed herself, I think she made fragments in as many systems as she could if i'm not mistaken.

I think that was essentially a Spock style sacrifice, where he copied himself into Bones before doing it, but her resurrection is taking place over a longer period than a low budget sequel starring Doc Brown (brownface get it?! Startrek III Search for Spock for the uninitiated)
