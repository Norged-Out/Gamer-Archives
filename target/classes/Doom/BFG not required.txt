[[BFG not required]]





That‚Äôs some fine rippin and tearin there, slayer
    Thank you
        Flair doesn't check out
            Eh, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm very good tbh
                You jumped off of the map to avoid rocket fire then SSG pulled yourself back up so you wouldn't die. I'd say you pass the sniff test.
                Ya aight.
                    HVe you sssn someone the best players on YouTube? They could do this while taking 0 damage
                        Yeah that's sweaty but you as an average this is good lmao
                        I have
                            They destroy me
                                So? Their job is to play this game, it makes sense they would pour more time and effort into this game than you. And that's okay. The way you play is beautiful, like a chorus of bullets being weaved mid game, the only limitation being the swap speed. Your movement is still pretty damn insane to watch. I'm no where near that level of skill. But that's okay. Video games were designed to relax and have fun, and that's what your doing. Your drive to improve yourself is an amazing attribute, and it personally carries me to become better at games as well, and it worked. 

TL;DR you're still amazing at this game and don't best yourself up
                What? How?
                    I made a fair amount of mistakes, almost died, and could‚Äôve killed them faster
                        What difficulty?
                            Nightmare
Holy shit
This arena (and this whole level really) is a great place to farm arbalest kills for the mastery when doing a 100% UN run. Cacos everywhere!
    This is the Mars core master level, if you do this in your un run then you have balls of steel
        Whoops didn‚Äôt realize this was the master level lol. This is some good shit my friend!

I have done all the master levels on UN with no super weapons though. Gameplay is a little sloppy tho, this was over a year ago. I‚Äôll have to do it again brought up to current lol. https://youtu.be/8FBIY-r3Cr4?si=w0fumB1yIxxg6I2O
            I think the original has only the cacodemons in the beginning 

I like to do no super weapons too, it‚Äôs pretty fun. But doing the master levels without them is brutal. I need them for the UN runs on the master levels and I‚Äôm not ashamed of that
I think the hole disappears in mars when reload this area.
    I didn‚Äôt even notice that üòÇ
The timing holy cow
    I‚Äôve been through this arena a lot let‚Äôs just say that
        Bro, thanks for sharing that was fantastically entertaining
The back glory kill on the Hell Knight, splitting its torso apart is just SICK. ü§üüèΩü§üüèΩü§üüèΩ

Also, in the beginning when you meat hook all those caco‚Äôs one after another while remaining in the air, reminds me of Asuka Langley vs the Eva Series.
    I wish I could‚Äôve gotten all 5 back to back there‚Äôs just too many üòÇ
        Try using the faster glory kill rune, along with the longer stagger one. That should give you enough time to kill all those meatballs.
            I used to explicitly use that rune, now I switch it out for equipment fiend as I was doing my UN run and I kept using it for these more insane arenas
I can see my guy‚Äôs hatred toward them demons. I can felt his pleasure of tearing them apart.
You are one sick bastard.
Man i miss playing doom no other game can scratch the itch this game can
    I've played many games that are amazing these few years, but every few months i just have to boot up doom eternal and run through a master level. It just never gets boring.
    Start playing it again
        I should, just wish theyd make another one
Now do no crucible at the end of Tara‚Äôs nbad nightmare.
    Light work
frankly the grenade gulp on cacos is OP and has always been OP, especially paired with super shotgun meathook, but boy is it fun to use.
    Cannot beat a guaranteed glory kill, literally saved my run here, twice. 

They also act as excellent meathook points for aerial mobility
Is this what it's like to be good at the game? 

That's awesome dude great job
I liked how you went inside that little hall with all of them cacos following you üòÇ nice gameplay my guy
    I was able to get through once without the shield, I used the mobile turret to chew through the cacodemons but I‚Äôm getting this footage I just couldn‚Äôt get through that part without hiding in there with the shield‚Ä¶ so be it
clickbait i saw you fire the bfg
    Ssshhhh‚Ä¶.don‚Äôt tell anyone
I did this the first few times because I thought it was only gonna give 1 BFG ammo so I wanted to ‚Äúsave it for a bigger fight‚Äù


It respawns after you pick it up
    That happened to me the first time I played the normal arc complex üòÇ
Wow
Could have just used the ballista.
    I prefer the glory kills and I don‚Äôt like waiting for the ballista to recharge with so many cacodemons, and I needed to save the ammo for the destroyer blade for the hell knights
        Mastery gives you instant load when hit the target. Splash damage can put the cocos in glory kill stagger. Nail two, let the splash do the rest
            I saw that, but I could never get it to work right. That or I must not be paying attention. Even if I land a hit I still have to charge the next shot, but it‚Äôs probably because I‚Äôm not reacting fast enough. 

Anyways, I prefer using the sticky bombs because not only is it fast but it‚Äôs pretty fun to arc the perfect shot into their mouth
                Are you holding down M2? It resets if you release it.
                    I dont know, if all happens so fast, but Im Pretty sure I release it after each shot
                        Yeah, the only way to take advantage of the mastery is holding down the weapon mod button.
Jesus fucking Christ. This dude gotta be the real doom slayer
    I wish I was that good
Chaining Cacos is one of my fav things
Jesus Christ.
Cacodemon glories are one of if not the most satisfying kills in this game.

# I WILL RIP, TEAR, AND DIE ON THIS HILL.
This is nuts goddamn is a good slaughter fun to watch
It‚Äôs not a requirement, it‚Äôs an accessory
HOW DO YOU EVEN UNLOCK MASTER LEVELS
    Finish the campaign equivalent of the level. ARC complex, Taras Nabad, Super Gore Nest and Mars Core, as well as the World Spear in TAG2.

Except for Cultist Base, you need the rip and tear pack to play that so it's technically paid DLC.
        Of course. So that's why I can't play it.
To quote Nuclear Throne:

Glad to see I wasn't the only person who did the whole fight then realized I should have just used the BFG cell in the middle rather than hoarding them...
lol I love how you waste the BFG shot at the end for the lulz üòÇ
this spot on brawler mode is pain. no balista, no bfg and no sticky bombs. i got past it by sheer luck
    Why you playing Master Levels in Brawler Mode?
        i enjoy suffering
Did the same thing first time, didn't even see the bfg argent
Don't worry I am 2 steps behind as I did this part of the Master Level without BFG because I didn't know the Charge in the center refills itself and I was saving it for later...
Now try console
    I‚Äôm not strong enough
This might be the single best gaming video that I have ever seen
I've always tried to do this but never could; great work Slayer! üéÉ
    You‚Äôll get there
Why do people think not using super weapons is out of this world lol.
    It‚Äôs a bit of fun skill expression.
    They don‚Äôt
    Not having to use the BFG shows mastery of the combat loop ;p It almost feels like a "give up" button depending on how high up your skill is.
[deleted]
    Your mom knows that all too well
Reject ammunition return to chainsaw!!!
Imagine they do this with a stone face and relaxed
So basically BFG is required unless you‚Äôre a god?
    No, you don‚Äôt need to be a god to withhold the BFG
This reminds me of how awesome an actual infinite horde mode would have been, rather than the Horde Mode we actually got
    I‚Äôm honestly not a huge fan of infinite wave horde modes. Things like nazi zombies. I love zombies, but it just gets boring. It will inevitably become boring and you‚Äôll get worn out. I like that there is real progression and a win condition. In my opinion it just is more satisfying. Any infinite mode is doomed to get tedious to the point you stop voluntarily and it disincentivizes you from playing again in the future. That‚Äôs just my opinion though. 

What I don‚Äôt like about the horde mode we got was how absurdly arcadey it is. At times it‚Äôs just so over the top it‚Äôs grating. The challenge sections and coin stuff and challenge rounds, it got old my second play through and I groan everytime I have to do it. The arenas are incredible through. They are fucking nuts, especially the later ones. I think I ended up dying 3-4 times across a play through. 

Overall though I‚Äôm pretty happy with horde mode.
        Well Nazi Zombies infinite horde mode isnt comparable to what an infinite Doom Eternal Horde mode would be, because in Doom you have a ton of different enemies the game can chuck at you while in COD theres not really too many different zombies (afaik, i havent played it but from what i know there arent really different zombies), and, well, Doom is Doom. Its ALWAYS gonna be fun to tear through hordes of demons while seeing how long you can last. No 1 UPs, BFG ammo and Crucible charges are rare, so you really have to use your regular weapons to kill tons of Superheavies when you hit 30+ waves. A semi-proof of concept is Ultrakills Cybergrind. Ultrakill is in that way similar to Doom in that they are both hyper-fast paced Movement FPS shooters, and Ultrakills infinite Horde mode is AWESOME, as you fight more and more stronger enemies while having to get creative with your movement to dodge them all.

And you saying that the later Arenas are incredible, imagine how overwhelming they would be if it just kept going and you eventuall had to fight 3 Doom Hunters, an Archvile and a Dozen of various heavy demons with no BFG shots left
This kind of stuff is what helps you get better for master levels
    This is a master level
Pretty dang good! Makes me feel like I could never do this lol
    You can
Seriously impressive.  You cleared that with little to no real effort.
    Trust me, I was using 100% of my brain
        Maybe that's my problem. I'm using the part of my brain that is designated specifically for demon slaying, but the rest of my brain is basically an empty elevator complete with lame music.
            Me too man, me too
        No thoughts. Only

#RAGE
Highly entertaining
Impressive
Fuckin' sick performance!
The Destroyer Blade works wonders too if you can set it up.
    I slept on it for far too long
        To be fair it is kind of suicide to use it without a jump pad in Nightmare. That's why I prefer UV.
            Yeah charging it up in the air is how i use it exclusively now
Lore accurate Doom Guy
    I wish
Wonder if doomguy does anything with the caco eyes
