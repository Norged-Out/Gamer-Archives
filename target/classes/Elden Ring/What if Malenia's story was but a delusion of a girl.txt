[[What if Malenia's story was but a delusion of a girl]]





Tf did I just read...
    [deleted]
        So many times they had to write her out of the lore to justify not beating her
            Genuinely made me laugh, thanks! xD
        What knowing defeat does to a mf 😔

    The truth maidenless!!! That's what you read!!!
    Barely comprehensible, I’m going to give the benefit of the doubt and say OP’s first language is not English

            Whatever you say boss

Edit: maybe you need to take some writing composition classes, the slide with Ranni doesn’t even make sense from the previous slide, General should be capitalized, there’s more

Also, I said barely *comprehensible*, which means understandable, that’s a lot different than text that is clearly *legible*, which means someone is able to *read* it.

I could read it just fine, it just barely made any sense

                    Reread my comment and the edit, legible is not the word you even mean, furthering my supposition that English isn’t your first language or you’re not as smart as you think you are
                        Yeah It didn’t make any fucking sense this guy is just salty
    Fanfiction.
    Sounds like bedtime story from thousands of years before the game
You mean to tell me that amount of spanking in her boss chamber was delusion?
    "Huh, what's with all the clapping in malenias room?" "Oh, new guy just showed up"
        lmao
        He's clapping her cheeks?

No,she's clapping his.
    Therapist: MOo0stafa doesn't exist. 
He can't spank you Malenia.
        Why did you assume that she is the one being spanked tho?
            Right lol
            Probably because of his hentai addiction.
                Those who have tasted the forbidden elixir alone cast accusations upon those entangled in similar indiscretions.
        AS IF MALENIA WOULD BE THE ONE GETTING THEIR ASS KICKED
            Her
                what?
                    Her ass kicked
                        their isn't exclusively used for lgbt people, it's just a gender neutral way to refer to someone. I didn't use it because I thought Malenia was non-binary
                            There is nothing to do with lgbt. You just use "their" if you don't know if someone is a man or a woman, but we know Malenia is a woman, so no point in "their". It's just english, not lgbt.
                                Their is gender-neutral, you don't use it for the sole reason of not knowing someone's gender. You can also use it for things that were previously mentioned.
                                    "used to refer to a generic or unspecified person previously mentioned, about to be mentioned, or present in the immediate context): Someone left their book on the table. A parent should read to their child."

My point was you use it for something unfamiliar in that context, but we know she's a she. Well, we did. You said you thought she was non-binary.


>you don't use it for the sole reason of not knowing someone's gender

That was obviously an example.
            FACTS
            Let Me Solo Her
    So all I had to do was see a doctor instead of yelling at my TV?
    you wanna try and fight a delusional hobo
OP got his ass kicked so hard he made a fanfic to cope

Holy shit
    Not only that. In the fanfic he made Malenia delusional and weak. That’s usually how malenia leaves her enemies.
        OP is Godrick.
            Honestly, I think you're doing Godrick dirty, not even he would be *this* pathetic
            "OP is Godrick"

Tbh I found this comment quite hilarious. This means I like it as a humor.
                Indeed, I too have this "taste" in this humor you speak of, quite tasteful.
    💀
Me when my body was cut into 1k pieces by the the dance: YEAH THAT CANT BE REAL
    reminds me of the "ornstein from ds1 was an illusion" theory.
        Well, he is an illusion. But it doesn't he can't hurt us..

Edit: doesn't mean
        Thats not a theory, thats true. He's in ds2
            and dead in ds3 lol
    Maybe it's the Matrix telling you that you have been cut up into 1k Pieces.
is malenia in the room with us right now?
    I hope she is so she can give OP the whooping he needs
This guy definitely draws hentai, or he is just really lazy and a bra and panties are easier to draw




Edit: wait no, all the other characters in the comic have clothes, ok the artists draws hentai AND has a thing for malenia
    Yeah it's a touching and sad story but why is she naked :/
        Wretches start the game in their underwear.
            So does that mean they're naked forever for all time then or......
                Umm Elden ring no hit challenge speedrun(Español)
        Playing devil's advocate he called her a wretch which if you pick that starting class your character is basically naked. But also as devil's advocate its not a strong arguement and OP should probably still go to horny jail.
        Very *touching* 😏 (forgive me I am afflicted with madness)
            AAAAAAAAAhhhhhAaaAAAAAAAaa
*gasping for air*
   #AAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHGAAASAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHaaaaaHHHHHH
                Average madness reaction
        Me when I hit phase two for the first time.
            LOL
        I just assumed it was cuz she's poor and drawing her completely naked (because she's too poor for cloths) would've completely detracted from the story entirely.

Could've been better tho, maybe some rags that fell halfway down her belly and a makeshift skirt made of a ragged piece of cloth that barely reached her knees, would probably get the point across better.
            You mean could have been worse? Because your example stinks even more than ops
                Not according to public opinion
        It reads as shallow to me, matched with the needless nudity it's a miss.
        The most charitable interpretation would be that the author is kind of going for an "emperor's new clothes" thing for Malenia's wardrobe to go with the whole delusion angle.

At the same time, there is quite a bit speaking against it and that angle wouldn't really work since the emperor in the story was dressed that way due to having deluded himself in his extreme vanity.

There is actually quite a bit of interesting symbolism with Malenia and her clothes in the game. They are kind of treated as her chrysalis and only once she abandons them (and the shame human society associates with lack of clothes) does she unleash her full power as the "Rot Goddess".

That aside, in this case it's most likely to assume that OP is just very fond of Malenia being half naked, which does distract quite a bit from the story they are trying to tell.
            It is more like "The Little Match Girl" I think, imaginary family and dying to rot/cold and all that. Of course it has nothing to do with nudity, just talking about general story elements.
        Because we are commenting on the thread of a weird, lonely boy.
        If you’re blind, why wear clothes? 🤔
        Cause she is naked in her boss-fight obviously
    Lmfao dude already has hentai-radar
    Wretch dude, wretch.
    I drew her that way bc she's a wretch
        I read that in my mind with such conviction
        I mean fair but like- could have still covered her in rags or tatters or something?
            Lowkey why doesn’t the wretch start with rags?
                Because the wretched aren’t allowed to have clothes.
        A wretch with prosthetic legs but no clothes? Man, just say you're horny.
        And you gave her big tits because…?
            Those aren’t big tits though.
            [removed]
                Buddy, the first two things in your post history are Sellen age regression art and Emma from Sekiro stripping. I simply do not believe you when you say that this isn't sexual.
                    Jesus christ
                I would’ve kept this comment to myself. 

“I swear it’s not sexual! I would’ve drawn her tits freakishly huge if it were sexual!”
                Oda, is that you? 😂
                Honey…go ahead and pull up her in-game character model again. You made her chest like three times bigger.
                If you had no sexual intentions in this comic then you have fallen victim to the latent perversion and mysogony of Anime. Take badass strong lady and supply tearjerker alt story that reduces her power, places her below everyone else, and gives opportunity for closeups on a literal fucking g-string panty and bra outfit. Anime classic. Work on yourself man...
                    Based comment. OP undeniably has problems with how they view women and their comment shows a considerable lack of self-awareness for someone who has enough motivation to draw as well (being generous here) as they do.
                        Hopefully they come to understand it as they grow older. They're likely only teenage atm
                    Lmao at the downvotes. Victims of anime brain poisoning
                    How can you type this out without a hint of shame?
                        Because I'm not wrong, OP has a fucked up view of women, and every downvote I get is from people like OP?
                            You’re absolutely not wrong
                    Well to be fair that only happens in the most dogshit of harem anime
                        It happens in some degree in almost every Anime, including otherwise fantastic ones. The only anime I can think of that doesn't do it is OG Ghost in the Shell
        nothing against your art man, it's spectacular but in my opinion you could've made her look more like she's using rags as a dress, like Ymir's design from attack on titan.

Elden Ring is based on a medieval european setting with nordic influence (giant life tree, valhalla, valkyries) and in both settings the wrenchs use rags instead of only underwear, and even if you took inspiration from the literal wrench class, lore-wise it's not like they used to always dress like that while walking the streets of TLB.

anyways it's an amazing comic but it looks like fan-service kinda ruined it (even if it wasn't your intention)
        This felt personal. I approve.
    Thank u for this comment. I got so confused and was like, was that how Malenia dressed? Have I not touched the Elden Ring in too long?
    OP's post history is kind of a fever dream for sure :I
    Well the story does start off establishing she was a "wretch", and panties+tubetop is the official uniform of the wretch starting class for female characters. Still more clothing than she wears in phase 2 (unless prosthetic limbs count as clothes)
    checked their history...yup
    My immediate thought upon seeing the first couple pages. 100% there’s some more inappropriate drawings that they kept to themself.
    It's almost like she actually wears that shit or something.
Gotta be honest: I've never been a fan of the "what if this story was a dream all along?" trope or fan theory because it can be applied to literally anything and most often takes away more from a story than it adds.
    This is also just insulting to Malenia and all the lore surrounding her and pretty much contradicts everything the game has established in the name of "what if Malenia was a delicate nekkid anime waifu"
        Plus a dash of jerking off to Radahn.  They are always weirds and cringes.
        OP is literally just Maleigh Marais irl lmao
    Not to even mention how her story is about being strong despite one's handicaps, and in this, they make her extremely weak **because** of her disabilities.
    You shouldn’t be a fan of it, it’s hack writing. Lazy and soulless.
    yeah this is just like the creepypasta of what if the cartoon character is actually mental patient type of thing
> "She imagined herself to be equal to the Mightiest demigod General Radahn"

Yeah, and I just *imagined* the dozens of ass whoppings she gave me too. Totally never happened. I'm the best.
so who tf wiped my ass 50 times then
    Just 50?💀
And the true Malenia was Millicent all along
    Malenia is like the Dalai Lama. When the previous one finishes rotting away, Gowry goes back out to the swamp to coax out some Scarlet Valkyries to replace her. 

That's why there's an extra set of maiden's clothes next to that bloom outside Malenia's boss room.
        Wasn't millicent born in Aeonia? Like her and her sisters budded after Malenia cooked Caelid?
            Pretty sure yeah. Malenia pollinated (?) all of the sacramental buds and that's where all the rot children came from. 

So when Cleanrot Knight Finlay carried "Malenia's body" back to the Haligtree, it wasn't her actual corpse, but another one of those rot children. 

So there was the Malenia that fought Radahn that nuked Caelid, however many Malenias in between, and then Millicent is set to be the next one.
                Is this an actual idea that's presented in the lore or just fun speculation? I like it either way and it sounds cool but I'm curious.
                    It is speculation at best. No where does it come close to saying Melania dies and gets replaced by these “rot children”
                    It's fairly established in the game. Gowry speaks of having found Millicent and her sistsers as babies in the Swamp of Aeonia.

Then there's the fact Millicent also suffers from scarlet rot, shares parts of Malenia's memories to the point of knowing where she is, and is capable of performing waterfowl dance despite never having met her Malenia.

Malenia birthed the Scarlet Aeonia in Caelid and from that flower Millicent and her sisters were birthed. Gowry decribes them as daughters of Malenia, but I honestly think it's more apt to call them clones even if they're not a 1:1.
                        Maybe it would be more apt to thing of them like a fungus since it's considered an extant form of life. Malenia is the core and Millicent and her sisters are her spores.
                            Yeah, I think that's a more accurate description.
                            Man, stop. I don't want to start another playthrough just to check one thing, again.
                    Speculation. I just think it fits better than the lore as it's presented.

Why else would Gowry be so obsessed with creating Scarlet Valkyries? Despite the horrible stuff he puts them through, he seems to genuinely care about each one.

We know Malenia isn't eternal either. She's had to rely on Miquella to cure her before, which is one of the reasons she continues to wait for him.

Also, decay is an extant form of life. It exists in both life and death, so it makes sense if the goddess of rot would do the same.
                        I agree with your comment and I do find it hilarious that Malenia can essentially reproduce like a fungus.
                            Reproduce like a fungus, evolve like a pokemon. She's basically a vileplume.
                                Malenia is a Pokémon confirmed
What the fuck
wtf is this
    OP's been huffing some copium.
imagine being so salty that malenia kicked your ass you scribble an entire comic that basically acts as a big "NUH UH"
The hell is this? A Tumblr fanfic?
    As a member of the ER tumblr community, I think tumblr would hate this actually
        “Hi, man here, what if Malenia, the warrior demigoddess, was actually a stupid, weak, delusional sexy big tiddy baby woman with her same fancy articulated  f e e t  prosthetics but no clothesies”


Thousands of 20 year old Tumblr lesbians: 🔪🔪🔪
            Exactly lmao
        Then must be a Twitter tier fanfic
    You think a platform dominated by women who have been unfairly scorned in regards to their porn content are going to like this? No, this is r34 fanfic.
Never seen such a brain rotting and smoth Brain level of coping and revenge porn for being pegged too many times
what if this really cool and strong woman was a child and had huge tits. and also she’s super weak and doesnt wear any clothes
    And all of her canonical heroism and victories are just her maladaptive daydreaming to cope with being a homeless leper
        pretty incel-pilled of op
Early 2000s cartoon conspiracy theory type shit
What if elden ring is just a hallucination had by Tony Soprano while watching his kids play Legend of Zelda. 
I also can string words together.
    Reading this thread makes me feel old lol. These kinds of 'theories' became quite popular around mid - late 2000s, particularly the Ash Ketchum coma theory. Then they died down once people realized they weren't really that compelling aside from the initial shock factor. Guess we've come full circle.
        another one was what if the rugrats all died and the show was all in angelica's head

&#x200B;

I dunno, what if? Does it add anything? Cause if it adds something, cool!

But *does* it?
        [deleted]
            Oh I agree. You can make a similar theory for pretty much any fictional character ever. They rarely add anything interesting beyond being somewhat plausible by default. You can't prove that a story *isn't* just a given character's delusion after all.
    What if Tony Soprano's kids were actually made of pudding and no one knew because Tony never tried eating them with a spoon and he's insane and stuff
        Wow! That would be so sad and profoundly deep. Way better than the already existing story we’ve co-opted with our dumb additions.
    What if the Tarnished is actually in a coma, and the events of Elden Ring were just a dying dream? Man wouldn't that suck?!

These theories are pointless precisely because the events ARE FICTIONAL. So if we ask "What if it's all fake?" The answer is always going to be "Well, it is"

It adds nothing, it wastes time, and it's baby's first theory.
    Her brother Miquella, whatever happened there.
    STOP MAKING ME THINK THINGS!!!! STOOOOOOOOP!

&#x200B;

AHHHHH.
So cringe fan fics are getting up voted here now? Man this sub is desperate for content.
    Yeah a few more weeks before the DLC gets shown at TGA Copium
        Few more weeks... nah bro, i wish ;_;
What a terrible day to be literate.
This is the wierdest take I've heard so far. And imo it's a real stretch
So who the fuck did I die 50 times to in the Haligtree?
    Soldier that explodes. 😎
What if my grandmother had handlebars? Then should would have been a bicycle.
Yeah, I've also read the Ash Ketchum theory.
    explain?

Edit: Don't know why I'm being downvoted but okay I guess
        It's that Ash has just been in a coma for the entire anime
            Jesus that's sad
                All 'theories' like this are sad. Beyond that, there's nothing remotely compelling about them.
Then Elden Ring would have been 3 hours shorter for me
Why is she in a bikini
    Ik might of survived the winter with actual clothes
I got my ass beat by this person way too much for it to be the delusions of anybody
Why have you done this
Way to infantilize (*and* fetishize) one of the story’s most *canonically* powerful (*disabled!*) women. God forbid we have *anything* in this house.
    >> See’s a kickass female character

Redditor: What if we replace the kickass with uwu?
    Especially since she has a great rune, kicks our ass, transforms into the rot goddess before our very eyes in which she sprouts wings and starts *fucking flying* and leaves behind a scarlet bloom.

She is also canonically confirmed to be an Empyrean. Ranni ain't making shit up out of pity for people.
        *Literally* in the flavor text that it should’ve been or could’ve been *the* most sacred rune! Queen.
    I thought she was gonna become the malenia we know by the end of this
        Yeah, imagine that she's some random girl delusionally believing she's Miquella's twin and trained by the blue dancer, but, because she is as powerful a warrior as she claims to be, people start to believe her deluded claims, and the Outer God of Rot takes notice of her and names her its Empyrean, thinking it's taking revenge by corrupting the apprentice of the warrior that locked it away.
            This right here is *infinitely* more narratively compelling and respectful to her character than OP’s comic.
    Agreed. 

This comic is honestly cringe.
        Seeing all the "this made me cry" comments had me going "Yeah no this made me cringe".

My first thought was, why is she basically naked in dainty lingerie for any reason other than for creepy ass fanservice. Her head is also disproportionately large. A wretch wouldn't be living in the Capital.

If she was some delusional nobody, who would have gone through the time and effort of making advanced prosthetics too?
            It really is buck wild how many ppl look at this type of shit and think “awww how cute~” w/out *any* further consideration of context. Truly the barest surface-level reading comp.
                Also this is a personal thing but I hate this art style because it makes Malenia look like a bobble headed teenager as opposed to a graceful, powerful woman.
                    Weebs and incels like their ladies physically “well-developed” but mentally schoolchildren.
                        Which I don't think we need explain why that's just fucking gross.
        I can even *defend* cringe! More ppl should be openly cringe. But this is just grody. “Oooo if only the Lands’ baddest motherfucker was a squishable anime doll instead.”
        It really is.
    I think Miquella is also not a thing here? So there’s that.
        You’re so fucking right.

“Remember that *other* crazy-powerful disabled god who ppl like to fetishize? Yeah he’s just gone! Poof!”
            Remember, the only disabled god who is allowed to be cool is Radahn because he learned ride to horse his gravity magic.
                True. I mean, I like fanfiction and headcanons and all that, but this felt like one long, drawn out comic to ride Radahn's fictional rotted shaft by putting Malenia down tbh
                    The venn diagram of “ppl deifying Radahn as some gigachad” and “ppl who objectify and disparage Malenia” is a circle.
                Morgott and Mohg are both super cool though?
            Honestly, my guess is he died a child. “Eternal child” after all. In this case it’s because he died a child. But yeah. Kinda boring story. Too many “it was all a dream” vibes.
            God damn have y'all not heard of fanfic or separate canons?
                What’s it like having *near-zero* critical thinking and literary analysis? It must be *wild.*
                    Why don't you let me know.
                        See *that* was actually clever! So you *aren’t* stupid, just bad-faith. Fantastic.
            Literally all of the demigods and shard bearers have some sort of disability.  In fact Miquella is the least disabled; he doesn’t age sure but has a normal body (or did before getting Mohg’d but that’s a whole other can of worms).
                If you met a human being irl who had a condition that held them hostage in the body of a child I can reckon they might disagree about how disabling it is, champ.
                    You conveniently failed to address the main point but go off, king.
                        Queen*
                In the present, sure, but for many of them their 'disability' is either self-inflicted and/or didn't affect them before The Shattering. Radahn didn't start losing his mind till the fight with Malenia, Rykard was  able of body and mind till he fed himself to a giant Snake, and Ranni slew her own body to escape control of The Fingers. Mohg and Morgott probably qualify, being born as Omens, and Malenia and Miquella also have been afflicted for their entire lives. To that end, if we're counting recently acquired afflictions, I'd say Miquella's soul/consciousness being MIA qualifies at least as much as Radahn's.

 "Least disabled" is kind of a hard argument to make, even ignoring how contentious a prospect it is to rank types of disabilities by 'difficulty'. Mohg and Morgott are physically and mentally capable individuals, they experience nightmares and torment from their condition but their suffering is seemingly just as much a property of being mistreated by the Golden Order. Meanwhile I'm not sure whether being merged to an immortal snake God really counts as a disability or anything comparable. Likewise for Ranni, being a puppet doesn't stop her from doing what she wants to do with her life, and her original body was perfectly functional, but subject to control by someone else. Miquella had to undergo a physical transformation to fulfill his goal of becoming a God.
    I think this captures my negativity towards it fairly succinctly. Malenia’s a fucking nuke that deserves her status as super-boss (even if the fight is bullshit). This whole idea that she’s just some innocent little girl with a dreams completely misses the point of Malenia.

Malenia isn’t some frail thing in skimpy clothing. Malenia is HER. And she’s real keen on you remembering that.
    I believe it’s a reimagining, not saying that’s what happened. And OP clarified that the lack of clothing was to portray her as a wretch.
        ok but then why is she wearing like pristine modern lingerie instead of tattered rags? Slide 8 is some Victoria's Secret shit.
            Also almost exactly what the Wretch class wears, seen [Here](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/file/Elden-Ring/wretch_class_elden_ring_wiki_guide_270px.png) and before you say that this one is more wrinkled, as nice as OP’s art style is, it’s not very detailed.
        A rose by any other name
    Chill mate, this comic is just a fun concept. It'd be no different if they made the comment about a crazy senile  grandpa godfrey type comic
        No *mate,* it wouldn’t actually!🙂 I am *literally* addressing the sexism re: why this shit happens to certain characters and not others.
            Agree to disagree, I think if someone's taking this comic seriously enough to think it's being sexist or to think Malenia is actually weak then they're kidding themself.
    Imagine not being able to accept the idea of sad stories with no good ending.

As someone who is a fan of the many different Canons in the SCP universe I can enjoy a story where my favorite characters who I've known to be strong or smart are completely incapable no matter how much they try or wish things to be different because it allows a different perspective on the character. (Sorry for the only somewhat related tangent)

And because sad stories are simply quite enjoyable and if it was just a story about a random wretch it would certainly be sad but seeing one of the strongest be torn down as such is much sadder because we know what she was, what she could be and yet she doesn't get there.
        >”Imagine not being able to accept the idea of sad stories w/ no good ending.”

This is *not* what we’re talking about here dude and you *know* it lmao. I *refuse* to believe that you’re *actually* this dense.

*Log off.*
            Bro forgot this was the soulsborne fandom and good endings dont really exist that much 💀
            You say that while completely ignoring that I mentioned your point in a later part of the response, aand whether you believe so or not that is partially what you're talking about.

You can't accept that someone took one of the strongest characters in Elden Ring lore and "infantilized" her which was literally just them making a sad story of her, word it how you like but that's what you're upset about.
                I’m done arguing w/ a wooden post.
    [removed]
        Never see this treatment of the *other* major Shattering players, even tho they’re all war crims too. Wonder why… (jk we all know why)
        Radahn deserves the massive nerf then if we’re going by your logic
God FORBID a woman is strong and capable in a video game
    OP after losing to Malenia for the 78th time. “I diagnose her with…… delusions, leprosy, no clothes, pity from her neighbors, and death from cold weather.”
    Not how it was meant, I would assume
    Just saying, I'd still draw Malenia naked and weak even if she was a man.
        You seem like the type to draw yourself as the ugly bastard in your middling hentai.
            Guy is about to write Rent-A-Maiden lmao
        We all know that's not true.
Thanks I hate it
Wtf did I just read. This is bad and you should feel bad.
feels like the story is more about the delusion of the players by now 

please take a rest and go outside for a while
o nein cringe
Spellcheck will also pick up on grammatical errors. But, like, we know for a fact that her story wasn't a delusion so is this just a "fun" thought experiment? Otherwise it's got that lazy connotation of "What if Ash died episode 1 and all of Pokemon is a dying hallucination?"
If she’s kicking your ass so badly that you’re making UwU web comics, just summon your Mimic and lie about it dude. Good god.
In my opinion, the “what if it was all a dream/tragic delusion??” is the single most creatively bankrupt, universally applicable, and ultimately meaningless angle to take on a story. It basically never does much besides cheapening the original work and turning it into an empty waste of time. 

I don’t like this comic, but my opinion shouldn’t prevent anyone who does from doing so. Keep creating for the people who like your work.
    I appreciate your attitude. It was the most gentle and effective way to display your opinion without causing any argument.
        Your fanfiction is shit lol. What happened? Malenia kick your ass 1 too many times so you decided to write a whole ass fanfic about her being naked, delusional and weak? Im so glad your getting utterly roasted in these comments lol, because this post is genuinely pathetic. 

You gonna write “rent a maiden” next?
            Bro it's just a cringy fanfic calm down
            The upvotes on OP's post begs to differ. You might not like it but his take on malenia x the little match girl is fitting for the upcoming season and a breath of fresh air from whatever repetitive memes and content is being posted on this sub.
Having fought her, her abilities with a blade are certainly no delusion.
Sure didn’t feel like a delusion when she was kicking my ass
Ugh
Never cook again
Lik dis if U cry evertim
    Keep scroling if u hate ur maiden!1!1
Why is Malenia almost naked
    Cause op likely draws hentai
    Cuz horny
This is so bad how does it have so many upvotes.
Starting to be really concerned about the amount of people who refer to Malenia, a grown ass woman, as a little girl
Classic anime/hentai move. Badass super strong demigod woman gets turned into a cute pitiable puppy with no threatening power at all.
Is this “Malenia” in the room with us now?
Then who the fuck slaughtered me repeatedly for 4 hours straight under that Haligtree?
What is this lame, anti-glurge cul de sac purgatory snowglobe character assassination bullshit
    purgatory snowglobe lmao
    Those were certainly words. Almost a sentence, in fact.
        And this was almost a good comic
    what
There’s so much wrong with this but “Mightiest Demigod” being RADAHN made me laugh so hard lmfao
Coincidentally*
It’s not
Godrick, is that you posting?
"What if Malenia's story was but a delusion of a girl"-mf's when the hardest boss in the game 2-shots them:
Wait a minute, what happened to the cleanrot knight (Finlay?)  that carried her across the snowfields. How we forgetting
    Finlay was the name of the merchant who told her stories, the only one to look after her before being confined below the capital with most of his clan, leaving her alone with the sole memory of his tales and him bringing her home on his shoulders in the cold winter days before.
    If everything that she achieved was nothing but a delusion, perhaps the Existence of Finlay is a reflection of her need for an affection when she's most desperate.
        "It's a delusion" is some weak ass days of our lives shit
        Is Caelid being nuked also a delusion of hers or what
Welp off to dunk my head in sulfuric acid.
Somebody couldn’t beat Malenia
Didn't know radahn could draw
......you bastard made me cry
this is just millicent
Why is Malenia always in her underwears ?
    > Once upon a time, a *wretch* named Malenia

She wears the Wretch starting equipment and lacks the means to improve upon it.
        I don't think the wretch starting equipment is a pristine lacy thong.
            That's what I'm saying, like slide 8 is literally a modern side-lacing bikini bottom ffs
    [deleted]
        Here tho it’s bc the artist wishes she was a naive and pitiable anime girl instead of an actual literal god.
            The OP specifically states it was to portray her as a wretch
                And *I’m* specifically stating that’s gross.🙂
                    Fair, but still, I’m just saying it probably wasn’t a fetish thing.
                        Oh my brother in christ it for *sure* is a fetish thing. Three things in life are certain: death, taxes, and horny dudes on the internet disempowering canonically powerful women into something more demure and fuckable.
                            It could be a fetish thing but I really don’t think that’s what is happening. This isn’t saying this is what Melania should have been, it’s a reimagining of her horrifically tragic story, with her just losing her godliness. She’s already fucked up in the head when you fight her. This isn’t trying to make her more fuckable, and she was always pitiable (having to rot away for her whole life, and losing her brother, who was literally a saint, to the creepy child predator that lives in the underworld) and just making it a different kind of pitiable. She is a better character without this retelling of the story, having her live a tragic life, losing her brother, rotting her whole life, existence shunned by the rest of the demigods, and in the biggest battle of her life, loses, only to be later meeting the same end as Radahn when the Tarnished kills her. Much better character with her original story. Or maybe I’m just to far into NNN to pay attention to horny things, I don’t really know. But again, probably not a fetish thing.
                                I’m not bothering to read this brick just bc you can’t see two feet in front of your face dude.

“She’s *just* losing her godliness,” “this *could* be a fetish thing but I just don’t see it,” what a world you must live in.

(Bonus round: you’re doing NNN, I’m in awe)
                                    Yeah sorry not everyone is as pessimistic as you and immediately assumes the worst intentions. OP literally stated the actual reason, but you’re not even saying “maybe” you’re saying that it is “for sure” a fetish thing because why again? Projecting? I don’t like the “it was all a dream” thing personally, but I’m still not gonna shit all over someone’s fan fiction comic they went out of their way to share with people, and certainly not going to shit on their character based on so little. But you on the other hand have just gone out of your way to be an ass all over this post’s comments, to OP and pretty much anyone else I’ve seen you interact with who doesn’t assume the worst.
                                    It’s NNN so maybe I’ve just become immune to horny things. But read the brick.
Caelid just called and wants to know who the fuck nuked it then
    Next level war crime denial
    Obviously an inside job, Radahn just wanted to prove how much an absolute chad he was so he ordered a rot nuke to be dropped directly on him.
Wtf why would you do that!?
Marika’s tits
    You must be ungy
Downvoted
Can you people just start your own Malenia perv sub or something?
I like it, but I have two pieces of criticism:

1) Why is it segmented over so many slides? Just compile each set of 4 of them into a slide. 

2) The grammar.
    1) I'll try to apply them next time

2) Eng isn't my main language so I reinforce with translator and  ask my mates living in the states.

Any feedbacks are appreciated!
        If your translator let this slide, you need to get a new one.
This sounds like something Ranni would tell you. I mean she claimed to not know what caused the shattering
Is this some sort of fetish? This has to be a fetish right?
    Almost definitely. OP's other artistic endeavors include Sellen getting age regressed by a misfired spell and Emma the Gentle Blade presenting her hindquarters, and knowing that plus the weird need a lot of male ER fans have to degrade Malenia, I find it hard to interpret this as anything other than OP's barely-disguised fetish
It's overall good art. But even if not intentional it is unnecessarily sexualized. It seems like you're hardwired to draw women very sexual at any time, like mentioned in other comments, which isn't a bad thing, but can be rather tone deaf if the context doesn't fit. Also, there are a few spelling and grammar errors that make some panels really hard to figure out what kind of story you are telling, with such a serious and emotional story, I reccomend proffreading it twice and let somebody else do too. If English isn't your native language, let that person be an english native or somebody with a degree in English. Maybe not what you want to hear and I'm prepared to catch many downvotes since it's been too many times I tried giving constructive criticism and got downvotes to hell, but it's really only meant as advice to elevate your work. There's talent in there, there really is, it just needs to be refined in a few aspects.

Edit: I misremembered how the Wretch outfit looked like, my point still stands though.
    Look at this guy's post history, it was 100% intentionally sexualized
        Well, okay, I guess, idk. Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to call him out on being a perv or something, it is still waaaaay too tame for that, and in the right context, there isn't actually anything wrong with that as well. I'm just saying that in context of a more serious story, it might do good to tone it down just a bit. As someone who does love watching anime, seeing an anime character having a serious moment and then having a skimpy outfit or exaggerated body features just doesn't do justice to the intended tone. I must admit, as an artist myself, I too struggled to draw outside the boundary of my original style, failing to match my character's visual tone with what I was trying to convey with the tone of the story. It's a hard thing to do, so intentional or not, I think it is a good thing to consider as an artist that your comfort style should change if you tell a different story with your drawings than you usually do, if that makes any sense.
    And I'd humbly accept it! No matter the type, a support is a support. You've wrote these letters just for me! How could I get mad?
If that's true then her delusions can absolutely throw hands.
    And nuked an entire continent
Yup and all those deaths were just a delusion too, couldn’t have possibly died that many times to one boss…
What ?
Maybe this wouldn't seem so demented if you had written it in your first language
That is the kind of nightmare you get when you sleep in an uncomfortable chair.
How do I delete someone else’s post?
What if you’d never drawn or posted this?
This is bad and you should feel bad op
What if the moon was your car and Jupiter was your hair brush
What if the entire plot of Elden Ring is just a dream? And you wake up in the back of a horse drawn carriage with other prisoners, on your way to get executed for crimes against the Empire. And just as you’re about to be beheaded, a dragon-
Why
Hentai Malenia has thot rot, her tall tales originate from the syphilis induced psychosis
    Thot rot lmao. I'll remember that
Mothafucka I was going to sleep not cry....
This is a beautiful imagination. The role of rot in her reality or dreams would also be an interesting addition.
Totally bullshit, everybody whoul have taker her in their home
    OP presents a blind, defenseless girl in her underwear just laying in the middle of a *medieval* city and expects us to believe that leprosy by itself would lead all of the men to just watch on with sad faces and go about their days.
This is pretty damn fucked up
Then who the fuck kicked my ass like a billion times? specifically remember that bitch saying her name was Malenia.
Erza Scarlet is that you?
Then one day she died :(
New take of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Match_Girl .. but.. I suspect her to be this maiden https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Shield+of+the+Guilty .. so maybe..
Sucker Punch. If the rest of you were like me and couldn’t put your finger on what movie this was, it was Sucker Punch. Thanks Google.
Nah I'm pretty sure that the 60 or so times that she kicked my ass are pretty real...
The comic confuses her for Miliscent. It's okay, it happens.
What the fuck?
This is the story of a girl....
THIS IIIS A STORY OF A GIRL!
Don't quit your day job OP
Lay off the copium, pal.
She really traumatized you.
"And then malenia died" lmao cope
Go outside.
Apparently almost nobody in this comment section understands what a “what if” scenario is, Jesus.
When you get your ass beat so bad by a woman you have no choice but to write a sad girl uwu fanfic about her 😔
Very strange comment section. OP is just making art that pertains to a "what-if" scenario. It's obviously all fun and games. 

Yet, there are comments everywhere thinking this individual made this piece because they're salty they can't beat Malenia? Why and how did so many of the top comments come to that conclusion? 

Why does the souls community have to inject their "get good" attitude even in pieces of art?
That makes literally 0 sense game lore-wise, but cool drawings
I can't stop thinking of Radahn hunched over a desk with a pencil held between two fingers drawing this.
My intuition says that OP here had a dream where Malenia was just a normal girl, but then he woke up, all disappointed and resentful that Malenia is still in the game crushing his foolish ambitions to rest. 10/10 the copium was of premium quality
brother cant even conceptualize grass at this point
She look like erza from fairy tail
Look what Malenia did to Godrick the Golden.

Now on his knees telling delusional stories to people, begging for mercy!
So the Haligtree would be like the Hunter's Nightmare. No wonder the Albinaurics struggled to find the place.
    This is a good bloodbourn reference 💯
op definitely spends a lot of time yelling about "Mary Sues."
    I get the feeling that OP is one of the people who hasn't gotten a good night's sleep since Captain Marvel came out
That was absolute horse shit, well done on trying to ruin an amazingly written character.
That would actually be a great game, playing as a wanderer who finds these children dying and dreaming of greatness and the boss fights are you talking to them as they die and they dream of a great warrior facing them in battle... granting them comfort in their final moments
    So bioshock but a souls game
        I don't remember that being what Bioshock is about... I think it's more like Sinner which is an interesting game but incredibly hard because of the unique level system
            I meant the helping little sisters
That's so sad what the hell

It's so tragic
Dogshit stupid theory because Caelid AND Radahn  are both visibly FUCKED from the scarlet rot born of malenia.

I’m all for fan theory’s but please apply this thing you have called a brain and make one that actually works / fits in with the lore
    Bro, Does everything you read here supposed to be a theory? OP's post is clearly tagged as Fan Art and as others stated has this What if or little match girl vibe.  There was a fan art posted here a while back of a Artorias and Malenia clashing. Does that mean there's a theory that they actually really fought in the lore? How about the Official elden ring gag manga, Did you take that seriously too?
        The art is one thing - the captions on each panel however tell a fan theory. Did you read them? That’s what my comment is directed at not the weird kawaii hentai Malenia
Seems like this was written by someone with a 6th grade education. Maybe ESL? Very hard to follow this nonsense. “Coinsidentally” threw me off for a good minute.
Skill issue, maybe just don’t lose lmao
What.
Makes sense as an explanation to why Waterfowl Dance is such an anime bs move
Because the world of Elden Ring wasn't quite sad enough already...

The only issue I have with this particular canon is that she is *awfully stabby* for a dead girl...
that delusional girl has killed billions of people world wide.
oh, boys... bless your heart OP.
    I'm good. I Thank for your support though!
Life is happier when you look away from hatred.
Then a naked pothead enters the chat…
We need a wholesome darksouls sub.
Goddamnit thats actually sad as hell
I know you just didn't pull a Little Match Girl on me. How dare you make me have feelings.
i almost had pitie, then i remembered the time she made me spend and this fucking tree, she aint no lil' girl, neither her story is delusional, she maybe a warrior, but SHE IS DEAD FOR SURE! BITCH!
Poison Swamp cancer and empyrean bs asides, i wonder how tf one of the mightiest demigods, completely able to hold the freaking stars with his gravity magic, got his ass handed by a basically limbless girl with a sharp stick
People talking about how this OP is horny, y'all do know wretches in Elden ring don't wear clothes right? And before anyone goes "well why'd they make her a wretch?", wretches make the most sense to be delusional
    check their history lol
        Okay nvm, but my point still stands for this specific post. Wretches don't wear clothing and are the most believable for a delusional character
Don’t care, let me solo her.
    thats the spirit!
Cute little comic, but all the pain is real. No need to hide from it, just kick her ass.
This was depressing... But I liked it overall.
So did Radahn just randomly contract scarlet rot?
then how'd she beat my ass 87 times in a row?
This is weird, and feels like a para social relationship with a video game character
You're really talented.

On an unrelated note: I hate you.

On another unrelated note: take my upvote.
This would be really sad. The Malenia we fought was a projection of the ideal Malenia. Once we defeated the ideal Malenia, we discover the true Malenia; a powerless and weak girl.
probably a better ending than what she got
    Like dying in a decisive battle against a naked hobo with two swords who's also wearing a pot on his head?
Hmm, this was an odd read, but the art style was very cute.
That was kinda a neat read. Nice work!
Bruh this is so well done.
But why you gotta make me sad a day before Thanksgiving!?
I feel like some of the people commenting are struggling with the idea of fanfic.
    You can write fanfic, but people in that fandom won't always find it interesting or compelling. Write a John Wick fanfic where John is actually some loser who fantasized all his movies while watching Taken on repeat, and fans of John Wick probably won't care much for it.
        I'm mostly mentioning the few comments I saw of people saying stuff like "This isn't canon" or "But Malenia did beat Radahn" because they just legitimately seem confused about what this post is.
    It's not GOOD fanfic though.
        I'm mostly mentioning the few comments I saw of people saying stuff like "This isn't canon" or "But Malenia did beat Radahn" because they just legitimately seem confused about what this post is.
    It's the world we're living... where people are demanding what's right and wrong.
Nice
Elden rugrats
Melania fucking dies
Dann this made me sad
Apparently women can’t be powerful only delusional and dead
Malenia IS delusional, because no sane person goes up to a naked man wielding a comically large hammer (the body was never found)
Hahaha enjoyed your drawing bro
That’s actually wholesome/bittersweet af
Oh no, empowered girls are scawwy and hit hard, better make a fanfiction to put them in place.
-OP, maybe, idk
Whoever drew this is amazing. Bless the Erdtree for this one ❤️
U mf

Now i m sadge
Thats a thick malenia ..😅
Goddamnit, the story's already as sad as it is. Why'd you have to ubercharge tf out of it OP?
Based delulu
"I am melania, blade of miquella, and I have never known defe-"

(The common cold apears)

"OH SHIT"
This is cool but it still don’t change the fact that she’s kind of a bad person.
This story would probably make me feel something if I didn’t despise her as a being. Very egotistical and mean. She deserves no happy endings and only a slow death
    Tell me you didn't pay attention to the lore without telling me.
    Least biased Radhan chud
        I don’t give a hoot about radahn either tbh. Now show me some smough lore and you’ll have my full attention
    Haha right, she nuked like a quarter of the continent
I just checked your account and some of your posts are criminally underrated!
    >I just checked your account and some of your posts are criminal

Got that right
    Oh hell to the fuck nah
        Am I missing something? It’s mostly souls art, a couple of cosplays and memes. What part of it is so bad?
VAT???
What if it was a delusion that bled into reality?
Madness
You know in all souls games there's power rooted in faith.
it would be pretty cool if the demi-goddess Malenia was in some way conceived by the spread of the tale of a wretched girl...
:(
Idk why but I was expecting her to find a behilit in the snow
Maybe miquella made her dream come true?
YEAH NOW I DON'T HAVE TO KILL ANOTHER GINGER, GOD DID IT HIMSELF
Thought this was a r34 of the red head chick from Faury Tail anime
???
The real story is the friends we make on the journey
10 years later, when OP is 18...he will be using AI to churn out the god level bullshit art and novels that even cringe content will cringe at.
let me solo her is a right dick on this version
What the?
This is almost as bad as when NighGlow9 comments on things 😭
Did Godrick make this?
Godrick can draw?
Wouldn't this mean all my hardwork to beat this bitch isn't real nahh every ass whopping I got was no dream
Where's Boc when you need him?
…what?
So why do we fight her?
This one’s Sanity must have already crumbled…
the art is good but this is just “what if they were in a coma the whole time” but changed a bit so
This is an attempt to genjutsu Malenia out of existence hahaha
Bro what ??
Wat?
If she’s dreaming than Tiche must be the alarm clock
Delusions got hands with how she beat tf outta me 💀
If the delusion can be hellishly strong like that, the pitiers should f themselves now.
This feels like this was dug out of Radahn’s subconscious, delusional, rot-blighted dreams after aeonia-caused brain damage in a bad way.
Me struggling for days to kill her didn't seem like a delusion.
I don’t get it…
this is the result of a chemical reaction composed of seethium and copium
Damn people are taking this way too seriously and being overly mean in the comments lol. OP history aside I thought of it as just a harmless interpretation and not intended to drag on the canon but just spin a what-if, even if a rather generic and edgy one.
OP just rewrote Malenia lore to justify not beating her
Bro put his sword down and picked up a pen 💀
Coinsidentally is when you find change in the couch of the exact amount you need for a tip
Obviously fake, Radahn wasnt with his horse
i have two questions

1. why is this nsfw?
2. is this supposed to be a theory or something? because if so it doesn’t make sense because she definitely isnt some random blind girl with a stick when she is that hard to defeat, and she for sure isnt dead
Love this, idk why all the hate. F the haters and keep doing your art.
This is nsfw? 😂
Denial stage of grief from losing the boss fight.
I cried reading that...
... Pardon?
Delete this for your own sake, tbh.
Reminds me of that story of a young girl who had to go out and beg people for money for Christmas and who died because of the cold and the fact that everyone ignored her
There's still time to delete this
This is super bizarre

That was beautiful
This is special... :3
is this godrick propoganda
What…
Why?
But like shes in the game
what kind of dumb shit do people like this lick?? is this furries and people who jerk off to cartoons?
Bro I know she's hard but this is too far :(
[deleted]
    So many times they had to write her out of the lore to justify not beating her
        Genuinely made me laugh, thanks! xD

        Whatever you say boss

Edit: maybe you need to take some writing composition classes, the slide with Ranni doesn’t even make sense from the previous slide, General should be capitalized, there’s more

Also, I said barely *comprehensible*, which means understandable, that’s a lot different than text that is clearly *legible*, which means someone is able to *read* it.

I could read it just fine, it just barely made any sense

Fanfiction.
Sounds like bedtime story from thousands of years before the game
"Huh, what's with all the clapping in malenias room?" "Oh, new guy just showed up"
    lmao
    He's clapping her cheeks?

No,she's clapping his.
Therapist: MOo0stafa doesn't exist. 
He can't spank you Malenia.
    Why did you assume that she is the one being spanked tho?
        Right lol
        Probably because of his hentai addiction.
            Those who have tasted the forbidden elixir alone cast accusations upon those entangled in similar indiscretions.
    AS IF MALENIA WOULD BE THE ONE GETTING THEIR ASS KICKED
        Her
            what?
                Her ass kicked
                    their isn't exclusively used for lgbt people, it's just a gender neutral way to refer to someone. I didn't use it because I thought Malenia was non-binary
                        There is nothing to do with lgbt. You just use "their" if you don't know if someone is a man or a woman, but we know Malenia is a woman, so no point in "their". It's just english, not lgbt.
                            Their is gender-neutral, you don't use it for the sole reason of not knowing someone's gender. You can also use it for things that were previously mentioned.
                                "used to refer to a generic or unspecified person previously mentioned, about to be mentioned, or present in the immediate context): Someone left their book on the table. A parent should read to their child."

My point was you use it for something unfamiliar in that context, but we know she's a she. Well, we did. You said you thought she was non-binary.


>you don't use it for the sole reason of not knowing someone's gender

That was obviously an example.

Not only that. In the fanfic he made Malenia delusional and weak. That’s usually how malenia leaves her enemies.
    OP is Godrick.
        Honestly, I think you're doing Godrick dirty, not even he would be *this* pathetic
        "OP is Godrick"

Tbh I found this comment quite hilarious. This means I like it as a humor.
            Indeed, I too have this "taste" in this humor you speak of, quite tasteful.
💀
reminds me of the "ornstein from ds1 was an illusion" theory.
    Well, he is an illusion. But it doesn't he can't hurt us..

Edit: doesn't mean
    Thats not a theory, thats true. He's in ds2
        and dead in ds3 lol
Maybe it's the Matrix telling you that you have been cut up into 1k Pieces.
I hope she is so she can give OP the whooping he needs
Yeah it's a touching and sad story but why is she naked :/
    Wretches start the game in their underwear.
        So does that mean they're naked forever for all time then or......
            Umm Elden ring no hit challenge speedrun(Español)
    Playing devil's advocate he called her a wretch which if you pick that starting class your character is basically naked. But also as devil's advocate its not a strong arguement and OP should probably still go to horny jail.
    Very *touching* 😏 (forgive me I am afflicted with madness)
        AAAAAAAAAhhhhhAaaAAAAAAAaa
*gasping for air*
   #AAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHGAAASAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHaaaaaHHHHHH
            Average madness reaction
    Me when I hit phase two for the first time.
        LOL
    I just assumed it was cuz she's poor and drawing her completely naked (because she's too poor for cloths) would've completely detracted from the story entirely.

Could've been better tho, maybe some rags that fell halfway down her belly and a makeshift skirt made of a ragged piece of cloth that barely reached her knees, would probably get the point across better.
        You mean could have been worse? Because your example stinks even more than ops
            Not according to public opinion
    It reads as shallow to me, matched with the needless nudity it's a miss.
    The most charitable interpretation would be that the author is kind of going for an "emperor's new clothes" thing for Malenia's wardrobe to go with the whole delusion angle.

At the same time, there is quite a bit speaking against it and that angle wouldn't really work since the emperor in the story was dressed that way due to having deluded himself in his extreme vanity.

There is actually quite a bit of interesting symbolism with Malenia and her clothes in the game. They are kind of treated as her chrysalis and only once she abandons them (and the shame human society associates with lack of clothes) does she unleash her full power as the "Rot Goddess".

That aside, in this case it's most likely to assume that OP is just very fond of Malenia being half naked, which does distract quite a bit from the story they are trying to tell.
        It is more like "The Little Match Girl" I think, imaginary family and dying to rot/cold and all that. Of course it has nothing to do with nudity, just talking about general story elements.
    Because we are commenting on the thread of a weird, lonely boy.
    If you’re blind, why wear clothes? 🤔
    Cause she is naked in her boss-fight obviously
Lmfao dude already has hentai-radar
Wretch dude, wretch.
I drew her that way bc she's a wretch
    I read that in my mind with such conviction
    I mean fair but like- could have still covered her in rags or tatters or something?
        Lowkey why doesn’t the wretch start with rags?
            Because the wretched aren’t allowed to have clothes.
    A wretch with prosthetic legs but no clothes? Man, just say you're horny.
    And you gave her big tits because…?
        Those aren’t big tits though.
        [removed]
            Buddy, the first two things in your post history are Sellen age regression art and Emma from Sekiro stripping. I simply do not believe you when you say that this isn't sexual.
                Jesus christ
            I would’ve kept this comment to myself. 

“I swear it’s not sexual! I would’ve drawn her tits freakishly huge if it were sexual!”
            Oda, is that you? 😂
            Honey…go ahead and pull up her in-game character model again. You made her chest like three times bigger.
            If you had no sexual intentions in this comic then you have fallen victim to the latent perversion and mysogony of Anime. Take badass strong lady and supply tearjerker alt story that reduces her power, places her below everyone else, and gives opportunity for closeups on a literal fucking g-string panty and bra outfit. Anime classic. Work on yourself man...
                Based comment. OP undeniably has problems with how they view women and their comment shows a considerable lack of self-awareness for someone who has enough motivation to draw as well (being generous here) as they do.
                    Hopefully they come to understand it as they grow older. They're likely only teenage atm
                Lmao at the downvotes. Victims of anime brain poisoning
                How can you type this out without a hint of shame?
                    Because I'm not wrong, OP has a fucked up view of women, and every downvote I get is from people like OP?
                        You’re absolutely not wrong
                Well to be fair that only happens in the most dogshit of harem anime
                    It happens in some degree in almost every Anime, including otherwise fantastic ones. The only anime I can think of that doesn't do it is OG Ghost in the Shell
    nothing against your art man, it's spectacular but in my opinion you could've made her look more like she's using rags as a dress, like Ymir's design from attack on titan.

Elden Ring is based on a medieval european setting with nordic influence (giant life tree, valhalla, valkyries) and in both settings the wrenchs use rags instead of only underwear, and even if you took inspiration from the literal wrench class, lore-wise it's not like they used to always dress like that while walking the streets of TLB.

anyways it's an amazing comic but it looks like fan-service kinda ruined it (even if it wasn't your intention)
    This felt personal. I approve.
Thank u for this comment. I got so confused and was like, was that how Malenia dressed? Have I not touched the Elden Ring in too long?
OP's post history is kind of a fever dream for sure :I
Well the story does start off establishing she was a "wretch", and panties+tubetop is the official uniform of the wretch starting class for female characters. Still more clothing than she wears in phase 2 (unless prosthetic limbs count as clothes)
checked their history...yup
My immediate thought upon seeing the first couple pages. 100% there’s some more inappropriate drawings that they kept to themself.
It's almost like she actually wears that shit or something.
This is also just insulting to Malenia and all the lore surrounding her and pretty much contradicts everything the game has established in the name of "what if Malenia was a delicate nekkid anime waifu"
    Plus a dash of jerking off to Radahn.  They are always weirds and cringes.
    OP is literally just Maleigh Marais irl lmao
Not to even mention how her story is about being strong despite one's handicaps, and in this, they make her extremely weak **because** of her disabilities.
You shouldn’t be a fan of it, it’s hack writing. Lazy and soulless.
yeah this is just like the creepypasta of what if the cartoon character is actually mental patient type of thing
Just 50?💀
Malenia is like the Dalai Lama. When the previous one finishes rotting away, Gowry goes back out to the swamp to coax out some Scarlet Valkyries to replace her. 

That's why there's an extra set of maiden's clothes next to that bloom outside Malenia's boss room.
    Wasn't millicent born in Aeonia? Like her and her sisters budded after Malenia cooked Caelid?
        Pretty sure yeah. Malenia pollinated (?) all of the sacramental buds and that's where all the rot children came from. 

So when Cleanrot Knight Finlay carried "Malenia's body" back to the Haligtree, it wasn't her actual corpse, but another one of those rot children. 

So there was the Malenia that fought Radahn that nuked Caelid, however many Malenias in between, and then Millicent is set to be the next one.
            Is this an actual idea that's presented in the lore or just fun speculation? I like it either way and it sounds cool but I'm curious.
                It is speculation at best. No where does it come close to saying Melania dies and gets replaced by these “rot children”
                It's fairly established in the game. Gowry speaks of having found Millicent and her sistsers as babies in the Swamp of Aeonia.

Then there's the fact Millicent also suffers from scarlet rot, shares parts of Malenia's memories to the point of knowing where she is, and is capable of performing waterfowl dance despite never having met her Malenia.

Malenia birthed the Scarlet Aeonia in Caelid and from that flower Millicent and her sisters were birthed. Gowry decribes them as daughters of Malenia, but I honestly think it's more apt to call them clones even if they're not a 1:1.
                    Maybe it would be more apt to thing of them like a fungus since it's considered an extant form of life. Malenia is the core and Millicent and her sisters are her spores.
                        Yeah, I think that's a more accurate description.
                        Man, stop. I don't want to start another playthrough just to check one thing, again.
                Speculation. I just think it fits better than the lore as it's presented.

Why else would Gowry be so obsessed with creating Scarlet Valkyries? Despite the horrible stuff he puts them through, he seems to genuinely care about each one.

We know Malenia isn't eternal either. She's had to rely on Miquella to cure her before, which is one of the reasons she continues to wait for him.

Also, decay is an extant form of life. It exists in both life and death, so it makes sense if the goddess of rot would do the same.
                    I agree with your comment and I do find it hilarious that Malenia can essentially reproduce like a fungus.
                        Reproduce like a fungus, evolve like a pokemon. She's basically a vileplume.
                            Malenia is a Pokémon confirmed
OP's been huffing some copium.
As a member of the ER tumblr community, I think tumblr would hate this actually
    “Hi, man here, what if Malenia, the warrior demigoddess, was actually a stupid, weak, delusional sexy big tiddy baby woman with her same fancy articulated  f e e t  prosthetics but no clothesies”


Thousands of 20 year old Tumblr lesbians: 🔪🔪🔪
        Exactly lmao
    Then must be a Twitter tier fanfic
You think a platform dominated by women who have been unfairly scorned in regards to their porn content are going to like this? No, this is r34 fanfic.
And all of her canonical heroism and victories are just her maladaptive daydreaming to cope with being a homeless leper
    pretty incel-pilled of op
Reading this thread makes me feel old lol. These kinds of 'theories' became quite popular around mid - late 2000s, particularly the Ash Ketchum coma theory. Then they died down once people realized they weren't really that compelling aside from the initial shock factor. Guess we've come full circle.
    another one was what if the rugrats all died and the show was all in angelica's head

&#x200B;

I dunno, what if? Does it add anything? Cause if it adds something, cool!

But *does* it?
    [deleted]
        Oh I agree. You can make a similar theory for pretty much any fictional character ever. They rarely add anything interesting beyond being somewhat plausible by default. You can't prove that a story *isn't* just a given character's delusion after all.
What if Tony Soprano's kids were actually made of pudding and no one knew because Tony never tried eating them with a spoon and he's insane and stuff
    Wow! That would be so sad and profoundly deep. Way better than the already existing story we’ve co-opted with our dumb additions.
What if the Tarnished is actually in a coma, and the events of Elden Ring were just a dying dream? Man wouldn't that suck?!

These theories are pointless precisely because the events ARE FICTIONAL. So if we ask "What if it's all fake?" The answer is always going to be "Well, it is"

It adds nothing, it wastes time, and it's baby's first theory.
Her brother Miquella, whatever happened there.
STOP MAKING ME THINK THINGS!!!! STOOOOOOOOP!

&#x200B;

AHHHHH.
Yeah a few more weeks before the DLC gets shown at TGA Copium
    Few more weeks... nah bro, i wish ;_;
Soldier that explodes. 😎
explain?

Edit: Don't know why I'm being downvoted but okay I guess
    It's that Ash has just been in a coma for the entire anime
        Jesus that's sad
            All 'theories' like this are sad. Beyond that, there's nothing remotely compelling about them.
Ik might of survived the winter with actual clothes
>> See’s a kickass female character

Redditor: What if we replace the kickass with uwu?
Especially since she has a great rune, kicks our ass, transforms into the rot goddess before our very eyes in which she sprouts wings and starts *fucking flying* and leaves behind a scarlet bloom.

She is also canonically confirmed to be an Empyrean. Ranni ain't making shit up out of pity for people.
    *Literally* in the flavor text that it should’ve been or could’ve been *the* most sacred rune! Queen.
I thought she was gonna become the malenia we know by the end of this
    Yeah, imagine that she's some random girl delusionally believing she's Miquella's twin and trained by the blue dancer, but, because she is as powerful a warrior as she claims to be, people start to believe her deluded claims, and the Outer God of Rot takes notice of her and names her its Empyrean, thinking it's taking revenge by corrupting the apprentice of the warrior that locked it away.
        This right here is *infinitely* more narratively compelling and respectful to her character than OP’s comic.
Agreed. 

This comic is honestly cringe.
    Seeing all the "this made me cry" comments had me going "Yeah no this made me cringe".

My first thought was, why is she basically naked in dainty lingerie for any reason other than for creepy ass fanservice. Her head is also disproportionately large. A wretch wouldn't be living in the Capital.

If she was some delusional nobody, who would have gone through the time and effort of making advanced prosthetics too?
        It really is buck wild how many ppl look at this type of shit and think “awww how cute~” w/out *any* further consideration of context. Truly the barest surface-level reading comp.
            Also this is a personal thing but I hate this art style because it makes Malenia look like a bobble headed teenager as opposed to a graceful, powerful woman.
                Weebs and incels like their ladies physically “well-developed” but mentally schoolchildren.
                    Which I don't think we need explain why that's just fucking gross.
    I can even *defend* cringe! More ppl should be openly cringe. But this is just grody. “Oooo if only the Lands’ baddest motherfucker was a squishable anime doll instead.”
    It really is.
I think Miquella is also not a thing here? So there’s that.
    You’re so fucking right.

“Remember that *other* crazy-powerful disabled god who ppl like to fetishize? Yeah he’s just gone! Poof!”
        Remember, the only disabled god who is allowed to be cool is Radahn because he learned ride to horse his gravity magic.
            True. I mean, I like fanfiction and headcanons and all that, but this felt like one long, drawn out comic to ride Radahn's fictional rotted shaft by putting Malenia down tbh
                The venn diagram of “ppl deifying Radahn as some gigachad” and “ppl who objectify and disparage Malenia” is a circle.
            Morgott and Mohg are both super cool though?
        Honestly, my guess is he died a child. “Eternal child” after all. In this case it’s because he died a child. But yeah. Kinda boring story. Too many “it was all a dream” vibes.
        God damn have y'all not heard of fanfic or separate canons?
            What’s it like having *near-zero* critical thinking and literary analysis? It must be *wild.*
                Why don't you let me know.
                    See *that* was actually clever! So you *aren’t* stupid, just bad-faith. Fantastic.
        Literally all of the demigods and shard bearers have some sort of disability.  In fact Miquella is the least disabled; he doesn’t age sure but has a normal body (or did before getting Mohg’d but that’s a whole other can of worms).
            If you met a human being irl who had a condition that held them hostage in the body of a child I can reckon they might disagree about how disabling it is, champ.
                You conveniently failed to address the main point but go off, king.
                    Queen*
            In the present, sure, but for many of them their 'disability' is either self-inflicted and/or didn't affect them before The Shattering. Radahn didn't start losing his mind till the fight with Malenia, Rykard was  able of body and mind till he fed himself to a giant Snake, and Ranni slew her own body to escape control of The Fingers. Mohg and Morgott probably qualify, being born as Omens, and Malenia and Miquella also have been afflicted for their entire lives. To that end, if we're counting recently acquired afflictions, I'd say Miquella's soul/consciousness being MIA qualifies at least as much as Radahn's.

 "Least disabled" is kind of a hard argument to make, even ignoring how contentious a prospect it is to rank types of disabilities by 'difficulty'. Mohg and Morgott are physically and mentally capable individuals, they experience nightmares and torment from their condition but their suffering is seemingly just as much a property of being mistreated by the Golden Order. Meanwhile I'm not sure whether being merged to an immortal snake God really counts as a disability or anything comparable. Likewise for Ranni, being a puppet doesn't stop her from doing what she wants to do with her life, and her original body was perfectly functional, but subject to control by someone else. Miquella had to undergo a physical transformation to fulfill his goal of becoming a God.
I think this captures my negativity towards it fairly succinctly. Malenia’s a fucking nuke that deserves her status as super-boss (even if the fight is bullshit). This whole idea that she’s just some innocent little girl with a dreams completely misses the point of Malenia.

Malenia isn’t some frail thing in skimpy clothing. Malenia is HER. And she’s real keen on you remembering that.
I believe it’s a reimagining, not saying that’s what happened. And OP clarified that the lack of clothing was to portray her as a wretch.
    ok but then why is she wearing like pristine modern lingerie instead of tattered rags? Slide 8 is some Victoria's Secret shit.
        Also almost exactly what the Wretch class wears, seen [Here](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/file/Elden-Ring/wretch_class_elden_ring_wiki_guide_270px.png) and before you say that this one is more wrinkled, as nice as OP’s art style is, it’s not very detailed.
    A rose by any other name
Chill mate, this comic is just a fun concept. It'd be no different if they made the comment about a crazy senile  grandpa godfrey type comic
    No *mate,* it wouldn’t actually!🙂 I am *literally* addressing the sexism re: why this shit happens to certain characters and not others.
        Agree to disagree, I think if someone's taking this comic seriously enough to think it's being sexist or to think Malenia is actually weak then they're kidding themself.
Imagine not being able to accept the idea of sad stories with no good ending.

As someone who is a fan of the many different Canons in the SCP universe I can enjoy a story where my favorite characters who I've known to be strong or smart are completely incapable no matter how much they try or wish things to be different because it allows a different perspective on the character. (Sorry for the only somewhat related tangent)

And because sad stories are simply quite enjoyable and if it was just a story about a random wretch it would certainly be sad but seeing one of the strongest be torn down as such is much sadder because we know what she was, what she could be and yet she doesn't get there.
    >”Imagine not being able to accept the idea of sad stories w/ no good ending.”

This is *not* what we’re talking about here dude and you *know* it lmao. I *refuse* to believe that you’re *actually* this dense.

*Log off.*
        Bro forgot this was the soulsborne fandom and good endings dont really exist that much 💀
        You say that while completely ignoring that I mentioned your point in a later part of the response, aand whether you believe so or not that is partially what you're talking about.

You can't accept that someone took one of the strongest characters in Elden Ring lore and "infantilized" her which was literally just them making a sad story of her, word it how you like but that's what you're upset about.
            I’m done arguing w/ a wooden post.
[removed]
    Never see this treatment of the *other* major Shattering players, even tho they’re all war crims too. Wonder why… (jk we all know why)
    Radahn deserves the massive nerf then if we’re going by your logic
OP after losing to Malenia for the 78th time. “I diagnose her with…… delusions, leprosy, no clothes, pity from her neighbors, and death from cold weather.”
Not how it was meant, I would assume
Just saying, I'd still draw Malenia naked and weak even if she was a man.
    You seem like the type to draw yourself as the ugly bastard in your middling hentai.
        Guy is about to write Rent-A-Maiden lmao
    We all know that's not true.
I appreciate your attitude. It was the most gentle and effective way to display your opinion without causing any argument.
    Your fanfiction is shit lol. What happened? Malenia kick your ass 1 too many times so you decided to write a whole ass fanfic about her being naked, delusional and weak? Im so glad your getting utterly roasted in these comments lol, because this post is genuinely pathetic. 

You gonna write “rent a maiden” next?
        Bro it's just a cringy fanfic calm down
        The upvotes on OP's post begs to differ. You might not like it but his take on malenia x the little match girl is fitting for the upcoming season and a breath of fresh air from whatever repetitive memes and content is being posted on this sub.
Keep scroling if u hate ur maiden!1!1
Cause op likely draws hentai
Cuz horny
purgatory snowglobe lmao
Those were certainly words. Almost a sentence, in fact.
    And this was almost a good comic
what
Finlay was the name of the merchant who told her stories, the only one to look after her before being confined below the capital with most of his clan, leaving her alone with the sole memory of his tales and him bringing her home on his shoulders in the cold winter days before.
If everything that she achieved was nothing but a delusion, perhaps the Existence of Finlay is a reflection of her need for an affection when she's most desperate.
    "It's a delusion" is some weak ass days of our lives shit
    Is Caelid being nuked also a delusion of hers or what
> Once upon a time, a *wretch* named Malenia

She wears the Wretch starting equipment and lacks the means to improve upon it.
    I don't think the wretch starting equipment is a pristine lacy thong.
        That's what I'm saying, like slide 8 is literally a modern side-lacing bikini bottom ffs
[deleted]
    Here tho it’s bc the artist wishes she was a naive and pitiable anime girl instead of an actual literal god.
        The OP specifically states it was to portray her as a wretch
            And *I’m* specifically stating that’s gross.🙂
                Fair, but still, I’m just saying it probably wasn’t a fetish thing.
                    Oh my brother in christ it for *sure* is a fetish thing. Three things in life are certain: death, taxes, and horny dudes on the internet disempowering canonically powerful women into something more demure and fuckable.
                        It could be a fetish thing but I really don’t think that’s what is happening. This isn’t saying this is what Melania should have been, it’s a reimagining of her horrifically tragic story, with her just losing her godliness. She’s already fucked up in the head when you fight her. This isn’t trying to make her more fuckable, and she was always pitiable (having to rot away for her whole life, and losing her brother, who was literally a saint, to the creepy child predator that lives in the underworld) and just making it a different kind of pitiable. She is a better character without this retelling of the story, having her live a tragic life, losing her brother, rotting her whole life, existence shunned by the rest of the demigods, and in the biggest battle of her life, loses, only to be later meeting the same end as Radahn when the Tarnished kills her. Much better character with her original story. Or maybe I’m just to far into NNN to pay attention to horny things, I don’t really know. But again, probably not a fetish thing.
                            I’m not bothering to read this brick just bc you can’t see two feet in front of your face dude.

“She’s *just* losing her godliness,” “this *could* be a fetish thing but I just don’t see it,” what a world you must live in.

(Bonus round: you’re doing NNN, I’m in awe)
                                Yeah sorry not everyone is as pessimistic as you and immediately assumes the worst intentions. OP literally stated the actual reason, but you’re not even saying “maybe” you’re saying that it is “for sure” a fetish thing because why again? Projecting? I don’t like the “it was all a dream” thing personally, but I’m still not gonna shit all over someone’s fan fiction comic they went out of their way to share with people, and certainly not going to shit on their character based on so little. But you on the other hand have just gone out of your way to be an ass all over this post’s comments, to OP and pretty much anyone else I’ve seen you interact with who doesn’t assume the worst.
                                It’s NNN so maybe I’ve just become immune to horny things. But read the brick.
Next level war crime denial
Obviously an inside job, Radahn just wanted to prove how much an absolute chad he was so he ordered a rot nuke to be dropped directly on him.
You must be ungy
1) I'll try to apply them next time

2) Eng isn't my main language so I reinforce with translator and  ask my mates living in the states.

Any feedbacks are appreciated!
    If your translator let this slide, you need to get a new one.
Almost definitely. OP's other artistic endeavors include Sellen getting age regressed by a misfired spell and Emma the Gentle Blade presenting her hindquarters, and knowing that plus the weird need a lot of male ER fans have to degrade Malenia, I find it hard to interpret this as anything other than OP's barely-disguised fetish
Look at this guy's post history, it was 100% intentionally sexualized
    Well, okay, I guess, idk. Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to call him out on being a perv or something, it is still waaaaay too tame for that, and in the right context, there isn't actually anything wrong with that as well. I'm just saying that in context of a more serious story, it might do good to tone it down just a bit. As someone who does love watching anime, seeing an anime character having a serious moment and then having a skimpy outfit or exaggerated body features just doesn't do justice to the intended tone. I must admit, as an artist myself, I too struggled to draw outside the boundary of my original style, failing to match my character's visual tone with what I was trying to convey with the tone of the story. It's a hard thing to do, so intentional or not, I think it is a good thing to consider as an artist that your comfort style should change if you tell a different story with your drawings than you usually do, if that makes any sense.
And I'd humbly accept it! No matter the type, a support is a support. You've wrote these letters just for me! How could I get mad?
And nuked an entire continent
Thot rot lmao. I'll remember that
OP presents a blind, defenseless girl in her underwear just laying in the middle of a *medieval* city and expects us to believe that leprosy by itself would lead all of the men to just watch on with sad faces and go about their days.
This is a good bloodbourn reference 💯
I get the feeling that OP is one of the people who hasn't gotten a good night's sleep since Captain Marvel came out
So bioshock but a souls game
    I don't remember that being what Bioshock is about... I think it's more like Sinner which is an interesting game but incredibly hard because of the unique level system
        I meant the helping little sisters
Bro, Does everything you read here supposed to be a theory? OP's post is clearly tagged as Fan Art and as others stated has this What if or little match girl vibe.  There was a fan art posted here a while back of a Artorias and Malenia clashing. Does that mean there's a theory that they actually really fought in the lore? How about the Official elden ring gag manga, Did you take that seriously too?
    The art is one thing - the captions on each panel however tell a fan theory. Did you read them? That’s what my comment is directed at not the weird kawaii hentai Malenia
I'm good. I Thank for your support though!
Life is happier when you look away from hatred.
check their history lol
    Okay nvm, but my point still stands for this specific post. Wretches don't wear clothing and are the most believable for a delusional character
thats the spirit!
Like dying in a decisive battle against a naked hobo with two swords who's also wearing a pot on his head?
You can write fanfic, but people in that fandom won't always find it interesting or compelling. Write a John Wick fanfic where John is actually some loser who fantasized all his movies while watching Taken on repeat, and fans of John Wick probably won't care much for it.
    I'm mostly mentioning the few comments I saw of people saying stuff like "This isn't canon" or "But Malenia did beat Radahn" because they just legitimately seem confused about what this post is.
It's not GOOD fanfic though.

It's the world we're living... where people are demanding what's right and wrong.
Tell me you didn't pay attention to the lore without telling me.
Least biased Radhan chud
    I don’t give a hoot about radahn either tbh. Now show me some smough lore and you’ll have my full attention
Haha right, she nuked like a quarter of the continent
>I just checked your account and some of your posts are criminal

Got that right
Oh hell to the fuck nah
    Am I missing something? It’s mostly souls art, a couple of cosplays and memes. What part of it is so bad?
So many times they had to write her out of the lore to justify not beating her
    Genuinely made me laugh, thanks! xD

I could read it just fine, it just barely made any sense

AS IF MALENIA WOULD BE THE ONE GETTING THEIR ASS KICKED
    Her
        what?
            Her ass kicked
                their isn't exclusively used for lgbt people, it's just a gender neutral way to refer to someone. I didn't use it because I thought Malenia was non-binary
                    There is nothing to do with lgbt. You just use "their" if you don't know if someone is a man or a woman, but we know Malenia is a woman, so no point in "their". It's just english, not lgbt.
                        Their is gender-neutral, you don't use it for the sole reason of not knowing someone's gender. You can also use it for things that were previously mentioned.
                            "used to refer to a generic or unspecified person previously mentioned, about to be mentioned, or present in the immediate context): Someone left their book on the table. A parent should read to their child."

My point was you use it for something unfamiliar in that context, but we know she's a she. Well, we did. You said you thought she was non-binary.


>you don't use it for the sole reason of not knowing someone's gender

That was obviously an example.

Wretches start the game in their underwear.
    So does that mean they're naked forever for all time then or......
        Umm Elden ring no hit challenge speedrun(Español)
Playing devil's advocate he called her a wretch which if you pick that starting class your character is basically naked. But also as devil's advocate its not a strong arguement and OP should probably still go to horny jail.
Very *touching* 😏 (forgive me I am afflicted with madness)

   #AAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHGAAASAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHaaaaaHHHHHH
        Average madness reaction
Me when I hit phase two for the first time.
    LOL
I just assumed it was cuz she's poor and drawing her completely naked (because she's too poor for cloths) would've completely detracted from the story entirely.

Could've been better tho, maybe some rags that fell halfway down her belly and a makeshift skirt made of a ragged piece of cloth that barely reached her knees, would probably get the point across better.
    You mean could have been worse? Because your example stinks even more than ops
        Not according to public opinion
It reads as shallow to me, matched with the needless nudity it's a miss.
The most charitable interpretation would be that the author is kind of going for an "emperor's new clothes" thing for Malenia's wardrobe to go with the whole delusion angle.

At the same time, there is quite a bit speaking against it and that angle wouldn't really work since the emperor in the story was dressed that way due to having deluded himself in his extreme vanity.

There is actually quite a bit of interesting symbolism with Malenia and her clothes in the game. They are kind of treated as her chrysalis and only once she abandons them (and the shame human society associates with lack of clothes) does she unleash her full power as the "Rot Goddess".

That aside, in this case it's most likely to assume that OP is just very fond of Malenia being half naked, which does distract quite a bit from the story they are trying to tell.
    It is more like "The Little Match Girl" I think, imaginary family and dying to rot/cold and all that. Of course it has nothing to do with nudity, just talking about general story elements.
Because we are commenting on the thread of a weird, lonely boy.
If you’re blind, why wear clothes? 🤔
Cause she is naked in her boss-fight obviously
I read that in my mind with such conviction
I mean fair but like- could have still covered her in rags or tatters or something?
    Lowkey why doesn’t the wretch start with rags?
        Because the wretched aren’t allowed to have clothes.
A wretch with prosthetic legs but no clothes? Man, just say you're horny.
And you gave her big tits because…?
    Those aren’t big tits though.

        Buddy, the first two things in your post history are Sellen age regression art and Emma from Sekiro stripping. I simply do not believe you when you say that this isn't sexual.
            Jesus christ
        I would’ve kept this comment to myself. 

“I swear it’s not sexual! I would’ve drawn her tits freakishly huge if it were sexual!”
        Oda, is that you? 😂
        Honey…go ahead and pull up her in-game character model again. You made her chest like three times bigger.
        If you had no sexual intentions in this comic then you have fallen victim to the latent perversion and mysogony of Anime. Take badass strong lady and supply tearjerker alt story that reduces her power, places her below everyone else, and gives opportunity for closeups on a literal fucking g-string panty and bra outfit. Anime classic. Work on yourself man...
            Based comment. OP undeniably has problems with how they view women and their comment shows a considerable lack of self-awareness for someone who has enough motivation to draw as well (being generous here) as they do.
                Hopefully they come to understand it as they grow older. They're likely only teenage atm
            Lmao at the downvotes. Victims of anime brain poisoning
            How can you type this out without a hint of shame?
                Because I'm not wrong, OP has a fucked up view of women, and every downvote I get is from people like OP?
                    You’re absolutely not wrong
            Well to be fair that only happens in the most dogshit of harem anime
                It happens in some degree in almost every Anime, including otherwise fantastic ones. The only anime I can think of that doesn't do it is OG Ghost in the Shell
nothing against your art man, it's spectacular but in my opinion you could've made her look more like she's using rags as a dress, like Ymir's design from attack on titan.

Elden Ring is based on a medieval european setting with nordic influence (giant life tree, valhalla, valkyries) and in both settings the wrenchs use rags instead of only underwear, and even if you took inspiration from the literal wrench class, lore-wise it's not like they used to always dress like that while walking the streets of TLB.

anyways it's an amazing comic but it looks like fan-service kinda ruined it (even if it wasn't your intention)
This felt personal. I approve.
Plus a dash of jerking off to Radahn.  They are always weirds and cringes.
OP is literally just Maleigh Marais irl lmao
Wasn't millicent born in Aeonia? Like her and her sisters budded after Malenia cooked Caelid?
    Pretty sure yeah. Malenia pollinated (?) all of the sacramental buds and that's where all the rot children came from. 

So when Cleanrot Knight Finlay carried "Malenia's body" back to the Haligtree, it wasn't her actual corpse, but another one of those rot children. 

So there was the Malenia that fought Radahn that nuked Caelid, however many Malenias in between, and then Millicent is set to be the next one.
        Is this an actual idea that's presented in the lore or just fun speculation? I like it either way and it sounds cool but I'm curious.
            It is speculation at best. No where does it come close to saying Melania dies and gets replaced by these “rot children”
            It's fairly established in the game. Gowry speaks of having found Millicent and her sistsers as babies in the Swamp of Aeonia.

Then there's the fact Millicent also suffers from scarlet rot, shares parts of Malenia's memories to the point of knowing where she is, and is capable of performing waterfowl dance despite never having met her Malenia.

Malenia birthed the Scarlet Aeonia in Caelid and from that flower Millicent and her sisters were birthed. Gowry decribes them as daughters of Malenia, but I honestly think it's more apt to call them clones even if they're not a 1:1.
                Maybe it would be more apt to thing of them like a fungus since it's considered an extant form of life. Malenia is the core and Millicent and her sisters are her spores.
                    Yeah, I think that's a more accurate description.
                    Man, stop. I don't want to start another playthrough just to check one thing, again.
            Speculation. I just think it fits better than the lore as it's presented.

Why else would Gowry be so obsessed with creating Scarlet Valkyries? Despite the horrible stuff he puts them through, he seems to genuinely care about each one.

We know Malenia isn't eternal either. She's had to rely on Miquella to cure her before, which is one of the reasons she continues to wait for him.

Also, decay is an extant form of life. It exists in both life and death, so it makes sense if the goddess of rot would do the same.
                I agree with your comment and I do find it hilarious that Malenia can essentially reproduce like a fungus.
                    Reproduce like a fungus, evolve like a pokemon. She's basically a vileplume.
                        Malenia is a Pokémon confirmed

But *does* it?
[deleted]
    Oh I agree. You can make a similar theory for pretty much any fictional character ever. They rarely add anything interesting beyond being somewhat plausible by default. You can't prove that a story *isn't* just a given character's delusion after all.
Wow! That would be so sad and profoundly deep. Way better than the already existing story we’ve co-opted with our dumb additions.
Few more weeks... nah bro, i wish ;_;
It's that Ash has just been in a coma for the entire anime
    Jesus that's sad
        All 'theories' like this are sad. Beyond that, there's nothing remotely compelling about them.
*Literally* in the flavor text that it should’ve been or could’ve been *the* most sacred rune! Queen.
Yeah, imagine that she's some random girl delusionally believing she's Miquella's twin and trained by the blue dancer, but, because she is as powerful a warrior as she claims to be, people start to believe her deluded claims, and the Outer God of Rot takes notice of her and names her its Empyrean, thinking it's taking revenge by corrupting the apprentice of the warrior that locked it away.
    This right here is *infinitely* more narratively compelling and respectful to her character than OP’s comic.
Seeing all the "this made me cry" comments had me going "Yeah no this made me cringe".

My first thought was, why is she basically naked in dainty lingerie for any reason other than for creepy ass fanservice. Her head is also disproportionately large. A wretch wouldn't be living in the Capital.

If she was some delusional nobody, who would have gone through the time and effort of making advanced prosthetics too?
    It really is buck wild how many ppl look at this type of shit and think “awww how cute~” w/out *any* further consideration of context. Truly the barest surface-level reading comp.
        Also this is a personal thing but I hate this art style because it makes Malenia look like a bobble headed teenager as opposed to a graceful, powerful woman.
            Weebs and incels like their ladies physically “well-developed” but mentally schoolchildren.
                Which I don't think we need explain why that's just fucking gross.
I can even *defend* cringe! More ppl should be openly cringe. But this is just grody. “Oooo if only the Lands’ baddest motherfucker was a squishable anime doll instead.”
It really is.
You’re so fucking right.

“Remember that *other* crazy-powerful disabled god who ppl like to fetishize? Yeah he’s just gone! Poof!”
    Remember, the only disabled god who is allowed to be cool is Radahn because he learned ride to horse his gravity magic.
        True. I mean, I like fanfiction and headcanons and all that, but this felt like one long, drawn out comic to ride Radahn's fictional rotted shaft by putting Malenia down tbh
            The venn diagram of “ppl deifying Radahn as some gigachad” and “ppl who objectify and disparage Malenia” is a circle.
        Morgott and Mohg are both super cool though?
    Honestly, my guess is he died a child. “Eternal child” after all. In this case it’s because he died a child. But yeah. Kinda boring story. Too many “it was all a dream” vibes.
    God damn have y'all not heard of fanfic or separate canons?
        What’s it like having *near-zero* critical thinking and literary analysis? It must be *wild.*
            Why don't you let me know.
                See *that* was actually clever! So you *aren’t* stupid, just bad-faith. Fantastic.
    Literally all of the demigods and shard bearers have some sort of disability.  In fact Miquella is the least disabled; he doesn’t age sure but has a normal body (or did before getting Mohg’d but that’s a whole other can of worms).
        If you met a human being irl who had a condition that held them hostage in the body of a child I can reckon they might disagree about how disabling it is, champ.
            You conveniently failed to address the main point but go off, king.
                Queen*
        In the present, sure, but for many of them their 'disability' is either self-inflicted and/or didn't affect them before The Shattering. Radahn didn't start losing his mind till the fight with Malenia, Rykard was  able of body and mind till he fed himself to a giant Snake, and Ranni slew her own body to escape control of The Fingers. Mohg and Morgott probably qualify, being born as Omens, and Malenia and Miquella also have been afflicted for their entire lives. To that end, if we're counting recently acquired afflictions, I'd say Miquella's soul/consciousness being MIA qualifies at least as much as Radahn's.

 "Least disabled" is kind of a hard argument to make, even ignoring how contentious a prospect it is to rank types of disabilities by 'difficulty'. Mohg and Morgott are physically and mentally capable individuals, they experience nightmares and torment from their condition but their suffering is seemingly just as much a property of being mistreated by the Golden Order. Meanwhile I'm not sure whether being merged to an immortal snake God really counts as a disability or anything comparable. Likewise for Ranni, being a puppet doesn't stop her from doing what she wants to do with her life, and her original body was perfectly functional, but subject to control by someone else. Miquella had to undergo a physical transformation to fulfill his goal of becoming a God.
ok but then why is she wearing like pristine modern lingerie instead of tattered rags? Slide 8 is some Victoria's Secret shit.
    Also almost exactly what the Wretch class wears, seen [Here](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/file/Elden-Ring/wretch_class_elden_ring_wiki_guide_270px.png) and before you say that this one is more wrinkled, as nice as OP’s art style is, it’s not very detailed.
A rose by any other name
No *mate,* it wouldn’t actually!🙂 I am *literally* addressing the sexism re: why this shit happens to certain characters and not others.
    Agree to disagree, I think if someone's taking this comic seriously enough to think it's being sexist or to think Malenia is actually weak then they're kidding themself.
>”Imagine not being able to accept the idea of sad stories w/ no good ending.”

This is *not* what we’re talking about here dude and you *know* it lmao. I *refuse* to believe that you’re *actually* this dense.

*Log off.*
    Bro forgot this was the soulsborne fandom and good endings dont really exist that much 💀
    You say that while completely ignoring that I mentioned your point in a later part of the response, aand whether you believe so or not that is partially what you're talking about.

You can't accept that someone took one of the strongest characters in Elden Ring lore and "infantilized" her which was literally just them making a sad story of her, word it how you like but that's what you're upset about.
        I’m done arguing w/ a wooden post.
Never see this treatment of the *other* major Shattering players, even tho they’re all war crims too. Wonder why… (jk we all know why)
Radahn deserves the massive nerf then if we’re going by your logic
You seem like the type to draw yourself as the ugly bastard in your middling hentai.
    Guy is about to write Rent-A-Maiden lmao
We all know that's not true.
Your fanfiction is shit lol. What happened? Malenia kick your ass 1 too many times so you decided to write a whole ass fanfic about her being naked, delusional and weak? Im so glad your getting utterly roasted in these comments lol, because this post is genuinely pathetic. 

You gonna write “rent a maiden” next?
    Bro it's just a cringy fanfic calm down
    The upvotes on OP's post begs to differ. You might not like it but his take on malenia x the little match girl is fitting for the upcoming season and a breath of fresh air from whatever repetitive memes and content is being posted on this sub.
And this was almost a good comic
"It's a delusion" is some weak ass days of our lives shit
Is Caelid being nuked also a delusion of hers or what
I don't think the wretch starting equipment is a pristine lacy thong.
    That's what I'm saying, like slide 8 is literally a modern side-lacing bikini bottom ffs
Here tho it’s bc the artist wishes she was a naive and pitiable anime girl instead of an actual literal god.
    The OP specifically states it was to portray her as a wretch
        And *I’m* specifically stating that’s gross.🙂
            Fair, but still, I’m just saying it probably wasn’t a fetish thing.
                Oh my brother in christ it for *sure* is a fetish thing. Three things in life are certain: death, taxes, and horny dudes on the internet disempowering canonically powerful women into something more demure and fuckable.
                    It could be a fetish thing but I really don’t think that’s what is happening. This isn’t saying this is what Melania should have been, it’s a reimagining of her horrifically tragic story, with her just losing her godliness. She’s already fucked up in the head when you fight her. This isn’t trying to make her more fuckable, and she was always pitiable (having to rot away for her whole life, and losing her brother, who was literally a saint, to the creepy child predator that lives in the underworld) and just making it a different kind of pitiable. She is a better character without this retelling of the story, having her live a tragic life, losing her brother, rotting her whole life, existence shunned by the rest of the demigods, and in the biggest battle of her life, loses, only to be later meeting the same end as Radahn when the Tarnished kills her. Much better character with her original story. Or maybe I’m just to far into NNN to pay attention to horny things, I don’t really know. But again, probably not a fetish thing.
                        I’m not bothering to read this brick just bc you can’t see two feet in front of your face dude.

“She’s *just* losing her godliness,” “this *could* be a fetish thing but I just don’t see it,” what a world you must live in.

(Bonus round: you’re doing NNN, I’m in awe)
                            Yeah sorry not everyone is as pessimistic as you and immediately assumes the worst intentions. OP literally stated the actual reason, but you’re not even saying “maybe” you’re saying that it is “for sure” a fetish thing because why again? Projecting? I don’t like the “it was all a dream” thing personally, but I’m still not gonna shit all over someone’s fan fiction comic they went out of their way to share with people, and certainly not going to shit on their character based on so little. But you on the other hand have just gone out of your way to be an ass all over this post’s comments, to OP and pretty much anyone else I’ve seen you interact with who doesn’t assume the worst.
                            It’s NNN so maybe I’ve just become immune to horny things. But read the brick.
If your translator let this slide, you need to get a new one.
Well, okay, I guess, idk. Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to call him out on being a perv or something, it is still waaaaay too tame for that, and in the right context, there isn't actually anything wrong with that as well. I'm just saying that in context of a more serious story, it might do good to tone it down just a bit. As someone who does love watching anime, seeing an anime character having a serious moment and then having a skimpy outfit or exaggerated body features just doesn't do justice to the intended tone. I must admit, as an artist myself, I too struggled to draw outside the boundary of my original style, failing to match my character's visual tone with what I was trying to convey with the tone of the story. It's a hard thing to do, so intentional or not, I think it is a good thing to consider as an artist that your comfort style should change if you tell a different story with your drawings than you usually do, if that makes any sense.
I don't remember that being what Bioshock is about... I think it's more like Sinner which is an interesting game but incredibly hard because of the unique level system

You mean could have been worse? Because your example stinks even more than ops
    Not according to public opinion
It is more like "The Little Match Girl" I think, imaginary family and dying to rot/cold and all that. Of course it has nothing to do with nudity, just talking about general story elements.
Lowkey why doesn’t the wretch start with rags?
    Because the wretched aren’t allowed to have clothes.
Those aren’t big tits though.

    Buddy, the first two things in your post history are Sellen age regression art and Emma from Sekiro stripping. I simply do not believe you when you say that this isn't sexual.
        Jesus christ
    I would’ve kept this comment to myself. 

“I swear it’s not sexual! I would’ve drawn her tits freakishly huge if it were sexual!”
    Oda, is that you? 😂
    Honey…go ahead and pull up her in-game character model again. You made her chest like three times bigger.
    If you had no sexual intentions in this comic then you have fallen victim to the latent perversion and mysogony of Anime. Take badass strong lady and supply tearjerker alt story that reduces her power, places her below everyone else, and gives opportunity for closeups on a literal fucking g-string panty and bra outfit. Anime classic. Work on yourself man...
        Based comment. OP undeniably has problems with how they view women and their comment shows a considerable lack of self-awareness for someone who has enough motivation to draw as well (being generous here) as they do.
            Hopefully they come to understand it as they grow older. They're likely only teenage atm
        Lmao at the downvotes. Victims of anime brain poisoning
        How can you type this out without a hint of shame?
            Because I'm not wrong, OP has a fucked up view of women, and every downvote I get is from people like OP?
                You’re absolutely not wrong
        Well to be fair that only happens in the most dogshit of harem anime
            It happens in some degree in almost every Anime, including otherwise fantastic ones. The only anime I can think of that doesn't do it is OG Ghost in the Shell
Pretty sure yeah. Malenia pollinated (?) all of the sacramental buds and that's where all the rot children came from. 

So when Cleanrot Knight Finlay carried "Malenia's body" back to the Haligtree, it wasn't her actual corpse, but another one of those rot children. 

So there was the Malenia that fought Radahn that nuked Caelid, however many Malenias in between, and then Millicent is set to be the next one.
    Is this an actual idea that's presented in the lore or just fun speculation? I like it either way and it sounds cool but I'm curious.
        It is speculation at best. No where does it come close to saying Melania dies and gets replaced by these “rot children”
        It's fairly established in the game. Gowry speaks of having found Millicent and her sistsers as babies in the Swamp of Aeonia.

Then there's the fact Millicent also suffers from scarlet rot, shares parts of Malenia's memories to the point of knowing where she is, and is capable of performing waterfowl dance despite never having met her Malenia.

Malenia birthed the Scarlet Aeonia in Caelid and from that flower Millicent and her sisters were birthed. Gowry decribes them as daughters of Malenia, but I honestly think it's more apt to call them clones even if they're not a 1:1.
            Maybe it would be more apt to thing of them like a fungus since it's considered an extant form of life. Malenia is the core and Millicent and her sisters are her spores.
                Yeah, I think that's a more accurate description.
                Man, stop. I don't want to start another playthrough just to check one thing, again.
        Speculation. I just think it fits better than the lore as it's presented.

Why else would Gowry be so obsessed with creating Scarlet Valkyries? Despite the horrible stuff he puts them through, he seems to genuinely care about each one.

We know Malenia isn't eternal either. She's had to rely on Miquella to cure her before, which is one of the reasons she continues to wait for him.

Also, decay is an extant form of life. It exists in both life and death, so it makes sense if the goddess of rot would do the same.
            I agree with your comment and I do find it hilarious that Malenia can essentially reproduce like a fungus.
                Reproduce like a fungus, evolve like a pokemon. She's basically a vileplume.
                    Malenia is a Pokémon confirmed
Exactly lmao
Oh I agree. You can make a similar theory for pretty much any fictional character ever. They rarely add anything interesting beyond being somewhat plausible by default. You can't prove that a story *isn't* just a given character's delusion after all.
Jesus that's sad
    All 'theories' like this are sad. Beyond that, there's nothing remotely compelling about them.
This right here is *infinitely* more narratively compelling and respectful to her character than OP’s comic.
It really is buck wild how many ppl look at this type of shit and think “awww how cute~” w/out *any* further consideration of context. Truly the barest surface-level reading comp.
    Also this is a personal thing but I hate this art style because it makes Malenia look like a bobble headed teenager as opposed to a graceful, powerful woman.
        Weebs and incels like their ladies physically “well-developed” but mentally schoolchildren.
            Which I don't think we need explain why that's just fucking gross.
Remember, the only disabled god who is allowed to be cool is Radahn because he learned ride to horse his gravity magic.
    True. I mean, I like fanfiction and headcanons and all that, but this felt like one long, drawn out comic to ride Radahn's fictional rotted shaft by putting Malenia down tbh
        The venn diagram of “ppl deifying Radahn as some gigachad” and “ppl who objectify and disparage Malenia” is a circle.
    Morgott and Mohg are both super cool though?
Honestly, my guess is he died a child. “Eternal child” after all. In this case it’s because he died a child. But yeah. Kinda boring story. Too many “it was all a dream” vibes.
God damn have y'all not heard of fanfic or separate canons?
    What’s it like having *near-zero* critical thinking and literary analysis? It must be *wild.*
        Why don't you let me know.
            See *that* was actually clever! So you *aren’t* stupid, just bad-faith. Fantastic.
Literally all of the demigods and shard bearers have some sort of disability.  In fact Miquella is the least disabled; he doesn’t age sure but has a normal body (or did before getting Mohg’d but that’s a whole other can of worms).
    If you met a human being irl who had a condition that held them hostage in the body of a child I can reckon they might disagree about how disabling it is, champ.
        You conveniently failed to address the main point but go off, king.
            Queen*
    In the present, sure, but for many of them their 'disability' is either self-inflicted and/or didn't affect them before The Shattering. Radahn didn't start losing his mind till the fight with Malenia, Rykard was  able of body and mind till he fed himself to a giant Snake, and Ranni slew her own body to escape control of The Fingers. Mohg and Morgott probably qualify, being born as Omens, and Malenia and Miquella also have been afflicted for their entire lives. To that end, if we're counting recently acquired afflictions, I'd say Miquella's soul/consciousness being MIA qualifies at least as much as Radahn's.

 "Least disabled" is kind of a hard argument to make, even ignoring how contentious a prospect it is to rank types of disabilities by 'difficulty'. Mohg and Morgott are physically and mentally capable individuals, they experience nightmares and torment from their condition but their suffering is seemingly just as much a property of being mistreated by the Golden Order. Meanwhile I'm not sure whether being merged to an immortal snake God really counts as a disability or anything comparable. Likewise for Ranni, being a puppet doesn't stop her from doing what she wants to do with her life, and her original body was perfectly functional, but subject to control by someone else. Miquella had to undergo a physical transformation to fulfill his goal of becoming a God.
Also almost exactly what the Wretch class wears, seen [Here](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/file/Elden-Ring/wretch_class_elden_ring_wiki_guide_270px.png) and before you say that this one is more wrinkled, as nice as OP’s art style is, it’s not very detailed.
Agree to disagree, I think if someone's taking this comic seriously enough to think it's being sexist or to think Malenia is actually weak then they're kidding themself.
Bro forgot this was the soulsborne fandom and good endings dont really exist that much 💀
You say that while completely ignoring that I mentioned your point in a later part of the response, aand whether you believe so or not that is partially what you're talking about.

You can't accept that someone took one of the strongest characters in Elden Ring lore and "infantilized" her which was literally just them making a sad story of her, word it how you like but that's what you're upset about.
    I’m done arguing w/ a wooden post.
Guy is about to write Rent-A-Maiden lmao
Bro it's just a cringy fanfic calm down
The upvotes on OP's post begs to differ. You might not like it but his take on malenia x the little match girl is fitting for the upcoming season and a breath of fresh air from whatever repetitive memes and content is being posted on this sub.
That's what I'm saying, like slide 8 is literally a modern side-lacing bikini bottom ffs
The OP specifically states it was to portray her as a wretch
    And *I’m* specifically stating that’s gross.🙂
        Fair, but still, I’m just saying it probably wasn’t a fetish thing.
            Oh my brother in christ it for *sure* is a fetish thing. Three things in life are certain: death, taxes, and horny dudes on the internet disempowering canonically powerful women into something more demure and fuckable.
                It could be a fetish thing but I really don’t think that’s what is happening. This isn’t saying this is what Melania should have been, it’s a reimagining of her horrifically tragic story, with her just losing her godliness. She’s already fucked up in the head when you fight her. This isn’t trying to make her more fuckable, and she was always pitiable (having to rot away for her whole life, and losing her brother, who was literally a saint, to the creepy child predator that lives in the underworld) and just making it a different kind of pitiable. She is a better character without this retelling of the story, having her live a tragic life, losing her brother, rotting her whole life, existence shunned by the rest of the demigods, and in the biggest battle of her life, loses, only to be later meeting the same end as Radahn when the Tarnished kills her. Much better character with her original story. Or maybe I’m just to far into NNN to pay attention to horny things, I don’t really know. But again, probably not a fetish thing.
                    I’m not bothering to read this brick just bc you can’t see two feet in front of your face dude.

“She’s *just* losing her godliness,” “this *could* be a fetish thing but I just don’t see it,” what a world you must live in.

(Bonus round: you’re doing NNN, I’m in awe)
                        Yeah sorry not everyone is as pessimistic as you and immediately assumes the worst intentions. OP literally stated the actual reason, but you’re not even saying “maybe” you’re saying that it is “for sure” a fetish thing because why again? Projecting? I don’t like the “it was all a dream” thing personally, but I’m still not gonna shit all over someone’s fan fiction comic they went out of their way to share with people, and certainly not going to shit on their character based on so little. But you on the other hand have just gone out of your way to be an ass all over this post’s comments, to OP and pretty much anyone else I’ve seen you interact with who doesn’t assume the worst.
                        It’s NNN so maybe I’ve just become immune to horny things. But read the brick.

Those who have tasted the forbidden elixir alone cast accusations upon those entangled in similar indiscretions.

        their isn't exclusively used for lgbt people, it's just a gender neutral way to refer to someone. I didn't use it because I thought Malenia was non-binary
            There is nothing to do with lgbt. You just use "their" if you don't know if someone is a man or a woman, but we know Malenia is a woman, so no point in "their". It's just english, not lgbt.
                Their is gender-neutral, you don't use it for the sole reason of not knowing someone's gender. You can also use it for things that were previously mentioned.
                    "used to refer to a generic or unspecified person previously mentioned, about to be mentioned, or present in the immediate context): Someone left their book on the table. A parent should read to their child."

My point was you use it for something unfamiliar in that context, but we know she's a she. Well, we did. You said you thought she was non-binary.


>you don't use it for the sole reason of not knowing someone's gender

    There is nothing to do with lgbt. You just use "their" if you don't know if someone is a man or a woman, but we know Malenia is a woman, so no point in "their". It's just english, not lgbt.
        Their is gender-neutral, you don't use it for the sole reason of not knowing someone's gender. You can also use it for things that were previously mentioned.
            "used to refer to a generic or unspecified person previously mentioned, about to be mentioned, or present in the immediate context): Someone left their book on the table. A parent should read to their child."

My point was you use it for something unfamiliar in that context, but we know she's a she. Well, we did. You said you thought she was non-binary.


>you don't use it for the sole reason of not knowing someone's gender

That was obviously an example.
Hopefully they come to understand it as they grow older. They're likely only teenage atm
Because I'm not wrong, OP has a fucked up view of women, and every downvote I get is from people like OP?
    You’re absolutely not wrong
It happens in some degree in almost every Anime, including otherwise fantastic ones. The only anime I can think of that doesn't do it is OG Ghost in the Shell
Maybe it would be more apt to thing of them like a fungus since it's considered an extant form of life. Malenia is the core and Millicent and her sisters are her spores.
    Yeah, I think that's a more accurate description.
    Man, stop. I don't want to start another playthrough just to check one thing, again.
I agree with your comment and I do find it hilarious that Malenia can essentially reproduce like a fungus.
    Reproduce like a fungus, evolve like a pokemon. She's basically a vileplume.
        Malenia is a Pokémon confirmed
Which I don't think we need explain why that's just fucking gross.
See *that* was actually clever! So you *aren’t* stupid, just bad-faith. Fantastic.

Oh my brother in christ it for *sure* is a fetish thing. Three things in life are certain: death, taxes, and horny dudes on the internet disempowering canonically powerful women into something more demure and fuckable.
    It could be a fetish thing but I really don’t think that’s what is happening. This isn’t saying this is what Melania should have been, it’s a reimagining of her horrifically tragic story, with her just losing her godliness. She’s already fucked up in the head when you fight her. This isn’t trying to make her more fuckable, and she was always pitiable (having to rot away for her whole life, and losing her brother, who was literally a saint, to the creepy child predator that lives in the underworld) and just making it a different kind of pitiable. She is a better character without this retelling of the story, having her live a tragic life, losing her brother, rotting her whole life, existence shunned by the rest of the demigods, and in the biggest battle of her life, loses, only to be later meeting the same end as Radahn when the Tarnished kills her. Much better character with her original story. Or maybe I’m just to far into NNN to pay attention to horny things, I don’t really know. But again, probably not a fetish thing.
        I’m not bothering to read this brick just bc you can’t see two feet in front of your face dude.

“She’s *just* losing her godliness,” “this *could* be a fetish thing but I just don’t see it,” what a world you must live in.

(Bonus round: you’re doing NNN, I’m in awe)
            Yeah sorry not everyone is as pessimistic as you and immediately assumes the worst intentions. OP literally stated the actual reason, but you’re not even saying “maybe” you’re saying that it is “for sure” a fetish thing because why again? Projecting? I don’t like the “it was all a dream” thing personally, but I’m still not gonna shit all over someone’s fan fiction comic they went out of their way to share with people, and certainly not going to shit on their character based on so little. But you on the other hand have just gone out of your way to be an ass all over this post’s comments, to OP and pretty much anyone else I’ve seen you interact with who doesn’t assume the worst.
            It’s NNN so maybe I’ve just become immune to horny things. But read the brick.
