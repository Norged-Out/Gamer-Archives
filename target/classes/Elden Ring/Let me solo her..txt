[[Let me solo her.]]


If you've been playing Elden Ring and have tried to fight Malenia on PC, you might've crossed paths with a summon called "Let me solo her" . I've been helping countless tarnished in their quest to defeat Malenia by going butt naked except for a Jar on my head. Please enjoy this video of me soloing Malenia as a 3rd summon. My sign will be down for desperate Tarnished as always :)

The Jarnished

Edit: damn this blew up, anyways thx for the award
    This rolls off the tongue a bit better than calling him “Let me solo her”
        How dare you speak ill of his name!
    r/awardspeechedits
I beat Malenia with the help of a player named "I Die One Hit". True to his word, he died in a single hit, right before I landed the final hit on Malenia. 

Before that, he was bleeding her every few hits. It was glorious to watch.

        Isaac and his mother lived alone in a small house...
            That voice etched itself into my ears. whenever I read this somewhere, I can hear it as clear as someone playing it in a video
            Isaac kept to himself, drawing pictures, and playing with his toys, as his mom watched christian broadcasts on the television.
    I'm still confused how to summon other players for coop
        Use Furlcalling Finger Remedy and you’ll be able to see summon signs
        As has already been said, use the furlcalling finger remedy. It allows you to see summon signs from other players around your level. 

If you summon other players, you're opening yourself up to invasions. 

You can also set a password to summon friends of any level.
Malenia fighting you for the 48th time: “look, it doesn’t matter what summon or magic you use, you just gotta git g-“

            With the amount of time LMSH spent with Malenia I wouldn't find this strange at all

        I think The Razors Edge would make a much more apt and imposing walk on song.
            I was thinking something like Ready to Die by Andrew W.K.
                Nah, Stone Cold Steve Austin's entrance music.
                    I'd pay a lot of money to see Malenia take a Stunner.
                        Bah gawd thats Jarhead's music!!

"You can't beat me" 

"I know. But he can."

    *soul of cinder plays*
    "I am Let Me Solo Her, the seeker of power. Doth thou desire the power?"
    Malenia is actually wrong about that, bleed works brilliantly. The other option is to parry which is also easy. I used buckler and dagger and it worked well. I hate her silly combo tho. I don't think I'll ever consistently dodge that.
    I beat her but it was so chaotic I never realized in her second form those little incantation thingy’s were her thrusts. I was just rolling around praying my endurance held
Be wary of legend
    Legend has said that the pot on his head is a nerf. It's for the bosses to have a fighting chance.
        He nerfs himself like Kenpachi from bleach fucking legend.

        If he ever actually dies, he just takes the pot off like Godfrey snapping Serosh's neck.
        So he is only on pc?
    Praise the legend!
Is this it? Is this the fabled 'git gud' people speak of?

        Long lost son of John Dark Soul
        He is a man of focus and sheer fucking will.l
    This man was born gud
        Git'n gud before there was any gud to be git'n
            Gud gittin done
                Aragorn: you have my sword.

Legolas: and  you have my bow.

Let me solo her: and you have my pot.
            you know what they say... when the git'n gits gud, the gud git git'n.
            He git gud before the shattering
        My man came out the womb and was clothed in an oversized loincloth. 

His father knew of the great gud he was to be one day. 

“He’ll grow into it,” were the only words he uttered.
            As he placed a jar on the head of the wingless, the true misbegotten took a whity-tighty form.
        What is better: to be born gud or to overcome your scrub nature through great effort?
            Not sure, but BallsDeep69 seems to know what's up.
                My name is Klein!
                    Well, that was unsettling.
                        Yeah. I correct people so much they think it's how I greet people.
            Theres no reason i took this obviously rhetorical question so seriously but definitely overcome scrub nature. You'll eventually meet your match one day, and if you have experience to fall back on, youll be all the more capable. Being born gud is being born with a blind spot you wont know until its game over. You either git gud, or youre only gud enough to git got.
        he was born in it, molded by it
            …you think “git gud” is your ally?
                We merely adopted the 'git gud'...
                    He was born in it!
                        Also molded by it
                            He did not see the grace until he beat the game and by then it was nothing to him but BLINDING
                                I absolutely believe this individual to do a no-grace run.
                    Do you think that's 'git gud' you're breathing?
                        Stop trying to 'git gud' and 'git gud'!
                    If I take that "git gud" off your face, will you die?
                        It would be extremely painful
                            You're a big jar
                                For you
            I was nothing until I put on the jar.
                Let’s not stand on ceremony here, Tarnished…
                If you’re nothing without the jar, then you shouldn’t have it
        Maybe he's born with it. Maybe it's Elden Ring.

        Go full wizard, get moonveil and something with bloodhound step on it for your right hand, staff for your left. Fully upgrade it all. Upgrade both mimic and Black Knife Tiche. Get the important spells by looking up guides on youtube. Find the power-leveling spots and over-level. 

If you have no shame you can beat the game and it's not that bad, quite fun actually. I'm a dad gamer that likes to have a beer or two while playing and I did it. With bloodhound step and a summon Malenia's a bit of a pushover, I had the most trouble with the Elden Beast until I was able to line up one good flask chug into Meteorite of Astel (which took off more than half it's HP bar).

I'll never claim to be actually good at the game, but I did beat it and I'll take that.
            Dude, that was my build too. Melania was still tough, but the Elden Best was just frustrating. Hoping it’s better on my unga bunga play through
                Want to know the trick for unga-bunga Elden Beast? It's called Fallingstar Beast Jaw.

Yeah, you'll have to invest a lil' bit of int to use it, or just boost it with gear, however, the weapon art on this thing trivializes any boss encounter you might have problem with. Just summon your Mimic, stand there and smack someone with lightning until they die. Gravity Bolt staggers bosses in like 3-4 casts, does massive damage, costs little to no FP and can be chain-casted real quick. Certified cheese right there.

The other option is if you don't want to invest any int - and it's Flame of the Redmanes. Get this bad boy, slap it on any heavy bonk stick you might want to use, steamroll through the game. Takes a bit to cast, costs more FP than Gravity Bolt, but staggers like no tomorrow. You can stagger pretty much anything in up to 3 casts, walk up, crit, repeat.
                    Eleanoras pole blade is also great if you want to have a stagger party.  It has a godlike weapon art that does insane poise damage, stacks bleed, is super mobile and is one of the most fun weapon arts to use IMO.
                        That thing also gives you poise and I-frames, it's insane.
                        Yeah, it's not a big bonk stick though. Therefore, no unga bunga, and no unga bunga = no fun.
                        I looove Eleonora's so much. Bloodblade Dance is the guddest I can hit 😂
                    Boy, it's a good thing I boosted every special weapon to +9 because I think this one will actually get some use from me now!
                        Yeah, I'm doing a "magical bonk" build, currently dual-wielding Royal Greatswords at NG+2 while going for every ending, and while my trusty ultras are usually enough, I keep that Cheesingstar Beast Jaw in my pocket for especially annoying fights.
                It's not, you spend half the time running after it.
                    And then by the time you catch it, all your stamina is gone so you can’t even get the max hits in before it runs away again
                        And the distances you had to run! It was SO FAR AWAY, and when you reached it half the time it was instantly in the sky or on the other side again. Why wasnt the arena at least a little smaller?
                I found the unga-bunga fine. Here's my history:

My first character was a blocky-boy. I held my shield up and took light chip damage to everything Radagon and Beast could do (except grabs, had to fatroll the grabs to save a flask charge). He did up to NG+2 without me having to learn Radagon's moveset in the least, just equipped a Fingerprint shield, the scaled set, and anything thrusting.

My second character was a giga-bonk (dual colossal maces) unga build and beat the game with them at \~level 100-115. I was really worried about never learning Radagon before. Here's a hint, his face hates being smashed. Actually, everything seemed to hate having their faces smashed in by 4 colossal hammers. I don't know if I landed a single dodge on him, I just spammed jump-smash until he hit me, let my mimic grab aggro and flasked. Then resumed jump-smashing. I had 10 flask charges total, at +5. I used 7 charges on Radagon.

Elden Beast was weak to bonk too. I whiffed three of his 4-hit holy slash combo (again, I've never dodged before) and had to heal up from 5% HP, but he died really fast and didn't get to do very much. If you can do the ring jump once or twice, that's all it takes (hint for melee, run directly away from where he air-twirlies. He will resurface directly in front of you after you jump the ring. Bonk his brains out, *unload that stamina bar in his stupid swimming face hole*.)
                I was so frustrated on elden beast then I equipped pearldrake talisman +2 and haligdrake talisman +2 and it was so much better. You can also mix a wondrous physick to absorb non physical damage and damage from a spell. All this made me beat Elden Beast first try in NG+ after struggling without
                [deleted]
                    Same. Rip on magic all you want, but I’m out here healing, swinging giant frost greatswords, cosplaying goku, sniping enemies with a greatbow, raining down meteors and hellfire, and shooting a fucking moon at my enemies. It’s so much fun that I don’t care if it’s not the true souls experience.
                Elden Beast feels lika a fight designed to be fought on horse... It's not that difficult, IMO, but so fucking annoying to keep running after it
            For me I beat Elden beast by using the Radagon cheese where you run up on him right after loading in with a light load and spam carian slicer on him without staggering him while he doesn’t move. On the last hit throw on that one talisman that keeps aggro on you and summon your mimic tear then replace the talisman with whatever it was before. Get to elden beast and use bloodhound’s step on your right weapon and rock sling w/ meteorite staff in your left. Some good rng just made it a waiting game for him to die and some staggers kept my mimic alive. 27 faith for the holy damage negation spell was also a godsend. 


I don’t feel bad at all about circumcising radagon. Tried the fight normally around 30ish times and did fine on him but could barely ever get Elden beast to half. It’s just a horrible fight all around for a melee build.
                I’m happy for you, or sorry that happened. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m about to face the Elden Beast for the 200th time. This ones it, I can feel it.
                    [deleted]
                        Stop. Come back tomorrow and suddenly and inexplicably one shot him. This is the way.
                        That’s happened to me a few times over the last week with Fire Giant. I’ll get him soon. I can taste it.
                    Don't forget to come back and let us celebrate with you when you win!
                    I have a Faith built using a sacred hammer and longsword along with the brass shield. 

Radagon phase: summoned Tiche (black flame does wonders on gods), was about shield and counterattacks, along with matching talismans (curved sword, crimson assassin...). Very important: I used the divine protection, the one provided by Sir Gideon Ofnir after being defeated, it significantly lowers the damage taken.

Beast phase: divine protection cast, then switching to Radagon's Icon, the incantation buff talisman, close up and using the pest's needles incantation. It obliterates huge enemies taking all the needles (works very nicely with dragons as well). The rest of the time, I run away from the Elden stars and huge aoe, and keep on raising my shield when getting close to it.

You'll block holy at 98.7%, and what gets through won't hurt to much.  Last run on NG6, I used 1 heal pot for the encounter, and I'm no amazing gamer.
                I had trouble at first with the elden beast with melee. Then I found spamming strong attacks after it does it's 3 hit swipe with the sword will almost always guarantee a stagger.
            Dad gamer here. I over leveled to 160 str/fai and used toot flute on elden beast. I just want to get high in the evenings and fuck around with bosses and cool spells/skills.
            You can basically skip everything before you say 'over-level' and just do that with any build. Over levelling guarantees success simply because you put in the effort to grind instead of trying to immediately get on the level of broken sword only runs because of the mental gymnastics and pressure the community pumps out about gitting gud and beating the game with as many handicaps as possible. These games are about winning by any means and playing how you want, so there's no shame no matter what you do.
             No hate on people who do use that build but I hate the thought of having to change my build just for a boss. Every souls game I've played my first run has been a faith/strength build and by god I will beat my paladin head against every brick wall this game has
    This guy reminds me of a dude back when WoW first came out. A player named Swampy, an orc warrior, he would hang out at the Barrens flight point area and help newbs and fight off alliance gankers. A true hero.
        Which server was that on? Had a similar dude, then I did the same as a lvl 60 undead rogue waaaay back in the day. Just walk up and one shot things then dance for them.
            Angwe? The most legendary vanilla rogue in wow?
                Angwe was an Orc a menace of the harbor. I wished I was that much of a ganker.
    This guy is the absolute guddest. 

Look at his flasks, he doesn't even need the shit.
it's always the naked dudes that fucking crush. everytime.
    They have to be naked to not be overencumbered by their enormous dong

Is Elden Ring lke the Dark Souls games where bosses get more HP when you co-op? Watching your vid it looked like malenia had like 3x the normal hp, tanky as fuck.
    50% per person. So she would have double the HP for 2 summons
        Wow I'd forgotten, makes this even more impressive @.@
    It is indeed.
        apparently skill scales harder than HP
            Just don't get hit 🤷‍♂️
                well shit, I've been playing all wrong

                What if getting hit is part of my skill?
            [deleted]
    She also heals every time she hits you and her flurry of attacks is rather difficult to dodge consistently. I beat her but not after she whooped my ass for about an hour.
        In the video OP doesn't get hit a single time, including during the Waterfowl Dance she uses twice (though not at all in phase 2). She can't heal if she doesn't hit you...
            Why did her health bar look all janky when she gets hit? Looked she was getting hit, healing some dam then getting hit again.
                Lag, possibly.
                Just standard FromSoft multiplayer jank lol.
                Coop lag.
            As a melee character who’s no where near as good as OP, while I’m very much aware if I avoid getting hit she can’t heal, she just does.
                OP dodges her blade, while most of us guide ourselves into it.
                    I have mastered the art of becoming one with the blade
                        ... just not my own.
            It's a good showcase as to how one can dodge the Waterfowl Dance, both when further away (first time) and when directly under her (second time). I keep seeing comments saying it is actually impossible to dodge that attack etc. and I think it will be helpful to learn the dodge timing he uses. Because once you figured the fight out (arguably before that aswell but anyways), it is imo one of or the greatest fight in the game. Gives one the amazing duel kind of feeling when playing solo melee!
                His close range dodge is only possible because of light roll, medium roll needs a even tighter frame to dodge and you might need to run closely around her while she's in the air (haven't tried medium roll with his technique yet)
        Tip: dont get hit
            Shit I knew I was fucking something up
The man, the myth, the pothead

Whenever I feel like a boss is unbeatable I’ll remember your exploits.  If a naked man with a pot on his head can beat arguably the hardest boss in the game, then I can beat the fire giant.

I BEAT HIM!!!
    You can summon Alexander as a cooperator. His summon sign is a golden patch in the snow just past the fog door, easy to miss
        Nice, didn’t realize this.  I imagine I’ll need to do his quest first.  Is it too late?
            I think so. I met him at the Radahn Festival then again like at the magma fields area to get him unstuck. Not sure what's the precise requirement tho
                I missed him in Limgrave, saw him at the festival, and saw him in the magma fields and I was able to use him in the Fire Giant fight so you can 100% skip the Limgrave one it seems.
                    His quest is very forgiving. He appears generally in this order:

>!Limgrave, Gael Tunnel, Radahn, Liurnia, Mt. Gelmir, Fire Giant, and Farum Azula!<

I actually accidentally skipped him in Liurnia and still managed to finish his quest. So I would assume the important ones are probably >!Radahan, Mt Gelmir, and Farum Azula.!< That would be my guess. You do miss out on a few items if you don’t meet him and help him get unstuck.
                    ^ this

In fact this is my exact experience in my playthrough actually. Was then able to complete his questline after that, in the next area past the Fire Giant.
                    In 4 of 5 play throughs he hasn’t even shown up in Liurnia for me, after the festival I only find him in Mt. Gelmir after that. Once I’ve seen him in Liurnia.
                He is not stuck in the lava stream. He is in there by choice. It isn't hot enough to "temper" him, however, so he seeks the giant's flame. That's why you meet him in the fire giant's boss room.
                    You are right, thanks for the clarification. Had momentarily forgotten the details by this point.
                I met him in limgrave and got him unstuck but I don’t think I’ve seen him since.
                    Hmm, assuming you have beaten Radahn he may still be at Radahn's site of grace. Fextra says his dialogue here needs to be exhausted before he will move on to other places.

Full article for the other locations afterwards: https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Iron+Fist+Alexander
                    Not sure how far you are, but you can complete his quest basically at any time it seems.

Avoiding spoilers, you see him again for the Radahn Festival in Caelid. He'll then go train somewhere hot, to temper himself. You can meet him again near a giant sky pot, inside a boss arena (as a summon). Finally, you can see him in a swirly crumbly timey wimy zone.

I think he pops up a few other places too, but those seem like the most story important places to find him.
                    Probably 
>!talk to him at radahns’ arena may not be necessary but exhaust dialogue!<
>!find him stuck again in luirnia need oil pot. Recipe book sold by merchant in siofra river ( up scaffolding in the middle he’s hidden above the flower)!<
>!also jairburn (not sure if that’s right but jar town) is near there so look around!<
>!will find him near a fort in Mt. gelmir behind a lava wyrm!<
Should be available for fire giant at this point I believe.
            Hm. Maybe? He may still be stuck in the ground. Or he could be in the battlefield after the radahn fight
                Stuck in the ground in Liurnia but it’s overlooking the jar people town on top of the cliff. Need an oil pot and preferably but not required a colossal weapon
                    I never found him there, but still managed to summon him for Fire Giant and then complete his questline shortly after.
            Look up his questline, you'll likely be able to find where he is in your current playthrough
            If you haven't beaten the giant you might still be in time, you need to follow his quest line until you find him after a magma wyrm in Mt Gelmir. If you're too late I still encourage you to follow his quest line since in the end you get a very useful talisman.
            If I may offer a suggestion, I used Torrent the whole time. I’d zip in, get a hit or two on his ankle, and zip out. You can outrun/dodge any attack except his wave attack (puts plate in grounds and throws upwards, spraying ice/rocks in a cone). Don’t run too far so he doesn’t use this attack. 

For his 2nd phase, same idea. It’s tough to get his forearms at a good time so just zip in, poke his no-leg, and forearms when available.
            Keep in mind, there's two entrances to the Fire Giant arena, his summon sign is only at one of those.
        I really don't recommend summoning him, as it will disable Torrent, and fighting the giant just on foot is very hard.
            I have heard that, and that phase 2 of the Giant fight on horseback becomes trivial. Hasn't been my experience at all, but admittedly I'm much more comfortable fighting on foot even after all those dragons & tree sentinels. Conversely I felt the fight was much easier with Alexander and his excellent tankiness & aggro-drawing. So I guess ones mileage may vary.
                I wouldn't say Torrent trivialized phase 2, but it certainly made it easier to avoid some projectiles and reposition for the floaty Sun spells. My mimic lasted just long enough for me to play patiently with Torrent for the last 20% health. Everyone's boss experiences differ, love that about these games.
                True enough! I've actually had more trouble with the Giant than other late game bosses, even with Torrent. But everyone has their own style.
            i actually found the fight way easier not suing the horse
                Horse litigation
                    Let’s go toe-to-toe on horse law and see who comes out the victor.
                Me too. Easier to stay under him and cling close to his legs
        Tiche is the best for that fight because her Destined Death will burn a lot of hp away for you
        "A golden patch in the snow" you say? I was always taught to stay away from those but I'll have to check that out.
    I don't understand how some people are so good at video games. There is a modded boss for Hollow Knight called Any Radiance that was made to be the hardest boss imaginable, and of course, three people have done it without taking damage. I will never understand how people get this good, no matter what I do I make the same mistakes over and over and only beat hard bosses by getting lucky.
        I think my biggest takeaway from this video is that this guy is patient. It's not easy to be patient.
            As I was watching I was constantly pointing out moments I would've jumped in to attack Melania and they did not.
                Seems he had really only 2 or three attacks he knew he could safely go in after. The rest of the time he was just avoiding damage which is tricky enough. 

It's almost like it's possible other attacks are also ok to counter but more risky so why try for them. Wait for the best ones. Dodge the rest. Once you learn the broadcasts, I guess that's the full package. 

That and not being a spaz which is always my problem.
                    See what I do is an advanced technique you probably haven’t heard of. I do the exact same thing except I decide to just face tank a hit in exchange for a morsel of damage which causes me to miss all those openings because I’m busy getting stabbed during my sip. A true gamer strat that only worked thanks to the power of way too much vigor lmfao
                    The absolute discipline is truly impressive.  That and his god-tier evasion of the Waterfowl dance point blank, plus the clone spam that got me so many times.

Then again, I guess if I fought Melania as much as this dude has, I might be better at it.
                        The point blank waterfowl dodge had my mouth wide open. I didnt know you could even pull that off. I had seen people do it when they were ready and do the run away and redirect but from point blank? Amazing.
                            I've seen people do it in a couple of videos, sometimes it looks like they just roll blindly and get lucky, but this was clearly an intentional and perfectly executed dodge.
                                With multiplayet latency no less.
                    A good way to practice is to literally just avoid their attacks as long as you can without going for a hit. Make it muscle memory. I think there's a difference in viewing the fight from someone like OP. A lot of people focus on when to attack, when they should be focusing on when to avoid. So it just becomes a battle of impatience, where you're itching to attack them and end up attacking at an inopportune time.

I'm still working my way through the game, and trying to have more patience. I've been doing mediocre.
                    That was my strategy for Margit, and Manus from DS1, stand back and bait out the punishable attacks
                    Yeah, he played really safe, which is risky in it's own way (the fight last longer)
                    Think the ideais you don't know what comes next after her shorter attacks, if it's another short attack you'll get hit. Prob better to wait for attacks with a guaranteed cooldown.

In her 2nd form she seems to emit a short explosion for attacks with cooldowns, which is a nice tell.

Also, dude can even parry her sword attacks, did it in another run.

Edit: ah wait it wasn't this guy, it was MoonMoon who was parrying her attacks. He's a streamer I was watching beat the game at soul lv. 1. Was using a shield + katana for this fight.
                It's that patience to wait, like when you know they are just one or two hits, that separate the wheat from the Chad's.
                    I've been playing these since Demons Souls on PS3. Still can't resist the allure of trying to get in one more hit.
            Yeah, we have COUNTLESS threads shitposting about Greatswords and Colossals being shit and gimping you in hard boss fights because your moveset gets restricted to just 3 moves + Weapon Art. Yet here's a guy relying most on just a jump attack and a follow-up R1 slash and doesn't even use bloodhound a single time. 

Patience is the real super power.
            MoonMoon beat her last night with a level 1 toon. It took like 12+ hours of attempts. Basically just perseverance.
        I have so much time into Hollow Knight, and I did everything except for the like... Godseeker? Is that what it's called? And NKG. and of course the Radiance fight. I survived everything else only to get my ass handed to me by Radiance over and over and over. I can't imagine there being a harder version of this fight. And people beating it with no damage. I won't even touch steel soul. Nope. Can not make it far without dying. 

I thought I was a gamer. Then the internet showed me I suck. 😅 Oh well. It's fun.
            There's an interesting video discussing how ridiculous the fight is and the fact that people beat it anyway https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kkGaF2vs8o
                No idea about that game, but it was a very entertaining video. Thanks for sharing.
                tuned in for a few minutes.. watched the whole hour.
            There's actually already a harder version of the Radiance fight in the unmodded game (along with several other new bosses) in Godhome, the boss rush area associated with the Godseeker. She's called Absolute Radiance, and she is harder than anything else in the game by an order of magnitude. Plus, in order to get the Godhome ending, you have to beat her at the end of a boss rush that includes *every other boss in the game* first.

Getting that victory is probably my single proudest gaming achievement.
                Amen. That’s my platinum trophy sitting on the top shelf above all others. The rush. The absolute rush of finally killing her after so many times getting so close. The only other moment from a video game that can beat even souls boss victory rush.
                I bet that was an amazing feeling. I couldn't handle some of the beefed up bosses in Godhome. I got there. I checked the place out. Made it through some of the rushes and some of the simpler challenges. But nah, definitely not good enough at HK to make it through that content. 😅 I was proud enough of what I did accomplish. You though. Take an upvote and my mad respect.
        Totally,  also since your inputs get stored if you do an extra input is enough to ruin the whole fight, I always roll( panic roll) more that I want or do that extra unnecessary attack(greed attack) that fucks it all up.
        Tangentially related, I think I saw one of the most skillful plays of a game ever yesterday. Not a boss, but a kaizo mario run.

First I watched the videos that arguably popularized kaizo mario: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2A4C8FFD54A1AA10

These videos show a friend of the level designer play through his romhack. Superbly edited videos, showing every death, excellently communicating the feelings of the player without wasting your time and by only showing gameplay.

Then I watched this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv5Lpzzjf6s

I think another category of incredible is the blindfolded sekiro speedruns (just search youtube for it)
    What stood out to me was the patience and restraint. Waiting out attack after attack until the brief moment of vulnerability, executing the same combo or a single hit, then backing off and waiting again. I’m starting to think that panicked flailing might not be the angle I should take…
        Exactly this. I've just started with DS2, so I'm not gud yet, but watching this video I thought of all the times I tried to sneak just one more attack on a boss, even though I know the window is closing. I try to make the fight faster that way, but instead I just make it go many times longer having to repeat it over and over.
        I haven't played Elden Ring but have watched tons of streamers play it. What I've noticed is that everyone loved the game when it came out. And then they started reaching the end game bosses and they all kind of hated them. And this is why. They only have one or two attacks that allow for counter attacks. It doesn't really make for a good boss fight.

I watched that whole video and it's basically just dodging everything she does waiting for her to do the one attack that is safe to counter attack.
            There are plenty of opportunities for aggression and counter attacks, Malenia is just fairly punishing if you go too far. This guy was even more careful than necessary though and he was able to do it no-hit, but if you aren't trying for that specific challenge, you should easily be relatively fine being more aggressive than him.

Lots of streamers are whiny man-children. Don't take their opinions on boss fights as gospel.
        Same here. Such restraint and zen from that guy. She kept leaving fake openings that I would have rushed like an idiot but he always waited for her attack to finish then hit twice and left. Dodge back from her sword and sideways for projectiles. Amazing
    What’s your build? I did it with my ruins great sword. Took a while but ALWAYS being behind him and on Torrent and smackin the nub worked for me
        Smackin the NUB
            Lil stump getting straight bonked
        Using Margott’s cursed sword with Dex 40, Arc ~20, and Vig 40.  I’ve gotten him to around 20% health on one of my better runs but can’t quite finish him.
            Is it the double shot of the straight fireballs that gets you? Cause of that's the case roll forward last second or run for cover. 

Only reason I guess that is because that's what majority of my hosts die to 

Otherwise...

If it's the slow moving balls just run near them then away and they whiff every time. 

If it's melee attacks, all I can say is timing. 

If it's his big ass rolls, stick to right left as he mostly seems to go to his left. 

And it should never be the firestorm that gets you, classing "don't stand on the red circles" mechanic
            Ahhh. I’m like pure str/vig besides some dex+ stuff to wield ruins.
    Remember that the boss had 2 coop increased health as well
    Fire Giant took me forever, got it finally with mimic summon, and upgraded blade of rot and reduvia. Just bled and rotted him. Took a long ass time, but worked better than my great swords.
    While I totally agree with the sentiment I would like to caution against going fully into this mentality. Believe I could be as good as the video was source of so much physical stress over the years. Dont beat yourself up over mistakes you make just because someone else wouldn't have made that mistake. They made it at some point and learned how to not make it in the future
I am Malenia, Blade of Miquella, and.....this fucking guy.... fuck this.

        A bit unrelated, but I have to ask, is it just me, or is this madman fighting her using keyboard + mouse? 

I just noticed in the video that all the button prompts are for the keyboard and not a controller. I swear, if they are, it's just another layer of impressiveness on top of how impressed I already am…

Edit: since I'm getting questions about the difference between using KB+M and a controller for these games from folks who have never played them, as a brief explanation, using a controller is generally more intuitive as the movement is designed around having control via analog sticks, as opposed to a limited set of directional inputs that generally comes with the keyboard (i.e. up/down/left/right), as well as limited space to move your mouse around depending on your setup. As someone who previously played using both KB+M and controller in previous games, I can also say that using KB+M can also be tricky with the bindings and personally took me much longer to adapt to than using a controller.

The other issue is that historically the souls games have had very poor implementation for KB+M; in fact, in DS1 I recall that it required a fan to create a patch to get it to even work. I personally can tell you that it was not a fun time trying to learn keyboard/mouse controls in the previous games and that ultimately a controller was a much easier and more intuitive choice. That being said, I'm now being told that apparently the KB+M implementation is actually pretty good in Elden Ring, so perhaps From finally figured out what they were doing. I'll personally be sticking with the controller, though.
            [deleted]
                Wait until everyone finds out it’s actually a guitar hero guitar configured to keyboard inputs instead of controller.

                        Dreamcast fishing controller. If someone can beat soul calibur on its hardest difficulty with it…
                            Donkey Kong bongos.
                                There is a YouTuber who is doing Elden Ring on the Donkey Kong bongos! ZeroLenny 😂
                Does it with a million souls in the bag without getting hit too. I'm guessing he does this _a lot_
                    Furled Fingers don't lose souls when they die!
                    He wouldn't lose them if he died anyway...
            I'd almost wager it's a benefit in a fight like this where you can more quickly change direction of motion to get away from the first burst of waterfowl dance, but this is like 95% this guy being an absolute unit and having her moveset memorized.
            I dont think kb + mouse are as bad as ppl say they are. I beat her with them.
                Yeah I use kb+m I dont know why people think it's so bad
                    [deleted]
                        I know I remapped the change spells to one of my mouse buttons since hitting the arrows on my keyboard was just not reasonable most times. But I wound up beating the game and achievement bosses barely swinging my sword save for Blasphemous blade's ash of war but even then that was desperation mode. Otherwise it was just throw a fireball and watch my skeletons die in the corner.
                            > watch my skeletons die in the corner

And resurrect. And die. And resurrect.

For as awesome as Tiche can be, nothing carries harder than Lloyd and Harry do, my trusty if stupid skeleton militamen.
                            Yep. My mouse wheel is changing flasks/consumable and also changing incants. Also makes it easy to get on torrent as I have that set to E+mwheel
                        "How tough are ya?"

"I beat Malenia with default key bindings"

"Right this way sir!"
                            It’s honestly not that hard once your hands learn WASD. Movement in any game pretty much feels natural. Also a mouse has better aim.
                                Most PC gamers are going to be completely familiar with WASD. Even with that, the \*other\* default bindings are insane in ER. 'F' to jump? To run and jump attack someone, you would have to hold 'W' + Space + Shift + Mouse Button. It's crazy. Using your pouch requires taking your hand off the mouse and using directional arrows, while also using 'E'. I'm convinced they were chosen by/for Ranni.
                    Started DS3 on mouse and keyboard so couldnt adapt for bloodborne. Beat DS2 sotfs, sekiro, and now Elden Ring all on mouse and keyboard, dunno what the issue is?
                        Original souls games had terrible PC ports where using KB+M was absolutely horrendous.

They've been better about it in their more recent titles, but the stigma around them remains.
                            That is fair, Scholar of the first sin re-release still needed a lot of keys re-bound
                        You beat Ds2 on Mouse and keyboard? Respect, that port is anus. Not as bad as the DS1, wherein Heavy Attack was bound to 'H'
                    Dark Souls : prepare to die edition is why.
                    For me it's mostly two things:

* Mouse camera control was clearly done by a developer who had only a wikipedia article to figure out what a "mouse" is. And he accidentally used the one for the animal, of course.
* Keyboard doesn't let you bind individual actions, rather it forces you to use the some artificial combos as the controller *needs*. But it's a need there, so on the controller it's somewhat understandable. On KB, something as basic as dodge and sprint being on the same button just annoys the piss out of me somehow. I got more than enough buttons, let me actually use them!
                KBM is better for me than controller, the only Soulsborne game I willingly choose to play with a controller is DS2 and that is only because I don't want to completely rewrite my muscle memory to play it, otherwise KBM is better for it as well
            Why is keyboard & mouse harder?

(Here from r/all. Never played a Souls game.)
                The controls are just designed around it. Rotating the camera around the player works better as an analog stick rather than mouse and analog sticks can have movement input possibilities that are more than just a digital (0 or 1) input of up/down/left/right.

Handling items and stuff are also probably easier on controller d-pad, but it's probably not bad on keyboard.

The biggest thing though is that FromSoft games did not work well for keyboard and mouse for a very long time. Dark Souls 1 on PC required a fan patch (DS Fix) to work. DS2 may have also. I think 3 worked out of the box, but it wasn't ideal. The game's community has grown up around the understanding controller is ideal, even on PC. Even if that perception is incorrect now (idk if it is), it's going to take a long time to change.
                    Handling items is significantly easier on keyboard IMO, and a [trackball mouse](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61QrqZ8uurL._AC_SL1500_.jpg) handles the camera better than the analog stick does

                It’s not necessarily, it comes down to preference. If someone has played the previous games on all console, a controller probably feels better. Some people really excel in games with KB+M.
                Keyboard inputs are all or nothing, which isn't great for finer control that these games typically require. Some people make it work.
            He's also doing it with his feet.  While blindfolded.  Guided only by the sounds of her attacks.
            Looks like a mouse cursor to select emotes too. I bet they're using a goddamn keyboard and mouse
            Tbh I played all Souls games with KB+M and it's better for me imho, especially the camera control, free aiming spells and bows, attacks without lock-on etc. 

Also, being able to change key binding to suit your needs and engaging more fingers helps. I found using controller very limiting, only exception beibg analog stick for movement but that isn't hard to work around with camera-relative controls.
    Her getting naked in the second phase is just her attempting to rise up to his level.
        This is now canon to me.
            The anime internal monologue be like:

"Wh-wh-what?! How can this be possible? He's so powerful he doesn't even need to wear *armor?*

...or is my armor holding me back from fighting at his power level?! That must be it... well I'll show *him* how powerful fighting naked *REALLY IS!*"
        Very impressive, Malenia, but can you *hang dong*?!

Halfway through first phase the host and summon finally backed off like *yeah he’s about to fuck her up*
    Honestly it's a hindrance. If she stays focused on one person, it's easier to learn her attack patterns and the proper dodge timing. As soon as you add more players to the mix, it's a lot more unpredictable.
        [deleted]
            Try throwing knives or a bow. Even a small hit can sometimes pull aggro back to you.

                    If you've got frost pots you can knock her out of waterfowl dance 2x in the fight before she's immune
            The agro talisman doesn't work?
        For the majority of hosts it would be easier to just solo the boss. But I don't think that's something most phantoms (fingers) are interested in, it's not a boosting service. There's also the other phantom dying early, leaving you with a buffed boss.

For Malenia specifically it's not uncommon for the host to have no idea how to deal with Waterfowl and Scarlet Aeonia. Or even worse, they use a greatshield and try to "help". Even running in-between when I'm dodging Waterfowl, healing her to full health.
        Hence spirit ashes sometimes making some bosses harder lol. It's always really hard to dodge an attack that isn't actually aimed at you...
    When I'm really, REALLY getting schooled by a boss and summon someone, I do my part by sitting back and throwing black fireballs at them unless the summon(s) are clearly fighting in a way that indicates they want me in the thick of it with my sword and board too.

Worked wonders for Mali...Male...black armor dog man with sword. You best believe when phase two started and he did that flippy shit, my ass was ducking behind pillars any time he looked at me and only peeking out long enough to throw a fireball and then duck back when he was pressuring the summon and they needed time to heal. I was not ashamed to be a coward for that fight. The dude I summoned knew how to dodge all that flippy bullshit and I did not lol.

This dude gets maidens
People would rather throw hours at a boss than be patient for 10 minutes, myself included

Good work
    But I am committed to charging in with a jump attack!
    eh. some of those attacks clearly required learned timing rather than just pure reflexes and patience.
        I think the patience really comes into play when knowing to pull back. Everyone is guilty of trying to get that one more attack in the combo that they know they shouldn't try for and then gets hit. I know i do that far more than i should.
            This.  I haven't even played this game and I kept going "One more swing!!!!" knowing that I couldn't have resisted and would have gotten smacked for it.
                Bruh what are you doing? Play the damn game!
                    It's on the list man.  Don't get old, it sucks, you don't have time for anything fun.
        I think the point is that people would rather bang their head against the boss until they beat it themselves, even if it takes hours, than watch somebody else do it for you in 10 minutes. Just how I interpreted it though.
            Could also be people trying to finish the fight in 5 minutes instead of taking their time and only attacking at the proper openings.
                FromSoft combat is a dance. Step at the right time, and the fight is effortless. Miss your cue and you're getting your foot stepped on.
    That's my take away here, just keep your distance and only attack after she does a certain attack.  Not gonna lie wasn't as exciting as I'd hope.
        Half of the late game bosses are just waiting for them to finally stop attacking and reading your inputs so you can get a hit in. Malenia would have been so fun in sekiro where you actually get tools for dealing with endless boss strings
            >Half of the late game bosses are just waiting for them to finally stop attacking 

And the final boss is simply running towards it for a chance to hit it for 95% of the fight.
        doesnt look that exciting but it sure is in when you are the one doing it.
            That's the best feeling. When I finally figured out the crucible knight, it felt so damn good being able to beat him with minimal flask usage. But I get so impatient much of the time and rush in, then die and get pissed that I'm losing rune arcs.

    All of her waterfowl dance attack can be evaded consistently! :D
        Can you share how do you roll that there? EVERY other close ranged dodge I have seen have people use unlock running bait to bait her into dashing futher at the wrong direction but you are just rolling through it without unlocking. 

Is the second roll forward or backwards? Is that an instant roll after the first? Can it be done with mid roll?
            [This guy shows you how to do it at the end of the vid.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fTOm2H5PUs) w/ controller display.

The timing is very specific for it and I don't think you can do it without light load.

I tried it and died instantly lol so there is some modicum of still needing to git gud.
                I have done it a single time at medium through dumb luck, so it is definitely doable, but incredibly difficult.
                    Removing the lock on helps with medium roll, but its still incredibly hard
                [deleted]
                    Unlocking and run bait in circle is the most common way to avoid but also the hardest to do so not what we are talking about here.
    Right, why is no one talking about it? It's the cleanest close range evade of it I've seen so far. Proves that it can be dodged in a normal fashion, i.e. rolls, but I wonder how consistent it is.
THE LEGEND HAS GRACED US! PRAISE BE TO YE JAR HEADED MAN! Thank you!
[deleted]
    I was going for a no hit run so I was being extra careful. But in this run I believe all my attacks were timed so I wouldnt get punished ^^
Do you encounter people who don't want you to solo her? I usually want the people I summon to be a little shitty lol but I know it's not really under my control.

This is extremely impressive, I don't think I could ever manage something like this with a thousand tries.
    I mean, to be fair you can see people's names. If you don't want them to solo the boss, maybe don't summon "Let Me Solo Her"
        Yeah but you have to click the summon sign before you see who it is or you'll get unable to summon, so someone might not be able to read and process before they've clicked to invite.
How am I suppose to git gud when this guy already took all of the gud
    Nowadays we can only rent gud from those who already got it.
Omg I feel like I'm meeting a celebrity. Get a PS5 and solo her for me king!
    I don’t even need the help, I just want to watch him
Bro saw his name come up and made the post lmao epic
It's worth noting the boss has extra health in a triple summon and these two patiently let this happen. Great bating technique and distance management here.
I think I met a counterfeit one, he was called "Malenia Killer." He died to the 1st Malenia combo.

    Dude is straight up playing with a colossal weapon build, but while naked with katanas and no weapon arts. One can merely shudder what what his fully unlocked power would be.
Are you seriously telling me you're playing with mouse & keyboard and soloing this boss?
    I only play with mouse and keyboard :)
        I don't know how anyone can play this type of game without a controller lol its just so made for it.
            I bought an Xbox controller to play it with after trying it on mouse & keyboard. So much better
            I can't use a controller to play these games! The camera control is horrible! I played Sekiro, DS3 and now Elden Ring with M&K
You sir are truly the Elden Lord!
You play on mouse and keyboard???

How are you slow walking btw?
    Alt key!
He is the child of prophecy!
Of all the people who have summoned you,  what percentage let you solo her?
    Id say it's 70 percent that read my name and lets me solo her. If not it's all good and we still cheese her >:)
What a sick way to fight, eh.
The bodies of Miquella and Melnias soldiers litter the Haligtree like a toddlers discarded toys; oddly befitting the unaging Demi Gods home. One brave Tarnished stands before the very roots of the ancient tree, ready to face down one of the realms greatest warriors in combat; when a hand is placed upon his shoulder. He turns to see a naked man with a jar on his head. 'Let me solo her' is all he says before entering the arena of the Rot Queen.

It was at that moment, watching this strange creature best Malenia that the Tarnished knew he could never sit upon the Elden Throne. It was not meant for him; nor anyone else. Save this monster before him.
It’s him…the legend. Malenia’s worst nightmare.
A true legend. I was not one helped by thee, but I will not forget thy tale, nonetheless. Truly, you are one fit to become Elden Lord.
This is an incredibly interesting insight into the fights mechanics and I think I’ve realized what makes Malenia so hard: she baits the player. 

She isn’t a super aggressive boss and spends long periods walking around. What she’s doing is waiting for the player to either heal, cast a spell, or go in for a melee attack which she will then punish. But by staying at mid range and doing NOTHING the player can bait HER into one of her combos, which can be dodged easier due to the increased range between them and be punished. Basically, unless she has just missed you with a combo, don’t do anything.

Apologies if this was obvious to anyone else, but this mad man is what made me realize this.
I’m no simp…but I’m at your service, my Elden Lord https://i.imgur.com/ziG5eex.jpg
Would you mind doing a demo with a heavier weapon? Im really struggling with blasphemous blade. I feel like I hit her and then get waterfowled for it.

Also is light load a nessecity?
    I'll experiment with other weapons soon!
        Thanks brother.

The true Elden Lord has come forth
This guy is the canon Elden Lord. The rest of us are fanfiction.
Once I get an official copy of the game I’d love to summon you for her! 

Btw, she *that* hard? I keep hearing how hard she is but at this point I’m too scared to ask lmao
    Oh buddy... You have no idea what awaits you lol
    The waterfowl dance she does is *very* hard to dodge consistently. If you don't dodge it perfectly or have a shield that can eat it, it will kill you at 50 Vigor. And every time she hits you (shield included) she heals.
    This man has atleast 100 hours put in to learning this specific fight with that build. She is incredibly difficult to stun, she heals when she hits you, she has 2 phases (not many bosses do), attacks incredibly quickly with very little telegraphing, produces scarlet rot, moves incredibly quickly, and the area has no pillars or anything to hide behind.

If that doesnt scare you then I dont what will
        She actually is pretty easy to stun. She has pretty poor poise and you really only need to beat on her a bit to stun her. The hard part is getting the opportunity, but I would regularly knock her to her knees in phase 1.
    From what I seen, never get to her yet. But she never let her do your 3rd attack nor backstab her. So no crits I guess.

But I am noob at that game.
        She's actually easy to break through poise if you go oonga boonga.  Crit several times over the fight.
    She kinda is. Took me almost 3 hours before I killed her. I dont get how builds and magic works and all I had regular twinblade, had a mimic with same thing. 

From side it looked like Maul and Savage fighting Sidius from SW clone wars.
    Unless you’re this guy… yes she is
Praise be
Did you once hail by the name "Let Me Solo the Boss"?
From now on out, the term "pothead" shall be a compliment!
Malenia has the same reaction to you as we do to her on our 100th try.
“ This fucking guy.” 

Well done, mate. Absolutely brilliant.
If I see a nude guy with a bare first and a heavily loaded guy with something like scythe on the summon signs, I always summon the nude guy.
Unbelieveable. A souls player who uses his bragging rights for good instead of talking shit on others!
Alright what's so impressive about this is that the keyboard inputs started popping up when you first loaded in. So you're soloing Male is on a mouse and keyboard??
My god it’s so simple. To keep melania from healing herself all you have to do is not get hit. Why didn’t I think I this?
Do you have a tiktok by chance? There is someone going by the name of “letmesolomalenia” claiming to be you and got caught using cheats on his live streams.
    I do not have a tiktok and have not done any streams
        I assumed that, I dont know if this is something you really care about but he is profiting off of pretending to be you, just wanted to make sure you were aware!
            Thank you for the heads up, Stay safe out there!

Crazy how he dodges waterfowl dance the exact way I tried to tell people to dodge her and I actually got down voted by some for trying to teach them. But this move is “Unavoidable”
I’m so glad I opened Reddit lol
Please do a tutorial video!
    This was a tutorial video. Amazing skill
    Don't try to interrupt her, she has high poise and most of her combos don't actually end when they do because she can sort of animation cancel into other combos.

Basically, her phase 1 is simple:

Regular swings: dodge.

Quick three hits in rapid succession: dodge back if you are mid range and dodge to close to her sides if you are close range.

Kick is unsafe. Dont try to punish.

Quick three hits in rapid succession with a 4th finisher swing: _PUNISH__

grab: dodge to the side

Jump attack into air with downward attack upon landing: punish during windup if you use fast weapons, if str build don't even try that.... wait till she lands to punish. Out of her entire kit, this is the safest one to punish.

Side dodge attack: dodge back.

Waterfowl dance: arguably the most busted move in her entire arsenal, this thing is impossible to whiff on her part. Either block it, dodge it, or die.

But how to dodge it? If you see her raise up into the air with the sword raised in front of her face in a bracing position, immediately run away from her. If you maintain mid range distance from her, when she does this animation it should get you enough distance to force her to miss the first part entirely. *if you missed your chance to run because you got greedy or if you mistook her animations... then the first part of this chain is very hard to dodge properly. I recommend blocking with a greatshield if you can't get the timing down. I wish I could tell you how to dodge that, but it's really not something I can put into words. You just gotta learn the timing*

The second part, visually is when there is a very slight pause in between the first few slashes and then she spins again and slashes some more. When she does this, if you managed to dodge the first part, dodge into her to force her attack to go past you, time the dodge with the start of her new slashing chain. *if you blocked or got hit by the first chain. Try to stay calm even though she just ate 90% of your health or stamina. You can recover by the second part of the dance, just dodge into her. Time the dodge with the start up of her chain and you should force her to miss.*

The last part of her dance, punctuated by another slight pause... is the same as her second. Dodge into her, but at an angle, so she travels forward and away from you. Then dodge again as the slashes have a wide aoe, you might not have enough distance so the age slashing might still catch you if you accidently walk toward her, or if you underestimate the aoe size.

Then the flurrish finisher. Wait to punish until she lands and the final circle of slashes ends.

During her phase 2:

During the big scarlet aoe flower... run under her, and she should miss. Careful not to try and get close during the scarlet blooming. It can kill you fairly easily. This attack is punishable if you use range. I recommend swarm of flies or comet Azur.

She gains new moves during phase 2 and is more aggressive.

She floats in mid air, you cannot melee her, she can do 1 of two attacks while in the air.

1.) Clone versions of herself to attack in alternating pattern. Dodge opposite the side of the clone direction. 

2.) Fly down and toward you in an arc pattern, almost immediately on landing she stabs at you. Dodge both and this is deceptively fast, so try to dodge without waiting for a big windup.

She also generates explosions on some attacks and those can build up scarlet rot.

Hope this helps, I know it's just words and not an actual video, but hopefully you can find some use in them when you get the hang of her animations and patterns.

Malenia is actually wrong about that, bleed works brilliantly. The other option is to parry which is also easy. I used buckler and dagger and it worked well. I hate her silly combo tho. I don't think I'll ever consistently dodge that.
I beat her but it was so chaotic I never realized in her second form those little incantation thingy’s were her thrusts. I was just rolling around praying my endurance held

        Theres no reason i took this obviously rhetorical question so seriously but definitely overcome scrub nature. You'll eventually meet your match one day, and if you have experience to fall back on, youll be all the more capable. Being born gud is being born with a blind spot you wont know until its game over.

I'll never claim to be actually good at the game, but I did beat it and I'll take that.
        Dude, that was my build too. Melania was still tough, but the Elden Best was just frustrating. Hoping it’s better on my unga bunga play through
            Want to know the trick for unga-bunga Elden Beast? It's called Fallingstar Beast Jaw.

Yeah, you'll have to invest a lil' bit of int to use it, or just boost it with gear, however, the weapon art on this thing trivializes any boss encounter you might have problem with. Just summon your Mimic, stand there and smack someone with lightning until they die. Gravity Bolt staggers bosses in like 3-4 casts, does massive damage, costs little to no FP and can be chain-casted real quick. Certified cheese right there.

The other option is if you don't want to invest any int - and it's Flame of the Redmanes. Get this bad boy, slap it on any heavy bonk stick you might want to use, steamroll through the game. Takes a bit to cast, costs more FP than Gravity Bolt, but staggers like no tomorrow. You can stagger pretty much anything in up to 3 casts, walk up, crit, repeat.
                Eleanoras pole blade is also great if you want to have a stagger party.  It has a godlike weapon art that does insane poise damage, stacks bleed, is super mobile and is one of the most fun weapon arts to use IMO.
                    That thing also gives you poise and I-frames, it's insane.
                    Yeah, it's not a big bonk stick though. Therefore, no unga bunga, and no unga bunga = no fun.
                    I looove Eleonora's so much. Bloodblade Dance is the guddest I can hit 😂
                Boy, it's a good thing I boosted every special weapon to +9 because I think this one will actually get some use from me now!
                    Yeah, I'm doing a "magical bonk" build, currently dual-wielding Royal Greatswords at NG+2 while going for every ending, and while my trusty ultras are usually enough, I keep that Cheesingstar Beast Jaw in my pocket for especially annoying fights.
            It's not, you spend half the time running after it.
                And then by the time you catch it, all your stamina is gone so you can’t even get the max hits in before it runs away again
                    And the distances you had to run! It was SO FAR AWAY, and when you reached it half the time it was instantly in the sky or on the other side again. Why wasnt the arena at least a little smaller?
            I found the unga-bunga fine. Here's my history:

My first character was a blocky-boy. I held my shield up and took light chip damage to everything Radagon and Beast could do (except grabs, had to fatroll the grabs to save a flask charge). He did up to NG+2 without me having to learn Radagon's moveset in the least, just equipped a Fingerprint shield, the scaled set, and anything thrusting.

My second character was a giga-bonk (dual colossal maces) unga build and beat the game with them at \~level 100-115. I was really worried about never learning Radagon before. Here's a hint, his face hates being smashed. Actually, everything seemed to hate having their faces smashed in by 4 colossal hammers. I don't know if I landed a single dodge on him, I just spammed jump-smash until he hit me, let my mimic grab aggro and flasked. Then resumed jump-smashing. I had 10 flask charges total, at +5. I used 7 charges on Radagon.

Elden Beast was weak to bonk too. I whiffed three of his 4-hit holy slash combo (again, I've never dodged before) and had to heal up from 5% HP, but he died really fast and didn't get to do very much. If you can do the ring jump once or twice, that's all it takes (hint for melee, run directly away from where he air-twirlies. He will resurface directly in front of you after you jump the ring. Bonk his brains out, *unload that stamina bar in his stupid swimming face hole*.)
            I was so frustrated on elden beast then I equipped pearldrake talisman +2 and haligdrake talisman +2 and it was so much better. You can also mix a wondrous physick to absorb non physical damage and damage from a spell. All this made me beat Elden Beast first try in NG+ after struggling without
            [deleted]
                Same. Rip on magic all you want, but I’m out here healing, swinging giant frost greatswords, cosplaying goku, sniping enemies with a greatbow, raining down meteors and hellfire, and shooting a fucking moon at my enemies. It’s so much fun that I don’t care if it’s not the true souls experience.
            Elden Beast feels lika a fight designed to be fought on horse... It's not that difficult, IMO, but so fucking annoying to keep running after it
        For me I beat Elden beast by using the Radagon cheese where you run up on him right after loading in with a light load and spam carian slicer on him without staggering him while he doesn’t move. On the last hit throw on that one talisman that keeps aggro on you and summon your mimic tear then replace the talisman with whatever it was before. Get to elden beast and use bloodhound’s step on your right weapon and rock sling w/ meteorite staff in your left. Some good rng just made it a waiting game for him to die and some staggers kept my mimic alive. 27 faith for the holy damage negation spell was also a godsend. 


I don’t feel bad at all about circumcising radagon. Tried the fight normally around 30ish times and did fine on him but could barely ever get Elden beast to half. It’s just a horrible fight all around for a melee build.
            I’m happy for you, or sorry that happened. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m about to face the Elden Beast for the 200th time. This ones it, I can feel it.
                [deleted]
                    Stop. Come back tomorrow and suddenly and inexplicably one shot him. This is the way.
                    That’s happened to me a few times over the last week with Fire Giant. I’ll get him soon. I can taste it.
                Don't forget to come back and let us celebrate with you when you win!
                I have a Faith built using a sacred hammer and longsword along with the brass shield. 

Radagon phase: summoned Tiche (black flame does wonders on gods), was about shield and counterattacks, along with matching talismans (curved sword, crimson assassin...). Very important: I used the divine protection, the one provided by Sir Gideon Ofnir after being defeated, it significantly lowers the damage taken.

Beast phase: divine protection cast, then switching to Radagon's Icon, the incantation buff talisman, close up and using the pest's needles incantation. It obliterates huge enemies taking all the needles (works very nicely with dragons as well). The rest of the time, I run away from the Elden stars and huge aoe, and keep on raising my shield when getting close to it.

You'll block holy at 98.7%, and what gets through won't hurt to much.  Last run on NG6, I used 1 heal pot for the encounter, and I'm no amazing gamer.
            I had trouble at first with the elden beast with melee. Then I found spamming strong attacks after it does it's 3 hit swipe with the sword will almost always guarantee a stagger.
        Dad gamer here. I over leveled to 160 str/fai and used toot flute on elden beast. I just want to get high in the evenings and fuck around with bosses and cool spells/skills.
        You can basically skip everything before you say 'over-level' and just do that with any build. Over levelling guarantees success simply because you put in the effort to grind instead of trying to immediately get on the level of broken sword only runs because of the mental gymnastics and pressure the community pumps out about gitting gud and beating the game with as many handicaps as possible. These games are about winning by any means and playing how you want, so there's no shame no matter what you do.
         No hate on people who do use that build but I hate the thought of having to change my build just for a boss. Every souls game I've played my first run has been a faith/strength build and by god I will beat my paladin head against every brick wall this game has
This guy reminds me of a dude back when WoW first came out. A player named Swampy, an orc warrior, he would hang out at the Barrens flight point area and help newbs and fight off alliance gankers. A true hero.
    Which server was that on? Had a similar dude, then I did the same as a lvl 60 undead rogue waaaay back in the day. Just walk up and one shot things then dance for them.
        Angwe? The most legendary vanilla rogue in wow?
            Angwe was an Orc a menace of the harbor. I wished I was that much of a ganker.
This guy is the absolute guddest. 

Look at his flasks, he doesn't even need the shit.
They have to be naked to not be overencumbered by their enormous dong
"Why wear armour if you're not planning on getting hit?"

50% per person. So she would have double the HP for 2 summons
    Wow I'd forgotten, makes this even more impressive @.@
It is indeed.
    apparently skill scales harder than HP
        Just don't get hit 🤷‍♂️
            well shit, I've been playing all wrong

Click on their heads lmao.

            What if getting hit is part of my skill?
        [deleted]
She also heals every time she hits you and her flurry of attacks is rather difficult to dodge consistently. I beat her but not after she whooped my ass for about an hour.
    In the video OP doesn't get hit a single time, including during the Waterfowl Dance she uses twice (though not at all in phase 2). She can't heal if she doesn't hit you...
        Why did her health bar look all janky when she gets hit? Looked she was getting hit, healing some dam then getting hit again.
            Lag, possibly.
            Just standard FromSoft multiplayer jank lol.
            Coop lag.
        As a melee character who’s no where near as good as OP, while I’m very much aware if I avoid getting hit she can’t heal, she just does.
            OP dodges her blade, while most of us guide ourselves into it.
                I have mastered the art of becoming one with the blade
                    ... just not my own.
        It's a good showcase as to how one can dodge the Waterfowl Dance, both when further away (first time) and when directly under her (second time). I keep seeing comments saying it is actually impossible to dodge that attack etc. and I think it will be helpful to learn the dodge timing he uses. Because once you figured the fight out (arguably before that aswell but anyways), it is imo one of or the greatest fight in the game. Gives one the amazing duel kind of feeling when playing solo melee!
            His close range dodge is only possible because of light roll, medium roll needs a even tighter frame to dodge and you might need to run closely around her while she's in the air (haven't tried medium roll with his technique yet)
    Tip: dont get hit
        Shit I knew I was fucking something up

You can summon Alexander as a cooperator. His summon sign is a golden patch in the snow just past the fog door, easy to miss
    Nice, didn’t realize this.  I imagine I’ll need to do his quest first.  Is it too late?
        I think so. I met him at the Radahn Festival then again like at the magma fields area to get him unstuck. Not sure what's the precise requirement tho
            I missed him in Limgrave, saw him at the festival, and saw him in the magma fields and I was able to use him in the Fire Giant fight so you can 100% skip the Limgrave one it seems.
                His quest is very forgiving. He appears generally in this order:

>!Limgrave, Gael Tunnel, Radahn, Liurnia, Mt. Gelmir, Fire Giant, and Farum Azula!<

I actually accidentally skipped him in Liurnia and still managed to finish his quest. So I would assume the important ones are probably >!Radahan, Mt Gelmir, and Farum Azula.!< That would be my guess. You do miss out on a few items if you don’t meet him and help him get unstuck.
                ^ this

In fact this is my exact experience in my playthrough actually. Was then able to complete his questline after that, in the next area past the Fire Giant.
                In 4 of 5 play throughs he hasn’t even shown up in Liurnia for me, after the festival I only find him in Mt. Gelmir after that. Once I’ve seen him in Liurnia.
            He is not stuck in the lava stream. He is in there by choice. It isn't hot enough to "temper" him, however, so he seeks the giant's flame. That's why you meet him in the fire giant's boss room.
                You are right, thanks for the clarification. Had momentarily forgotten the details by this point.
            I met him in limgrave and got him unstuck but I don’t think I’ve seen him since.
                Hmm, assuming you have beaten Radahn he may still be at Radahn's site of grace. Fextra says his dialogue here needs to be exhausted before he will move on to other places.

Full article for the other locations afterwards: https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Iron+Fist+Alexander
                Not sure how far you are, but you can complete his quest basically at any time it seems.

Avoiding spoilers, you see him again for the Radahn Festival in Caelid. He'll then go train somewhere hot, to temper himself. You can meet him again near a giant sky pot, inside a boss arena (as a summon). Finally, you can see him in a swirly crumbly timey wimy zone.

I think he pops up a few other places too, but those seem like the most story important places to find him.
                Probably 
>!talk to him at radahns’ arena may not be necessary but exhaust dialogue!<
>!find him stuck again in luirnia need oil pot. Recipe book sold by merchant in siofra river ( up scaffolding in the middle he’s hidden above the flower)!<
>!also jairburn (not sure if that’s right but jar town) is near there so look around!<
>!will find him near a fort in Mt. gelmir behind a lava wyrm!<
Should be available for fire giant at this point I believe.
        Hm. Maybe? He may still be stuck in the ground. Or he could be in the battlefield after the radahn fight
            Stuck in the ground in Liurnia but it’s overlooking the jar people town on top of the cliff. Need an oil pot and preferably but not required a colossal weapon
                I never found him there, but still managed to summon him for Fire Giant and then complete his questline shortly after.
        Look up his questline, you'll likely be able to find where he is in your current playthrough
        If you haven't beaten the giant you might still be in time, you need to follow his quest line until you find him after a magma wyrm in Mt Gelmir. If you're too late I still encourage you to follow his quest line since in the end you get a very useful talisman.
        If I may offer a suggestion, I used Torrent the whole time. I’d zip in, get a hit or two on his ankle, and zip out. You can outrun/dodge any attack except his wave attack (puts plate in grounds and throws upwards, spraying ice/rocks in a cone). Don’t run too far so he doesn’t use this attack. 

For his 2nd phase, same idea. It’s tough to get his forearms at a good time so just zip in, poke his no-leg, and forearms when available.
        Keep in mind, there's two entrances to the Fire Giant arena, his summon sign is only at one of those.
    I really don't recommend summoning him, as it will disable Torrent, and fighting the giant just on foot is very hard.
        I have heard that, and that phase 2 of the Giant fight on horseback becomes trivial. Hasn't been my experience at all, but admittedly I'm much more comfortable fighting on foot even after all those dragons & tree sentinels. Conversely I felt the fight was much easier with Alexander and his excellent tankiness & aggro-drawing. So I guess ones mileage may vary.
            I wouldn't say Torrent trivialized phase 2, but it certainly made it easier to avoid some projectiles and reposition for the floaty Sun spells. My mimic lasted just long enough for me to play patiently with Torrent for the last 20% health. Everyone's boss experiences differ, love that about these games.
            True enough! I've actually had more trouble with the Giant than other late game bosses, even with Torrent. But everyone has their own style.
        i actually found the fight way easier not suing the horse
            Horse litigation
                Let’s go toe-to-toe on horse law and see who comes out the victor.
            Me too. Easier to stay under him and cling close to his legs
    Tiche is the best for that fight because her Destined Death will burn a lot of hp away for you
    "A golden patch in the snow" you say? I was always taught to stay away from those but I'll have to check that out.
I don't understand how some people are so good at video games. There is a modded boss for Hollow Knight called Any Radiance that was made to be the hardest boss imaginable, and of course, three people have done it without taking damage. I will never understand how people get this good, no matter what I do I make the same mistakes over and over and only beat hard bosses by getting lucky.
    I think my biggest takeaway from this video is that this guy is patient. It's not easy to be patient.
        As I was watching I was constantly pointing out moments I would've jumped in to attack Melania and they did not.
            Seems he had really only 2 or three attacks he knew he could safely go in after. The rest of the time he was just avoiding damage which is tricky enough. 

It's almost like it's possible other attacks are also ok to counter but more risky so why try for them. Wait for the best ones. Dodge the rest. Once you learn the broadcasts, I guess that's the full package. 

That and not being a spaz which is always my problem.
                See what I do is an advanced technique you probably haven’t heard of. I do the exact same thing except I decide to just face tank a hit in exchange for a morsel of damage which causes me to miss all those openings because I’m busy getting stabbed during my sip. A true gamer strat that only worked thanks to the power of way too much vigor lmfao
                The absolute discipline is truly impressive.  That and his god-tier evasion of the Waterfowl dance point blank, plus the clone spam that got me so many times.

Then again, I guess if I fought Melania as much as this dude has, I might be better at it.
                    The point blank waterfowl dodge had my mouth wide open. I didnt know you could even pull that off. I had seen people do it when they were ready and do the run away and redirect but from point blank? Amazing.
                        I've seen people do it in a couple of videos, sometimes it looks like they just roll blindly and get lucky, but this was clearly an intentional and perfectly executed dodge.
                            With multiplayet latency no less.
                A good way to practice is to literally just avoid their attacks as long as you can without going for a hit. Make it muscle memory. I think there's a difference in viewing the fight from someone like OP. A lot of people focus on when to attack, when they should be focusing on when to avoid. So it just becomes a battle of impatience, where you're itching to attack them and end up attacking at an inopportune time.

I'm still working my way through the game, and trying to have more patience. I've been doing mediocre.
                That was my strategy for Margit, and Manus from DS1, stand back and bait out the punishable attacks
                Yeah, he played really safe, which is risky in it's own way (the fight last longer)
                Think the ideais you don't know what comes next after her shorter attacks, if it's another short attack you'll get hit. Prob better to wait for attacks with a guaranteed cooldown.

In her 2nd form she seems to emit a short explosion for attacks with cooldowns, which is a nice tell.

Also, dude can even parry her sword attacks, did it in another run.

Edit: ah wait it wasn't this guy, it was MoonMoon who was parrying her attacks. He's a streamer I was watching beat the game at soul lv. 1. Was using a shield + katana for this fight.
            It's that patience to wait, like when you know they are just one or two hits, that separate the wheat from the Chad's.
                I've been playing these since Demons Souls on PS3. Still can't resist the allure of trying to get in one more hit.
        Yeah, we have COUNTLESS threads shitposting about Greatswords and Colossals being shit and gimping you in hard boss fights because your moveset gets restricted to just 3 moves + Weapon Art. Yet here's a guy relying most on just a jump attack and a follow-up R1 slash and doesn't even use bloodhound a single time. 

Patience is the real super power.
        MoonMoon beat her last night with a level 1 toon. It took like 12+ hours of attempts. Basically just perseverance.
    I have so much time into Hollow Knight, and I did everything except for the like... Godseeker? Is that what it's called? And NKG. and of course the Radiance fight. I survived everything else only to get my ass handed to me by Radiance over and over and over. I can't imagine there being a harder version of this fight. And people beating it with no damage. I won't even touch steel soul. Nope. Can not make it far without dying. 

I thought I was a gamer. Then the internet showed me I suck. 😅 Oh well. It's fun.
        There's an interesting video discussing how ridiculous the fight is and the fact that people beat it anyway https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kkGaF2vs8o
            No idea about that game, but it was a very entertaining video. Thanks for sharing.
            tuned in for a few minutes.. watched the whole hour.
        There's actually already a harder version of the Radiance fight in the unmodded game (along with several other new bosses) in Godhome, the boss rush area associated with the Godseeker. She's called Absolute Radiance, and she is harder than anything else in the game by an order of magnitude. Plus, in order to get the Godhome ending, you have to beat her at the end of a boss rush that includes *every other boss in the game* first.

Getting that victory is probably my single proudest gaming achievement.
            Amen. That’s my platinum trophy sitting on the top shelf above all others. The rush. The absolute rush of finally killing her after so many times getting so close. The only other moment from a video game that can beat even souls boss victory rush.
            I bet that was an amazing feeling. I couldn't handle some of the beefed up bosses in Godhome. I got there. I checked the place out. Made it through some of the rushes and some of the simpler challenges. But nah, definitely not good enough at HK to make it through that content. 😅 I was proud enough of what I did accomplish. You though. Take an upvote and my mad respect.
    Totally,  also since your inputs get stored if you do an extra input is enough to ruin the whole fight, I always roll( panic roll) more that I want or do that extra unnecessary attack(greed attack) that fucks it all up.
    Tangentially related, I think I saw one of the most skillful plays of a game ever yesterday. Not a boss, but a kaizo mario run.

First I watched the videos that arguably popularized kaizo mario: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2A4C8FFD54A1AA10

These videos show a friend of the level designer play through his romhack. Superbly edited videos, showing every death, excellently communicating the feelings of the player without wasting your time and by only showing gameplay.

Then I watched this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv5Lpzzjf6s

I think another category of incredible is the blindfolded sekiro speedruns (just search youtube for it)
What stood out to me was the patience and restraint. Waiting out attack after attack until the brief moment of vulnerability, executing the same combo or a single hit, then backing off and waiting again. I’m starting to think that panicked flailing might not be the angle I should take…
    Exactly this. I've just started with DS2, so I'm not gud yet, but watching this video I thought of all the times I tried to sneak just one more attack on a boss, even though I know the window is closing. I try to make the fight faster that way, but instead I just make it go many times longer having to repeat it over and over.
    I haven't played Elden Ring but have watched tons of streamers play it. What I've noticed is that everyone loved the game when it came out. And then they started reaching the end game bosses and they all kind of hated them. And this is why. They only have one or two attacks that allow for counter attacks. It doesn't really make for a good boss fight.

I watched that whole video and it's basically just dodging everything she does waiting for her to do the one attack that is safe to counter attack.
        There are plenty of opportunities for aggression and counter attacks, Malenia is just fairly punishing if you go too far. This guy was even more careful than necessary though and he was able to do it no-hit, but if you aren't trying for that specific challenge, you should easily be relatively fine being more aggressive than him.

Lots of streamers are whiny man-children. Don't take their opinions on boss fights as gospel.
    Same here. Such restraint and zen from that guy. She kept leaving fake openings that I would have rushed like an idiot but he always waited for her attack to finish then hit twice and left. Dodge back from her sword and sideways for projectiles. Amazing
What’s your build? I did it with my ruins great sword. Took a while but ALWAYS being behind him and on Torrent and smackin the nub worked for me
    Smackin the NUB
        Lil stump getting straight bonked
    Using Margott’s cursed sword with Dex 40, Arc ~20, and Vig 40.  I’ve gotten him to around 20% health on one of my better runs but can’t quite finish him.
        Is it the double shot of the straight fireballs that gets you? Cause of that's the case roll forward last second or run for cover. 

Only reason I guess that is because that's what majority of my hosts die to 

Otherwise...

If it's the slow moving balls just run near them then away and they whiff every time. 

If it's melee attacks, all I can say is timing. 

If it's his big ass rolls, stick to right left as he mostly seems to go to his left. 

And it should never be the firestorm that gets you, classing "don't stand on the red circles" mechanic
        Ahhh. I’m like pure str/vig besides some dex+ stuff to wield ruins.
Remember that the boss had 2 coop increased health as well
Fire Giant took me forever, got it finally with mimic summon, and upgraded blade of rot and reduvia. Just bled and rotted him. Took a long ass time, but worked better than my great swords.
While I totally agree with the sentiment I would like to caution against going fully into this mentality. Believe I could be as good as the video was source of so much physical stress over the years. Dont beat yourself up over mistakes you make just because someone else wouldn't have made that mistake. They made it at some point and learned how to not make it in the future

    A bit unrelated, but I have to ask, is it just me, or is this madman fighting her using keyboard + mouse? 

I just noticed in the video that all the button prompts are for the keyboard and not a controller. I swear, if they are, it's just another layer of impressiveness on top of how impressed I already am…

Edit: since I'm getting questions about the difference between using KB+M and a controller for these games from folks who have never played them, as a brief explanation, using a controller is generally more intuitive as the movement is designed around having control via analog sticks, as opposed to a limited set of directional inputs that generally comes with the keyboard (i.e. up/down/left/right), as well as limited space to move your mouse around depending on your setup. As someone who previously played using both KB+M and controller in previous games, I can also say that using KB+M can also be tricky with the bindings and personally took me much longer to adapt to than using a controller.

The other issue is that historically the souls games have had very poor implementation for KB+M; in fact, in DS1 I recall that it required a fan to create a patch to get it to even work. I personally can tell you that it was not a fun time trying to learn keyboard/mouse controls in the previous games and that ultimately a controller was a much easier and more intuitive choice. That being said, I'm now being told that apparently the KB+M implementation is actually pretty good in Elden Ring, so perhaps From finally figured out what they were doing. I'll personally be sticking with the controller, though.

            Wait until everyone finds out it’s actually a guitar hero guitar configured to keyboard inputs instead of controller.

                            There is a YouTuber who is doing Elden Ring on the Donkey Kong bongos! ZeroLenny 😂
            Does it with a million souls in the bag without getting hit too. I'm guessing he does this _a lot_
                Furled Fingers don't lose souls when they die!
                He wouldn't lose them if he died anyway...
        I'd almost wager it's a benefit in a fight like this where you can more quickly change direction of motion to get away from the first burst of waterfowl dance, but this is like 95% this guy being an absolute unit and having her moveset memorized.
        I dont think kb + mouse are as bad as ppl say they are. I beat her with them.
            Yeah I use kb+m I dont know why people think it's so bad

                    I know I remapped the change spells to one of my mouse buttons since hitting the arrows on my keyboard was just not reasonable most times. But I wound up beating the game and achievement bosses barely swinging my sword save for Blasphemous blade's ash of war but even then that was desperation mode. Otherwise it was just throw a fireball and watch my skeletons die in the corner.
                        > watch my skeletons die in the corner

And resurrect. And die. And resurrect.

"I beat Malenia with default key bindings"

"Right this way sir!"
                        It’s honestly not that hard once your hands learn WASD. Movement in any game pretty much feels natural. Also a mouse has better aim.
                            Most PC gamers are going to be completely familiar with WASD. Even with that, the \*other\* default bindings are insane in ER. 'F' to jump? To run and jump attack someone, you would have to hold 'W' + Space + Shift + Mouse Button. It's crazy. Using your pouch requires taking your hand off the mouse and using directional arrows, while also using 'E'. I'm convinced they were chosen by/for Ranni.
                Started DS3 on mouse and keyboard so couldnt adapt for bloodborne. Beat DS2 sotfs, sekiro, and now Elden Ring all on mouse and keyboard, dunno what the issue is?
                    Original souls games had terrible PC ports where using KB+M was absolutely horrendous.

They've been better about it in their more recent titles, but the stigma around them remains.
                        That is fair, Scholar of the first sin re-release still needed a lot of keys re-bound
                    You beat Ds2 on Mouse and keyboard? Respect, that port is anus. Not as bad as the DS1, wherein Heavy Attack was bound to 'H'
                Dark Souls : prepare to die edition is why.
                For me it's mostly two things:

* Mouse camera control was clearly done by a developer who had only a wikipedia article to figure out what a "mouse" is. And he accidentally used the one for the animal, of course.
* Keyboard doesn't let you bind individual actions, rather it forces you to use the some artificial combos as the controller *needs*. But it's a need there, so on the controller it's somewhat understandable. On KB, something as basic as dodge and sprint being on the same button just annoys the piss out of me somehow. I got more than enough buttons, let me actually use them!
            KBM is better for me than controller, the only Soulsborne game I willingly choose to play with a controller is DS2 and that is only because I don't want to completely rewrite my muscle memory to play it, otherwise KBM is better for it as well
        Why is keyboard & mouse harder?

(Here from r/all. Never played a Souls game.)
            The controls are just designed around it. Rotating the camera around the player works better as an analog stick rather than mouse and analog sticks can have movement input possibilities that are more than just a digital (0 or 1) input of up/down/left/right.

Handling items and stuff are also probably easier on controller d-pad, but it's probably not bad on keyboard.

The biggest thing though is that FromSoft games did not work well for keyboard and mouse for a very long time. Dark Souls 1 on PC required a fan patch (DS Fix) to work. DS2 may have also. I think 3 worked out of the box, but it wasn't ideal. The game's community has grown up around the understanding controller is ideal, even on PC. Even if that perception is incorrect now (idk if it is), it's going to take a long time to change.
                Handling items is significantly easier on keyboard IMO, and a [trackball mouse](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61QrqZ8uurL._AC_SL1500_.jpg) handles the camera better than the analog stick does

            It’s not necessarily, it comes down to preference. If someone has played the previous games on all console, a controller probably feels better. Some people really excel in games with KB+M.
            Keyboard inputs are all or nothing, which isn't great for finer control that these games typically require. Some people make it work.
        He's also doing it with his feet.  While blindfolded.  Guided only by the sounds of her attacks.
        Looks like a mouse cursor to select emotes too. I bet they're using a goddamn keyboard and mouse
        Tbh I played all Souls games with KB+M and it's better for me imho, especially the camera control, free aiming spells and bows, attacks without lock-on etc. 

Also, being able to change key binding to suit your needs and engaging more fingers helps. I found using controller very limiting, only exception beibg analog stick for movement but that isn't hard to work around with camera-relative controls.
Her getting naked in the second phase is just her attempting to rise up to his level.
    This is now canon to me.

Honestly it's a hindrance. If she stays focused on one person, it's easier to learn her attack patterns and the proper dodge timing. As soon as you add more players to the mix, it's a lot more unpredictable.

    For the majority of hosts it would be easier to just solo the boss. But I don't think that's something most phantoms (fingers) are interested in, it's not a boosting service. There's also the other phantom dying early, leaving you with a buffed boss.

For Malenia specifically it's not uncommon for the host to have no idea how to deal with Waterfowl and Scarlet Aeonia. Or even worse, they use a greatshield and try to "help". Even running in-between when I'm dodging Waterfowl, healing her to full health.
    Hence spirit ashes sometimes making some bosses harder lol. It's always really hard to dodge an attack that isn't actually aimed at you...
When I'm really, REALLY getting schooled by a boss and summon someone, I do my part by sitting back and throwing black fireballs at them unless the summon(s) are clearly fighting in a way that indicates they want me in the thick of it with my sword and board too.

Worked wonders for Mali...Male...black armor dog man with sword. You best believe when phase two started and he did that flippy shit, my ass was ducking behind pillars any time he looked at me and only peeking out long enough to throw a fireball and then duck back when he was pressuring the summon and they needed time to heal. I was not ashamed to be a coward for that fight. The dude I summoned knew how to dodge all that flippy bullshit and I did not lol.
    >im not afraid to be a coward.


God do I wish most host were like you.

You just need more pot bro
I like your username
But I am committed to charging in with a jump attack!
eh. some of those attacks clearly required learned timing rather than just pure reflexes and patience.
    I think the patience really comes into play when knowing to pull back. Everyone is guilty of trying to get that one more attack in the combo that they know they shouldn't try for and then gets hit. I know i do that far more than i should.
        This.  I haven't even played this game and I kept going "One more swing!!!!" knowing that I couldn't have resisted and would have gotten smacked for it.
            Bruh what are you doing? Play the damn game!
                It's on the list man.  Don't get old, it sucks, you don't have time for anything fun.
    I think the point is that people would rather bang their head against the boss until they beat it themselves, even if it takes hours, than watch somebody else do it for you in 10 minutes. Just how I interpreted it though.
        Could also be people trying to finish the fight in 5 minutes instead of taking their time and only attacking at the proper openings.
            FromSoft combat is a dance. Step at the right time, and the fight is effortless. Miss your cue and you're getting your foot stepped on.
That's my take away here, just keep your distance and only attack after she does a certain attack.  Not gonna lie wasn't as exciting as I'd hope.
    Half of the late game bosses are just waiting for them to finally stop attacking and reading your inputs so you can get a hit in. Malenia would have been so fun in sekiro where you actually get tools for dealing with endless boss strings
        >Half of the late game bosses are just waiting for them to finally stop attacking 

And the final boss is simply running towards it for a chance to hit it for 95% of the fight.
    doesnt look that exciting but it sure is in when you are the one doing it.
        That's the best feeling. When I finally figured out the crucible knight, it felt so damn good being able to beat him with minimal flask usage. But I get so impatient much of the time and rush in, then die and get pissed that I'm losing rune arcs.

All of her waterfowl dance attack can be evaded consistently! :D
    Can you share how do you roll that there? EVERY other close ranged dodge I have seen have people use unlock running bait to bait her into dashing futher at the wrong direction but you are just rolling through it without unlocking. 

Is the second roll forward or backwards? Is that an instant roll after the first? Can it be done with mid roll?
        [This guy shows you how to do it at the end of the vid.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fTOm2H5PUs) w/ controller display.

The timing is very specific for it and I don't think you can do it without light load.

I tried it and died instantly lol so there is some modicum of still needing to git gud.
            I have done it a single time at medium through dumb luck, so it is definitely doable, but incredibly difficult.
                Removing the lock on helps with medium roll, but its still incredibly hard
            [deleted]
                Unlocking and run bait in circle is the most common way to avoid but also the hardest to do so not what we are talking about here.
Right, why is no one talking about it? It's the cleanest close range evade of it I've seen so far. Proves that it can be dodged in a normal fashion, i.e. rolls, but I wonder how consistent it is.
I was going for a no hit run so I was being extra careful. But in this run I believe all my attacks were timed so I wouldnt get punished ^^
I mean, to be fair you can see people's names. If you don't want them to solo the boss, maybe don't summon "Let Me Solo Her"
    Yeah but you have to click the summon sign before you see who it is or you'll get unable to summon, so someone might not be able to read and process before they've clicked to invite.
Nowadays we can only rent gud from those who already got it.
I don’t even need the help, I just want to watch him

    I don't know how anyone can play this type of game without a controller lol its just so made for it.
        I bought an Xbox controller to play it with after trying it on mouse & keyboard. So much better
        I can't use a controller to play these games! The camera control is horrible! I played Sekiro, DS3 and now Elden Ring with M&K
Alt key!
Id say it's 70 percent that read my name and lets me solo her. If not it's all good and we still cheese her >:)
I'll experiment with other weapons soon!

Oh buddy... You have no idea what awaits you lol
The waterfowl dance she does is *very* hard to dodge consistently. If you don't dodge it perfectly or have a shield that can eat it, it will kill you at 50 Vigor. And every time she hits you (shield included) she heals.
This man has atleast 100 hours put in to learning this specific fight with that build. She is incredibly difficult to stun, she heals when she hits you, she has 2 phases (not many bosses do), attacks incredibly quickly with very little telegraphing, produces scarlet rot, moves incredibly quickly, and the area has no pillars or anything to hide behind.

If that doesnt scare you then I dont what will
    She actually is pretty easy to stun. She has pretty poor poise and you really only need to beat on her a bit to stun her. The hard part is getting the opportunity, but I would regularly knock her to her knees in phase 1.
From what I seen, never get to her yet. But she never let her do your 3rd attack nor backstab her. So no crits I guess.

But I am noob at that game.
    She's actually easy to break through poise if you go oonga boonga.  Crit several times over the fight.
She kinda is. Took me almost 3 hours before I killed her. I dont get how builds and magic works and all I had regular twinblade, had a mimic with same thing. 

From side it looked like Maul and Savage fighting Sidius from SW clone wars.
Unless you’re this guy… yes she is
I do not have a tiktok and have not done any streams
    I assumed that, I dont know if this is something you really care about but he is profiting off of pretending to be you, just wanted to make sure you were aware!
        Thank you for the heads up, Stay safe out there!
This was a tutorial video. Amazing skill
Don't try to interrupt her, she has high poise and most of her combos don't actually end when they do because she can sort of animation cancel into other combos.

Basically, her phase 1 is simple:

Regular swings: dodge.

Quick three hits in rapid succession: dodge back if you are mid range and dodge to close to her sides if you are close range.

Kick is unsafe. Dont try to punish.

Quick three hits in rapid succession with a 4th finisher swing: _PUNISH__

grab: dodge to the side

Jump attack into air with downward attack upon landing: punish during windup if you use fast weapons, if str build don't even try that.... wait till she lands to punish. Out of her entire kit, this is the safest one to punish.

Side dodge attack: dodge back.

Waterfowl dance: arguably the most busted move in her entire arsenal, this thing is impossible to whiff on her part. Either block it, dodge it, or die.

But how to dodge it? If you see her raise up into the air with the sword raised in front of her face in a bracing position, immediately run away from her. If you maintain mid range distance from her, when she does this animation it should get you enough distance to force her to miss the first part entirely. *if you missed your chance to run because you got greedy or if you mistook her animations... then the first part of this chain is very hard to dodge properly. I recommend blocking with a greatshield if you can't get the timing down. I wish I could tell you how to dodge that, but it's really not something I can put into words. You just gotta learn the timing*

The second part, visually is when there is a very slight pause in between the first few slashes and then she spins again and slashes some more. When she does this, if you managed to dodge the first part, dodge into her to force her attack to go past you, time the dodge with the start of her new slashing chain. *if you blocked or got hit by the first chain. Try to stay calm even though she just ate 90% of your health or stamina. You can recover by the second part of the dance, just dodge into her. Time the dodge with the start up of her chain and you should force her to miss.*

The last part of her dance, punctuated by another slight pause... is the same as her second. Dodge into her, but at an angle, so she travels forward and away from you. Then dodge again as the slashes have a wide aoe, you might not have enough distance so the age slashing might still catch you if you accidently walk toward her, or if you underestimate the aoe size.

Then the flurrish finisher. Wait to punish until she lands and the final circle of slashes ends.

During her phase 2:

During the big scarlet aoe flower... run under her, and she should miss. Careful not to try and get close during the scarlet blooming. It can kill you fairly easily. This attack is punishable if you use range. I recommend swarm of flies or comet Azur.

She gains new moves during phase 2 and is more aggressive.

She floats in mid air, you cannot melee her, she can do 1 of two attacks while in the air.

1.) Clone versions of herself to attack in alternating pattern. Dodge opposite the side of the clone direction. 

2.) Fly down and toward you in an arc pattern, almost immediately on landing she stabs at you. Dodge both and this is deceptively fast, so try to dodge without waiting for a big windup.

She also generates explosions on some attacks and those can build up scarlet rot.

Hope this helps, I know it's just words and not an actual video, but hopefully you can find some use in them when you get the hang of her animations and patterns.

                Also molded by it
                    He did not see the grace until he beat the game and by then it was nothing to him but BLINDING
                        I absolutely believe this individual to do a no-grace run.
            Do you think that's 'git gud' you're breathing?
                Stop trying to 'git gud' and 'git gud'!
            If I take that "git gud" off your face, will you die?
                It would be extremely painful
                    You're a big jar
                        For you
    I was nothing until I put on the jar.
        Let’s not stand on ceremony here, Tarnished…
        If you’re nothing without the jar, then you shouldn’t have it
Maybe he's born with it. Maybe it's Elden Ring.

Go full wizard, get moonveil and something with bloodhound step on it for your right hand, staff for your left. Fully upgrade it all. Upgrade both mimic and Black Knife Tiche. Get the important spells by looking up guides on youtube. Find the power-leveling spots and over-level. 

If you have no shame you can beat the game and it's not that bad, quite fun actually. I'm a dad gamer that likes to have a beer or two while playing and I did it. With bloodhound step and a summon Malenia's a bit of a pushover, I had the most trouble with the Elden Beast until I was able to line up one good flask chug into Meteorite of Astel (which took off more than half it's HP bar).

I'll never claim to be actually good at the game, but I did beat it and I'll take that.
    Dude, that was my build too. Melania was still tough, but the Elden Best was just frustrating. Hoping it’s better on my unga bunga play through
        Want to know the trick for unga-bunga Elden Beast? It's called Fallingstar Beast Jaw.

Yeah, you'll have to invest a lil' bit of int to use it, or just boost it with gear, however, the weapon art on this thing trivializes any boss encounter you might have problem with. Just summon your Mimic, stand there and smack someone with lightning until they die. Gravity Bolt staggers bosses in like 3-4 casts, does massive damage, costs little to no FP and can be chain-casted real quick. Certified cheese right there.

The other option is if you don't want to invest any int - and it's Flame of the Redmanes. Get this bad boy, slap it on any heavy bonk stick you might want to use, steamroll through the game. Takes a bit to cast, costs more FP than Gravity Bolt, but staggers like no tomorrow. You can stagger pretty much anything in up to 3 casts, walk up, crit, repeat.
            Eleanoras pole blade is also great if you want to have a stagger party.  It has a godlike weapon art that does insane poise damage, stacks bleed, is super mobile and is one of the most fun weapon arts to use IMO.
                That thing also gives you poise and I-frames, it's insane.
                Yeah, it's not a big bonk stick though. Therefore, no unga bunga, and no unga bunga = no fun.
                I looove Eleonora's so much. Bloodblade Dance is the guddest I can hit 😂
            Boy, it's a good thing I boosted every special weapon to +9 because I think this one will actually get some use from me now!
                Yeah, I'm doing a "magical bonk" build, currently dual-wielding Royal Greatswords at NG+2 while going for every ending, and while my trusty ultras are usually enough, I keep that Cheesingstar Beast Jaw in my pocket for especially annoying fights.
        It's not, you spend half the time running after it.
            And then by the time you catch it, all your stamina is gone so you can’t even get the max hits in before it runs away again
                And the distances you had to run! It was SO FAR AWAY, and when you reached it half the time it was instantly in the sky or on the other side again. Why wasnt the arena at least a little smaller?
        I found the unga-bunga fine. Here's my history:

My first character was a blocky-boy. I held my shield up and took light chip damage to everything Radagon and Beast could do (except grabs, had to fatroll the grabs to save a flask charge). He did up to NG+2 without me having to learn Radagon's moveset in the least, just equipped a Fingerprint shield, the scaled set, and anything thrusting.

My second character was a giga-bonk (dual colossal maces) unga build and beat the game with them at \~level 100-115. I was really worried about never learning Radagon before. Here's a hint, his face hates being smashed. Actually, everything seemed to hate having their faces smashed in by 4 colossal hammers. I don't know if I landed a single dodge on him, I just spammed jump-smash until he hit me, let my mimic grab aggro and flasked. Then resumed jump-smashing. I had 10 flask charges total, at +5. I used 7 charges on Radagon.

Elden Beast was weak to bonk too. I whiffed three of his 4-hit holy slash combo (again, I've never dodged before) and had to heal up from 5% HP, but he died really fast and didn't get to do very much. If you can do the ring jump once or twice, that's all it takes (hint for melee, run directly away from where he air-twirlies. He will resurface directly in front of you after you jump the ring. Bonk his brains out, *unload that stamina bar in his stupid swimming face hole*.)
        I was so frustrated on elden beast then I equipped pearldrake talisman +2 and haligdrake talisman +2 and it was so much better. You can also mix a wondrous physick to absorb non physical damage and damage from a spell. All this made me beat Elden Beast first try in NG+ after struggling without

            Same. Rip on magic all you want, but I’m out here healing, swinging giant frost greatswords, cosplaying goku, sniping enemies with a greatbow, raining down meteors and hellfire, and shooting a fucking moon at my enemies. It’s so much fun that I don’t care if it’s not the true souls experience.
        Elden Beast feels lika a fight designed to be fought on horse... It's not that difficult, IMO, but so fucking annoying to keep running after it
    For me I beat Elden beast by using the Radagon cheese where you run up on him right after loading in with a light load and spam carian slicer on him without staggering him while he doesn’t move. On the last hit throw on that one talisman that keeps aggro on you and summon your mimic tear then replace the talisman with whatever it was before. Get to elden beast and use bloodhound’s step on your right weapon and rock sling w/ meteorite staff in your left. Some good rng just made it a waiting game for him to die and some staggers kept my mimic alive. 27 faith for the holy damage negation spell was also a godsend. 


I don’t feel bad at all about circumcising radagon. Tried the fight normally around 30ish times and did fine on him but could barely ever get Elden beast to half. It’s just a horrible fight all around for a melee build.
        I’m happy for you, or sorry that happened. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m about to face the Elden Beast for the 200th time. This ones it, I can feel it.
            [deleted]
                Stop. Come back tomorrow and suddenly and inexplicably one shot him. This is the way.
                That’s happened to me a few times over the last week with Fire Giant. I’ll get him soon. I can taste it.
            Don't forget to come back and let us celebrate with you when you win!
            I have a Faith built using a sacred hammer and longsword along with the brass shield. 

Radagon phase: summoned Tiche (black flame does wonders on gods), was about shield and counterattacks, along with matching talismans (curved sword, crimson assassin...). Very important: I used the divine protection, the one provided by Sir Gideon Ofnir after being defeated, it significantly lowers the damage taken.

Beast phase: divine protection cast, then switching to Radagon's Icon, the incantation buff talisman, close up and using the pest's needles incantation. It obliterates huge enemies taking all the needles (works very nicely with dragons as well). The rest of the time, I run away from the Elden stars and huge aoe, and keep on raising my shield when getting close to it.

You'll block holy at 98.7%, and what gets through won't hurt to much.  Last run on NG6, I used 1 heal pot for the encounter, and I'm no amazing gamer.
        I had trouble at first with the elden beast with melee. Then I found spamming strong attacks after it does it's 3 hit swipe with the sword will almost always guarantee a stagger.
    Dad gamer here. I over leveled to 160 str/fai and used toot flute on elden beast. I just want to get high in the evenings and fuck around with bosses and cool spells/skills.
    You can basically skip everything before you say 'over-level' and just do that with any build. Over levelling guarantees success simply because you put in the effort to grind instead of trying to immediately get on the level of broken sword only runs because of the mental gymnastics and pressure the community pumps out about gitting gud and beating the game with as many handicaps as possible. These games are about winning by any means and playing how you want, so there's no shame no matter what you do.
     No hate on people who do use that build but I hate the thought of having to change my build just for a boss. Every souls game I've played my first run has been a faith/strength build and by god I will beat my paladin head against every brick wall this game has

        What if getting hit is part of my skill?
    [deleted]
In the video OP doesn't get hit a single time, including during the Waterfowl Dance she uses twice (though not at all in phase 2). She can't heal if she doesn't hit you...
    Why did her health bar look all janky when she gets hit? Looked she was getting hit, healing some dam then getting hit again.
        Lag, possibly.
        Just standard FromSoft multiplayer jank lol.
        Coop lag.
    As a melee character who’s no where near as good as OP, while I’m very much aware if I avoid getting hit she can’t heal, she just does.
        OP dodges her blade, while most of us guide ourselves into it.
            I have mastered the art of becoming one with the blade
                ... just not my own.
    It's a good showcase as to how one can dodge the Waterfowl Dance, both when further away (first time) and when directly under her (second time). I keep seeing comments saying it is actually impossible to dodge that attack etc. and I think it will be helpful to learn the dodge timing he uses. Because once you figured the fight out (arguably before that aswell but anyways), it is imo one of or the greatest fight in the game. Gives one the amazing duel kind of feeling when playing solo melee!
        His close range dodge is only possible because of light roll, medium roll needs a even tighter frame to dodge and you might need to run closely around her while she's in the air (haven't tried medium roll with his technique yet)
Tip: dont get hit
    Shit I knew I was fucking something up

Nice, didn’t realize this.  I imagine I’ll need to do his quest first.  Is it too late?
    I think so. I met him at the Radahn Festival then again like at the magma fields area to get him unstuck. Not sure what's the precise requirement tho
        I missed him in Limgrave, saw him at the festival, and saw him in the magma fields and I was able to use him in the Fire Giant fight so you can 100% skip the Limgrave one it seems.
            His quest is very forgiving. He appears generally in this order:

>!Limgrave, Gael Tunnel, Radahn, Liurnia, Mt. Gelmir, Fire Giant, and Farum Azula!<

I actually accidentally skipped him in Liurnia and still managed to finish his quest. So I would assume the important ones are probably >!Radahan, Mt Gelmir, and Farum Azula.!< That would be my guess. You do miss out on a few items if you don’t meet him and help him get unstuck.
            ^ this

In fact this is my exact experience in my playthrough actually. Was then able to complete his questline after that, in the next area past the Fire Giant.
            In 4 of 5 play throughs he hasn’t even shown up in Liurnia for me, after the festival I only find him in Mt. Gelmir after that. Once I’ve seen him in Liurnia.
        He is not stuck in the lava stream. He is in there by choice. It isn't hot enough to "temper" him, however, so he seeks the giant's flame. That's why you meet him in the fire giant's boss room.
            You are right, thanks for the clarification. Had momentarily forgotten the details by this point.
        I met him in limgrave and got him unstuck but I don’t think I’ve seen him since.
            Hmm, assuming you have beaten Radahn he may still be at Radahn's site of grace. Fextra says his dialogue here needs to be exhausted before he will move on to other places.

Full article for the other locations afterwards: https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Iron+Fist+Alexander
            Not sure how far you are, but you can complete his quest basically at any time it seems.

Avoiding spoilers, you see him again for the Radahn Festival in Caelid. He'll then go train somewhere hot, to temper himself. You can meet him again near a giant sky pot, inside a boss arena (as a summon). Finally, you can see him in a swirly crumbly timey wimy zone.

I think he pops up a few other places too, but those seem like the most story important places to find him.
            Probably 
>!talk to him at radahns’ arena may not be necessary but exhaust dialogue!<
>!find him stuck again in luirnia need oil pot. Recipe book sold by merchant in siofra river ( up scaffolding in the middle he’s hidden above the flower)!<
>!also jairburn (not sure if that’s right but jar town) is near there so look around!<
>!will find him near a fort in Mt. gelmir behind a lava wyrm!<
Should be available for fire giant at this point I believe.
    Hm. Maybe? He may still be stuck in the ground. Or he could be in the battlefield after the radahn fight
        Stuck in the ground in Liurnia but it’s overlooking the jar people town on top of the cliff. Need an oil pot and preferably but not required a colossal weapon
            I never found him there, but still managed to summon him for Fire Giant and then complete his questline shortly after.
    Look up his questline, you'll likely be able to find where he is in your current playthrough
    If you haven't beaten the giant you might still be in time, you need to follow his quest line until you find him after a magma wyrm in Mt Gelmir. If you're too late I still encourage you to follow his quest line since in the end you get a very useful talisman.
    If I may offer a suggestion, I used Torrent the whole time. I’d zip in, get a hit or two on his ankle, and zip out. You can outrun/dodge any attack except his wave attack (puts plate in grounds and throws upwards, spraying ice/rocks in a cone). Don’t run too far so he doesn’t use this attack. 

For his 2nd phase, same idea. It’s tough to get his forearms at a good time so just zip in, poke his no-leg, and forearms when available.
    Keep in mind, there's two entrances to the Fire Giant arena, his summon sign is only at one of those.
I really don't recommend summoning him, as it will disable Torrent, and fighting the giant just on foot is very hard.
    I have heard that, and that phase 2 of the Giant fight on horseback becomes trivial. Hasn't been my experience at all, but admittedly I'm much more comfortable fighting on foot even after all those dragons & tree sentinels. Conversely I felt the fight was much easier with Alexander and his excellent tankiness & aggro-drawing. So I guess ones mileage may vary.
        I wouldn't say Torrent trivialized phase 2, but it certainly made it easier to avoid some projectiles and reposition for the floaty Sun spells. My mimic lasted just long enough for me to play patiently with Torrent for the last 20% health. Everyone's boss experiences differ, love that about these games.
        True enough! I've actually had more trouble with the Giant than other late game bosses, even with Torrent. But everyone has their own style.
    i actually found the fight way easier not suing the horse
        Horse litigation
            Let’s go toe-to-toe on horse law and see who comes out the victor.
        Me too. Easier to stay under him and cling close to his legs
Tiche is the best for that fight because her Destined Death will burn a lot of hp away for you
"A golden patch in the snow" you say? I was always taught to stay away from those but I'll have to check that out.
I think my biggest takeaway from this video is that this guy is patient. It's not easy to be patient.
    As I was watching I was constantly pointing out moments I would've jumped in to attack Melania and they did not.
        Seems he had really only 2 or three attacks he knew he could safely go in after. The rest of the time he was just avoiding damage which is tricky enough. 

It's almost like it's possible other attacks are also ok to counter but more risky so why try for them. Wait for the best ones. Dodge the rest. Once you learn the broadcasts, I guess that's the full package. 

That and not being a spaz which is always my problem.
            See what I do is an advanced technique you probably haven’t heard of. I do the exact same thing except I decide to just face tank a hit in exchange for a morsel of damage which causes me to miss all those openings because I’m busy getting stabbed during my sip. A true gamer strat that only worked thanks to the power of way too much vigor lmfao
            The absolute discipline is truly impressive.  That and his god-tier evasion of the Waterfowl dance point blank, plus the clone spam that got me so many times.

Then again, I guess if I fought Melania as much as this dude has, I might be better at it.
                The point blank waterfowl dodge had my mouth wide open. I didnt know you could even pull that off. I had seen people do it when they were ready and do the run away and redirect but from point blank? Amazing.
                    I've seen people do it in a couple of videos, sometimes it looks like they just roll blindly and get lucky, but this was clearly an intentional and perfectly executed dodge.
                        With multiplayet latency no less.
            A good way to practice is to literally just avoid their attacks as long as you can without going for a hit. Make it muscle memory. I think there's a difference in viewing the fight from someone like OP. A lot of people focus on when to attack, when they should be focusing on when to avoid. So it just becomes a battle of impatience, where you're itching to attack them and end up attacking at an inopportune time.

I'm still working my way through the game, and trying to have more patience. I've been doing mediocre.
            That was my strategy for Margit, and Manus from DS1, stand back and bait out the punishable attacks
            Yeah, he played really safe, which is risky in it's own way (the fight last longer)
            Think the ideais you don't know what comes next after her shorter attacks, if it's another short attack you'll get hit. Prob better to wait for attacks with a guaranteed cooldown.

In her 2nd form she seems to emit a short explosion for attacks with cooldowns, which is a nice tell.

Also, dude can even parry her sword attacks, did it in another run.

Edit: ah wait it wasn't this guy, it was MoonMoon who was parrying her attacks. He's a streamer I was watching beat the game at soul lv. 1. Was using a shield + katana for this fight.
        It's that patience to wait, like when you know they are just one or two hits, that separate the wheat from the Chad's.
            I've been playing these since Demons Souls on PS3. Still can't resist the allure of trying to get in one more hit.
    Yeah, we have COUNTLESS threads shitposting about Greatswords and Colossals being shit and gimping you in hard boss fights because your moveset gets restricted to just 3 moves + Weapon Art. Yet here's a guy relying most on just a jump attack and a follow-up R1 slash and doesn't even use bloodhound a single time. 

Patience is the real super power.
    MoonMoon beat her last night with a level 1 toon. It took like 12+ hours of attempts. Basically just perseverance.
I have so much time into Hollow Knight, and I did everything except for the like... Godseeker? Is that what it's called? And NKG. and of course the Radiance fight. I survived everything else only to get my ass handed to me by Radiance over and over and over. I can't imagine there being a harder version of this fight. And people beating it with no damage. I won't even touch steel soul. Nope. Can not make it far without dying. 

I thought I was a gamer. Then the internet showed me I suck. 😅 Oh well. It's fun.
    There's an interesting video discussing how ridiculous the fight is and the fact that people beat it anyway https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kkGaF2vs8o
        No idea about that game, but it was a very entertaining video. Thanks for sharing.
        tuned in for a few minutes.. watched the whole hour.
    There's actually already a harder version of the Radiance fight in the unmodded game (along with several other new bosses) in Godhome, the boss rush area associated with the Godseeker. She's called Absolute Radiance, and she is harder than anything else in the game by an order of magnitude. Plus, in order to get the Godhome ending, you have to beat her at the end of a boss rush that includes *every other boss in the game* first.

Getting that victory is probably my single proudest gaming achievement.
        Amen. That’s my platinum trophy sitting on the top shelf above all others. The rush. The absolute rush of finally killing her after so many times getting so close. The only other moment from a video game that can beat even souls boss victory rush.
        I bet that was an amazing feeling. I couldn't handle some of the beefed up bosses in Godhome. I got there. I checked the place out. Made it through some of the rushes and some of the simpler challenges. But nah, definitely not good enough at HK to make it through that content. 😅 I was proud enough of what I did accomplish. You though. Take an upvote and my mad respect.
Totally,  also since your inputs get stored if you do an extra input is enough to ruin the whole fight, I always roll( panic roll) more that I want or do that extra unnecessary attack(greed attack) that fucks it all up.
Tangentially related, I think I saw one of the most skillful plays of a game ever yesterday. Not a boss, but a kaizo mario run.

First I watched the videos that arguably popularized kaizo mario: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2A4C8FFD54A1AA10

These videos show a friend of the level designer play through his romhack. Superbly edited videos, showing every death, excellently communicating the feelings of the player without wasting your time and by only showing gameplay.

Then I watched this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv5Lpzzjf6s

I think another category of incredible is the blindfolded sekiro speedruns (just search youtube for it)
Exactly this. I've just started with DS2, so I'm not gud yet, but watching this video I thought of all the times I tried to sneak just one more attack on a boss, even though I know the window is closing. I try to make the fight faster that way, but instead I just make it go many times longer having to repeat it over and over.
I haven't played Elden Ring but have watched tons of streamers play it. What I've noticed is that everyone loved the game when it came out. And then they started reaching the end game bosses and they all kind of hated them. And this is why. They only have one or two attacks that allow for counter attacks. It doesn't really make for a good boss fight.

I watched that whole video and it's basically just dodging everything she does waiting for her to do the one attack that is safe to counter attack.
    There are plenty of opportunities for aggression and counter attacks, Malenia is just fairly punishing if you go too far. This guy was even more careful than necessary though and he was able to do it no-hit, but if you aren't trying for that specific challenge, you should easily be relatively fine being more aggressive than him.

Lots of streamers are whiny man-children. Don't take their opinions on boss fights as gospel.
Same here. Such restraint and zen from that guy. She kept leaving fake openings that I would have rushed like an idiot but he always waited for her attack to finish then hit twice and left. Dodge back from her sword and sideways for projectiles. Amazing

Using Margott’s cursed sword with Dex 40, Arc ~20, and Vig 40.  I’ve gotten him to around 20% health on one of my better runs but can’t quite finish him.
    Is it the double shot of the straight fireballs that gets you? Cause of that's the case roll forward last second or run for cover. 

Only reason I guess that is because that's what majority of my hosts die to 

Otherwise...

If it's the slow moving balls just run near them then away and they whiff every time. 

If it's melee attacks, all I can say is timing. 

If it's his big ass rolls, stick to right left as he mostly seems to go to his left. 

And it should never be the firestorm that gets you, classing "don't stand on the red circles" mechanic
    Ahhh. I’m like pure str/vig besides some dex+ stuff to wield ruins.
A bit unrelated, but I have to ask, is it just me, or is this madman fighting her using keyboard + mouse? 

I just noticed in the video that all the button prompts are for the keyboard and not a controller. I swear, if they are, it's just another layer of impressiveness on top of how impressed I already am…

Edit: since I'm getting questions about the difference between using KB+M and a controller for these games from folks who have never played them, as a brief explanation, using a controller is generally more intuitive as the movement is designed around having control via analog sticks, as opposed to a limited set of directional inputs that generally comes with the keyboard (i.e. up/down/left/right), as well as limited space to move your mouse around depending on your setup. As someone who previously played using both KB+M and controller in previous games, I can also say that using KB+M can also be tricky with the bindings and personally took me much longer to adapt to than using a controller.

The other issue is that historically the souls games have had very poor implementation for KB+M; in fact, in DS1 I recall that it required a fan to create a patch to get it to even work. I personally can tell you that it was not a fun time trying to learn keyboard/mouse controls in the previous games and that ultimately a controller was a much easier and more intuitive choice. That being said, I'm now being told that apparently the KB+M implementation is actually pretty good in Elden Ring, so perhaps From finally figured out what they were doing. I'll personally be sticking with the controller, though.

            Furled Fingers don't lose souls when they die!
            He wouldn't lose them if he died anyway...
    I'd almost wager it's a benefit in a fight like this where you can more quickly change direction of motion to get away from the first burst of waterfowl dance, but this is like 95% this guy being an absolute unit and having her moveset memorized.
    I dont think kb + mouse are as bad as ppl say they are. I beat her with them.
        Yeah I use kb+m I dont know why people think it's so bad
            [deleted]
                I know I remapped the change spells to one of my mouse buttons since hitting the arrows on my keyboard was just not reasonable most times. But I wound up beating the game and achievement bosses barely swinging my sword save for Blasphemous blade's ash of war but even then that was desperation mode. Otherwise it was just throw a fireball and watch my skeletons die in the corner.
                    > watch my skeletons die in the corner

And resurrect. And die. And resurrect.

For as awesome as Tiche can be, nothing carries harder than Lloyd and Harry do, my trusty if stupid skeleton militamen.
                    Yep. My mouse wheel is changing flasks/consumable and also changing incants. Also makes it easy to get on torrent as I have that set to E+mwheel
                "How tough are ya?"

"I beat Malenia with default key bindings"

"Right this way sir!"
                    It’s honestly not that hard once your hands learn WASD. Movement in any game pretty much feels natural. Also a mouse has better aim.
                        Most PC gamers are going to be completely familiar with WASD. Even with that, the \*other\* default bindings are insane in ER. 'F' to jump? To run and jump attack someone, you would have to hold 'W' + Space + Shift + Mouse Button. It's crazy. Using your pouch requires taking your hand off the mouse and using directional arrows, while also using 'E'. I'm convinced they were chosen by/for Ranni.
            Started DS3 on mouse and keyboard so couldnt adapt for bloodborne. Beat DS2 sotfs, sekiro, and now Elden Ring all on mouse and keyboard, dunno what the issue is?
                Original souls games had terrible PC ports where using KB+M was absolutely horrendous.

They've been better about it in their more recent titles, but the stigma around them remains.
                    That is fair, Scholar of the first sin re-release still needed a lot of keys re-bound
                You beat Ds2 on Mouse and keyboard? Respect, that port is anus. Not as bad as the DS1, wherein Heavy Attack was bound to 'H'
            Dark Souls : prepare to die edition is why.
            For me it's mostly two things:

* Mouse camera control was clearly done by a developer who had only a wikipedia article to figure out what a "mouse" is. And he accidentally used the one for the animal, of course.
* Keyboard doesn't let you bind individual actions, rather it forces you to use the some artificial combos as the controller *needs*. But it's a need there, so on the controller it's somewhat understandable. On KB, something as basic as dodge and sprint being on the same button just annoys the piss out of me somehow. I got more than enough buttons, let me actually use them!
        KBM is better for me than controller, the only Soulsborne game I willingly choose to play with a controller is DS2 and that is only because I don't want to completely rewrite my muscle memory to play it, otherwise KBM is better for it as well
    Why is keyboard & mouse harder?

(Here from r/all. Never played a Souls game.)
        The controls are just designed around it. Rotating the camera around the player works better as an analog stick rather than mouse and analog sticks can have movement input possibilities that are more than just a digital (0 or 1) input of up/down/left/right.

Handling items and stuff are also probably easier on controller d-pad, but it's probably not bad on keyboard.

The biggest thing though is that FromSoft games did not work well for keyboard and mouse for a very long time. Dark Souls 1 on PC required a fan patch (DS Fix) to work. DS2 may have also. I think 3 worked out of the box, but it wasn't ideal. The game's community has grown up around the understanding controller is ideal, even on PC. Even if that perception is incorrect now (idk if it is), it's going to take a long time to change.
            Handling items is significantly easier on keyboard IMO, and a [trackball mouse](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61QrqZ8uurL._AC_SL1500_.jpg) handles the camera better than the analog stick does

        It’s not necessarily, it comes down to preference. If someone has played the previous games on all console, a controller probably feels better. Some people really excel in games with KB+M.
        Keyboard inputs are all or nothing, which isn't great for finer control that these games typically require. Some people make it work.
    He's also doing it with his feet.  While blindfolded.  Guided only by the sounds of her attacks.
    Looks like a mouse cursor to select emotes too. I bet they're using a goddamn keyboard and mouse
    Tbh I played all Souls games with KB+M and it's better for me imho, especially the camera control, free aiming spells and bows, attacks without lock-on etc. 

Also, being able to change key binding to suit your needs and engaging more fingers helps. I found using controller very limiting, only exception beibg analog stick for movement but that isn't hard to work around with camera-relative controls.
This is now canon to me.

Very impressive, Malenia, but can you *hang dong*?!

            If you've got frost pots you can knock her out of waterfowl dance 2x in the fight before she's immune
    The agro talisman doesn't work?
For the majority of hosts it would be easier to just solo the boss. But I don't think that's something most phantoms (fingers) are interested in, it's not a boosting service. There's also the other phantom dying early, leaving you with a buffed boss.

For Malenia specifically it's not uncommon for the host to have no idea how to deal with Waterfowl and Scarlet Aeonia. Or even worse, they use a greatshield and try to "help". Even running in-between when I'm dodging Waterfowl, healing her to full health.
Hence spirit ashes sometimes making some bosses harder lol. It's always really hard to dodge an attack that isn't actually aimed at you...
>im not afraid to be a coward.

I think the patience really comes into play when knowing to pull back. Everyone is guilty of trying to get that one more attack in the combo that they know they shouldn't try for and then gets hit. I know i do that far more than i should.
    This.  I haven't even played this game and I kept going "One more swing!!!!" knowing that I couldn't have resisted and would have gotten smacked for it.
        Bruh what are you doing? Play the damn game!
            It's on the list man.  Don't get old, it sucks, you don't have time for anything fun.
I think the point is that people would rather bang their head against the boss until they beat it themselves, even if it takes hours, than watch somebody else do it for you in 10 minutes. Just how I interpreted it though.
    Could also be people trying to finish the fight in 5 minutes instead of taking their time and only attacking at the proper openings.
        FromSoft combat is a dance. Step at the right time, and the fight is effortless. Miss your cue and you're getting your foot stepped on.
Half of the late game bosses are just waiting for them to finally stop attacking and reading your inputs so you can get a hit in. Malenia would have been so fun in sekiro where you actually get tools for dealing with endless boss strings
    >Half of the late game bosses are just waiting for them to finally stop attacking 

And the final boss is simply running towards it for a chance to hit it for 95% of the fight.
doesnt look that exciting but it sure is in when you are the one doing it.
    That's the best feeling. When I finally figured out the crucible knight, it felt so damn good being able to beat him with minimal flask usage. But I get so impatient much of the time and rush in, then die and get pissed that I'm losing rune arcs.

Can you share how do you roll that there? EVERY other close ranged dodge I have seen have people use unlock running bait to bait her into dashing futher at the wrong direction but you are just rolling through it without unlocking. 

Is the second roll forward or backwards? Is that an instant roll after the first? Can it be done with mid roll?
    [This guy shows you how to do it at the end of the vid.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fTOm2H5PUs) w/ controller display.

The timing is very specific for it and I don't think you can do it without light load.

I tried it and died instantly lol so there is some modicum of still needing to git gud.
        I have done it a single time at medium through dumb luck, so it is definitely doable, but incredibly difficult.
            Removing the lock on helps with medium roll, but its still incredibly hard
        [deleted]
            Unlocking and run bait in circle is the most common way to avoid but also the hardest to do so not what we are talking about here.
Yeah but you have to click the summon sign before you see who it is or you'll get unable to summon, so someone might not be able to read and process before they've clicked to invite.
I don't know how anyone can play this type of game without a controller lol its just so made for it.
    I bought an Xbox controller to play it with after trying it on mouse & keyboard. So much better
    I can't use a controller to play these games! The camera control is horrible! I played Sekiro, DS3 and now Elden Ring with M&K
Thanks brother.

What are your stats?
mind posting your stats and talismans?
She actually is pretty easy to stun. She has pretty poor poise and you really only need to beat on her a bit to stun her. The hard part is getting the opportunity, but I would regularly knock her to her knees in phase 1.
She's actually easy to break through poise if you go oonga boonga.  Crit several times over the fight.
I assumed that, I dont know if this is something you really care about but he is profiting off of pretending to be you, just wanted to make sure you were aware!

Dude, that was my build too. Melania was still tough, but the Elden Best was just frustrating. Hoping it’s better on my unga bunga play through
    Want to know the trick for unga-bunga Elden Beast? It's called Fallingstar Beast Jaw.

Yeah, you'll have to invest a lil' bit of int to use it, or just boost it with gear, however, the weapon art on this thing trivializes any boss encounter you might have problem with. Just summon your Mimic, stand there and smack someone with lightning until they die. Gravity Bolt staggers bosses in like 3-4 casts, does massive damage, costs little to no FP and can be chain-casted real quick. Certified cheese right there.

The other option is if you don't want to invest any int - and it's Flame of the Redmanes. Get this bad boy, slap it on any heavy bonk stick you might want to use, steamroll through the game. Takes a bit to cast, costs more FP than Gravity Bolt, but staggers like no tomorrow. You can stagger pretty much anything in up to 3 casts, walk up, crit, repeat.
        Eleanoras pole blade is also great if you want to have a stagger party.  It has a godlike weapon art that does insane poise damage, stacks bleed, is super mobile and is one of the most fun weapon arts to use IMO.
            That thing also gives you poise and I-frames, it's insane.
            Yeah, it's not a big bonk stick though. Therefore, no unga bunga, and no unga bunga = no fun.
            I looove Eleonora's so much. Bloodblade Dance is the guddest I can hit 😂
        Boy, it's a good thing I boosted every special weapon to +9 because I think this one will actually get some use from me now!
            Yeah, I'm doing a "magical bonk" build, currently dual-wielding Royal Greatswords at NG+2 while going for every ending, and while my trusty ultras are usually enough, I keep that Cheesingstar Beast Jaw in my pocket for especially annoying fights.
    It's not, you spend half the time running after it.
        And then by the time you catch it, all your stamina is gone so you can’t even get the max hits in before it runs away again
            And the distances you had to run! It was SO FAR AWAY, and when you reached it half the time it was instantly in the sky or on the other side again. Why wasnt the arena at least a little smaller?
    I found the unga-bunga fine. Here's my history:

My first character was a blocky-boy. I held my shield up and took light chip damage to everything Radagon and Beast could do (except grabs, had to fatroll the grabs to save a flask charge). He did up to NG+2 without me having to learn Radagon's moveset in the least, just equipped a Fingerprint shield, the scaled set, and anything thrusting.

My second character was a giga-bonk (dual colossal maces) unga build and beat the game with them at \~level 100-115. I was really worried about never learning Radagon before. Here's a hint, his face hates being smashed. Actually, everything seemed to hate having their faces smashed in by 4 colossal hammers. I don't know if I landed a single dodge on him, I just spammed jump-smash until he hit me, let my mimic grab aggro and flasked. Then resumed jump-smashing. I had 10 flask charges total, at +5. I used 7 charges on Radagon.

Elden Beast was weak to bonk too. I whiffed three of his 4-hit holy slash combo (again, I've never dodged before) and had to heal up from 5% HP, but he died really fast and didn't get to do very much. If you can do the ring jump once or twice, that's all it takes (hint for melee, run directly away from where he air-twirlies. He will resurface directly in front of you after you jump the ring. Bonk his brains out, *unload that stamina bar in his stupid swimming face hole*.)
    I was so frustrated on elden beast then I equipped pearldrake talisman +2 and haligdrake talisman +2 and it was so much better. You can also mix a wondrous physick to absorb non physical damage and damage from a spell. All this made me beat Elden Beast first try in NG+ after struggling without
    [deleted]
        Same. Rip on magic all you want, but I’m out here healing, swinging giant frost greatswords, cosplaying goku, sniping enemies with a greatbow, raining down meteors and hellfire, and shooting a fucking moon at my enemies. It’s so much fun that I don’t care if it’s not the true souls experience.
    Elden Beast feels lika a fight designed to be fought on horse... It's not that difficult, IMO, but so fucking annoying to keep running after it
For me I beat Elden beast by using the Radagon cheese where you run up on him right after loading in with a light load and spam carian slicer on him without staggering him while he doesn’t move. On the last hit throw on that one talisman that keeps aggro on you and summon your mimic tear then replace the talisman with whatever it was before. Get to elden beast and use bloodhound’s step on your right weapon and rock sling w/ meteorite staff in your left. Some good rng just made it a waiting game for him to die and some staggers kept my mimic alive. 27 faith for the holy damage negation spell was also a godsend. 


I don’t feel bad at all about circumcising radagon. Tried the fight normally around 30ish times and did fine on him but could barely ever get Elden beast to half. It’s just a horrible fight all around for a melee build.
    I’m happy for you, or sorry that happened. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m about to face the Elden Beast for the 200th time. This ones it, I can feel it.
        [deleted]
            Stop. Come back tomorrow and suddenly and inexplicably one shot him. This is the way.
            That’s happened to me a few times over the last week with Fire Giant. I’ll get him soon. I can taste it.
        Don't forget to come back and let us celebrate with you when you win!
        I have a Faith built using a sacred hammer and longsword along with the brass shield. 

Radagon phase: summoned Tiche (black flame does wonders on gods), was about shield and counterattacks, along with matching talismans (curved sword, crimson assassin...). Very important: I used the divine protection, the one provided by Sir Gideon Ofnir after being defeated, it significantly lowers the damage taken.

Beast phase: divine protection cast, then switching to Radagon's Icon, the incantation buff talisman, close up and using the pest's needles incantation. It obliterates huge enemies taking all the needles (works very nicely with dragons as well). The rest of the time, I run away from the Elden stars and huge aoe, and keep on raising my shield when getting close to it.

You'll block holy at 98.7%, and what gets through won't hurt to much.  Last run on NG6, I used 1 heal pot for the encounter, and I'm no amazing gamer.
    I had trouble at first with the elden beast with melee. Then I found spamming strong attacks after it does it's 3 hit swipe with the sword will almost always guarantee a stagger.
Dad gamer here. I over leveled to 160 str/fai and used toot flute on elden beast. I just want to get high in the evenings and fuck around with bosses and cool spells/skills.
You can basically skip everything before you say 'over-level' and just do that with any build. Over levelling guarantees success simply because you put in the effort to grind instead of trying to immediately get on the level of broken sword only runs because of the mental gymnastics and pressure the community pumps out about gitting gud and beating the game with as many handicaps as possible. These games are about winning by any means and playing how you want, so there's no shame no matter what you do.
 No hate on people who do use that build but I hate the thought of having to change my build just for a boss. Every souls game I've played my first run has been a faith/strength build and by god I will beat my paladin head against every brick wall this game has

    What if getting hit is part of my skill?
[deleted]
Why did her health bar look all janky when she gets hit? Looked she was getting hit, healing some dam then getting hit again.
    Lag, possibly.
    Just standard FromSoft multiplayer jank lol.
    Coop lag.
As a melee character who’s no where near as good as OP, while I’m very much aware if I avoid getting hit she can’t heal, she just does.
    OP dodges her blade, while most of us guide ourselves into it.
        I have mastered the art of becoming one with the blade
            ... just not my own.
It's a good showcase as to how one can dodge the Waterfowl Dance, both when further away (first time) and when directly under her (second time). I keep seeing comments saying it is actually impossible to dodge that attack etc. and I think it will be helpful to learn the dodge timing he uses. Because once you figured the fight out (arguably before that aswell but anyways), it is imo one of or the greatest fight in the game. Gives one the amazing duel kind of feeling when playing solo melee!
    His close range dodge is only possible because of light roll, medium roll needs a even tighter frame to dodge and you might need to run closely around her while she's in the air (haven't tried medium roll with his technique yet)
Shit I knew I was fucking something up

I think so. I met him at the Radahn Festival then again like at the magma fields area to get him unstuck. Not sure what's the precise requirement tho
    I missed him in Limgrave, saw him at the festival, and saw him in the magma fields and I was able to use him in the Fire Giant fight so you can 100% skip the Limgrave one it seems.
        His quest is very forgiving. He appears generally in this order:

>!Limgrave, Gael Tunnel, Radahn, Liurnia, Mt. Gelmir, Fire Giant, and Farum Azula!<

I actually accidentally skipped him in Liurnia and still managed to finish his quest. So I would assume the important ones are probably >!Radahan, Mt Gelmir, and Farum Azula.!< That would be my guess. You do miss out on a few items if you don’t meet him and help him get unstuck.
        ^ this

In fact this is my exact experience in my playthrough actually. Was then able to complete his questline after that, in the next area past the Fire Giant.
        In 4 of 5 play throughs he hasn’t even shown up in Liurnia for me, after the festival I only find him in Mt. Gelmir after that. Once I’ve seen him in Liurnia.
    He is not stuck in the lava stream. He is in there by choice. It isn't hot enough to "temper" him, however, so he seeks the giant's flame. That's why you meet him in the fire giant's boss room.
        You are right, thanks for the clarification. Had momentarily forgotten the details by this point.
    I met him in limgrave and got him unstuck but I don’t think I’ve seen him since.
        Hmm, assuming you have beaten Radahn he may still be at Radahn's site of grace. Fextra says his dialogue here needs to be exhausted before he will move on to other places.

        Not sure how far you are, but you can complete his quest basically at any time it seems.

Avoiding spoilers, you see him again for the Radahn Festival in Caelid. He'll then go train somewhere hot, to temper himself. You can meet him again near a giant sky pot, inside a boss arena (as a summon). Finally, you can see him in a swirly crumbly timey wimy zone.

I think he pops up a few other places too, but those seem like the most story important places to find him.
        Probably 
>!talk to him at radahns’ arena may not be necessary but exhaust dialogue!<
>!find him stuck again in luirnia need oil pot. Recipe book sold by merchant in siofra river ( up scaffolding in the middle he’s hidden above the flower)!<
>!also jairburn (not sure if that’s right but jar town) is near there so look around!<
>!will find him near a fort in Mt. gelmir behind a lava wyrm!<
Should be available for fire giant at this point I believe.
Hm. Maybe? He may still be stuck in the ground. Or he could be in the battlefield after the radahn fight
    Stuck in the ground in Liurnia but it’s overlooking the jar people town on top of the cliff. Need an oil pot and preferably but not required a colossal weapon
        I never found him there, but still managed to summon him for Fire Giant and then complete his questline shortly after.
Look up his questline, you'll likely be able to find where he is in your current playthrough
If you haven't beaten the giant you might still be in time, you need to follow his quest line until you find him after a magma wyrm in Mt Gelmir. If you're too late I still encourage you to follow his quest line since in the end you get a very useful talisman.
If I may offer a suggestion, I used Torrent the whole time. I’d zip in, get a hit or two on his ankle, and zip out. You can outrun/dodge any attack except his wave attack (puts plate in grounds and throws upwards, spraying ice/rocks in a cone). Don’t run too far so he doesn’t use this attack. 

For his 2nd phase, same idea. It’s tough to get his forearms at a good time so just zip in, poke his no-leg, and forearms when available.
Keep in mind, there's two entrances to the Fire Giant arena, his summon sign is only at one of those.
I have heard that, and that phase 2 of the Giant fight on horseback becomes trivial. Hasn't been my experience at all, but admittedly I'm much more comfortable fighting on foot even after all those dragons & tree sentinels. Conversely I felt the fight was much easier with Alexander and his excellent tankiness & aggro-drawing. So I guess ones mileage may vary.
    I wouldn't say Torrent trivialized phase 2, but it certainly made it easier to avoid some projectiles and reposition for the floaty Sun spells. My mimic lasted just long enough for me to play patiently with Torrent for the last 20% health. Everyone's boss experiences differ, love that about these games.
    True enough! I've actually had more trouble with the Giant than other late game bosses, even with Torrent. But everyone has their own style.
i actually found the fight way easier not suing the horse
    Horse litigation
        Let’s go toe-to-toe on horse law and see who comes out the victor.
    Me too. Easier to stay under him and cling close to his legs
As I was watching I was constantly pointing out moments I would've jumped in to attack Melania and they did not.
    Seems he had really only 2 or three attacks he knew he could safely go in after. The rest of the time he was just avoiding damage which is tricky enough. 

It's almost like it's possible other attacks are also ok to counter but more risky so why try for them. Wait for the best ones. Dodge the rest. Once you learn the broadcasts, I guess that's the full package. 

That and not being a spaz which is always my problem.
        See what I do is an advanced technique you probably haven’t heard of. I do the exact same thing except I decide to just face tank a hit in exchange for a morsel of damage which causes me to miss all those openings because I’m busy getting stabbed during my sip. A true gamer strat that only worked thanks to the power of way too much vigor lmfao
        The absolute discipline is truly impressive.  That and his god-tier evasion of the Waterfowl dance point blank, plus the clone spam that got me so many times.

Then again, I guess if I fought Melania as much as this dude has, I might be better at it.
            The point blank waterfowl dodge had my mouth wide open. I didnt know you could even pull that off. I had seen people do it when they were ready and do the run away and redirect but from point blank? Amazing.
                I've seen people do it in a couple of videos, sometimes it looks like they just roll blindly and get lucky, but this was clearly an intentional and perfectly executed dodge.
                    With multiplayet latency no less.
        A good way to practice is to literally just avoid their attacks as long as you can without going for a hit. Make it muscle memory. I think there's a difference in viewing the fight from someone like OP. A lot of people focus on when to attack, when they should be focusing on when to avoid. So it just becomes a battle of impatience, where you're itching to attack them and end up attacking at an inopportune time.

I'm still working my way through the game, and trying to have more patience. I've been doing mediocre.
        That was my strategy for Margit, and Manus from DS1, stand back and bait out the punishable attacks
        Yeah, he played really safe, which is risky in it's own way (the fight last longer)
        Think the ideais you don't know what comes next after her shorter attacks, if it's another short attack you'll get hit. Prob better to wait for attacks with a guaranteed cooldown.

In her 2nd form she seems to emit a short explosion for attacks with cooldowns, which is a nice tell.

Also, dude can even parry her sword attacks, did it in another run.

Edit: ah wait it wasn't this guy, it was MoonMoon who was parrying her attacks. He's a streamer I was watching beat the game at soul lv. 1. Was using a shield + katana for this fight.
    It's that patience to wait, like when you know they are just one or two hits, that separate the wheat from the Chad's.
        I've been playing these since Demons Souls on PS3. Still can't resist the allure of trying to get in one more hit.
Yeah, we have COUNTLESS threads shitposting about Greatswords and Colossals being shit and gimping you in hard boss fights because your moveset gets restricted to just 3 moves + Weapon Art. Yet here's a guy relying most on just a jump attack and a follow-up R1 slash and doesn't even use bloodhound a single time. 

Patience is the real super power.
MoonMoon beat her last night with a level 1 toon. It took like 12+ hours of attempts. Basically just perseverance.
There's an interesting video discussing how ridiculous the fight is and the fact that people beat it anyway https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kkGaF2vs8o
    No idea about that game, but it was a very entertaining video. Thanks for sharing.
    tuned in for a few minutes.. watched the whole hour.
There's actually already a harder version of the Radiance fight in the unmodded game (along with several other new bosses) in Godhome, the boss rush area associated with the Godseeker. She's called Absolute Radiance, and she is harder than anything else in the game by an order of magnitude. Plus, in order to get the Godhome ending, you have to beat her at the end of a boss rush that includes *every other boss in the game* first.

Getting that victory is probably my single proudest gaming achievement.
    Amen. That’s my platinum trophy sitting on the top shelf above all others. The rush. The absolute rush of finally killing her after so many times getting so close. The only other moment from a video game that can beat even souls boss victory rush.
    I bet that was an amazing feeling. I couldn't handle some of the beefed up bosses in Godhome. I got there. I checked the place out. Made it through some of the rushes and some of the simpler challenges. But nah, definitely not good enough at HK to make it through that content. 😅 I was proud enough of what I did accomplish. You though. Take an upvote and my mad respect.
There are plenty of opportunities for aggression and counter attacks, Malenia is just fairly punishing if you go too far. This guy was even more careful than necessary though and he was able to do it no-hit, but if you aren't trying for that specific challenge, you should easily be relatively fine being more aggressive than him.

Lots of streamers are whiny man-children. Don't take their opinions on boss fights as gospel.
Lil stump getting straight bonked
Is it the double shot of the straight fireballs that gets you? Cause of that's the case roll forward last second or run for cover. 

Only reason I guess that is because that's what majority of my hosts die to 

Otherwise...

If it's the slow moving balls just run near them then away and they whiff every time. 

If it's melee attacks, all I can say is timing. 

If it's his big ass rolls, stick to right left as he mostly seems to go to his left. 

And it should never be the firestorm that gets you, classing "don't stand on the red circles" mechanic

        He wouldn't lose them if he died anyway...
I'd almost wager it's a benefit in a fight like this where you can more quickly change direction of motion to get away from the first burst of waterfowl dance, but this is like 95% this guy being an absolute unit and having her moveset memorized.
I dont think kb + mouse are as bad as ppl say they are. I beat her with them.
    Yeah I use kb+m I dont know why people think it's so bad
        [deleted]
            I know I remapped the change spells to one of my mouse buttons since hitting the arrows on my keyboard was just not reasonable most times. But I wound up beating the game and achievement bosses barely swinging my sword save for Blasphemous blade's ash of war but even then that was desperation mode. Otherwise it was just throw a fireball and watch my skeletons die in the corner.
                > watch my skeletons die in the corner

And resurrect. And die. And resurrect.

For as awesome as Tiche can be, nothing carries harder than Lloyd and Harry do, my trusty if stupid skeleton militamen.
                Yep. My mouse wheel is changing flasks/consumable and also changing incants. Also makes it easy to get on torrent as I have that set to E+mwheel
            "How tough are ya?"

"I beat Malenia with default key bindings"

"Right this way sir!"
                It’s honestly not that hard once your hands learn WASD. Movement in any game pretty much feels natural. Also a mouse has better aim.
                    Most PC gamers are going to be completely familiar with WASD. Even with that, the \*other\* default bindings are insane in ER. 'F' to jump? To run and jump attack someone, you would have to hold 'W' + Space + Shift + Mouse Button. It's crazy. Using your pouch requires taking your hand off the mouse and using directional arrows, while also using 'E'. I'm convinced they were chosen by/for Ranni.
        Started DS3 on mouse and keyboard so couldnt adapt for bloodborne. Beat DS2 sotfs, sekiro, and now Elden Ring all on mouse and keyboard, dunno what the issue is?
            Original souls games had terrible PC ports where using KB+M was absolutely horrendous.

They've been better about it in their more recent titles, but the stigma around them remains.
                That is fair, Scholar of the first sin re-release still needed a lot of keys re-bound
            You beat Ds2 on Mouse and keyboard? Respect, that port is anus. Not as bad as the DS1, wherein Heavy Attack was bound to 'H'
        Dark Souls : prepare to die edition is why.
        For me it's mostly two things:

* Mouse camera control was clearly done by a developer who had only a wikipedia article to figure out what a "mouse" is. And he accidentally used the one for the animal, of course.
* Keyboard doesn't let you bind individual actions, rather it forces you to use the some artificial combos as the controller *needs*. But it's a need there, so on the controller it's somewhat understandable. On KB, something as basic as dodge and sprint being on the same button just annoys the piss out of me somehow. I got more than enough buttons, let me actually use them!
    KBM is better for me than controller, the only Soulsborne game I willingly choose to play with a controller is DS2 and that is only because I don't want to completely rewrite my muscle memory to play it, otherwise KBM is better for it as well
Why is keyboard & mouse harder?

(Here from r/all. Never played a Souls game.)
    The controls are just designed around it. Rotating the camera around the player works better as an analog stick rather than mouse and analog sticks can have movement input possibilities that are more than just a digital (0 or 1) input of up/down/left/right.

Handling items and stuff are also probably easier on controller d-pad, but it's probably not bad on keyboard.

The biggest thing though is that FromSoft games did not work well for keyboard and mouse for a very long time. Dark Souls 1 on PC required a fan patch (DS Fix) to work. DS2 may have also. I think 3 worked out of the box, but it wasn't ideal. The game's community has grown up around the understanding controller is ideal, even on PC. Even if that perception is incorrect now (idk if it is), it's going to take a long time to change.
        Handling items is significantly easier on keyboard IMO, and a [trackball mouse](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61QrqZ8uurL._AC_SL1500_.jpg) handles the camera better than the analog stick does

    It’s not necessarily, it comes down to preference. If someone has played the previous games on all console, a controller probably feels better. Some people really excel in games with KB+M.
    Keyboard inputs are all or nothing, which isn't great for finer control that these games typically require. Some people make it work.
He's also doing it with his feet.  While blindfolded.  Guided only by the sounds of her attacks.
Looks like a mouse cursor to select emotes too. I bet they're using a goddamn keyboard and mouse
Tbh I played all Souls games with KB+M and it's better for me imho, especially the camera control, free aiming spells and bows, attacks without lock-on etc. 

Also, being able to change key binding to suit your needs and engaging more fingers helps. I found using controller very limiting, only exception beibg analog stick for movement but that isn't hard to work around with camera-relative controls.
The anime internal monologue be like:

"Wh-wh-what?! How can this be possible? He's so powerful he doesn't even need to wear *armor?*

This.  I haven't even played this game and I kept going "One more swing!!!!" knowing that I couldn't have resisted and would have gotten smacked for it.
    Bruh what are you doing? Play the damn game!
        It's on the list man.  Don't get old, it sucks, you don't have time for anything fun.
Could also be people trying to finish the fight in 5 minutes instead of taking their time and only attacking at the proper openings.
    FromSoft combat is a dance. Step at the right time, and the fight is effortless. Miss your cue and you're getting your foot stepped on.
>Half of the late game bosses are just waiting for them to finally stop attacking 

And the final boss is simply running towards it for a chance to hit it for 95% of the fight.
That's the best feeling. When I finally figured out the crucible knight, it felt so damn good being able to beat him with minimal flask usage. But I get so impatient much of the time and rush in, then die and get pissed that I'm losing rune arcs.
Absolutely maidenless behaviour.
Such a harmonious reply.

[This guy shows you how to do it at the end of the vid.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fTOm2H5PUs) w/ controller display.

The timing is very specific for it and I don't think you can do it without light load.

I tried it and died instantly lol so there is some modicum of still needing to git gud.
    I have done it a single time at medium through dumb luck, so it is definitely doable, but incredibly difficult.
        Removing the lock on helps with medium roll, but its still incredibly hard

        Unlocking and run bait in circle is the most common way to avoid but also the hardest to do so not what we are talking about here.
I bought an Xbox controller to play it with after trying it on mouse & keyboard. So much better

Want to know the trick for unga-bunga Elden Beast? It's called Fallingstar Beast Jaw.

Yeah, you'll have to invest a lil' bit of int to use it, or just boost it with gear, however, the weapon art on this thing trivializes any boss encounter you might have problem with. Just summon your Mimic, stand there and smack someone with lightning until they die. Gravity Bolt staggers bosses in like 3-4 casts, does massive damage, costs little to no FP and can be chain-casted real quick. Certified cheese right there.

The other option is if you don't want to invest any int - and it's Flame of the Redmanes. Get this bad boy, slap it on any heavy bonk stick you might want to use, steamroll through the game. Takes a bit to cast, costs more FP than Gravity Bolt, but staggers like no tomorrow. You can stagger pretty much anything in up to 3 casts, walk up, crit, repeat.
    Eleanoras pole blade is also great if you want to have a stagger party.  It has a godlike weapon art that does insane poise damage, stacks bleed, is super mobile and is one of the most fun weapon arts to use IMO.
        That thing also gives you poise and I-frames, it's insane.
        Yeah, it's not a big bonk stick though. Therefore, no unga bunga, and no unga bunga = no fun.
        I looove Eleonora's so much. Bloodblade Dance is the guddest I can hit 😂
    Boy, it's a good thing I boosted every special weapon to +9 because I think this one will actually get some use from me now!
        Yeah, I'm doing a "magical bonk" build, currently dual-wielding Royal Greatswords at NG+2 while going for every ending, and while my trusty ultras are usually enough, I keep that Cheesingstar Beast Jaw in my pocket for especially annoying fights.
It's not, you spend half the time running after it.
    And then by the time you catch it, all your stamina is gone so you can’t even get the max hits in before it runs away again
        And the distances you had to run! It was SO FAR AWAY, and when you reached it half the time it was instantly in the sky or on the other side again. Why wasnt the arena at least a little smaller?
I found the unga-bunga fine. Here's my history:

My first character was a blocky-boy. I held my shield up and took light chip damage to everything Radagon and Beast could do (except grabs, had to fatroll the grabs to save a flask charge). He did up to NG+2 without me having to learn Radagon's moveset in the least, just equipped a Fingerprint shield, the scaled set, and anything thrusting.

My second character was a giga-bonk (dual colossal maces) unga build and beat the game with them at \~level 100-115. I was really worried about never learning Radagon before. Here's a hint, his face hates being smashed. Actually, everything seemed to hate having their faces smashed in by 4 colossal hammers. I don't know if I landed a single dodge on him, I just spammed jump-smash until he hit me, let my mimic grab aggro and flasked. Then resumed jump-smashing. I had 10 flask charges total, at +5. I used 7 charges on Radagon.

Elden Beast was weak to bonk too. I whiffed three of his 4-hit holy slash combo (again, I've never dodged before) and had to heal up from 5% HP, but he died really fast and didn't get to do very much. If you can do the ring jump once or twice, that's all it takes (hint for melee, run directly away from where he air-twirlies. He will resurface directly in front of you after you jump the ring. Bonk his brains out, *unload that stamina bar in his stupid swimming face hole*.)
I was so frustrated on elden beast then I equipped pearldrake talisman +2 and haligdrake talisman +2 and it was so much better. You can also mix a wondrous physick to absorb non physical damage and damage from a spell. All this made me beat Elden Beast first try in NG+ after struggling without
[deleted]
    Same. Rip on magic all you want, but I’m out here healing, swinging giant frost greatswords, cosplaying goku, sniping enemies with a greatbow, raining down meteors and hellfire, and shooting a fucking moon at my enemies. It’s so much fun that I don’t care if it’s not the true souls experience.
Elden Beast feels lika a fight designed to be fought on horse... It's not that difficult, IMO, but so fucking annoying to keep running after it
I’m happy for you, or sorry that happened. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m about to face the Elden Beast for the 200th time. This ones it, I can feel it.
    [deleted]
        Stop. Come back tomorrow and suddenly and inexplicably one shot him. This is the way.
        That’s happened to me a few times over the last week with Fire Giant. I’ll get him soon. I can taste it.
    Don't forget to come back and let us celebrate with you when you win!
    I have a Faith built using a sacred hammer and longsword along with the brass shield. 

Radagon phase: summoned Tiche (black flame does wonders on gods), was about shield and counterattacks, along with matching talismans (curved sword, crimson assassin...). Very important: I used the divine protection, the one provided by Sir Gideon Ofnir after being defeated, it significantly lowers the damage taken.

Beast phase: divine protection cast, then switching to Radagon's Icon, the incantation buff talisman, close up and using the pest's needles incantation. It obliterates huge enemies taking all the needles (works very nicely with dragons as well). The rest of the time, I run away from the Elden stars and huge aoe, and keep on raising my shield when getting close to it.

You'll block holy at 98.7%, and what gets through won't hurt to much.  Last run on NG6, I used 1 heal pot for the encounter, and I'm no amazing gamer.
I had trouble at first with the elden beast with melee. Then I found spamming strong attacks after it does it's 3 hit swipe with the sword will almost always guarantee a stagger.

        ... just not my own.
His close range dodge is only possible because of light roll, medium roll needs a even tighter frame to dodge and you might need to run closely around her while she's in the air (haven't tried medium roll with his technique yet)

I missed him in Limgrave, saw him at the festival, and saw him in the magma fields and I was able to use him in the Fire Giant fight so you can 100% skip the Limgrave one it seems.
    His quest is very forgiving. He appears generally in this order:

>!Limgrave, Gael Tunnel, Radahn, Liurnia, Mt. Gelmir, Fire Giant, and Farum Azula!<

I actually accidentally skipped him in Liurnia and still managed to finish his quest. So I would assume the important ones are probably >!Radahan, Mt Gelmir, and Farum Azula.!< That would be my guess. You do miss out on a few items if you don’t meet him and help him get unstuck.
    ^ this

In fact this is my exact experience in my playthrough actually. Was then able to complete his questline after that, in the next area past the Fire Giant.
    In 4 of 5 play throughs he hasn’t even shown up in Liurnia for me, after the festival I only find him in Mt. Gelmir after that. Once I’ve seen him in Liurnia.
He is not stuck in the lava stream. He is in there by choice. It isn't hot enough to "temper" him, however, so he seeks the giant's flame. That's why you meet him in the fire giant's boss room.
    You are right, thanks for the clarification. Had momentarily forgotten the details by this point.
I met him in limgrave and got him unstuck but I don’t think I’ve seen him since.
    Hmm, assuming you have beaten Radahn he may still be at Radahn's site of grace. Fextra says his dialogue here needs to be exhausted before he will move on to other places.

Full article for the other locations afterwards: https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Iron+Fist+Alexander
    Not sure how far you are, but you can complete his quest basically at any time it seems.

Avoiding spoilers, you see him again for the Radahn Festival in Caelid. He'll then go train somewhere hot, to temper himself. You can meet him again near a giant sky pot, inside a boss arena (as a summon). Finally, you can see him in a swirly crumbly timey wimy zone.

I think he pops up a few other places too, but those seem like the most story important places to find him.
    Probably

Should be available for fire giant at this point I believe.
Stuck in the ground in Liurnia but it’s overlooking the jar people town on top of the cliff. Need an oil pot and preferably but not required a colossal weapon
    I never found him there, but still managed to summon him for Fire Giant and then complete his questline shortly after.
I wouldn't say Torrent trivialized phase 2, but it certainly made it easier to avoid some projectiles and reposition for the floaty Sun spells. My mimic lasted just long enough for me to play patiently with Torrent for the last 20% health. Everyone's boss experiences differ, love that about these games.
True enough! I've actually had more trouble with the Giant than other late game bosses, even with Torrent. But everyone has their own style.
Horse litigation
    Let’s go toe-to-toe on horse law and see who comes out the victor.
Me too. Easier to stay under him and cling close to his legs
Seems he had really only 2 or three attacks he knew he could safely go in after. The rest of the time he was just avoiding damage which is tricky enough. 

It's almost like it's possible other attacks are also ok to counter but more risky so why try for them. Wait for the best ones. Dodge the rest. Once you learn the broadcasts, I guess that's the full package. 

That and not being a spaz which is always my problem.
    See what I do is an advanced technique you probably haven’t heard of. I do the exact same thing except I decide to just face tank a hit in exchange for a morsel of damage which causes me to miss all those openings because I’m busy getting stabbed during my sip. A true gamer strat that only worked thanks to the power of way too much vigor lmfao
    The absolute discipline is truly impressive.  That and his god-tier evasion of the Waterfowl dance point blank, plus the clone spam that got me so many times.

Then again, I guess if I fought Melania as much as this dude has, I might be better at it.
        The point blank waterfowl dodge had my mouth wide open. I didnt know you could even pull that off. I had seen people do it when they were ready and do the run away and redirect but from point blank? Amazing.
            I've seen people do it in a couple of videos, sometimes it looks like they just roll blindly and get lucky, but this was clearly an intentional and perfectly executed dodge.
                With multiplayet latency no less.
    A good way to practice is to literally just avoid their attacks as long as you can without going for a hit. Make it muscle memory. I think there's a difference in viewing the fight from someone like OP. A lot of people focus on when to attack, when they should be focusing on when to avoid. So it just becomes a battle of impatience, where you're itching to attack them and end up attacking at an inopportune time.

I'm still working my way through the game, and trying to have more patience. I've been doing mediocre.
    That was my strategy for Margit, and Manus from DS1, stand back and bait out the punishable attacks
    Yeah, he played really safe, which is risky in it's own way (the fight last longer)
    Think the ideais you don't know what comes next after her shorter attacks, if it's another short attack you'll get hit. Prob better to wait for attacks with a guaranteed cooldown.

In her 2nd form she seems to emit a short explosion for attacks with cooldowns, which is a nice tell.

Also, dude can even parry her sword attacks, did it in another run.

Edit: ah wait it wasn't this guy, it was MoonMoon who was parrying her attacks. He's a streamer I was watching beat the game at soul lv. 1. Was using a shield + katana for this fight.
It's that patience to wait, like when you know they are just one or two hits, that separate the wheat from the Chad's.
    I've been playing these since Demons Souls on PS3. Still can't resist the allure of trying to get in one more hit.
No idea about that game, but it was a very entertaining video. Thanks for sharing.
tuned in for a few minutes.. watched the whole hour.
Amen. That’s my platinum trophy sitting on the top shelf above all others. The rush. The absolute rush of finally killing her after so many times getting so close. The only other moment from a video game that can beat even souls boss victory rush.
I bet that was an amazing feeling. I couldn't handle some of the beefed up bosses in Godhome. I got there. I checked the place out. Made it through some of the rushes and some of the simpler challenges. But nah, definitely not good enough at HK to make it through that content. 😅 I was proud enough of what I did accomplish. You though. Take an upvote and my mad respect.
Wait until everyone finds out it’s actually a guitar hero guitar configured to keyboard inputs instead of controller.

                There is a YouTuber who is doing Elden Ring on the Donkey Kong bongos! ZeroLenny 😂
Does it with a million souls in the bag without getting hit too. I'm guessing he does this _a lot_
    Furled Fingers don't lose souls when they die!
    He wouldn't lose them if he died anyway...
Yeah I use kb+m I dont know why people think it's so bad

        I know I remapped the change spells to one of my mouse buttons since hitting the arrows on my keyboard was just not reasonable most times. But I wound up beating the game and achievement bosses barely swinging my sword save for Blasphemous blade's ash of war but even then that was desperation mode. Otherwise it was just throw a fireball and watch my skeletons die in the corner.
            > watch my skeletons die in the corner

And resurrect. And die. And resurrect.

For as awesome as Tiche can be, nothing carries harder than Lloyd and Harry do, my trusty if stupid skeleton militamen.
            Yep. My mouse wheel is changing flasks/consumable and also changing incants. Also makes it easy to get on torrent as I have that set to E+mwheel
        "How tough are ya?"

"I beat Malenia with default key bindings"

"Right this way sir!"
            It’s honestly not that hard once your hands learn WASD. Movement in any game pretty much feels natural. Also a mouse has better aim.
                Most PC gamers are going to be completely familiar with WASD. Even with that, the \*other\* default bindings are insane in ER. 'F' to jump? To run and jump attack someone, you would have to hold 'W' + Space + Shift + Mouse Button. It's crazy. Using your pouch requires taking your hand off the mouse and using directional arrows, while also using 'E'. I'm convinced they were chosen by/for Ranni.
    Started DS3 on mouse and keyboard so couldnt adapt for bloodborne. Beat DS2 sotfs, sekiro, and now Elden Ring all on mouse and keyboard, dunno what the issue is?
        Original souls games had terrible PC ports where using KB+M was absolutely horrendous.

They've been better about it in their more recent titles, but the stigma around them remains.
            That is fair, Scholar of the first sin re-release still needed a lot of keys re-bound
        You beat Ds2 on Mouse and keyboard? Respect, that port is anus. Not as bad as the DS1, wherein Heavy Attack was bound to 'H'
    Dark Souls : prepare to die edition is why.
    For me it's mostly two things:

* Mouse camera control was clearly done by a developer who had only a wikipedia article to figure out what a "mouse" is. And he accidentally used the one for the animal, of course.
* Keyboard doesn't let you bind individual actions, rather it forces you to use the some artificial combos as the controller *needs*. But it's a need there, so on the controller it's somewhat understandable. On KB, something as basic as dodge and sprint being on the same button just annoys the piss out of me somehow. I got more than enough buttons, let me actually use them!
KBM is better for me than controller, the only Soulsborne game I willingly choose to play with a controller is DS2 and that is only because I don't want to completely rewrite my muscle memory to play it, otherwise KBM is better for it as well
The controls are just designed around it. Rotating the camera around the player works better as an analog stick rather than mouse and analog sticks can have movement input possibilities that are more than just a digital (0 or 1) input of up/down/left/right.

Handling items and stuff are also probably easier on controller d-pad, but it's probably not bad on keyboard.

The biggest thing though is that FromSoft games did not work well for keyboard and mouse for a very long time. Dark Souls 1 on PC required a fan patch (DS Fix) to work. DS2 may have also. I think 3 worked out of the box, but it wasn't ideal. The game's community has grown up around the understanding controller is ideal, even on PC. Even if that perception is incorrect now (idk if it is), it's going to take a long time to change.
    Handling items is significantly easier on keyboard IMO, and a [trackball mouse](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61QrqZ8uurL._AC_SL1500_.jpg) handles the camera better than the analog stick does
    [deleted]
    [deleted]
It’s not necessarily, it comes down to preference. If someone has played the previous games on all console, a controller probably feels better. Some people really excel in games with KB+M.
Keyboard inputs are all or nothing, which isn't great for finer control that these games typically require. Some people make it work.
Feelin’ good on a Wednesday….!

    If you've got frost pots you can knock her out of waterfowl dance 2x in the fight before she's immune
Bruh what are you doing? Play the damn game!
    It's on the list man.  Don't get old, it sucks, you don't have time for anything fun.
FromSoft combat is a dance. Step at the right time, and the fight is effortless. Miss your cue and you're getting your foot stepped on.
there's always another secret
I have done it a single time at medium through dumb luck, so it is definitely doable, but incredibly difficult.
    Removing the lock on helps with medium roll, but its still incredibly hard

    Unlocking and run bait in circle is the most common way to avoid but also the hardest to do so not what we are talking about here.
I'd pay a lot of money to see Malenia take a Stunner.
    Bah gawd thats Jarhead's music!!
        ILL DO IT WITH 1 BEER *WHAT* 2 BEERS *WHAT* 3 BEERS *WHAT* A SHOT OF WHISKEY *WHAT* A MARGARITA *WHAT* A BLOODY MARY *WHAT* A JAR ON MY HEAD *WHAT* IN MY UNDERWEAR *WHAT*

    “Bah gawd no, she’s setting up for the Waterfowl Dance! That damned Dance, I don’t think the Tarnishe-STUNNER! STUNNER! STUNNER! STUNNER!”
OH HELL YEAH
This right here and have audio from jr about how she has a family and BY GAWD SHES BROKEN IN HALF when he bleeds the bitch
Well, that was unsettling.
    Yeah. I correct people so much they think it's how I greet people.
He was born in it!
    Also molded by it
        He did not see the grace until he beat the game and by then it was nothing to him but BLINDING
            I absolutely believe this individual to do a no-grace run.
Do you think that's 'git gud' you're breathing?
    Stop trying to 'git gud' and 'git gud'!
If I take that "git gud" off your face, will you die?
    It would be extremely painful
        You're a big jar
            For you
*Law and Order* ***Dong Dong***
Eleanoras pole blade is also great if you want to have a stagger party.  It has a godlike weapon art that does insane poise damage, stacks bleed, is super mobile and is one of the most fun weapon arts to use IMO.
    That thing also gives you poise and I-frames, it's insane.
    Yeah, it's not a big bonk stick though. Therefore, no unga bunga, and no unga bunga = no fun.
    I looove Eleonora's so much. Bloodblade Dance is the guddest I can hit 😂
Boy, it's a good thing I boosted every special weapon to +9 because I think this one will actually get some use from me now!
    Yeah, I'm doing a "magical bonk" build, currently dual-wielding Royal Greatswords at NG+2 while going for every ending, and while my trusty ultras are usually enough, I keep that Cheesingstar Beast Jaw in my pocket for especially annoying fights.
And then by the time you catch it, all your stamina is gone so you can’t even get the max hits in before it runs away again
    And the distances you had to run! It was SO FAR AWAY, and when you reached it half the time it was instantly in the sky or on the other side again. Why wasnt the arena at least a little smaller?
Same. Rip on magic all you want, but I’m out here healing, swinging giant frost greatswords, cosplaying goku, sniping enemies with a greatbow, raining down meteors and hellfire, and shooting a fucking moon at my enemies. It’s so much fun that I don’t care if it’s not the true souls experience.
[deleted]
    Stop. Come back tomorrow and suddenly and inexplicably one shot him. This is the way.
    That’s happened to me a few times over the last week with Fire Giant. I’ll get him soon. I can taste it.
Don't forget to come back and let us celebrate with you when you win!
I have a Faith built using a sacred hammer and longsword along with the brass shield. 

Radagon phase: summoned Tiche (black flame does wonders on gods), was about shield and counterattacks, along with matching talismans (curved sword, crimson assassin...). Very important: I used the divine protection, the one provided by Sir Gideon Ofnir after being defeated, it significantly lowers the damage taken.

Beast phase: divine protection cast, then switching to Radagon's Icon, the incantation buff talisman, close up and using the pest's needles incantation. It obliterates huge enemies taking all the needles (works very nicely with dragons as well). The rest of the time, I run away from the Elden stars and huge aoe, and keep on raising my shield when getting close to it.
Do this

Halgitree Crest Shield +25 with the holy mitigation ashes.

Ijis Mirror Helm
Crucible Tree Armour 
Tree Sentinel Gauntlets
Tree Sentinel Greaves

Tailsman 
Pearl Drake Tailsman +2
Haligdrake Tailsman +2

If needed for wearing all this (to stay medium weight)

Tailsman 
Endrees Favor +1
Great-Jars Arsenal 

Cast
Golden vow
Lords Divine Fortification 

You'll block holy at 98.7%, and what gets through won't hurt to much.  Last run on NG6, I used 1 heal pot for the encounter, and I'm no amazing gamer.

His quest is very forgiving. He appears generally in this order:

>!Limgrave, Gael Tunnel, Radahn, Liurnia, Mt. Gelmir, Fire Giant, and Farum Azula!<

I actually accidentally skipped him in Liurnia and still managed to finish his quest. So I would assume the important ones are probably >!Radahan, Mt Gelmir, and Farum Azula.!< That would be my guess. You do miss out on a few items if you don’t meet him and help him get unstuck.
^ this

In fact this is my exact experience in my playthrough actually. Was then able to complete his questline after that, in the next area past the Fire Giant.
In 4 of 5 play throughs he hasn’t even shown up in Liurnia for me, after the festival I only find him in Mt. Gelmir after that. Once I’ve seen him in Liurnia.
You are right, thanks for the clarification. Had momentarily forgotten the details by this point.
Hmm, assuming you have beaten Radahn he may still be at Radahn's site of grace. Fextra says his dialogue here needs to be exhausted before he will move on to other places.

Full article for the other locations afterwards: https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Iron+Fist+Alexander
Not sure how far you are, but you can complete his quest basically at any time it seems.

Avoiding spoilers, you see him again for the Radahn Festival in Caelid. He'll then go train somewhere hot, to temper himself. You can meet him again near a giant sky pot, inside a boss arena (as a summon). Finally, you can see him in a swirly crumbly timey wimy zone.

I think he pops up a few other places too, but those seem like the most story important places to find him.
Probably 
>!talk to him at radahns’ arena may not be necessary but exhaust dialogue!<
>!find him stuck again in luirnia need oil pot. Recipe book sold by merchant in siofra river ( up scaffolding in the middle he’s hidden above the flower)!<
>!also jairburn (not sure if that’s right but jar town) is near there so look around!<
>!will find him near a fort in Mt. gelmir behind a lava wyrm!<
