[[Why doesn't torrent leave when you pursue the frenzied flame ending, like Melina Other than the obvious reasons for movement.]]





To be fair, Melina didn't choose you; Torrent did.
    Melina had doubts .Torrent never did he a real one!
    Torrent predicted it from the beginning. he knew you were going to choose the frenzied flame

He's the real mastermind. Not you. Not shabriri

Why did Torrent want to see the world burn?
I don't know but he did. 
Our mortal minds can't comprehend.
        To end his eternal cycle of being a beast of burden. He was tired and needed to be that close to the flames to break his ashes bonds to the ring.
            He'll never be your beast of burden. 

His back is broad, but it's a-hurting. 

All he wants, for you to burn down the tree.
                He’ll never (never) never (never) never (never) never leave
                He’s walked for miles, his hooves are hurting.

All he wants, for you to un-summon him please.
            Torrent after playing Path of Exile:*I am no beast of burden*
        It’s because he’s tired of all the Tarnished holding onto 400 rowa and not feeding him any snacks
            I feel personally attacked by that comment, do know that I share my drinks with him quite frequently.
        Torrent should be Elden Lord.
Who has a better story than Torrent The Spectral Steed?
    The best fucking answer.
    Torrent is a good boy
Here is what the Beast Champion Helm says:

>*The beasts, their eyes and ears covered, represent an oath: "See nothing, hear nothing, doubt nothing, and carry on, along the path set in stone.*

You can think of Torrent as a beast metaphorically eyes and ears covered since he continues to follow you despite your path.
    This really needs to be upvoted above threads like "because Horse"
        Beast in the game are representatives of loyalty… course pure loyalty without love makes it end bad for most beasts and beast-men…. Poor deathroot eating wolf man
            
>Poor deathroot eating wolf man

And back riding ghost kitty man
                Who?
                    Serosh
        I prefer to believe that torrent wants to see the world burn. haha
        I mean, it's by far the most interesting comment but I think referring to Torrent as a "beast" like the description suggests is a bit of a stretch.
            A stretch ? Torrent looks like a wildebeest and that’s why I think beast fits
                "Beasts" are a distinct categorization in Elden Ring lore, however. There are beasts, like the wild dogs and bears, and then there are Beasts like Gurranq.
                I'd still question it contextually to the game itself. 

For instance the [Beast Crest Heater Shield](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Beast+Crest+Heater+Shield) looks closer to something like a lion of some kind which matches the iconography of the Beast Champion set. The shield description also reads:

> *Features a beast as its crest, serving to remind warriors not to
succumb to the arousal of battle. Fight with passion, but become
not its prisoner.*

I'm sure you could interpret it in a way that could fit Torrent, but I just don't really feel like Torrent fits the bill of a beast.
                    I disagree. The cosmic gold-and-black fish of the Golden Order is known as "Elden Beast".
                        The Elden Beast isn't connected to the beast symbology in the Lands Between though. Nobody thinks of the Elden Beas in that context because *nobody* beyond Marika/Radagon, the Two Fingers and us knows about it's existence. 

In any case, you also see [beasts](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/file/Elden-Ring/beast_champion_helm_elden_ring_wiki_guide_200px.png) adorning the set which is shown to be a type of lion/wolf which it's commonly depicted as.
                            Beasts are not just connected to lion/wolf symbology in the game either. They have connections to strength (the bestial incantations, clawmark seal, beastman's cleaver) and Torrent chooses us, the tarnished who goes on to become a lord. Beasts are also connect to having knowledge beyond human ken. You can argue Torrent posses a knowledge/intelligence beyond human ken when Melina says this:

>*"Forgive me. I've been...testing you. To see whether or not grace truly does guide you. And...whether you are fit to face the challenge that entails. It seems my worries were unfounded. **Torrent had your measure from the very start whereas I merely pretended**"*

Edit: The reason you see the lion symbology so much on many items is cause Serosh was the **Lord of Beasts** and Serosh is a lion so he probably became a representative for beasts (such as how a president is often the image for a country).
                                > Beasts are not just connected to lion/wolf symbology in the game either. 

But you followed all of it up with items related to the beastmen. Virtually everything beast-related traces back to the beastmen one way or another. 

For instance, [Cinquedea](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Cinquedea#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=farum%20azula&gsc.sort=) represents the beast's five fingers which is symbolic of the intelligence granted to them.

Then you have [Beastclaw Greathammer](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Beastclaw+Greathammer) telling us that Serosh was once the Lord of *Beasts* before becoming Godfrey's regent. Aside from Serosh we also have Gurranq who has the title of Beast Clergyman and teaches bestial incantations. 

It's true that [Beastman's Cleaver](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Beastman's+Cleaver) tells us that they possess knowledge beyond human ken, and with that knowledge they eventually felt their wildness slipping away.

[Bestial Vitality](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Bestial+Vitality)

> *Having gained intelligence, the beasts must have felt how their wildness slipped away as civilization took hold.*

Something which the [Beast Crest Heater Shield](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Beast+Crest+Heater+Shield) draws from with:

> *Features a beast as its crest,* ***serving to remind warriors not to
succumb to the arousal of battle.*** *Fight with passion, but become
not its prisoner.*

Which lastly brings us to the Beast Champion set which is adorned with conventional beast-like figures which matches every other instance of beasthood - drawing it's inspiration from the beastmen. 

And in any case, I'm just curious how the armor otherwise relates to owner, Bernahl, given the metaphor is seemingly about Torrent.
                                    Why couldn’t the Tarnished have a different type of “Beast” (maybe not called that but serves the same purpose) than the Empyreans? Ranni got Blaidd, Markia got Maliketh. Intelligent beasts with undying loyalty. Is it so crazy to think that someone made Torrent to serve a similar purpose. The person set to become the next Elden Lord getting what the Empyreans get? Yes you are Tarnished. Lower than Empyreans. So you don’t get a talking wolf man to defend you and carry out your deeds. You simply get a horse smart enough to choose you. It’s not that Torrent is exactly the same as the other beasts, but serves a similar purpose to a different “faction” (for lack of a better word).
                                    Strength and Intelligence is a characteristic that follows beasts in general in the game. The Ruins Greatsword is a STR/INT from the Beastmen's home, Fallingstar Beast jaw is another STR/INT weapons, Serosh being the Lord of Beasts is resemince of Strength and Intelligence (fighting with passion and guiding the golden lineage) and much more. This is why I consider Torrent a beast as well cause he has those connections to strength and intelligence which I described earlier.  But of course this hypothesis will never be complete and will have holes due to the vagueness/lack of information in the game and because that's how it be sometimes.
                            Heheheh elden bees
                    That heavily sounds like Serosh. His job is to tame Godfrey
                Yes he is, but he also chooses you at the beginning of the game.
                [removed]
            Aw but it’s so delightfully camp tho; his eyes and ears are *literally* covered.
            Beast doesn't just refer to lions and tigers, horses and donkeys are also known as beasts. So Torrent being a mix of a few things, is considered a Beast.

        Backsplanation much? The real reason is obviously because horse. If the lore fits then that’s just convenient or they made it fit.
        I mean yea that's 100% the lore implication. But like it's also kinda because horse. Which honestly they could have pulled torrent from you. It would have made the frenzied ending more impactful. Would have made choosing that more decisive. Like what you've done has consequences. Which would have set the tone better. But it's also hard to do that when taking the frenzied flame and ending the game could be 40 hours apart. I mean honestly I have no idea how quickly they can be done. But that was my personal experience.
    Wasn't it stated that he chose you though?  Did he just do it randomly then?
        There is another comment made by someone else down below who had the same idea. But the Beast Champion armor says

> *" Beasts are drawn to champions, and to lords. And this armor befits a champion worthy of becoming a lord. And that is what Bernahl was. Until his maiden threw herself into the fire"*

Our character has the essence of a champion/lord so Torrent choosing us was not random.
            [deleted]
                No, our character is not a maiden. There’s a reason why we couldn’t convert runes into strength before meeting Melina…
                Erdtree existed before deathroot, and Godwyn is marikas kid, they don't have kids themselves.
                    >Godwyn is marikas kid, they don't have kids themselves.

I agree with everything you said, but isn't Godrick Godwyns kid?
                        Godrick is a descendant of Godwyn. Implying a few generations of removal but still the bloodline.   
It’s implied there were many more lesser demigods that were slain before our tarnished arrived.   
So yeah, demis and externals do fuk
                >Our character is also clearly a maiden themselves, right?

No. We are maiden-less. We only get given the power to convert runes to strength when Melina initially leaves us at the Erdtree.

>Erdtree itself is a hybrid of deathroot

No? Not sure how you arrived to that conclusion. The deathroot only appeared when Godwyn was slain in the night of the black knives. His soul was killed, but his body was not, causing it to spread throughout the lands between. The Erdtree existed aeons before this event.

>The whole game is themed around arboreal grafting

I wouldn't say that. The only grafting that happens really is around Godrick, and arguably the jar knights. Elden Ring continues the themes the other souls games have, around that of stagnation, undeath and an endless limbo caused by higher beings trying to keep the status quo.
                    \>The only grafting that happens really is around Godrick, and arguably the jar knights.

Technically speaking the Gold of the Tree is grafted on using faith in the Golden Order. The grace of gold is an illusion only seen by those with grace in the first place, the tree is long burned (the city is covered in ash)
                Dude got downvoted to shit for expressing an opinion. Sure they might be wrong and there might be evidence against it but they weren’t being a dick about it. Let’s encourage conversations rather than just downvote everything you disagree with?!
    Damn. One full year and 200 hours later, I just realized Torrent really is the bestest boy 🥲
    Question is, is Torrent a beast?  
He clearly chose us at the beginning of the game, showing that he possesses agency over who he serves.
        I agree. Torrent showing up on the DLC announcement picture gives me hope he'll be developed more as a character, at least just a little
            I reckon that torrent may shift loyalties (?) or something that will result in torrent not being with the player, making the DLC feel a bit more like other FS games with just foot traversal
                Torrent as Miquella's Shadow would be amazing
        The Beast Champion armor has this little snippet

> *Beasts are drawn to champions, and to lords*
            That's interesting, though I feel like they mainly didn't make Torrent leave you for gameplay reasons. It would've been very cool though, I find Melina leaving you great as well, gives the decision more weight and immediately makes you feel the impact on the world.
            oh I had never considered Torrent to be our Serrosh. Loux kills Serrosh to become feral again and in the Frenzied Flame it seems like we like kill torrent; granted that's probably the coincidence of us burning everything.
        So does my dog but he is still a beast
    An interesting take I hadn't considered. To add on my own, it's also possible that, if Torrent's former master is confirmed to be Miquella, Torrent might also be aware that the influence of the Frenzied Flame can be dispelled by Miquella's needle in Faram Azula. 

After all, upon reaching Faram Azula, we never get to ride Torrent again along the rest of the story path, so it seems he does what he always has and believed in you just a little longer and harder than Melina did.

I know Millicent's Prosthesis is considered the ultimate sign of betrayal in this game, but I personally think Torrent's last whinny as his ring is destroyed during the Frenzied Flame is worse.
        Makes more sense that his former master is Marika, as she's a lord (beasts are dawn to lords), and her daughter (Melina) is the one who searches for you and hands it over. Miq has no reason to have it, or to give it to Melina, or for Ranni to have known this (She, as Renna, states she knew the previous owner i.e. Marika, which we know was real because they were both involved in planning some aspect of the Night of Black Knives)

Person in the picture is a younger Marika, DLC is a prequel where we learn she knew about deathroot the whole time and tried to killed Godwyn in an attempt to prevent it, ironically sealing her fate by being betrayed by Ranni on that fateful night, leading to her helplessly shattering the Ring. Bet.
    also his eyes are literally covered, and if you take a close look at his model there are actual corks wedged in his ears. there was some cut content someone found where you could use a corkscrew to unblock his ears, and a torrent who can hear again was a whole other quest line
        Oh dam really? You got a link to the corkscrew cut content?
            i don’t have it handy but it was from an interview with grrm. apparently he is a bit of a wino and many of the beasts were meant to be essentially living barrels for aging wine. he almost had miyazaki on board by describing the grape stomping process, it got pretty far into development before he came to his senses. iirc torrent was supposed to be a malbec.
    Very interesting, and makes total sense to me.
Torrent is literally a beast of burden.
    He also literally has hair over his eyes
    Brilliant, dare I say Golden, reply.
    basically no take backs
    I have a suspicion that Miquella actually can see the future in his dream, and that whatever ending the tarnished chosen was the one he foresaw, therefore choosing to give torrent to aid that path.

Maybe his ultimate goal is to release the rune of death fully so that Goodwyn can die proper, as releasing the rune of death is bound to happen regardless of your choices.

This also follows the game's theme of "All path eventually leads to convergence"
    No he’s just dumb
    I enjoy reading this in VaatiVidya’s voice
    This is a stretch lol.. 

Why would torrent be a beast? Sure it fits exactly this post but come on
    holy shit Torrent is the fire keeper
    That explains those sheep who watched me die to the tree sentinel a thousand times.
    Torrent's a real homie
    I’d bet money Miyazaki is dunking on people who blindly follow propaganda by comparing them to beasts. It’s never simple with these stories, but the obvious interpretation of subtext is often what fans choose to ‘canonize.’
    True though, the times it died when climbing hills on “stairs”
Because he chose us, for better or worse, by Melina’s words.
    yes he now has to be with the tarnished no matter what path.
    Holy shit, this blew up over nothing. Edit: why is this getting downvoted lol, it was my comment that got a thousand upvotes??
    My god, I wish could give him a treat rn
He is your loyal steed and you provide berries. Torrent likes berries
    maybe he is loyal to the berries only
        If I start feeding him Shibiri grapes then maybe he’d still like me after inheritance
            He will become addicted to eyes and will eat yours
                Then I shall grant him eyes, to cleanse his beastly idiocy \\{ }/
            He will become the steed of chaos
                Steed of Chaos was my 80s metal band name
        I've never given even one..
            worst tarnished ever
                But he needs to be injured to eat, are you implying you let torrent get hurt?? 😮
                    Maybe he likes eating more than he dislikes getting hit? Much like us tarnished? We can trade hits but it feels damn more good to restore that HP back (without getting hit during or again) than we dislike to take trades?

+ Are you gonna let the immortal horse suffer long and dreadful starvation rather than what is but a flesh wound?
            I give my torrent berries even when he’s full hp
            You monster! I have them on my quick items
            Same. I just use a flask to revive if I have to.
        Can confirm. Source: own a dog IRL
        Ah yes a story of many animal companions
    Didn't even know you could give him berries
        If you turn the berries into raisins in your craft kit, the raisins will actually provide more HP restoration for torrent than sharing crimson flasks
    I see Torrent as an equal, he gets flasks of crimson tears same as me, on the real off chance he gets hurt. My torrent is a healthy boy, mostly because, if it's even somewhat feasible I will opt to fight on my feet. There's no place for the innocent in war.
    I have not given the animal a berry in five playthroughs. Torrent gets the passive heal from me drinking a flask and if he desires more, I shall have him stabbeth and summon him anew.
    I've never given him berries
nobody said torrent's and melina's opinion are the same in every topic in existence
    Based Torrent 😳
        NO TORRENT DONT SAY THE M-WORD.

M-M-Maidenless.

NOOOOOOOOO
    So Torrent's just okay with us literally ending the world.
        What a good friend I love Torrent
        indeed
        Yes
Because he is lonely.
    #Juan
        Jorge
            Jaquin
            That's what I named my first character
            That man is gonna die on a suicide mission having to set a bomb of manually to rescue humanity.

Torrent is a beast, which kinda imprint on champions and lords. Hes loyal to you above all else. 

*Beasts are drawn to champions, and to lords*

*Silver helm engraved with tiny beasts. Worn by Bernahl the Recusant.*

*The beasts, their eyes and ears covered, represent an oath: "See nothing, hear nothing, doubt nothing, and carry on, along the path set in stone."*

Beasts are good boys
    Most of the great warriors have a bestial companion in the lands between. Godfrey and Serosh, Radahn and Leonard, Ranni and Blaidd, Marika and Maliketh, Rykard and the serpent, Nepheli and the stormhawk king, presumably Miquella and torrent, Radagon and his wolves.
Wait a minute…if Torrent had our measure from the very start, and we choose the Frenzy Flame ending, doesn’t that mean he knew it was our destiny all along? HMMMM 🤨
    EXACTLY WHAT I WAS THINKING LOLL
        What if torrent knew we wanted to burn the erdtree, and doing so would somehow help him get closer to his former owner/master Miquella? :O pls more dlc hurry
            Torrent just vibing with the nomad donkeys this whole time
    Cut from the Frenzied Flame ending: Torrent, sitting in the This Is Fine meme, burning Erdtree in the background window.
Because Torrent is also a supporter of the frenzied flame: [What happens when you feed torrent too many berries](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/tjyb9a/this_is_what_happens_when_you_feed_torrent_too/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)
    Lmaooo
Because for all intents and purposes, the game loads you back into the state JUST before you pursue any ending. This is done for DLC purposes and allowing you to finish up the rest of the game.

Imagine if you did burn everything to a crisp, you'd have to move to NG+ because you just nuked the entire Lands Between.
    Think they ment after you have accepted the frenzied flame but before the ending. There is that stretch after you let the hand give you a hug that she leaves but torrent stays on.
    This. I think lore wise, narrative wise, he does leave you. Or rather, you drop the ring that calls him in the Erdtree. You see the cutscene of Melina picking up his ring. But just like the game doesn’t let you play through the world you see in the ending cutscene, your character still has torrent for gameplay purposes. Narratively though, he’s gone
        When you see the ring in that cutscene, a strange, alarmed whistling noise in the background. People theorise this is torrent, calling out to you in panic as the world is engulfed in flame.
            I think he might actually die? I’m just speculating, but I wonder if we’re supposed to make a connection with Serosh dying to “unleashe” Hoarah Loux, and Maliketh dying to release Destined Death. My head canon interpretation was that Torrent was dying, you were hearing his death wail, and that Melina’s eye opening and hair color changing was her awakening in response. Not sure how well that holds up to scrutiny lol but I kind of enjoy that narrative
                I think the frenzied flame ending does kill torrent. The ring burns to nothing in Melinas hands. 
Thats why I won't choose that ending
        Oh yeah, that is torrents ring, huh? For some reason I thought that was the elden ring or destined death or something like that
    I think your decisions having consequences would be cool.
        They do, some endings are locked off or opened up because of your choices throughout the game. But Soulsborne games default to this limbo state for gameplay purposes, which I am more than happy with because it keeps me in NG+0 and allows me to co-op, farm stuff I haven't andsoforth.

Though there are consequences for burning the tree, like losing access to Leyndall in its pristine form.
            Deff better than DS1 or BB where they just smash into NG+ after the ending.
            Not nearly enough. If Melina leaves you, you should have to go find Hyetta to be able to level up because Melina simply "leaving the power to turn runes into strength" makes the whole "you don't stand a chance if you're maidenless" speal they sold us since the beginning kinda pointless. I want a return to Demon Souls/Dark Souls 3 where you NEED to access a certain NPC to level up, and taking actions that endanger your relationship with this NPC will have consequences.
                tbf hyetta is literally right across the room after melina leaves you
                > I want a return to Demon Souls/Dark Souls 3 where you NEED to access a certain NPC to level up, and taking actions that endanger your relationship with this NPC will have consequences.

The Maiden in Black and the Fire Keeper can be hit but they just come back to life a few seconds later. In Dark Souls 2, however, you can kill the Emerald Herald for good; then the only way to level up is by interacting with her gravestone, which only appears a few hours after her death and costs 2500 souls every time.
                    Never played two, but sounds very interesting.
                Marika no! Being able to lvl at bonfires again, without two loading screens (I’m still PS4), made me so happy.
                No argument here and I agree, I do love consequences in my RPG but I suppose they didn't want that. 

Maybe the DLC will introduce more of that finality!
                    I think the only issue with the Frenzied Flame is that, unless you know spoilers, it wouldn’t be fair to the player to lose the ability to level up in the same way that killing the Emerald Herald would because the player didn’t knowingly make that choice. But yeah, changing the way you level up as a consequence would be a cool experience
                        I stumbled into the Frenzy Flame unknowingly. I was playing a Strength build and using no armor, but wanted the fingerprint shield. I didn't know that interacting with the door at the bottom was unique or special as the game gave little indication I would be locked into something. Melina had not warned against the Frenzied Flame either.   


Imagine my surprise when I rested outside of the frenzy flame area and Melina was berating me for taking it. I almost restarted the game at that point, but stuck with it to the end. Read online about how to cure the frenzied flame, and ended up doing so to get Ranni's ending. It was quite the journey though.
                        Melina literally warns you before hand, so at that point it's on you
                            I forgot about that. You’re right.
            And losing access to the bolt of Gransax entirely because it disappears after you burn the tree
    They're talking about right after audience with the three fingers, not after you've beaten the final boss. Melina leaves for the rest of the game
    I My opinion, It should burn everything, i was prepared for It when i finished the game, and it felt kinda cheasy when nothing hapened.
    Would be hella cool to play on Mordor as the frenzied flame lord tho to have a fight between us and Melina, Ranni, Renalla, and maybe even Torrent choosing a new champion, Vyke or a new tarnished ready to fight against the frenzied lord before everything burns and maybe we can play as that tarnished? They did after all do something similar in Sekiro where which ending you went to decided which bosses you were fighting.

They can have very very cool what if's due to the endings potential of dlc's with the frenzied ending and the moon ending.
He's like "oh we doing this?  Chaos take the world?  That's dope.  I'm down bro."
    "Woah this chick's a total doll, tie some cans to me and we'll see the stars in style"
Because he chose you, not Melina. She agreed with Torrent. Maybe Torrent trusts you to set the world right, regardless of your choices.
Because he is a spectral being that is summoned by blowing into a special whistle, and you as the pc are the bearer of that whistle
Bros before hoes
    This is way to far down
    Bros before horse
I’d quit if I had to do all of mountaintops without da homie
He's a horse.

&#x200B;

 Ride or die til the end.
    In this case…it was die
He is good boi
Horse
Women are temporary,torrent is forever.
Bcs she leaves the ring that summons him with you

(I also think it's crazy how ppl out here just saying random shit as answers)
Because torrent is the bestest boi
Because Torrent wants to see the world burn.
because he's bound to you by oath basically.
Do you guys actually feed torrent? 800 hours in and I've never used a single rowa berry. I feel bad.
Would be cool if he became fire horse
He's a ride or die homie and that's why he gets the bestest raisins
Probably just gameplay reasons, you clearly abandoned it in the cutscene, but not having a horse would be a pain
    It's likely for gameplay reasons but you didn't abandon Torrent. You can see in the last cutscene of the Frenzied flame that Melina takes the burned whistle from the ground in the Erdtree. She also have words saying "goodbye Torrent" after you take the Frenzied Flame in the sewers so she's leaving the whistle to you.
Because he is a horse and horses are not known for basing their behaviour on a moral or ethical judgement of human decisions
Torrent is yours, not Melina's
Torrent gives no fucks
He's a horse. He doesn't care about politics.
Torrent had you figurer out from the start, Melina says so.

He knew where you would end up, and he carried you there. He wanted to watch the world burn.
Some horses just want to watch the world burn
You’re his only Rowa raisin hookup and the shakes are no fun
Sir this is a horse it doesn't understand what you are doing
we always have the option to rid ourselves of the frenzied flame. maybe torrent is holding out for that.
Isn't the movement-reason enough?
Perhaps torrent has faith that the chosen tarnished will eventually turn away from the frenzied flame, so he will be your companion on that part of the journey too. He’ll help carry you to where you can cleanse yourself of the cataclysmic mistake
Torrent chose you, the tanished. He will stick with you til the very end. He’s a good boi
Because the game devs arent gonna make you run around on foot.
He wants to see the world burn after being stuck in a whistle for like a thousand years.
Because torrent doesnt give a lemon pepper fuck and minds his own business
People are really in here trying to argue that Torrent isn’t a beast. Spirit it may be now.. but come on.
I think he knows it’s not the end, you get to keep him in NGP implying he also remembers the last run. So maybe he doesn’t mind because he knows you got unlimited try’s to get it right.
You kinda have the thing that summons him on ur finger, he can't really go anywhere
you are his master. he answers the whistle.
He got horse brain.
He’s like dogmeat in the sense he is not loyal to good or evil, he’s loyal to you
Torrent is the real level ip lady: will follow you no matter what your choices are
Cuz he’s a down-ass lette. Ride or die mofucka.
He doesn’t leave. You leave him. In the frenzy flame ending, Melina picks up his whistle from the ash, meaning you discarded it.
He is a loyal dog
Because horse 🐴
Torrent follows you because you have the ring to call him. First thing that Melina does once you burn the world is to recover it from your ashes.
Spoilers
Melina is just using you for her own gain. Torrent is the real loyal og
    She literally set herself on fire just so we could succeed my guy, I think they're both just og's put some respect on Melinas name.
Because his personality has been "fragmented" and is essentially a "shared construct" across multiple users, allowing them to circumvent the "order" of the universe and essentially "pirate" various great runes and shards. That's why he is called "Torrent"
Because he loves horsing around with us!🐴
Because, for gameplay purposes, losing him would be unfun to the player and I think there are places you can only reach with Torrent.

There may be lore implications, but let's be honest here, it's for gameplay reasons.
He chose u yet u decide to burn him and everyone else who believed in u .Another reason why frenzied flame ending is the worst ending other than dungeaters
He’s a horse
Torrent is actually black zetsu and Miquella is kaguya, the dlc is all coming together now, big tree? Dreams? 💪💪🍆💀😜🫥🥲💀😅🤣🛑🎉😅🤝😂⬇️😅💎
    I’d love this just for the reactions
    Take 18% off the top there bud
Because you touch yourself at night.
Torrent don't give no ducks, burn that mother down.
isnt melina the one that specifically wants you to become elden lord in "good" terms, kinda, by  burning the erdtree and not by the frenzy flame?

maybe torrent picked us to become elden lord but he doesnt care how we got there?
I believe torrent wants to see what happens sometimes. He's almost like an observer of some kind.
Horses and dogs. Loyal as much as honorable knight
I never gave him a berry the entire game. I feel like a monster.
Where do you want him to go
He's just along for the ride..
I’m guessing for movement purposes but you still have the whistle that calls Torrent. Maybe they are bound to it
Because he's a good boi.
Spirit logic i guess. He chose you and he has to stick with you
'Cause he's a real one
Because you still possess the ring his spirit is tied to.
same reason why we don't just straight up die when Malikath kills us
Cuz torrents like to watch the world burn
Because he's just a good boy
We're gonna see him in the dlc
He's a horse. And he's controlled with a ring in your possession. He probably has no choice in the matter.
    I don't think that's accurate, i think he chose the tarnished because he believed he could make a new order worth it and who is to say frenzied flame ending is the bad one? My head cannon is that the greater will is just as bad as any other meddling outer god and similar to Lord Gwyn and the first flame, good intentions at the start but clinging to a world that should end to make place for a new. Nothing last forever and will eventually become rotten if one tries.
Even Queen Marika, the god of this age, is against the greater will and was part in killing the first of the demigods, her own child.
good boye
Because he chose you and he's not leaving cause he's based
>!I wish he hadn’t died in frenzyflame ending. Badass fire horse transformation would have been… well, badass!<
I don't think Torrent is that bright.
Because she is not Torrents master or former master.
I actually heard Torrent saying "Let chaos take the world!!!" while he was chewing the cud in his stable.
I'm pretty sure that by the time you can get to the three fingers, Melina has already left Torrent with you as well as the ability to turn runes to strength. I think she does it at the first site of grace inside the capital.
Have you guys watched "The Lone Ranger" by Johnny Depp?Torrent is kind of similar to the White Horse (Spirit Horse) that chose the naive little brother instead of the more battle-experienced older brother to resurrect. Even Tonto(Johnny Depp) was trying to convince the horse to choose the older brother! lol

Similar scene happened in the manga! XD
Because if you look closely, Torrent has Three Fingers burn marks under his saddle.
Gameplay reason
Does anyone know why there is even a three-finger in the first place? fingers are supposedly a mechanism in place by the outer god. so why did the outer gods create three fingers in the first place to even give an option of frenzied flame ending path?
My take is that torrent always knew what you were going to do and believes it the correct choice. He choose you not Melania.
I havnt completed this game. So I trying not to spoil. But I did like run underground Lyndell, fell thru some shit, and the next thing I knew I set some girl on fire. And the hot horse girl.dissapread 🐎  goty
He is a good boy
Bro its a horse
He does right? Melina picks up the Torrent Whistle in the ending
He likes chaos.
Cuz it's a horse...
Because he's a bro over hoes
Best friend tarnished can wish for. He will be by your side to the end, even if that means his demise. All hail Torrent!
Uh, because he's a horse...
I think it´s bound to the summoning whistle, and since we have it no leaving for it.
Because he is a horse
Cuz he goodboi
The obvious reason. Lore consistency isn’t a higher priority than the collective anger of the player base.
Proly the only thing you can trust who always has your back are the horses of the lands between. Look at Radahn and his mighty horse Leonard, even with her sisters flower aids he never once thought of devouring his best friend despite him losing his mind overtime.
>!He wont leave your side but he does dies when you become Lord of the Frenzied Flame. If Melina is alive she will pick up his whistle in the cutscene and you can hear it slowly fading away! You monster.!<
He chose u he staying till the end
Shibiri raisins
Because Torrent is a good loyal boi :3
Why does my pet dog not leave me when I start sending pipe bombs to us government officials
He's a horse. A ghost one. He doesn't care.
Cuz he believes in you !
Torrent be like, " Bros before gloom eyed hoes."
he stoopid
Because Dog
My guess is because he's the bestest boy in the Lands Between.
Because you don't actually "live" in the endings after you get them. When you get the frenzied flame torrent is dead so.
Because either way she leaves you torrent and she technically left before then after you first visit the erdtree when you get to the frenzied flame part she'll just bounce completely from you and I can't remember if she says that she leaves you torrent at that point. I may be wrong.
Because he trusted you to save the world AND that ungrateful b\*tch by using the gold needle lol.
Because torrent makes their own decisions, just because he traveled with Melina before doesn’t mean he has to now. He choose the tarnished that’s why he travels with you it isn’t because Melina travels with you.
It was an inside job all along
Gotta remember Melina says Torrent had you pegged for the good work Melina wanted done, before Melina pegged you for it. Somewhere when she approaches you in the intro atop Torrent, she says something like, "you knew their mark before I" or some such statement.

It's entirely probable Torrent knew the Tarnished was going to instigate great change and intended to see it through. For all our bickering after all, I haven't seen a lot of talk about Torrent despite the implications that Torrent very much has their own point of view.
Torrent has no moral compass. He's a horse.

Also, i will leave you with this: *"Torrent had your measure from the start, whereas i merely pretended"*. Torrent knows, bro
Because he's a spirit bound to the ring. Whoever has the ring is Torrent's master. Torrent doesn't actually get a say in the matter.
Because Torrent lives to cause problems on purpose
I'm pretty sure Torrent is necessary for any ending to happen. As the new bud of the new order must sprout from his horn.
Because the game world doesn't actually change after the ending. Like at all.

Doesn't matter what you choose, Roderika and Hewg don't mention it, the erdtree is still standing there in Lyndell, etc.

I wish they forced you into a ng+ cycle if you choose FF. The world should be... Gone
Honse
He likes us.
You answered your own question “movement”
Because he a day 1 ride or die…if we don’t get more torrent lore I’m gonna be upset
Remember, Torrent believed in you/us before Melina did. Perhaps he's fine with watching the world burn!
Because he’s your friend.
He a crazy hoe too.
"Torrent hath quite the ruffian chosen..."
 

Torrent didn't pick the Tarnished these lands needed, he picked the one it deserved.
Because torrent secretly wants to see the world burn. 

I usually never do ng+ but I'm going to with elden ring just so that I can let chaos take the world. It's such a metal ending.
Ra /⁰0~ Q a q.
He’s a horse…..
Torrent is a spirit steed and we don’t really know his motives. I would speculate that his former master (Miquella) was opposed to the GW/fingers and torrent commits to the Tarnished for that hope of resistance.  It’s also possible that he stays because he isn’t an Empyrean, whereas Melina is just the avatar of Marika.
Why should he? He isnt Melina.
Because Torrent has it’s own mind and chose you. If you recall when you first meet Melina, she tells you how she didn’t believe you were the one, but Torrent picked you from the start. Right there asserts that Torret’s mind is it’s own and separate from Melina
Would've been cool if you got a fiery horse in his place
My brother in Christ he’s a donkey.
Torrent chose you for reason's that are not known and they are clearly not the same as Melina's. Torrent also does not belong to Melina. They were just going the same way when they found you. The DLC announcement implies Torrent may have belonged to Miquella or Marika depending on how you interpret that image, but that's still speculation.
If Torrent staying with you after Frenzied Flame is lore-based and not just a game mechanic necessity, it may just show that his goal isn't at odds with any faction you choose and instead goes beyond that. Could be he's just looking for a strong tarnished and doesn't care how they get that strength. The end justifies the means kind of thing.
I would say it's because Torrent literally chose you as the one who should be followed. Melina decided to lead you in a direction she thought is right based on the Torrent's decision. However it may be that she didn't understand the reasoning behind your relation with Torrent. Melina had a specific goal while Torrent could choose you just because he believed that you will bring current era to the end.
Melina kind of tells you, Torrent believes in you much more and earlier than she does, so presumably he just doesn't give up on you whatever you do. (An in game explanation for something very needed gameplay wise.)
I always just thought it was bc once given the ring torrent was bound to you no matter what but i really don’t know
The Elden Ring said “Nah bruh, that shits just too sad.” and corrects the timeline.
So that we can have that scene at the end of frenzied flame with Melina picking up torrent’s ring as it burns so that you can see that the first victim in your quest to burn the world was your oldest companion
>Torrent is your best friend.
He doesnt care if you take the frenzied flame, if you (accidentally of course) jump off cliffs with him or test fall damage. He just wants to be your friend

-Comment by Shitposter on [Elden Ring Wiki](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Torrent+(Spirit+Steed))
the obvious answer is the right one
Someone wasn't listening to dialogue....
Loyalty is something you wouldn’t understand
Torrent is a horse.. goat... thing. It probably doesn't have the capability to know you're about to destroy him and the world.
Melina fucking dies. Where would he go?
Cus he’s a horse and therefore dumb as shit
Torrent is like
"FUCK IT WE BALL!!!"
Keep your friends close and keep your enemies closer
Because he is a loyal very good boy
Isn’t it just because we still have the item that summons him? Am I missing something with all these serious “lore” answers lol
Please put spoiler on this bro I just started the damn game
Some horses just want to watch the world burn
Im pretty sure torrents goal is just to bring in a new age. Regardless of what age that turns out to be. The same reason the dung eater was given grace.
There's no other reason, dude.
Torrent loves you
i'm more concerned with why do we still see the guidance from grace a.k.a. the yellow petals moving towards specific directions when we start actively pursuing >!burning the mf tree to the ground!<
He helped you get it so Melina says "fuck you" to him lol
I like to think the fact that Torrent chooses us and never doubts us is because he knows what we’re doing and why we do thing things we do. 

Most players chose the Frenzied flame ending to spare Melina from burning and maybe Torrent acknowledges that and goes along with our plan for the same reason.
I thought the last scene was Melania picking up the spirit ring and it shattering into dust meaning that you're basically killed torrent
torrent is an anarchist
Because he’s your ride or die
Because ride or dies don’t quit.
Torrent and Melina are not of a mind - Torrent chooses you before Melina does, Renna makes reference to "Torrent's former master" and has items from them that Melina shows no awareness of.  They have differing goals.

Torrent could well be another Empyreans horse, or a previous Elden Lords, or your personal shadow, or an outer god, who knows.  He is mysterious. He is inscrutable.  He is a horse.
Based horse
Bc he’s a good boy
He had the measure of you from the very start.
Torrent follows you because he knows your destiny. So whatever ending you choose. In Torrents eyes it is the right one from the beginning.
Torrent knows you have the stuff to be a lord, never specified what lord exactly, just that you can be one, and that’s reason enough for him to stay
Because I keep him well fed.
Torrent just a real one
When I talked to Melina at the SoG outside that door she mentioned something about how she would never forgive me and would miss me and Torrent but would kill me someday. So once Melina hands Torrent off I would say like that’s it he on his own and dedicated to you or whatever. He chooses to be there, no loyalty to Melina or whatever.
Cause Torrent is the varnisheds best friend till the end
Torrent is a day one ride or die...Don't get much realer than that
Torrent himself said it: “ may chaos take the world”
Because bros b4 hos.
Torrent was actually a Three Finger the whole time
9/10, would smash
He has hope.

Horrifically misplaced hope, but hope non the less.
I honestly don't know if there is a super good reason other than for gameplay. But I think if there had to be one it would be as simple as Torrent stayed with you in hopes you would do the right thing. You don't really make an irreversible decision until you burn the world at the very end. And when you do, that's that. Melina recovers the ring, and since Torrent can't die, he probably figured he would stick with you until the very end. Im sure he will help Melina in her quest to hunt you down afterward, but I think he stays until the very end simply because he chose you, and wants to see that choice out to the end.
Torrent listens to andrew tate while in his free time he's broken free of the matrix
Unlike Melina who had her own agenda and doubted you, Torrent chose you from the very beginning. 
Also Torrent is a spirit. Since you have the whistle he can't really abandon you even if he objects to your actions
Because torrent's your friend till the end just like radahn's horse
This time we might actually get some more on that in the dlc.  
Torrent chose you, likely on behalf of his former master, presumably Miquella. I believe he stick with you through anything, because no matter your choices, you get closer to a goal he wants you to reach. Whatever that might be
Melina had doubts .Torrent never did he a real one!
Torrent predicted it from the beginning. he knew you were going to choose the frenzied flame

He's the real mastermind. Not you. Not shabriri

Why did Torrent want to see the world burn?
I don't know but he did. 
Our mortal minds can't comprehend.
    To end his eternal cycle of being a beast of burden. He was tired and needed to be that close to the flames to break his ashes bonds to the ring.
        He'll never be your beast of burden. 

His back is broad, but it's a-hurting. 

All he wants, for you to burn down the tree.
            He’ll never (never) never (never) never (never) never leave
            He’s walked for miles, his hooves are hurting.

All he wants, for you to un-summon him please.
        Torrent after playing Path of Exile:*I am no beast of burden*
    It’s because he’s tired of all the Tarnished holding onto 400 rowa and not feeding him any snacks
        I feel personally attacked by that comment, do know that I share my drinks with him quite frequently.
    Torrent should be Elden Lord.
Who has a better story than Torrent The Spectral Steed?
The best fucking answer.
Torrent is a good boy
This really needs to be upvoted above threads like "because Horse"
    Beast in the game are representatives of loyalty… course pure loyalty without love makes it end bad for most beasts and beast-men…. Poor deathroot eating wolf man
        
>Poor deathroot eating wolf man

And back riding ghost kitty man
            Who?
                Serosh
    I prefer to believe that torrent wants to see the world burn. haha
    I mean, it's by far the most interesting comment but I think referring to Torrent as a "beast" like the description suggests is a bit of a stretch.
        A stretch ? Torrent looks like a wildebeest and that’s why I think beast fits
            "Beasts" are a distinct categorization in Elden Ring lore, however. There are beasts, like the wild dogs and bears, and then there are Beasts like Gurranq.
            I'd still question it contextually to the game itself. 

For instance the [Beast Crest Heater Shield](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Beast+Crest+Heater+Shield) looks closer to something like a lion of some kind which matches the iconography of the Beast Champion set. The shield description also reads:

> *Features a beast as its crest, serving to remind warriors not to
succumb to the arousal of battle. Fight with passion, but become
not its prisoner.*

I'm sure you could interpret it in a way that could fit Torrent, but I just don't really feel like Torrent fits the bill of a beast.
                I disagree. The cosmic gold-and-black fish of the Golden Order is known as "Elden Beast".
                    The Elden Beast isn't connected to the beast symbology in the Lands Between though. Nobody thinks of the Elden Beas in that context because *nobody* beyond Marika/Radagon, the Two Fingers and us knows about it's existence. 

In any case, you also see [beasts](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/file/Elden-Ring/beast_champion_helm_elden_ring_wiki_guide_200px.png) adorning the set which is shown to be a type of lion/wolf which it's commonly depicted as.
                        Beasts are not just connected to lion/wolf symbology in the game either. They have connections to strength (the bestial incantations, clawmark seal, beastman's cleaver) and Torrent chooses us, the tarnished who goes on to become a lord. Beasts are also connect to having knowledge beyond human ken. You can argue Torrent posses a knowledge/intelligence beyond human ken when Melina says this:

>*"Forgive me. I've been...testing you. To see whether or not grace truly does guide you. And...whether you are fit to face the challenge that entails. It seems my worries were unfounded. **Torrent had your measure from the very start whereas I merely pretended**"*

Edit: The reason you see the lion symbology so much on many items is cause Serosh was the **Lord of Beasts** and Serosh is a lion so he probably became a representative for beasts (such as how a president is often the image for a country).
                            > Beasts are not just connected to lion/wolf symbology in the game either. 

But you followed all of it up with items related to the beastmen. Virtually everything beast-related traces back to the beastmen one way or another. 

For instance, [Cinquedea](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Cinquedea#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=farum%20azula&gsc.sort=) represents the beast's five fingers which is symbolic of the intelligence granted to them.

Then you have [Beastclaw Greathammer](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Beastclaw+Greathammer) telling us that Serosh was once the Lord of *Beasts* before becoming Godfrey's regent. Aside from Serosh we also have Gurranq who has the title of Beast Clergyman and teaches bestial incantations. 

It's true that [Beastman's Cleaver](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Beastman's+Cleaver) tells us that they possess knowledge beyond human ken, and with that knowledge they eventually felt their wildness slipping away.

[Bestial Vitality](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Bestial+Vitality)

> *Having gained intelligence, the beasts must have felt how their wildness slipped away as civilization took hold.*

Something which the [Beast Crest Heater Shield](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Beast+Crest+Heater+Shield) draws from with:

> *Features a beast as its crest,* ***serving to remind warriors not to
succumb to the arousal of battle.*** *Fight with passion, but become
not its prisoner.*

Which lastly brings us to the Beast Champion set which is adorned with conventional beast-like figures which matches every other instance of beasthood - drawing it's inspiration from the beastmen. 

And in any case, I'm just curious how the armor otherwise relates to owner, Bernahl, given the metaphor is seemingly about Torrent.
                                Why couldn’t the Tarnished have a different type of “Beast” (maybe not called that but serves the same purpose) than the Empyreans? Ranni got Blaidd, Markia got Maliketh. Intelligent beasts with undying loyalty. Is it so crazy to think that someone made Torrent to serve a similar purpose. The person set to become the next Elden Lord getting what the Empyreans get? Yes you are Tarnished. Lower than Empyreans. So you don’t get a talking wolf man to defend you and carry out your deeds. You simply get a horse smart enough to choose you. It’s not that Torrent is exactly the same as the other beasts, but serves a similar purpose to a different “faction” (for lack of a better word).
                                Strength and Intelligence is a characteristic that follows beasts in general in the game. The Ruins Greatsword is a STR/INT from the Beastmen's home, Fallingstar Beast jaw is another STR/INT weapons, Serosh being the Lord of Beasts is resemince of Strength and Intelligence (fighting with passion and guiding the golden lineage) and much more. This is why I consider Torrent a beast as well cause he has those connections to strength and intelligence which I described earlier.  But of course this hypothesis will never be complete and will have holes due to the vagueness/lack of information in the game and because that's how it be sometimes.
                        Heheheh elden bees
                That heavily sounds like Serosh. His job is to tame Godfrey
            Yes he is, but he also chooses you at the beginning of the game.
            [removed]
        Aw but it’s so delightfully camp tho; his eyes and ears are *literally* covered.
        Beast doesn't just refer to lions and tigers, horses and donkeys are also known as beasts. So Torrent being a mix of a few things, is considered a Beast.

    Backsplanation much? The real reason is obviously because horse. If the lore fits then that’s just convenient or they made it fit.
    I mean yea that's 100% the lore implication. But like it's also kinda because horse. Which honestly they could have pulled torrent from you. It would have made the frenzied ending more impactful. Would have made choosing that more decisive. Like what you've done has consequences. Which would have set the tone better. But it's also hard to do that when taking the frenzied flame and ending the game could be 40 hours apart. I mean honestly I have no idea how quickly they can be done. But that was my personal experience.
Wasn't it stated that he chose you though?  Did he just do it randomly then?
    There is another comment made by someone else down below who had the same idea. But the Beast Champion armor says

> *" Beasts are drawn to champions, and to lords. And this armor befits a champion worthy of becoming a lord. And that is what Bernahl was. Until his maiden threw herself into the fire"*

Our character has the essence of a champion/lord so Torrent choosing us was not random.
        [deleted]
            No, our character is not a maiden. There’s a reason why we couldn’t convert runes into strength before meeting Melina…
            Erdtree existed before deathroot, and Godwyn is marikas kid, they don't have kids themselves.
                >Godwyn is marikas kid, they don't have kids themselves.

I agree with everything you said, but isn't Godrick Godwyns kid?
                    Godrick is a descendant of Godwyn. Implying a few generations of removal but still the bloodline.   
It’s implied there were many more lesser demigods that were slain before our tarnished arrived.   
So yeah, demis and externals do fuk
            >Our character is also clearly a maiden themselves, right?

No. We are maiden-less. We only get given the power to convert runes to strength when Melina initially leaves us at the Erdtree.

>Erdtree itself is a hybrid of deathroot

No? Not sure how you arrived to that conclusion. The deathroot only appeared when Godwyn was slain in the night of the black knives. His soul was killed, but his body was not, causing it to spread throughout the lands between. The Erdtree existed aeons before this event.

>The whole game is themed around arboreal grafting

I wouldn't say that. The only grafting that happens really is around Godrick, and arguably the jar knights. Elden Ring continues the themes the other souls games have, around that of stagnation, undeath and an endless limbo caused by higher beings trying to keep the status quo.
                \>The only grafting that happens really is around Godrick, and arguably the jar knights.

Technically speaking the Gold of the Tree is grafted on using faith in the Golden Order. The grace of gold is an illusion only seen by those with grace in the first place, the tree is long burned (the city is covered in ash)
            Dude got downvoted to shit for expressing an opinion. Sure they might be wrong and there might be evidence against it but they weren’t being a dick about it. Let’s encourage conversations rather than just downvote everything you disagree with?!
Damn. One full year and 200 hours later, I just realized Torrent really is the bestest boy 🥲
Question is, is Torrent a beast?  
He clearly chose us at the beginning of the game, showing that he possesses agency over who he serves.
    I agree. Torrent showing up on the DLC announcement picture gives me hope he'll be developed more as a character, at least just a little
        I reckon that torrent may shift loyalties (?) or something that will result in torrent not being with the player, making the DLC feel a bit more like other FS games with just foot traversal
            Torrent as Miquella's Shadow would be amazing
    The Beast Champion armor has this little snippet

> *Beasts are drawn to champions, and to lords*
        That's interesting, though I feel like they mainly didn't make Torrent leave you for gameplay reasons. It would've been very cool though, I find Melina leaving you great as well, gives the decision more weight and immediately makes you feel the impact on the world.
        oh I had never considered Torrent to be our Serrosh. Loux kills Serrosh to become feral again and in the Frenzied Flame it seems like we like kill torrent; granted that's probably the coincidence of us burning everything.
    So does my dog but he is still a beast
An interesting take I hadn't considered. To add on my own, it's also possible that, if Torrent's former master is confirmed to be Miquella, Torrent might also be aware that the influence of the Frenzied Flame can be dispelled by Miquella's needle in Faram Azula. 

After all, upon reaching Faram Azula, we never get to ride Torrent again along the rest of the story path, so it seems he does what he always has and believed in you just a little longer and harder than Melina did.

I know Millicent's Prosthesis is considered the ultimate sign of betrayal in this game, but I personally think Torrent's last whinny as his ring is destroyed during the Frenzied Flame is worse.
    Makes more sense that his former master is Marika, as she's a lord (beasts are dawn to lords), and her daughter (Melina) is the one who searches for you and hands it over. Miq has no reason to have it, or to give it to Melina, or for Ranni to have known this (She, as Renna, states she knew the previous owner i.e. Marika, which we know was real because they were both involved in planning some aspect of the Night of Black Knives)

Person in the picture is a younger Marika, DLC is a prequel where we learn she knew about deathroot the whole time and tried to killed Godwyn in an attempt to prevent it, ironically sealing her fate by being betrayed by Ranni on that fateful night, leading to her helplessly shattering the Ring. Bet.
also his eyes are literally covered, and if you take a close look at his model there are actual corks wedged in his ears. there was some cut content someone found where you could use a corkscrew to unblock his ears, and a torrent who can hear again was a whole other quest line
    Oh dam really? You got a link to the corkscrew cut content?
        i don’t have it handy but it was from an interview with grrm. apparently he is a bit of a wino and many of the beasts were meant to be essentially living barrels for aging wine. he almost had miyazaki on board by describing the grape stomping process, it got pretty far into development before he came to his senses. iirc torrent was supposed to be a malbec.
Very interesting, and makes total sense to me.
Torrent is literally a beast of burden.
He also literally has hair over his eyes
Brilliant, dare I say Golden, reply.
basically no take backs
I have a suspicion that Miquella actually can see the future in his dream, and that whatever ending the tarnished chosen was the one he foresaw, therefore choosing to give torrent to aid that path.

Maybe his ultimate goal is to release the rune of death fully so that Goodwyn can die proper, as releasing the rune of death is bound to happen regardless of your choices.

This also follows the game's theme of "All path eventually leads to convergence"
No he’s just dumb
I enjoy reading this in VaatiVidya’s voice
This is a stretch lol.. 

Why would torrent be a beast? Sure it fits exactly this post but come on
holy shit Torrent is the fire keeper
That explains those sheep who watched me die to the tree sentinel a thousand times.
Torrent's a real homie
I’d bet money Miyazaki is dunking on people who blindly follow propaganda by comparing them to beasts. It’s never simple with these stories, but the obvious interpretation of subtext is often what fans choose to ‘canonize.’
True though, the times it died when climbing hills on “stairs”
yes he now has to be with the tarnished no matter what path.
Holy shit, this blew up over nothing. Edit: why is this getting downvoted lol, it was my comment that got a thousand upvotes??
My god, I wish could give him a treat rn
maybe he is loyal to the berries only
    If I start feeding him Shibiri grapes then maybe he’d still like me after inheritance
        He will become addicted to eyes and will eat yours
            Then I shall grant him eyes, to cleanse his beastly idiocy \\{ }/
        He will become the steed of chaos
            Steed of Chaos was my 80s metal band name
    I've never given even one..
        worst tarnished ever
            But he needs to be injured to eat, are you implying you let torrent get hurt?? 😮
                Maybe he likes eating more than he dislikes getting hit? Much like us tarnished? We can trade hits but it feels damn more good to restore that HP back (without getting hit during or again) than we dislike to take trades?

+ Are you gonna let the immortal horse suffer long and dreadful starvation rather than what is but a flesh wound?
        I give my torrent berries even when he’s full hp
        You monster! I have them on my quick items
        Same. I just use a flask to revive if I have to.
    Can confirm. Source: own a dog IRL
    Ah yes a story of many animal companions
Didn't even know you could give him berries
    If you turn the berries into raisins in your craft kit, the raisins will actually provide more HP restoration for torrent than sharing crimson flasks
I see Torrent as an equal, he gets flasks of crimson tears same as me, on the real off chance he gets hurt. My torrent is a healthy boy, mostly because, if it's even somewhat feasible I will opt to fight on my feet. There's no place for the innocent in war.
I have not given the animal a berry in five playthroughs. Torrent gets the passive heal from me drinking a flask and if he desires more, I shall have him stabbeth and summon him anew.
I've never given him berries
Based Torrent 😳

Most of the great warriors have a bestial companion in the lands between. Godfrey and Serosh, Radahn and Leonard, Ranni and Blaidd, Marika and Maliketh, Rykard and the serpent, Nepheli and the stormhawk king, presumably Miquella and torrent, Radagon and his wolves.
EXACTLY WHAT I WAS THINKING LOLL
    What if torrent knew we wanted to burn the erdtree, and doing so would somehow help him get closer to his former owner/master Miquella? :O pls more dlc hurry
        Torrent just vibing with the nomad donkeys this whole time
Cut from the Frenzied Flame ending: Torrent, sitting in the This Is Fine meme, burning Erdtree in the background window.
Lmaooo
Think they ment after you have accepted the frenzied flame but before the ending. There is that stretch after you let the hand give you a hug that she leaves but torrent stays on.
This. I think lore wise, narrative wise, he does leave you. Or rather, you drop the ring that calls him in the Erdtree. You see the cutscene of Melina picking up his ring. But just like the game doesn’t let you play through the world you see in the ending cutscene, your character still has torrent for gameplay purposes. Narratively though, he’s gone
    When you see the ring in that cutscene, a strange, alarmed whistling noise in the background. People theorise this is torrent, calling out to you in panic as the world is engulfed in flame.
        I think he might actually die? I’m just speculating, but I wonder if we’re supposed to make a connection with Serosh dying to “unleashe” Hoarah Loux, and Maliketh dying to release Destined Death. My head canon interpretation was that Torrent was dying, you were hearing his death wail, and that Melina’s eye opening and hair color changing was her awakening in response. Not sure how well that holds up to scrutiny lol but I kind of enjoy that narrative
            I think the frenzied flame ending does kill torrent. The ring burns to nothing in Melinas hands. 
Thats why I won't choose that ending
    Oh yeah, that is torrents ring, huh? For some reason I thought that was the elden ring or destined death or something like that
I think your decisions having consequences would be cool.
    They do, some endings are locked off or opened up because of your choices throughout the game. But Soulsborne games default to this limbo state for gameplay purposes, which I am more than happy with because it keeps me in NG+0 and allows me to co-op, farm stuff I haven't andsoforth.

Though there are consequences for burning the tree, like losing access to Leyndall in its pristine form.
        Deff better than DS1 or BB where they just smash into NG+ after the ending.
        Not nearly enough. If Melina leaves you, you should have to go find Hyetta to be able to level up because Melina simply "leaving the power to turn runes into strength" makes the whole "you don't stand a chance if you're maidenless" speal they sold us since the beginning kinda pointless. I want a return to Demon Souls/Dark Souls 3 where you NEED to access a certain NPC to level up, and taking actions that endanger your relationship with this NPC will have consequences.
            tbf hyetta is literally right across the room after melina leaves you
            > I want a return to Demon Souls/Dark Souls 3 where you NEED to access a certain NPC to level up, and taking actions that endanger your relationship with this NPC will have consequences.

The Maiden in Black and the Fire Keeper can be hit but they just come back to life a few seconds later. In Dark Souls 2, however, you can kill the Emerald Herald for good; then the only way to level up is by interacting with her gravestone, which only appears a few hours after her death and costs 2500 souls every time.
                Never played two, but sounds very interesting.
            Marika no! Being able to lvl at bonfires again, without two loading screens (I’m still PS4), made me so happy.
            No argument here and I agree, I do love consequences in my RPG but I suppose they didn't want that. 

Maybe the DLC will introduce more of that finality!
                I think the only issue with the Frenzied Flame is that, unless you know spoilers, it wouldn’t be fair to the player to lose the ability to level up in the same way that killing the Emerald Herald would because the player didn’t knowingly make that choice. But yeah, changing the way you level up as a consequence would be a cool experience
                    I stumbled into the Frenzy Flame unknowingly. I was playing a Strength build and using no armor, but wanted the fingerprint shield. I didn't know that interacting with the door at the bottom was unique or special as the game gave little indication I would be locked into something. Melina had not warned against the Frenzied Flame either.   


Imagine my surprise when I rested outside of the frenzy flame area and Melina was berating me for taking it. I almost restarted the game at that point, but stuck with it to the end. Read online about how to cure the frenzied flame, and ended up doing so to get Ranni's ending. It was quite the journey though.
                    Melina literally warns you before hand, so at that point it's on you
                        I forgot about that. You’re right.
        And losing access to the bolt of Gransax entirely because it disappears after you burn the tree
They're talking about right after audience with the three fingers, not after you've beaten the final boss. Melina leaves for the rest of the game
I My opinion, It should burn everything, i was prepared for It when i finished the game, and it felt kinda cheasy when nothing hapened.
Would be hella cool to play on Mordor as the frenzied flame lord tho to have a fight between us and Melina, Ranni, Renalla, and maybe even Torrent choosing a new champion, Vyke or a new tarnished ready to fight against the frenzied lord before everything burns and maybe we can play as that tarnished? They did after all do something similar in Sekiro where which ending you went to decided which bosses you were fighting.

They can have very very cool what if's due to the endings potential of dlc's with the frenzied ending and the moon ending.
"Woah this chick's a total doll, tie some cans to me and we'll see the stars in style"
This is way to far down
Bros before horse
In this case…it was die
It's likely for gameplay reasons but you didn't abandon Torrent. You can see in the last cutscene of the Frenzied flame that Melina takes the burned whistle from the ground in the Erdtree. She also have words saying "goodbye Torrent" after you take the Frenzied Flame in the sewers so she's leaving the whistle to you.
She literally set herself on fire just so we could succeed my guy, I think they're both just og's put some respect on Melinas name.
I’d love this just for the reactions
Take 18% off the top there bud
I don't think that's accurate, i think he chose the tarnished because he believed he could make a new order worth it and who is to say frenzied flame ending is the bad one? My head cannon is that the greater will is just as bad as any other meddling outer god and similar to Lord Gwyn and the first flame, good intentions at the start but clinging to a world that should end to make place for a new. Nothing last forever and will eventually become rotten if one tries.
Even Queen Marika, the god of this age, is against the greater will and was part in killing the first of the demigods, her own child.
To end his eternal cycle of being a beast of burden. He was tired and needed to be that close to the flames to break his ashes bonds to the ring.
    He'll never be your beast of burden. 

His back is broad, but it's a-hurting. 

All he wants, for you to burn down the tree.
        He’ll never (never) never (never) never (never) never leave
        He’s walked for miles, his hooves are hurting.

All he wants, for you to un-summon him please.
    Torrent after playing Path of Exile:*I am no beast of burden*
It’s because he’s tired of all the Tarnished holding onto 400 rowa and not feeding him any snacks
    I feel personally attacked by that comment, do know that I share my drinks with him quite frequently.
Torrent should be Elden Lord.
Who has a better story than Torrent The Spectral Steed?
Beast in the game are representatives of loyalty… course pure loyalty without love makes it end bad for most beasts and beast-men…. Poor deathroot eating wolf man
    
>Poor deathroot eating wolf man

And back riding ghost kitty man
        Who?
            Serosh
I prefer to believe that torrent wants to see the world burn. haha
I mean, it's by far the most interesting comment but I think referring to Torrent as a "beast" like the description suggests is a bit of a stretch.
    A stretch ? Torrent looks like a wildebeest and that’s why I think beast fits
        "Beasts" are a distinct categorization in Elden Ring lore, however. There are beasts, like the wild dogs and bears, and then there are Beasts like Gurranq.
        I'd still question it contextually to the game itself. 

For instance the [Beast Crest Heater Shield](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Beast+Crest+Heater+Shield) looks closer to something like a lion of some kind which matches the iconography of the Beast Champion set. The shield description also reads:

> *Features a beast as its crest, serving to remind warriors not to
succumb to the arousal of battle. Fight with passion, but become
not its prisoner.*

I'm sure you could interpret it in a way that could fit Torrent, but I just don't really feel like Torrent fits the bill of a beast.
            I disagree. The cosmic gold-and-black fish of the Golden Order is known as "Elden Beast".
                The Elden Beast isn't connected to the beast symbology in the Lands Between though. Nobody thinks of the Elden Beas in that context because *nobody* beyond Marika/Radagon, the Two Fingers and us knows about it's existence. 

In any case, you also see [beasts](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/file/Elden-Ring/beast_champion_helm_elden_ring_wiki_guide_200px.png) adorning the set which is shown to be a type of lion/wolf which it's commonly depicted as.
                    Beasts are not just connected to lion/wolf symbology in the game either. They have connections to strength (the bestial incantations, clawmark seal, beastman's cleaver) and Torrent chooses us, the tarnished who goes on to become a lord. Beasts are also connect to having knowledge beyond human ken. You can argue Torrent posses a knowledge/intelligence beyond human ken when Melina says this:

>*"Forgive me. I've been...testing you. To see whether or not grace truly does guide you. And...whether you are fit to face the challenge that entails. It seems my worries were unfounded. **Torrent had your measure from the very start whereas I merely pretended**"*

Edit: The reason you see the lion symbology so much on many items is cause Serosh was the **Lord of Beasts** and Serosh is a lion so he probably became a representative for beasts (such as how a president is often the image for a country).
                        > Beasts are not just connected to lion/wolf symbology in the game either. 

But you followed all of it up with items related to the beastmen. Virtually everything beast-related traces back to the beastmen one way or another. 

For instance, [Cinquedea](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Cinquedea#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=farum%20azula&gsc.sort=) represents the beast's five fingers which is symbolic of the intelligence granted to them.

Then you have [Beastclaw Greathammer](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Beastclaw+Greathammer) telling us that Serosh was once the Lord of *Beasts* before becoming Godfrey's regent. Aside from Serosh we also have Gurranq who has the title of Beast Clergyman and teaches bestial incantations. 

It's true that [Beastman's Cleaver](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Beastman's+Cleaver) tells us that they possess knowledge beyond human ken, and with that knowledge they eventually felt their wildness slipping away.

[Bestial Vitality](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Bestial+Vitality)

> *Having gained intelligence, the beasts must have felt how their wildness slipped away as civilization took hold.*

Something which the [Beast Crest Heater Shield](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Beast+Crest+Heater+Shield) draws from with:

> *Features a beast as its crest,* ***serving to remind warriors not to
succumb to the arousal of battle.*** *Fight with passion, but become
not its prisoner.*

Which lastly brings us to the Beast Champion set which is adorned with conventional beast-like figures which matches every other instance of beasthood - drawing it's inspiration from the beastmen. 

And in any case, I'm just curious how the armor otherwise relates to owner, Bernahl, given the metaphor is seemingly about Torrent.
                            Why couldn’t the Tarnished have a different type of “Beast” (maybe not called that but serves the same purpose) than the Empyreans? Ranni got Blaidd, Markia got Maliketh. Intelligent beasts with undying loyalty. Is it so crazy to think that someone made Torrent to serve a similar purpose. The person set to become the next Elden Lord getting what the Empyreans get? Yes you are Tarnished. Lower than Empyreans. So you don’t get a talking wolf man to defend you and carry out your deeds. You simply get a horse smart enough to choose you. It’s not that Torrent is exactly the same as the other beasts, but serves a similar purpose to a different “faction” (for lack of a better word).
                            Strength and Intelligence is a characteristic that follows beasts in general in the game. The Ruins Greatsword is a STR/INT from the Beastmen's home, Fallingstar Beast jaw is another STR/INT weapons, Serosh being the Lord of Beasts is resemince of Strength and Intelligence (fighting with passion and guiding the golden lineage) and much more. This is why I consider Torrent a beast as well cause he has those connections to strength and intelligence which I described earlier.  But of course this hypothesis will never be complete and will have holes due to the vagueness/lack of information in the game and because that's how it be sometimes.
                    Heheheh elden bees
            That heavily sounds like Serosh. His job is to tame Godfrey
        Yes he is, but he also chooses you at the beginning of the game.
        [removed]
    Aw but it’s so delightfully camp tho; his eyes and ears are *literally* covered.
    Beast doesn't just refer to lions and tigers, horses and donkeys are also known as beasts. So Torrent being a mix of a few things, is considered a Beast.

Backsplanation much? The real reason is obviously because horse. If the lore fits then that’s just convenient or they made it fit.
I mean yea that's 100% the lore implication. But like it's also kinda because horse. Which honestly they could have pulled torrent from you. It would have made the frenzied ending more impactful. Would have made choosing that more decisive. Like what you've done has consequences. Which would have set the tone better. But it's also hard to do that when taking the frenzied flame and ending the game could be 40 hours apart. I mean honestly I have no idea how quickly they can be done. But that was my personal experience.
There is another comment made by someone else down below who had the same idea. But the Beast Champion armor says

> *" Beasts are drawn to champions, and to lords. And this armor befits a champion worthy of becoming a lord. And that is what Bernahl was. Until his maiden threw herself into the fire"*

Our character has the essence of a champion/lord so Torrent choosing us was not random.
    [deleted]
        No, our character is not a maiden. There’s a reason why we couldn’t convert runes into strength before meeting Melina…
        Erdtree existed before deathroot, and Godwyn is marikas kid, they don't have kids themselves.
            >Godwyn is marikas kid, they don't have kids themselves.

I agree with everything you said, but isn't Godrick Godwyns kid?
                Godrick is a descendant of Godwyn. Implying a few generations of removal but still the bloodline.   
It’s implied there were many more lesser demigods that were slain before our tarnished arrived.   
So yeah, demis and externals do fuk
        >Our character is also clearly a maiden themselves, right?

No. We are maiden-less. We only get given the power to convert runes to strength when Melina initially leaves us at the Erdtree.

>Erdtree itself is a hybrid of deathroot

No? Not sure how you arrived to that conclusion. The deathroot only appeared when Godwyn was slain in the night of the black knives. His soul was killed, but his body was not, causing it to spread throughout the lands between. The Erdtree existed aeons before this event.

>The whole game is themed around arboreal grafting

I wouldn't say that. The only grafting that happens really is around Godrick, and arguably the jar knights. Elden Ring continues the themes the other souls games have, around that of stagnation, undeath and an endless limbo caused by higher beings trying to keep the status quo.
            \>The only grafting that happens really is around Godrick, and arguably the jar knights.

Technically speaking the Gold of the Tree is grafted on using faith in the Golden Order. The grace of gold is an illusion only seen by those with grace in the first place, the tree is long burned (the city is covered in ash)
        Dude got downvoted to shit for expressing an opinion. Sure they might be wrong and there might be evidence against it but they weren’t being a dick about it. Let’s encourage conversations rather than just downvote everything you disagree with?!
I agree. Torrent showing up on the DLC announcement picture gives me hope he'll be developed more as a character, at least just a little
    I reckon that torrent may shift loyalties (?) or something that will result in torrent not being with the player, making the DLC feel a bit more like other FS games with just foot traversal
        Torrent as Miquella's Shadow would be amazing
The Beast Champion armor has this little snippet

> *Beasts are drawn to champions, and to lords*
    That's interesting, though I feel like they mainly didn't make Torrent leave you for gameplay reasons. It would've been very cool though, I find Melina leaving you great as well, gives the decision more weight and immediately makes you feel the impact on the world.
    oh I had never considered Torrent to be our Serrosh. Loux kills Serrosh to become feral again and in the Frenzied Flame it seems like we like kill torrent; granted that's probably the coincidence of us burning everything.
So does my dog but he is still a beast
Makes more sense that his former master is Marika, as she's a lord (beasts are dawn to lords), and her daughter (Melina) is the one who searches for you and hands it over. Miq has no reason to have it, or to give it to Melina, or for Ranni to have known this (She, as Renna, states she knew the previous owner i.e. Marika, which we know was real because they were both involved in planning some aspect of the Night of Black Knives)

            Never played two, but sounds very interesting.
        Marika no! Being able to lvl at bonfires again, without two loading screens (I’m still PS4), made me so happy.
        No argument here and I agree, I do love consequences in my RPG but I suppose they didn't want that. 

Maybe the DLC will introduce more of that finality!
            I think the only issue with the Frenzied Flame is that, unless you know spoilers, it wouldn’t be fair to the player to lose the ability to level up in the same way that killing the Emerald Herald would because the player didn’t knowingly make that choice. But yeah, changing the way you level up as a consequence would be a cool experience
                I stumbled into the Frenzy Flame unknowingly. I was playing a Strength build and using no armor, but wanted the fingerprint shield. I didn't know that interacting with the door at the bottom was unique or special as the game gave little indication I would be locked into something. Melina had not warned against the Frenzied Flame either.   


Imagine my surprise when I rested outside of the frenzy flame area and Melina was berating me for taking it. I almost restarted the game at that point, but stuck with it to the end. Read online about how to cure the frenzied flame, and ended up doing so to get Ranni's ending. It was quite the journey though.
                Melina literally warns you before hand, so at that point it's on you
                    I forgot about that. You’re right.
    And losing access to the bolt of Gransax entirely because it disappears after you burn the tree
He'll never be your beast of burden. 

His back is broad, but it's a-hurting. 

All he wants, for you to burn down the tree.
    He’ll never (never) never (never) never (never) never leave
    He’s walked for miles, his hooves are hurting.

All he wants, for you to un-summon him please.
Torrent after playing Path of Exile:*I am no beast of burden*
I feel personally attacked by that comment, do know that I share my drinks with him quite frequently.

>Poor deathroot eating wolf man

And back riding ghost kitty man
    Who?
        Serosh
A stretch ? Torrent looks like a wildebeest and that’s why I think beast fits
    "Beasts" are a distinct categorization in Elden Ring lore, however. There are beasts, like the wild dogs and bears, and then there are Beasts like Gurranq.
    I'd still question it contextually to the game itself. 

For instance the [Beast Crest Heater Shield](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Beast+Crest+Heater+Shield) looks closer to something like a lion of some kind which matches the iconography of the Beast Champion set. The shield description also reads:

> *Features a beast as its crest, serving to remind warriors not to
succumb to the arousal of battle. Fight with passion, but become
not its prisoner.*

I'm sure you could interpret it in a way that could fit Torrent, but I just don't really feel like Torrent fits the bill of a beast.
        I disagree. The cosmic gold-and-black fish of the Golden Order is known as "Elden Beast".
            The Elden Beast isn't connected to the beast symbology in the Lands Between though. Nobody thinks of the Elden Beas in that context because *nobody* beyond Marika/Radagon, the Two Fingers and us knows about it's existence. 

In any case, you also see [beasts](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/file/Elden-Ring/beast_champion_helm_elden_ring_wiki_guide_200px.png) adorning the set which is shown to be a type of lion/wolf which it's commonly depicted as.
                Beasts are not just connected to lion/wolf symbology in the game either. They have connections to strength (the bestial incantations, clawmark seal, beastman's cleaver) and Torrent chooses us, the tarnished who goes on to become a lord. Beasts are also connect to having knowledge beyond human ken. You can argue Torrent posses a knowledge/intelligence beyond human ken when Melina says this:

>*"Forgive me. I've been...testing you. To see whether or not grace truly does guide you. And...whether you are fit to face the challenge that entails. It seems my worries were unfounded. **Torrent had your measure from the very start whereas I merely pretended**"*

Edit: The reason you see the lion symbology so much on many items is cause Serosh was the **Lord of Beasts** and Serosh is a lion so he probably became a representative for beasts (such as how a president is often the image for a country).
                    > Beasts are not just connected to lion/wolf symbology in the game either. 

But you followed all of it up with items related to the beastmen. Virtually everything beast-related traces back to the beastmen one way or another. 

For instance, [Cinquedea](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Cinquedea#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=farum%20azula&gsc.sort=) represents the beast's five fingers which is symbolic of the intelligence granted to them.

Then you have [Beastclaw Greathammer](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Beastclaw+Greathammer) telling us that Serosh was once the Lord of *Beasts* before becoming Godfrey's regent. Aside from Serosh we also have Gurranq who has the title of Beast Clergyman and teaches bestial incantations. 

It's true that [Beastman's Cleaver](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Beastman's+Cleaver) tells us that they possess knowledge beyond human ken, and with that knowledge they eventually felt their wildness slipping away.

[Bestial Vitality](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Bestial+Vitality)

> *Having gained intelligence, the beasts must have felt how their wildness slipped away as civilization took hold.*

Something which the [Beast Crest Heater Shield](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Beast+Crest+Heater+Shield) draws from with:

> *Features a beast as its crest,* ***serving to remind warriors not to
succumb to the arousal of battle.*** *Fight with passion, but become
not its prisoner.*

Which lastly brings us to the Beast Champion set which is adorned with conventional beast-like figures which matches every other instance of beasthood - drawing it's inspiration from the beastmen. 

And in any case, I'm just curious how the armor otherwise relates to owner, Bernahl, given the metaphor is seemingly about Torrent.
                        Why couldn’t the Tarnished have a different type of “Beast” (maybe not called that but serves the same purpose) than the Empyreans? Ranni got Blaidd, Markia got Maliketh. Intelligent beasts with undying loyalty. Is it so crazy to think that someone made Torrent to serve a similar purpose. The person set to become the next Elden Lord getting what the Empyreans get? Yes you are Tarnished. Lower than Empyreans. So you don’t get a talking wolf man to defend you and carry out your deeds. You simply get a horse smart enough to choose you. It’s not that Torrent is exactly the same as the other beasts, but serves a similar purpose to a different “faction” (for lack of a better word).
                        Strength and Intelligence is a characteristic that follows beasts in general in the game. The Ruins Greatsword is a STR/INT from the Beastmen's home, Fallingstar Beast jaw is another STR/INT weapons, Serosh being the Lord of Beasts is resemince of Strength and Intelligence (fighting with passion and guiding the golden lineage) and much more. This is why I consider Torrent a beast as well cause he has those connections to strength and intelligence which I described earlier.  But of course this hypothesis will never be complete and will have holes due to the vagueness/lack of information in the game and because that's how it be sometimes.
                Heheheh elden bees
        That heavily sounds like Serosh. His job is to tame Godfrey
    Yes he is, but he also chooses you at the beginning of the game.
    [removed]
Aw but it’s so delightfully camp tho; his eyes and ears are *literally* covered.
Beast doesn't just refer to lions and tigers, horses and donkeys are also known as beasts. So Torrent being a mix of a few things, is considered a Beast.

He's literally a "Beast of Burden"

    No, our character is not a maiden. There’s a reason why we couldn’t convert runes into strength before meeting Melina…
    Erdtree existed before deathroot, and Godwyn is marikas kid, they don't have kids themselves.
        >Godwyn is marikas kid, they don't have kids themselves.

I agree with everything you said, but isn't Godrick Godwyns kid?
            Godrick is a descendant of Godwyn. Implying a few generations of removal but still the bloodline.   
It’s implied there were many more lesser demigods that were slain before our tarnished arrived.   
So yeah, demis and externals do fuk
    >Our character is also clearly a maiden themselves, right?

No. We are maiden-less. We only get given the power to convert runes to strength when Melina initially leaves us at the Erdtree.

>Erdtree itself is a hybrid of deathroot

No? Not sure how you arrived to that conclusion. The deathroot only appeared when Godwyn was slain in the night of the black knives. His soul was killed, but his body was not, causing it to spread throughout the lands between. The Erdtree existed aeons before this event.

>The whole game is themed around arboreal grafting

I wouldn't say that. The only grafting that happens really is around Godrick, and arguably the jar knights. Elden Ring continues the themes the other souls games have, around that of stagnation, undeath and an endless limbo caused by higher beings trying to keep the status quo.
        \>The only grafting that happens really is around Godrick, and arguably the jar knights.

Technically speaking the Gold of the Tree is grafted on using faith in the Golden Order. The grace of gold is an illusion only seen by those with grace in the first place, the tree is long burned (the city is covered in ash)
    Dude got downvoted to shit for expressing an opinion. Sure they might be wrong and there might be evidence against it but they weren’t being a dick about it. Let’s encourage conversations rather than just downvote everything you disagree with?!
I reckon that torrent may shift loyalties (?) or something that will result in torrent not being with the player, making the DLC feel a bit more like other FS games with just foot traversal
    Torrent as Miquella's Shadow would be amazing
That's interesting, though I feel like they mainly didn't make Torrent leave you for gameplay reasons. It would've been very cool though, I find Melina leaving you great as well, gives the decision more weight and immediately makes you feel the impact on the world.
oh I had never considered Torrent to be our Serrosh. Loux kills Serrosh to become feral again and in the Frenzied Flame it seems like we like kill torrent; granted that's probably the coincidence of us burning everything.
i don’t have it handy but it was from an interview with grrm. apparently he is a bit of a wino and many of the beasts were meant to be essentially living barrels for aging wine. he almost had miyazaki on board by describing the grape stomping process, it got pretty far into development before he came to his senses. iirc torrent was supposed to be a malbec.
He will become addicted to eyes and will eat yours
    Then I shall grant him eyes, to cleanse his beastly idiocy \\{ }/
He will become the steed of chaos
    Steed of Chaos was my 80s metal band name
worst tarnished ever
    But he needs to be injured to eat, are you implying you let torrent get hurt?? 😮
        Maybe he likes eating more than he dislikes getting hit? Much like us tarnished? We can trade hits but it feels damn more good to restore that HP back (without getting hit during or again) than we dislike to take trades?

+ Are you gonna let the immortal horse suffer long and dreadful starvation rather than what is but a flesh wound?
I give my torrent berries even when he’s full hp
You monster! I have them on my quick items
Same. I just use a flask to revive if I have to.
Jaquin
That's what I named my first character
That man is gonna die on a suicide mission having to set a bomb of manually to rescue humanity.
Torrent just vibing with the nomad donkeys this whole time
I think he might actually die? I’m just speculating, but I wonder if we’re supposed to make a connection with Serosh dying to “unleashe” Hoarah Loux, and Maliketh dying to release Destined Death. My head canon interpretation was that Torrent was dying, you were hearing his death wail, and that Melina’s eye opening and hair color changing was her awakening in response. Not sure how well that holds up to scrutiny lol but I kind of enjoy that narrative
    I think the frenzied flame ending does kill torrent. The ring burns to nothing in Melinas hands. 
Thats why I won't choose that ending
Deff better than DS1 or BB where they just smash into NG+ after the ending.
Not nearly enough. If Melina leaves you, you should have to go find Hyetta to be able to level up because Melina simply "leaving the power to turn runes into strength" makes the whole "you don't stand a chance if you're maidenless" speal they sold us since the beginning kinda pointless. I want a return to Demon Souls/Dark Souls 3 where you NEED to access a certain NPC to level up, and taking actions that endanger your relationship with this NPC will have consequences.
    tbf hyetta is literally right across the room after melina leaves you

I agree with everything you said, but isn't Godrick Godwyns kid?
    Godrick is a descendant of Godwyn. Implying a few generations of removal but still the bloodline.   
It’s implied there were many more lesser demigods that were slain before our tarnished arrived.   
So yeah, demis and externals do fuk
\>The only grafting that happens really is around Godrick, and arguably the jar knights.

Technically speaking the Gold of the Tree is grafted on using faith in the Golden Order. The grace of gold is an illusion only seen by those with grace in the first place, the tree is long burned (the city is covered in ash)
Maybe he likes eating more than he dislikes getting hit? Much like us tarnished? We can trade hits but it feels damn more good to restore that HP back (without getting hit during or again) than we dislike to take trades?

+ Are you gonna let the immortal horse suffer long and dreadful starvation rather than what is but a flesh wound?
Never played two, but sounds very interesting.
I think the only issue with the Frenzied Flame is that, unless you know spoilers, it wouldn’t be fair to the player to lose the ability to level up in the same way that killing the Emerald Herald would because the player didn’t knowingly make that choice. But yeah, changing the way you level up as a consequence would be a cool experience
    I stumbled into the Frenzy Flame unknowingly. I was playing a Strength build and using no armor, but wanted the fingerprint shield. I didn't know that interacting with the door at the bottom was unique or special as the game gave little indication I would be locked into something. Melina had not warned against the Frenzied Flame either.   


Imagine my surprise when I rested outside of the frenzy flame area and Melina was berating me for taking it. I almost restarted the game at that point, but stuck with it to the end. Read online about how to cure the frenzied flame, and ended up doing so to get Ranni's ending. It was quite the journey though.
    Melina literally warns you before hand, so at that point it's on you
        I forgot about that. You’re right.
The Elden Beast isn't connected to the beast symbology in the Lands Between though. Nobody thinks of the Elden Beas in that context because *nobody* beyond Marika/Radagon, the Two Fingers and us knows about it's existence. 

In any case, you also see [beasts](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/file/Elden-Ring/beast_champion_helm_elden_ring_wiki_guide_200px.png) adorning the set which is shown to be a type of lion/wolf which it's commonly depicted as.
    Beasts are not just connected to lion/wolf symbology in the game either. They have connections to strength (the bestial incantations, clawmark seal, beastman's cleaver) and Torrent chooses us, the tarnished who goes on to become a lord. Beasts are also connect to having knowledge beyond human ken. You can argue Torrent posses a knowledge/intelligence beyond human ken when Melina says this:

>*"Forgive me. I've been...testing you. To see whether or not grace truly does guide you. And...whether you are fit to face the challenge that entails. It seems my worries were unfounded. **Torrent had your measure from the very start whereas I merely pretended**"*

Edit: The reason you see the lion symbology so much on many items is cause Serosh was the **Lord of Beasts** and Serosh is a lion so he probably became a representative for beasts (such as how a president is often the image for a country).
        > Beasts are not just connected to lion/wolf symbology in the game either. 

But you followed all of it up with items related to the beastmen. Virtually everything beast-related traces back to the beastmen one way or another. 

For instance, [Cinquedea](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Cinquedea#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=farum%20azula&gsc.sort=) represents the beast's five fingers which is symbolic of the intelligence granted to them.

Then you have [Beastclaw Greathammer](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Beastclaw+Greathammer) telling us that Serosh was once the Lord of *Beasts* before becoming Godfrey's regent. Aside from Serosh we also have Gurranq who has the title of Beast Clergyman and teaches bestial incantations. 

It's true that [Beastman's Cleaver](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Beastman's+Cleaver) tells us that they possess knowledge beyond human ken, and with that knowledge they eventually felt their wildness slipping away.

[Bestial Vitality](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Bestial+Vitality)

> *Having gained intelligence, the beasts must have felt how their wildness slipped away as civilization took hold.*

Something which the [Beast Crest Heater Shield](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Beast+Crest+Heater+Shield) draws from with:

> *Features a beast as its crest,* ***serving to remind warriors not to
succumb to the arousal of battle.*** *Fight with passion, but become
not its prisoner.*

Which lastly brings us to the Beast Champion set which is adorned with conventional beast-like figures which matches every other instance of beasthood - drawing it's inspiration from the beastmen. 

And in any case, I'm just curious how the armor otherwise relates to owner, Bernahl, given the metaphor is seemingly about Torrent.
            Why couldn’t the Tarnished have a different type of “Beast” (maybe not called that but serves the same purpose) than the Empyreans? Ranni got Blaidd, Markia got Maliketh. Intelligent beasts with undying loyalty. Is it so crazy to think that someone made Torrent to serve a similar purpose. The person set to become the next Elden Lord getting what the Empyreans get? Yes you are Tarnished. Lower than Empyreans. So you don’t get a talking wolf man to defend you and carry out your deeds. You simply get a horse smart enough to choose you. It’s not that Torrent is exactly the same as the other beasts, but serves a similar purpose to a different “faction” (for lack of a better word).
            Strength and Intelligence is a characteristic that follows beasts in general in the game. The Ruins Greatsword is a STR/INT from the Beastmen's home, Fallingstar Beast jaw is another STR/INT weapons, Serosh being the Lord of Beasts is resemince of Strength and Intelligence (fighting with passion and guiding the golden lineage) and much more. This is why I consider Torrent a beast as well cause he has those connections to strength and intelligence which I described earlier.  But of course this hypothesis will never be complete and will have holes due to the vagueness/lack of information in the game and because that's how it be sometimes.
    Heheheh elden bees
