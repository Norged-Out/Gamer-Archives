[[Smash Wii U is overhated]]


Does anyone else think smash bros 4 is overhated? I understand if others don't like it but there is so much single and multi-player content to keep you busy. And it added a lot of awesome fighters like Bayonetta and Ryu. And there we're a lot of really cool stages like Mario Maker or Rainbow Road. There's just so much to love about smash 4 and I just honestly don't understand why so many people don't like it.


Smash 4/5 sorta started the idea that single player wouldn’t be important anymore.  
Smash Run was pretty fun but Smash Tour was a let down.  
Either way, once the series focuses on the roster and multiplayer mode so much the future entries sorta replace the previous. Smash WiiU replaced Smash 3DS. Ultimate replaced WiiU. And Smash 7 will replace Ultimate. They don’t offer enough to really revisit the way Melee Adventure mode or Brawl Subspace does.
    there will be no Smash 7
The Wii U in general was overhated
    definitely
Yeah idk I liked it xD
People give it flak for not being the most recent one any more, but people liked it when Ultimate didn't exist yet.
The character customizations were such a fun and interesting mechanic.
It was the first Smash game I ever played so I have a lot of good memories with it. I wish Smash Run got ported over to Ultimate.
Wii U/3DS didn't have an adventure. It was just fighting. I think that speaks for itself.
I thought you said "overrated" and was about to ask how? lol
being dominated by characters behind a pay wall made it get some deserved hate. bayo wasn't nearly as busted as metaknight, but atleast he was free. also, the only competition to bayo was also dlc. i enjoyed the game, but the competitive scene was arguably just as bad as brawl.
It gets overshadowed by Brawl
there will be no Smash 7
definitely
