[[What's With All The Recent Smash 4 Hate]]


I've noticed quite a few people on Reddit and Twitter saying Smash 4 wasn't very good and even some people flat out calling it crappy! I don't understand. Smash 4 had the best newcomers, best gameplay (until Ultimate) and so many extras. I'd love to know why people are disliking it now.

Part of it is that now that Ultimate is building off of Smash 4 and improving upon it, Smash 4 is just looking worse to a lot of people by comparison. It makes Smash 4 seem worse then it really was to them. 
    Came here to say this. Ultimate is quite literally what the developers felt they got wrong in Smash 4, with a couple new or returning mechanics like directional air dodge and parrying. By comparison, this just makes Smash 4 look incomplete and dumb to alot of people. 

I love Smash 4 regardless, but I can definitely see where people are coming from. Is it unwarrented? Mostly. Is it out of the blue? Not really.

Shiny new toy > Old broken toy
        But that shouldn't make it 'shit' or 'garbage'.  Do people consider the OG Smash for N64 shit?  Because every entry in the series has improved upon it considerably.  Compared to even it's direct sequel (Melee) it's basic af.  But that doesn't make it a bad game, just an earlier entry in the series.  Sequels improving upon their predecessors is supposed to be the natural progression of video games.
            This is the internet. Everything is the best or worst of all time. Everything is either 5 stars or 1 star. Nuance is dead. Hyperbole is king. 
                This comment is the best or worst of all time.





Just joking around, I agree for the most part. The internet favours the extremes and the limit cases.
                Only a Sith deals in absolutes.
                    But... that's an absolute.
                        Thats intended
            Well Smash is weird because many, many people will say that Melee is and will always be the best and that all are other smash games are downgrades.

&#x200B;
                Well, for a competitive player of top level, this is always going to be true. All around as a game is a completely different story.
                    But what if I scream "nostalgia" at you?
            Ya, it’s something that people seem to forget rather quickly. Granted, the staleness of Smash 4 never quite reached Brawl’s level, but towards the end here it’s definitely been noteworthy.
            It's far from being "garbage", but it seems to me like Smash 4 is receiving more hate than usual because, unlike the first three Smash games, it doesn't offer much that would make someone come back to it after its successor comes out. 64 is the starting point of the series and still feels unlike any other Smash game, Melee's technical gameplay and tournament scene will keep it going for years to come, and Brawl has Subspace. Smash 4 doesn't really seem to offer anything right now that Ultimate or another Smash game doesn't have; the only things really unique to it are Smash Tour, its take on Classic Mode and Target Blast, none of which were very well-received, and Smash Run on 3DS, which is a game that's been largely ignored anyway since the release of the Wii U version. Ultimate is the closest thing to a straight upgrade over its predecessor on all fronts we've seen from a Smash game so far, and Smash 4's reputation will suffer for it. Maybe someday people will come back around to it, but I don't really think it's going to get the same level of pseudo-revival that Brawl has gotten in the last few years.
        It's  still stupid to complain, it's only a good job if the new iteration is better than the past
        I get it, but to a casual smash player, Smash 4 is a very solid game. Great roster. Good stages. My second biggest gripe is that I can't turn off stage bosses. My biggest gripe is that Lucario is broken as sit and if you can keep him on stage past 130%, you almost one shot a 20% person and that's broken as shit.
    And once Ultimate problems become clear, people will be talking about how much they miss Sm4sh. 

It happend with Street Fighter IV and MK9.
        You don't know Smash.  They'll be talking about how much they miss Melee.
            This. It always comes back to melee
                64 smash or nothin
                    I prefer smash on the Atari 2600, thank you very much.

The Atari was the best Nintendo
                and there’s a reason for that
            I think these are two different demographics. Most Melee fans never cared so much about Sm4sh, and they won't care about Ultimate either.
                [deleted]
                    But will they play it competitively? I am not sure. Melee is so unique...
                    It's not a stretch that the 10% who said 'no' make up the majority of the hardcore players who shit on all other Smash games.  'Silent majority' is a thing after all.
                Agreed, the people who always come back to Melee are hardcore Melee fans. A lot of casual fans (like myself, although I consider myself a “hardcore” fan of Smash, just not competitive ) still love Melee but, at least for me, I don’t always come back to Melee.
                Huge Melee Fan, super stoked for Ultimate.
                None of the other games have attempted to recreate what drew the melee players to the game in the first place. Melee was extremely fast paced and had a high skill floor and ceiling, which is great for serious gamers but made the game inaccessible to a large part of the target demographic. Nintendo has since dumbed the game down quite a bit, which is great for accessing that market but loses the small minority of very competitive players in the process.
                Ehhh, I was a huge Melee fan, hated Brawl but Sm4sh was easily my favorite smash game mehanics wise at least
        What is MK9?
            Mortal Kombat 9
                Ah ok thanks, already feared I missed a new Mario Kart
                Michael Kors 9
        Honestly as long as we don’t have another Bayo situation then it’ll take a lot to get anyone who cares about the game competitively to miss Smash 4.
            Bayo was easy compared to Brawl MK, and people still say they miss Brawl, lol.

And I think we should expect at least 2014 Diddy situation.
                It’s not necessarily a matter of who was more oppressive, because the obvious answer is MK. Bayo was just so boring to watch and basically destroyed Smash 4’s competitive scene because no one wanted to watch Bayo all the time.

I’m positive we’ll have a broken ass character at launch but that’s what patches are for. Smash 4 was really close to being pretty well balanced but unfortunately was topped by Bayo.
                    I agree with everything you said, but I don't think I made my point clear.

The problem is about perception. As the time goes on, people will give less weight to Sm4sh's flaws and more weight to Ultimate's.
                    Some of these 0deaths in ult do scare me. It depends on how much of the cast they work on and whether it's possible to (S)DI out of them, but I'm not looking forward to stuff like luigi just fishing for a grab at 0% to do dthrow dair dair dthrow dair dair upB. That's just as bad as smash 4 bayo combos. If a lot of characters have 0deaths like that, I swear snake/links/pichu will literally be counter meta because they can put themselves at %s those combos don't work at.
                        The difference is that while those 0deaths in Ult are scary, they're not autocombos. Like, different SDI patterns and techs in the right direction can get you off the trail, and the aggressor does need to be ready to improvise to keep it up.

What makes it different is the fact that it's not an autocombo. That was Bayo's and Brawl IC's and Melee IC's problems--once most characters got caught in witch twist or infinite chain grab or wobbling, you might as well put your controller down because you're hardly getting out of that one.
                            Well, that puts me at ease then.
                                Yeah honestly seeing all these zero to deaths and such is getting me mad excited because I'm seeing so many options that look both challenging and rewarding to pull off. The engine for this game looks so damn clean.
                                    It does look hype, I'm just hoping there will be some real depth to the combos. I was absolutely done with smash4 because, no matter what character you picked, mario players were *always* going to fish for a grab because dthrow uptilts is true until 40-60%. Luigi was always going to do some 0-60 shit. Bayo was always going to get the same 0-death shit.

0-deaths aren't too bad, as long as they require some variation and effort. In 4 you can watch a one minute YouTube video and you'll get 0-60 luigi shit. I'm hoping ult will require at least 5 minutes and a degree of memorization that exceeds that of a goldfish to get combos off.
                    My friend thinks both Corrin and Cloud are pretty unbalanced whats your opinion on them?
                        Cloud is OP in doubles but fine everywhere else, top 5 character for sure. Corrin is decent. Nothing too OP, nothing impossible to deal with outside of a couple of matchups(Ness for one) 
                            Yeah my buddy is a great Cloud so that always got annoying haha. We dont talk much anymore though so I probably wont even be playing the new one with him 
                People miss Brawl because of SSE, not because of anything related to competitive.
                Very very few people say they miss brawl lol
                    I liked subspace emissary a lot! Like the actual levels and collecting trophies with the trophy frisbee.  I thought that was so awesome. Pretty sad they didnt make it like that for this one but oh well. 
                        Oh I definitely agree. Subspace was one of the best things to ever happen in smash

But, even with the vocal minority in this thread, brawl is widely not missed.

Melee will last forever. Brawl and smash 4 will mostly likely not
                            I feel that each Smash game has an aspect of it that it will be remembered for... Except Smash 4.

I mean, 64 was the original, the game that started it all

Melee was and still is a competitive giant and where the series really started picking up steam

Yes, Brawl undeniably had its problems, but Subspace was an extremely cool concept and I can name a number of people I personally know that went back to Brawl fairly recently just to play through that again

And Ultimate, is, well, Ultimate.

But what does Smash 4 have?  I mean, we don't know this yet but Ultimate seems to be a much better game than Smash 4.  Not to mention 4 didn't really have any memorable stuff besides the actual battles, Smash Tour was eh, very little single player content, etc...

I just feel that in a few years, Smash 4 is going to be the game that we all have forgotten/don't care about.  More so than Brawl, because even though many prefer Smash 4 (as do I) Brawl tried harder to make itself distinct.
                                This is exactly how I've felt since Ultimate was revealed. Maybe Smash 4 will be remembered for customs? Maybe? But every other game has a unique gameplay style (64, Melee) and/or great single-player content (Brawl), and Ultimate, as well as being the newest game, has everything Smash 4 had plus worthwhile single-player. 
                                I will remember it for the competitive scene, third party characters (Cloud and Ryu announcement made me cry), and the most functional online in the series (so far, let's see what Ultimate has).

Edit: also, first portable experience and amiibos (regardless of how we feel about them, they were a sucess from a Sales point of view).
                            Smash 4 only because it looks like its the basis of Ultimate otherwise I think it would last as long as Melee because of how tight it is. 
                    There is  lot of them, even in this thread, saying Sm4sh is the worse entry in the series.

Omni, which is one of my favorite smash youtubers, went as far as saying that competitively, Sm4sh and Brawl were almost the same, which doesn't make sense IMO.
        Woah, when did Mario Kart 9 come out?
            Now I want Scorpion in Mario Kart! Lol
                [Well then do I have a game for you! MK Armageddon had a kart racer mode included.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_boyufoODjI)
                    This is fucking stupid and I love it so much!
            Mortal Kombat 9
        Woah there. Sf4 is objectively better than Sf5
        See also: every legend of Zelda game before the most recent release. 
        [deleted]
            Interesting, I though AE was the most poralizing SFIV installment. Still, is the one who made me start playing it! Lol
        We wont. It hasn't been like that and wont be like that for smash. That's also why brawl is dead and now smash 4 while melee is still alive.
        When Smash Super Ultra Grand Slam Mega Battle Royale comes out all the games will pale in comparison.
            You thought 8 player smash was fun? Wait until you play **MMO smash!!!!**
        the only problems i can think of would be lack of trophies and extra like the map maker and masterpieces.
    I mean, yeah. Half my time watching the Direct videos was always spent thinking "Wow that's brilliant and obvious at the same time. Why the fuck didn't they do that in Sm4sh?" It's hard to deny that more thought and care seems to have been put into Ultimate. And if you're big on single player like me then Sm4sh didn't even look great to begin with.
        I think it's less about more thought and care being put into it and more the fact that they're not splitting their development resources so much by developing two different versions of the game.

Smash Wii U was held back so much by Smash 3DS.
            Yep, I’ll always say this. I loved Smash 3DS, and I’ll never regret the time I spent playing it in high school in the hallway with friends. But Sakurai made Smash 3DS pretty much an entirely separate game that had to be made exactly like the Wii U game, which was limited by the power of the 3DS. No Ice Climbers, etc. I’m surprised that they included 8 player Smash since it wasn’t in the 3DS version.
            At the same time, Smash 3DS's stagelist and game modes were better in a lot of ways than Smash Wii U's. Smash Run > Smash Tour, 3DS Classic > Wii U Classic, and 3DS had a lot of fantastic stages.

I'm really happy Ultimate is bringing in a lot of Smash 3DS stages, because they deserve more time in the limelight (or rather, the lifelight).
                COLORS WEAVE INTO A SPIRE OF FLAMES
    Except people have been saying these same things about smash 4 since before it was even released. Smash 4 feels like what Brawl *should* have been, but most people in the scene didn't want that, they wanted a sequel to Melee. The reason the smash 4 hate is building is because people are scared that Ultimate is still gonna feel too much like brawl (i.e. defensive meta, huge mid+low tiers with a few nasty top tiers and gatekeeper high tiers who can't touch the top tiers but smash everyone else, floaty, no combos, different tech skill). Only time will tell if that's true, and I have a feeling that on release it will be, but there are signs of life, and it looks like the dev team is at least trying to skill index the game a bit better, which is good.

` ^ tl;dr ^ `  
` v Theorizing below v `

Personally, I have a hunch that whatever ends up being smash 6, if we get one and if it's not ruined by development hell, will end up being the "best" post-melee smash.

64 feels like a (very good) proof of concept, melee feels like the refined and extended version of that concept, but lacking a lot of modern polish, and actually not super great as a game for more than 2 people to play at a time, unless you're playing 2v2, particularly if people are unevenly skilled.

Brawl feels like sakurai realized he had a huge fucking IP in his hands and tried to make an ambitious singleplayer, while trying to refocus the game on being a game for 2-4 players of varying skill. It wasn't actually a bad idea, it was just too large in scope, and most people wouldn't have predicted esports was going to be any bigger than halo 2 LANs and brood war in korea, so the emphasis on making a fighter with really advanced play probably seemed like it was counterproductive, given smash was really seen as *the party game* for a lot of people.

Smash 4 of course came much later, and yet feels iterative in comparison to brawl. The newcomers are definitely amazing on the whole (even if cloud and bayo are fucking busted), and though it tries to promote more aggressive play, it tries to without changing the brawl formula too much, which as we all know just ended up in a shieldy, jankier game. (btw OP, "best gameplay in the series"? yeah right)

It looks like Ultimate is again somewhat iterative, but that the development team has realized the significance of the esports movement (and specifically melee's role in it), and is trying to make a game that plays more aggressively again and flows better, while further eliminating execution intensive tech skill and adding damage scaling for 1v1 battles so that the game plays a bit more similar across different levels of skill and gamemodes.

Smash 6, I would bet, is once again going to iterate upon the brawl formula, but will probably once again try to recapture some of the glamor of melee highlight reels. I wouldn't be surprised if there was some way to diminish the knockback on your own moves or something in order to extend combos, or maybe some rework of final smashes to be less OP and chargable by playing well, sortof like the FS meter in ultimate but less stupid. It will also surely come with some QoL improvements for ladder play, and I would bet it will have real support from nintendo as an esport, which is something they're obviously dabbling with in Splatoon.
        What have you seen that makes you think Ultimate's meta will be defensive? All the clips I have seem make it feel super offensive heavy.
    This is probably it. I don’t hate 4, but the closer we get to the 7th, the worse 4 looks in retrospect. Plus, there were features or things in 4 that were irksome, but are being changed/fixed in ultimate. For me, it was that the stages were split between the games. I preferred playing on Wii U, while my favorite stages for 4 were on 3DS. I’m glad to have a unified game this time, which automatically makes 4 look worse. So, I agree, because we’re so close to a direct improvement, that the last games just look kinda bad at the moment.
    Ultimate pretty much makes Smash 4 look like how Smash 4 made Brawl look.
    Are people too dumb to grasp how sequels work?
        Yes. From a software development standpoint, this is like people getting mad that Nintendo is making improvements on a previous project.

I could understand someone being annoyed that "improvements" are being sold as a brand new game, but their are more than enough new features added to justify it.
We are in the Internet cycle of the last game was the worst thing ever. It goes best game ever -> overrated game -> worst game ever -> underrated gem -> best game ever. 

I constantly see this with the Zelda and Pokemon franchise. Give it a few years and you will get a bunch of nostalgic posts about how Smash 4 was the most amazing game ever.
    This is so true. The same thing happened with Brawl.
        Brawl isn’t quite getting the “best game ever” treatment, but it is getting enough “my favorite smash” posts and loooads of praise for SSE. About every week here we get A post “i actually enjoyed SSE!” To the point where they’re dropping the “unpopular opinion:” disclaimer
            I always thought Brawl was far and away the worst one. Is that an uncommon opinion?
                Pretty much nobody says it was mechanically better as far as actual gameplay mechanics go. Everyone likes SSE though, and when people's say "I liked Brawl" that (and the stage editor) is what they mean. Then people confuse that with praise for mechanics for some reason.
                    I will never say Brawl's mechanics were better than either Melee or Smash 4, and I do prefer Melee's single player adventure mode from a gameplay standpoint to SSE, but while I appreciate the ability to draw your own terrain, I missed Brawl's stage hazard options severely in its stage editor.  I literally could not re-create many of my favorite Brawl custom stages in Smash 4 because I didn't have the spikes, ladders, etc. I needed to make them.
                Not a horribly uncommon opinion but an opinion nonetheless. Having played through Smash 4 and having returned to melee, it does feel a bit clunky

To each their own really
                I think that's the common opinion, even though 64 is garbage
                    64 might be garbage in terms of actual mechanics, but it has a lot of charm. A *whole* lot of charm.
                    Hey man that’s my childhood your clocking in the face
                    Huh? 64 is second best in mechanics after Melee. It's incredibly fun to watch, its combos are so good that it's the only game to feature a combo contest, and it's relatively balanced AFAIK. I don't think anyone says 64 is garbage. Pretty soon 64 tournaments will be bigger than Smash 4 tournaments. In 7 or 8 years 64 tournaments will be bigger than Ultimate tournaments. 
            >About every week here we get A post “i actually enjoyed SSE!” To the point where they’re dropping the “unpopular opinion:” disclaimer

The thing is people are simply tired of competitive Smash players glorifying Melee so much that most people simply upvote anything that praises Brawl, which was seen as a stark contrast to Melee. There's also the small but vocal people who actually do like SSE and will always upvote anything that praises something that really was universally hated when it came out.

Lastly, Brawl came out... almost a decade ago. We've been filled with enough younger gamers now who grew up on Brawl and likely have nostalgic memories of SSE that are clouding their opinions. You honestly see this with... LOTS of games most gamers hated in the past.

I see this with Super Paper Mario, Mario Sticker Star, SSBB, hell even Metroid: Other M. This is also true with non-Nintendo games like Final fantasy 13, Resident Evil 5, and Sonic 06. 

There really should be a term for this... Where people who hated games that were pretty definitively hated in the past are somehow replaced by a small but growing number of people who, for some reason, want to simply disagree with the overwhelming opinion at the time.
        Uh

When did Brawl go through the last two phases? 
            Competitive players still hate Brawl, but you also get a lot of people talking about how great SSE was these days. 
                That tripping mechanic was a pain though :(
                so true. The vocal opinion was everyone hated SSE until talks of a new story mode surfaced and all of a sudden it was like WOW FINALLY... SSE was GREAT! typical internet 
                Yea, if you liked SSE (Which I did) there’s an argument that Brawl has the best single-player modes in the series. I prefer Melee’s but think Brawl was a close second.
                [deleted]
                    Mostly I think people just miss single player content.
                        And Coin launcher. I definitely miss coin launcher.
                            it was great until you needed those last 3 trophies for completion lol
                            Oh mannnn, I loved that game!  Much better than Smash 4's trophy rush, iirc.  (It's been so long since I had played either).
                            That coin launcher music was chill as hell too.
                    Brawl is my favorite in the series hands down.

And thats not bullshit.

Now you have.
                        I never played 4, but as someone who prefers to play Smash as a party game and not as a competitive fighter, I definitely prefer Brawl over Melee. More stages, more characters, and a stage creator? Yes please. 
                            > but as someone who prefers to play Smash as a party game and not as a competitive fighter

So like, 90% of people who play the game, including the development team?

Smash was always a party game, and Brawl was a natural evolution of that.  Zany items, crazy hazards, tripping, stage creation...so many random elements to act and react to while laughing/fighting/arguing/etc. with friends.  That's what Nintendo prefers to make and always have.

Then, as usual, a subset of the fanbase decide to take it too far and needed to prove their *LEETskillz* by counting the invincibility frames on Jiggly Puff's j.2S and began demanding recognition and next thing you know, Smash tournaments are being held and unlike *every* other competitive fighting game that uses the full scope of *all* its mechanics, Smash tourneys need to have items off, stage hazards off, assist trophies off, pokeballs off, every random element stripped away and most of the game's features and mechanics shut down just to force it to function under "competitive rules".

It's a shame Sakurai and Co. have to cater to that side of it; I wonder what Smash could have been if it *wasn't* hounded by people trying to make it Melee instead of letting it be what it's trying to be.
                                >It's a shame Sakurai and Co. have to cater to that side of it; I wonder what Smash could have been if it wasn't hounded by people trying to make it Melee instead of letting it be what it's trying to be.

A good fighting game works on multiple levels. Sure, its fun to button mash with friends in, but having a viable competitive scene also helps give the series longevity and even extra exposure and free advertising for casual gamers. Brawl was fun as as a casual game, but for many players, that wasn't enough. They wanted a game that can also be a regular at EVO too. Keep in mind, Brawl was around the time that the Fighting game franchise was starting to see a resurgence with Street Fighter IV, and as eSports were becoming more and more popular, Brawl just looked tone deaf to a lot of people. 
                            Yea I agree, I just think melee is a broken mess with no balancing. I understand most of the love is because how fast it is but still.
                                If you think Melee is a broken mess with no balancing though, why do you like Brawl?

Really the only Smash which that doesn’t apply to is Smash 4, circa 2015, but Brawl was certainly the least balanced of the original three, and no less broken than the others.
                                    This doesn’t go for everyone apparently, but I’ve experienced far less bugs and far less crazy broken combos other than meta knight.

I don’t play competitively so that’s probably why I feel it’s less broken, because every melee video I see is several characters being able to infinite combo, like ice climbers and fox and falco and crap like that.
                        Prat Brawls
                        Same actually. As a gamer who is bad at fighting games, I’ll never get into the competitive side. I can understand why the competitive players didn’t like it but I thought it was really fun and SSE was a really unique and entertaining campaign.
                    SSE is one of the most important things to me for smash so brawl may stay my favorite 
                    Personally I prefer the floatier gameplay of Brawl and Smash 4 is kinda similar but ruined some characters/stages and the AI for me. Also, no offline tournament mode?

Ultimate is looking good though, since it sounds like they fixed some of the problems I had with Sm4sh, but I haven't tried it yet.
                        As far as I can tell it fixes pretty much every shortcoming of Sm4sh.
                    Well let me change that for you.

I have played every smash game since the 64 one. In fact, the Nintendo 64 smash brothers was the first video game I ever played, period. That said, Brawl is the greatest of the series so far. It looks like this new one has a chance of changing that, but it's not out yet, so we'll just have to wait and see.

                            Brawl is surely the worst tournament game, but as a casual game it has more stages and fighters than melee, and better single player content than SSB4. 
                                as a casual game my friends and I will probably never stop playing melee just because thats what we grew up on. I think brawl's art style aged really badly; it looks horrible while melee looks ok and 64 has its goofy charm.

The single player content was a lot of fun but i also played that 11 years ago and i doubt i would have as much fun now lol
                            I think you forget that competitive players are a very loud, but very very tiny minority of the players of smash.

99% of players would look at you like you're speaking a different language as soon as you mention project M

Edit: words are hard 
                            Fun fact, the internet is full of people willing to share opinions that differ from the majority of people. They also speak loudly.

(I like Brawl too, but its because I really don't like multiplayer and Brawl had a shitload more to do/collect than any other Smash game has... till now? Weird that you don't see people like that at Smash competitions though, eh?)
                            Pretty much everyone I know thinks Brawl is the best, it’s more accessible than melee and it was on a great console that everyone had to play with friends.

I get the competitive scene doesn’t like Brawl but for casual players the multiplayer was really good, and the SSE was a thing, so we love it.

When my university hosts tournaments (remember this isn’t a competitive tournament, it’s to let people join in and have fun) it uses Brawl still
                    Brawl is by far my 2nd favourite of the series, so I guess I'm one of the weird never seen anybody's.
                    It's the most sold in the series and I've heard casuals say Brawl is the best bc subspace + really strong roster. 
                    Brawl was my favorite so far because of the single player content which was far superior in comparison to previous and future titles.
                    I literally have seen somebody talk about how great Brawl is in comparison to the other games.
                    I liked brawl... 
                    Brawl is the best.  

                    [deleted]
                        > It was a great step forward.

Casually, yes, Brawl was a brilliant game.  Competitively, it's horrible.  A random 1% chance of tripping every time you dash is stupid.  A character that can literally turn invisible and invincible for infinite amounts of time does not make for a good competitive game.  And if you think I'm exaggerating, [I'm not](https://www.ssbwiki.com/Infinite_Dimensional_Cape).  And that's far from the only competitive problem Brawl has, balance is another.  Brawl Ganondorf is considered the worst fighting game character ever, and Meta Knight is considered the most broken, overpowered Smash character ever.  Needless to say, it's nearly impossible for Ganon to beat MK.

Now casually, none of this matters.  You're just playing to have fun, so the balance issues, while noticeable, are excusable.  And for single player modes, it's definitely the best game due to Subspace Emissary alone. Nobody will argue with you there.

Brawl died because it's a flawed game competitively, and Smash 4 will die because there's no reason to play it over Ultimate.  But Melee lives on because it's still unique, and offers interactions that no other Smash game has been able to or even really tried to replicate.  Even though I much prefer playing Smash 4, I still prefer watching Melee due to  its intricate movement allowing for more competitive depth compared to the newer games.  

And it's not like Melee players haven't tried playing the newer games.  M2K played Brawl and Smash 4 at a high level, even being the best in Brawl at the time.  Mango tried Brawl.  Leffen, Armada, and tons of other Melee players tried Smash 4 when it first came out.  

I hope this helps you understand why good game != good competitive game necessarily.  Mario Party is a good game, but not a good competitive game.
                        The Smash ball point is such a great point, I feel like I only just realized those started in Brawl, and what a great addition too
                            Assist Trophies also debuted in Brawl, which are amazing. 
                        > competitive players don't like change and Brawl represents that Smash is not a static game.

When the changes make the game objectively bad from a competitive standpoint, yeah
                        Ah yes here's the obligatory "Melee players don't change" trite. Nevermind the fact that people take shits on melee every few hours without actually understanding anything about it and its community. Many top Melee players including the infamously "hateful" Leffen have expressed interest in playing Ultimate. 


Also why are people so hellbent on getting melee players to "move on"? Nobody in here is telling people who love Brawl more to move on. When Mario Odyssey came out did that make anyone who plays the older Mario games someone who "doesn't like change"? Brawl was a wonderful game casually, but when you can literally just trip randomly at any time in a run, it's kind of hard to play seriously. Your interests may differ from mine, but can we stop the "Melee players hate anything not Melee because they're hateful showerless assholes" rhetoric?
                At the risk of sounding like a hipster, this annoys me a bit because I’ve been on that SSE from day 1. 
                What's SSE?
                    Subspace Emissary, the story mode from Brawl.
                i mean you had people saying those positive things about SSE from the beginning

everyone thought the cutscenes were cool, and almost nobody liked the gameplay

though i guess the verdict shifted from more generally negative to generally positive, but i think that’s just bc more younger players are talking about it
                Competitive player who liked Brawl here.

But I was a dirty planking Pit main, too hipster to play MK and actually win anything.
                I see people saying that Brawl was underrated and that SSE was great.  


Those things are both wrong, but I see them said more often the farther we get from the game
                    oi SSE was my juice when I was a kid, the boss battles were some of the most fun I've had with the series
                        The boss battles and cutscenes were both nice, but I think people seem to have forgotten all the bits in between that where you have to slog through those dollar store Heartless was actually pretty damn awful.
            A lot of people on r/smashbros praise Brawl for basically everything other than it’s gameplay. It has a great OST, good roster, solid single player content, a lot of extra game modes that weren’t as good in Smash 4. The gameplay still sucks though.
            It's going through them approximately right now
            I'm starting to see more and more people saying Brawl was better than Smash 4.
                I'm amazed that so many people can be so very wrong.
                    They're not, people just conflate different parts of the game.

Brawl had much better single player modes than 4, a better roster that melee. Just about everything about it was great... except the actual gameplay mechanics.

When people say "I really liked Brawl", 9 times out of 10 they're talking about Subspace Emissary, not competitive gameplay mechanics.
        As far as I know most people still don't like brawl nearly as much as 4 or melee.

Brawl they intentionally made it uncompetitive. I think most casual players and smash fans like it, it was fun. But it was shitty Nintendo wanted you to play they way they wanted.

For what ever reason they didn't like it became a competitive fighter, and did things to try and stop it. Also brawl had straight up OP characters. 
        The difference is that Brawl is mostly praised nowadays for its solid and abundant singleplayer content, whereas smash 4 is arguably one of the most lacking in singleplayer in the whole series. I’m not saying that this alone means that Smash 4 won’t be remembered fondly, but that if it is remembered fondly, it’ll be for completely different reasons than Brawl.
        No Brawl is just actually bad.

It had a terrific single player, but the multiplayer was a massive step down from Melee in basically every single way. Also Metaknight was so broken and overpowered that he was banned from tournaments. 
        lol, except Brawl is still looked down upon.
        I still hate the core gameplay of brawl, the slow floaty style wasn't fun. Melee is probably tied with 4 for me. Melee challenges were awesome.
    This definitely works with Pokémon (ignoring certain sequels etc)
Right now Let's Go is the best thing ever, Sun & Moon is overrated, XY is the worst game ever, Black and White are underrated gems and Diamond and Pearl are the best games ever

Five years ago it was completely different.

(For the record, that isn't my opinion, it's the opinions I see most often)
        This is almost perfect, but let’s go has been way more polarising than you give it credit for. And I think there’s a sizeable contingent like me who think it’s, you know, fine.
        The best part of this is that you can already see things beginning to change, with Black & White being considered the best game ever by many and X & Y being underrated gems.

Let's Go is a bit of an outlier though, since it's so different from what's generally expected from one of the main games.
            It feels like BW was hated by so many people for so long, I'm glad it's starting to get more appreciation!
                I've played ORAS, XY, DP and BW all in a couple years and not in order so the cycle is not really something I experienced first hand. Still, I love BW (and hate DP).
                    DP will always be my favourite because it was my very first Pokémon game, and I actually got all the badges and beat the elite 4. XY was nice change in graphics but felt too iterative (not that all the others weren’t). ORAS was kind of the same deal. I actually played BW after all of those, and while the story felt pretty cool, it was hard to go back to those graphics and play style after XY and ORAS.
        Let’s GO! is the best thing ever? Sure it’s been successful and I for one have been enjoying it too. But I’ve seen more hate for those games than I’ve seen praise.
            It really depends where you look. Among existing Pokémon fans it's really unpopular because of cutting out a lot of the depth, but among casual players, Let's Players etc. it's being hailed as a return to form after 20 years of decline.

Back when Brawl was first released it actually got a lot of the same stuff; a lot of casual fans claimed it was a huge improvement over Melee, partly because of the high amount of content, but also because they want Smash to be solely a party game.
                It definitely [depends](https://youtu.be/X2YfNeBxGLg) on where you [look](https://youtu.be/c66IR3qA5-w)
        anybody saying gen 4 are the best games was literally born in like 2002 and you can't prove me wrong
            I'm pretty sure (and I say this as someone who thinks gen 4 is best gen) that whatever game most people currently entering their 20s grew up with is what's going to be considered the best gen. Right now gen 4 seems to be the most popular. A few years ago you'd be crucified if you didn't think gen 3 was the best. And recently I've started to see a lot of "BW/B2W2 are underrated gems" type posts. I'm willing to bet that within the next year or two gen 5 is going to be seen as the best gen.
                it's really more of the natural ebb and flow of the fanbase. when 3-4 came out, they were kinda panned by the community. that being said, the community was gens 1-2-heavy back then. as those people sortied because they became disinterested/disinvested in the series (for whatever reason that may be), the community gradually becomes filled with people who started 3-4. and of course, as those people leave you'll see more 5-6..... and so on.
                Am gen 4 fan, will stay gen 4 fan.
            You can make this same post about Super Mario Sunshine
            2000, try again kiddo
                same difference
            They're the second best, 1996.
            1998 here, old enough to have experienced it and gen 3 around the same time. Still think it's the best ;)
            2003, ahaha!
            I started on Red in the 90s and have played every gen (except Let's Go) and Platinum is still my favorite. Amazing tunes, a dope sprawling region that itself was the size of Kanto and Johto from G/S/C combined, and a fun villain to boot.

&#x200B;

I would be so hyped for the eventual remake if I wasn't thinking that Let's Go changed how that's going to play out.
            Diamond and Pearl were utter trash. Platinum improved alot, but Sinnoh still had some fundamental flaws. 

HGSS is fucking pure unadulterated awesome. 
        People actually say that about XY? What?

I'm a huge Pokemon fan and it seems like the general consensus is that Sun and Moon are awful, but XY were pretty great, just not as good as Black/White.

A lot of "true" Pokemon fans seem to think Black/White were the last "good" Pokemon games, but there's still a lot of love for XY. Sun and Moon are universally panned for pandering and the horrible amount of handholding.
        That's because it is built by the people that were young when those games came out. 10 years later those people are able to voice opinions loudly and they do so.

I remember when Windwaker came out and everyone was hating on it, now all you see is the love for that game. they tend to a lot of the time be people that were <10 when it came out.
    This literally happened with Mario the other day on this very sub.  3D World was criticized when it came out and people wanted an open-ended game again, now Mario Odyssey is apparently shit and 3D World is an underrated masterpiece.  I agree 3D World is a great game, but the need to constantly put down another game in favor the one you like at the moment is just so bizarre.   Granted, it doesn’t happen with Mario fans as bad as it does with Zelda and Pokemon fans, but still.
    Black and white was always underated.
        People have shit on the Unova games for a while, but I’ve always liked them. The 2.5 D graphics and the animated sprites were a huge bonus for me, and while there were a few bad designs (Garbodor, Sawk/Throw, Clink, Amoongus) there’s a lot of good designs too (Zoroark, Chandelure, Haxorus, Reniculus). People get hung up on the negatives, but it also has some pretty good positives. I like Team Plasma and N since they actually had a pretty decent argument for what they were doing. The Aesthetic of the region was something I really loved. Black 2 and White 2 were really cool additions to the region as a sort of sequel, something that not a lot of other Pokémon games have done. There was an abundance of legendaries, but the core trio of Zekrom, Reshiram, and Kyrurem were good designs, and the Black Kyurem/White Kyurem lore was pretty cool too.
            Yeah I felt they poorest their heart and soul to make an as interesting as possible world and lure and then when it didn't sell well (even though pokemon has sold worse and worse each gen) they decided to scrap that idea and go hyper kid friendly and simplistic (whilst making the actual core of the game more complex)
                the series's sales have largely stabilized since the end of Pokemania after Gen 2. there are minute fluctuations in sales that can largely be attributed to timing. BW's lower sales can be attributed to coming so very late in the DS's lifespan.
                Pokémon isn't selling worse each gen. X and Y sold better than Black and White. 
        Really? Talking about how good gen five is seems like it's been the popular opinion to have for quite a while now.
        I hated them, just because of the Pokemon choices. Absolutely a matter of opinion, I'm sure they're well-loved in general.
    I call this the Zelda Cycle. Very soon it will be Skyward Swords turn up on top, BOTW is already hovering around overrated - worst game status. 
        The thing with Skyward Sword is that it's difficult to play without having a Wii (which is a total bitch to use on modern TVs) or a Wii U. (Enough said)

The only option otherwise is to use Dolphin and a Wii Motion Plus remote, which requires a pretty baller PC and a lot of technical jiggery.

This will either harm the game's reputation overall by making it so that people can't go back and re-evaluate it, or it'll give it a mistique, causing a certain degree of rose-tinted glasses. Tough to say. We'll see if it gets ported to Switch, I guess.

            That’s not the only issue with SS. The constant babying by Fi telling you how to solve every puzzle. The repetitive nature of the dumb collect the head time trials. And my two biggest reasons for disliking the game is a lack of towns/villages filled with side quests and NPCs and the lack of a true overworked except the empty sky. 
        Skyward sword was a bad Zelda game and I will never change my opinion. 
    Everyone hated windwaker until they realized it was probably top 4 in the franchise.
        Eh. I think the people that hated Windwaker back when it came out really just hated the animation style and never actually played it. 
    They are in the process of doing that to Fallout 4 currently. It's on the uphill now that 76 is out. 
        Sure it’s happening with 4, but New Vegas never got called bad or anything during the 4 hype train.
    It's true with all games, and even a lot of music, released now. No games can escape it, whether it's fallout 76 or farming simulator.
    It's happening with Fallout 4 right now. It got a lot of hate because it didn't carry over the RPG elements and great dialogue and characters from the previous games and but now that Fallout 76 are showing everyone how crappy the franchise can actually get people are calling Fallout 4 a masterpiece. Personally I always thought it was a masterpiece but it's just kind of stupid to see everyone on the internet suddenly agreeing with me when I've been fighting people on this for 3 years
        I still don’t really care for Fallout 4. Got to the fight with the deathclaw and decided shortly after that the game just wasn’t my cup of tea.
        [deleted]
    > Pokemon franchise

I can't wait for people to finally see Ultra Sun & Ultra Moon for how good they actually are. (No sarcasm)
        As for someone who plays Pokemon competitively I think Gen 7 is by far one of the most fun to play with. Gen 6 had a lot of changes at once and were a total mess. Gen 7 had those changes more stabilized.
        No. USM is worse than SM. It put a new story on the SM story and put no effort into adjusting it. Character arcs made no sense. It was a total mess. SM had problems, but the Story had a visable focus with evolving characters. USM spit on it.
            No Pokemon game has a good story. I know it's a controversial opinion, but truthfully, they don't. They'll have some well written characters for sure (N and Lillie come to mind), but overall the stories are always the exact same with minor differences. Always bland.

When I say USUM are good, and I do mean better than SM, it's purely from a non-story perspective. Gameplay, environments, "boss" battles, etc.
                 The improvements were  minor. A few more minigames here a few harder battles there. And in my opinion SM had a good story. Not an innovative but a solid story with good characters. 
And the drop of quality storywise can't be saved by these few minor changes.
        Are they worth it for people who didn't like Sun/Moon? My biggest gripe is definitely the excessive tutorial time, and the rest of the game I thought was decent, but it never really grabbed me.
            Well, it's basically the same game with, imo, better stuff. The boss fights are a lot better, especially the late game one. I think it has a better story too, although it's almost identical.

Thing is, is a lot of the "tutorials" remain. Now, personally, I don't really think they were tutorials. It was just a lot of cutscenes for the story. Obviously, the story isn't really great, so the cutscenes aren't enjoyable.

Still though, I think it's the best Pokemon game we've had so far.
    > I constantly see this with the Zelda and Pokemon franchise.

I don't. I see people suggesting there is a cycle but the truth begs to differ.
        Yeah, no one hated on Link Between Worlds, and no one is calling Triforce Heroes a hidden gem. There hasn't been a switch of opinion on the most recent Zelda games at all.
            For Zelda, it tends to be the major home console releases that are subject to the cycle. That said, there didn't seem to be a shift in opinion with BotW's release.
                You might see a very small amount of people call TP ot SS their favourite but no way did major opinion shift on them. Just when people disliked them, people were crying "the cycle!"
                There wasn't a shift in opinion when SS released, either.
        It happened once with TWW, and that was it. If anything, the cycle is just "who's the louder part of the fanbase at this moment".
    Happens with Final Fantasy also
    This happens every new doctor... wait wrong franchise
    Also true with the Fallout franchise.

Not defending Fallout 76 though.
    It’s the outrage culture reddit and other sites are obsessed with. People like being angry. You’re seeing it with Red Dead currently, and you’ll see it with every major release more or less unless the studio putting the game out is from one of Reddit’s favourite companies, like CDPR.

Fallout 76 is a good example where we saw the media jumping on board. I’m not saying the game is good, because from all accounts it isn’t, but every ridiculously low score you saw made the front page of gaming. There was sites giving Fallout 76 a 2 that don’t normally even review games, all so that they’d get on the front page and get some free publicity. Reddit has become the place to complain about games and gaming culture instead of celebrate it.
    Fun Fact: Brawl actually has the highest Metacritic score of the entire series. 
    I'm a big Ace Attorney fan and that franchise has it in spades.  Apollo Justice was the franchise's black sheep when Dual Destinies released, and now in the couple years since Spirit of Justice, Apollo Justice is more fondly remembered and Dual Destinies is the supposedly worst one.  If there's an Ace Attorney 7 it will be inevitable that Dual Destinies' stock will go up and Spirit of Justice's popularity will nose-dive.
    No one will ever say smash 4 was the best game ever.
    the Zelda pattern doesn’t really apply to Smash Bros.

no one was singing Brawl’s praises in 2015, that’s for sure

also, the Zelda pattern’s shifted.  like with WW, they complained immediately and called ot the best thing ever a year later.  with SS, everyone loved it when it came out, and hated it a year later
    “Wow the [game] was so underrated”
My only giant gripe with Smash 4 was Wii U's classic mode. 8-player smash isn't fun at all when going single-player.
    I agree. 8 player smash is a fun party mode but it's not great for classic.
    Mine was the name of the game(s). And also the initially confusing menus.
    One of my favorite ways to play Smash 4 was with 1 or 2 actual players and 6 or 7 CPU players all level 1, timed stock. Then we'd try to rack up as many KOs as possible.
    Thought it had the worst 1-P mode of any Smash period. Classic on Wii U sucked for the reason you said, there was no Adventure mode, they replaced break the targets with a crappy alternative, Smash Tour sucked, Orders mode was ok but like super fun, nor did it have race to the finish.
        Wait how can you play race to the finish in 3DS?
    MULTI MAN MELEE
Didn't hate smash 4 at all, but some things were off. 

SMASH TOUR
    I discovered Xenoblade through Smash 4, so was playing through it while playing smash 4.  For anyone that hasn't played Xenoblade 1, there's a pretty massive spoiler regarding a character you see early in the game that comes up in a huge twist later.

Smash Tour spoiled that twist for me with a fucking trophy name.  Those two words were the equivalent of "Snape kills Dumbledore" for me.
        Wtf Snape kills Dumbledore????
        And now Ultimate just straight up spoils it with Shulk’s final smash
    Genuine question, why do people hate Smash Tour so much? It was honestly my favorite mode from Smash 4, I'm disappointed they didn't expand on it in Ultimate 
        You must've had people to play with locally. Smash Tour is the least engaging single player mode in all of Smash. I'd take Smash Run or Subspace over Smash Tour any day of the week.
    Smash Tour is a great part mode. pokeball fighting was the best.
    Smash tour wasnt even that bad. I dint get why it constantly gets hate
People have complained about Smash 4 for a while now. If its gotten more hate recently, its because Ultimate is coming out. 

And I love Smash 4, but looking back, its got a lot of problems that stem from Nintendo half assing it. 

Nintendo tried to appease competitive play without committing to it. For Glory was designed to be way more casual than competitive, despite there already being a casual mode. Rankings were unclear, unseeable to other people, you couldnt get knocked down, and worst of all, there was a lot of evidence that it doesnt actually change who you play. 

Its very easy to be punished for no reason and get sent to the Smash hell servers. 

Custom moves were poorly implemented, either useless or broken, and achieved through rare random drops. Meaning you could play for 100+ hours and not get a single new move for a character. After like 2 patches, Nintendo and the competitive community gave up on what could have added some much needed mixup to gameplay. Additionally you also couldnt use them in online matches (excluding private matches). I can see what they were trying to do, and they sorta done it with Echos, but unlike MKX which gave all of its characters 3 different movesets, Smash 4's alts are just kinda tape on. And poorly at that.

Its made worse when you realize characters like Palutina were designed to show off customs, and as a result they basically were left at the bottom of the tiers. DLC characters dont even have alt moves. 

Miis were also pushed hard with costumes, but again because Nintendo abandoned custom so quickly and didnt allow Mii's to be used online, they remained unbalanced and would not be used for tournaments. 

Nintendo made a competitive doubles mode that doesnt actually use standard competitive doubles rules (team attack on) making it kinda worthless for any sort of practice. 

Online match making in general just wasnt great. 

People could hit the lag switch extra hard and you would suffer for it. And if you quits out on a match, or a host quits out on a match due to lag, you can get punished for it and be barred from playing online for a set time or again, get sent to the Smash Hell servers. 

Corrin, Cloud, and Bayo were so top tier that tournament rankings basically became a lot of those 3. The fact that they were also DLC made people feel like they were sorta pay to win.

A lot of great content like Smash Run was 3ds exclusive. 

Some people also found it pretty slow, with a stronger focus on defensive play, made worse by the fact that some character just didnt have great offensive options. 

No kind of Story or Adventure mode. 

Nintendo was basically a cat in front of an open door, unsure if it wanted to go in or stay out. It didnt have the unmatched size of the casual market so it couldnt just be Brawl and it didnt know if it wanted/could give Smash the standard fighting game treatment and all the work that comes with that. 
    Tbh I actually agree with a LOT of those complaints (emphasis on a lot, not ALL). I love Sm4sh but it is definitely very flawed and have been saying most of these things for years....

...But the thing for me that  still makes Sm4sh great is how fun the actual fight lasts are. Smash 4 has probably my favorite actual gameplay and roster balance in the series. No other Smash since 64 has had so many enjoyable characters that I felt were viable. Not speaking competitively, but personally I felt the Mid to lower tiers in Sm4sh were more fun and salvageable than in Melee or Brawl.

So in retrospect, probably the least well-rounded Smash but it at least still got the “main” part right, imo.
    Exactly this honestly. Brawl was not great competitively but offered a lot to the casual player whereas Smash 4 was better competitively but still lacking and the casual experience was arguably worse than Brawl's. Funnily enough it seems that Ultimate is trying to do both and looks to be succeeding, at least on the competitive front. It remains to be seen whether World of Light, Spirits Board and Classic have enough staying power for people playing on their own.

        While it looks way better than Smash 4, I wouldn’t say they’re succeeding with competitive play. It’s still obvious that Sakarai has no idea why people love Melee so much. It’s not about having a lot of characters.
            According to impressions of a surprising number of Melee players, it seems they're succeeding down that road more than you think.

>It’s still obvious that Sakarai has no idea why people love Melee so much.

No, he knows exactly why people love Melee so much. It's very obvious though that he doesn't want to make that kind of game again.
            He knows why there is a die hard part of the competitive smash community that wants another melee. He’s said before in interviews that he doesn’t like how punishing it can be nor the exploits that came from some interactions.

He wants the series to go in the direction Smash 4 did for overall play with ultimate going further down that road.
    Wow, well said. Thanks for taking the time to comment. 
    Quality comment. Really agree with custom moves
    > Its made worse when you realize characters like Palutina were designed to show off customs, and as a result they basically were left at the bottom of the tiers.

And this is why I'm going to do everything in my power to main Palutena in this game! All shall know her glory!
    For the love of God, Nintendo doesn’t make these games, Bandai Namco does.
    > Corrin, Cloud, and Bayo were so top tier that tournament rankings basically became a lot of those 3. The fact that they were also DLC made people feel like they were sorta pay to win.

Corrin's not top tier and has no where near the number of players as Bayo and Cloud. I remember people on r/smashbros being surprised that she turned out to be "just" high tier. I agree with your other points, but this is just false info.
        Your right about Bayo and Cloud being extremely dominant, but Corrin was still had a fair ammount of presence in the top tiers.  
For me Smash 4 was a game that didn't really have a clear identity or vision, the decision to make it both a Wii U and 3DS game meant they had to take a lot of half-measures, and the whole interconnectivity between the two versions was completely oversold and turned out to not justify the whole concept. The only thing it really accomplished was making the game sell well despite how poorly the Wii U did.

The 3DS version was responsible for making the gameplay slower than it should have been (as admitted by Sakurai in an interview around E3), as well as roster limitations (Ice Climbers, Pokémon Trainer), while the Wii U version went for gimmicks over substance with all of its single player content. It went for a lot of in-between decisions rather than going all the way in any regard because of the nature of the games.

The newcomer point is very much subjective as well, as someone who's mostly into oldschool Nintendo stuff I cared very little for most of the additions, and neither were I a fan of how almost every new moveset practically had to have a gimmick. You need to strike a balance between old and new, simple and complex, creatures and humans, different fighting styles, etc, and it just leaned too far in one way as far as a lot of those things are concerned imo.

It's much better than Brawl, but that game still knew what it was and felt like it fulfilled its vision, while imo introducing the best content any single game has done in the series, so there are still reasons to return to it from time to time. Smash 4 on the other hand is like a starter Pokémon's awkward middle stage evolution, you use it because it's stronger than its pre-evolution, but it's neither cute or cool and you really just want to evolve it asap. I liked the game just fine mind you, but in every way it felt like it was almost there, but not quite, so it was also a frustrating experience in a lot of ways.
    Upvoted for the “starter pokemon’s awkward middle stage evolution” remark
        And subjective newcomers. Let's not forget how great Melee and Brawl's were. 
            What? Sm4sh had some *tight* newcomers. Mega Man, Little Mac, Shulk, Ryu, Cloud, Rosalina. That's good shit
                I'm not saying it doesn't, but Brawl had Sonic and Snake (groundbreaking at the time), and Melee had some of the biggest Nintendo characters added, like Peach and Bowser.
                    To be fair, with each new game, the prospect of crowd-pleasing, jaw-dropping newcomers gets lower and lower because previous games have already included them.
                Little Mac and Cloud are the only two out of those that I enjoy playing as.
    Yeaaah, tbh Smash 4 is the only smash game I’ve ever burned out on. 64? Dang, it’s so fun to go back to sometimes! Melee? This game was my *childhood.* Brawl? Oh my gosh, subspace emissary was the best, I have so many precious memories of the hype preceding brawl, and this game was *always* fun to play for me. But with Smash 4, the more I played it - especially Classic mode, which somehow felt lifeless compared to the previous games despite technically being bigger (I wonder if my dislike of the Master Core fights compared to Master Hand had anything to do with it) - the more I grew to dislike it.
    This. While no smash game has been perfect every other game Melee and Brawl both felt like they added (or tried to add) something to the series. The fact it was even called Smash Bros Wii U instead of something like Melee, Brawl, or Ultimate really sums it up.
    You’re mostly into old school Nintendo stuff but Little MAC and Mega Man didn’t do it for you??
        I cared little for *most* of the additions, I didn't say I didn't like any of them. Those two were by far the best newcomers imo.
            Fair fair. For me I gotta be honest I’m a GameCube kid and Sunshine was my shit so seeing Bowser Jr was really all I needed. Having Mewtwo back was huge. Ultimate is gonna be amazing.
                That Shadow Mario final smash made me so happy
Idk maybe I’m too much of a casual gamer but I’ve really enjoyed every single smash game so far. I always have a lot of fun playing them with my friends. None have been bad to me.
1Just watching footage of ultimate make me realize how defensive and formulaic smash 4 was. And it was too hard to finish stocks. Smash 4 being a 2 stock game is lame. 2 stocks isnt enough for a dynamic match and rage was waaaay OP. Shield was too safe and spamming air dodge was lame. Also bayo just ruined the fun.

It's a great party game but the better I got at 1v1 for glory matches the less I liked how the game played
Viewed holistically smash 4 is probably my least favorite smash game. Brawl might have had a poor engine but had single player content that was fun and introduced many of my personal favorites. Melee had tons of great additions to the series, an exciting battle engine, unique break the targets, and my favorite events mode thus far. Smash 64 I’ll always just have fond memories of because I was like 10 when I got it. 

Smash 4 on the other hand really only felt like I got multiplayer out of it. I enjoyed the roster but there just wasn’t much to do and I wasn’t a huge fan of a lot of the stages introduced. Honestly if smash 4s engine wasn’t such an improvement from brawl I feel like smash 4 would be viewed universally lackluster.

And now seeing what we’re getting in ultimate, smash 4 really just feels like an incomplete stepping stone that satisfied us while we waited for the game we’ve wanted for decades.
    Brawl is automatically the worst Smash game because of tripping.
        From a competitive standpoint yeah, but the single player content is fun.
        Who still gives a fuck about that shit  
It barely happens and it's barely of any consequence
            Objectively its just a bad mechanic that was ment to make the game more balanced. 

It didnt happen as often as some people say it did, but it happens enough to be noticable. It mess up your flow/combo and generally sucks. Ive died because of tripping and Ive seen plenty of people die because of it too. It doesnt feel satisfying to anyone.

When you trip, your opponent isnt getting lucky, your getting unlucky. There no counter mechanic that compensates for it. You cant accidentally have you attack do extra damage. 

All it does is add an unfair element of luck to the game, and in a fighting game thats pretty awful.

 
                It is objectively a bad mechanic and i'm happy with its removal  
But the effect is small enough to barely matter in the grand scheme of things and certainly isn't anywhere near enough to make Brawl the worst Smash game. 
                    Your right, its not the reason. Brawls problems run a lot deeper than just one bad mechanic. 
            1-2% chance to instantly lose your life when you move is something a lot of people give a fuck about when they're tryna win.

Nothing like losing a few hundred $$$ because you tripped
                Competitive Smash is less than 10% of the game's enjoyability. That 10% might suck in Brawl, but you still have a whole bunch of single player modes and multiplayer parties with heavilly very customizable rulesets, etc...  
And besides, if you trip, it's not as if you're 100% guaranteed to lose your life. Even in a competitive match. Fuck, i dare say that less than half of trips immediately result in a lost stock. It's less a stun and more like an interruption
                    competitive smash is less than 1% of the games enjoyability. The competitive scene is extremely small, and the mechanic itself was just a giant fuck you to the competitive community because sakurai didnt like them or something.

You're not guaranteed to lose your life but against good players it happens all the time, simply because once they get you where they want you to be they dont let you go until you're dead
            > barely of any consequence

Hardly. You trip anywhere near another player that's a stock gone.
            Lol no. Happens often and can cost you a stock easily. The most ridiculous idea ever implemented in Smash. 
Classic mode was far from classic. No story/adventure mode. Playing with friends was pretty fun, but it wasn't great for single player.
    [deleted]
        Right? It wasn't necessarily a bad mode, but it sure as hell wasn't classic.
Melee still has the best gameplay, but Smash 4 was a big improvement over Brawl.

Some people were really disappointed Adventure mode was cut, even though the gameplay in Subspace Emissary wasn't great.

Smash 4 is a good game, my number one complaint about it, is that it never got a real title. For Wii U and for 3DS sound like placeholder names.
    I was shocked when I heard that those were the actual real titles.
    [deleted]
        Yeah, people were really disappointed when Smash 4 didn’t have an Adventure mode, but the gameplay in Subspace Emissary wasn’t great.

The cutscenes were cool, but don’t really provide much after you’ve watched them a couple times.
    Yeah, my biggest complaint was the complete lack of compelling single player on the 3DS. It was hard to play with friends because they all needed their own system, and it was hard to play on your own because the single player wasn't great.
It's because there are no npcs or quests.
People who would normally defend it are too excited for Ultimate, letting the people wity issues to finally be able to talk. Whether they're right or wrong is up to you.
Just haters being haters. I loved Smash 4 from the moment I picked it up to the moment I replaced it with Ultimate. Don't let the haters bother you, people always gonna hate on something you like.
It's not recent.  People were complaining about how janky Smash 4 was two years ago.
[deleted]
The Internet hates everything.

I guarantee you'll see just as many comments calling Melee shit, as well as Brawl and 64. I also wager you'll see some comments calling Ultimate shit as well, it's best to not focus on negativity since there's so much of it.
    The internet is shit. 
        The internet is not something you just dump something on.
            It's a series of tubes.
                Green, plumber-sized tubes right?
            Clearly not everyone got that memo. 💩
My only gripe about Smash 4 is how much it was held back by the 3DS Version of the game. Don't get me wrong, I think making a portable Smash game was a brilliant idea and Smash Run is probably my favorite mode in Smash 4, but

1) After seeing World of Light, I'm 100% confident that Sakurai wanted a story/adventure mode in the game and wasn't allowed to because it wouldn't be able to be done on the same scale on the 3DS.

2) We (supposedly)  got the Ice Climbers fully developed in the Wii U version and then cut when the 3DS version proved to not be able to handle them.

And then Sakurai tried to insist that the two games should be treated as separate entries in the series and not ports of one another, despite their development being simultaneous and so closely interwoven that Point 2 is a thing.

Part of me wishes that we could have gotten a Wii U version of Smash that wasn't held back by the 3DS hardware limitations. It's still an amazing game, I just feel it could have been more still.

But that's in the past now, and I'm really looking forward to Ultimatr.
    The single player story was cut because Sakurai didn't like that you could just look up the ending online. He thought it would cheapen the game. 

I'm thinking that he got enough criticism afterwards for his ridiculous remarks that he changed his mind and decided to add a story mode back in to Ultimate.

I feel like I'm seeing more people just being critical of it. Not necessarily saying it was bad, but critiquing it in context of what came before it and what is following it. Its single player mode was a joke, which even if subspace emissary had flaws at least there was a single player mode. And one of smash 4's biggest drawing points was its huge and unique roster, which is now being shamed by bringing back every single fighter in its sequel. 

Smash 4 was great when it came out and it still is, but now that theres more to compare it to it's getting ripped apart by critics on the internet. Give it a few months and honestly I bet people will be bashing ultimate to praise smash 4
I'm a big fan of Smash 4, but it's true that compared to Melee and Brawl it seems to lack the same identity. I don't see myself really ever going back to Smash 4 after Ultimate is released, where Brawl had subspace, and Melee had a faster gameplay style. I don't think anyone really 'hates' it, but I think this is the sentiment that many are feeling these days. Smash Tour was awful, and Smash Run was pretty decent, but hardware limitations limited it's potential. 
Never forget: If it isn't Melee, it isn't Melee.
Probably because Ultimate has made it pretty much irrelevant now. Every Smash game had something unique about it that kept people coming back:

64 was the original and thus nostalgia

Melee had the super glitched physics and competitive scene.

Brawl had SSE and some of the best stages in the series.

3ds had Smash run.

Ultimate takes what Wii U did well and builds upon it while scrapping the bad stuff like Smash tour or the landing lag that affected so many characters. It also features options that the would have made the Wii u version brilliant such as a stage hazard toggle or stage morph. Also, the stage select was slightly messed up, with characters in really weird places (Yoshi in between Bowser and Rosalina, Lucina, Dark Pit and Dr Mario separate from everyone else). 

And finally the DLC. A lot of the DLC were characters that had been cut from other smash games. Sure Mewtwo and Roy might have been slightly justified, but making people buy Lucas separately despite him being in the previous game felt scummy. Not only that but two of the most OP characters were locked behind a paywall. One of them completely ruined the competitive scene: just watch EVO 2018.
    I'm quite a fan of 64 and I'd maintain it's not purely down to nostalgia. I quite like how broken the characters the whole cast is. I'm  not a fan of shielding either and it's very weak in that game.
        People dont give 64 enough credit (probably cause theyre too young ti have played it) but the combo contests and sick 0-to-deaths push it above Brawl and Smash 4.
            Also, Smash 64's sound effects are amazing!
        0 to death Kirby combos feel incredible.
    Melee’s physics aren’t glitched. They were designed that way.
        True, but there were certainly lots of glitches in melee, some that make certain characters unplayable (game and watch
            How is Mr. G&W glitched?
                His shield doesn't even cover himself so he can still be hit.
Well I've never really liked it. At least the Wii U version.

Thing is, it has better gameplay than Brawl, but worse than Melee.

In terms of single player modes it botched classic and then has...well not much of anything really. This is the sequel to the game that had the Subspace Emissary.

It has a good roster. But the roster is only good until the next game. Now it's just obsolete.

At least the 3DS version's classic mode was decent and Smash Run was fun.

If I could have played that with a regular controller I would have prefered it.

I gave Smash 4 a year as my primary Smash when it came out for it to get fun or I would drop it. It didn't, so I did.

Thing is, in that time, PM died while I was away, so I ended up stuck as a Melee player... 
    Same boat here, I've disliked *Wii U* for years because of the horrendous single player (especially compared to *3DS*'s modes.) Crazy Orders was the only interesting mode even if the novelty wore quick, everything else was either watered down from previous games or just a step in the wrong direction.

Going forward I'm sure I'll still boot up Smash Run from time to time, but good riddance to Smash Tour and the Rival mechanic.
    I've heard  everyone talking about subspace emissary lately and I havent played brawl for a few years so I said I'll play it all over again, got halfway through and stopped. It was fine but I didnt love it on release and I feel the same way now
        It was significantly better than anything Smash 4 put forward.

The cutscenes alone were worth it.
            Cut scenes were definitely very good and I didnt have a wii u so I didnt play that version of smash 4 much, I mostly played on 3ds
Recency bias. New game coming out so the old one sucked.
    I haven't really felt that way before about new smash games. When I heard brawl was coming out I was excited, but still had a lot of fun playing melee when I got it. Same thing with smash 4. Brawl, while floaty, is enjoyable.
    Competitive players have been hating on Smash 4 for much longer than the amount of time Ultimate has been in the picture. Can’t speak for casuals though.
I haven't really noticed anything. I thought it was a great game. It was kind of a flash in the pan compared to other Smash games (IMO - that's what it felt like to me) but it was fantastic for what it was. Still picking away at those challenges.
Personally I really enjoyed Smash 4 and I'm not gonna stand here and say it's bad, but it doesn't have the best gameplay imo (melee) or the best newcomers (brawl or melee). And honestly I don't know what extras you're talking about, that was easily the most lacking aspect of the game. 
For me, Smash 4 has only ever been fun when playing with a bunch of friends. It’s great in that way since there are so many characters and stages but outside of playing with people I don’t think it’s a very fun game. I think every other smash game had better single player modes and were more fun the just play against CPUs in smash mode also. 
Best newcomers? 

Brawl had Pokémon trainer, zero suit samus, snake, sonic, pit, Ike, Dedede, meta knight, lucario, Lucas, olimar, and Diddy Kong, plus a few clones. 

Melee had falco, marth, Zelda, sheik, peach, ganondorf (ok so maybe these aren’t that great). 

None of smash 4s newcomers were fun to play as imo. I was always going back to Mario, DK, yoshi, ness, cpt falcon, etc. 
    I loved Cloud in Smash 4 tbh...but you're right that most of them atleast weren't that fun.
I think from the competitive side, it's because of how good Bayonetta was. But from a casual side, it's probably due to Ultimate being everything + more. I prefer 4 > brawl so at least it has that. And without it, a lot of stuff in Ultimate wouldn't be happening
I’d argue brawl had better newcomers, like so many that look like should’ve always been there. And extras is pretty highly debatable there, quantity vs quality think about how often you use equipment vs how fun subspace was, but your right on gameplay
Smash 4 lacked content , and also because ultimate has improved upon smash 4 in every way possible
I really enjoyed Smash 4 and I would never call it a bad game but it is definitely the game that is made most obsolete by it's successor. 

64 still had unique break the targets stages, unique stages and board the platforms, and much different mechanics to Melee to still make it worth playing. Melee had much different mechanics compared to Brawl, break the targets, adventure mode, unique stages and characters cut in Brawl. Brawl has SSE, boss rush, unique stages and characters cut in Smash 4. 

Smash 4 doesn't have much to distinguish itself from Ultimate. The mechanics are similar enough but with a few tweaks. Every character from Smash 4 returned including several newcomers and all past cut characters. Almost every stage has returned, classic mode is better. World of Light is totally new. The only truly unique things that Smash 4 has are Smash Tour which is widely hated, Smash Run, the target bomb game that I can't remember the name of, and Master/Crazy Orders. The only thing I'll miss in Smash 4 is Smash Run and that was a pain to actually play with real people. I don't see any reason to go back to Smash 4 once Ultimate is out.
This is the first instance where a Smash game will just straight replace another one. 64 will always be the classic, Melee will always have the competitive scene, Brawl will always have Subspace and disappointment, 4 will always have...Smash Tour? As far as content goes, 4 didn’t have much to it, and what was there was mediocre at best. Everything 4 did well, Ultimate is doing better, so there’s no real reason to go back to it.
The smash 4 hate isnt recent. It started once bayou happened and sond things with the competitive scene.
As much as Ultimate looks great and has an epic roster, I already see places where Smash 4 has an edge. Not everyone will agree but I loved custom characters, sure they are broken and thus unusable in competitive but most people don't do competitive and its a good option for fun. Stage creator was a hoot too even though it was pretty lackluster and terribly awkward to use, the result still offered more fun like smashket ball... just needed improveming.

Smash 4 always had its downsides with no proper singleplayer on Wii U and Wolf missing... but like every Smash it was special and packed.
Long story short. Bayonetta and unplayable online basically. 
As far as the competitive scene goes pros have always hated Smash 4, more specifically, Bayonetta and Cloud. The game has been on life support since 2016 at the latest. 

Pros are finally coming out and giving their honest opinions [now that they don't need to worry about profiting off the game.](https://twitter.com/Anti/status/1068834369601765376)


Personally I think Smash 4 is the worst in every category. 

Competitively speaking it's worse than 64 and Melee

Single player is worse than Brawl due to the exclusion of a story mode, which by default means Ultimate will be a better single player game than Sm4sh. Even 3DS had Smash Run. 

    Something about Anti hating Smash4 despite being a top level competitor is extremely cathartic. Smash4 was a miserable tournament game for me, even before the awful DLC characters.
I just think that Ultimate just destroys Smash 4 in terms of quality and gameplay, while also feeling like its still Smash 4...if that makes sense.
> Best gameplay

Hmmmmmm. As a smash player I can say the campy defensive playstyle of smash 4 wasn't the best
    Tbh, I honestly thought 64 and Brawl's gameplay was better than Smash 4's.
        Brawl was my first so i'm biased, but Smash 4 got tiresome really fast. It's like it punished you for trying to do cool shit
            I remember bodying someone with Smash 4 Marth, than random Smash 4 dank happens, and I actually lose the match...it happens a lot...Smash 4 is unbelievably random and inconsistent in competitive play.

Melee and 64, I would feel I deserve the lost, but in Smash 4 there was genuinely bullshit going on that actually made me lose the match and feel genuinely cheated.
Because the closer we get to Ultimate it's clear that Smash 4 was half-baked as far as Smash goes. The WiiU/3DS split did not help. It played it safe in almost every respect and will certainly go down as the most forgettable Smash game in the series so far.
melee has the best gameplay out of any smash game by *far*

brawl had the best additional content out of any smash game by *far*

these two opinions are the general consensus (and I don't think it's that much of a stretch or anyone would think they're outlandish or out there)

smash4 had some cool new characters, but the content is nowhere near what Brawl had, so there's one disappointment and the gameplay in smash4 is pretty awful so it doesn't have that to redeem itself like melee does.

this is coming from someone who is fairly knowledgeable about both game's scenes- anyone can have whatever opinion they want about either game from a casual standpoint, but smash4 was riddled with flaws that became more and more evident as the game got older and the competitive meta progressed. people who played the game competitively weren't super vocal about it cause they had nowhere else to go. now smash4 is essentially irrelevant considering it's being replaced with a game that is *incredibly* similar. 

since no one gives two shits about smash4 everyone who played the game competitively has been airing their grievances they've been holding onto for the past 4 years and that's why there is all this vocal hate on twitter and reddit. 
Ultimate is making Smash 4 look poor, from a gameplay perspective. Spirits is also giving the game an identity Smash 4 was lacking, though some would say the omission of a fee single player modes makes the game not ultimate.  I loved the time I spent with smash 4, can't wait for the new one. 
Lots of reviews are people that get pre release copies and they put out good reviews so in the future Nintendo will throw them another bone. 

It’s not until a week or 2 end users find out if it’s really good or not. 
    Very true
Because the single player content is garbage and while the multiplayer is pretty good, we seer on the horizon something far better on both fronts.

Smash 4 is simply just forgettable in the long scheme of things. It's not as charming as 64, not as competitive as Melee, doesn't have as good single player as Brawl does, and seems like it won't even have as good multiplayer as Ultimate does.
The competitive scene has huge sway. Although smash 4 was good, the game wasn't sustainable and after EVO 2018 basically everyone gave up on it.

I am only mentioning that bc everyone covered the other details very well. 
I'm not in the competitive side of smash, but I think they have legitimate complaints, and their criticism will make it more fun for everyone. That being said, I can't look at smash 4 and say if the engine works well.

One thing about this game I do know is that there is no single player content in any capacity that was enticing. What they offered was not fun and so it was reserved as a multiplayer game. Because I had no interest in playing it outside of multiplayer, I didn't have the exposure needed to be able to play on a similar level as my friends. This became a cycle where I ended up hating the game. This has nothing to do with Ultimate, though I will say I was not looking forward to Ultimate because of the bad taste I got from smash 4. Luckily, they enticed me with that adventure mode that I have a reawakened hype that I haven't felt in smash for a long time.

Ultimate is just objectively better in every conceivable fashion that smash 4 looks weak in comparison.

>best gameplay (until Ultimate)

That's the thing. Opinions are subjective a lot of Smash gamers don't consider Sm4sh to have the "best" gameplay in the series. 

Also, maybe people are voicing their displeasure over Sm4sh because it came up in a topic or post? If someone gives their opinion on Sm4sh or asks for peoples' opinions over it, then people will respond with... their opinions. A lot of it happens to be negative is all.
Defensive play was too strong and the powercreep with the later dlc didnt help either.
Not bad, just forgettable. It doesn’t have anything to set it apart.
I didn't really like it that much at all its focus on only VS. matches and little solo content, even if you could play online it got stale fast. (smash tour didn't help)
I mean, I'm gonna say it and get shit for it... But... Because Omni made a video on it.
    https://goo.gl/images/Pz9Scz
Okay, first off, you can'y say best gameplay until ultimate.

I have nothing against Sm4sh, but I hate how people are just presuming that ultimate has the best of everything. You don't know what the gameplay is like unless you've actually played it (which you should state if you're going to make claims like that). Also, the best gameplay is debatable. SSB64 has the best gameplay by far in my books, and I know a lot of people think that it's Melee instead. The only outlier is Brawl, really.

All that said, it's just natural. There's a new game coming out, so people are shitting on the old one and praising the new game like the messiah before it's even been released.
Well Smash 4 didn't have many good game modes...  Besides Smash Run
I didn't know this was a thing. Why are they calling it crappy? Do they give no reasons whatsoever? 

I think the games are better in order of release, so Sm4sh is second best, Ultimate...well it's ultimate lol
I loved the wii version the most because of being able to make custom stages. The custom stage maker in the Wii U was awful. But I still loved the game. I hope they bring it back in Ultimate. 
Saying best gameplay is not at all an objective fact and there are loads of people who will disagree with you on that. In fact, that's probably the biggest reason why people say Smash 4 pales in comparison to other Smash title. 
It just didn’t age really well, especially with the handling of DLC characters imo. I hope Ultimate fixes all the mistakes Smash 4 made. 
melee had the best game play hands down. smash 4 is too floatie
    Agree a million percent. Game felt like moving through sludge 
It’s always been my least favorite of the series, to be honest. I haven’t ever commented on this subreddit, so I can’t say why more people are coming out that they didn’t like it as much, but for me:

-The content pales in comparison to Brawl, and even Melee in certain areas. Subspace, as repetitive as it could be, was a substantial single player offering that 4 came NO where close to. Even Adventure Mode from Melee had more meat than 4. The bonus modes in 4 were lackluster comparatively speaking. Also, no target stages for each individual character...

-The Online was still a laggy mess, and there is no excuse for that after Brawl, and the DLC implementation felt lackluster overall. 

It honestly just felt like a lazy addition to the series to me. It had great new fighters, stages and music, but it came no where close to the level of enjoyment I got(and still get) from Melee and even Brawl. Like everything else on the Wii U though, we’ll consider it a necessary step to get to where we are today...and that is Super Smash Brothers Ultimate, which looks to fix my major problem with 4 and bring back that magical Nintendo joy I loved so much.
Let’s not pretend smash 4 was better than 1 and 2
Agree but it had the second best gameplay beind melee / project m and lacked single player content. 
It was good but it was still slow. A lot of people have wanted the more fast paced, more "strategic" Smash that Melee brought to the table. Brawl came out and really was just all around the worst Smash game yet, and a lot of it flew in the face of what Melee was.

Sm4sh fixed a lot of Brawl's problems, but the gameplay remained slow and tedious. 

Ultimate looks to improve even further on Sm4sh. It's clear Sakurai does not want Smash Bros to go back to the same formula as Melee (he has said as much before), but it does seem like he is trying to meet fans halfway. Ultimate is faster paced and definitely more strategic, and now characters who were previously considered weak or "not viable" have been buffed, while previously OP characters have only been slightly nerfed. The goal of this is to make everyone in the game feel strong and viable, which is definitely something Smash fans have wanted for a very long time now. 

It remains to be seen on how the Smash community will place Ultimate, but I think a lot of people are dying for a true, modern companion Smash game to go along with Melee in terms of the competitive scene. Brawl was a total disaster in that regard, and Sm4sh was a huge let down/missed potential. Ultimate has a real shot at being the Smash fans have wanted, and with all of the gameplay out there now, many people are starting to believe that it is.
I just want to say that ZeRo himself believes Smash 4 is the "worst competitive Smash game" and that he'd gladly play Brawl competitively over Smash 4 anyday.

I thought it was pretty interesting.

Here's the link;

    >Brawl competitively over Smash 4 anyday.

I think it's mostly due to Rage. I remember him saying, he hated it more than tripping because it led to a lot of upsets for him. I personally disagree because Rage is conceptually at least, a calculated mechanic the player can control. Rage's problem in Smash 4 was that it could be janky, which leads to characters that should've had no chance at winning, winning anyway. Ultimate fixes the two main problems with rage, namely toning down knock-back and removing Weight Dependent Knockback.

That, and Bayonetta came along so make of that what you will. 
Smash 4 will be the most forgotten out of all the games.

I still play it and I love it but after Ultimate comes out, I probably won’t ever play Smash 4 again. There’s not much to it. 

Ultimate pretty much builds off of Smash 4 but improves it and does what Smash 4 could’ve been. 
You mean Smash Ultimate bet4?

In all seriousness, I loved 4. Melee still has the best mechanics (I doubt any Smash game will ever top it), but Smash 4 struck the best balance between fanservice and gameplay. It blew Brawl out of the water.

I think Ultimate will render 4 obsolete though. Ultimate is basically 4.5.
My opinion on Smash 4

- Split console hurt the game. 3DS could barely handle the concept of Smash, and characters got cut. Wii U was unpopular, so most of the good features were put on 3DS. 3DS was the more common choice, so people always felt inferior if they did not have a Wii U.

- DLC did not suck. Did we all forget Mewtwo? I know Corrin added to fire emblem fatigue, but we got fan favorites like Cloud, Bayonetta, and Roy as well. Lucas probably did not help being close to Ness, but people need to chill out. Final Fantasy has been a long time coming, and Bayonetta won the fan poll. The only problem is they overpowered several dlc characters, but they were not bad additions to the roster. I cant believe after the big Mewtwo, and Roy fanfare people are complaining.

- The game felt.. like a light Smash. As if it was missing something. 


- Amiibo gave us a chance to finally have real Smash trophies. 
Firstly, melee is still by far the best in terms of gameplay. Secondly the reason people are saying sm4sh is bad. Is because they are comparing it to the latest in greatest which is most similar to sm4sh but improved in almost every aspect (except hit stun)
It's soulless.
I don't have much memory of Smash 4 because that came out after me and my friends graduated from High School, so we weren't close enough to get together and play it.
I wasn't wowed by it, which is why I never ended up owning a WiiU. Smash was the game that could have sold me the console, and I didn't find it sufficiently impressive. I never got the impression it was *bad*, though. Just not good enough to sell a console.
There was no story, there were no unlockable characters. Those my only complaints. I have always enjoyed unlocking a full cast of characters in the smash games and the story modes, while short, were fun! If there is nothing to work for besides being able to beat a mode faster, then the game just doesn’t interest me.

I will never say the game was bad or that people who enjoy it are wrong, I just didn’t like it as much.
Probably because it was on the Wii U, so most of the people talking about it probably never even played it. I personally loved it, was way better than Brawl other than lacking a story mode.
I love smash 4 since it started so many friendships with friends around the world that I would otherwise not have today. Even though I love it the game has one issue and that is, its style, or lack of it. The game overall just feels like smash in HD, that's it. It doesnt have any outstanding or defining features despite being packed with content. At least the 3DS has smash run and is suprising that it is running on the 3DS. Smash Wii U is also being lambasted because Ultimate is coming in 4 days which makes sense. I will always love smash 4 though and it is still fun to play.
It is not really about 4 being bad but ultimate being good

For example I and a friend just played brawl subspace emissary for the first time in many years and it felt slow and clunky compared to 4 
Smash 4 never clicked for me. I loved Melee and Brawl, but I guess not being able to play with my childhood friends just didn't make it as worth as the other ones. 
Smash 4 was OK, but as a non-competitive smash player, I have to play it mainly solo as its hard as an adult to wrangle my buddies with any regularity, it made it less accessible for me, and then adding a bunch of DLC, made it meh.  Without a single player campaign, there's not a lot to do that doesn't get repetitive very quickly.  Its a good game, just not a great experience if you don't have many opportunities to play it with a group of people.  I did enjoy the introduction of Amiibo, but felt they were really under-utilized in Smash.
I definitely don’t hate Smash 4.  It’s basically been THE go to 3DS game for me since it came out just for being portable Smash.  Thing is, it’s about to be massively outclassed in that respect.
All Smash games are great. There's not one of them that is bad. They have consistently been the best fighting games around. 
Never played Smash 4, but I thought it looked like a big improvement from Brawl. Maybe it's related to the hype for Smash Bros Ultimate?
SMASH 64 OR GTFO
I know I'm probably SUPER late to the comments here

but plain and simple the reasons I felt Smash 4 was just lazy and not at all fun were: 

No real single player or story mode.

You unlocked all the players by simply playing online, those no fun or excitement in collecting all the characters or getting a real surprise. 

One of the best things about the old smashes in playing through the story modes or on vs and randomly getting a super unexpected " A NEW FOE HAS APPEARED" it would get your blood to pump. 
It was fun to try to do everything to try to figure out how to unlock your next character. 

Just simply playing online a few match then coming back and unlocking a new player just sucked out any fun of it. 
**Sm4sh** on Wii U is an amazing game by all accounts. My only issue with it has always been that Ice Climbers were held back by the 3DS version when in reallity they shouldn't have (IMO). So happy they're back for **Sma5h** on Switch.
This happens with every Smash game since Brawl. When Smash 4 came out, everyone denounced Brawl for being the worst in the series due to stuff like Meta Knight and tripping. That seems to be the case with Smash 4 as well. It kinda happens with other series like Pokemon and Zelda too. I remember people hated Wind Waker but thought Twilight Princess was the best. When Skyward came out, people started to hate Twilight. Same when Breath of the Wild came out.
I played it on a N3DS, so that may be why I was whelmed.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't amazing.  The online was an abomination, at least for me.  I know it would have been a better experience on the WiiU (didn't have one at the time), and I'm sure that Ultimate will be really good on the Switch, but when I think of Smash, I still think of the only one I ever played, and it definitely takes away from any hype I would have to get Ultimate when it first comes out.  I might get it after the new year. 
It wasn't good for a single player type of player like me. 
i mean i just know that smash 4 had no single player and that means i’ll never go back because there will be no reason to
It happens every time any fighter gets a new release. no big deal ;) in a month it'll be gone
A lot of the hate was from competitive smash players
People just like to shit on smash 4 cause it isn’t as good as ultimate. The biggest example is this youtuber Omni. He built his whole channel around smash 4 but when they started showing ultimate he now consistently says that smash 4 is a bad game and easily the worst smash bros and even ranks its competitiveness as bad as brawls. Pure bias against smash 4 for literally no reason.
Smash 4 was probably my least favorite after 64. Just didn't have a lot to do in it. It lacked the competitiveness of Melee, and the singleplayer/game mode elements of Brawl. It was stuck in a middle area where it failed to really grab my attention. It's not a bad game, and I still played it a ton, but looking back it really seems like it could have used some polishing and some added features. 
People are now starting to criticize it more probably due to the fact that Ultimate remedies the flaws of 4. Its has faster paced and more complex gameplay for competitive players, and single player content for casual fans which creates a game that can be enjoyed by everyone.
I don't hate it. I just found it really disappointing. I've been playing the series since the day Smash 64 came out, the series helped define my interest in Nintendo and gaming in general, and Smash 4 was the first game to make me question whether I really cared about the series anymore.

None of the new characters really excited me. I was psyched for Mega Man, but I hated how he played. I tried to force myself to play Pac-Man and Villager, but didn't have any fun. So I just wound up going back to DK for the most part.

There was very little single player content, and what remained was mostly garbage. Like what the hell was the Wii U Classic Mode?

Items and stages reached a level of unfun bullshit never before seen, so you could really only play purely competitive on boring stages or have the game turn into a chaotic clusterfuck, nothing in between. I enjoy some nonsense once in a while, like Pokeballs only on Very High on Pokefloats, but items like the Gust Bellows and stage hazards like the Yellow Devil were too much.

People only ever wanted to play 8 player Smash whenever it was being played at a gathering. And I understand why, more people get to play. But there's so much happening on screen that I find it straight up unplayable, so I never had any fun, and eventually just stopped playing. Granted, this isn't a problem with the game, just part of my experience that soured the game for me.

And the core gameplay just... I don't know, it felt like it lacked something. I didn't find it satisfying to play, and I didn't even find it satisfying to watch competitive play. Every time I tried watching a tournament, my eyes would just glaze over.

It felt like the Mario Kart Wii of Smash. Technically competent for the most part, but kinda bland. Even down to the subtitles. "For 3DS" and "For Wii U" were just... the disappointment I felt when they confirmed that those were *actually the titles* and they weren't gonna get something cool like BRAWL and MELEE was kind of a microcosm of my feelings on the game as a whole.

I didn't play the 3DS version enough to unlock all the stages, and I didn't even play the Wii U version enough to unlock all the characters. And then when they revealed that one of the final DLC characters would be Corrin, a character that literally nobody asked for from a series that already had twice as many characters as it deserved - every single one of them among the blandest characters in the entire game, might I add - I just kinda spitefully never even touched the game again.
Nah, Melee has the best gameplay, and smash 4 only had the best 3rd party newcomers. Brawl had the best first party newcomers and was the first one to even introduce 3rd party representatives. And smash 4 barely had any fun content besides the normal battles. Classic was messed up, the contest modes were whack, and there wasn’t even good single player content besides event matches.
Smash 4 was solid.  In terms of fun had when playing with others, they’re all equal for me except for Brawl. But that’s because I didn’t really play Brawl with anyone else because no one I knew played Wii outside of Wii Sports and Mario Kart. 
I don't think it's new, it's just that people bring it up as a new game approaches.  

  

We all complained about Classic Mode, broken characters, inexpressive faces and Smash Tour when the game came out, believe me.  

  

At least we on Smashboards did.
Smash 4 wasn't a bad game at all. But compared to Ultimate, it looks and feels like an unpolished prototype. Ultimate refines Smash 4's engine so much to the point where Smash 4 may as well never have happened. I think another reason is that people are just kind of tired of Smash 4 and want something new. When you have a game that stopped getting updates in 2016, leading to a stagnating meta and Bayo witching hour, combined with being on a dead and unpopular console, it's no surprise people want to move on to something more fresh.
It’s 2018. Everyone is hating on everything that was preciously loved now. For gaming it’s Bethesda, Ubisoft, blizzard BioWare and bungie. People have turned on Elon musk Google amazon and Matt Damon. I’m just glad Mr Rodgers isn’t around anymore because I’ll fight anyone who hates on him. 
It wasn't bad, just incomplete and the balance was a little off.
To me, now that ultimate is out there is nothing that really makes smash 4 stand out.

64- Basically known for being the first smash. Started it all.

Melee- Seen by most to have the best gameplay of all smash games. Has kept it's presence of being still played in tournaments.

Brawl- First to introduce 3rd party fighters. First to have a proper story and cutscenes.

Ultimate - Every character ever. much more songs and stages than ever before. Most options within multiplayer.

But for smash 4, while very good, I can't really think of anything that makes it stand out.
I was personally not huge on smash 4. While I will agree that it had some of the best newcomers, way better than Ultimate’s imo, I felt it lacked so much in the way of actual single player content. It felt like aside from just smash battles there was really not much to do. If I ever wanted to play smash with friends, it’s the version I’d always go to, but it was still the version I spent the least amount of time with. 
Casually it’s a was fine game, but it was a competitive dumpster fire.  The online play was just not functional as a competitive mode, and at high level play the game was poorly balanced.

It’s not easy to openly trash a game you are being /hope to be paid to play, so only now that it’s irrelevant will high level players voice their long held opinions.
I don't get it either, I love Smash 4.
Only on Nintendo forums do you find confusion any time someone doesn't universally love a product

    Brawl is really slow tbh.
Best gameplay? On what planet am I?
Best newcomers....?

Palutena, Greninja, Rosalina, Bowser Jr, Dark Pit, Duck and Wii Fit, Shulk, Little Mac, etc
Idk many of those characters don’t have the most fun movesets. I always thought melee and brawl had better newcomers
People have opinions, sometimes they're different than yours. Sometimes they're even bad opinions. It's kind of a thing here on reddit.
There's a lot of decent points here, but a big genuine one is that Smash 4 is the first sequel in the franchise that feels like a step back in content for the single player experience.

Even if you consider subspace bad, it was still huge and ambitious and offered alot for even a single play through. Smash 4 offered nothing for that and made it substantially less value for dollar if you want content that is not strictly for multi-player battling. 
With Ultimate on the horizon, Smash 4 is going to become the most forgettable Smash game by far. Every game has something memorable about it. 64 was the first, Melee’s competitive scene was(is) insane, Brawl had Subspace Emissary, and Ultimate is... well, the Ultimate Smash game with every single fighter ever. Smash 4 doesn’t really have anything that memorable about it. It doesn’t even have a name to distinguish it from others, like Melee, Brawl or Ultimate.
    This is very true...honestly Smash 4 felt like a NSMB Smash to me.

Brawl and Melee are my favorites, but Ultimate looks great.
Real question: why do you care?
Tbf, I called it crappy a few month after it's release, I don't like how it is played competitive, smash tour is... you know, classic is not classic, customs are dead and boring and it has the worst items and pkmn so far. Weavile and Bonsly are gone, manaphy is way to rare (and gone in ultimate), keldeo is just a pain and genesect is as fun as brawl meta knight. it's just my personal preferance.
Smash 4 doesn't have the smash Bros magic. No story mode, nothing defining it (hd and online I guess). Every other smash game has brought something new and amazing to the table except this one. It is a good fighting game, but not a good smash game.
Anecdotal, but I played the shit out of 64, melee, and brawl. Mash 4 barely held my attention. There was a bad single player mode, multiplayer was sloppy, and they were forced to make changes because they used the same basic game for both the WiiU and 3DS versions. It’s not terrible, but compared to the others, it’s a bad smash game. 
Melee is sick
Imma be honest, Smash 4 did not have the best newcomers. Brawl is kind of uncomparable..
I don't think it's recent at all. It might be that smash community talk is more visible now due to Ultimate being so close, but since about half a year since the game came out, the general opinion of it was sort of deteriorating. 

It felt like it had about as much singleplayer content as Melee, which pretty much just left the multiplayer to save it. While the game exceeds from a casual standpoint, it's a bit lackluster once you start getting into the meat of it. It was certainly an improvement in almost every aspect from Brawl's multiplayer, it felt like it made too many compromises.

The game ends up being incredibly defensive, which for a lot of people, just isn't very fun. Custom moves and Mii fighters quickly became irrelevant due to Nintendo not knowing what to do with them, along with custom moves requiring potentially hundreds of hours grinding the singleplayer modes to unlock.

Then there's the issue of most of the top/high tier characters being DLC, meaning that if you didn't fork over some cash to buy Bayonetta, Cloud, or Corrin, you were potentially at a disadvantage.

While there's still a great number of people who play Sm4sh, a lot of people drifted back to Melee and Project M due to the gameplay not being what they're looking for. It wasn't because people just hated whatever new thing there was (not including hipsters), it's just that people didn't have nearly as much fun playing it.

Hopefully, Ultimate's gameplay can keep some people playing longer than 4 did, or at least have memorable singleplayer content (which it's looking like it will).
Probably because it was for the Wii U.
Melee exists. 
tl;dr: Don't get me wrong, I love this game but there are issues that are somewhat unique to this entry. The unlockables are boring to unlock (the few that there are), little to no single player experience/ adventure mode, many of the newcomers were meh, new issues that previous entries hadn't had to deal with as much (ie- leaks). This was also a time where the community had become increasingly toxic to one another, creating a divide between the smash 4 players and the melee players. The community just seemed so entitled this go around. There is just not much to do without friends.

&#x200B;

For me, I've become sick of playing the game. Sure, I'll play if a friend asks, but besides that, there isn't much to do. I see no reason to go back to the game.

Maybe it's because I grew up with the two games (despite having smash 4 since it came out on 3ds), but I can go back to melee and brawl and enjoy myself for days. Melee will never get old for me to play, as I spent many hours 100% it back then.  I sunk so many hours into brawl (shitty online, single player modes). Stage builder in that game was a magical thing to me and I easily created hundreds of stages. I remember I fought a fox for an hour just because I wanted to. It was great

Yet, in smash 4, I don't feel that. I've played the game for 4 years, almost everyday, and while it was great, it was always with people (unless a new character released or I was in training mode). I never played smash run with them, the monopoly thing in the wii U version was played MAYBE one time for an achievement (I think wii u had them?). I just remembered brawl's achievement mode. Everytime that screen showed up the euphoria followed through me. That's another thing, where are the unlockables in smash 4? Four or five unlockable characters, a few stages, and \*cough\* customs, but none of it was fun to collect. Random drops and a chance of getting dups if incredibley frustrating. What is this, Monster Hunter? Sure, it eliminates the time it would have taken to get those 50 characters and all of those stages, but again, everytime a new stage popped up or a character was "approaching", I. WAS. PUMPED. You know how many times I ran through adventure mod because Dr. Mario beat my ass back in Melee? I have no idea, but it was still fun going through it. In smash 4 Doc shows after like an hour and is easily unlocked. 

So, when people are starting to hate on smash 4 as of recent, I think it is because it's not a fun single player. I know, this is a fighting game and it relies on fighting others, but what did people do when wireless connect wasn't an option/ online fights weren't even a reality? We played the single player modes, we grinded for final destination, WE SPENT 20 HOURS OR 700 VS MATCHES TO GET MEWTWO. THAT SHIT WAS SO COOOOOL. ᵉᵛᵉⁿ ᵗʰᵒᵘᵍʰ ʰᵉ ᵏᶦⁿᵈ ᵒᶠ ˢᵘᶜᵏᵉᵈ. In smash 4 you payed for mewtwo if you didn't buy both games. Don't get me started on Subspace. This "World of Light" mode seems like what people have been waiting for since Brawl. It's cool finding secret characters after beating the game, their cutscenes are engrained into my head to day. The only thing I can vividly remember from smash 4 was when ZeRo went on his massive winstreak and seeing it ended by Nairo at MLG. 

Just a final thing regarding the best newcomers, ignoring DLC because of course they are amazing additions (ie Cloud is a legendary moment in gaming history), and this maybe my nostalgia showing, but finding out Sonic and Snake were in my NINTENDO game back in 2008 was probably the coolest shit of my life. Maybe it's because Brawl introduced me to so many new series that I am saying this, but by the time Smash 4 came around, the new comers seemed weak to me. Sure, we Mega Man, Pac-Man, and many others, but I honestly think leaving it mostly up to our imagination as to actually got in would have been amazing. We knew the roster, trailers and leaks alike. Nothing has disappointed me more than the Lucas, Ryu, and Roy dlc being leaked hours before. That was just something that was never a possibility for brawl and melee, and the community has wised up to it (as well as others trying hard to spoil), but it's not something that should have ever been an issue. With Ultimate coming soon, even though the full roster is known, we have to work for these characters. All 66 of them. Maybe I'll bite my tongue when it takes me hours to unlock Isabelle cause I have to unlock Villager and beat classic mode on said difficulty within 17 seconds or something, but I don't really see that being an issue.
Although not a popular opinion, I think each Smash game is better than the last and that it improves with each entry. I would assume "Ultimate" to be no different.
I mean it may have been the best at the time, but looking back...   

1.	Nintendo split game modes and stages between versions so that people would be incentivized to buy both
2.	Classic mode was uninteresting aside from the final boss
3.	Cut characters returning as paid DLC
4.	Very underwhelming single-player modes
5.	It took so long to unlock custom moves and most weren’t worth it

Overall the game wasn’t bad but it’s mostly forgettable once Ultimate comes out (as opposed to 64, Melee, and Brawl which all have their niche appeals). I guess it’ll be good if you ever want to just play on your 3DS as opposed to Switch?
Sm4sh had the worst single player in the franchise imo, easily the weakest part about the game. It's also just neutral the game, not that fun to play competitively, with few characters (like, 2 that comes to mind) that have 0 to deaths that kills at the top. Most of the cast felt too slow and laggy, recovery was way too good, took forever to take stocks because of low KB on moves. The hype trailers to it's reveal and the cast itself are the only notable parts about it really.
It’s Reddit.
I agree with others that it’s my least favorite of the series. It just felt like a lot was missing from it and I was left feeling pretty unsatisfied after getting it and playing it. That’s the only Smash game I ended up getting rid of after a couple months of owning it. 
Those people are morons. Smash 4 is a fantastic game. 
I never like smash 4 since it came out, it felt empty and soul-less, full of dlc and fewer game modes
Never played it but have been watching a lot of it while I wait for Smash Ultimate. The fact that Cloud and Bayo (both DLC characters) were so god damn strong is kind of off putting. 
When has the internet ever make sense to the fan base?

I never had a will u, smash 4 is the only one I've never played.
I don't have a problem with it, but it also was lightest on compelling solo modes. No Subspace mode as a follow-up to Brawl was a huge letdown to me
Smash 4 was great but with ultimate in 4 days I looked back and some parts (Rage, Wii U stages) but it was amazing
Smash 4 didn't have a story mode like brawl did, that's the only real problem I had with it. 
I'd agree with the best gameplay up intuo now, but nearly none of the extras were worth it as well as I'm having the worst batch of new characters.

I agree it had amazing newcomers. But the organization for the menu selection was terrible. The Classic mode was not at all the ‘classic’ mode we’re familiar (and was terrible). There was no adventure mode, which Melee and Brawl both had. The party board mode was also terrible.
There will be no reason to ever go back to it after Ultimate comes out. Ultimate has 4's entire roster, but with faster gameplay, a non-broken Bayo, more stages, etc.
Bc it was hyped to death before arrival by so called gaming-news-outlets.  
Also: the FO76 shitstorm has calmed down.
Hating smash for lack of single player content is confusing to me. I couldn't care less about the single player content I didn't know so many people did.

What?
I feel like it's a similar situation to D/P/Pt where Platinum is just better and makes D/P look like beta versions
Im blaming the lack of Waluigi! WAHHHHHHH
I just thought Smash 4 was really boring when it came out for Wii U. The campaign mode felt really empty and lackluster(when compared to Brawl's which I loved), the online bored me and I didn't have friends to come over and play it with me so I ended up selling it shortly after getting it. I am getting Smash Ultimare for Christmas and I'm hoping World of Light is more enjoyable than whatever Smash 4 had.
Personally it did bring me and my friends lots of fun the past few years, but it lacks charm and personality. Melee and Brawl had their own charm which made them feel special in their own way. Smash 4 is good and all, but it lacks that sense of identity that the other games had, which is my main problem with it.
Smash Tour was lackluster but overall I enjoyed Smash 4 (both the 3DS and Wii U versions).

Sad to see it go once Ultimate comes out though.
I loved Sm4sh’s mechanics, characters, and gameplay, but its single player content was lacking compared to Brawl imo. Ultimate seems like it has the strengths of 4 while improving on them and it has made the single player content more appealing with World of Light and Spirits. 

I still like 4, but Ultimate definitely seems like it’s improving on 4 in every way possible. 
In my opinion Smash 4 fixed a lot of the problems that brawl introduced. I’m hoping that Ultimate doesn’t overreach and suck like Brawl did. 
Mario kart for Wii U was similar in that it fixed a lot of the problems of Mario Kart Wii had. Best we can hope is that Nintendo continues to learn from the past. But given the grandiose scope of Ultimate, they are bound to get some things wrong 
I've never been into Smash competitively, but I know of a few people that have been. In those circles, I believe it's sometimes referred to as "Tr4sh". Most super competitive/cliquey groups seem to put Melee on a pedestal as the gold standard. Anyways, my point is that some circles have hated it for quite a while.
For casual playing smash 4 is by far the best, I played it with my daughter since she was 5, she actually mains Bayonetta lol.

I played online all the time too and for Glory helped get better, it's a matter of preference, it's not as competitive as melee but definitely more inclusive to new players.

Is SSB4 flawed? Yes.

Do I have over 400 hours in it? Also yes. I fucking love Smash 4.
Guess they’ve never played Brawl!
    Brawl's actually my second favorite.
I don’t get it either. It’s like people don’t remember how much we loved Smash 4 in 2014 and 2015. 

Yes, in comparison to Ultimate, it’ll be inferior. But that doesn’t make Smash 4 “crappy”. It just means Ultimate will be an improvement. Which happens with almost every sequel.
there were always people who hated Smash 4, they just didn’t complain about it over the past 2 years because there was no reason to talk about a game they don’t play/stopped playing

now you got a lot more people talking about Smash in general, so the people who hated it have been pulled back into the conversation.
Smash 4 has always been inferior in both competitive when compared to melee and fanservice when compared to brawl. 

Watch how the competitive scene will very quickly abandon smash 4 and go to Ultimate. This is also what happened with the Brawl scene to Smash 4.

I love how Ultimate is putting effort into the fanservice-- i love smash bros cutscenes like the ones Brawl introduced. I'm not expecting any mechanical masterpiece like Melee though
Forever my favourite smash. With trophies!
Smash 4 was the first Smash game I liked, and I still love it so... I have no clue why it gets THAT much hate. I understand that Ultimate WILL be the best Smash game to date (and I am very excited to play it), but it's pretty uncool people are dragging down this game because of Ultimate imo.
Gameplay wise melee is better but it's just smash 4 is just that smash game that's gonna die cuz ultimate it doesn't have that charm melee has even tho I'm sure melee is dying
Smash that hate button 
Smash 4 WAS good, and it did a lot right. But it wasn't like it didn't anything groundbreaking, it was just the best we had. Now Ultimate is the best we have, and smash 4 has literally nothing on ultimate. It just looks bad in comparison. 
Although smash 4 wasn’t perfect, I played the absolute shit out of it with all my friends and family. I’m going to miss it dearly but it’s time for it to die. We’re going to have a proper ceremony for it’s passing RIP
Smash 4 Wii U was overshadowed by how much better Smash 4 3DS was, plus Smash Run was cool enough to almost be its own game. 
Because it had a lot of problems, starting with the ancillary content.
all this hate ( for good and bad reasons ) and i'm here wondering how many of these complainers played Project M?. I like all smashes because they are each different!! my one issue has always been some characters getting hit priority over others. two smashes should cancel each other out IMO, but i know its very difficult to have that implemented/balanced but come on...lil mac's punch shouldnt go thru my sword swing kinda stuff lol. any thoughts?
Nerfed Meta Knight
We're so starved that we're resorting to cannabalism 
Every game ever has a very vocal minority hating on it. If I listened to it I’d never play an video game ever again cause apparently the all suck.
Some people say melee best so people thinl thats true
Honestly internet has kind of over hyped me on ultimate a bit too much.
I always hated it because it’s slow and linear as hell. Even my casual friends and family couldn’t get into it.
I agree with the gameplay part but I don't know if I would call it the best newcomers. Brawl had Pokemon Trainer, Meta Knight, Dedede, Lucas, Wario..... and Smash 4 had Wii Fit and Dark Pit. Not saying Brawl is flawless or Smash 4 is trash, I just didn't really like the newcomers in Smash 4. I really was only exited for Villager and Pac-Man.
Nah. It was ok...like just ok.
People are snobs 
people were saying the exact same thing about Brawl when 4 came out, and the same about the original Smash when Melee came out.
/r/kappa leaking
Welcome to 2018 and the internet. Is it popular? Then I obviously have to hate it
New good, old bad, older best. It's the Video Game Fan Opinion Cycle. Just wait till you see what people will say about Breath of the Wild once the next Zelda comes out...
Same as Brawl hate after Smash 4. It's the circle of life.
>best gameplay

Yikes
Smash 4 is a great game.  It just doesn't have anything to make it stand out compared to other Smash games.

64 - the first one

Melee - fast and frantic gameplay.  Nostalgia

Brawl - Subspace Emissary

4 -?  Smash Run?  Smash Tour?
That wasn't an uncommon sentiment at launch, either. It's just rearing its head again because of the upcoming release of Ultimate. I liked it, but then I'm not deep enough into smash and its nuances to understand many of the complaints.
It was crappy, Having 2 stock matches take twice as long as 4 stock matches shows this.

Recovery in 4 is too damn strong, Too hard to kill confirm, Fast characters were nightmarish unbalanced. They removed spiking of all things.

They catered to the lowest common denominator and it showed.
I dotn think 4 was bad but it lacked a lot in comparison to Brawl and removing characters because "the 3ds can't run them" sucks. As well as no subspace emisary

We 
    live
A lot of players in the Melee community never liked it to begin with. 
Came here to say this. Ultimate is quite literally what the developers felt they got wrong in Smash 4, with a couple new or returning mechanics like directional air dodge and parrying. By comparison, this just makes Smash 4 look incomplete and dumb to alot of people. 

I love Smash 4 regardless, but I can definitely see where people are coming from. Is it unwarrented? Mostly. Is it out of the blue? Not really.

Shiny new toy > Old broken toy
    But that shouldn't make it 'shit' or 'garbage'.  Do people consider the OG Smash for N64 shit?  Because every entry in the series has improved upon it considerably.  Compared to even it's direct sequel (Melee) it's basic af.  But that doesn't make it a bad game, just an earlier entry in the series.  Sequels improving upon their predecessors is supposed to be the natural progression of video games.
        This is the internet. Everything is the best or worst of all time. Everything is either 5 stars or 1 star. Nuance is dead. Hyperbole is king. 
            This comment is the best or worst of all time.





Just joking around, I agree for the most part. The internet favours the extremes and the limit cases.
            Only a Sith deals in absolutes.
                But... that's an absolute.
                    Thats intended
        Well Smash is weird because many, many people will say that Melee is and will always be the best and that all are other smash games are downgrades.

&#x200B;
            Well, for a competitive player of top level, this is always going to be true. All around as a game is a completely different story.
                But what if I scream "nostalgia" at you?
        Ya, it’s something that people seem to forget rather quickly. Granted, the staleness of Smash 4 never quite reached Brawl’s level, but towards the end here it’s definitely been noteworthy.
        It's far from being "garbage", but it seems to me like Smash 4 is receiving more hate than usual because, unlike the first three Smash games, it doesn't offer much that would make someone come back to it after its successor comes out. 64 is the starting point of the series and still feels unlike any other Smash game, Melee's technical gameplay and tournament scene will keep it going for years to come, and Brawl has Subspace. Smash 4 doesn't really seem to offer anything right now that Ultimate or another Smash game doesn't have; the only things really unique to it are Smash Tour, its take on Classic Mode and Target Blast, none of which were very well-received, and Smash Run on 3DS, which is a game that's been largely ignored anyway since the release of the Wii U version. Ultimate is the closest thing to a straight upgrade over its predecessor on all fronts we've seen from a Smash game so far, and Smash 4's reputation will suffer for it. Maybe someday people will come back around to it, but I don't really think it's going to get the same level of pseudo-revival that Brawl has gotten in the last few years.
    It's  still stupid to complain, it's only a good job if the new iteration is better than the past
    I get it, but to a casual smash player, Smash 4 is a very solid game. Great roster. Good stages. My second biggest gripe is that I can't turn off stage bosses. My biggest gripe is that Lucario is broken as sit and if you can keep him on stage past 130%, you almost one shot a 20% person and that's broken as shit.
And once Ultimate problems become clear, people will be talking about how much they miss Sm4sh. 

It happend with Street Fighter IV and MK9.
    You don't know Smash.  They'll be talking about how much they miss Melee.
        This. It always comes back to melee
            64 smash or nothin
                I prefer smash on the Atari 2600, thank you very much.

The Atari was the best Nintendo
            and there’s a reason for that
        I think these are two different demographics. Most Melee fans never cared so much about Sm4sh, and they won't care about Ultimate either.
            [deleted]
                But will they play it competitively? I am not sure. Melee is so unique...
                It's not a stretch that the 10% who said 'no' make up the majority of the hardcore players who shit on all other Smash games.  'Silent majority' is a thing after all.
            Agreed, the people who always come back to Melee are hardcore Melee fans. A lot of casual fans (like myself, although I consider myself a “hardcore” fan of Smash, just not competitive ) still love Melee but, at least for me, I don’t always come back to Melee.
            Huge Melee Fan, super stoked for Ultimate.
            None of the other games have attempted to recreate what drew the melee players to the game in the first place. Melee was extremely fast paced and had a high skill floor and ceiling, which is great for serious gamers but made the game inaccessible to a large part of the target demographic. Nintendo has since dumbed the game down quite a bit, which is great for accessing that market but loses the small minority of very competitive players in the process.
            Ehhh, I was a huge Melee fan, hated Brawl but Sm4sh was easily my favorite smash game mehanics wise at least
    What is MK9?
        Mortal Kombat 9
            Ah ok thanks, already feared I missed a new Mario Kart
            Michael Kors 9
    Honestly as long as we don’t have another Bayo situation then it’ll take a lot to get anyone who cares about the game competitively to miss Smash 4.
        Bayo was easy compared to Brawl MK, and people still say they miss Brawl, lol.

And I think we should expect at least 2014 Diddy situation.
            It’s not necessarily a matter of who was more oppressive, because the obvious answer is MK. Bayo was just so boring to watch and basically destroyed Smash 4’s competitive scene because no one wanted to watch Bayo all the time.

I’m positive we’ll have a broken ass character at launch but that’s what patches are for. Smash 4 was really close to being pretty well balanced but unfortunately was topped by Bayo.
                I agree with everything you said, but I don't think I made my point clear.

The problem is about perception. As the time goes on, people will give less weight to Sm4sh's flaws and more weight to Ultimate's.
                Some of these 0deaths in ult do scare me. It depends on how much of the cast they work on and whether it's possible to (S)DI out of them, but I'm not looking forward to stuff like luigi just fishing for a grab at 0% to do dthrow dair dair dthrow dair dair upB. That's just as bad as smash 4 bayo combos. If a lot of characters have 0deaths like that, I swear snake/links/pichu will literally be counter meta because they can put themselves at %s those combos don't work at.
                    The difference is that while those 0deaths in Ult are scary, they're not autocombos. Like, different SDI patterns and techs in the right direction can get you off the trail, and the aggressor does need to be ready to improvise to keep it up.

What makes it different is the fact that it's not an autocombo. That was Bayo's and Brawl IC's and Melee IC's problems--once most characters got caught in witch twist or infinite chain grab or wobbling, you might as well put your controller down because you're hardly getting out of that one.
                        Well, that puts me at ease then.
                            Yeah honestly seeing all these zero to deaths and such is getting me mad excited because I'm seeing so many options that look both challenging and rewarding to pull off. The engine for this game looks so damn clean.
                                It does look hype, I'm just hoping there will be some real depth to the combos. I was absolutely done with smash4 because, no matter what character you picked, mario players were *always* going to fish for a grab because dthrow uptilts is true until 40-60%. Luigi was always going to do some 0-60 shit. Bayo was always going to get the same 0-death shit.

0-deaths aren't too bad, as long as they require some variation and effort. In 4 you can watch a one minute YouTube video and you'll get 0-60 luigi shit. I'm hoping ult will require at least 5 minutes and a degree of memorization that exceeds that of a goldfish to get combos off.
                My friend thinks both Corrin and Cloud are pretty unbalanced whats your opinion on them?
                    Cloud is OP in doubles but fine everywhere else, top 5 character for sure. Corrin is decent. Nothing too OP, nothing impossible to deal with outside of a couple of matchups(Ness for one) 
                        Yeah my buddy is a great Cloud so that always got annoying haha. We dont talk much anymore though so I probably wont even be playing the new one with him 
            People miss Brawl because of SSE, not because of anything related to competitive.
            Very very few people say they miss brawl lol
                I liked subspace emissary a lot! Like the actual levels and collecting trophies with the trophy frisbee.  I thought that was so awesome. Pretty sad they didnt make it like that for this one but oh well. 
                    Oh I definitely agree. Subspace was one of the best things to ever happen in smash

But, even with the vocal minority in this thread, brawl is widely not missed.

Melee will last forever. Brawl and smash 4 will mostly likely not
                        I feel that each Smash game has an aspect of it that it will be remembered for... Except Smash 4.

I mean, 64 was the original, the game that started it all

Melee was and still is a competitive giant and where the series really started picking up steam

Yes, Brawl undeniably had its problems, but Subspace was an extremely cool concept and I can name a number of people I personally know that went back to Brawl fairly recently just to play through that again

And Ultimate, is, well, Ultimate.

But what does Smash 4 have?  I mean, we don't know this yet but Ultimate seems to be a much better game than Smash 4.  Not to mention 4 didn't really have any memorable stuff besides the actual battles, Smash Tour was eh, very little single player content, etc...

I just feel that in a few years, Smash 4 is going to be the game that we all have forgotten/don't care about.  More so than Brawl, because even though many prefer Smash 4 (as do I) Brawl tried harder to make itself distinct.
                            This is exactly how I've felt since Ultimate was revealed. Maybe Smash 4 will be remembered for customs? Maybe? But every other game has a unique gameplay style (64, Melee) and/or great single-player content (Brawl), and Ultimate, as well as being the newest game, has everything Smash 4 had plus worthwhile single-player. 
                            I will remember it for the competitive scene, third party characters (Cloud and Ryu announcement made me cry), and the most functional online in the series (so far, let's see what Ultimate has).

Edit: also, first portable experience and amiibos (regardless of how we feel about them, they were a sucess from a Sales point of view).
                        Smash 4 only because it looks like its the basis of Ultimate otherwise I think it would last as long as Melee because of how tight it is. 
                There is  lot of them, even in this thread, saying Sm4sh is the worse entry in the series.

Omni, which is one of my favorite smash youtubers, went as far as saying that competitively, Sm4sh and Brawl were almost the same, which doesn't make sense IMO.
    Woah, when did Mario Kart 9 come out?
        Now I want Scorpion in Mario Kart! Lol
            [Well then do I have a game for you! MK Armageddon had a kart racer mode included.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_boyufoODjI)
                This is fucking stupid and I love it so much!
        Mortal Kombat 9
    Woah there. Sf4 is objectively better than Sf5
    See also: every legend of Zelda game before the most recent release. 
    [deleted]
        Interesting, I though AE was the most poralizing SFIV installment. Still, is the one who made me start playing it! Lol
    We wont. It hasn't been like that and wont be like that for smash. That's also why brawl is dead and now smash 4 while melee is still alive.
    When Smash Super Ultra Grand Slam Mega Battle Royale comes out all the games will pale in comparison.
        You thought 8 player smash was fun? Wait until you play **MMO smash!!!!**
    the only problems i can think of would be lack of trophies and extra like the map maker and masterpieces.
I mean, yeah. Half my time watching the Direct videos was always spent thinking "Wow that's brilliant and obvious at the same time. Why the fuck didn't they do that in Sm4sh?" It's hard to deny that more thought and care seems to have been put into Ultimate. And if you're big on single player like me then Sm4sh didn't even look great to begin with.
    I think it's less about more thought and care being put into it and more the fact that they're not splitting their development resources so much by developing two different versions of the game.

Smash Wii U was held back so much by Smash 3DS.
        Yep, I’ll always say this. I loved Smash 3DS, and I’ll never regret the time I spent playing it in high school in the hallway with friends. But Sakurai made Smash 3DS pretty much an entirely separate game that had to be made exactly like the Wii U game, which was limited by the power of the 3DS. No Ice Climbers, etc. I’m surprised that they included 8 player Smash since it wasn’t in the 3DS version.
        At the same time, Smash 3DS's stagelist and game modes were better in a lot of ways than Smash Wii U's. Smash Run > Smash Tour, 3DS Classic > Wii U Classic, and 3DS had a lot of fantastic stages.

I'm really happy Ultimate is bringing in a lot of Smash 3DS stages, because they deserve more time in the limelight (or rather, the lifelight).
            COLORS WEAVE INTO A SPIRE OF FLAMES
Except people have been saying these same things about smash 4 since before it was even released. Smash 4 feels like what Brawl *should* have been, but most people in the scene didn't want that, they wanted a sequel to Melee. The reason the smash 4 hate is building is because people are scared that Ultimate is still gonna feel too much like brawl (i.e. defensive meta, huge mid+low tiers with a few nasty top tiers and gatekeeper high tiers who can't touch the top tiers but smash everyone else, floaty, no combos, different tech skill). Only time will tell if that's true, and I have a feeling that on release it will be, but there are signs of life, and it looks like the dev team is at least trying to skill index the game a bit better, which is good.

` ^ tl;dr ^ `  
` v Theorizing below v `

Personally, I have a hunch that whatever ends up being smash 6, if we get one and if it's not ruined by development hell, will end up being the "best" post-melee smash.

64 feels like a (very good) proof of concept, melee feels like the refined and extended version of that concept, but lacking a lot of modern polish, and actually not super great as a game for more than 2 people to play at a time, unless you're playing 2v2, particularly if people are unevenly skilled.

Brawl feels like sakurai realized he had a huge fucking IP in his hands and tried to make an ambitious singleplayer, while trying to refocus the game on being a game for 2-4 players of varying skill. It wasn't actually a bad idea, it was just too large in scope, and most people wouldn't have predicted esports was going to be any bigger than halo 2 LANs and brood war in korea, so the emphasis on making a fighter with really advanced play probably seemed like it was counterproductive, given smash was really seen as *the party game* for a lot of people.

Smash 4 of course came much later, and yet feels iterative in comparison to brawl. The newcomers are definitely amazing on the whole (even if cloud and bayo are fucking busted), and though it tries to promote more aggressive play, it tries to without changing the brawl formula too much, which as we all know just ended up in a shieldy, jankier game. (btw OP, "best gameplay in the series"? yeah right)

It looks like Ultimate is again somewhat iterative, but that the development team has realized the significance of the esports movement (and specifically melee's role in it), and is trying to make a game that plays more aggressively again and flows better, while further eliminating execution intensive tech skill and adding damage scaling for 1v1 battles so that the game plays a bit more similar across different levels of skill and gamemodes.

Smash 6, I would bet, is once again going to iterate upon the brawl formula, but will probably once again try to recapture some of the glamor of melee highlight reels. I wouldn't be surprised if there was some way to diminish the knockback on your own moves or something in order to extend combos, or maybe some rework of final smashes to be less OP and chargable by playing well, sortof like the FS meter in ultimate but less stupid. It will also surely come with some QoL improvements for ladder play, and I would bet it will have real support from nintendo as an esport, which is something they're obviously dabbling with in Splatoon.
    What have you seen that makes you think Ultimate's meta will be defensive? All the clips I have seem make it feel super offensive heavy.
This is probably it. I don’t hate 4, but the closer we get to the 7th, the worse 4 looks in retrospect. Plus, there were features or things in 4 that were irksome, but are being changed/fixed in ultimate. For me, it was that the stages were split between the games. I preferred playing on Wii U, while my favorite stages for 4 were on 3DS. I’m glad to have a unified game this time, which automatically makes 4 look worse. So, I agree, because we’re so close to a direct improvement, that the last games just look kinda bad at the moment.
Ultimate pretty much makes Smash 4 look like how Smash 4 made Brawl look.
Are people too dumb to grasp how sequels work?
    Yes. From a software development standpoint, this is like people getting mad that Nintendo is making improvements on a previous project.

I could understand someone being annoyed that "improvements" are being sold as a brand new game, but their are more than enough new features added to justify it.
This is so true. The same thing happened with Brawl.
    Brawl isn’t quite getting the “best game ever” treatment, but it is getting enough “my favorite smash” posts and loooads of praise for SSE. About every week here we get A post “i actually enjoyed SSE!” To the point where they’re dropping the “unpopular opinion:” disclaimer
        I always thought Brawl was far and away the worst one. Is that an uncommon opinion?
            Pretty much nobody says it was mechanically better as far as actual gameplay mechanics go. Everyone likes SSE though, and when people's say "I liked Brawl" that (and the stage editor) is what they mean. Then people confuse that with praise for mechanics for some reason.
                I will never say Brawl's mechanics were better than either Melee or Smash 4, and I do prefer Melee's single player adventure mode from a gameplay standpoint to SSE, but while I appreciate the ability to draw your own terrain, I missed Brawl's stage hazard options severely in its stage editor.  I literally could not re-create many of my favorite Brawl custom stages in Smash 4 because I didn't have the spikes, ladders, etc. I needed to make them.
            Not a horribly uncommon opinion but an opinion nonetheless. Having played through Smash 4 and having returned to melee, it does feel a bit clunky

To each their own really
            I think that's the common opinion, even though 64 is garbage
                64 might be garbage in terms of actual mechanics, but it has a lot of charm. A *whole* lot of charm.
                Hey man that’s my childhood your clocking in the face
                Huh? 64 is second best in mechanics after Melee. It's incredibly fun to watch, its combos are so good that it's the only game to feature a combo contest, and it's relatively balanced AFAIK. I don't think anyone says 64 is garbage. Pretty soon 64 tournaments will be bigger than Smash 4 tournaments. In 7 or 8 years 64 tournaments will be bigger than Ultimate tournaments. 
        >About every week here we get A post “i actually enjoyed SSE!” To the point where they’re dropping the “unpopular opinion:” disclaimer

The thing is people are simply tired of competitive Smash players glorifying Melee so much that most people simply upvote anything that praises Brawl, which was seen as a stark contrast to Melee. There's also the small but vocal people who actually do like SSE and will always upvote anything that praises something that really was universally hated when it came out.

Lastly, Brawl came out... almost a decade ago. We've been filled with enough younger gamers now who grew up on Brawl and likely have nostalgic memories of SSE that are clouding their opinions. You honestly see this with... LOTS of games most gamers hated in the past.

I see this with Super Paper Mario, Mario Sticker Star, SSBB, hell even Metroid: Other M. This is also true with non-Nintendo games like Final fantasy 13, Resident Evil 5, and Sonic 06. 

There really should be a term for this... Where people who hated games that were pretty definitively hated in the past are somehow replaced by a small but growing number of people who, for some reason, want to simply disagree with the overwhelming opinion at the time.
    Uh

When did Brawl go through the last two phases? 
        Competitive players still hate Brawl, but you also get a lot of people talking about how great SSE was these days. 
            That tripping mechanic was a pain though :(
            so true. The vocal opinion was everyone hated SSE until talks of a new story mode surfaced and all of a sudden it was like WOW FINALLY... SSE was GREAT! typical internet 
            Yea, if you liked SSE (Which I did) there’s an argument that Brawl has the best single-player modes in the series. I prefer Melee’s but think Brawl was a close second.
            [deleted]
                Mostly I think people just miss single player content.
                    And Coin launcher. I definitely miss coin launcher.
                        it was great until you needed those last 3 trophies for completion lol
                        Oh mannnn, I loved that game!  Much better than Smash 4's trophy rush, iirc.  (It's been so long since I had played either).
                        That coin launcher music was chill as hell too.
                Brawl is my favorite in the series hands down.

And thats not bullshit.

Now you have.
                    I never played 4, but as someone who prefers to play Smash as a party game and not as a competitive fighter, I definitely prefer Brawl over Melee. More stages, more characters, and a stage creator? Yes please. 
                        > but as someone who prefers to play Smash as a party game and not as a competitive fighter

So like, 90% of people who play the game, including the development team?

Smash was always a party game, and Brawl was a natural evolution of that.  Zany items, crazy hazards, tripping, stage creation...so many random elements to act and react to while laughing/fighting/arguing/etc. with friends.  That's what Nintendo prefers to make and always have.

Then, as usual, a subset of the fanbase decide to take it too far and needed to prove their *LEETskillz* by counting the invincibility frames on Jiggly Puff's j.2S and began demanding recognition and next thing you know, Smash tournaments are being held and unlike *every* other competitive fighting game that uses the full scope of *all* its mechanics, Smash tourneys need to have items off, stage hazards off, assist trophies off, pokeballs off, every random element stripped away and most of the game's features and mechanics shut down just to force it to function under "competitive rules".

It's a shame Sakurai and Co. have to cater to that side of it; I wonder what Smash could have been if it *wasn't* hounded by people trying to make it Melee instead of letting it be what it's trying to be.
                            >It's a shame Sakurai and Co. have to cater to that side of it; I wonder what Smash could have been if it wasn't hounded by people trying to make it Melee instead of letting it be what it's trying to be.

A good fighting game works on multiple levels. Sure, its fun to button mash with friends in, but having a viable competitive scene also helps give the series longevity and even extra exposure and free advertising for casual gamers. Brawl was fun as as a casual game, but for many players, that wasn't enough. They wanted a game that can also be a regular at EVO too. Keep in mind, Brawl was around the time that the Fighting game franchise was starting to see a resurgence with Street Fighter IV, and as eSports were becoming more and more popular, Brawl just looked tone deaf to a lot of people. 
                        Yea I agree, I just think melee is a broken mess with no balancing. I understand most of the love is because how fast it is but still.
                            If you think Melee is a broken mess with no balancing though, why do you like Brawl?

Really the only Smash which that doesn’t apply to is Smash 4, circa 2015, but Brawl was certainly the least balanced of the original three, and no less broken than the others.
                                This doesn’t go for everyone apparently, but I’ve experienced far less bugs and far less crazy broken combos other than meta knight.

I don’t play competitively so that’s probably why I feel it’s less broken, because every melee video I see is several characters being able to infinite combo, like ice climbers and fox and falco and crap like that.
                    Prat Brawls
                    Same actually. As a gamer who is bad at fighting games, I’ll never get into the competitive side. I can understand why the competitive players didn’t like it but I thought it was really fun and SSE was a really unique and entertaining campaign.
                SSE is one of the most important things to me for smash so brawl may stay my favorite 
                Personally I prefer the floatier gameplay of Brawl and Smash 4 is kinda similar but ruined some characters/stages and the AI for me. Also, no offline tournament mode?

Ultimate is looking good though, since it sounds like they fixed some of the problems I had with Sm4sh, but I haven't tried it yet.
                    As far as I can tell it fixes pretty much every shortcoming of Sm4sh.
                Well let me change that for you.

I have played every smash game since the 64 one. In fact, the Nintendo 64 smash brothers was the first video game I ever played, period. That said, Brawl is the greatest of the series so far. It looks like this new one has a chance of changing that, but it's not out yet, so we'll just have to wait and see.

                        Brawl is surely the worst tournament game, but as a casual game it has more stages and fighters than melee, and better single player content than SSB4. 
                            as a casual game my friends and I will probably never stop playing melee just because thats what we grew up on. I think brawl's art style aged really badly; it looks horrible while melee looks ok and 64 has its goofy charm.

The single player content was a lot of fun but i also played that 11 years ago and i doubt i would have as much fun now lol
                        I think you forget that competitive players are a very loud, but very very tiny minority of the players of smash.

99% of players would look at you like you're speaking a different language as soon as you mention project M

Edit: words are hard 
                        Fun fact, the internet is full of people willing to share opinions that differ from the majority of people. They also speak loudly.

(I like Brawl too, but its because I really don't like multiplayer and Brawl had a shitload more to do/collect than any other Smash game has... till now? Weird that you don't see people like that at Smash competitions though, eh?)
                        Pretty much everyone I know thinks Brawl is the best, it’s more accessible than melee and it was on a great console that everyone had to play with friends.

I get the competitive scene doesn’t like Brawl but for casual players the multiplayer was really good, and the SSE was a thing, so we love it.

When my university hosts tournaments (remember this isn’t a competitive tournament, it’s to let people join in and have fun) it uses Brawl still
                Brawl is by far my 2nd favourite of the series, so I guess I'm one of the weird never seen anybody's.
                It's the most sold in the series and I've heard casuals say Brawl is the best bc subspace + really strong roster. 
                Brawl was my favorite so far because of the single player content which was far superior in comparison to previous and future titles.
                I literally have seen somebody talk about how great Brawl is in comparison to the other games.
                I liked brawl... 
                Brawl is the best.  

                [deleted]
                    > It was a great step forward.

Casually, yes, Brawl was a brilliant game.  Competitively, it's horrible.  A random 1% chance of tripping every time you dash is stupid.  A character that can literally turn invisible and invincible for infinite amounts of time does not make for a good competitive game.  And if you think I'm exaggerating, [I'm not](https://www.ssbwiki.com/Infinite_Dimensional_Cape).  And that's far from the only competitive problem Brawl has, balance is another.  Brawl Ganondorf is considered the worst fighting game character ever, and Meta Knight is considered the most broken, overpowered Smash character ever.  Needless to say, it's nearly impossible for Ganon to beat MK.

Now casually, none of this matters.  You're just playing to have fun, so the balance issues, while noticeable, are excusable.  And for single player modes, it's definitely the best game due to Subspace Emissary alone. Nobody will argue with you there.

Brawl died because it's a flawed game competitively, and Smash 4 will die because there's no reason to play it over Ultimate.  But Melee lives on because it's still unique, and offers interactions that no other Smash game has been able to or even really tried to replicate.  Even though I much prefer playing Smash 4, I still prefer watching Melee due to  its intricate movement allowing for more competitive depth compared to the newer games.  

And it's not like Melee players haven't tried playing the newer games.  M2K played Brawl and Smash 4 at a high level, even being the best in Brawl at the time.  Mango tried Brawl.  Leffen, Armada, and tons of other Melee players tried Smash 4 when it first came out.  

I hope this helps you understand why good game != good competitive game necessarily.  Mario Party is a good game, but not a good competitive game.
                    The Smash ball point is such a great point, I feel like I only just realized those started in Brawl, and what a great addition too
                        Assist Trophies also debuted in Brawl, which are amazing. 
                    > competitive players don't like change and Brawl represents that Smash is not a static game.

When the changes make the game objectively bad from a competitive standpoint, yeah
                    Ah yes here's the obligatory "Melee players don't change" trite. Nevermind the fact that people take shits on melee every few hours without actually understanding anything about it and its community. Many top Melee players including the infamously "hateful" Leffen have expressed interest in playing Ultimate. 


Also why are people so hellbent on getting melee players to "move on"? Nobody in here is telling people who love Brawl more to move on. When Mario Odyssey came out did that make anyone who plays the older Mario games someone who "doesn't like change"? Brawl was a wonderful game casually, but when you can literally just trip randomly at any time in a run, it's kind of hard to play seriously. Your interests may differ from mine, but can we stop the "Melee players hate anything not Melee because they're hateful showerless assholes" rhetoric?
            At the risk of sounding like a hipster, this annoys me a bit because I’ve been on that SSE from day 1. 
            What's SSE?
                Subspace Emissary, the story mode from Brawl.
            i mean you had people saying those positive things about SSE from the beginning

everyone thought the cutscenes were cool, and almost nobody liked the gameplay

though i guess the verdict shifted from more generally negative to generally positive, but i think that’s just bc more younger players are talking about it
            Competitive player who liked Brawl here.

But I was a dirty planking Pit main, too hipster to play MK and actually win anything.
            I see people saying that Brawl was underrated and that SSE was great.  


Those things are both wrong, but I see them said more often the farther we get from the game
                oi SSE was my juice when I was a kid, the boss battles were some of the most fun I've had with the series
                    The boss battles and cutscenes were both nice, but I think people seem to have forgotten all the bits in between that where you have to slog through those dollar store Heartless was actually pretty damn awful.
        A lot of people on r/smashbros praise Brawl for basically everything other than it’s gameplay. It has a great OST, good roster, solid single player content, a lot of extra game modes that weren’t as good in Smash 4. The gameplay still sucks though.
        It's going through them approximately right now
        I'm starting to see more and more people saying Brawl was better than Smash 4.
            I'm amazed that so many people can be so very wrong.
                They're not, people just conflate different parts of the game.

Brawl had much better single player modes than 4, a better roster that melee. Just about everything about it was great... except the actual gameplay mechanics.

When people say "I really liked Brawl", 9 times out of 10 they're talking about Subspace Emissary, not competitive gameplay mechanics.
    As far as I know most people still don't like brawl nearly as much as 4 or melee.

Brawl they intentionally made it uncompetitive. I think most casual players and smash fans like it, it was fun. But it was shitty Nintendo wanted you to play they way they wanted.

For what ever reason they didn't like it became a competitive fighter, and did things to try and stop it. Also brawl had straight up OP characters. 
    The difference is that Brawl is mostly praised nowadays for its solid and abundant singleplayer content, whereas smash 4 is arguably one of the most lacking in singleplayer in the whole series. I’m not saying that this alone means that Smash 4 won’t be remembered fondly, but that if it is remembered fondly, it’ll be for completely different reasons than Brawl.
    No Brawl is just actually bad.

It had a terrific single player, but the multiplayer was a massive step down from Melee in basically every single way. Also Metaknight was so broken and overpowered that he was banned from tournaments. 
    lol, except Brawl is still looked down upon.
    I still hate the core gameplay of brawl, the slow floaty style wasn't fun. Melee is probably tied with 4 for me. Melee challenges were awesome.
This definitely works with Pokémon (ignoring certain sequels etc)
Right now Let's Go is the best thing ever, Sun & Moon is overrated, XY is the worst game ever, Black and White are underrated gems and Diamond and Pearl are the best games ever

Five years ago it was completely different.

(For the record, that isn't my opinion, it's the opinions I see most often)
    This is almost perfect, but let’s go has been way more polarising than you give it credit for. And I think there’s a sizeable contingent like me who think it’s, you know, fine.
    The best part of this is that you can already see things beginning to change, with Black & White being considered the best game ever by many and X & Y being underrated gems.

Let's Go is a bit of an outlier though, since it's so different from what's generally expected from one of the main games.
        It feels like BW was hated by so many people for so long, I'm glad it's starting to get more appreciation!
            I've played ORAS, XY, DP and BW all in a couple years and not in order so the cycle is not really something I experienced first hand. Still, I love BW (and hate DP).
                DP will always be my favourite because it was my very first Pokémon game, and I actually got all the badges and beat the elite 4. XY was nice change in graphics but felt too iterative (not that all the others weren’t). ORAS was kind of the same deal. I actually played BW after all of those, and while the story felt pretty cool, it was hard to go back to those graphics and play style after XY and ORAS.
    Let’s GO! is the best thing ever? Sure it’s been successful and I for one have been enjoying it too. But I’ve seen more hate for those games than I’ve seen praise.
        It really depends where you look. Among existing Pokémon fans it's really unpopular because of cutting out a lot of the depth, but among casual players, Let's Players etc. it's being hailed as a return to form after 20 years of decline.

Back when Brawl was first released it actually got a lot of the same stuff; a lot of casual fans claimed it was a huge improvement over Melee, partly because of the high amount of content, but also because they want Smash to be solely a party game.
            It definitely [depends](https://youtu.be/X2YfNeBxGLg) on where you [look](https://youtu.be/c66IR3qA5-w)
    anybody saying gen 4 are the best games was literally born in like 2002 and you can't prove me wrong
        I'm pretty sure (and I say this as someone who thinks gen 4 is best gen) that whatever game most people currently entering their 20s grew up with is what's going to be considered the best gen. Right now gen 4 seems to be the most popular. A few years ago you'd be crucified if you didn't think gen 3 was the best. And recently I've started to see a lot of "BW/B2W2 are underrated gems" type posts. I'm willing to bet that within the next year or two gen 5 is going to be seen as the best gen.
            it's really more of the natural ebb and flow of the fanbase. when 3-4 came out, they were kinda panned by the community. that being said, the community was gens 1-2-heavy back then. as those people sortied because they became disinterested/disinvested in the series (for whatever reason that may be), the community gradually becomes filled with people who started 3-4. and of course, as those people leave you'll see more 5-6..... and so on.
            Am gen 4 fan, will stay gen 4 fan.
        You can make this same post about Super Mario Sunshine
        2000, try again kiddo
            same difference
        They're the second best, 1996.
        1998 here, old enough to have experienced it and gen 3 around the same time. Still think it's the best ;)
        2003, ahaha!
        I started on Red in the 90s and have played every gen (except Let's Go) and Platinum is still my favorite. Amazing tunes, a dope sprawling region that itself was the size of Kanto and Johto from G/S/C combined, and a fun villain to boot.

&#x200B;

I would be so hyped for the eventual remake if I wasn't thinking that Let's Go changed how that's going to play out.
        Diamond and Pearl were utter trash. Platinum improved alot, but Sinnoh still had some fundamental flaws. 

HGSS is fucking pure unadulterated awesome. 
    People actually say that about XY? What?

I'm a huge Pokemon fan and it seems like the general consensus is that Sun and Moon are awful, but XY were pretty great, just not as good as Black/White.

A lot of "true" Pokemon fans seem to think Black/White were the last "good" Pokemon games, but there's still a lot of love for XY. Sun and Moon are universally panned for pandering and the horrible amount of handholding.
    That's because it is built by the people that were young when those games came out. 10 years later those people are able to voice opinions loudly and they do so.

I remember when Windwaker came out and everyone was hating on it, now all you see is the love for that game. they tend to a lot of the time be people that were <10 when it came out.
This literally happened with Mario the other day on this very sub.  3D World was criticized when it came out and people wanted an open-ended game again, now Mario Odyssey is apparently shit and 3D World is an underrated masterpiece.  I agree 3D World is a great game, but the need to constantly put down another game in favor the one you like at the moment is just so bizarre.   Granted, it doesn’t happen with Mario fans as bad as it does with Zelda and Pokemon fans, but still.
Black and white was always underated.
    People have shit on the Unova games for a while, but I’ve always liked them. The 2.5 D graphics and the animated sprites were a huge bonus for me, and while there were a few bad designs (Garbodor, Sawk/Throw, Clink, Amoongus) there’s a lot of good designs too (Zoroark, Chandelure, Haxorus, Reniculus). People get hung up on the negatives, but it also has some pretty good positives. I like Team Plasma and N since they actually had a pretty decent argument for what they were doing. The Aesthetic of the region was something I really loved. Black 2 and White 2 were really cool additions to the region as a sort of sequel, something that not a lot of other Pokémon games have done. There was an abundance of legendaries, but the core trio of Zekrom, Reshiram, and Kyrurem were good designs, and the Black Kyurem/White Kyurem lore was pretty cool too.
        Yeah I felt they poorest their heart and soul to make an as interesting as possible world and lure and then when it didn't sell well (even though pokemon has sold worse and worse each gen) they decided to scrap that idea and go hyper kid friendly and simplistic (whilst making the actual core of the game more complex)
            the series's sales have largely stabilized since the end of Pokemania after Gen 2. there are minute fluctuations in sales that can largely be attributed to timing. BW's lower sales can be attributed to coming so very late in the DS's lifespan.
            Pokémon isn't selling worse each gen. X and Y sold better than Black and White. 
    Really? Talking about how good gen five is seems like it's been the popular opinion to have for quite a while now.
    I hated them, just because of the Pokemon choices. Absolutely a matter of opinion, I'm sure they're well-loved in general.
I call this the Zelda Cycle. Very soon it will be Skyward Swords turn up on top, BOTW is already hovering around overrated - worst game status. 
    The thing with Skyward Sword is that it's difficult to play without having a Wii (which is a total bitch to use on modern TVs) or a Wii U. (Enough said)

The only option otherwise is to use Dolphin and a Wii Motion Plus remote, which requires a pretty baller PC and a lot of technical jiggery.

This will either harm the game's reputation overall by making it so that people can't go back and re-evaluate it, or it'll give it a mistique, causing a certain degree of rose-tinted glasses. Tough to say. We'll see if it gets ported to Switch, I guess.

        That’s not the only issue with SS. The constant babying by Fi telling you how to solve every puzzle. The repetitive nature of the dumb collect the head time trials. And my two biggest reasons for disliking the game is a lack of towns/villages filled with side quests and NPCs and the lack of a true overworked except the empty sky. 
    Skyward sword was a bad Zelda game and I will never change my opinion. 
Everyone hated windwaker until they realized it was probably top 4 in the franchise.
    Eh. I think the people that hated Windwaker back when it came out really just hated the animation style and never actually played it. 
They are in the process of doing that to Fallout 4 currently. It's on the uphill now that 76 is out. 
    Sure it’s happening with 4, but New Vegas never got called bad or anything during the 4 hype train.
It's true with all games, and even a lot of music, released now. No games can escape it, whether it's fallout 76 or farming simulator.
It's happening with Fallout 4 right now. It got a lot of hate because it didn't carry over the RPG elements and great dialogue and characters from the previous games and but now that Fallout 76 are showing everyone how crappy the franchise can actually get people are calling Fallout 4 a masterpiece. Personally I always thought it was a masterpiece but it's just kind of stupid to see everyone on the internet suddenly agreeing with me when I've been fighting people on this for 3 years
    I still don’t really care for Fallout 4. Got to the fight with the deathclaw and decided shortly after that the game just wasn’t my cup of tea.

> Pokemon franchise

I can't wait for people to finally see Ultra Sun & Ultra Moon for how good they actually are. (No sarcasm)
    As for someone who plays Pokemon competitively I think Gen 7 is by far one of the most fun to play with. Gen 6 had a lot of changes at once and were a total mess. Gen 7 had those changes more stabilized.
    No. USM is worse than SM. It put a new story on the SM story and put no effort into adjusting it. Character arcs made no sense. It was a total mess. SM had problems, but the Story had a visable focus with evolving characters. USM spit on it.
        No Pokemon game has a good story. I know it's a controversial opinion, but truthfully, they don't. They'll have some well written characters for sure (N and Lillie come to mind), but overall the stories are always the exact same with minor differences. Always bland.

When I say USUM are good, and I do mean better than SM, it's purely from a non-story perspective. Gameplay, environments, "boss" battles, etc.
             The improvements were  minor. A few more minigames here a few harder battles there. And in my opinion SM had a good story. Not an innovative but a solid story with good characters. 
And the drop of quality storywise can't be saved by these few minor changes.
    Are they worth it for people who didn't like Sun/Moon? My biggest gripe is definitely the excessive tutorial time, and the rest of the game I thought was decent, but it never really grabbed me.
        Well, it's basically the same game with, imo, better stuff. The boss fights are a lot better, especially the late game one. I think it has a better story too, although it's almost identical.

Thing is, is a lot of the "tutorials" remain. Now, personally, I don't really think they were tutorials. It was just a lot of cutscenes for the story. Obviously, the story isn't really great, so the cutscenes aren't enjoyable.

Still though, I think it's the best Pokemon game we've had so far.
> I constantly see this with the Zelda and Pokemon franchise.

I don't. I see people suggesting there is a cycle but the truth begs to differ.
    Yeah, no one hated on Link Between Worlds, and no one is calling Triforce Heroes a hidden gem. There hasn't been a switch of opinion on the most recent Zelda games at all.
        For Zelda, it tends to be the major home console releases that are subject to the cycle. That said, there didn't seem to be a shift in opinion with BotW's release.
            You might see a very small amount of people call TP ot SS their favourite but no way did major opinion shift on them. Just when people disliked them, people were crying "the cycle!"
            There wasn't a shift in opinion when SS released, either.
    It happened once with TWW, and that was it. If anything, the cycle is just "who's the louder part of the fanbase at this moment".
Happens with Final Fantasy also
This happens every new doctor... wait wrong franchise
Also true with the Fallout franchise.

Not defending Fallout 76 though.
It’s the outrage culture reddit and other sites are obsessed with. People like being angry. You’re seeing it with Red Dead currently, and you’ll see it with every major release more or less unless the studio putting the game out is from one of Reddit’s favourite companies, like CDPR.

Fallout 76 is a good example where we saw the media jumping on board. I’m not saying the game is good, because from all accounts it isn’t, but every ridiculously low score you saw made the front page of gaming. There was sites giving Fallout 76 a 2 that don’t normally even review games, all so that they’d get on the front page and get some free publicity. Reddit has become the place to complain about games and gaming culture instead of celebrate it.
Fun Fact: Brawl actually has the highest Metacritic score of the entire series. 
I'm a big Ace Attorney fan and that franchise has it in spades.  Apollo Justice was the franchise's black sheep when Dual Destinies released, and now in the couple years since Spirit of Justice, Apollo Justice is more fondly remembered and Dual Destinies is the supposedly worst one.  If there's an Ace Attorney 7 it will be inevitable that Dual Destinies' stock will go up and Spirit of Justice's popularity will nose-dive.
No one will ever say smash 4 was the best game ever.
the Zelda pattern doesn’t really apply to Smash Bros.

no one was singing Brawl’s praises in 2015, that’s for sure

also, the Zelda pattern’s shifted.  like with WW, they complained immediately and called ot the best thing ever a year later.  with SS, everyone loved it when it came out, and hated it a year later
“Wow the [game] was so underrated”
I agree. 8 player smash is a fun party mode but it's not great for classic.
Mine was the name of the game(s). And also the initially confusing menus.
One of my favorite ways to play Smash 4 was with 1 or 2 actual players and 6 or 7 CPU players all level 1, timed stock. Then we'd try to rack up as many KOs as possible.
Thought it had the worst 1-P mode of any Smash period. Classic on Wii U sucked for the reason you said, there was no Adventure mode, they replaced break the targets with a crappy alternative, Smash Tour sucked, Orders mode was ok but like super fun, nor did it have race to the finish.
    Wait how can you play race to the finish in 3DS?
MULTI MAN MELEE
I discovered Xenoblade through Smash 4, so was playing through it while playing smash 4.  For anyone that hasn't played Xenoblade 1, there's a pretty massive spoiler regarding a character you see early in the game that comes up in a huge twist later.

Smash Tour spoiled that twist for me with a fucking trophy name.  Those two words were the equivalent of "Snape kills Dumbledore" for me.
    Wtf Snape kills Dumbledore????
    And now Ultimate just straight up spoils it with Shulk’s final smash
Genuine question, why do people hate Smash Tour so much? It was honestly my favorite mode from Smash 4, I'm disappointed they didn't expand on it in Ultimate 
    You must've had people to play with locally. Smash Tour is the least engaging single player mode in all of Smash. I'd take Smash Run or Subspace over Smash Tour any day of the week.
Smash Tour is a great part mode. pokeball fighting was the best.
Smash tour wasnt even that bad. I dint get why it constantly gets hate
Tbh I actually agree with a LOT of those complaints (emphasis on a lot, not ALL). I love Sm4sh but it is definitely very flawed and have been saying most of these things for years....

...But the thing for me that  still makes Sm4sh great is how fun the actual fight lasts are. Smash 4 has probably my favorite actual gameplay and roster balance in the series. No other Smash since 64 has had so many enjoyable characters that I felt were viable. Not speaking competitively, but personally I felt the Mid to lower tiers in Sm4sh were more fun and salvageable than in Melee or Brawl.

So in retrospect, probably the least well-rounded Smash but it at least still got the “main” part right, imo.
Exactly this honestly. Brawl was not great competitively but offered a lot to the casual player whereas Smash 4 was better competitively but still lacking and the casual experience was arguably worse than Brawl's. Funnily enough it seems that Ultimate is trying to do both and looks to be succeeding, at least on the competitive front. It remains to be seen whether World of Light, Spirits Board and Classic have enough staying power for people playing on their own.

    While it looks way better than Smash 4, I wouldn’t say they’re succeeding with competitive play. It’s still obvious that Sakarai has no idea why people love Melee so much. It’s not about having a lot of characters.
        According to impressions of a surprising number of Melee players, it seems they're succeeding down that road more than you think.

>It’s still obvious that Sakarai has no idea why people love Melee so much.

No, he knows exactly why people love Melee so much. It's very obvious though that he doesn't want to make that kind of game again.
        He knows why there is a die hard part of the competitive smash community that wants another melee. He’s said before in interviews that he doesn’t like how punishing it can be nor the exploits that came from some interactions.

He wants the series to go in the direction Smash 4 did for overall play with ultimate going further down that road.
Wow, well said. Thanks for taking the time to comment. 
Quality comment. Really agree with custom moves
> Its made worse when you realize characters like Palutina were designed to show off customs, and as a result they basically were left at the bottom of the tiers.

And this is why I'm going to do everything in my power to main Palutena in this game! All shall know her glory!
For the love of God, Nintendo doesn’t make these games, Bandai Namco does.
> Corrin, Cloud, and Bayo were so top tier that tournament rankings basically became a lot of those 3. The fact that they were also DLC made people feel like they were sorta pay to win.

Corrin's not top tier and has no where near the number of players as Bayo and Cloud. I remember people on r/smashbros being surprised that she turned out to be "just" high tier. I agree with your other points, but this is just false info.
    Your right about Bayo and Cloud being extremely dominant, but Corrin was still had a fair ammount of presence in the top tiers.  
Upvoted for the “starter pokemon’s awkward middle stage evolution” remark
    And subjective newcomers. Let's not forget how great Melee and Brawl's were. 
        What? Sm4sh had some *tight* newcomers. Mega Man, Little Mac, Shulk, Ryu, Cloud, Rosalina. That's good shit
            I'm not saying it doesn't, but Brawl had Sonic and Snake (groundbreaking at the time), and Melee had some of the biggest Nintendo characters added, like Peach and Bowser.
                To be fair, with each new game, the prospect of crowd-pleasing, jaw-dropping newcomers gets lower and lower because previous games have already included them.
            Little Mac and Cloud are the only two out of those that I enjoy playing as.
Yeaaah, tbh Smash 4 is the only smash game I’ve ever burned out on. 64? Dang, it’s so fun to go back to sometimes! Melee? This game was my *childhood.* Brawl? Oh my gosh, subspace emissary was the best, I have so many precious memories of the hype preceding brawl, and this game was *always* fun to play for me. But with Smash 4, the more I played it - especially Classic mode, which somehow felt lifeless compared to the previous games despite technically being bigger (I wonder if my dislike of the Master Core fights compared to Master Hand had anything to do with it) - the more I grew to dislike it.
This. While no smash game has been perfect every other game Melee and Brawl both felt like they added (or tried to add) something to the series. The fact it was even called Smash Bros Wii U instead of something like Melee, Brawl, or Ultimate really sums it up.
You’re mostly into old school Nintendo stuff but Little MAC and Mega Man didn’t do it for you??
    I cared little for *most* of the additions, I didn't say I didn't like any of them. Those two were by far the best newcomers imo.
        Fair fair. For me I gotta be honest I’m a GameCube kid and Sunshine was my shit so seeing Bowser Jr was really all I needed. Having Mewtwo back was huge. Ultimate is gonna be amazing.
            That Shadow Mario final smash made me so happy
Brawl is automatically the worst Smash game because of tripping.
    From a competitive standpoint yeah, but the single player content is fun.
    Who still gives a fuck about that shit  
It barely happens and it's barely of any consequence
        Objectively its just a bad mechanic that was ment to make the game more balanced. 

It didnt happen as often as some people say it did, but it happens enough to be noticable. It mess up your flow/combo and generally sucks. Ive died because of tripping and Ive seen plenty of people die because of it too. It doesnt feel satisfying to anyone.

When you trip, your opponent isnt getting lucky, your getting unlucky. There no counter mechanic that compensates for it. You cant accidentally have you attack do extra damage. 

All it does is add an unfair element of luck to the game, and in a fighting game thats pretty awful.

 
            It is objectively a bad mechanic and i'm happy with its removal  
But the effect is small enough to barely matter in the grand scheme of things and certainly isn't anywhere near enough to make Brawl the worst Smash game. 
                Your right, its not the reason. Brawls problems run a lot deeper than just one bad mechanic. 
        1-2% chance to instantly lose your life when you move is something a lot of people give a fuck about when they're tryna win.

Nothing like losing a few hundred $$$ because you tripped
            Competitive Smash is less than 10% of the game's enjoyability. That 10% might suck in Brawl, but you still have a whole bunch of single player modes and multiplayer parties with heavilly very customizable rulesets, etc...  
And besides, if you trip, it's not as if you're 100% guaranteed to lose your life. Even in a competitive match. Fuck, i dare say that less than half of trips immediately result in a lost stock. It's less a stun and more like an interruption
                competitive smash is less than 1% of the games enjoyability. The competitive scene is extremely small, and the mechanic itself was just a giant fuck you to the competitive community because sakurai didnt like them or something.

You're not guaranteed to lose your life but against good players it happens all the time, simply because once they get you where they want you to be they dont let you go until you're dead
        > barely of any consequence

Hardly. You trip anywhere near another player that's a stock gone.
        Lol no. Happens often and can cost you a stock easily. The most ridiculous idea ever implemented in Smash. 
[deleted]
    Right? It wasn't necessarily a bad mode, but it sure as hell wasn't classic.
I was shocked when I heard that those were the actual real titles.
[deleted]
    Yeah, people were really disappointed when Smash 4 didn’t have an Adventure mode, but the gameplay in Subspace Emissary wasn’t great.

The cutscenes were cool, but don’t really provide much after you’ve watched them a couple times.
Yeah, my biggest complaint was the complete lack of compelling single player on the 3DS. It was hard to play with friends because they all needed their own system, and it was hard to play on your own because the single player wasn't great.
The internet is shit. 
    The internet is not something you just dump something on.
        It's a series of tubes.
            Green, plumber-sized tubes right?
        Clearly not everyone got that memo. 💩
The single player story was cut because Sakurai didn't like that you could just look up the ending online. He thought it would cheapen the game. 

I'm thinking that he got enough criticism afterwards for his ridiculous remarks that he changed his mind and decided to add a story mode back in to Ultimate.

I'm quite a fan of 64 and I'd maintain it's not purely down to nostalgia. I quite like how broken the characters the whole cast is. I'm  not a fan of shielding either and it's very weak in that game.
    People dont give 64 enough credit (probably cause theyre too young ti have played it) but the combo contests and sick 0-to-deaths push it above Brawl and Smash 4.
        Also, Smash 64's sound effects are amazing!
    0 to death Kirby combos feel incredible.
Melee’s physics aren’t glitched. They were designed that way.
    True, but there were certainly lots of glitches in melee, some that make certain characters unplayable (game and watch
        How is Mr. G&W glitched?
            His shield doesn't even cover himself so he can still be hit.
Same boat here, I've disliked *Wii U* for years because of the horrendous single player (especially compared to *3DS*'s modes.) Crazy Orders was the only interesting mode even if the novelty wore quick, everything else was either watered down from previous games or just a step in the wrong direction.

Going forward I'm sure I'll still boot up Smash Run from time to time, but good riddance to Smash Tour and the Rival mechanic.
I've heard  everyone talking about subspace emissary lately and I havent played brawl for a few years so I said I'll play it all over again, got halfway through and stopped. It was fine but I didnt love it on release and I feel the same way now
    It was significantly better than anything Smash 4 put forward.

The cutscenes alone were worth it.
        Cut scenes were definitely very good and I didnt have a wii u so I didnt play that version of smash 4 much, I mostly played on 3ds
I haven't really felt that way before about new smash games. When I heard brawl was coming out I was excited, but still had a lot of fun playing melee when I got it. Same thing with smash 4. Brawl, while floaty, is enjoyable.
Competitive players have been hating on Smash 4 for much longer than the amount of time Ultimate has been in the picture. Can’t speak for casuals though.
I loved Cloud in Smash 4 tbh...but you're right that most of them atleast weren't that fun.
Something about Anti hating Smash4 despite being a top level competitor is extremely cathartic. Smash4 was a miserable tournament game for me, even before the awful DLC characters.
Tbh, I honestly thought 64 and Brawl's gameplay was better than Smash 4's.
    Brawl was my first so i'm biased, but Smash 4 got tiresome really fast. It's like it punished you for trying to do cool shit
        I remember bodying someone with Smash 4 Marth, than random Smash 4 dank happens, and I actually lose the match...it happens a lot...Smash 4 is unbelievably random and inconsistent in competitive play.

Melee and 64, I would feel I deserve the lost, but in Smash 4 there was genuinely bullshit going on that actually made me lose the match and feel genuinely cheated.
Very true
https://goo.gl/images/Pz9Scz
Agree a million percent. Game felt like moving through sludge 
>Brawl competitively over Smash 4 anyday.

I think it's mostly due to Rage. I remember him saying, he hated it more than tripping because it led to a lot of upsets for him. I personally disagree because Rage is conceptually at least, a calculated mechanic the player can control. Rage's problem in Smash 4 was that it could be janky, which leads to characters that should've had no chance at winning, winning anyway. Ultimate fixes the two main problems with rage, namely toning down knock-back and removing Weight Dependent Knockback.

That, and Bayonetta came along so make of that what you will. 
[deleted]
Brawl is really slow tbh.
This is very true...honestly Smash 4 felt like a NSMB Smash to me.

Brawl and Melee are my favorites, but Ultimate looks great.

Brawl's actually my second favorite.

But that shouldn't make it 'shit' or 'garbage'.  Do people consider the OG Smash for N64 shit?  Because every entry in the series has improved upon it considerably.  Compared to even it's direct sequel (Melee) it's basic af.  But that doesn't make it a bad game, just an earlier entry in the series.  Sequels improving upon their predecessors is supposed to be the natural progression of video games.
    This is the internet. Everything is the best or worst of all time. Everything is either 5 stars or 1 star. Nuance is dead. Hyperbole is king. 
        This comment is the best or worst of all time.





Just joking around, I agree for the most part. The internet favours the extremes and the limit cases.
        Only a Sith deals in absolutes.
            But... that's an absolute.
                Thats intended
    Well Smash is weird because many, many people will say that Melee is and will always be the best and that all are other smash games are downgrades.

&#x200B;
        Well, for a competitive player of top level, this is always going to be true. All around as a game is a completely different story.
            But what if I scream "nostalgia" at you?
    Ya, it’s something that people seem to forget rather quickly. Granted, the staleness of Smash 4 never quite reached Brawl’s level, but towards the end here it’s definitely been noteworthy.
    It's far from being "garbage", but it seems to me like Smash 4 is receiving more hate than usual because, unlike the first three Smash games, it doesn't offer much that would make someone come back to it after its successor comes out. 64 is the starting point of the series and still feels unlike any other Smash game, Melee's technical gameplay and tournament scene will keep it going for years to come, and Brawl has Subspace. Smash 4 doesn't really seem to offer anything right now that Ultimate or another Smash game doesn't have; the only things really unique to it are Smash Tour, its take on Classic Mode and Target Blast, none of which were very well-received, and Smash Run on 3DS, which is a game that's been largely ignored anyway since the release of the Wii U version. Ultimate is the closest thing to a straight upgrade over its predecessor on all fronts we've seen from a Smash game so far, and Smash 4's reputation will suffer for it. Maybe someday people will come back around to it, but I don't really think it's going to get the same level of pseudo-revival that Brawl has gotten in the last few years.
It's  still stupid to complain, it's only a good job if the new iteration is better than the past
I get it, but to a casual smash player, Smash 4 is a very solid game. Great roster. Good stages. My second biggest gripe is that I can't turn off stage bosses. My biggest gripe is that Lucario is broken as sit and if you can keep him on stage past 130%, you almost one shot a 20% person and that's broken as shit.
You don't know Smash.  They'll be talking about how much they miss Melee.
    This. It always comes back to melee
        64 smash or nothin
            I prefer smash on the Atari 2600, thank you very much.

The Atari was the best Nintendo
        and there’s a reason for that
    I think these are two different demographics. Most Melee fans never cared so much about Sm4sh, and they won't care about Ultimate either.
        [deleted]
            But will they play it competitively? I am not sure. Melee is so unique...
            It's not a stretch that the 10% who said 'no' make up the majority of the hardcore players who shit on all other Smash games.  'Silent majority' is a thing after all.
        Agreed, the people who always come back to Melee are hardcore Melee fans. A lot of casual fans (like myself, although I consider myself a “hardcore” fan of Smash, just not competitive ) still love Melee but, at least for me, I don’t always come back to Melee.
        Huge Melee Fan, super stoked for Ultimate.
        None of the other games have attempted to recreate what drew the melee players to the game in the first place. Melee was extremely fast paced and had a high skill floor and ceiling, which is great for serious gamers but made the game inaccessible to a large part of the target demographic. Nintendo has since dumbed the game down quite a bit, which is great for accessing that market but loses the small minority of very competitive players in the process.
        Ehhh, I was a huge Melee fan, hated Brawl but Sm4sh was easily my favorite smash game mehanics wise at least
What is MK9?
    Mortal Kombat 9
        Ah ok thanks, already feared I missed a new Mario Kart
        Michael Kors 9
Honestly as long as we don’t have another Bayo situation then it’ll take a lot to get anyone who cares about the game competitively to miss Smash 4.
    Bayo was easy compared to Brawl MK, and people still say they miss Brawl, lol.

And I think we should expect at least 2014 Diddy situation.
        It’s not necessarily a matter of who was more oppressive, because the obvious answer is MK. Bayo was just so boring to watch and basically destroyed Smash 4’s competitive scene because no one wanted to watch Bayo all the time.

I’m positive we’ll have a broken ass character at launch but that’s what patches are for. Smash 4 was really close to being pretty well balanced but unfortunately was topped by Bayo.
            I agree with everything you said, but I don't think I made my point clear.

The problem is about perception. As the time goes on, people will give less weight to Sm4sh's flaws and more weight to Ultimate's.
            Some of these 0deaths in ult do scare me. It depends on how much of the cast they work on and whether it's possible to (S)DI out of them, but I'm not looking forward to stuff like luigi just fishing for a grab at 0% to do dthrow dair dair dthrow dair dair upB. That's just as bad as smash 4 bayo combos. If a lot of characters have 0deaths like that, I swear snake/links/pichu will literally be counter meta because they can put themselves at %s those combos don't work at.
                The difference is that while those 0deaths in Ult are scary, they're not autocombos. Like, different SDI patterns and techs in the right direction can get you off the trail, and the aggressor does need to be ready to improvise to keep it up.

What makes it different is the fact that it's not an autocombo. That was Bayo's and Brawl IC's and Melee IC's problems--once most characters got caught in witch twist or infinite chain grab or wobbling, you might as well put your controller down because you're hardly getting out of that one.
                    Well, that puts me at ease then.
                        Yeah honestly seeing all these zero to deaths and such is getting me mad excited because I'm seeing so many options that look both challenging and rewarding to pull off. The engine for this game looks so damn clean.
                            It does look hype, I'm just hoping there will be some real depth to the combos. I was absolutely done with smash4 because, no matter what character you picked, mario players were *always* going to fish for a grab because dthrow uptilts is true until 40-60%. Luigi was always going to do some 0-60 shit. Bayo was always going to get the same 0-death shit.

0-deaths aren't too bad, as long as they require some variation and effort. In 4 you can watch a one minute YouTube video and you'll get 0-60 luigi shit. I'm hoping ult will require at least 5 minutes and a degree of memorization that exceeds that of a goldfish to get combos off.
            My friend thinks both Corrin and Cloud are pretty unbalanced whats your opinion on them?
                Cloud is OP in doubles but fine everywhere else, top 5 character for sure. Corrin is decent. Nothing too OP, nothing impossible to deal with outside of a couple of matchups(Ness for one) 
                    Yeah my buddy is a great Cloud so that always got annoying haha. We dont talk much anymore though so I probably wont even be playing the new one with him 
        People miss Brawl because of SSE, not because of anything related to competitive.
        Very very few people say they miss brawl lol
            I liked subspace emissary a lot! Like the actual levels and collecting trophies with the trophy frisbee.  I thought that was so awesome. Pretty sad they didnt make it like that for this one but oh well. 
                Oh I definitely agree. Subspace was one of the best things to ever happen in smash

But, even with the vocal minority in this thread, brawl is widely not missed.

Melee will last forever. Brawl and smash 4 will mostly likely not
                    I feel that each Smash game has an aspect of it that it will be remembered for... Except Smash 4.

I mean, 64 was the original, the game that started it all

Melee was and still is a competitive giant and where the series really started picking up steam

Yes, Brawl undeniably had its problems, but Subspace was an extremely cool concept and I can name a number of people I personally know that went back to Brawl fairly recently just to play through that again

And Ultimate, is, well, Ultimate.

But what does Smash 4 have?  I mean, we don't know this yet but Ultimate seems to be a much better game than Smash 4.  Not to mention 4 didn't really have any memorable stuff besides the actual battles, Smash Tour was eh, very little single player content, etc...

I just feel that in a few years, Smash 4 is going to be the game that we all have forgotten/don't care about.  More so than Brawl, because even though many prefer Smash 4 (as do I) Brawl tried harder to make itself distinct.
                        This is exactly how I've felt since Ultimate was revealed. Maybe Smash 4 will be remembered for customs? Maybe? But every other game has a unique gameplay style (64, Melee) and/or great single-player content (Brawl), and Ultimate, as well as being the newest game, has everything Smash 4 had plus worthwhile single-player. 
                        I will remember it for the competitive scene, third party characters (Cloud and Ryu announcement made me cry), and the most functional online in the series (so far, let's see what Ultimate has).

Edit: also, first portable experience and amiibos (regardless of how we feel about them, they were a sucess from a Sales point of view).
                    Smash 4 only because it looks like its the basis of Ultimate otherwise I think it would last as long as Melee because of how tight it is. 
            There is  lot of them, even in this thread, saying Sm4sh is the worse entry in the series.

Omni, which is one of my favorite smash youtubers, went as far as saying that competitively, Sm4sh and Brawl were almost the same, which doesn't make sense IMO.
Woah, when did Mario Kart 9 come out?
    Now I want Scorpion in Mario Kart! Lol
        [Well then do I have a game for you! MK Armageddon had a kart racer mode included.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_boyufoODjI)
            This is fucking stupid and I love it so much!
    Mortal Kombat 9
Woah there. Sf4 is objectively better than Sf5
See also: every legend of Zelda game before the most recent release. 
[deleted]
    Interesting, I though AE was the most poralizing SFIV installment. Still, is the one who made me start playing it! Lol
We wont. It hasn't been like that and wont be like that for smash. That's also why brawl is dead and now smash 4 while melee is still alive.
When Smash Super Ultra Grand Slam Mega Battle Royale comes out all the games will pale in comparison.
    You thought 8 player smash was fun? Wait until you play **MMO smash!!!!**
the only problems i can think of would be lack of trophies and extra like the map maker and masterpieces.
I think it's less about more thought and care being put into it and more the fact that they're not splitting their development resources so much by developing two different versions of the game.

Smash Wii U was held back so much by Smash 3DS.
    Yep, I’ll always say this. I loved Smash 3DS, and I’ll never regret the time I spent playing it in high school in the hallway with friends. But Sakurai made Smash 3DS pretty much an entirely separate game that had to be made exactly like the Wii U game, which was limited by the power of the 3DS. No Ice Climbers, etc. I’m surprised that they included 8 player Smash since it wasn’t in the 3DS version.
    At the same time, Smash 3DS's stagelist and game modes were better in a lot of ways than Smash Wii U's. Smash Run > Smash Tour, 3DS Classic > Wii U Classic, and 3DS had a lot of fantastic stages.

I'm really happy Ultimate is bringing in a lot of Smash 3DS stages, because they deserve more time in the limelight (or rather, the lifelight).
        COLORS WEAVE INTO A SPIRE OF FLAMES
What have you seen that makes you think Ultimate's meta will be defensive? All the clips I have seem make it feel super offensive heavy.
Yes. From a software development standpoint, this is like people getting mad that Nintendo is making improvements on a previous project.

I could understand someone being annoyed that "improvements" are being sold as a brand new game, but their are more than enough new features added to justify it.
Brawl isn’t quite getting the “best game ever” treatment, but it is getting enough “my favorite smash” posts and loooads of praise for SSE. About every week here we get A post “i actually enjoyed SSE!” To the point where they’re dropping the “unpopular opinion:” disclaimer
    I always thought Brawl was far and away the worst one. Is that an uncommon opinion?
        Pretty much nobody says it was mechanically better as far as actual gameplay mechanics go. Everyone likes SSE though, and when people's say "I liked Brawl" that (and the stage editor) is what they mean. Then people confuse that with praise for mechanics for some reason.
            I will never say Brawl's mechanics were better than either Melee or Smash 4, and I do prefer Melee's single player adventure mode from a gameplay standpoint to SSE, but while I appreciate the ability to draw your own terrain, I missed Brawl's stage hazard options severely in its stage editor.  I literally could not re-create many of my favorite Brawl custom stages in Smash 4 because I didn't have the spikes, ladders, etc. I needed to make them.
        Not a horribly uncommon opinion but an opinion nonetheless. Having played through Smash 4 and having returned to melee, it does feel a bit clunky

To each their own really
        I think that's the common opinion, even though 64 is garbage
            64 might be garbage in terms of actual mechanics, but it has a lot of charm. A *whole* lot of charm.
            Hey man that’s my childhood your clocking in the face
            Huh? 64 is second best in mechanics after Melee. It's incredibly fun to watch, its combos are so good that it's the only game to feature a combo contest, and it's relatively balanced AFAIK. I don't think anyone says 64 is garbage. Pretty soon 64 tournaments will be bigger than Smash 4 tournaments. In 7 or 8 years 64 tournaments will be bigger than Ultimate tournaments. 
    >About every week here we get A post “i actually enjoyed SSE!” To the point where they’re dropping the “unpopular opinion:” disclaimer

The thing is people are simply tired of competitive Smash players glorifying Melee so much that most people simply upvote anything that praises Brawl, which was seen as a stark contrast to Melee. There's also the small but vocal people who actually do like SSE and will always upvote anything that praises something that really was universally hated when it came out.

Lastly, Brawl came out... almost a decade ago. We've been filled with enough younger gamers now who grew up on Brawl and likely have nostalgic memories of SSE that are clouding their opinions. You honestly see this with... LOTS of games most gamers hated in the past.

I see this with Super Paper Mario, Mario Sticker Star, SSBB, hell even Metroid: Other M. This is also true with non-Nintendo games like Final fantasy 13, Resident Evil 5, and Sonic 06. 

There really should be a term for this... Where people who hated games that were pretty definitively hated in the past are somehow replaced by a small but growing number of people who, for some reason, want to simply disagree with the overwhelming opinion at the time.
Uh

When did Brawl go through the last two phases? 
    Competitive players still hate Brawl, but you also get a lot of people talking about how great SSE was these days. 
        That tripping mechanic was a pain though :(
        so true. The vocal opinion was everyone hated SSE until talks of a new story mode surfaced and all of a sudden it was like WOW FINALLY... SSE was GREAT! typical internet 
        Yea, if you liked SSE (Which I did) there’s an argument that Brawl has the best single-player modes in the series. I prefer Melee’s but think Brawl was a close second.
        [deleted]
            Mostly I think people just miss single player content.
                And Coin launcher. I definitely miss coin launcher.
                    it was great until you needed those last 3 trophies for completion lol
                    Oh mannnn, I loved that game!  Much better than Smash 4's trophy rush, iirc.  (It's been so long since I had played either).
                    That coin launcher music was chill as hell too.
            Brawl is my favorite in the series hands down.

And thats not bullshit.

Now you have.
                I never played 4, but as someone who prefers to play Smash as a party game and not as a competitive fighter, I definitely prefer Brawl over Melee. More stages, more characters, and a stage creator? Yes please. 
                    > but as someone who prefers to play Smash as a party game and not as a competitive fighter

So like, 90% of people who play the game, including the development team?

Smash was always a party game, and Brawl was a natural evolution of that.  Zany items, crazy hazards, tripping, stage creation...so many random elements to act and react to while laughing/fighting/arguing/etc. with friends.  That's what Nintendo prefers to make and always have.

Then, as usual, a subset of the fanbase decide to take it too far and needed to prove their *LEETskillz* by counting the invincibility frames on Jiggly Puff's j.2S and began demanding recognition and next thing you know, Smash tournaments are being held and unlike *every* other competitive fighting game that uses the full scope of *all* its mechanics, Smash tourneys need to have items off, stage hazards off, assist trophies off, pokeballs off, every random element stripped away and most of the game's features and mechanics shut down just to force it to function under "competitive rules".

It's a shame Sakurai and Co. have to cater to that side of it; I wonder what Smash could have been if it *wasn't* hounded by people trying to make it Melee instead of letting it be what it's trying to be.

A good fighting game works on multiple levels. Sure, its fun to button mash with friends in, but having a viable competitive scene also helps give the series longevity and even extra exposure and free advertising for casual gamers. Brawl was fun as as a casual game, but for many players, that wasn't enough. They wanted a game that can also be a regular at EVO too. Keep in mind, Brawl was around the time that the Fighting game franchise was starting to see a resurgence with Street Fighter IV, and as eSports were becoming more and more popular, Brawl just looked tone deaf to a lot of people. 
                    Yea I agree, I just think melee is a broken mess with no balancing. I understand most of the love is because how fast it is but still.
                        If you think Melee is a broken mess with no balancing though, why do you like Brawl?

Really the only Smash which that doesn’t apply to is Smash 4, circa 2015, but Brawl was certainly the least balanced of the original three, and no less broken than the others.
                            This doesn’t go for everyone apparently, but I’ve experienced far less bugs and far less crazy broken combos other than meta knight.

I don’t play competitively so that’s probably why I feel it’s less broken, because every melee video I see is several characters being able to infinite combo, like ice climbers and fox and falco and crap like that.
                Prat Brawls
                Same actually. As a gamer who is bad at fighting games, I’ll never get into the competitive side. I can understand why the competitive players didn’t like it but I thought it was really fun and SSE was a really unique and entertaining campaign.
            SSE is one of the most important things to me for smash so brawl may stay my favorite 
            Personally I prefer the floatier gameplay of Brawl and Smash 4 is kinda similar but ruined some characters/stages and the AI for me. Also, no offline tournament mode?

Ultimate is looking good though, since it sounds like they fixed some of the problems I had with Sm4sh, but I haven't tried it yet.
                As far as I can tell it fixes pretty much every shortcoming of Sm4sh.
            Well let me change that for you.

I have played every smash game since the 64 one. In fact, the Nintendo 64 smash brothers was the first video game I ever played, period. That said, Brawl is the greatest of the series so far. It looks like this new one has a chance of changing that, but it's not out yet, so we'll just have to wait and see.

                    Brawl is surely the worst tournament game, but as a casual game it has more stages and fighters than melee, and better single player content than SSB4. 
                        as a casual game my friends and I will probably never stop playing melee just because thats what we grew up on. I think brawl's art style aged really badly; it looks horrible while melee looks ok and 64 has its goofy charm.

The single player content was a lot of fun but i also played that 11 years ago and i doubt i would have as much fun now lol
                    I think you forget that competitive players are a very loud, but very very tiny minority of the players of smash.

99% of players would look at you like you're speaking a different language as soon as you mention project M

Edit: words are hard 
                    Fun fact, the internet is full of people willing to share opinions that differ from the majority of people. They also speak loudly.

(I like Brawl too, but its because I really don't like multiplayer and Brawl had a shitload more to do/collect than any other Smash game has... till now? Weird that you don't see people like that at Smash competitions though, eh?)
                    Pretty much everyone I know thinks Brawl is the best, it’s more accessible than melee and it was on a great console that everyone had to play with friends.

I get the competitive scene doesn’t like Brawl but for casual players the multiplayer was really good, and the SSE was a thing, so we love it.

When my university hosts tournaments (remember this isn’t a competitive tournament, it’s to let people join in and have fun) it uses Brawl still
            Brawl is by far my 2nd favourite of the series, so I guess I'm one of the weird never seen anybody's.
            It's the most sold in the series and I've heard casuals say Brawl is the best bc subspace + really strong roster. 
            Brawl was my favorite so far because of the single player content which was far superior in comparison to previous and future titles.
            I literally have seen somebody talk about how great Brawl is in comparison to the other games.
            I liked brawl... 
            Brawl is the best.  

            [deleted]
                > It was a great step forward.

Casually, yes, Brawl was a brilliant game.  Competitively, it's horrible.  A random 1% chance of tripping every time you dash is stupid.  A character that can literally turn invisible and invincible for infinite amounts of time does not make for a good competitive game.  And if you think I'm exaggerating, [I'm not](https://www.ssbwiki.com/Infinite_Dimensional_Cape).  And that's far from the only competitive problem Brawl has, balance is another.  Brawl Ganondorf is considered the worst fighting game character ever, and Meta Knight is considered the most broken, overpowered Smash character ever.  Needless to say, it's nearly impossible for Ganon to beat MK.

Now casually, none of this matters.  You're just playing to have fun, so the balance issues, while noticeable, are excusable.  And for single player modes, it's definitely the best game due to Subspace Emissary alone. Nobody will argue with you there.

Brawl died because it's a flawed game competitively, and Smash 4 will die because there's no reason to play it over Ultimate.  But Melee lives on because it's still unique, and offers interactions that no other Smash game has been able to or even really tried to replicate.  Even though I much prefer playing Smash 4, I still prefer watching Melee due to  its intricate movement allowing for more competitive depth compared to the newer games.  

And it's not like Melee players haven't tried playing the newer games.  M2K played Brawl and Smash 4 at a high level, even being the best in Brawl at the time.  Mango tried Brawl.  Leffen, Armada, and tons of other Melee players tried Smash 4 when it first came out.  

I hope this helps you understand why good game != good competitive game necessarily.  Mario Party is a good game, but not a good competitive game.
                The Smash ball point is such a great point, I feel like I only just realized those started in Brawl, and what a great addition too
                    Assist Trophies also debuted in Brawl, which are amazing. 
                > competitive players don't like change and Brawl represents that Smash is not a static game.

When the changes make the game objectively bad from a competitive standpoint, yeah
                Ah yes here's the obligatory "Melee players don't change" trite. Nevermind the fact that people take shits on melee every few hours without actually understanding anything about it and its community. Many top Melee players including the infamously "hateful" Leffen have expressed interest in playing Ultimate. 


Also why are people so hellbent on getting melee players to "move on"? Nobody in here is telling people who love Brawl more to move on. When Mario Odyssey came out did that make anyone who plays the older Mario games someone who "doesn't like change"? Brawl was a wonderful game casually, but when you can literally just trip randomly at any time in a run, it's kind of hard to play seriously. Your interests may differ from mine, but can we stop the "Melee players hate anything not Melee because they're hateful showerless assholes" rhetoric?
        At the risk of sounding like a hipster, this annoys me a bit because I’ve been on that SSE from day 1. 
        What's SSE?
            Subspace Emissary, the story mode from Brawl.
        i mean you had people saying those positive things about SSE from the beginning

everyone thought the cutscenes were cool, and almost nobody liked the gameplay

though i guess the verdict shifted from more generally negative to generally positive, but i think that’s just bc more younger players are talking about it
        Competitive player who liked Brawl here.

But I was a dirty planking Pit main, too hipster to play MK and actually win anything.
        I see people saying that Brawl was underrated and that SSE was great.  


Those things are both wrong, but I see them said more often the farther we get from the game
            oi SSE was my juice when I was a kid, the boss battles were some of the most fun I've had with the series
                The boss battles and cutscenes were both nice, but I think people seem to have forgotten all the bits in between that where you have to slog through those dollar store Heartless was actually pretty damn awful.
    A lot of people on r/smashbros praise Brawl for basically everything other than it’s gameplay. It has a great OST, good roster, solid single player content, a lot of extra game modes that weren’t as good in Smash 4. The gameplay still sucks though.
    It's going through them approximately right now
    I'm starting to see more and more people saying Brawl was better than Smash 4.
        I'm amazed that so many people can be so very wrong.
            They're not, people just conflate different parts of the game.

Brawl had much better single player modes than 4, a better roster that melee. Just about everything about it was great... except the actual gameplay mechanics.

When people say "I really liked Brawl", 9 times out of 10 they're talking about Subspace Emissary, not competitive gameplay mechanics.
As far as I know most people still don't like brawl nearly as much as 4 or melee.

Brawl they intentionally made it uncompetitive. I think most casual players and smash fans like it, it was fun. But it was shitty Nintendo wanted you to play they way they wanted.

For what ever reason they didn't like it became a competitive fighter, and did things to try and stop it. Also brawl had straight up OP characters. 
The difference is that Brawl is mostly praised nowadays for its solid and abundant singleplayer content, whereas smash 4 is arguably one of the most lacking in singleplayer in the whole series. I’m not saying that this alone means that Smash 4 won’t be remembered fondly, but that if it is remembered fondly, it’ll be for completely different reasons than Brawl.
No Brawl is just actually bad.

It had a terrific single player, but the multiplayer was a massive step down from Melee in basically every single way. Also Metaknight was so broken and overpowered that he was banned from tournaments. 
lol, except Brawl is still looked down upon.
I still hate the core gameplay of brawl, the slow floaty style wasn't fun. Melee is probably tied with 4 for me. Melee challenges were awesome.
This is almost perfect, but let’s go has been way more polarising than you give it credit for. And I think there’s a sizeable contingent like me who think it’s, you know, fine.
The best part of this is that you can already see things beginning to change, with Black & White being considered the best game ever by many and X & Y being underrated gems.

Let's Go is a bit of an outlier though, since it's so different from what's generally expected from one of the main games.
    It feels like BW was hated by so many people for so long, I'm glad it's starting to get more appreciation!
        I've played ORAS, XY, DP and BW all in a couple years and not in order so the cycle is not really something I experienced first hand. Still, I love BW (and hate DP).
            DP will always be my favourite because it was my very first Pokémon game, and I actually got all the badges and beat the elite 4. XY was nice change in graphics but felt too iterative (not that all the others weren’t). ORAS was kind of the same deal. I actually played BW after all of those, and while the story felt pretty cool, it was hard to go back to those graphics and play style after XY and ORAS.
Let’s GO! is the best thing ever? Sure it’s been successful and I for one have been enjoying it too. But I’ve seen more hate for those games than I’ve seen praise.
    It really depends where you look. Among existing Pokémon fans it's really unpopular because of cutting out a lot of the depth, but among casual players, Let's Players etc. it's being hailed as a return to form after 20 years of decline.

Back when Brawl was first released it actually got a lot of the same stuff; a lot of casual fans claimed it was a huge improvement over Melee, partly because of the high amount of content, but also because they want Smash to be solely a party game.
        It definitely [depends](https://youtu.be/X2YfNeBxGLg) on where you [look](https://youtu.be/c66IR3qA5-w)
anybody saying gen 4 are the best games was literally born in like 2002 and you can't prove me wrong
    I'm pretty sure (and I say this as someone who thinks gen 4 is best gen) that whatever game most people currently entering their 20s grew up with is what's going to be considered the best gen. Right now gen 4 seems to be the most popular. A few years ago you'd be crucified if you didn't think gen 3 was the best. And recently I've started to see a lot of "BW/B2W2 are underrated gems" type posts. I'm willing to bet that within the next year or two gen 5 is going to be seen as the best gen.
        it's really more of the natural ebb and flow of the fanbase. when 3-4 came out, they were kinda panned by the community. that being said, the community was gens 1-2-heavy back then. as those people sortied because they became disinterested/disinvested in the series (for whatever reason that may be), the community gradually becomes filled with people who started 3-4. and of course, as those people leave you'll see more 5-6..... and so on.
        Am gen 4 fan, will stay gen 4 fan.
    You can make this same post about Super Mario Sunshine
    2000, try again kiddo
        same difference
    They're the second best, 1996.
    1998 here, old enough to have experienced it and gen 3 around the same time. Still think it's the best ;)
    2003, ahaha!
    I started on Red in the 90s and have played every gen (except Let's Go) and Platinum is still my favorite. Amazing tunes, a dope sprawling region that itself was the size of Kanto and Johto from G/S/C combined, and a fun villain to boot.

&#x200B;

I would be so hyped for the eventual remake if I wasn't thinking that Let's Go changed how that's going to play out.
    Diamond and Pearl were utter trash. Platinum improved alot, but Sinnoh still had some fundamental flaws. 

HGSS is fucking pure unadulterated awesome. 
People actually say that about XY? What?

I'm a huge Pokemon fan and it seems like the general consensus is that Sun and Moon are awful, but XY were pretty great, just not as good as Black/White.

A lot of "true" Pokemon fans seem to think Black/White were the last "good" Pokemon games, but there's still a lot of love for XY. Sun and Moon are universally panned for pandering and the horrible amount of handholding.
That's because it is built by the people that were young when those games came out. 10 years later those people are able to voice opinions loudly and they do so.

I remember when Windwaker came out and everyone was hating on it, now all you see is the love for that game. they tend to a lot of the time be people that were <10 when it came out.
People have shit on the Unova games for a while, but I’ve always liked them. The 2.5 D graphics and the animated sprites were a huge bonus for me, and while there were a few bad designs (Garbodor, Sawk/Throw, Clink, Amoongus) there’s a lot of good designs too (Zoroark, Chandelure, Haxorus, Reniculus). People get hung up on the negatives, but it also has some pretty good positives. I like Team Plasma and N since they actually had a pretty decent argument for what they were doing. The Aesthetic of the region was something I really loved. Black 2 and White 2 were really cool additions to the region as a sort of sequel, something that not a lot of other Pokémon games have done. There was an abundance of legendaries, but the core trio of Zekrom, Reshiram, and Kyrurem were good designs, and the Black Kyurem/White Kyurem lore was pretty cool too.
    Yeah I felt they poorest their heart and soul to make an as interesting as possible world and lure and then when it didn't sell well (even though pokemon has sold worse and worse each gen) they decided to scrap that idea and go hyper kid friendly and simplistic (whilst making the actual core of the game more complex)
        the series's sales have largely stabilized since the end of Pokemania after Gen 2. there are minute fluctuations in sales that can largely be attributed to timing. BW's lower sales can be attributed to coming so very late in the DS's lifespan.
        Pokémon isn't selling worse each gen. X and Y sold better than Black and White. 
Really? Talking about how good gen five is seems like it's been the popular opinion to have for quite a while now.
I hated them, just because of the Pokemon choices. Absolutely a matter of opinion, I'm sure they're well-loved in general.
The thing with Skyward Sword is that it's difficult to play without having a Wii (which is a total bitch to use on modern TVs) or a Wii U. (Enough said)

The only option otherwise is to use Dolphin and a Wii Motion Plus remote, which requires a pretty baller PC and a lot of technical jiggery.

This will either harm the game's reputation overall by making it so that people can't go back and re-evaluate it, or it'll give it a mistique, causing a certain degree of rose-tinted glasses. Tough to say. We'll see if it gets ported to Switch, I guess.

    That’s not the only issue with SS. The constant babying by Fi telling you how to solve every puzzle. The repetitive nature of the dumb collect the head time trials. And my two biggest reasons for disliking the game is a lack of towns/villages filled with side quests and NPCs and the lack of a true overworked except the empty sky. 
Skyward sword was a bad Zelda game and I will never change my opinion. 
Eh. I think the people that hated Windwaker back when it came out really just hated the animation style and never actually played it. 
Sure it’s happening with 4, but New Vegas never got called bad or anything during the 4 hype train.
I still don’t really care for Fallout 4. Got to the fight with the deathclaw and decided shortly after that the game just wasn’t my cup of tea.

As for someone who plays Pokemon competitively I think Gen 7 is by far one of the most fun to play with. Gen 6 had a lot of changes at once and were a total mess. Gen 7 had those changes more stabilized.
No. USM is worse than SM. It put a new story on the SM story and put no effort into adjusting it. Character arcs made no sense. It was a total mess. SM had problems, but the Story had a visable focus with evolving characters. USM spit on it.
    No Pokemon game has a good story. I know it's a controversial opinion, but truthfully, they don't. They'll have some well written characters for sure (N and Lillie come to mind), but overall the stories are always the exact same with minor differences. Always bland.

When I say USUM are good, and I do mean better than SM, it's purely from a non-story perspective. Gameplay, environments, "boss" battles, etc.
         The improvements were  minor. A few more minigames here a few harder battles there. And in my opinion SM had a good story. Not an innovative but a solid story with good characters. 
And the drop of quality storywise can't be saved by these few minor changes.
Are they worth it for people who didn't like Sun/Moon? My biggest gripe is definitely the excessive tutorial time, and the rest of the game I thought was decent, but it never really grabbed me.
    Well, it's basically the same game with, imo, better stuff. The boss fights are a lot better, especially the late game one. I think it has a better story too, although it's almost identical.

Thing is, is a lot of the "tutorials" remain. Now, personally, I don't really think they were tutorials. It was just a lot of cutscenes for the story. Obviously, the story isn't really great, so the cutscenes aren't enjoyable.

Still though, I think it's the best Pokemon game we've had so far.
Yeah, no one hated on Link Between Worlds, and no one is calling Triforce Heroes a hidden gem. There hasn't been a switch of opinion on the most recent Zelda games at all.
    For Zelda, it tends to be the major home console releases that are subject to the cycle. That said, there didn't seem to be a shift in opinion with BotW's release.
        You might see a very small amount of people call TP ot SS their favourite but no way did major opinion shift on them. Just when people disliked them, people were crying "the cycle!"
        There wasn't a shift in opinion when SS released, either.
It happened once with TWW, and that was it. If anything, the cycle is just "who's the louder part of the fanbase at this moment".
Wait how can you play race to the finish in 3DS?
Wtf Snape kills Dumbledore????
And now Ultimate just straight up spoils it with Shulk’s final smash
You must've had people to play with locally. Smash Tour is the least engaging single player mode in all of Smash. I'd take Smash Run or Subspace over Smash Tour any day of the week.
[deleted]
While it looks way better than Smash 4, I wouldn’t say they’re succeeding with competitive play. It’s still obvious that Sakarai has no idea why people love Melee so much. It’s not about having a lot of characters.
    According to impressions of a surprising number of Melee players, it seems they're succeeding down that road more than you think.

>It’s still obvious that Sakarai has no idea why people love Melee so much.

No, he knows exactly why people love Melee so much. It's very obvious though that he doesn't want to make that kind of game again.
    He knows why there is a die hard part of the competitive smash community that wants another melee. He’s said before in interviews that he doesn’t like how punishing it can be nor the exploits that came from some interactions.

He wants the series to go in the direction Smash 4 did for overall play with ultimate going further down that road.
Your right about Bayo and Cloud being extremely dominant, but Corrin was still had a fair ammount of presence in the top tiers.  
And subjective newcomers. Let's not forget how great Melee and Brawl's were. 
    What? Sm4sh had some *tight* newcomers. Mega Man, Little Mac, Shulk, Ryu, Cloud, Rosalina. That's good shit
        I'm not saying it doesn't, but Brawl had Sonic and Snake (groundbreaking at the time), and Melee had some of the biggest Nintendo characters added, like Peach and Bowser.
            To be fair, with each new game, the prospect of crowd-pleasing, jaw-dropping newcomers gets lower and lower because previous games have already included them.
        Little Mac and Cloud are the only two out of those that I enjoy playing as.
I cared little for *most* of the additions, I didn't say I didn't like any of them. Those two were by far the best newcomers imo.
    Fair fair. For me I gotta be honest I’m a GameCube kid and Sunshine was my shit so seeing Bowser Jr was really all I needed. Having Mewtwo back was huge. Ultimate is gonna be amazing.
        That Shadow Mario final smash made me so happy
From a competitive standpoint yeah, but the single player content is fun.
Who still gives a fuck about that shit  
It barely happens and it's barely of any consequence
    Objectively its just a bad mechanic that was ment to make the game more balanced. 

It didnt happen as often as some people say it did, but it happens enough to be noticable. It mess up your flow/combo and generally sucks. Ive died because of tripping and Ive seen plenty of people die because of it too. It doesnt feel satisfying to anyone.

When you trip, your opponent isnt getting lucky, your getting unlucky. There no counter mechanic that compensates for it. You cant accidentally have you attack do extra damage. 

All it does is add an unfair element of luck to the game, and in a fighting game thats pretty awful.

 
        It is objectively a bad mechanic and i'm happy with its removal  
But the effect is small enough to barely matter in the grand scheme of things and certainly isn't anywhere near enough to make Brawl the worst Smash game. 
            Your right, its not the reason. Brawls problems run a lot deeper than just one bad mechanic. 
    1-2% chance to instantly lose your life when you move is something a lot of people give a fuck about when they're tryna win.

Nothing like losing a few hundred $$$ because you tripped
        Competitive Smash is less than 10% of the game's enjoyability. That 10% might suck in Brawl, but you still have a whole bunch of single player modes and multiplayer parties with heavilly very customizable rulesets, etc...  
And besides, if you trip, it's not as if you're 100% guaranteed to lose your life. Even in a competitive match. Fuck, i dare say that less than half of trips immediately result in a lost stock. It's less a stun and more like an interruption
            competitive smash is less than 1% of the games enjoyability. The competitive scene is extremely small, and the mechanic itself was just a giant fuck you to the competitive community because sakurai didnt like them or something.

You're not guaranteed to lose your life but against good players it happens all the time, simply because once they get you where they want you to be they dont let you go until you're dead
    > barely of any consequence

Hardly. You trip anywhere near another player that's a stock gone.
    Lol no. Happens often and can cost you a stock easily. The most ridiculous idea ever implemented in Smash. 
Right? It wasn't necessarily a bad mode, but it sure as hell wasn't classic.
Yeah, people were really disappointed when Smash 4 didn’t have an Adventure mode, but the gameplay in Subspace Emissary wasn’t great.

The cutscenes were cool, but don’t really provide much after you’ve watched them a couple times.
The internet is not something you just dump something on.
    It's a series of tubes.
        Green, plumber-sized tubes right?
    Clearly not everyone got that memo. 💩
People dont give 64 enough credit (probably cause theyre too young ti have played it) but the combo contests and sick 0-to-deaths push it above Brawl and Smash 4.
    Also, Smash 64's sound effects are amazing!
0 to death Kirby combos feel incredible.
True, but there were certainly lots of glitches in melee, some that make certain characters unplayable (game and watch
    How is Mr. G&W glitched?
        His shield doesn't even cover himself so he can still be hit.
It was significantly better than anything Smash 4 put forward.

The cutscenes alone were worth it.
    Cut scenes were definitely very good and I didnt have a wii u so I didnt play that version of smash 4 much, I mostly played on 3ds
Brawl was my first so i'm biased, but Smash 4 got tiresome really fast. It's like it punished you for trying to do cool shit
    I remember bodying someone with Smash 4 Marth, than random Smash 4 dank happens, and I actually lose the match...it happens a lot...Smash 4 is unbelievably random and inconsistent in competitive play.

Melee and 64, I would feel I deserve the lost, but in Smash 4 there was genuinely bullshit going on that actually made me lose the match and feel genuinely cheated.
This is the internet. Everything is the best or worst of all time. Everything is either 5 stars or 1 star. Nuance is dead. Hyperbole is king. 
    This comment is the best or worst of all time.





Just joking around, I agree for the most part. The internet favours the extremes and the limit cases.
    Only a Sith deals in absolutes.
        But... that's an absolute.
            Thats intended
Well Smash is weird because many, many people will say that Melee is and will always be the best and that all are other smash games are downgrades.

&#x200B;
    Well, for a competitive player of top level, this is always going to be true. All around as a game is a completely different story.
        But what if I scream "nostalgia" at you?
Ya, it’s something that people seem to forget rather quickly. Granted, the staleness of Smash 4 never quite reached Brawl’s level, but towards the end here it’s definitely been noteworthy.
It's far from being "garbage", but it seems to me like Smash 4 is receiving more hate than usual because, unlike the first three Smash games, it doesn't offer much that would make someone come back to it after its successor comes out. 64 is the starting point of the series and still feels unlike any other Smash game, Melee's technical gameplay and tournament scene will keep it going for years to come, and Brawl has Subspace. Smash 4 doesn't really seem to offer anything right now that Ultimate or another Smash game doesn't have; the only things really unique to it are Smash Tour, its take on Classic Mode and Target Blast, none of which were very well-received, and Smash Run on 3DS, which is a game that's been largely ignored anyway since the release of the Wii U version. Ultimate is the closest thing to a straight upgrade over its predecessor on all fronts we've seen from a Smash game so far, and Smash 4's reputation will suffer for it. Maybe someday people will come back around to it, but I don't really think it's going to get the same level of pseudo-revival that Brawl has gotten in the last few years.
This. It always comes back to melee
    64 smash or nothin
        I prefer smash on the Atari 2600, thank you very much.

The Atari was the best Nintendo
    and there’s a reason for that
I think these are two different demographics. Most Melee fans never cared so much about Sm4sh, and they won't care about Ultimate either.
    [deleted]
        But will they play it competitively? I am not sure. Melee is so unique...
        It's not a stretch that the 10% who said 'no' make up the majority of the hardcore players who shit on all other Smash games.  'Silent majority' is a thing after all.
    Agreed, the people who always come back to Melee are hardcore Melee fans. A lot of casual fans (like myself, although I consider myself a “hardcore” fan of Smash, just not competitive ) still love Melee but, at least for me, I don’t always come back to Melee.
    Huge Melee Fan, super stoked for Ultimate.
    None of the other games have attempted to recreate what drew the melee players to the game in the first place. Melee was extremely fast paced and had a high skill floor and ceiling, which is great for serious gamers but made the game inaccessible to a large part of the target demographic. Nintendo has since dumbed the game down quite a bit, which is great for accessing that market but loses the small minority of very competitive players in the process.
    Ehhh, I was a huge Melee fan, hated Brawl but Sm4sh was easily my favorite smash game mehanics wise at least
Mortal Kombat 9
    Ah ok thanks, already feared I missed a new Mario Kart
    Michael Kors 9
Bayo was easy compared to Brawl MK, and people still say they miss Brawl, lol.

And I think we should expect at least 2014 Diddy situation.
    It’s not necessarily a matter of who was more oppressive, because the obvious answer is MK. Bayo was just so boring to watch and basically destroyed Smash 4’s competitive scene because no one wanted to watch Bayo all the time.

I’m positive we’ll have a broken ass character at launch but that’s what patches are for. Smash 4 was really close to being pretty well balanced but unfortunately was topped by Bayo.
        I agree with everything you said, but I don't think I made my point clear.

The problem is about perception. As the time goes on, people will give less weight to Sm4sh's flaws and more weight to Ultimate's.
        Some of these 0deaths in ult do scare me. It depends on how much of the cast they work on and whether it's possible to (S)DI out of them, but I'm not looking forward to stuff like luigi just fishing for a grab at 0% to do dthrow dair dair dthrow dair dair upB. That's just as bad as smash 4 bayo combos. If a lot of characters have 0deaths like that, I swear snake/links/pichu will literally be counter meta because they can put themselves at %s those combos don't work at.
            The difference is that while those 0deaths in Ult are scary, they're not autocombos. Like, different SDI patterns and techs in the right direction can get you off the trail, and the aggressor does need to be ready to improvise to keep it up.

What makes it different is the fact that it's not an autocombo. That was Bayo's and Brawl IC's and Melee IC's problems--once most characters got caught in witch twist or infinite chain grab or wobbling, you might as well put your controller down because you're hardly getting out of that one.
                Well, that puts me at ease then.
                    Yeah honestly seeing all these zero to deaths and such is getting me mad excited because I'm seeing so many options that look both challenging and rewarding to pull off. The engine for this game looks so damn clean.
                        It does look hype, I'm just hoping there will be some real depth to the combos. I was absolutely done with smash4 because, no matter what character you picked, mario players were *always* going to fish for a grab because dthrow uptilts is true until 40-60%. Luigi was always going to do some 0-60 shit. Bayo was always going to get the same 0-death shit.

0-deaths aren't too bad, as long as they require some variation and effort. In 4 you can watch a one minute YouTube video and you'll get 0-60 luigi shit. I'm hoping ult will require at least 5 minutes and a degree of memorization that exceeds that of a goldfish to get combos off.
        My friend thinks both Corrin and Cloud are pretty unbalanced whats your opinion on them?
            Cloud is OP in doubles but fine everywhere else, top 5 character for sure. Corrin is decent. Nothing too OP, nothing impossible to deal with outside of a couple of matchups(Ness for one) 
                Yeah my buddy is a great Cloud so that always got annoying haha. We dont talk much anymore though so I probably wont even be playing the new one with him 
    People miss Brawl because of SSE, not because of anything related to competitive.
    Very very few people say they miss brawl lol
        I liked subspace emissary a lot! Like the actual levels and collecting trophies with the trophy frisbee.  I thought that was so awesome. Pretty sad they didnt make it like that for this one but oh well. 
            Oh I definitely agree. Subspace was one of the best things to ever happen in smash

But, even with the vocal minority in this thread, brawl is widely not missed.

Melee will last forever. Brawl and smash 4 will mostly likely not
                I feel that each Smash game has an aspect of it that it will be remembered for... Except Smash 4.

I mean, 64 was the original, the game that started it all

Melee was and still is a competitive giant and where the series really started picking up steam

Yes, Brawl undeniably had its problems, but Subspace was an extremely cool concept and I can name a number of people I personally know that went back to Brawl fairly recently just to play through that again

And Ultimate, is, well, Ultimate.

But what does Smash 4 have?  I mean, we don't know this yet but Ultimate seems to be a much better game than Smash 4.  Not to mention 4 didn't really have any memorable stuff besides the actual battles, Smash Tour was eh, very little single player content, etc...

I just feel that in a few years, Smash 4 is going to be the game that we all have forgotten/don't care about.  More so than Brawl, because even though many prefer Smash 4 (as do I) Brawl tried harder to make itself distinct.
                    This is exactly how I've felt since Ultimate was revealed. Maybe Smash 4 will be remembered for customs? Maybe? But every other game has a unique gameplay style (64, Melee) and/or great single-player content (Brawl), and Ultimate, as well as being the newest game, has everything Smash 4 had plus worthwhile single-player. 
                    I will remember it for the competitive scene, third party characters (Cloud and Ryu announcement made me cry), and the most functional online in the series (so far, let's see what Ultimate has).

Edit: also, first portable experience and amiibos (regardless of how we feel about them, they were a sucess from a Sales point of view).
                Smash 4 only because it looks like its the basis of Ultimate otherwise I think it would last as long as Melee because of how tight it is. 
        There is  lot of them, even in this thread, saying Sm4sh is the worse entry in the series.

Omni, which is one of my favorite smash youtubers, went as far as saying that competitively, Sm4sh and Brawl were almost the same, which doesn't make sense IMO.
Now I want Scorpion in Mario Kart! Lol
    [Well then do I have a game for you! MK Armageddon had a kart racer mode included.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_boyufoODjI)
        This is fucking stupid and I love it so much!
Mortal Kombat 9
Interesting, I though AE was the most poralizing SFIV installment. Still, is the one who made me start playing it! Lol
You thought 8 player smash was fun? Wait until you play **MMO smash!!!!**
Yep, I’ll always say this. I loved Smash 3DS, and I’ll never regret the time I spent playing it in high school in the hallway with friends. But Sakurai made Smash 3DS pretty much an entirely separate game that had to be made exactly like the Wii U game, which was limited by the power of the 3DS. No Ice Climbers, etc. I’m surprised that they included 8 player Smash since it wasn’t in the 3DS version.
At the same time, Smash 3DS's stagelist and game modes were better in a lot of ways than Smash Wii U's. Smash Run > Smash Tour, 3DS Classic > Wii U Classic, and 3DS had a lot of fantastic stages.

I'm really happy Ultimate is bringing in a lot of Smash 3DS stages, because they deserve more time in the limelight (or rather, the lifelight).
    COLORS WEAVE INTO A SPIRE OF FLAMES
I always thought Brawl was far and away the worst one. Is that an uncommon opinion?
    Pretty much nobody says it was mechanically better as far as actual gameplay mechanics go. Everyone likes SSE though, and when people's say "I liked Brawl" that (and the stage editor) is what they mean. Then people confuse that with praise for mechanics for some reason.
        I will never say Brawl's mechanics were better than either Melee or Smash 4, and I do prefer Melee's single player adventure mode from a gameplay standpoint to SSE, but while I appreciate the ability to draw your own terrain, I missed Brawl's stage hazard options severely in its stage editor.  I literally could not re-create many of my favorite Brawl custom stages in Smash 4 because I didn't have the spikes, ladders, etc. I needed to make them.
    Not a horribly uncommon opinion but an opinion nonetheless. Having played through Smash 4 and having returned to melee, it does feel a bit clunky

To each their own really
    I think that's the common opinion, even though 64 is garbage
        64 might be garbage in terms of actual mechanics, but it has a lot of charm. A *whole* lot of charm.
        Hey man that’s my childhood your clocking in the face
        Huh? 64 is second best in mechanics after Melee. It's incredibly fun to watch, its combos are so good that it's the only game to feature a combo contest, and it's relatively balanced AFAIK. I don't think anyone says 64 is garbage. Pretty soon 64 tournaments will be bigger than Smash 4 tournaments. In 7 or 8 years 64 tournaments will be bigger than Ultimate tournaments. 
>About every week here we get A post “i actually enjoyed SSE!” To the point where they’re dropping the “unpopular opinion:” disclaimer

The thing is people are simply tired of competitive Smash players glorifying Melee so much that most people simply upvote anything that praises Brawl, which was seen as a stark contrast to Melee. There's also the small but vocal people who actually do like SSE and will always upvote anything that praises something that really was universally hated when it came out.

Lastly, Brawl came out... almost a decade ago. We've been filled with enough younger gamers now who grew up on Brawl and likely have nostalgic memories of SSE that are clouding their opinions. You honestly see this with... LOTS of games most gamers hated in the past.

I see this with Super Paper Mario, Mario Sticker Star, SSBB, hell even Metroid: Other M. This is also true with non-Nintendo games like Final fantasy 13, Resident Evil 5, and Sonic 06. 

There really should be a term for this... Where people who hated games that were pretty definitively hated in the past are somehow replaced by a small but growing number of people who, for some reason, want to simply disagree with the overwhelming opinion at the time.
Competitive players still hate Brawl, but you also get a lot of people talking about how great SSE was these days. 
    That tripping mechanic was a pain though :(
    so true. The vocal opinion was everyone hated SSE until talks of a new story mode surfaced and all of a sudden it was like WOW FINALLY... SSE was GREAT! typical internet 
    Yea, if you liked SSE (Which I did) there’s an argument that Brawl has the best single-player modes in the series. I prefer Melee’s but think Brawl was a close second.
    [deleted]
        Mostly I think people just miss single player content.
            And Coin launcher. I definitely miss coin launcher.
                it was great until you needed those last 3 trophies for completion lol
                Oh mannnn, I loved that game!  Much better than Smash 4's trophy rush, iirc.  (It's been so long since I had played either).
                That coin launcher music was chill as hell too.
        Brawl is my favorite in the series hands down.

And thats not bullshit.

Now you have.
            I never played 4, but as someone who prefers to play Smash as a party game and not as a competitive fighter, I definitely prefer Brawl over Melee. More stages, more characters, and a stage creator? Yes please. 
                > but as someone who prefers to play Smash as a party game and not as a competitive fighter

So like, 90% of people who play the game, including the development team?

Smash was always a party game, and Brawl was a natural evolution of that.  Zany items, crazy hazards, tripping, stage creation...so many random elements to act and react to while laughing/fighting/arguing/etc. with friends.  That's what Nintendo prefers to make and always have.

Then, as usual, a subset of the fanbase decide to take it too far and needed to prove their *LEETskillz* by counting the invincibility frames on Jiggly Puff's j.2S and began demanding recognition and next thing you know, Smash tournaments are being held and unlike *every* other competitive fighting game that uses the full scope of *all* its mechanics, Smash tourneys need to have items off, stage hazards off, assist trophies off, pokeballs off, every random element stripped away and most of the game's features and mechanics shut down just to force it to function under "competitive rules".

It's a shame Sakurai and Co. have to cater to that side of it; I wonder what Smash could have been if it *wasn't* hounded by people trying to make it Melee instead of letting it be what it's trying to be.
                    >It's a shame Sakurai and Co. have to cater to that side of it; I wonder what Smash could have been if it wasn't hounded by people trying to make it Melee instead of letting it be what it's trying to be.

A good fighting game works on multiple levels. Sure, its fun to button mash with friends in, but having a viable competitive scene also helps give the series longevity and even extra exposure and free advertising for casual gamers. Brawl was fun as as a casual game, but for many players, that wasn't enough. They wanted a game that can also be a regular at EVO too. Keep in mind, Brawl was around the time that the Fighting game franchise was starting to see a resurgence with Street Fighter IV, and as eSports were becoming more and more popular, Brawl just looked tone deaf to a lot of people. 
                Yea I agree, I just think melee is a broken mess with no balancing. I understand most of the love is because how fast it is but still.
                    If you think Melee is a broken mess with no balancing though, why do you like Brawl?

Really the only Smash which that doesn’t apply to is Smash 4, circa 2015, but Brawl was certainly the least balanced of the original three, and no less broken than the others.
                        This doesn’t go for everyone apparently, but I’ve experienced far less bugs and far less crazy broken combos other than meta knight.

I don’t play competitively so that’s probably why I feel it’s less broken, because every melee video I see is several characters being able to infinite combo, like ice climbers and fox and falco and crap like that.
            Prat Brawls
            Same actually. As a gamer who is bad at fighting games, I’ll never get into the competitive side. I can understand why the competitive players didn’t like it but I thought it was really fun and SSE was a really unique and entertaining campaign.
        SSE is one of the most important things to me for smash so brawl may stay my favorite 
        Personally I prefer the floatier gameplay of Brawl and Smash 4 is kinda similar but ruined some characters/stages and the AI for me. Also, no offline tournament mode?

Ultimate is looking good though, since it sounds like they fixed some of the problems I had with Sm4sh, but I haven't tried it yet.
            As far as I can tell it fixes pretty much every shortcoming of Sm4sh.
        Well let me change that for you.

I have played every smash game since the 64 one. In fact, the Nintendo 64 smash brothers was the first video game I ever played, period. That said, Brawl is the greatest of the series so far. It looks like this new one has a chance of changing that, but it's not out yet, so we'll just have to wait and see. 
            [deleted]
                Brawl is surely the worst tournament game, but as a casual game it has more stages and fighters than melee, and better single player content than SSB4. 
                    as a casual game my friends and I will probably never stop playing melee just because thats what we grew up on. I think brawl's art style aged really badly; it looks horrible while melee looks ok and 64 has its goofy charm.

The single player content was a lot of fun but i also played that 11 years ago and i doubt i would have as much fun now lol
                I think you forget that competitive players are a very loud, but very very tiny minority of the players of smash.

99% of players would look at you like you're speaking a different language as soon as you mention project M

Edit: words are hard 
                Fun fact, the internet is full of people willing to share opinions that differ from the majority of people. They also speak loudly.

(I like Brawl too, but its because I really don't like multiplayer and Brawl had a shitload more to do/collect than any other Smash game has... till now? Weird that you don't see people like that at Smash competitions though, eh?)
                Pretty much everyone I know thinks Brawl is the best, it’s more accessible than melee and it was on a great console that everyone had to play with friends.

I get the competitive scene doesn’t like Brawl but for casual players the multiplayer was really good, and the SSE was a thing, so we love it.

When my university hosts tournaments (remember this isn’t a competitive tournament, it’s to let people join in and have fun) it uses Brawl still
        Brawl is by far my 2nd favourite of the series, so I guess I'm one of the weird never seen anybody's.
        It's the most sold in the series and I've heard casuals say Brawl is the best bc subspace + really strong roster. 
        Brawl was my favorite so far because of the single player content which was far superior in comparison to previous and future titles.
        I literally have seen somebody talk about how great Brawl is in comparison to the other games.
        I liked brawl... 
        Brawl is the best.  

        [deleted]
            > It was a great step forward.

Casually, yes, Brawl was a brilliant game.  Competitively, it's horrible.  A random 1% chance of tripping every time you dash is stupid.  A character that can literally turn invisible and invincible for infinite amounts of time does not make for a good competitive game.  And if you think I'm exaggerating, [I'm not](https://www.ssbwiki.com/Infinite_Dimensional_Cape).  And that's far from the only competitive problem Brawl has, balance is another.  Brawl Ganondorf is considered the worst fighting game character ever, and Meta Knight is considered the most broken, overpowered Smash character ever.  Needless to say, it's nearly impossible for Ganon to beat MK.

Now casually, none of this matters.  You're just playing to have fun, so the balance issues, while noticeable, are excusable.  And for single player modes, it's definitely the best game due to Subspace Emissary alone. Nobody will argue with you there.

Brawl died because it's a flawed game competitively, and Smash 4 will die because there's no reason to play it over Ultimate.  But Melee lives on because it's still unique, and offers interactions that no other Smash game has been able to or even really tried to replicate.  Even though I much prefer playing Smash 4, I still prefer watching Melee due to  its intricate movement allowing for more competitive depth compared to the newer games.  

And it's not like Melee players haven't tried playing the newer games.  M2K played Brawl and Smash 4 at a high level, even being the best in Brawl at the time.  Mango tried Brawl.  Leffen, Armada, and tons of other Melee players tried Smash 4 when it first came out.  

I hope this helps you understand why good game != good competitive game necessarily.  Mario Party is a good game, but not a good competitive game.
            The Smash ball point is such a great point, I feel like I only just realized those started in Brawl, and what a great addition too
                Assist Trophies also debuted in Brawl, which are amazing. 
            > competitive players don't like change and Brawl represents that Smash is not a static game.

When the changes make the game objectively bad from a competitive standpoint, yeah
            Ah yes here's the obligatory "Melee players don't change" trite. Nevermind the fact that people take shits on melee every few hours without actually understanding anything about it and its community. Many top Melee players including the infamously "hateful" Leffen have expressed interest in playing Ultimate. 


Also why are people so hellbent on getting melee players to "move on"? Nobody in here is telling people who love Brawl more to move on. When Mario Odyssey came out did that make anyone who plays the older Mario games someone who "doesn't like change"? Brawl was a wonderful game casually, but when you can literally just trip randomly at any time in a run, it's kind of hard to play seriously. Your interests may differ from mine, but can we stop the "Melee players hate anything not Melee because they're hateful showerless assholes" rhetoric?
    At the risk of sounding like a hipster, this annoys me a bit because I’ve been on that SSE from day 1. 
    What's SSE?
        Subspace Emissary, the story mode from Brawl.
    i mean you had people saying those positive things about SSE from the beginning

everyone thought the cutscenes were cool, and almost nobody liked the gameplay

though i guess the verdict shifted from more generally negative to generally positive, but i think that’s just bc more younger players are talking about it
    Competitive player who liked Brawl here.

But I was a dirty planking Pit main, too hipster to play MK and actually win anything.
    I see people saying that Brawl was underrated and that SSE was great.  


Those things are both wrong, but I see them said more often the farther we get from the game
        oi SSE was my juice when I was a kid, the boss battles were some of the most fun I've had with the series
            The boss battles and cutscenes were both nice, but I think people seem to have forgotten all the bits in between that where you have to slog through those dollar store Heartless was actually pretty damn awful.
A lot of people on r/smashbros praise Brawl for basically everything other than it’s gameplay. It has a great OST, good roster, solid single player content, a lot of extra game modes that weren’t as good in Smash 4. The gameplay still sucks though.
It's going through them approximately right now
I'm starting to see more and more people saying Brawl was better than Smash 4.
    I'm amazed that so many people can be so very wrong.
        They're not, people just conflate different parts of the game.

Brawl had much better single player modes than 4, a better roster that melee. Just about everything about it was great... except the actual gameplay mechanics.

When people say "I really liked Brawl", 9 times out of 10 they're talking about Subspace Emissary, not competitive gameplay mechanics.
It feels like BW was hated by so many people for so long, I'm glad it's starting to get more appreciation!
    I've played ORAS, XY, DP and BW all in a couple years and not in order so the cycle is not really something I experienced first hand. Still, I love BW (and hate DP).
        DP will always be my favourite because it was my very first Pokémon game, and I actually got all the badges and beat the elite 4. XY was nice change in graphics but felt too iterative (not that all the others weren’t). ORAS was kind of the same deal. I actually played BW after all of those, and while the story felt pretty cool, it was hard to go back to those graphics and play style after XY and ORAS.
It really depends where you look. Among existing Pokémon fans it's really unpopular because of cutting out a lot of the depth, but among casual players, Let's Players etc. it's being hailed as a return to form after 20 years of decline.

Back when Brawl was first released it actually got a lot of the same stuff; a lot of casual fans claimed it was a huge improvement over Melee, partly because of the high amount of content, but also because they want Smash to be solely a party game.
    It definitely [depends](https://youtu.be/X2YfNeBxGLg) on where you [look](https://youtu.be/c66IR3qA5-w)
I'm pretty sure (and I say this as someone who thinks gen 4 is best gen) that whatever game most people currently entering their 20s grew up with is what's going to be considered the best gen. Right now gen 4 seems to be the most popular. A few years ago you'd be crucified if you didn't think gen 3 was the best. And recently I've started to see a lot of "BW/B2W2 are underrated gems" type posts. I'm willing to bet that within the next year or two gen 5 is going to be seen as the best gen.
    it's really more of the natural ebb and flow of the fanbase. when 3-4 came out, they were kinda panned by the community. that being said, the community was gens 1-2-heavy back then. as those people sortied because they became disinterested/disinvested in the series (for whatever reason that may be), the community gradually becomes filled with people who started 3-4. and of course, as those people leave you'll see more 5-6..... and so on.
    Am gen 4 fan, will stay gen 4 fan.
You can make this same post about Super Mario Sunshine
2000, try again kiddo
    same difference
They're the second best, 1996.
1998 here, old enough to have experienced it and gen 3 around the same time. Still think it's the best ;)
2003, ahaha!
I started on Red in the 90s and have played every gen (except Let's Go) and Platinum is still my favorite. Amazing tunes, a dope sprawling region that itself was the size of Kanto and Johto from G/S/C combined, and a fun villain to boot.

&#x200B;

I would be so hyped for the eventual remake if I wasn't thinking that Let's Go changed how that's going to play out.
Diamond and Pearl were utter trash. Platinum improved alot, but Sinnoh still had some fundamental flaws. 

HGSS is fucking pure unadulterated awesome. 
Yeah I felt they poorest their heart and soul to make an as interesting as possible world and lure and then when it didn't sell well (even though pokemon has sold worse and worse each gen) they decided to scrap that idea and go hyper kid friendly and simplistic (whilst making the actual core of the game more complex)
    the series's sales have largely stabilized since the end of Pokemania after Gen 2. there are minute fluctuations in sales that can largely be attributed to timing. BW's lower sales can be attributed to coming so very late in the DS's lifespan.
    Pokémon isn't selling worse each gen. X and Y sold better than Black and White. 
That’s not the only issue with SS. The constant babying by Fi telling you how to solve every puzzle. The repetitive nature of the dumb collect the head time trials. And my two biggest reasons for disliking the game is a lack of towns/villages filled with side quests and NPCs and the lack of a true overworked except the empty sky. 
No Pokemon game has a good story. I know it's a controversial opinion, but truthfully, they don't. They'll have some well written characters for sure (N and Lillie come to mind), but overall the stories are always the exact same with minor differences. Always bland.

When I say USUM are good, and I do mean better than SM, it's purely from a non-story perspective. Gameplay, environments, "boss" battles, etc.
     The improvements were  minor. A few more minigames here a few harder battles there. And in my opinion SM had a good story. Not an innovative but a solid story with good characters. 
And the drop of quality storywise can't be saved by these few minor changes.
Well, it's basically the same game with, imo, better stuff. The boss fights are a lot better, especially the late game one. I think it has a better story too, although it's almost identical.

Thing is, is a lot of the "tutorials" remain. Now, personally, I don't really think they were tutorials. It was just a lot of cutscenes for the story. Obviously, the story isn't really great, so the cutscenes aren't enjoyable.

Still though, I think it's the best Pokemon game we've had so far.
For Zelda, it tends to be the major home console releases that are subject to the cycle. That said, there didn't seem to be a shift in opinion with BotW's release.
    You might see a very small amount of people call TP ot SS their favourite but no way did major opinion shift on them. Just when people disliked them, people were crying "the cycle!"
    There wasn't a shift in opinion when SS released, either.
According to impressions of a surprising number of Melee players, it seems they're succeeding down that road more than you think.

>It’s still obvious that Sakarai has no idea why people love Melee so much.

No, he knows exactly why people love Melee so much. It's very obvious though that he doesn't want to make that kind of game again.
He knows why there is a die hard part of the competitive smash community that wants another melee. He’s said before in interviews that he doesn’t like how punishing it can be nor the exploits that came from some interactions.

He wants the series to go in the direction Smash 4 did for overall play with ultimate going further down that road.
What? Sm4sh had some *tight* newcomers. Mega Man, Little Mac, Shulk, Ryu, Cloud, Rosalina. That's good shit
    I'm not saying it doesn't, but Brawl had Sonic and Snake (groundbreaking at the time), and Melee had some of the biggest Nintendo characters added, like Peach and Bowser.
        To be fair, with each new game, the prospect of crowd-pleasing, jaw-dropping newcomers gets lower and lower because previous games have already included them.
    Little Mac and Cloud are the only two out of those that I enjoy playing as.
Fair fair. For me I gotta be honest I’m a GameCube kid and Sunshine was my shit so seeing Bowser Jr was really all I needed. Having Mewtwo back was huge. Ultimate is gonna be amazing.
    That Shadow Mario final smash made me so happy
Objectively its just a bad mechanic that was ment to make the game more balanced. 

It didnt happen as often as some people say it did, but it happens enough to be noticable. It mess up your flow/combo and generally sucks. Ive died because of tripping and Ive seen plenty of people die because of it too. It doesnt feel satisfying to anyone.

When you trip, your opponent isnt getting lucky, your getting unlucky. There no counter mechanic that compensates for it. You cant accidentally have you attack do extra damage. 

All it does is add an unfair element of luck to the game, and in a fighting game thats pretty awful.

 
    It is objectively a bad mechanic and i'm happy with its removal  
But the effect is small enough to barely matter in the grand scheme of things and certainly isn't anywhere near enough to make Brawl the worst Smash game. 
        Your right, its not the reason. Brawls problems run a lot deeper than just one bad mechanic. 
1-2% chance to instantly lose your life when you move is something a lot of people give a fuck about when they're tryna win.

Nothing like losing a few hundred $$$ because you tripped
    Competitive Smash is less than 10% of the game's enjoyability. That 10% might suck in Brawl, but you still have a whole bunch of single player modes and multiplayer parties with heavilly very customizable rulesets, etc...  
And besides, if you trip, it's not as if you're 100% guaranteed to lose your life. Even in a competitive match. Fuck, i dare say that less than half of trips immediately result in a lost stock. It's less a stun and more like an interruption
        competitive smash is less than 1% of the games enjoyability. The competitive scene is extremely small, and the mechanic itself was just a giant fuck you to the competitive community because sakurai didnt like them or something.

You're not guaranteed to lose your life but against good players it happens all the time, simply because once they get you where they want you to be they dont let you go until you're dead
> barely of any consequence

Hardly. You trip anywhere near another player that's a stock gone.
Lol no. Happens often and can cost you a stock easily. The most ridiculous idea ever implemented in Smash. 
It's a series of tubes.
    Green, plumber-sized tubes right?
Clearly not everyone got that memo. 💩
Also, Smash 64's sound effects are amazing!
How is Mr. G&W glitched?
    His shield doesn't even cover himself so he can still be hit.
Cut scenes were definitely very good and I didnt have a wii u so I didnt play that version of smash 4 much, I mostly played on 3ds
I remember bodying someone with Smash 4 Marth, than random Smash 4 dank happens, and I actually lose the match...it happens a lot...Smash 4 is unbelievably random and inconsistent in competitive play.

Melee and 64, I would feel I deserve the lost, but in Smash 4 there was genuinely bullshit going on that actually made me lose the match and feel genuinely cheated.
This comment is the best or worst of all time.





Just joking around, I agree for the most part. The internet favours the extremes and the limit cases.
Only a Sith deals in absolutes.
    But... that's an absolute.
        Thats intended
Well, for a competitive player of top level, this is always going to be true. All around as a game is a completely different story.
    But what if I scream "nostalgia" at you?
64 smash or nothin
    I prefer smash on the Atari 2600, thank you very much.

The Atari was the best Nintendo
and there’s a reason for that
[deleted]
    But will they play it competitively? I am not sure. Melee is so unique...
    It's not a stretch that the 10% who said 'no' make up the majority of the hardcore players who shit on all other Smash games.  'Silent majority' is a thing after all.
Agreed, the people who always come back to Melee are hardcore Melee fans. A lot of casual fans (like myself, although I consider myself a “hardcore” fan of Smash, just not competitive ) still love Melee but, at least for me, I don’t always come back to Melee.
Huge Melee Fan, super stoked for Ultimate.
None of the other games have attempted to recreate what drew the melee players to the game in the first place. Melee was extremely fast paced and had a high skill floor and ceiling, which is great for serious gamers but made the game inaccessible to a large part of the target demographic. Nintendo has since dumbed the game down quite a bit, which is great for accessing that market but loses the small minority of very competitive players in the process.
Ehhh, I was a huge Melee fan, hated Brawl but Sm4sh was easily my favorite smash game mehanics wise at least
Ah ok thanks, already feared I missed a new Mario Kart
Michael Kors 9
It’s not necessarily a matter of who was more oppressive, because the obvious answer is MK. Bayo was just so boring to watch and basically destroyed Smash 4’s competitive scene because no one wanted to watch Bayo all the time.

I’m positive we’ll have a broken ass character at launch but that’s what patches are for. Smash 4 was really close to being pretty well balanced but unfortunately was topped by Bayo.
    I agree with everything you said, but I don't think I made my point clear.

The problem is about perception. As the time goes on, people will give less weight to Sm4sh's flaws and more weight to Ultimate's.
    Some of these 0deaths in ult do scare me. It depends on how much of the cast they work on and whether it's possible to (S)DI out of them, but I'm not looking forward to stuff like luigi just fishing for a grab at 0% to do dthrow dair dair dthrow dair dair upB. That's just as bad as smash 4 bayo combos. If a lot of characters have 0deaths like that, I swear snake/links/pichu will literally be counter meta because they can put themselves at %s those combos don't work at.
        The difference is that while those 0deaths in Ult are scary, they're not autocombos. Like, different SDI patterns and techs in the right direction can get you off the trail, and the aggressor does need to be ready to improvise to keep it up.

What makes it different is the fact that it's not an autocombo. That was Bayo's and Brawl IC's and Melee IC's problems--once most characters got caught in witch twist or infinite chain grab or wobbling, you might as well put your controller down because you're hardly getting out of that one.
            Well, that puts me at ease then.
                Yeah honestly seeing all these zero to deaths and such is getting me mad excited because I'm seeing so many options that look both challenging and rewarding to pull off. The engine for this game looks so damn clean.
                    It does look hype, I'm just hoping there will be some real depth to the combos. I was absolutely done with smash4 because, no matter what character you picked, mario players were *always* going to fish for a grab because dthrow uptilts is true until 40-60%. Luigi was always going to do some 0-60 shit. Bayo was always going to get the same 0-death shit.

0-deaths aren't too bad, as long as they require some variation and effort. In 4 you can watch a one minute YouTube video and you'll get 0-60 luigi shit. I'm hoping ult will require at least 5 minutes and a degree of memorization that exceeds that of a goldfish to get combos off.
    My friend thinks both Corrin and Cloud are pretty unbalanced whats your opinion on them?
        Cloud is OP in doubles but fine everywhere else, top 5 character for sure. Corrin is decent. Nothing too OP, nothing impossible to deal with outside of a couple of matchups(Ness for one) 
            Yeah my buddy is a great Cloud so that always got annoying haha. We dont talk much anymore though so I probably wont even be playing the new one with him 
People miss Brawl because of SSE, not because of anything related to competitive.
Very very few people say they miss brawl lol
    I liked subspace emissary a lot! Like the actual levels and collecting trophies with the trophy frisbee.  I thought that was so awesome. Pretty sad they didnt make it like that for this one but oh well. 
        Oh I definitely agree. Subspace was one of the best things to ever happen in smash

But, even with the vocal minority in this thread, brawl is widely not missed.

Melee will last forever. Brawl and smash 4 will mostly likely not
            I feel that each Smash game has an aspect of it that it will be remembered for... Except Smash 4.

I mean, 64 was the original, the game that started it all

Melee was and still is a competitive giant and where the series really started picking up steam

Yes, Brawl undeniably had its problems, but Subspace was an extremely cool concept and I can name a number of people I personally know that went back to Brawl fairly recently just to play through that again

And Ultimate, is, well, Ultimate.

But what does Smash 4 have?  I mean, we don't know this yet but Ultimate seems to be a much better game than Smash 4.  Not to mention 4 didn't really have any memorable stuff besides the actual battles, Smash Tour was eh, very little single player content, etc...

I just feel that in a few years, Smash 4 is going to be the game that we all have forgotten/don't care about.  More so than Brawl, because even though many prefer Smash 4 (as do I) Brawl tried harder to make itself distinct.
                This is exactly how I've felt since Ultimate was revealed. Maybe Smash 4 will be remembered for customs? Maybe? But every other game has a unique gameplay style (64, Melee) and/or great single-player content (Brawl), and Ultimate, as well as being the newest game, has everything Smash 4 had plus worthwhile single-player. 
                I will remember it for the competitive scene, third party characters (Cloud and Ryu announcement made me cry), and the most functional online in the series (so far, let's see what Ultimate has).

Edit: also, first portable experience and amiibos (regardless of how we feel about them, they were a sucess from a Sales point of view).
            Smash 4 only because it looks like its the basis of Ultimate otherwise I think it would last as long as Melee because of how tight it is. 
    There is  lot of them, even in this thread, saying Sm4sh is the worse entry in the series.

Omni, which is one of my favorite smash youtubers, went as far as saying that competitively, Sm4sh and Brawl were almost the same, which doesn't make sense IMO.
[Well then do I have a game for you! MK Armageddon had a kart racer mode included.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_boyufoODjI)
    This is fucking stupid and I love it so much!
COLORS WEAVE INTO A SPIRE OF FLAMES
Pretty much nobody says it was mechanically better as far as actual gameplay mechanics go. Everyone likes SSE though, and when people's say "I liked Brawl" that (and the stage editor) is what they mean. Then people confuse that with praise for mechanics for some reason.
    I will never say Brawl's mechanics were better than either Melee or Smash 4, and I do prefer Melee's single player adventure mode from a gameplay standpoint to SSE, but while I appreciate the ability to draw your own terrain, I missed Brawl's stage hazard options severely in its stage editor.  I literally could not re-create many of my favorite Brawl custom stages in Smash 4 because I didn't have the spikes, ladders, etc. I needed to make them.
Not a horribly uncommon opinion but an opinion nonetheless. Having played through Smash 4 and having returned to melee, it does feel a bit clunky

To each their own really
I think that's the common opinion, even though 64 is garbage
    64 might be garbage in terms of actual mechanics, but it has a lot of charm. A *whole* lot of charm.
    Hey man that’s my childhood your clocking in the face
    Huh? 64 is second best in mechanics after Melee. It's incredibly fun to watch, its combos are so good that it's the only game to feature a combo contest, and it's relatively balanced AFAIK. I don't think anyone says 64 is garbage. Pretty soon 64 tournaments will be bigger than Smash 4 tournaments. In 7 or 8 years 64 tournaments will be bigger than Ultimate tournaments. 
That tripping mechanic was a pain though :(
so true. The vocal opinion was everyone hated SSE until talks of a new story mode surfaced and all of a sudden it was like WOW FINALLY... SSE was GREAT! typical internet 
Yea, if you liked SSE (Which I did) there’s an argument that Brawl has the best single-player modes in the series. I prefer Melee’s but think Brawl was a close second.
[deleted]
    Mostly I think people just miss single player content.
        And Coin launcher. I definitely miss coin launcher.
            it was great until you needed those last 3 trophies for completion lol
            Oh mannnn, I loved that game!  Much better than Smash 4's trophy rush, iirc.  (It's been so long since I had played either).
            That coin launcher music was chill as hell too.
    Brawl is my favorite in the series hands down.

And thats not bullshit.

Now you have.
        I never played 4, but as someone who prefers to play Smash as a party game and not as a competitive fighter, I definitely prefer Brawl over Melee. More stages, more characters, and a stage creator? Yes please. 
            > but as someone who prefers to play Smash as a party game and not as a competitive fighter

So like, 90% of people who play the game, including the development team?

Smash was always a party game, and Brawl was a natural evolution of that.  Zany items, crazy hazards, tripping, stage creation...so many random elements to act and react to while laughing/fighting/arguing/etc. with friends.  That's what Nintendo prefers to make and always have.

Then, as usual, a subset of the fanbase decide to take it too far and needed to prove their *LEETskillz* by counting the invincibility frames on Jiggly Puff's j.2S and began demanding recognition and next thing you know, Smash tournaments are being held and unlike *every* other competitive fighting game that uses the full scope of *all* its mechanics, Smash tourneys need to have items off, stage hazards off, assist trophies off, pokeballs off, every random element stripped away and most of the game's features and mechanics shut down just to force it to function under "competitive rules".

It's a shame Sakurai and Co. have to cater to that side of it; I wonder what Smash could have been if it *wasn't* hounded by people trying to make it Melee instead of letting it be what it's trying to be.
                >It's a shame Sakurai and Co. have to cater to that side of it; I wonder what Smash could have been if it wasn't hounded by people trying to make it Melee instead of letting it be what it's trying to be.

A good fighting game works on multiple levels. Sure, its fun to button mash with friends in, but having a viable competitive scene also helps give the series longevity and even extra exposure and free advertising for casual gamers. Brawl was fun as as a casual game, but for many players, that wasn't enough. They wanted a game that can also be a regular at EVO too. Keep in mind, Brawl was around the time that the Fighting game franchise was starting to see a resurgence with Street Fighter IV, and as eSports were becoming more and more popular, Brawl just looked tone deaf to a lot of people. 
            Yea I agree, I just think melee is a broken mess with no balancing. I understand most of the love is because how fast it is but still.
                If you think Melee is a broken mess with no balancing though, why do you like Brawl?

Really the only Smash which that doesn’t apply to is Smash 4, circa 2015, but Brawl was certainly the least balanced of the original three, and no less broken than the others.
                    This doesn’t go for everyone apparently, but I’ve experienced far less bugs and far less crazy broken combos other than meta knight.

I don’t play competitively so that’s probably why I feel it’s less broken, because every melee video I see is several characters being able to infinite combo, like ice climbers and fox and falco and crap like that.
        Prat Brawls
        Same actually. As a gamer who is bad at fighting games, I’ll never get into the competitive side. I can understand why the competitive players didn’t like it but I thought it was really fun and SSE was a really unique and entertaining campaign.
    SSE is one of the most important things to me for smash so brawl may stay my favorite 
    Personally I prefer the floatier gameplay of Brawl and Smash 4 is kinda similar but ruined some characters/stages and the AI for me. Also, no offline tournament mode?

Ultimate is looking good though, since it sounds like they fixed some of the problems I had with Sm4sh, but I haven't tried it yet.
        As far as I can tell it fixes pretty much every shortcoming of Sm4sh.
    Well let me change that for you.

I have played every smash game since the 64 one. In fact, the Nintendo 64 smash brothers was the first video game I ever played, period. That said, Brawl is the greatest of the series so far. It looks like this new one has a chance of changing that, but it's not out yet, so we'll just have to wait and see. 
        [deleted]
            Brawl is surely the worst tournament game, but as a casual game it has more stages and fighters than melee, and better single player content than SSB4. 
                as a casual game my friends and I will probably never stop playing melee just because thats what we grew up on. I think brawl's art style aged really badly; it looks horrible while melee looks ok and 64 has its goofy charm.

The single player content was a lot of fun but i also played that 11 years ago and i doubt i would have as much fun now lol
            I think you forget that competitive players are a very loud, but very very tiny minority of the players of smash.

99% of players would look at you like you're speaking a different language as soon as you mention project M

Edit: words are hard 
            Fun fact, the internet is full of people willing to share opinions that differ from the majority of people. They also speak loudly.

(I like Brawl too, but its because I really don't like multiplayer and Brawl had a shitload more to do/collect than any other Smash game has... till now? Weird that you don't see people like that at Smash competitions though, eh?)
            Pretty much everyone I know thinks Brawl is the best, it’s more accessible than melee and it was on a great console that everyone had to play with friends.

I get the competitive scene doesn’t like Brawl but for casual players the multiplayer was really good, and the SSE was a thing, so we love it.

When my university hosts tournaments (remember this isn’t a competitive tournament, it’s to let people join in and have fun) it uses Brawl still
    Brawl is by far my 2nd favourite of the series, so I guess I'm one of the weird never seen anybody's.
    It's the most sold in the series and I've heard casuals say Brawl is the best bc subspace + really strong roster. 
    Brawl was my favorite so far because of the single player content which was far superior in comparison to previous and future titles.
    I literally have seen somebody talk about how great Brawl is in comparison to the other games.
    I liked brawl... 
    Brawl is the best.  

    [deleted]
        > It was a great step forward.

Casually, yes, Brawl was a brilliant game.  Competitively, it's horrible.  A random 1% chance of tripping every time you dash is stupid.  A character that can literally turn invisible and invincible for infinite amounts of time does not make for a good competitive game.  And if you think I'm exaggerating, [I'm not](https://www.ssbwiki.com/Infinite_Dimensional_Cape).  And that's far from the only competitive problem Brawl has, balance is another.  Brawl Ganondorf is considered the worst fighting game character ever, and Meta Knight is considered the most broken, overpowered Smash character ever.  Needless to say, it's nearly impossible for Ganon to beat MK.

Now casually, none of this matters.  You're just playing to have fun, so the balance issues, while noticeable, are excusable.  And for single player modes, it's definitely the best game due to Subspace Emissary alone. Nobody will argue with you there.

Brawl died because it's a flawed game competitively, and Smash 4 will die because there's no reason to play it over Ultimate.  But Melee lives on because it's still unique, and offers interactions that no other Smash game has been able to or even really tried to replicate.  Even though I much prefer playing Smash 4, I still prefer watching Melee due to  its intricate movement allowing for more competitive depth compared to the newer games.  

And it's not like Melee players haven't tried playing the newer games.  M2K played Brawl and Smash 4 at a high level, even being the best in Brawl at the time.  Mango tried Brawl.  Leffen, Armada, and tons of other Melee players tried Smash 4 when it first came out.  

I hope this helps you understand why good game != good competitive game necessarily.  Mario Party is a good game, but not a good competitive game.
        The Smash ball point is such a great point, I feel like I only just realized those started in Brawl, and what a great addition too
            Assist Trophies also debuted in Brawl, which are amazing. 
        > competitive players don't like change and Brawl represents that Smash is not a static game.

When the changes make the game objectively bad from a competitive standpoint, yeah
        Ah yes here's the obligatory "Melee players don't change" trite. Nevermind the fact that people take shits on melee every few hours without actually understanding anything about it and its community. Many top Melee players including the infamously "hateful" Leffen have expressed interest in playing Ultimate. 


Also why are people so hellbent on getting melee players to "move on"? Nobody in here is telling people who love Brawl more to move on. When Mario Odyssey came out did that make anyone who plays the older Mario games someone who "doesn't like change"? Brawl was a wonderful game casually, but when you can literally just trip randomly at any time in a run, it's kind of hard to play seriously. Your interests may differ from mine, but can we stop the "Melee players hate anything not Melee because they're hateful showerless assholes" rhetoric?
At the risk of sounding like a hipster, this annoys me a bit because I’ve been on that SSE from day 1. 
What's SSE?
    Subspace Emissary, the story mode from Brawl.
i mean you had people saying those positive things about SSE from the beginning

everyone thought the cutscenes were cool, and almost nobody liked the gameplay

though i guess the verdict shifted from more generally negative to generally positive, but i think that’s just bc more younger players are talking about it
Competitive player who liked Brawl here.

But I was a dirty planking Pit main, too hipster to play MK and actually win anything.
I see people saying that Brawl was underrated and that SSE was great.  


Those things are both wrong, but I see them said more often the farther we get from the game
    oi SSE was my juice when I was a kid, the boss battles were some of the most fun I've had with the series
        The boss battles and cutscenes were both nice, but I think people seem to have forgotten all the bits in between that where you have to slog through those dollar store Heartless was actually pretty damn awful.
I'm amazed that so many people can be so very wrong.
    They're not, people just conflate different parts of the game.

Brawl had much better single player modes than 4, a better roster that melee. Just about everything about it was great... except the actual gameplay mechanics.

When people say "I really liked Brawl", 9 times out of 10 they're talking about Subspace Emissary, not competitive gameplay mechanics.
I've played ORAS, XY, DP and BW all in a couple years and not in order so the cycle is not really something I experienced first hand. Still, I love BW (and hate DP).
    DP will always be my favourite because it was my very first Pokémon game, and I actually got all the badges and beat the elite 4. XY was nice change in graphics but felt too iterative (not that all the others weren’t). ORAS was kind of the same deal. I actually played BW after all of those, and while the story felt pretty cool, it was hard to go back to those graphics and play style after XY and ORAS.
It definitely [depends](https://youtu.be/X2YfNeBxGLg) on where you [look](https://youtu.be/c66IR3qA5-w)
it's really more of the natural ebb and flow of the fanbase. when 3-4 came out, they were kinda panned by the community. that being said, the community was gens 1-2-heavy back then. as those people sortied because they became disinterested/disinvested in the series (for whatever reason that may be), the community gradually becomes filled with people who started 3-4. and of course, as those people leave you'll see more 5-6..... and so on.
Am gen 4 fan, will stay gen 4 fan.
same difference
the series's sales have largely stabilized since the end of Pokemania after Gen 2. there are minute fluctuations in sales that can largely be attributed to timing. BW's lower sales can be attributed to coming so very late in the DS's lifespan.
Pokémon isn't selling worse each gen. X and Y sold better than Black and White. 
 The improvements were  minor. A few more minigames here a few harder battles there. And in my opinion SM had a good story. Not an innovative but a solid story with good characters. 
And the drop of quality storywise can't be saved by these few minor changes.
You might see a very small amount of people call TP ot SS their favourite but no way did major opinion shift on them. Just when people disliked them, people were crying "the cycle!"
There wasn't a shift in opinion when SS released, either.
I'm not saying it doesn't, but Brawl had Sonic and Snake (groundbreaking at the time), and Melee had some of the biggest Nintendo characters added, like Peach and Bowser.
    To be fair, with each new game, the prospect of crowd-pleasing, jaw-dropping newcomers gets lower and lower because previous games have already included them.
Little Mac and Cloud are the only two out of those that I enjoy playing as.
That Shadow Mario final smash made me so happy
It is objectively a bad mechanic and i'm happy with its removal  
But the effect is small enough to barely matter in the grand scheme of things and certainly isn't anywhere near enough to make Brawl the worst Smash game. 
    Your right, its not the reason. Brawls problems run a lot deeper than just one bad mechanic. 
Competitive Smash is less than 10% of the game's enjoyability. That 10% might suck in Brawl, but you still have a whole bunch of single player modes and multiplayer parties with heavilly very customizable rulesets, etc...  
And besides, if you trip, it's not as if you're 100% guaranteed to lose your life. Even in a competitive match. Fuck, i dare say that less than half of trips immediately result in a lost stock. It's less a stun and more like an interruption
    competitive smash is less than 1% of the games enjoyability. The competitive scene is extremely small, and the mechanic itself was just a giant fuck you to the competitive community because sakurai didnt like them or something.

You're not guaranteed to lose your life but against good players it happens all the time, simply because once they get you where they want you to be they dont let you go until you're dead

        Well, that puts me at ease then.
            Yeah honestly seeing all these zero to deaths and such is getting me mad excited because I'm seeing so many options that look both challenging and rewarding to pull off. The engine for this game looks so damn clean.
                It does look hype, I'm just hoping there will be some real depth to the combos. I was absolutely done with smash4 because, no matter what character you picked, mario players were *always* going to fish for a grab because dthrow uptilts is true until 40-60%. Luigi was always going to do some 0-60 shit. Bayo was always going to get the same 0-death shit.

0-deaths aren't too bad, as long as they require some variation and effort. In 4 you can watch a one minute YouTube video and you'll get 0-60 luigi shit. I'm hoping ult will require at least 5 minutes and a degree of memorization that exceeds that of a goldfish to get combos off.
My friend thinks both Corrin and Cloud are pretty unbalanced whats your opinion on them?
    Cloud is OP in doubles but fine everywhere else, top 5 character for sure. Corrin is decent. Nothing too OP, nothing impossible to deal with outside of a couple of matchups(Ness for one) 
        Yeah my buddy is a great Cloud so that always got annoying haha. We dont talk much anymore though so I probably wont even be playing the new one with him 
I liked subspace emissary a lot! Like the actual levels and collecting trophies with the trophy frisbee.  I thought that was so awesome. Pretty sad they didnt make it like that for this one but oh well. 
    Oh I definitely agree. Subspace was one of the best things to ever happen in smash

But, even with the vocal minority in this thread, brawl is widely not missed.

Melee will last forever. Brawl and smash 4 will mostly likely not
        I feel that each Smash game has an aspect of it that it will be remembered for... Except Smash 4.

I mean, 64 was the original, the game that started it all

Melee was and still is a competitive giant and where the series really started picking up steam

Yes, Brawl undeniably had its problems, but Subspace was an extremely cool concept and I can name a number of people I personally know that went back to Brawl fairly recently just to play through that again

And Ultimate, is, well, Ultimate.

But what does Smash 4 have?  I mean, we don't know this yet but Ultimate seems to be a much better game than Smash 4.  Not to mention 4 didn't really have any memorable stuff besides the actual battles, Smash Tour was eh, very little single player content, etc...

I just feel that in a few years, Smash 4 is going to be the game that we all have forgotten/don't care about.  More so than Brawl, because even though many prefer Smash 4 (as do I) Brawl tried harder to make itself distinct.
            This is exactly how I've felt since Ultimate was revealed. Maybe Smash 4 will be remembered for customs? Maybe? But every other game has a unique gameplay style (64, Melee) and/or great single-player content (Brawl), and Ultimate, as well as being the newest game, has everything Smash 4 had plus worthwhile single-player. 
            I will remember it for the competitive scene, third party characters (Cloud and Ryu announcement made me cry), and the most functional online in the series (so far, let's see what Ultimate has).

Edit: also, first portable experience and amiibos (regardless of how we feel about them, they were a sucess from a Sales point of view).
        Smash 4 only because it looks like its the basis of Ultimate otherwise I think it would last as long as Melee because of how tight it is. 
There is  lot of them, even in this thread, saying Sm4sh is the worse entry in the series.

Omni, which is one of my favorite smash youtubers, went as far as saying that competitively, Sm4sh and Brawl were almost the same, which doesn't make sense IMO.
This is fucking stupid and I love it so much!
I will never say Brawl's mechanics were better than either Melee or Smash 4, and I do prefer Melee's single player adventure mode from a gameplay standpoint to SSE, but while I appreciate the ability to draw your own terrain, I missed Brawl's stage hazard options severely in its stage editor.  I literally could not re-create many of my favorite Brawl custom stages in Smash 4 because I didn't have the spikes, ladders, etc. I needed to make them.
64 might be garbage in terms of actual mechanics, but it has a lot of charm. A *whole* lot of charm.
Hey man that’s my childhood your clocking in the face
Huh? 64 is second best in mechanics after Melee. It's incredibly fun to watch, its combos are so good that it's the only game to feature a combo contest, and it's relatively balanced AFAIK. I don't think anyone says 64 is garbage. Pretty soon 64 tournaments will be bigger than Smash 4 tournaments. In 7 or 8 years 64 tournaments will be bigger than Ultimate tournaments. 
Mostly I think people just miss single player content.
    And Coin launcher. I definitely miss coin launcher.
        it was great until you needed those last 3 trophies for completion lol
        Oh mannnn, I loved that game!  Much better than Smash 4's trophy rush, iirc.  (It's been so long since I had played either).
        That coin launcher music was chill as hell too.
Brawl is my favorite in the series hands down.

And thats not bullshit.

Now you have.
    I never played 4, but as someone who prefers to play Smash as a party game and not as a competitive fighter, I definitely prefer Brawl over Melee. More stages, more characters, and a stage creator? Yes please. 
        > but as someone who prefers to play Smash as a party game and not as a competitive fighter

So like, 90% of people who play the game, including the development team?

Smash was always a party game, and Brawl was a natural evolution of that.  Zany items, crazy hazards, tripping, stage creation...so many random elements to act and react to while laughing/fighting/arguing/etc. with friends.  That's what Nintendo prefers to make and always have.

Then, as usual, a subset of the fanbase decide to take it too far and needed to prove their *LEETskillz* by counting the invincibility frames on Jiggly Puff's j.2S and began demanding recognition and next thing you know, Smash tournaments are being held and unlike *every* other competitive fighting game that uses the full scope of *all* its mechanics, Smash tourneys need to have items off, stage hazards off, assist trophies off, pokeballs off, every random element stripped away and most of the game's features and mechanics shut down just to force it to function under "competitive rules".

It's a shame Sakurai and Co. have to cater to that side of it; I wonder what Smash could have been if it *wasn't* hounded by people trying to make it Melee instead of letting it be what it's trying to be.
            >It's a shame Sakurai and Co. have to cater to that side of it; I wonder what Smash could have been if it wasn't hounded by people trying to make it Melee instead of letting it be what it's trying to be.

A good fighting game works on multiple levels. Sure, its fun to button mash with friends in, but having a viable competitive scene also helps give the series longevity and even extra exposure and free advertising for casual gamers. Brawl was fun as as a casual game, but for many players, that wasn't enough. They wanted a game that can also be a regular at EVO too. Keep in mind, Brawl was around the time that the Fighting game franchise was starting to see a resurgence with Street Fighter IV, and as eSports were becoming more and more popular, Brawl just looked tone deaf to a lot of people. 
        Yea I agree, I just think melee is a broken mess with no balancing. I understand most of the love is because how fast it is but still.
            If you think Melee is a broken mess with no balancing though, why do you like Brawl?

Really the only Smash which that doesn’t apply to is Smash 4, circa 2015, but Brawl was certainly the least balanced of the original three, and no less broken than the others.
                This doesn’t go for everyone apparently, but I’ve experienced far less bugs and far less crazy broken combos other than meta knight.

I don’t play competitively so that’s probably why I feel it’s less broken, because every melee video I see is several characters being able to infinite combo, like ice climbers and fox and falco and crap like that.
    Prat Brawls
    Same actually. As a gamer who is bad at fighting games, I’ll never get into the competitive side. I can understand why the competitive players didn’t like it but I thought it was really fun and SSE was a really unique and entertaining campaign.
SSE is one of the most important things to me for smash so brawl may stay my favorite 
Personally I prefer the floatier gameplay of Brawl and Smash 4 is kinda similar but ruined some characters/stages and the AI for me. Also, no offline tournament mode?

Ultimate is looking good though, since it sounds like they fixed some of the problems I had with Sm4sh, but I haven't tried it yet.
    As far as I can tell it fixes pretty much every shortcoming of Sm4sh.
Well let me change that for you.

I have played every smash game since the 64 one. In fact, the Nintendo 64 smash brothers was the first video game I ever played, period. That said, Brawl is the greatest of the series so far. It looks like this new one has a chance of changing that, but it's not out yet, so we'll just have to wait and see. 
    [deleted]
        Brawl is surely the worst tournament game, but as a casual game it has more stages and fighters than melee, and better single player content than SSB4. 
            as a casual game my friends and I will probably never stop playing melee just because thats what we grew up on. I think brawl's art style aged really badly; it looks horrible while melee looks ok and 64 has its goofy charm.

The single player content was a lot of fun but i also played that 11 years ago and i doubt i would have as much fun now lol
        I think you forget that competitive players are a very loud, but very very tiny minority of the players of smash.

99% of players would look at you like you're speaking a different language as soon as you mention project M

Edit: words are hard 
        Fun fact, the internet is full of people willing to share opinions that differ from the majority of people. They also speak loudly.

(I like Brawl too, but its because I really don't like multiplayer and Brawl had a shitload more to do/collect than any other Smash game has... till now? Weird that you don't see people like that at Smash competitions though, eh?)
        Pretty much everyone I know thinks Brawl is the best, it’s more accessible than melee and it was on a great console that everyone had to play with friends.

I get the competitive scene doesn’t like Brawl but for casual players the multiplayer was really good, and the SSE was a thing, so we love it.

When my university hosts tournaments (remember this isn’t a competitive tournament, it’s to let people join in and have fun) it uses Brawl still
Brawl is by far my 2nd favourite of the series, so I guess I'm one of the weird never seen anybody's.
It's the most sold in the series and I've heard casuals say Brawl is the best bc subspace + really strong roster. 
Brawl was my favorite so far because of the single player content which was far superior in comparison to previous and future titles.
I literally have seen somebody talk about how great Brawl is in comparison to the other games.
I liked brawl... 
Brawl is the best.  

[deleted]
    > It was a great step forward.

Casually, yes, Brawl was a brilliant game.  Competitively, it's horrible.  A random 1% chance of tripping every time you dash is stupid.  A character that can literally turn invisible and invincible for infinite amounts of time does not make for a good competitive game.  And if you think I'm exaggerating, [I'm not](https://www.ssbwiki.com/Infinite_Dimensional_Cape).  And that's far from the only competitive problem Brawl has, balance is another.  Brawl Ganondorf is considered the worst fighting game character ever, and Meta Knight is considered the most broken, overpowered Smash character ever.  Needless to say, it's nearly impossible for Ganon to beat MK.

Now casually, none of this matters.  You're just playing to have fun, so the balance issues, while noticeable, are excusable.  And for single player modes, it's definitely the best game due to Subspace Emissary alone. Nobody will argue with you there.

Brawl died because it's a flawed game competitively, and Smash 4 will die because there's no reason to play it over Ultimate.  But Melee lives on because it's still unique, and offers interactions that no other Smash game has been able to or even really tried to replicate.  Even though I much prefer playing Smash 4, I still prefer watching Melee due to  its intricate movement allowing for more competitive depth compared to the newer games.  

And it's not like Melee players haven't tried playing the newer games.  M2K played Brawl and Smash 4 at a high level, even being the best in Brawl at the time.  Mango tried Brawl.  Leffen, Armada, and tons of other Melee players tried Smash 4 when it first came out.  

I hope this helps you understand why good game != good competitive game necessarily.  Mario Party is a good game, but not a good competitive game.
    The Smash ball point is such a great point, I feel like I only just realized those started in Brawl, and what a great addition too
        Assist Trophies also debuted in Brawl, which are amazing. 
    > competitive players don't like change and Brawl represents that Smash is not a static game.

When the changes make the game objectively bad from a competitive standpoint, yeah
    Ah yes here's the obligatory "Melee players don't change" trite. Nevermind the fact that people take shits on melee every few hours without actually understanding anything about it and its community. Many top Melee players including the infamously "hateful" Leffen have expressed interest in playing Ultimate. 


Also why are people so hellbent on getting melee players to "move on"? Nobody in here is telling people who love Brawl more to move on. When Mario Odyssey came out did that make anyone who plays the older Mario games someone who "doesn't like change"? Brawl was a wonderful game casually, but when you can literally just trip randomly at any time in a run, it's kind of hard to play seriously. Your interests may differ from mine, but can we stop the "Melee players hate anything not Melee because they're hateful showerless assholes" rhetoric?
Subspace Emissary, the story mode from Brawl.
oi SSE was my juice when I was a kid, the boss battles were some of the most fun I've had with the series
    The boss battles and cutscenes were both nice, but I think people seem to have forgotten all the bits in between that where you have to slog through those dollar store Heartless was actually pretty damn awful.
They're not, people just conflate different parts of the game.

Brawl had much better single player modes than 4, a better roster that melee. Just about everything about it was great... except the actual gameplay mechanics.

When people say "I really liked Brawl", 9 times out of 10 they're talking about Subspace Emissary, not competitive gameplay mechanics.
DP will always be my favourite because it was my very first Pokémon game, and I actually got all the badges and beat the elite 4. XY was nice change in graphics but felt too iterative (not that all the others weren’t). ORAS was kind of the same deal. I actually played BW after all of those, and while the story felt pretty cool, it was hard to go back to those graphics and play style after XY and ORAS.
To be fair, with each new game, the prospect of crowd-pleasing, jaw-dropping newcomers gets lower and lower because previous games have already included them.
Your right, its not the reason. Brawls problems run a lot deeper than just one bad mechanic. 
competitive smash is less than 1% of the games enjoyability. The competitive scene is extremely small, and the mechanic itself was just a giant fuck you to the competitive community because sakurai didnt like them or something.

You're not guaranteed to lose your life but against good players it happens all the time, simply because once they get you where they want you to be they dont let you go until you're dead
Thats intended
The difference is that while those 0deaths in Ult are scary, they're not autocombos. Like, different SDI patterns and techs in the right direction can get you off the trail, and the aggressor does need to be ready to improvise to keep it up.

What makes it different is the fact that it's not an autocombo. That was Bayo's and Brawl IC's and Melee IC's problems--once most characters got caught in witch twist or infinite chain grab or wobbling, you might as well put your controller down because you're hardly getting out of that one.
    Well, that puts me at ease then.
        Yeah honestly seeing all these zero to deaths and such is getting me mad excited because I'm seeing so many options that look both challenging and rewarding to pull off. The engine for this game looks so damn clean.
            It does look hype, I'm just hoping there will be some real depth to the combos. I was absolutely done with smash4 because, no matter what character you picked, mario players were *always* going to fish for a grab because dthrow uptilts is true until 40-60%. Luigi was always going to do some 0-60 shit. Bayo was always going to get the same 0-death shit.

0-deaths aren't too bad, as long as they require some variation and effort. In 4 you can watch a one minute YouTube video and you'll get 0-60 luigi shit. I'm hoping ult will require at least 5 minutes and a degree of memorization that exceeds that of a goldfish to get combos off.

Then, as usual, a subset of the fanbase decide to take it too far and needed to prove their *LEETskillz* by counting the invincibility frames on Jiggly Puff's j.2S and began demanding recognition and next thing you know, Smash tournaments are being held and unlike *every* other competitive fighting game that uses the full scope of *all* its mechanics, Smash tourneys need to have items off, stage hazards off, assist trophies off, pokeballs off, every random element stripped away and most of the game's features and mechanics shut down just to force it to function under "competitive rules".

It's a shame Sakurai and Co. have to cater to that side of it; I wonder what Smash could have been if it *wasn't* hounded by people trying to make it Melee instead of letting it be what it's trying to be.

A good fighting game works on multiple levels. Sure, its fun to button mash with friends in, but having a viable competitive scene also helps give the series longevity and even extra exposure and free advertising for casual gamers. Brawl was fun as as a casual game, but for many players, that wasn't enough. They wanted a game that can also be a regular at EVO too. Keep in mind, Brawl was around the time that the Fighting game franchise was starting to see a resurgence with Street Fighter IV, and as eSports were becoming more and more popular, Brawl just looked tone deaf to a lot of people. 
Yea I agree, I just think melee is a broken mess with no balancing. I understand most of the love is because how fast it is but still.
    If you think Melee is a broken mess with no balancing though, why do you like Brawl?

Really the only Smash which that doesn’t apply to is Smash 4, circa 2015, but Brawl was certainly the least balanced of the original three, and no less broken than the others.
        This doesn’t go for everyone apparently, but I’ve experienced far less bugs and far less crazy broken combos other than meta knight.

I don’t play competitively so that’s probably why I feel it’s less broken, because every melee video I see is several characters being able to infinite combo, like ice climbers and fox and falco and crap like that.
Brawl is surely the worst tournament game, but as a casual game it has more stages and fighters than melee, and better single player content than SSB4. 
    as a casual game my friends and I will probably never stop playing melee just because thats what we grew up on. I think brawl's art style aged really badly; it looks horrible while melee looks ok and 64 has its goofy charm.

The single player content was a lot of fun but i also played that 11 years ago and i doubt i would have as much fun now lol
I think you forget that competitive players are a very loud, but very very tiny minority of the players of smash.

99% of players would look at you like you're speaking a different language as soon as you mention project M

Edit: words are hard 
Fun fact, the internet is full of people willing to share opinions that differ from the majority of people. They also speak loudly.

(I like Brawl too, but its because I really don't like multiplayer and Brawl had a shitload more to do/collect than any other Smash game has... till now? Weird that you don't see people like that at Smash competitions though, eh?)
Pretty much everyone I know thinks Brawl is the best, it’s more accessible than melee and it was on a great console that everyone had to play with friends.

I get the competitive scene doesn’t like Brawl but for casual players the multiplayer was really good, and the SSE was a thing, so we love it.

When my university hosts tournaments (remember this isn’t a competitive tournament, it’s to let people join in and have fun) it uses Brawl still
Assist Trophies also debuted in Brawl, which are amazing. 
Yeah honestly seeing all these zero to deaths and such is getting me mad excited because I'm seeing so many options that look both challenging and rewarding to pull off. The engine for this game looks so damn clean.
    It does look hype, I'm just hoping there will be some real depth to the combos. I was absolutely done with smash4 because, no matter what character you picked, mario players were *always* going to fish for a grab because dthrow uptilts is true until 40-60%. Luigi was always going to do some 0-60 shit. Bayo was always going to get the same 0-death shit.

0-deaths aren't too bad, as long as they require some variation and effort. In 4 you can watch a one minute YouTube video and you'll get 0-60 luigi shit. I'm hoping ult will require at least 5 minutes and a degree of memorization that exceeds that of a goldfish to get combos off.
This is exactly how I've felt since Ultimate was revealed. Maybe Smash 4 will be remembered for customs? Maybe? But every other game has a unique gameplay style (64, Melee) and/or great single-player content (Brawl), and Ultimate, as well as being the newest game, has everything Smash 4 had plus worthwhile single-player. 
I will remember it for the competitive scene, third party characters (Cloud and Ryu announcement made me cry), and the most functional online in the series (so far, let's see what Ultimate has).

Edit: also, first portable experience and amiibos (regardless of how we feel about them, they were a sucess from a Sales point of view).
