It's over, Sm4sh bros... this is unironically the most overcentralized Smash game currently, Brawl MK and Steve have nothing on this

KEN signed up so that's cool, with a recent 1st and 2nd he could be one of the best Smash 4 players now. I heard KEN wanted to win here, but doesn't know what he'll do against Bayo, which will be a problem since he'll have to win 4-5 Bayo sets in a row. He might be DQing if it gets in the way of Ultimate as well.

We could see the Miya Smash 4 DK, yay. I'm writing his FENNEL sponsor for the first time here, in Smash 4 of all places.

In spite of everything, there's some names here that have been entering the few Smash 4 tournaments there are these days, all of the Top 8 seeds here have been getting respectable results.
    Well tbh back in Smash 4 KEN was actually really good vs the Bayo’s and in general Sonic has his ways of dealing with Bayo and the MU is not that terrible
    I think this is a result of the fact that a bunch of the people who still play this game play it specifically because of Bayonetta. I don't think she's as good as this seeding implies.
        I know, but nonetheless it is what it is
It’s insane to me that **most** of the top 6 smash 4 players got cancelled
Lmao
Miya DK sweep PLEASE
If someone asks if Smash 4 Bayo wasn't exaggerated as a problem, show them this seeding.
    Tbf Smash 4 Bayo wasn't as common when the game was active. Still was a problem and broken though.
        >Tbf Smash 4 Bayo wasn't as common when the game was active.

She wasn't in the game for 90% of it being active, that probably helps.
            90%? More like 55%
    Oh yes because the smash con seeding for a game that has been dead for almost 5 years so accurately represents the game's actual meta
    if you love bayo dittos it aint a problem
Lel Goblin with the Smash 4 Roy

I respect it
Zero May Cry mirrors in UltimateMvC3 at Evo2023, (potentially) Bayonetta dittos in Smash4 at SSC2023.
    already was last year, [55% of games on stream were Bayo dittos](https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/woz8x6/super_smash_con_2022_smash_4_characters_on_stream/)
kinda wish we could see tweek smash 4 diddy
Looking forward to watching this. May do an Upsets thread on it just because I love Smash 4 lol (except Cloud, fuck Cloud *cough* and Bayonetta *but I voted for her in the ballot..*)
    I won't be doing one this year so go ahead :)
I always wanted Ness to win a major in Smash 4. He got mega nerfed with the removal of his head-smashing up-air. This game was really fun to spectate up until Bayo started taking over.
Smash 4 > Ultimate
    smash 4 would have been so much better with bayo banned and 3 stocks. it's not a bad game at all but those 2 factors made it so cheesy lol
        3 stocks would have sucked, takes too long to take stocks compared to Ultimate
