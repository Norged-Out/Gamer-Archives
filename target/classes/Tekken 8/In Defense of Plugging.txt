[[In Defense of Plugging]]





I have plugged once on this game and it was like an uncontrollable movement followed by me going ‚Äúwhat the fuck did i just do that for? Idiot‚Äù¬†

Gotta just breathe instead lol
    I'm always reaching for the keyboard to force quit. I never do, but it's like my body acts before my mind is like "hold up, don't be an asshole."
        Fr lol, back out to the PS home screen, breathe in, back into the game.¬†
        I had to quickly kick that bad habit from Brawlhalla. They handle it so well in that game its guilt-free. 

You QQ, autolose + elo penalty, opponent gets a free win and can grind battlepass missions on your bot, and youre already back in another match. Its almost more like surrendering in a cardgame than RQ, you can even leave matches from the menu lol
Yeah, I was like that. Something take control of my body and I just become a pianist with my keyboard. I'm sorry for anyone I encounter and did that. I'm starting to get better at managing my emotions.
    i was like that and after i got my new job as a nurse i accumulated infinite patience and now nothing makes me mad ever. competitive games have become a lot more fun since then.
        So cool, I love when you can transpose what you learn in life/videogame to the other vice versa. Ego needs to go.
        How does working as a nurse make you more patient?
            i work in a retirement home and i need a lot of patience for the residents with alzheimers, so if you have short fuse you just cant do the job. and nowadays o dont really get mad at anything anymore (just a bit salty about pluggers, lol) you also have to be good at deescalating other people (e.g. my colleauges at work) so you just cant afford to get mad in the first place.
                Ah working in a retirement home. 

You‚Äôre much better than me cause I couldn‚Äôt stand being called a n word every 3 seconds.
                    the head nurse is black, lol. The racism fades really fast once they see her everyday and see that she is really nice.
                        Ah that‚Äôs nice HN when I volunteered just told me tough luck
    I have bite marks in my PS2 controller from Tekken 5. This game just does something to me.
        That just made me cackle, sorry.
        Now whenever I make an opponent mad I‚Äôm gonna imagine them biting their controller
I literally accidentally plugged when I got rage arted o the last round and I would've died, but I smashed my controller on my table and that disconnected my internetüò≠
    Sooo your internet cable goes through your table?
        More likely it goes through machines  that were on the table, and the force either dislodged the machines or disrupted their operations.

That or the controller sent an unintended command to exit the game.
            Actually I share internet from my phone with a cable, and the phone was on the desk, and the cable kinda sucks so it disconnected.

I have now started punching the wall insteadüòÄ
            Thats why you use wifi and no cable, you cant disconnect because of slamming things, its just brilliant!
                Nah
                U a law player or what
I only get angry when I understand what the oponnent and I know the counter play but for some god knows what reason they catch me with it every time. I have 0 trouble when somebody is just better. But I guess thats the magic of tekken.
I don't understand how ppl can get so mad at a video game they throw their controller at the wall or whatever lol.
I've seen holes in the wall because people have gotten so mad and punched holes, just wtf is wrong with people
    Anger management issues. I've known people who destroyed controllers over Madden games and they were always prone to getting pissed off over the smallest things.
    I punched my keyboard the other day. I was more mad at myself for being bad than anything lol (even though I practiced a lot)
    Before I went to therapy I punched multiple furnitures, very often. My desk still has a deep dent in it, which I hide with my xxl mousepad. The other furniture was my old bookshelf. Now it's like 4 years ago, and I stopped punching holes.

        i feel that. this is when i get very upset. inputs just fly out the window.
        No for real I‚Äôm so much better when I‚Äôm playing wit friends as opposed to online. Soon as I touch ranked I get really anxious, which leads to forgetting/missing inputs, when then leads to me getting to mad to stand a chance. 

It‚Äôs a vicious cycle lol
    It happens for me when I continue playing when I'm already frustrated from previous opponents. Broke 2 controllers in the past doing that but now I feel like I've matured because I just take long breaks instead when I sense I'm starting to get agitated. Idk how anyone can play ranked (against equally skilled opponents) for longer than 3 hours without getting a bit heated.

&#x200B;

Edit: for example I was just playing quick match and for 40 mins np but then I run into an Azucena that started ki charging? in quick match? It's not like I was playing gimmicky either I was just holding back as Paul while she did strings mostly.
    ive only gotten really mad over a videogame once, in valorant, and it was because of voice chat.

and i guess when i was like 8 i also bit a pillow really hard because i couldnt komplete a raiden kombo in mortal kombat deadly alliance, and a milk tooth fell out. i told my mom i was crying because of the tooth, not the videogame, lol
    It‚Äôs an anger management thing forsho. Been working on it but yeah it‚Äôs still hard. When I‚Äôm mad at a video game I always want to punch or throw something. 

Now I just try to take breaks as soon as I notice any anger at all. Not really a solution but it‚Äôs a lot cheaper at least
So you literally unplugged it
It was Tuesday evening and I was high. You expect me to remember this every week Steam? That mf plugg, oh wait... offline.
Can't even cap if a Hworang uses RA. I'll wait to they're about to win and plug. Honestly, that's the only way to beat him
I kicked the router
I would actually respect pluggers if they did this
    Plugged your mama, respect that.
I respect the ol ron Swanson maneuver
That‚Äôs the definition of it, yeah.
The one and only time I ever plugged was when my pc performance suffered HORRIBLY on Sanctum. Opponent was dashing forward begging me to end it so I decided to take a shortcut so I could immediately lower my settings
Yeah bro, as a FIFA and COD player I completely understand the urge of rage quitting lol. It‚Äôs all on the devs. In Tekken 7, at least, when you get beat up, you get to try but here you feel like it‚Äôs never your turn. It‚Äôs a mashing fest. Rather frustrating
fair
I never do, but I do struggle with tilt because of this game like no other. I uninstalled T8 in favor of less difficult and rage inducing games. The ones I play are Celeste, Elden Ring, Skyrim and Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga. I would also play more Hogwarts Legacy if it did not require an ancient version of Visual C++ all the time. I may reinstall KOFXV as a fun fighting game to play with friends.
Wasn‚Äôt a plug but I still feel bad for being forced to one & done the king that made me break my tv
last night I had my internet go out middle of my set winning rage art I felt like I unintentionally bm'd the dude in a quick match
Idk what plugging is but I hate the matchmaking system and whoever made it needs to fucking get fired and be homeless
I have a weird issue with my ps5 that it sometimes disconnects the cable randomly. So people probably think I plug a lot lol
    Sounds like the cables lock might be loose! Replacing the ethereal cable might help!
As someone whose just stepped away from T8bto check the subreddit because a piece of shit King main who unironically used Special Style plugged, denying me my first ever promotion to purple ranks despite starting in late T7 as well as my 7 win streak which was my highest yet, who was then followed by a Mighty Ruler Hwoarang with a 9 win streak and multiple blue rank characters in their pocket who wiped the floor with me so hard I'm halfway down Tenryu again, I have a quote for you:

"Throw yourself [in] next time and save us all the trouble"
- Gandalf.
No you didn't!
i plug when people use namco's straight OP abusive characters in a spam fashion. little to no reaction time for defense to these characters. simply there for simps who get off on the anime girls and their trashy poking game.
I'm always reaching for the keyboard to force quit. I never do, but it's like my body acts before my mind is like "hold up, don't be an asshole."
    Fr lol, back out to the PS home screen, breathe in, back into the game.¬†
