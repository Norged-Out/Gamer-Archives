[[This guy telling Knee to stop crying and learn the matchup]]





This guy actually thinks knee can't pick up and main Xiaoyu if he wanted to?
    Someone better show the clip of Knee having Tekken God Prime with all characters
        \*Omega
        What a casual, only tekken god prime
    Those Arabic letters make me think he could probably beat knee in a first to 10 lol
        Yep this post is a nonsense)
        What are you even implying? Did you think Pakistanis speak Arabic?
            Now implying that there's a decent amount of soft people in the comments. Chill. Go back to complaining about Tekken characters while you abuse your own character.
                Lmao way to deflect from your racism and geographic retardedness
                    Damn you caught me. How'd you know.
                        I'll hand it to you, you're owning your retardedness really well.
                            Damn how'd you know that too?
                                Thank you for being the adult one here :)

The argument about Arabic letters makes no sense, true, and all tekken players get salty about match ups and prideful about many silly excuses in an attempt to deal with the anguish of not knowing how to get good quickly and consistently in a short amount of time, which is impossible.

You win and stay cool 😎.

(although you started the aggression a bit lol 😂)
                                    By the way, what's happening is that Knee is sharing solid mechanical insights, given all the characteristics of all characters,, Xiaoyu's AOP is a bit OP.

It's good to hear and know this. A. She limits your options in a match when abused. B. The healthy response would be abusing your mains strong ssr catching mid.

Healthy talk yall chillll
                                    It was pretty easy to tell where the guy was going with his first reply.

                    Yeah man
        World champion gets but fucked by 12 year old Pakistani child
    He can’t)
        Knee could 100-0 your main with Mokujin.
            Sure kid, ur Knee is typically picking the strongest/broken chars. He can’t play X or Lei, for that u can look at Arslan)))
                Knee is actually one of the few top tier players that DOESN'T 100% tier whore the top 2 picks all the time.
                Bro doesn’t watch competitive tekken at all lmao
                    He is a legend yes, but he can’t play Ling and never will.
                        He can beat probably 99.99% of Tekken players with basic tools. 

Arslan is part of that .01%, obviously and they're also not ever going to be in a situation where Knee is not picking his mains. 

Knee is the Michael Jordan of Tekken. Arslan Ash is LeBron. He doesn't even have to try to beat some equivalent of a college walk-on just like Jordan would absolutely dumpster 6,999,999,900 if the 7 billion people in the world and the 100 or so he wouldn't, he would still usually beat, he would just have to extend effort to do so
                            Yes I’m
Totally agreed with u, thx for it, but I’m sure that Knee will never pick Ling at tournaments, that’s my position, and if he does and win I will eat my hat)))
                                That's not what you said. 

You said Knee can't play Ling. That is false. He can play Ling better than most people can play Tekken. He could likely enter tournaments with Ling and still make Top 16 but why would he put himself at a disadvantage like that?
                                    Competitively? No and another no) He did that for fun and abuse Sodam unsafe style and his knowledge of matchup)
                                    He is billing Sodam again with broken king not Ling))

https://youtu.be/An-3NlmCIvY?si=FkE4riRFM9nq3fNE
                        He already has my guy. He made it to top rank with Ling.
                            I have seen Arslan training with Ling, do you have a proof about Knee? I have seen all Lings on YouTube since T3)))
                                https://www.reddit.com/r/Tekken/s/fKQ3MNtnZf

Knee made it to the highest rank (Tekken God Omega) with every single character in Tekken 7, I think it's fair to say he knows how to play Ling.
                lol he beat the crap out of mainman with kazuya, mainman's main for years.
            😂😂😂
I thought the same when i saw this shit lol.

How can someone tell the guy who achieve max rank in all characters to learn the match up. Even worse, the dude have been playing Sodam for soo long that i doubt there's something yet for him to learn about countering Ling.
    Me on my way to telling the most accomplished tekken player in history to go practice more 🤡
        So did Arslan listen to your advice and practice more?
            Arslan is undoubtedly the best player on earth, but accomplished? Knee takes that.
                Nobody beats Knee when it comes to Tekken as a whole. I’m sure Arslan would be amazing in previous games as well but Knee JDCR Qudans, these guys dominated Tekken from the get go and were in the spotlight. 

I’d never deny Arslan wouldn’t be a god in previous games but since we haven’t seen him then. I’m gonna put my money on Knee being the greatest player across the entire tekken competitive life.
            Did we just forget Knee's history of Tekken prior to Tekken 7?
                Nah. Arslan still the GOAT
                    If he keeps dominating Tekken 8, you could make that case. Until then it's Knee.
                    dominating for the last years doesnt make you the GOAT, even then Knee won a Evo final against him so its not like its full on domination.
                        Arslan is the GOAT just be the peak alone. Knee has never been as dominant as Arslan was during the end half of T7. He showed up out of  no where and dominated the whole scene for 4 years in a row. I know Knee has been near the top since Tekken5 but he has never peaked quite like Arslan did AND the scene during T7 was way more competitive than before T7.
                            even Arslan lost a EVO final during his "peak" against Knee. besides Arslan still has to prove himself on anything else other than Tekken 7. Knee been on top for several games for two decades.
Is arslan the Tekken 7 GOAT? sure.
                                Knee won Khan in the EVO finals, not Arslan. But indeed we seem to disagree on what makes somebody the GOAT. I absolutely love Knee and always root for him (unless he is playing against JDCR) and I hope he can claim his title back with Tekken8
            knee been on top since 2005, he might not be the current best but he is the most accomplished one by a mile.
        Least oppressive Asian parent be like:
    This is what everyone says when anyone complains about any character in this game. Knee, git gud and stop being a scrub /s
    i dont think you remember rangchu winning twt because the best pro tekken players genuinely didnt know the matchup
        Rangchu is fucking good as fuck. It's not just that the best players didn't know the matchup, it's more that it's hard to find someone at his level to train against.

Playing a bear does come with perks like being a southpaw, but Rangchu routinely beats top players from Japan and Korea.
            It was absolutely awesome to watch Qudans and Knee try to punish Panda's ff2(?) time after time with different buttons and never have any success at it. TWT 2018 was something else
                Especially since Devil Jin has a very strong punish to that move, better than the rest of the roster at the time
            Also even if some wins were due to matchup knowledge that's just because panda is a low priority matchup to learn, that isn't the case with a high tier like xiaoyu, knee is actively trying to figure her out and failing to do so
                In the case of TWT Finals that doesn't fly. All 19 finalists were decided a month before Finals (and some were already guaranteed a spot almost 2 months in advance). So its basic due diligence to study and prepare for every other finalist. The only wildcard is the LCQ winner.



Also Knee and Qudans had faced Rangchu's Panda multiple times throughout the 2018 TWT and beaten him every time they crossed paths. So its more likely they felt confident in their tactics against him. What made the difference was that Rangchu explained he would train the Devil Jin matchup with LowHigh for up to something like 8 hours a day. Since they had the same sponsor at the time. Rangchu had impeccable timing on when Qudans would go for hellsweep and Qudans kept fucking up the punish for bear ff2 (which was identical to Hei ff2). Also Knee had practically already won against Rangchu in LF. Dude just dropped the killing combo and Rangchu did not let that chance slip.



At that level of play, those are the type of things that are more important factors for winning. Reducing it to "low priority bear matchup" dismisses the effort Rangchu put in. You can't bank on trying to blindside the best players using the strongest characters with knowledge checks at Finals. You can take advantage of slip-ups (Knee's one-in-a-million combo drop) or failure to adapt (Qudans not using an easier consistent punish) sure but those aren't things you rely on as a winning strategy.
                    Thank you, at least not everyone is a gaslighter around here.
                    At a high level comfort in a matchup is similar to matchup knowledge too though. If you have the knowledge on how to deal with a character but then your also fighting a player of a high skill level recalling that info when you don't have to use it often while your mental stack is so high leads to mistakes like not punishing properly and being slower to react to stuff.
            Wdym bears have both arms forward at the same time lol. They are both southpaw and orthodox at the same time
        Panda is not ling tho. Panda seen way less often than ling.
    Oh no, how dare someone tell an ordinary person (Because he's just a streamer dude, why you yanking at him), to learn the matchup.

Apparently Knee is the almighty and powerful. No one is allowed to tell him anything. or a wave of his fans will come and start acting like 15 year old fan girls squealing over Taylor Swift.
        You're overthinking it. The point isn't that Knee is beyond reproach, it's simply that he obviously already knows the matchup.
        The irony is that this guy is telling the player that probably knows the matchup against xiaoyu better than anyone else in the world, to learn the matchup. 
            I'd bet Knee smokes that random tweeter if he played Xiaoyu and limited himself to 2 buttons.
        You guys take this in such a weird direction all the time.

Knee has plenty of Xiaoyu experience (He had her in Tekken God Omega in T7) and he frequently scrims with Sodam, one of the oldest and most well-known Xiaoyu specialists who pioneered many of her tech and setups still in-use today.

Knee knows the matchup. Saying he doesn't is disingenuous. It's nothing like he's 'all-powerful' it's just factual. Not sure why you or twitter users have an issue with this.

Even Arslan has Xiaoyu in his top 5. Why are you so pressed little guy?
        You're right. Xiaoyu is perfectly balanced. So is Zafina. No buffs needed. 

🙄
        Nice trolling
    its definitely a joke / troll post
    He told him that because the dumb ass response to anyone talking about character balance is to assume they are just complaining and don't know the matchup despite people saying that to people they don't know the skill level of.  


This is never a counter argument even if Knee wasn't one of the best most knowledgeable players . If you think someone doesn't know the matchup you show them proof they are wrong but these Ling players couldn't do that because Knee knows the game better than all of them and he meant exactly what he said and had the facts to back it up.  


Every single comment that tried to argue against him was just people ignoring the facts or providing evidence that didn't disprove knees point. Like being dishonest about her move having the same evasiveness in all past Tekkens which was literally just them lying.  


This whole thing just showed me that the "GIT GOOD" crowd usually just say that because they are snowflakes and thats the way they found to respond to shit they don't like to hear.
If you're going to call out Knee, you better be confident your argument is concrete. Instead he resorts to name calling 😂
    Shut up hella scrupman
        😂
        *WASTED*
        Fuck man, you got me 😂🤣
tbh he did learn the Zafina matchup. To the point where Arslan's Zafina only won one competitive match and lost 4 to Knee's Feng. Arlsan lost 1-3 grand finals at the Tokyo eSports invitational and then lost one match at gamer's 8 to knee with Zaf.

Arslan even said on stream he couldn't quite figure out why his Zafina was so effective against other Feng players (Kkokkoma, Joka, etc) but not knee.
correct me if im wrong, but knee aint complaining about AOP, hes complaining about AOP THEN ducking while in the stance. he said it AVOIDS LOWS (not all but some, i think) with right timing on the duck
    no, he complains about Xiaoyu's kit being overloaded: AoP duck, side step AoP duck and Hipnotist 2 being +5 on block. In short, you cant press into Xiaoyu but you also can't play defensively.
        Xiaoyu's evasion wouldn't be such a problem if she also didn't have stupidly high damage when she's traditionally been a low damage character.


Coupled with her great oki and the extremely strong hipnotist mixup during heat tips it over the top.
            Facts. She has insane evasion coupled with her offense being really good this time around and really good damage.

Xiaoyu kills you whether you attack or defend. Like release Leroy.
                Release leroy was basically a T8 character in T7, X is just playing T8 along with her usual stance bullshit which might be too much/op idk 90% of the cast seems overtuned to me.
                    No, Tekken 8 characters are juiced but release Leroy was a different beast lol. I played him quite a bit on release and basically the main problems were:

* 1,1 ch jab string dealing 50 damage and wall splatting
* ff3 being homing, + on block and launching on hit - basically an electric
* df1 being -1 AND having followups, something that was unique to Heihachi, making it insane paired with his ch tools
* Orbital being -3 on block - A mid low crushing launcher with the same frames as a df1 on block. You could sidestep and murder your opponent if they tried to press something after blocking orbital
* Cane being a long ranged mid launcher that was +8 on block, basically a second Rage Drive, and it also dealt like 50 damage before the combo so it was absolutely insane
* d2, delayed 4 combo ender making sure every combo of his did 85+ without a wall
* His wall combo with hermit 4 into floor punches dealing insane damage - like nearly 40 - and also floor breaking on forgotten realm, I did 140 damage combos on that stage without rage
* b2 parry and b1+2 mid i12 ch launcher being impossible to whiff punish

Even in Tekken 8 I don't think there's anyone as OP as release Leroy
                        I like how even listing out all these broken stuff you didn't even get to d1+2, the crazy long range, mid CH launcher, that forced crouching and was 0 on block.  Genuinely just one of the most spammable moves to ever be in Tekken.  Leroys at evo Japan would use this move for their entire neutral.
                            lmao shit I forgot that one, yeah that move was insane

I also just remembered one more, db1,1+2 second hit was a mid ch launcher and safe on block
                            Still crazy to me that Noroma made top8 with basically a Day 1 Leroy. Stream chat was losing their shit at how Noroma had no combos, but was still winning.
                        I suppose we'll see at evo lol. 

I agree there's def no one character as overloaded like he was on release but instead of just one character being absolutely bullshit now it feels like most of the cast is a mini leroy and I'm not sure if I like that any better.
                            Combo Breaker will be a good showcase of top players.
                            I think Dragunov comes kinda close, maybe Azucena too haha. Just about every character can snowball into unending pressure once they gain momentum, but Dragunov feels like he can force his momentum whenever he wants
                                No version of Drag comes close to Leroy lmao
                        What about fahk lol he was a different beast too
                        I remember through all of that dumb people just kept saying git good despite the character being clearly broken.
                    The problem is her offense is good and leaves her at plus. This makes her access to aop and its variants easy. Her evasion is top tier and you can't retaliate.
            Straight up she wouldn't annoy me so much if I didn't feel like I was taking 50% every time she touched me.
            Also this is the first game where AOP duck can consistently dodge lows apparently
        The fact is that she has it all, best evasion, Hella good stance mixups a ton of damage and a ton of plus frame or negative in to high mid crush stance that makes you basically plus
    Yep, pretty much. Knee even backs up his words and people still jump on him.
        yeah, people online/twitter cant seem to read or have low reading comprehension or just want to latch on something that "outrages" them
            It's specifically Ling mains that seem to be very emotionally charged over this discourse.
                Asked someone and they told me it's not fair because no one complains this much about Devil Jin
                    That's the premier defense. The 'whataboutism'. Like "Well what bout Dragunov/Devil Jin/Feng?" etc etc.

It's crazy how you can't point anything out without some Ling main trying to direct the conversation away from Ling. So weird.
                        Its the Ling agenda lmao. Although to be fair alot of people do that when their main is a strong its not just Ling players.
                            I've seen the guy you're talking to on here also telling Knee to get good. Absolutely hilarious and delirious cunt that guy.
                                ikr xD. Ill never get people getting so defensive about their mains that they are willing to spread misinfo, gaslight and be nasty over a video game lmao.
                                    I assure you, the guy in the screenshot and the guy you're talking to. Knee would fold the if they use Xiaoyu and he just jabbed.
        if he believes it's that strong that it should be nerfed while ignoring drag, he better pick her up and just win tourneys with her like he did with Feng.
            This is such an emotional response tantamounting to whataboutism. Dragunov doesn't have any stance that evades lows.

Not that that matters though lol.
                I dont know. I kind of agree with that guy. If he thinks Xiaoyu is so overloaded and that AOP duck is incredibly OP just play it and use it. That's his job if he's a professional player, no?
                    There legit hasn't even been a big tourney until April? You guys need to relax lmao. Not sure why you talk like there's been 10 tournaments when there's hasn't been one (big) tourney.

Also, he can talk about strong things. He's more adept at sussing things out than random joe like in the screenshot. Nothing wrong with that. People seem personally offended that Knee said one thing in their favourite characters kit is overloaded. So weird.
                        You're acting like this is one comment Knee made about it. The screenshot in question is him doubling down, lol. People aren't personally offended, it's just he seems to go out of his way to talk about it more. Of course people are reacting to that, that's why it's here too.
                            Doubling down? He presented evidence to his claims. How is that doubling down. I didn't know substantiating your claims was doubling down. Jesus christ. You guys are really emotional.

Also, people are definitely personally offended. Look at this thread and look at how the guy reacted telling Knee to 'learn the matchup'.

Look at the twitter thread and tell me with a straight face people aren't personally offended.
                    MKLeo in smash played Byleth, who was considered low tier at the time, because he liked the character. The dude won multiple tournaments with them to the point where people changed their minds about the character’s placement on a tier list. There were multiple other characters at the time that were considered way more meta or broken than Byleth, but MKLeo thought Byleth was more fun and interesting to play. 

It’s the same concept here. Knee isn’t obligated to play the most broken character because she’s broken and that definitely doesn’t negate his very valid criticism.
                        Facts. People get weirdly emotional about Xiaoyu for some reason. Alot of whataboutism and personal attacks (learn the match up to knee lol).
                            Yeah I’ve watched a couple videos summarizing what people are saying (because I don’t have enough free time to constantly monitor what Twitter is saying lol) and X mains definitely seem to be upset because their character got called out.

I mean, I get it. If Zafina was this broken then I’d be upset the top Tekken player was calling for nerfs too.
                                It sucks people can't separate themselves from their main. Dragunov for example, I don't deny he's top 5 and very strong and needs some tuning.

And yeah I watched PhiDx's video on it. Great summary and relatively neutral. And the X mains still gave him shit for it when his proposed nerfs was just nerfing her frame advantage on HYP2.
                        He's not obligated but I think "whining" or "criticism" depending on your perspective has a different color when you are a pro player as opposed to a mighty ruler guy playing from his couch on the weekends. 

It's fine to play what you like and think another character is strong but people endlessly ragged on lets say Speedkicks in T7 when he retired and said Akuma and etc. was too annoying to deal with but he wanted to stick with Hwo, he didn't want to play them. 

It's just kind of "want your cake and eat it too" as a professional to complain but also want to win doing your own way. As a professional your job is to win, so you should play what you personally think gives you the best chance to win. That's kind of exclusive with saying "XYZ character has too many tools and is extremely overbearing against the game" (not quoting him). It's eyeroll to tell Knee to "find the answers" but also, that is the correct generic response that people willingly use against others (accurately) when it suits them.
            Just because a character is broken doesn’t mean characters are obligated to play them lmao. If Knee had fun playing her then he would. That doesn’t mean he can’t criticize how broken she is.
    thats not unique to tekken 8
    I agree that she's broken, but I don't think she can actually duck lows in any situation.

She sidesteps every time she enters AOP, and some lows can be sidestepped. That can give the illusion that she "ducked" it because the ducking and sidestep animations play simultaneously.

That is still pretty broken though and I think might be what his complaint is really about. She literally has a button that evades highs and some lows simultaneously.

Even though she's not technically "ducking" the low, she *can* duck-react certain lows to evade them since the sidestep is automatic.

Maybe she can use the lower AOP duck to actually duck special lows though. I could see that, and that's super broken if no other character can do that lol
        [ive seen this tweet](https://i.imgur.com/eBjm3QU.mp4) which she already stopped the sidestepping animation and dodged hwoarangs low
            lol that's awesome

Is that kick a full on low or an s.low? Either way I can't decide which is more broken, Xiaoyu being able to duck it or Hwoarang even having that as an attack.

Man slightly adjusts his posture for 2 frames and that's a low hit somehow...probably one of those stupid kicks that cancels your guard too so he gets a guaranteed high+mid after it.
    He’s pointed out how it’s kinda bs that side step right AOP also avoids moves that are supposed to “track” side stepping moves but he only really has a problem with AOP duck. I think that’s the general gist of things but at this point so many have chimed in that it’s hard to remember.
Didn't arslan and knee both say ling has a five way mix up?
    Bah, Arslan and Knee should just learn the matchup, they didn't cry about Zafina before, or their character Feng at some points.  

If they can't pick up and main a strong Xiaoyu then they should stop complaining.  

What's next? Jesandy's commenting on King or Speedkicks on Hwoarang? Bunch of total noobs if you ask me!
        i'm just saying, This\_Is\_The\_End never lost to Knee or Arslan...
            I haven't lost to them either, and I'm new to Tekken, so how good can they really be...?
                Probably just a bunch of circlejerks
"GIT GOOD KNEE"
Funny when sodam himself admitted ling is busted in this game…. and he enjoys it.
Knee mains the entire roster and still has scrubs coming at him like this. Never change Tekken community, never change 😂
Xiaoyu players are delusional
    Anybody telling Knee to learn the matchup is delusional lmao.
        While yes, also, no, in particular xiaoyu mains are delusional. Character is brain dead OP
    We don't claim him
    Maybe because she is one of the less popular characters for past 7 years and was low tier in t7 no one gave a fuck, no one played her in CBT and there are other broken, more popular tournament viable characters in the game. Yhere is a high chance that devs will overnerf her because of all that talking which will end up with another few years of Ling being irrelevant.

Just a guess.
        She is totally tournament viable this game lmao, she’s top 1. And she was not low tier last game. Solid mid tier during the last 3 seasons
    Just like lei players fr
        Tf you mean Lei players he not even in the game anymore lol
            The Lei community used to tell everyone he was one of the hardest characters in the game. He’s basically just a labbing nightmare. When a community for a character is very small they tend to dictate the image of that character. Xiaoyu is similar to Lei in that aspect. People used to say she’s extremely hard to play and that she’s mid tier at best. As soon as people start saying she’s good and needs tuning down they all grab the pitch fork’s because they’re all delusional about their main.
                Damn you must have some serious Lei ptsd lol
                    Nah, that’s just how that was for tekken 7. There’s literally nothing difficult about lei, just add more bullshit at the end of the last bullshit. The lei players were delusional for years about it. Same with xiaoyu players. Same with yoshi players. Same with Nina players, except after blue ranks, that character is actually hard as shit
                        Nina can bulldoze lower ranks that don't respect her plus frames or don't know how to step / duck some of her strings. However, the moment you hit a high-ish rank, the nightmare starts. You need to be extremely cracked to deal with players that know how to deal with Nina. It's not free neutral like Dragunov / Jun / Xiaoyu for example.
                        That's what I'm saying man, we're in T8. Mental scarring from tekken 7 is literally post-traumatic lol.
                            It’s just annoying to play block the 5 min string and low parry at the end into get the fuck off the floor with your opponent for 3 rounds.
                        Yoshi isn't difficult? Being in the same convo as Nina and Xiaoyu feels wrong lol
                            Yoshi is not difficult. And 10000% in the same category as Nina and ling
                                You just repeated what I said but as affirmative, idk why u think that tho
                                    Best panic move in the game, broken move in general, easy combos, fucked range, “gimmicks” up the ass but really they’re good tools. Flash should be -25
                erm, when was Lei ever top tier?
                thats not even true, every lei main i ever saw on here would talk about how he appears hard at first but encouraged people to play him because with time spent he wasn't that difficult. this sub just wants any excuse to hate on lei. Some of you have such entitled behavior about different characters based on what you think the game should be like and it's really annoying.
    he's also a lol player, judging from his pfp
    To be fair, most Tekken players are.
        Wrong
Course it's gotta be a league player too lol
    Its like Faker complaining about K'sante and some random Silver player tells him to just learn the matchup 🤣🤣🤣
i unironically love ESL twitter slap fights
    [You are fucking! No you are fucking!](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej45H8MMgfg)
dude has a league of legends pfp, dont think anyone should take this clown seriously
"I used to be a gamer like you, but then I took a Xiaoyu to the Knee" (??)
People dont even know what he's complaining about lol its AOP + duck, not AOP. He says that's "bugged" because moves that should hit (and *did* hit in previous games) now do not, allowing to phase through attacks and press buttons freely.

Like seriously people, go win one EVO before talking shit to Knee
    More than this, it’s the evasion coupled with the damage output. See PhiDX’s recent video on this topic - he outlined all of the arguments.
        Omg when I say Bryan’s db2 getting evaded and zafinas df1 I was like nah this shit is wild, lili coudnt step it but xiayou can
            It’s actually broken.
        I still think people are being a little disingenuous though. 

Here guys look how OP she is when you add in a wall AND a stage bounce into the same combo. Almost like 70% of the cast couldn’t reach that damage. Hell I reached 130 damage with Paul using only a wall break, no stage bounce.

They didn’t show that she very literally has the lowest natural combo damage in the game though did they? Nope, because it doesn’t fit the agenda. 

I like PhiDX quite a lot, but it was pretty shitty to leave out that the combos that happen in 90% of situations are in fact trash damage compared to the rest of the cast. Instead shows a combo where the opponent hits the wall at a perfect time AND gets a stage bounce… yeah like no fucking shit ofc you can do some crazy stuff from that combo that might happen once every 100 games. 

Disingenuous!
    Maybe he should learn the matchup and stop complaining like a scrub
    The issue isn't that they are talking shit to knee. Its that they are objectively wrong and Knee is literally providing proof and they are still being stupid. If a green rank player pointed these things out they would still be correct.  


Its just doubly stupid this person responded to one of the best and most knowledgeable players that way.
Knee's resilience pisses people off. Guy's been around for so long and showing no sign of slowing down. Am so glad he is being more vocal on Twitter now, his opinion on the meta is super important.
So bold you almost have to respect it.
Comments like that are so weird because he's already going out of his way to lab this character and that's what made him realise she's busted in his eyes
Forgetting the fact that it's knee Vs some no name, there is a general thing where people HATE Xiaoyu and HATE aop stance in particular.

People have been complaining about that stance for multiple Tekkens and I'm sure its been nerfed multiple times. I used to say that's it's been nerfed so much that the stance will soon lose to highs.

The thing is that her evasion is supposed to be a key part of her gameplay and in a game like Tekken 8, they are supposed to be enhancing those key aspects of each characters gameplay. Maybe she system also suits her more in Tekken 8 because she is designed to blow up aggressive players. In Tekken 7 you could just turtle her and she struggled to get in.

The trouble is that nobody likes having to adjust their gameplan completely just to fight the character, which is why I think evasive characters such as Zafina got less hate.

I hope they don't, but I'm pretty sure they will nerf xiaoyu and probably to the point where she is only strong against the people who don't know the match up.
    I agree with this take. I don't understand how we went from "certain aspects of Xiao may be bugged or OP" to "she is a completely brain dead button mash character who breaks the game". People are taking Knee's relatively mild criticism of her and extrapolating it wildly.
        People are extrapolating it wildly because the character is very hated in general at all levels of play. I personally agree with the brain dead thing since if someone doesn't know your character you don't have to really work hard at all to just land stuff vs them so knowledge check characters will always have a brain dead element to them until you hit higher level play and even then some players will still not know the matchup.  


Since some people are making great points about what aspects of her are overtuned alot of people are using that to hop on the train and just air their frustrations about the character even if some of them aren't because she is broken its because they just don't know the matchup.
    I hope they don't overnerf he as well. Her evasion should be toned down a bit but otherwise the char is fine. She's frustrating if you don't know the matchup for sure that will never change even with nerfs but her turn stealing is so good it enables the rest of her kit to be waaaaay more threatening than it should be.  


It would suck if they nerf the rest of her kit just to let her keep the evasion she has now.
Funniest shit I've ever seen. 

Imagine asking a priest to pray more.
Aris was right. Tekken fans might be the worst fighting game fandom. I’ve seen too many comments on these posts that scream delusional.
She’s so broken it’s not even funny this balance patch was ass
    I don’t think this is the main balance patch this was the bug fix I think that’s next balance patch where they will fix some of this stuff
        Please god before I lose my mind 😂
    She totally carries the player in her current state. I’ve lost to several Xiaoyu players recently who had no business being the rank they were. 

It’s the evasion + damage output that makes her busted.
        >She totally carries the player in her current state.

This is a bit unfair. Why can't people criticize something without overcorrecting? She's probably OP, yes, but clearly it takes skill and practice to play her well. Her winrate sits at 45% currently. A lot of low level Ling players, myself included, get their teeth kicked in regularly.

I think she is OP once you know the ins and outs of her playstyle, but to get to that point takes a while.
            She carries the player because she has overly high damage and is characteristically evasive. She gets a launching throw into a full combo. She goes under a lot of lows (as outlined by PhiDX’s video).

It’s not difficult to understand. 

Her T7 form was fair because she conformed to Tekken rules.
                Yes, she is OP. That doesn't mean she 'carries' everyone who plays her. It still takes skill and practice. This is what I mean when I say people are overcorrecting. There is no happy middle ground between "character is OP, everyone who plays her is shit" and "character is fair, everyone who plays them is good". It's either one extreme or the other with this community.
                    Reddit + Tekken (FGC, honestly). Don't expect too much when you come here.
                "Her T7 form was fair" 
Fucking lol.
I guess Xiao is only fair when she's bottom 5 huh
                    Exactly.
                    tbh with an archetype like hers they are usually Top 5 or Bottom 5 no inbetween. Very difficult to balance
            Any character that is obscure and allows you to breeze through matches you wouldn't otherwise because your opponent doesn't know the matchup. Your opponent not knowing your character does make the game easier for you so saying she carries people to an extent is just true. Its the case of any knowledge check heavy character.  


I say this as someone that in 7 played many characters including Xiaoyu and i played her when i was much much worse at the game and she was one of the easiest chars for me to win with vs players far above my skill level.
                There is a difference between saying a character carries a player to an extent and that they 'totally carry them'.

And the whole thing about not knowing the matchup applies to all characters. Do you think I know King's throws, Hwoarang's barrage of kicks or Yoshimitsu's shenanigans as a beginner?

Lastly, to even be able to play Xiao at a level where her stance play truly confuses opponents and make for a knowledge check, you need lots and lots of practice. A Xiao noob is just as likely to K.O. themselves as they are their opponent, because of how vulnerable her stances make her.

So while I respect your experience, I respectfully disagree.
                    It doesn't equally apply to all characters because some characters knowledge checks are easier to figure out OR are less rewarding even when your opponent doesn't understand them.  


The idea that Ling's stances make her vulnerable especially at lower to mid level play is blatantly dishonest considering the stance is highly evasive and the moves that can hit it are not as rewarding AND require specific knowledge to check that Ling can counter even if they have that knowledge. If i enter AOP vs the vast majority of players i don't even have to know how AOP works and my opponent will just miss because they don't know how to counter AOP. The idea that you need to alot of practice when they literally can't hit you without doing a very very limited set of moves they are unlikely to pick because they don't know is disingenuous at best. If they don't know they don't know and the only thing you need to practice is "how to enter AOP"  


You are right though that saying that they "totally carry them" is different. But as someone who plays MANY characters. Some characters are just MUCH MUCH easier to win with when your opponent doesn't know the char and its not at all equivalent across all chars.   


You only need alot of practice to use Ling's stance vs people that know the matchup. Its funny that you bring up Yoshimitsu because what your saying about Xiao's stances is actually true for Yoshimitsu at least in tekken 7. His moves are so niche and weak and his knowledge checks require either the opponent to not attack (which is rare at low levels where hyper offense is incredibly common) and are not as rewarding AND can get you clipped if misused.
hella scrupman
These started to show up since Arsalan defeated knee, literally they think knee is a noob, no respect and logic at all just pure shitting on him for nothing.
“ yea okay go win a tournament bitch” -knee
Ahah people like this just make my day
So as someone who is new to tekken, this is like if I were to go tell Faker he needs to learn the matchups better?
League of legends icon, automatic monkeybrain. Also he prob mains xiaoyu too. The state of xiao is totally toxic, there should definetly be a higher skill for the evasion, if braindead green rank can do it, there is a problem.
Chances are Knee already knows more about xiayou than whatever vet xiayou main you can think of
That commenter should play against Knee’s Xiaoyu and see if he’ll cry about the matchup lol
It is almost like something specific is the problem with her, not everything. Evasion + great combos is very strong
Can we have Xiaoyu win a major first before we start asking for nerfs? I don’t even main her, just let the Xiaoyu mains have this for a bit. 😂😂😂
Bro is spitting
As a bad xiaoyu main, it’s a bit jarring to see a very strong player say that despite now knowing what the move will avoid it’s still too strong.

It’s not a free knock up or an op move afaik and someone can explain (probably aggressively) why it is to me, but why is this coming out now? She could do this move in 7 what changed?
    https://youtu.be/gnfOW6d09lE?si=QYovAyaBQvrd01J7 aop is actually stonger now then it used to be
        It’s interesting seeing these guys talk about it bc 5 frames is all it takes for it to be a different game. 

I agree w speedkicks vs the remove low AoP bc that might fundamentally change the game for pros and high level but doesn’t make them useless in mid or lower level player hands.

Ngl though I’m no where close to being good enough for any of this to really effect my games outcome 😅
            ya i dont have horse in the race im pretty sure she is suppose to duck bryans shit and "fixing" this wont change it
                I'm pretty sure her ducking mids that are known to work against duck AOP and her straight up ducking lows is what needs fixing
Some people will say anything to get some attention…
As a Xiaoyu main I admit her aop is OP.....


Good 😈 it needs to stay that way
Attacks literally pass through Ling when she does AoP duck. It's like she has invincibility frames during the animation. You can see the weapon trail of Victors knife pass straight through her, as one example.  And then SSR AoP completely negates lows or ground hitting mids that normally have strong tracking to the right. These 2 things are just busted and should be addressed
I will agree that AOP is strong and that sometimes it has some confusing/unintuitive interactions.  What I don't get is how everyone follows that up with "and therefore Ling needs nerfs".  If you believe she's overpowered, show me Ling boasting an insane winrate.  Show me her winning majors, or Top 8 at TNS being full of Ling mirrors, or all the top players picking her in order to stay competitive.  None of that shit is happening.  I'm so sick of people theorycrafting how Ling is broken and ruining the game because her stance can go under lows sometimes.  Then, when you call them out that it's really not so strong, they pivot into talking about HYP 50/50s being too strong (as if the entire cast doesn't have strong 50/50s too).  If people want to make an argument that she's overall too powerful then fucking prove it, don't just blabber about it on xitter.

Yeah I'm pissed about this, but you would be too if the character you've been maining since 1997 suddenly became the subject of a bunch of bullshit rhetoric.  People play the game for an hour a week and then spend an hour a day on xitter parroting stuff they hear content creators say.  Harada listens to this shit way too closely, he will nerf her just because people ask for it rather than look at any data first.  I want to see Ling actually place well in tournaments for once, but every time she starts to appear even a little bit strong people cry to Daddy Harada and he nerfs her, like he did in Tekken 7.  Stop clutching your damn pearls and either play her yourself and prove she's overpowered, or stfu.
    People who think she is EZ mode will attempt to play her themselves only to realize that they can't, after which much of their argument falls flat.  
A lot of comments in one of MainManSWE's latest tirade videos against Ling actually tried to claim that "all you need to do to play Ling is to button mash". So while I respect Knee's knowledge, this is the level we are at with a lot of the criticism. It's just empty parroting, as you say.

Watch both of us get downvoted to oblivion for pointing it out though.

The best we can hope for now are some moderate nerfs to her more annoying/OP moves (which do exist), after which we can hopefully be left alone by the howling chimpanzees.
        I recently picked up Xiaoyu because I've always been interested in the character, but I've never really liked playing a "top tier" in any game. (A bit early to claim top tiers imo, but thats where is on every list I've seen) And you're right. Pretending like Xiaoyu is a button mashing character is pretty absurd. She has so many stances and moves that will put you on a halt and if you don't learn what they do, you're not going anywhere.
    To be fair, a stance that can go under lows is annoying as fuck to play against because it’s inconsistent. Having Xiaoyu dodge a low and then combo you is rage inducing. Especially when there’s a large probability it’s a bug.
        Honestly, I'm ok with some tweaks to what AOP~D can dodge, but that's not where the conversation has gone.  What started as "hey maybe AOP~D shouldn't dodge lows" has become "Ling is overpowered, ruining Tekken, and her HYP stance is too strong".  That's what's so damn frustrating to me right now.
    If ling players cant win without her bein' broken then they dont deserve to have her at all
imagine going to a multiple world championship winner and telling him what is in essence "l2p" lmao
    The top pros can definitely be wrong, but I don't think there is ever a circumstance where you can tell them to "learn the matchup." It's literally their job. They know the matchup.
    Game has been out for a month
Pakistani guy most likely, their community really dislike Korea.
    Knee is like a god in Pakistan.
        Astagfirknee bro
    his name is in Arabic
        Doesn't necessarily mean he's Arab. Muslim people like to incorporate some Arabic in their life, this includes communities in Pakistan, Malaysia, etc
            My Arabic's rough, but I think it says "Owner of the Big Shadow". Also, that's the default League of Legends profile pic. And the aggressive, trolley energy ... 99.99% chance of Arab with a 0.01% chance of SE Asian (Phillipino, Malaysian).

Source: 🡢🡠🡧🡣🡮🡢1️⃣
            it means he's most likely Arab instead of Pakistani
    Or maybe, Knee is a normal person and it's okay to critise his playing.

Oh also, someone's location has no hand in this.
        Knee a normal person? 

Yeah Mike Tyson was a normal person too.

Both people are top 0.001 % in their field. That’s not normal at all. 
        You must be Beerus level of strength in Tekken if you think Knee is a normal guy lol.
            part of what makes the pros so sick is that they are just normal people. that's why we all have the potential to get there. he's one of us.

bootlicking a celebrity is why epstein's island could exist for so long.
                Being at the top of any respective field would actually make you abnormal. Not many people can be considered the best, Knee has consistently for many years been considered the best/one of the best so he's in fact not normal. Messi, Mike Tyson, Michael Phelps, Usain Bolt etc are at the top of the food chain in what they do. Normal is whatever the most common rank in T8 is if you wanna get technical bro. Normal is most of the people that are reading and commenting on this thread. I have never won a major and neither have you, so I don't see how you get the idea these guys are the same as us when it comes to Tekken. Also, I'm not bootlicking anybody. I respect Knee and have been following him for years I don't see how we go from Tekken to Epstein's Island but hey, the snarky comment really added to this conversation! Thanks, all you gotta do next is mention a current event and a politician to really derail this convo. I'd love to hear more bro. Really! Keep going! 🫵🏾😂
                    [see emoji at the end of wall of text]

[downvote and move on without reading]

LOL
        I agree with your second point but Knee is not just a normal person lol he was arguably top 2 in the world for like 18 years
        Criticizing his playing, is at best, dodgy. Yes obviously you'll find the odd mistake in his playing, but it'd be like the guy that plays football on the weekends with his mates trying to tell Messi to get good and do better. Knee is one of the GOATs of Tekken, and while not infallible, his word should always have strong weight attached to it purely due to his raw experience and skill.
Arslan Ash burner account found?
    arslan also voiced out about ling being op btw
Lmao. Doesn't matter how much you 'learn'. She avoids lows like nothing. It's stupid and obviously bugged.
I mean she's been high effort, low damage, low tier character for ages. Now that she has some degree of relevance the complai train starts and she'll be nerfed for the next 7 years again.
Haters when xiao is finally viable
    Hmmm? She's in the same situation as she was in Tekken 7 during it's initial release, top 3.
        She got absolutely fucking killed in s2
Tekken autists when anything ever is evasive and messes with their turn-based rigid-ass gameplay.
Us Ling mains do get a little annoyed. Shes been ass for 6 games straight (T4,T5,T6,Tag2,TR and T7). Now she finally a contender for tournaments and Knee of all people are crying over her. Where was the crying about Feng back in T7? If shes busted pick her up and play her so she gets nerfed. Btw Feng is still top3 in this game alongside Dragunov and Devil Jin, so maybe he should tweet a little about his own main too.
    yeah, why cant she have totally overtuned evasion plus ridiculous combo damage (with spike into unscaled ground hit) plus a -12, homing, unseeable low launcher that can be mixed with a +5 on block mid? i dont see the issue either...
        If you get hit by the fully charged Launcher that is on you. She needs to charge it for the launcher, so if you don't interupt her that's your mistake. The real mix is the knockdown in HEAT since it's instant. Also like I said. If shes so strong just play her and win. But you hardly ever see her in ranked compared to the usual suspects like Drag, Feng and Devil Jin.
            you hardly saw Akuma in ranked T7 either, i guess he sucked
    It's just flavor of the month bullshit. Right now everyone's attention, including bandwagon riders who don't even understand the game mechanics, is on her because high profile players are criticizing her. Next month it will be some other character, then some other character.

She will probably get her nerf. Hopefully that will make people shut up so we can go back to playing her in peace.
        I agree people are taking it further than Knee was asking for but you can't honestly, in good faith, look at Ling ducking under some of the lowest hitting mids in the game or her avoiding tracking lows with SS AOP and say yeah there's no problem with that.
            Probably not - I'm not a Tekken expert, so I don't know. But what I am noticing is that people are now calling her 'brain dead', 'autopilot character' and other stuff that clearly doesn't apply. By all means, nerf her more unfair aspects, but don't nuke her just because you dislike the matchup.
    She is broken in this game and will get nerfed. See PhiDX’s recent video.
    Nobody likes gimmick characters to be top tier just accept it. They're way too hard to deal with compared to fundamental (drag, djin) and hybrid (feng) top tier characters. Gimmick characters already destroying people in online, so its not a real concern for a lot of people if their character can make it to tournament or not.
    People have been complaining about T7 Feng and had been nerfed tho?
        Nothing Nerfed about Feng in T7 or T8. The nerfs they did give him in T7 was so minuscule it didn't change anything.
Based 

But yeah people should stop complaining about mechanic that was there for 10+ years. Xiaoyu needs nerfs but not to AOP
Don't people comment this typa shit every day
I don't follow the proscene, is knee like a big deal?
    The worst he’s been in the past 20 years is the 2nd best player in the world, and spent most of it as the best in the world. Basically mains the whole cast and has them all at Tekken God Omega rank so it’s hilarious to tell him to learn the matchup like this
        pft, okay i see
hehehehehe.
I can't bwlive its controversial to say that a fighting game character shouldn't be literally unhittable.
Also the fact that he reacts that under a video showing ling going under some of the lowest hitting mids in the game lmao. Not a single character gets to do that, some barely have any evasion at all.
Did he just tell one of the best tekken players in the world to... git gud?
What's the point of this post? To shit on guy telling knee to figure stuff out? Lol
This may be a hot take, but I kinda wish Knee would shut up for a while.  Like I'm not going to defend someone who's response to Xiaoyu critique is "learn the matchup" because... come on... but also, Knee was saying one week that Jun was the first completely broken character in the game but by the following week she wasn't in his top 5.  I respect Knee's accomplishments and obviously he's a much more talented and knowledgeable player than I am, but it's precisely because he's so well respected I wish he'd take a little longer before voicing his opinions publicly.
    jun got nerfed between the tweet and his top 5 statement
    She got two major nerfs in the very first patch???
    Jun can be strong without being in the top 5. Not sure why that's mutually exclusive? These 5 characters can be stronger than Jun.

His take here is reasonable and he backs it up with evidence. If all you guys can do is shit on him and look up past takes to discount the current opinion, then that's bad form bro.
        But saying she's "literally the best character so much that she absolutely requires a nerf" and "she's not in the top 5" are mutually exclusive.  Game is too young and there are too many variables for even the best players to be throwing out "nerf this or that" opinions. That's what I'm saying.
            Did you just conveniently ignore the other guy that already told you that Jun was nerfed between the statement and the tier list?
                She wasn't nerfed in the way that Knee was complaining though? She still has basically everything he initially complained about.
            Knee didn't say Jun was the best character, he said she was broken. She was one of the first characters to get nerfs too, the devs were definitely eyeballing her from day 1. Let's not pretend Knee's opinion on Jun was invalid as if she didn't immediately get hit by nerfs like Dragunov and Devil Jin did.
            When did he say Jun needs a nerf? He said she was strong and broken. Not that she needed a nerf. Not sure how this supports your argument. Btw Jun got nerfed between statements. 

He didn't say that she was the best character and he didn't say those words. His issue is specifically with aop duck causing alot of lows to whiff.

Also, Xiaoyu specialists are washing both Knee and Arslan 3-0 when they were handily beating her 0-3 a few months back in tournaments. Tekken is a legacy game man. If things change that much that the top 2 best players in tekken struggle versus them then surely it's an issue.

How long do you actually wanna wait before anyone can say anything about balance? People called JP OP from the beginning and I saw many people say similar things to you lol. Look, JP got nerfed.
He is correct about one thing: if Knee thinks Xiaoyu is so good, he should main her and win some tournaments. Easy money, right?
Based. Knee, learn the matchup.
    Isn't he at the practice mode "learning the matchup"...
Ngl I like the energy
Isn't it obvious what Bandai is doing they want to lift the power scaling of characters regardless of how ridiculous it makes characters so they can sell ridiculously unbalanced DLC in the hope no body notices with all the stupid shit that's in T8.
This is so ignorant it's actually hilarious, only way to read this is ironically.
I mean, I can’t respect a Feng player complaining about Xiaoyu.
    People calling knee a Feng player like he doesn't just pick a top tier when he wants to win..
    This guy is a better Ling player than almost all of them.
        Sorry hun, I just wanted to make a joke about Feng
            [deleted]
                i'm sorry i insulted ur fave bb, i dont think he'll notice u tho
        Says a lot that he chose Feng over her lol
    Why is this so downvoted lol, it's true. I know he plays both but holy shit Feng is strong.
        because there are a lot of feng player man idk lol. i play jun right now, i can accept that thing is broken.
            I mained Xiao from day one because she was one of the least played characters on release week and I had no idea she was that strong so I wont defend her either.

I started playing Jun yesterday and she's amazing.
mans out here crying instead of learning the matchup
Had to be a young kid trolling
he’s right tho yall b ruining video games with ur fuckin patcher tears
    damn that's crazy bro
        imagine being so shit you beg for a low tier to be nerfed 🤡
            ok
nerf criers even worse then pluggers they basically tryna plug a whole character out of the game
He’s not wrong. Xiaoyu is in the game and her AoP is here to stay. The best you can do is know your characters move that can consistently hit her in that stance. Usually characters with a generic df4 low kick is fine
    That’s why he’s complaining… certain lows phase through Xiaoyu’s AoP stance if you SSR correctly. It’s a bug and it’s def gonna be patched
        If it’s a bug then that’s different. No where does this post say that though. But generally what I said still holds true. You should still find your characters move that hits her out of it
not a big fan of knee but xioayu is an absolute nightmare matchup for me Namco just delete that character already along with Yoshimitsu who I can barely fkn tell what he's doing half the time and his 150+ moves and nerf Dragonuv some more and JUn as well plz
She’s not even busted, she’s just ok
People do stupid things for clout
Honestly haven't used much Ling in TK8, she just felt way too juiced.  
I feel like some nerfs will even her out, she's always been a difficult character to balance.
HELLA SCRUPMAN
Gitgud knee
This post reminded me of a story about the composer Bach, when a man on his city council said they had to be content with the mediocre Bach in charge of the city orchestra
That’s why I never listen to people with that argument. Is like a kid’s response.
Yeah nobody should be crying when you have people playing hwoarang with a kick in you’re face 24/7
"Spoiled baby"
No wait, so you're telling me my Xiaoyu is the OP character this round O\_O?
This is like that woman who tried to explain the bible to the pope
Tekken community at its finest.
My guys, the dude has a league of legends avatar on Twitter. The only course of action would have been to disregard his comment, minimize, and block him. 

He really did not need the exposure for saying something so damn stupid.
Is this Knee guy a super good Tekken player? Sounds like it from the comments but I still wanted to check
    Been known as the "God of all Tekken".  Is in contention for the greatest Tekken player of all time, Got every character in the T7 roster to the highest rank.

&#x200B;

Yeah he's pretty damn good
*sees League profpic


opinion denied.
Ah yes, scrubs telling pros to git gud. Never gets old.
Don't ask me why I know, but his profile pic is from League of Legends I'm pretty sure, so that's another reason to ignore his opinion.
If she was really broken, wouldnt she be used a whole lot more?
And again this dude is nothing he means nothing only hater who is shittalking in internet not a pro player or tournament player
This made me laugh😂
I dont know either of those cunts
It's funny that they have a league of legends player icon, makes sense why they're acting like this lol.
This man needs to get destroyed
Some other guy in same thread called Knee a "Caren of Tekken"
phidx did a video on knees problems with ling pretty vaild imo
I'm so glad xiaoyu isn't more popular. I'm at blue ranks now and I've encountered maybe 3 xiaoyus so far. I haven't even started learning the match up yet. 

My strategy thus far for facing her is applying endless pressure and pray she doesn't get a chance to start her offense.
Who’s this guy knee ? Is he a pro competitor who won some tournaments or content creator ?
    He is undoubtedly in the top 2 of greatest tekken players of all time.
        O shit. He still compete ?
            Yea he still competes. For a long time he was for sure #1 but a Pakistani player named arslan ash showed up and literally owned tekken 7. He beat Knee multiple times in tournaments as well.
This like telling Faker to just learn the K'sante matchup lol
Just the beginning, many legacy players are going to have huge problems with the game.
It's like the average Joe complaints to Verstappen about driving a car
Can someone translate what Knee was saying please?
Knee is right, AOP just seemed OP af when I started considering I’ve played plenty tekken over the years, there was just something so different it’s like you couldn’t even hit her which meant you could really only do mids and lows(one of them will get parried btw), let’s not forget the launches she can catch you with or counter hit for massive amounts of dmg. The hitbox for it is way too low imo , I experienced this on day 1 launch
I mean he’s not lying
For what it's worth, I think tekken 8 has been hella balanced from the get-go. Generally speaking ofcourse lol I am curious to see what they will do about this, though. Idk why I just have a feeling they're going to approach the issue differently than just allowing more lows to connect. Regardless, this is definitely the first complex issue where a quick adjustment isn't obvious.
What a 1st kyu.
Imagine knee Playing xiaoyu against this guy bro would change his opinion Real Fast 💀
Isn't Xiaoyu one of the least picked characters in pick rate according to stats, damn near Panda?
Professional crying when he cant addapt to the New game guy in the comment is right stop crying and learn the Matchup
That big shadow of his probably kept him living in the dark for so long. He probably doesn't even know who he's talking to.
Knee the guy that got carried by feng suddenly worries about balancing
Morale of the Story: Stop Bitching & Hit The Lab
Someone better show the clip of Knee having Tekken God Prime with all characters
    \*Omega
    What a casual, only tekken god prime
Those Arabic letters make me think he could probably beat knee in a first to 10 lol
    Yep this post is a nonsense)
    What are you even implying? Did you think Pakistanis speak Arabic?
        Now implying that there's a decent amount of soft people in the comments. Chill. Go back to complaining about Tekken characters while you abuse your own character.
            Lmao way to deflect from your racism and geographic retardedness
                Damn you caught me. How'd you know.
                    I'll hand it to you, you're owning your retardedness really well.
                        Damn how'd you know that too?
                            Thank you for being the adult one here :)

The argument about Arabic letters makes no sense, true, and all tekken players get salty about match ups and prideful about many silly excuses in an attempt to deal with the anguish of not knowing how to get good quickly and consistently in a short amount of time, which is impossible.

You win and stay cool 😎.

(although you started the aggression a bit lol 😂)
                                By the way, what's happening is that Knee is sharing solid mechanical insights, given all the characteristics of all characters,, Xiaoyu's AOP is a bit OP.

It's good to hear and know this. A. She limits your options in a match when abused. B. The healthy response would be abusing your mains strong ssr catching mid.

Healthy talk yall chillll
                                It was pretty easy to tell where the guy was going with his first reply.
            [deleted]
                Yeah man
    World champion gets but fucked by 12 year old Pakistani child
He can’t)
    Knee could 100-0 your main with Mokujin.
        Sure kid, ur Knee is typically picking the strongest/broken chars. He can’t play X or Lei, for that u can look at Arslan)))
            Knee is actually one of the few top tier players that DOESN'T 100% tier whore the top 2 picks all the time.
            Bro doesn’t watch competitive tekken at all lmao
                He is a legend yes, but he can’t play Ling and never will.
                    He can beat probably 99.99% of Tekken players with basic tools. 

Arslan is part of that .01%, obviously and they're also not ever going to be in a situation where Knee is not picking his mains. 

Knee is the Michael Jordan of Tekken. Arslan Ash is LeBron. He doesn't even have to try to beat some equivalent of a college walk-on just like Jordan would absolutely dumpster 6,999,999,900 if the 7 billion people in the world and the 100 or so he wouldn't, he would still usually beat, he would just have to extend effort to do so
                        Yes I’m
Totally agreed with u, thx for it, but I’m sure that Knee will never pick Ling at tournaments, that’s my position, and if he does and win I will eat my hat)))
                            That's not what you said. 

You said Knee can't play Ling. That is false. He can play Ling better than most people can play Tekken. He could likely enter tournaments with Ling and still make Top 16 but why would he put himself at a disadvantage like that?
                                Competitively? No and another no) He did that for fun and abuse Sodam unsafe style and his knowledge of matchup)
                                He is billing Sodam again with broken king not Ling))

https://youtu.be/An-3NlmCIvY?si=FkE4riRFM9nq3fNE
                    He already has my guy. He made it to top rank with Ling.
                        I have seen Arslan training with Ling, do you have a proof about Knee? I have seen all Lings on YouTube since T3)))
                            https://www.reddit.com/r/Tekken/s/fKQ3MNtnZf

Knee made it to the highest rank (Tekken God Omega) with every single character in Tekken 7, I think it's fair to say he knows how to play Ling.
            lol he beat the crap out of mainman with kazuya, mainman's main for years.
        😂😂😂
Me on my way to telling the most accomplished tekken player in history to go practice more 🤡
    So did Arslan listen to your advice and practice more?
        Arslan is undoubtedly the best player on earth, but accomplished? Knee takes that.
            Nobody beats Knee when it comes to Tekken as a whole. I’m sure Arslan would be amazing in previous games as well but Knee JDCR Qudans, these guys dominated Tekken from the get go and were in the spotlight. 

I’d never deny Arslan wouldn’t be a god in previous games but since we haven’t seen him then. I’m gonna put my money on Knee being the greatest player across the entire tekken competitive life.
        Did we just forget Knee's history of Tekken prior to Tekken 7?
            Nah. Arslan still the GOAT
                If he keeps dominating Tekken 8, you could make that case. Until then it's Knee.
                dominating for the last years doesnt make you the GOAT, even then Knee won a Evo final against him so its not like its full on domination.
                    Arslan is the GOAT just be the peak alone. Knee has never been as dominant as Arslan was during the end half of T7. He showed up out of  no where and dominated the whole scene for 4 years in a row. I know Knee has been near the top since Tekken5 but he has never peaked quite like Arslan did AND the scene during T7 was way more competitive than before T7.
                        even Arslan lost a EVO final during his "peak" against Knee. besides Arslan still has to prove himself on anything else other than Tekken 7. Knee been on top for several games for two decades.
Is arslan the Tekken 7 GOAT? sure.
                            Knee won Khan in the EVO finals, not Arslan. But indeed we seem to disagree on what makes somebody the GOAT. I absolutely love Knee and always root for him (unless he is playing against JDCR) and I hope he can claim his title back with Tekken8
        knee been on top since 2005, he might not be the current best but he is the most accomplished one by a mile.
    Least oppressive Asian parent be like:
This is what everyone says when anyone complains about any character in this game. Knee, git gud and stop being a scrub /s
i dont think you remember rangchu winning twt because the best pro tekken players genuinely didnt know the matchup
    Rangchu is fucking good as fuck. It's not just that the best players didn't know the matchup, it's more that it's hard to find someone at his level to train against.

Playing a bear does come with perks like being a southpaw, but Rangchu routinely beats top players from Japan and Korea.
        It was absolutely awesome to watch Qudans and Knee try to punish Panda's ff2(?) time after time with different buttons and never have any success at it. TWT 2018 was something else
            Especially since Devil Jin has a very strong punish to that move, better than the rest of the roster at the time
        Also even if some wins were due to matchup knowledge that's just because panda is a low priority matchup to learn, that isn't the case with a high tier like xiaoyu, knee is actively trying to figure her out and failing to do so
            In the case of TWT Finals that doesn't fly. All 19 finalists were decided a month before Finals (and some were already guaranteed a spot almost 2 months in advance). So its basic due diligence to study and prepare for every other finalist. The only wildcard is the LCQ winner.



Also Knee and Qudans had faced Rangchu's Panda multiple times throughout the 2018 TWT and beaten him every time they crossed paths. So its more likely they felt confident in their tactics against him. What made the difference was that Rangchu explained he would train the Devil Jin matchup with LowHigh for up to something like 8 hours a day. Since they had the same sponsor at the time. Rangchu had impeccable timing on when Qudans would go for hellsweep and Qudans kept fucking up the punish for bear ff2 (which was identical to Hei ff2). Also Knee had practically already won against Rangchu in LF. Dude just dropped the killing combo and Rangchu did not let that chance slip.



At that level of play, those are the type of things that are more important factors for winning. Reducing it to "low priority bear matchup" dismisses the effort Rangchu put in. You can't bank on trying to blindside the best players using the strongest characters with knowledge checks at Finals. You can take advantage of slip-ups (Knee's one-in-a-million combo drop) or failure to adapt (Qudans not using an easier consistent punish) sure but those aren't things you rely on as a winning strategy.
                Thank you, at least not everyone is a gaslighter around here.
                At a high level comfort in a matchup is similar to matchup knowledge too though. If you have the knowledge on how to deal with a character but then your also fighting a player of a high skill level recalling that info when you don't have to use it often while your mental stack is so high leads to mistakes like not punishing properly and being slower to react to stuff.
        Wdym bears have both arms forward at the same time lol. They are both southpaw and orthodox at the same time
    Panda is not ling tho. Panda seen way less often than ling.
Oh no, how dare someone tell an ordinary person (Because he's just a streamer dude, why you yanking at him), to learn the matchup.

Apparently Knee is the almighty and powerful. No one is allowed to tell him anything. or a wave of his fans will come and start acting like 15 year old fan girls squealing over Taylor Swift.
    You're overthinking it. The point isn't that Knee is beyond reproach, it's simply that he obviously already knows the matchup.
    The irony is that this guy is telling the player that probably knows the matchup against xiaoyu better than anyone else in the world, to learn the matchup. 
        I'd bet Knee smokes that random tweeter if he played Xiaoyu and limited himself to 2 buttons.
    You guys take this in such a weird direction all the time.

Knee has plenty of Xiaoyu experience (He had her in Tekken God Omega in T7) and he frequently scrims with Sodam, one of the oldest and most well-known Xiaoyu specialists who pioneered many of her tech and setups still in-use today.

Knee knows the matchup. Saying he doesn't is disingenuous. It's nothing like he's 'all-powerful' it's just factual. Not sure why you or twitter users have an issue with this.

Even Arslan has Xiaoyu in his top 5. Why are you so pressed little guy?
    You're right. Xiaoyu is perfectly balanced. So is Zafina. No buffs needed. 

🙄
    Nice trolling
its definitely a joke / troll post
He told him that because the dumb ass response to anyone talking about character balance is to assume they are just complaining and don't know the matchup despite people saying that to people they don't know the skill level of.  


This is never a counter argument even if Knee wasn't one of the best most knowledgeable players . If you think someone doesn't know the matchup you show them proof they are wrong but these Ling players couldn't do that because Knee knows the game better than all of them and he meant exactly what he said and had the facts to back it up.  


Every single comment that tried to argue against him was just people ignoring the facts or providing evidence that didn't disprove knees point. Like being dishonest about her move having the same evasiveness in all past Tekkens which was literally just them lying.  


This whole thing just showed me that the "GIT GOOD" crowd usually just say that because they are snowflakes and thats the way they found to respond to shit they don't like to hear.
Shut up hella scrupman
    😂
    *WASTED*
    Fuck man, you got me 😂🤣
no, he complains about Xiaoyu's kit being overloaded: AoP duck, side step AoP duck and Hipnotist 2 being +5 on block. In short, you cant press into Xiaoyu but you also can't play defensively.
    Xiaoyu's evasion wouldn't be such a problem if she also didn't have stupidly high damage when she's traditionally been a low damage character.


Coupled with her great oki and the extremely strong hipnotist mixup during heat tips it over the top.
        Facts. She has insane evasion coupled with her offense being really good this time around and really good damage.

Xiaoyu kills you whether you attack or defend. Like release Leroy.
            Release leroy was basically a T8 character in T7, X is just playing T8 along with her usual stance bullshit which might be too much/op idk 90% of the cast seems overtuned to me.
                No, Tekken 8 characters are juiced but release Leroy was a different beast lol. I played him quite a bit on release and basically the main problems were:

* 1,1 ch jab string dealing 50 damage and wall splatting
* ff3 being homing, + on block and launching on hit - basically an electric
* df1 being -1 AND having followups, something that was unique to Heihachi, making it insane paired with his ch tools
* Orbital being -3 on block - A mid low crushing launcher with the same frames as a df1 on block. You could sidestep and murder your opponent if they tried to press something after blocking orbital
* Cane being a long ranged mid launcher that was +8 on block, basically a second Rage Drive, and it also dealt like 50 damage before the combo so it was absolutely insane
* d2, delayed 4 combo ender making sure every combo of his did 85+ without a wall
* His wall combo with hermit 4 into floor punches dealing insane damage - like nearly 40 - and also floor breaking on forgotten realm, I did 140 damage combos on that stage without rage
* b2 parry and b1+2 mid i12 ch launcher being impossible to whiff punish

Even in Tekken 8 I don't think there's anyone as OP as release Leroy
                    I like how even listing out all these broken stuff you didn't even get to d1+2, the crazy long range, mid CH launcher, that forced crouching and was 0 on block.  Genuinely just one of the most spammable moves to ever be in Tekken.  Leroys at evo Japan would use this move for their entire neutral.
                        lmao shit I forgot that one, yeah that move was insane

I also just remembered one more, db1,1+2 second hit was a mid ch launcher and safe on block
                        Still crazy to me that Noroma made top8 with basically a Day 1 Leroy. Stream chat was losing their shit at how Noroma had no combos, but was still winning.
                    I suppose we'll see at evo lol. 

I agree there's def no one character as overloaded like he was on release but instead of just one character being absolutely bullshit now it feels like most of the cast is a mini leroy and I'm not sure if I like that any better.
                        Combo Breaker will be a good showcase of top players.
                        I think Dragunov comes kinda close, maybe Azucena too haha. Just about every character can snowball into unending pressure once they gain momentum, but Dragunov feels like he can force his momentum whenever he wants
                            No version of Drag comes close to Leroy lmao
                    What about fahk lol he was a different beast too
                    I remember through all of that dumb people just kept saying git good despite the character being clearly broken.
                The problem is her offense is good and leaves her at plus. This makes her access to aop and its variants easy. Her evasion is top tier and you can't retaliate.
        Straight up she wouldn't annoy me so much if I didn't feel like I was taking 50% every time she touched me.
        Also this is the first game where AOP duck can consistently dodge lows apparently
    The fact is that she has it all, best evasion, Hella good stance mixups a ton of damage and a ton of plus frame or negative in to high mid crush stance that makes you basically plus
Yep, pretty much. Knee even backs up his words and people still jump on him.
    yeah, people online/twitter cant seem to read or have low reading comprehension or just want to latch on something that "outrages" them
        It's specifically Ling mains that seem to be very emotionally charged over this discourse.
            Asked someone and they told me it's not fair because no one complains this much about Devil Jin
                That's the premier defense. The 'whataboutism'. Like "Well what bout Dragunov/Devil Jin/Feng?" etc etc.

It's crazy how you can't point anything out without some Ling main trying to direct the conversation away from Ling. So weird.
                    Its the Ling agenda lmao. Although to be fair alot of people do that when their main is a strong its not just Ling players.
                        I've seen the guy you're talking to on here also telling Knee to get good. Absolutely hilarious and delirious cunt that guy.
                            ikr xD. Ill never get people getting so defensive about their mains that they are willing to spread misinfo, gaslight and be nasty over a video game lmao.
                                I assure you, the guy in the screenshot and the guy you're talking to. Knee would fold the if they use Xiaoyu and he just jabbed.
    if he believes it's that strong that it should be nerfed while ignoring drag, he better pick her up and just win tourneys with her like he did with Feng.
        This is such an emotional response tantamounting to whataboutism. Dragunov doesn't have any stance that evades lows.

Not that that matters though lol.
            I dont know. I kind of agree with that guy. If he thinks Xiaoyu is so overloaded and that AOP duck is incredibly OP just play it and use it. That's his job if he's a professional player, no?
                There legit hasn't even been a big tourney until April? You guys need to relax lmao. Not sure why you talk like there's been 10 tournaments when there's hasn't been one (big) tourney.

Also, he can talk about strong things. He's more adept at sussing things out than random joe like in the screenshot. Nothing wrong with that. People seem personally offended that Knee said one thing in their favourite characters kit is overloaded. So weird.
                    You're acting like this is one comment Knee made about it. The screenshot in question is him doubling down, lol. People aren't personally offended, it's just he seems to go out of his way to talk about it more. Of course people are reacting to that, that's why it's here too.
                        Doubling down? He presented evidence to his claims. How is that doubling down. I didn't know substantiating your claims was doubling down. Jesus christ. You guys are really emotional.

Also, people are definitely personally offended. Look at this thread and look at how the guy reacted telling Knee to 'learn the matchup'.

Look at the twitter thread and tell me with a straight face people aren't personally offended.
                MKLeo in smash played Byleth, who was considered low tier at the time, because he liked the character. The dude won multiple tournaments with them to the point where people changed their minds about the character’s placement on a tier list. There were multiple other characters at the time that were considered way more meta or broken than Byleth, but MKLeo thought Byleth was more fun and interesting to play. 

It’s the same concept here. Knee isn’t obligated to play the most broken character because she’s broken and that definitely doesn’t negate his very valid criticism.
                    Facts. People get weirdly emotional about Xiaoyu for some reason. Alot of whataboutism and personal attacks (learn the match up to knee lol).
                        Yeah I’ve watched a couple videos summarizing what people are saying (because I don’t have enough free time to constantly monitor what Twitter is saying lol) and X mains definitely seem to be upset because their character got called out.

I mean, I get it. If Zafina was this broken then I’d be upset the top Tekken player was calling for nerfs too.
                            It sucks people can't separate themselves from their main. Dragunov for example, I don't deny he's top 5 and very strong and needs some tuning.

And yeah I watched PhiDx's video on it. Great summary and relatively neutral. And the X mains still gave him shit for it when his proposed nerfs was just nerfing her frame advantage on HYP2.
                    He's not obligated but I think "whining" or "criticism" depending on your perspective has a different color when you are a pro player as opposed to a mighty ruler guy playing from his couch on the weekends. 

It's fine to play what you like and think another character is strong but people endlessly ragged on lets say Speedkicks in T7 when he retired and said Akuma and etc. was too annoying to deal with but he wanted to stick with Hwo, he didn't want to play them. 

It's just kind of "want your cake and eat it too" as a professional to complain but also want to win doing your own way. As a professional your job is to win, so you should play what you personally think gives you the best chance to win. That's kind of exclusive with saying "XYZ character has too many tools and is extremely overbearing against the game" (not quoting him). It's eyeroll to tell Knee to "find the answers" but also, that is the correct generic response that people willingly use against others (accurately) when it suits them.
        Just because a character is broken doesn’t mean characters are obligated to play them lmao. If Knee had fun playing her then he would. That doesn’t mean he can’t criticize how broken she is.
thats not unique to tekken 8
I agree that she's broken, but I don't think she can actually duck lows in any situation.

She sidesteps every time she enters AOP, and some lows can be sidestepped. That can give the illusion that she "ducked" it because the ducking and sidestep animations play simultaneously.

That is still pretty broken though and I think might be what his complaint is really about. She literally has a button that evades highs and some lows simultaneously.

Even though she's not technically "ducking" the low, she *can* duck-react certain lows to evade them since the sidestep is automatic.

Maybe she can use the lower AOP duck to actually duck special lows though. I could see that, and that's super broken if no other character can do that lol
    [ive seen this tweet](https://i.imgur.com/eBjm3QU.mp4) which she already stopped the sidestepping animation and dodged hwoarangs low
        lol that's awesome

Is that kick a full on low or an s.low? Either way I can't decide which is more broken, Xiaoyu being able to duck it or Hwoarang even having that as an attack.

Man slightly adjusts his posture for 2 frames and that's a low hit somehow...probably one of those stupid kicks that cancels your guard too so he gets a guaranteed high+mid after it.
He’s pointed out how it’s kinda bs that side step right AOP also avoids moves that are supposed to “track” side stepping moves but he only really has a problem with AOP duck. I think that’s the general gist of things but at this point so many have chimed in that it’s hard to remember.
Bah, Arslan and Knee should just learn the matchup, they didn't cry about Zafina before, or their character Feng at some points.  

If they can't pick up and main a strong Xiaoyu then they should stop complaining.  

What's next? Jesandy's commenting on King or Speedkicks on Hwoarang? Bunch of total noobs if you ask me!
    i'm just saying, This\_Is\_The\_End never lost to Knee or Arslan...
        I haven't lost to them either, and I'm new to Tekken, so how good can they really be...?
            Probably just a bunch of circlejerks
Anybody telling Knee to learn the matchup is delusional lmao.
    While yes, also, no, in particular xiaoyu mains are delusional. Character is brain dead OP
We don't claim him
Maybe because she is one of the less popular characters for past 7 years and was low tier in t7 no one gave a fuck, no one played her in CBT and there are other broken, more popular tournament viable characters in the game. Yhere is a high chance that devs will overnerf her because of all that talking which will end up with another few years of Ling being irrelevant.

Just a guess.
    She is totally tournament viable this game lmao, she’s top 1. And she was not low tier last game. Solid mid tier during the last 3 seasons
Just like lei players fr
    Tf you mean Lei players he not even in the game anymore lol
        The Lei community used to tell everyone he was one of the hardest characters in the game. He’s basically just a labbing nightmare. When a community for a character is very small they tend to dictate the image of that character. Xiaoyu is similar to Lei in that aspect. People used to say she’s extremely hard to play and that she’s mid tier at best. As soon as people start saying she’s good and needs tuning down they all grab the pitch fork’s because they’re all delusional about their main.
            Damn you must have some serious Lei ptsd lol
                Nah, that’s just how that was for tekken 7. There’s literally nothing difficult about lei, just add more bullshit at the end of the last bullshit. The lei players were delusional for years about it. Same with xiaoyu players. Same with yoshi players. Same with Nina players, except after blue ranks, that character is actually hard as shit
                    Nina can bulldoze lower ranks that don't respect her plus frames or don't know how to step / duck some of her strings. However, the moment you hit a high-ish rank, the nightmare starts. You need to be extremely cracked to deal with players that know how to deal with Nina. It's not free neutral like Dragunov / Jun / Xiaoyu for example.
                    That's what I'm saying man, we're in T8. Mental scarring from tekken 7 is literally post-traumatic lol.
                        It’s just annoying to play block the 5 min string and low parry at the end into get the fuck off the floor with your opponent for 3 rounds.
                    Yoshi isn't difficult? Being in the same convo as Nina and Xiaoyu feels wrong lol
                        Yoshi is not difficult. And 10000% in the same category as Nina and ling
                            You just repeated what I said but as affirmative, idk why u think that tho
                                Best panic move in the game, broken move in general, easy combos, fucked range, “gimmicks” up the ass but really they’re good tools. Flash should be -25
            erm, when was Lei ever top tier?
            thats not even true, every lei main i ever saw on here would talk about how he appears hard at first but encouraged people to play him because with time spent he wasn't that difficult. this sub just wants any excuse to hate on lei. Some of you have such entitled behavior about different characters based on what you think the game should be like and it's really annoying.
he's also a lol player, judging from his pfp
To be fair, most Tekken players are.
    Wrong
Its like Faker complaining about K'sante and some random Silver player tells him to just learn the matchup 🤣🤣🤣
[You are fucking! No you are fucking!](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej45H8MMgfg)
More than this, it’s the evasion coupled with the damage output. See PhiDX’s recent video on this topic - he outlined all of the arguments.
    Omg when I say Bryan’s db2 getting evaded and zafinas df1 I was like nah this shit is wild, lili coudnt step it but xiayou can
        It’s actually broken.
    I still think people are being a little disingenuous though. 

Here guys look how OP she is when you add in a wall AND a stage bounce into the same combo. Almost like 70% of the cast couldn’t reach that damage. Hell I reached 130 damage with Paul using only a wall break, no stage bounce.

They didn’t show that she very literally has the lowest natural combo damage in the game though did they? Nope, because it doesn’t fit the agenda. 

I like PhiDX quite a lot, but it was pretty shitty to leave out that the combos that happen in 90% of situations are in fact trash damage compared to the rest of the cast. Instead shows a combo where the opponent hits the wall at a perfect time AND gets a stage bounce… yeah like no fucking shit ofc you can do some crazy stuff from that combo that might happen once every 100 games. 

Disingenuous!
Maybe he should learn the matchup and stop complaining like a scrub
The issue isn't that they are talking shit to knee. Its that they are objectively wrong and Knee is literally providing proof and they are still being stupid. If a green rank player pointed these things out they would still be correct.  


Its just doubly stupid this person responded to one of the best and most knowledgeable players that way.
I agree with this take. I don't understand how we went from "certain aspects of Xiao may be bugged or OP" to "she is a completely brain dead button mash character who breaks the game". People are taking Knee's relatively mild criticism of her and extrapolating it wildly.
    People are extrapolating it wildly because the character is very hated in general at all levels of play. I personally agree with the brain dead thing since if someone doesn't know your character you don't have to really work hard at all to just land stuff vs them so knowledge check characters will always have a brain dead element to them until you hit higher level play and even then some players will still not know the matchup.  


Since some people are making great points about what aspects of her are overtuned alot of people are using that to hop on the train and just air their frustrations about the character even if some of them aren't because she is broken its because they just don't know the matchup.
I hope they don't overnerf he as well. Her evasion should be toned down a bit but otherwise the char is fine. She's frustrating if you don't know the matchup for sure that will never change even with nerfs but her turn stealing is so good it enables the rest of her kit to be waaaaay more threatening than it should be.  


It would suck if they nerf the rest of her kit just to let her keep the evasion she has now.
I don’t think this is the main balance patch this was the bug fix I think that’s next balance patch where they will fix some of this stuff
    Please god before I lose my mind 😂
She totally carries the player in her current state. I’ve lost to several Xiaoyu players recently who had no business being the rank they were. 

It’s the evasion + damage output that makes her busted.
    >She totally carries the player in her current state.

This is a bit unfair. Why can't people criticize something without overcorrecting? She's probably OP, yes, but clearly it takes skill and practice to play her well. Her winrate sits at 45% currently. A lot of low level Ling players, myself included, get their teeth kicked in regularly.

I think she is OP once you know the ins and outs of her playstyle, but to get to that point takes a while.
        She carries the player because she has overly high damage and is characteristically evasive. She gets a launching throw into a full combo. She goes under a lot of lows (as outlined by PhiDX’s video).

It’s not difficult to understand. 

Her T7 form was fair because she conformed to Tekken rules.
            Yes, she is OP. That doesn't mean she 'carries' everyone who plays her. It still takes skill and practice. This is what I mean when I say people are overcorrecting. There is no happy middle ground between "character is OP, everyone who plays her is shit" and "character is fair, everyone who plays them is good". It's either one extreme or the other with this community.
                Reddit + Tekken (FGC, honestly). Don't expect too much when you come here.
            "Her T7 form was fair" 
Fucking lol.
I guess Xiao is only fair when she's bottom 5 huh
                Exactly.
                tbh with an archetype like hers they are usually Top 5 or Bottom 5 no inbetween. Very difficult to balance
        Any character that is obscure and allows you to breeze through matches you wouldn't otherwise because your opponent doesn't know the matchup. Your opponent not knowing your character does make the game easier for you so saying she carries people to an extent is just true. Its the case of any knowledge check heavy character.  


I say this as someone that in 7 played many characters including Xiaoyu and i played her when i was much much worse at the game and she was one of the easiest chars for me to win with vs players far above my skill level.
            There is a difference between saying a character carries a player to an extent and that they 'totally carry them'.

And the whole thing about not knowing the matchup applies to all characters. Do you think I know King's throws, Hwoarang's barrage of kicks or Yoshimitsu's shenanigans as a beginner?

Lastly, to even be able to play Xiao at a level where her stance play truly confuses opponents and make for a knowledge check, you need lots and lots of practice. A Xiao noob is just as likely to K.O. themselves as they are their opponent, because of how vulnerable her stances make her.

So while I respect your experience, I respectfully disagree.
                It doesn't equally apply to all characters because some characters knowledge checks are easier to figure out OR are less rewarding even when your opponent doesn't understand them.  


The idea that Ling's stances make her vulnerable especially at lower to mid level play is blatantly dishonest considering the stance is highly evasive and the moves that can hit it are not as rewarding AND require specific knowledge to check that Ling can counter even if they have that knowledge. If i enter AOP vs the vast majority of players i don't even have to know how AOP works and my opponent will just miss because they don't know how to counter AOP. The idea that you need to alot of practice when they literally can't hit you without doing a very very limited set of moves they are unlikely to pick because they don't know is disingenuous at best. If they don't know they don't know and the only thing you need to practice is "how to enter AOP"  


You are right though that saying that they "totally carry them" is different. But as someone who plays MANY characters. Some characters are just MUCH MUCH easier to win with when your opponent doesn't know the char and its not at all equivalent across all chars.   


You only need alot of practice to use Ling's stance vs people that know the matchup. Its funny that you bring up Yoshimitsu because what your saying about Xiao's stances is actually true for Yoshimitsu at least in tekken 7. His moves are so niche and weak and his knowledge checks require either the opponent to not attack (which is rare at low levels where hyper offense is incredibly common) and are not as rewarding AND can get you clipped if misused.
https://youtu.be/gnfOW6d09lE?si=QYovAyaBQvrd01J7 aop is actually stonger now then it used to be
    It’s interesting seeing these guys talk about it bc 5 frames is all it takes for it to be a different game. 

I agree w speedkicks vs the remove low AoP bc that might fundamentally change the game for pros and high level but doesn’t make them useless in mid or lower level player hands.

Ngl though I’m no where close to being good enough for any of this to really effect my games outcome 😅
        ya i dont have horse in the race im pretty sure she is suppose to duck bryans shit and "fixing" this wont change it
            I'm pretty sure her ducking mids that are known to work against duck AOP and her straight up ducking lows is what needs fixing
People who think she is EZ mode will attempt to play her themselves only to realize that they can't, after which much of their argument falls flat.  
A lot of comments in one of MainManSWE's latest tirade videos against Ling actually tried to claim that "all you need to do to play Ling is to button mash". So while I respect Knee's knowledge, this is the level we are at with a lot of the criticism. It's just empty parroting, as you say.

Watch both of us get downvoted to oblivion for pointing it out though.

The best we can hope for now are some moderate nerfs to her more annoying/OP moves (which do exist), after which we can hopefully be left alone by the howling chimpanzees.
    I recently picked up Xiaoyu because I've always been interested in the character, but I've never really liked playing a "top tier" in any game. (A bit early to claim top tiers imo, but thats where is on every list I've seen) And you're right. Pretending like Xiaoyu is a button mashing character is pretty absurd. She has so many stances and moves that will put you on a halt and if you don't learn what they do, you're not going anywhere.
To be fair, a stance that can go under lows is annoying as fuck to play against because it’s inconsistent. Having Xiaoyu dodge a low and then combo you is rage inducing. Especially when there’s a large probability it’s a bug.
    Honestly, I'm ok with some tweaks to what AOP~D can dodge, but that's not where the conversation has gone.  What started as "hey maybe AOP~D shouldn't dodge lows" has become "Ling is overpowered, ruining Tekken, and her HYP stance is too strong".  That's what's so damn frustrating to me right now.
If ling players cant win without her bein' broken then they dont deserve to have her at all
The top pros can definitely be wrong, but I don't think there is ever a circumstance where you can tell them to "learn the matchup." It's literally their job. They know the matchup.
Game has been out for a month
Knee is like a god in Pakistan.
    Astagfirknee bro
his name is in Arabic
    Doesn't necessarily mean he's Arab. Muslim people like to incorporate some Arabic in their life, this includes communities in Pakistan, Malaysia, etc
        My Arabic's rough, but I think it says "Owner of the Big Shadow". Also, that's the default League of Legends profile pic. And the aggressive, trolley energy ... 99.99% chance of Arab with a 0.01% chance of SE Asian (Phillipino, Malaysian).

Source: 🡢🡠🡧🡣🡮🡢1️⃣
        it means he's most likely Arab instead of Pakistani
Or maybe, Knee is a normal person and it's okay to critise his playing.

Oh also, someone's location has no hand in this.
    Knee a normal person? 

Yeah Mike Tyson was a normal person too.

Both people are top 0.001 % in their field. That’s not normal at all. 
    You must be Beerus level of strength in Tekken if you think Knee is a normal guy lol.
        part of what makes the pros so sick is that they are just normal people. that's why we all have the potential to get there. he's one of us.

bootlicking a celebrity is why epstein's island could exist for so long.
            Being at the top of any respective field would actually make you abnormal. Not many people can be considered the best, Knee has consistently for many years been considered the best/one of the best so he's in fact not normal. Messi, Mike Tyson, Michael Phelps, Usain Bolt etc are at the top of the food chain in what they do. Normal is whatever the most common rank in T8 is if you wanna get technical bro. Normal is most of the people that are reading and commenting on this thread. I have never won a major and neither have you, so I don't see how you get the idea these guys are the same as us when it comes to Tekken. Also, I'm not bootlicking anybody. I respect Knee and have been following him for years I don't see how we go from Tekken to Epstein's Island but hey, the snarky comment really added to this conversation! Thanks, all you gotta do next is mention a current event and a politician to really derail this convo. I'd love to hear more bro. Really! Keep going! 🫵🏾😂
                [see emoji at the end of wall of text]

[downvote and move on without reading]

LOL
    I agree with your second point but Knee is not just a normal person lol he was arguably top 2 in the world for like 18 years
    Criticizing his playing, is at best, dodgy. Yes obviously you'll find the odd mistake in his playing, but it'd be like the guy that plays football on the weekends with his mates trying to tell Messi to get good and do better. Knee is one of the GOATs of Tekken, and while not infallible, his word should always have strong weight attached to it purely due to his raw experience and skill.
arslan also voiced out about ling being op btw
Hmmm? She's in the same situation as she was in Tekken 7 during it's initial release, top 3.
    She got absolutely fucking killed in s2
yeah, why cant she have totally overtuned evasion plus ridiculous combo damage (with spike into unscaled ground hit) plus a -12, homing, unseeable low launcher that can be mixed with a +5 on block mid? i dont see the issue either...
    If you get hit by the fully charged Launcher that is on you. She needs to charge it for the launcher, so if you don't interupt her that's your mistake. The real mix is the knockdown in HEAT since it's instant. Also like I said. If shes so strong just play her and win. But you hardly ever see her in ranked compared to the usual suspects like Drag, Feng and Devil Jin.
        you hardly saw Akuma in ranked T7 either, i guess he sucked
It's just flavor of the month bullshit. Right now everyone's attention, including bandwagon riders who don't even understand the game mechanics, is on her because high profile players are criticizing her. Next month it will be some other character, then some other character.

She will probably get her nerf. Hopefully that will make people shut up so we can go back to playing her in peace.
    I agree people are taking it further than Knee was asking for but you can't honestly, in good faith, look at Ling ducking under some of the lowest hitting mids in the game or her avoiding tracking lows with SS AOP and say yeah there's no problem with that.
        Probably not - I'm not a Tekken expert, so I don't know. But what I am noticing is that people are now calling her 'brain dead', 'autopilot character' and other stuff that clearly doesn't apply. By all means, nerf her more unfair aspects, but don't nuke her just because you dislike the matchup.
She is broken in this game and will get nerfed. See PhiDX’s recent video.
Nobody likes gimmick characters to be top tier just accept it. They're way too hard to deal with compared to fundamental (drag, djin) and hybrid (feng) top tier characters. Gimmick characters already destroying people in online, so its not a real concern for a lot of people if their character can make it to tournament or not.
People have been complaining about T7 Feng and had been nerfed tho?
    Nothing Nerfed about Feng in T7 or T8. The nerfs they did give him in T7 was so minuscule it didn't change anything.
The worst he’s been in the past 20 years is the 2nd best player in the world, and spent most of it as the best in the world. Basically mains the whole cast and has them all at Tekken God Omega rank so it’s hilarious to tell him to learn the matchup like this
    pft, okay i see
jun got nerfed between the tweet and his top 5 statement
She got two major nerfs in the very first patch???
Jun can be strong without being in the top 5. Not sure why that's mutually exclusive? These 5 characters can be stronger than Jun.

His take here is reasonable and he backs it up with evidence. If all you guys can do is shit on him and look up past takes to discount the current opinion, then that's bad form bro.
    But saying she's "literally the best character so much that she absolutely requires a nerf" and "she's not in the top 5" are mutually exclusive.  Game is too young and there are too many variables for even the best players to be throwing out "nerf this or that" opinions. That's what I'm saying.
        Did you just conveniently ignore the other guy that already told you that Jun was nerfed between the statement and the tier list?
            She wasn't nerfed in the way that Knee was complaining though? She still has basically everything he initially complained about.
        Knee didn't say Jun was the best character, he said she was broken. She was one of the first characters to get nerfs too, the devs were definitely eyeballing her from day 1. Let's not pretend Knee's opinion on Jun was invalid as if she didn't immediately get hit by nerfs like Dragunov and Devil Jin did.
        When did he say Jun needs a nerf? He said she was strong and broken. Not that she needed a nerf. Not sure how this supports your argument. Btw Jun got nerfed between statements. 

He didn't say that she was the best character and he didn't say those words. His issue is specifically with aop duck causing alot of lows to whiff.

Also, Xiaoyu specialists are washing both Knee and Arslan 3-0 when they were handily beating her 0-3 a few months back in tournaments. Tekken is a legacy game man. If things change that much that the top 2 best players in tekken struggle versus them then surely it's an issue.

How long do you actually wanna wait before anyone can say anything about balance? People called JP OP from the beginning and I saw many people say similar things to you lol. Look, JP got nerfed.
Isn't he at the practice mode "learning the matchup"...
People calling knee a Feng player like he doesn't just pick a top tier when he wants to win..
This guy is a better Ling player than almost all of them.
    Sorry hun, I just wanted to make a joke about Feng
        [deleted]
            i'm sorry i insulted ur fave bb, i dont think he'll notice u tho
    Says a lot that he chose Feng over her lol
Why is this so downvoted lol, it's true. I know he plays both but holy shit Feng is strong.
    because there are a lot of feng player man idk lol. i play jun right now, i can accept that thing is broken.
        I mained Xiao from day one because she was one of the least played characters on release week and I had no idea she was that strong so I wont defend her either.

I started playing Jun yesterday and she's amazing.
damn that's crazy bro
    imagine being so shit you beg for a low tier to be nerfed 🤡
        ok
That’s why he’s complaining… certain lows phase through Xiaoyu’s AoP stance if you SSR correctly. It’s a bug and it’s def gonna be patched
    If it’s a bug then that’s different. No where does this post say that though. But generally what I said still holds true. You should still find your characters move that hits her out of it
Been known as the "God of all Tekken".  Is in contention for the greatest Tekken player of all time, Got every character in the T7 roster to the highest rank.

&#x200B;

Yeah he's pretty damn good
He is undoubtedly in the top 2 of greatest tekken players of all time.
    O shit. He still compete ?
        Yea he still competes. For a long time he was for sure #1 but a Pakistani player named arslan ash showed up and literally owned tekken 7. He beat Knee multiple times in tournaments as well.
\*Omega
What a casual, only tekken god prime
Yep this post is a nonsense)
What are you even implying? Did you think Pakistanis speak Arabic?
    Now implying that there's a decent amount of soft people in the comments. Chill. Go back to complaining about Tekken characters while you abuse your own character.
        Lmao way to deflect from your racism and geographic retardedness
            Damn you caught me. How'd you know.
                I'll hand it to you, you're owning your retardedness really well.
                    Damn how'd you know that too?
                        Thank you for being the adult one here :)

The argument about Arabic letters makes no sense, true, and all tekken players get salty about match ups and prideful about many silly excuses in an attempt to deal with the anguish of not knowing how to get good quickly and consistently in a short amount of time, which is impossible.

You win and stay cool 😎.

(although you started the aggression a bit lol 😂)
                            By the way, what's happening is that Knee is sharing solid mechanical insights, given all the characteristics of all characters,, Xiaoyu's AOP is a bit OP.

It's good to hear and know this. A. She limits your options in a match when abused. B. The healthy response would be abusing your mains strong ssr catching mid.

Healthy talk yall chillll
                            It was pretty easy to tell where the guy was going with his first reply.
        [deleted]
            Yeah man
World champion gets but fucked by 12 year old Pakistani child
Knee could 100-0 your main with Mokujin.
    Sure kid, ur Knee is typically picking the strongest/broken chars. He can’t play X or Lei, for that u can look at Arslan)))
        Knee is actually one of the few top tier players that DOESN'T 100% tier whore the top 2 picks all the time.
        Bro doesn’t watch competitive tekken at all lmao
            He is a legend yes, but he can’t play Ling and never will.
                He can beat probably 99.99% of Tekken players with basic tools. 

Arslan is part of that .01%, obviously and they're also not ever going to be in a situation where Knee is not picking his mains. 

Knee is the Michael Jordan of Tekken. Arslan Ash is LeBron. He doesn't even have to try to beat some equivalent of a college walk-on just like Jordan would absolutely dumpster 6,999,999,900 if the 7 billion people in the world and the 100 or so he wouldn't, he would still usually beat, he would just have to extend effort to do so
                    Yes I’m
Totally agreed with u, thx for it, but I’m sure that Knee will never pick Ling at tournaments, that’s my position, and if he does and win I will eat my hat)))
                        That's not what you said. 

You said Knee can't play Ling. That is false. He can play Ling better than most people can play Tekken. He could likely enter tournaments with Ling and still make Top 16 but why would he put himself at a disadvantage like that?
                            Competitively? No and another no) He did that for fun and abuse Sodam unsafe style and his knowledge of matchup)
                            He is billing Sodam again with broken king not Ling))

https://youtu.be/An-3NlmCIvY?si=FkE4riRFM9nq3fNE
                He already has my guy. He made it to top rank with Ling.
                    I have seen Arslan training with Ling, do you have a proof about Knee? I have seen all Lings on YouTube since T3)))
                        https://www.reddit.com/r/Tekken/s/fKQ3MNtnZf

Knee made it to the highest rank (Tekken God Omega) with every single character in Tekken 7, I think it's fair to say he knows how to play Ling.
        lol he beat the crap out of mainman with kazuya, mainman's main for years.
    😂😂😂
So did Arslan listen to your advice and practice more?
    Arslan is undoubtedly the best player on earth, but accomplished? Knee takes that.
        Nobody beats Knee when it comes to Tekken as a whole. I’m sure Arslan would be amazing in previous games as well but Knee JDCR Qudans, these guys dominated Tekken from the get go and were in the spotlight. 

I’d never deny Arslan wouldn’t be a god in previous games but since we haven’t seen him then. I’m gonna put my money on Knee being the greatest player across the entire tekken competitive life.
    Did we just forget Knee's history of Tekken prior to Tekken 7?
        Nah. Arslan still the GOAT
            If he keeps dominating Tekken 8, you could make that case. Until then it's Knee.
            dominating for the last years doesnt make you the GOAT, even then Knee won a Evo final against him so its not like its full on domination.
                Arslan is the GOAT just be the peak alone. Knee has never been as dominant as Arslan was during the end half of T7. He showed up out of  no where and dominated the whole scene for 4 years in a row. I know Knee has been near the top since Tekken5 but he has never peaked quite like Arslan did AND the scene during T7 was way more competitive than before T7.
                    even Arslan lost a EVO final during his "peak" against Knee. besides Arslan still has to prove himself on anything else other than Tekken 7. Knee been on top for several games for two decades.
Is arslan the Tekken 7 GOAT? sure.
                        Knee won Khan in the EVO finals, not Arslan. But indeed we seem to disagree on what makes somebody the GOAT. I absolutely love Knee and always root for him (unless he is playing against JDCR) and I hope he can claim his title back with Tekken8
    knee been on top since 2005, he might not be the current best but he is the most accomplished one by a mile.
Least oppressive Asian parent be like:
Rangchu is fucking good as fuck. It's not just that the best players didn't know the matchup, it's more that it's hard to find someone at his level to train against.

Playing a bear does come with perks like being a southpaw, but Rangchu routinely beats top players from Japan and Korea.
    It was absolutely awesome to watch Qudans and Knee try to punish Panda's ff2(?) time after time with different buttons and never have any success at it. TWT 2018 was something else
        Especially since Devil Jin has a very strong punish to that move, better than the rest of the roster at the time
    Also even if some wins were due to matchup knowledge that's just because panda is a low priority matchup to learn, that isn't the case with a high tier like xiaoyu, knee is actively trying to figure her out and failing to do so
        In the case of TWT Finals that doesn't fly. All 19 finalists were decided a month before Finals (and some were already guaranteed a spot almost 2 months in advance). So its basic due diligence to study and prepare for every other finalist. The only wildcard is the LCQ winner.



Also Knee and Qudans had faced Rangchu's Panda multiple times throughout the 2018 TWT and beaten him every time they crossed paths. So its more likely they felt confident in their tactics against him. What made the difference was that Rangchu explained he would train the Devil Jin matchup with LowHigh for up to something like 8 hours a day. Since they had the same sponsor at the time. Rangchu had impeccable timing on when Qudans would go for hellsweep and Qudans kept fucking up the punish for bear ff2 (which was identical to Hei ff2). Also Knee had practically already won against Rangchu in LF. Dude just dropped the killing combo and Rangchu did not let that chance slip.



At that level of play, those are the type of things that are more important factors for winning. Reducing it to "low priority bear matchup" dismisses the effort Rangchu put in. You can't bank on trying to blindside the best players using the strongest characters with knowledge checks at Finals. You can take advantage of slip-ups (Knee's one-in-a-million combo drop) or failure to adapt (Qudans not using an easier consistent punish) sure but those aren't things you rely on as a winning strategy.
            Thank you, at least not everyone is a gaslighter around here.
            At a high level comfort in a matchup is similar to matchup knowledge too though. If you have the knowledge on how to deal with a character but then your also fighting a player of a high skill level recalling that info when you don't have to use it often while your mental stack is so high leads to mistakes like not punishing properly and being slower to react to stuff.
    Wdym bears have both arms forward at the same time lol. They are both southpaw and orthodox at the same time
Panda is not ling tho. Panda seen way less often than ling.
You're overthinking it. The point isn't that Knee is beyond reproach, it's simply that he obviously already knows the matchup.
The irony is that this guy is telling the player that probably knows the matchup against xiaoyu better than anyone else in the world, to learn the matchup. 
    I'd bet Knee smokes that random tweeter if he played Xiaoyu and limited himself to 2 buttons.
You guys take this in such a weird direction all the time.

Knee has plenty of Xiaoyu experience (He had her in Tekken God Omega in T7) and he frequently scrims with Sodam, one of the oldest and most well-known Xiaoyu specialists who pioneered many of her tech and setups still in-use today.

Knee knows the matchup. Saying he doesn't is disingenuous. It's nothing like he's 'all-powerful' it's just factual. Not sure why you or twitter users have an issue with this.

Even Arslan has Xiaoyu in his top 5. Why are you so pressed little guy?
You're right. Xiaoyu is perfectly balanced. So is Zafina. No buffs needed. 

🙄
Nice trolling
😂
*WASTED*
Fuck man, you got me 😂🤣
Xiaoyu's evasion wouldn't be such a problem if she also didn't have stupidly high damage when she's traditionally been a low damage character.


Coupled with her great oki and the extremely strong hipnotist mixup during heat tips it over the top.
    Facts. She has insane evasion coupled with her offense being really good this time around and really good damage.

Xiaoyu kills you whether you attack or defend. Like release Leroy.
        Release leroy was basically a T8 character in T7, X is just playing T8 along with her usual stance bullshit which might be too much/op idk 90% of the cast seems overtuned to me.
            No, Tekken 8 characters are juiced but release Leroy was a different beast lol. I played him quite a bit on release and basically the main problems were:

* 1,1 ch jab string dealing 50 damage and wall splatting
* ff3 being homing, + on block and launching on hit - basically an electric
* df1 being -1 AND having followups, something that was unique to Heihachi, making it insane paired with his ch tools
* Orbital being -3 on block - A mid low crushing launcher with the same frames as a df1 on block. You could sidestep and murder your opponent if they tried to press something after blocking orbital
* Cane being a long ranged mid launcher that was +8 on block, basically a second Rage Drive, and it also dealt like 50 damage before the combo so it was absolutely insane
* d2, delayed 4 combo ender making sure every combo of his did 85+ without a wall
* His wall combo with hermit 4 into floor punches dealing insane damage - like nearly 40 - and also floor breaking on forgotten realm, I did 140 damage combos on that stage without rage
* b2 parry and b1+2 mid i12 ch launcher being impossible to whiff punish

Even in Tekken 8 I don't think there's anyone as OP as release Leroy
                I like how even listing out all these broken stuff you didn't even get to d1+2, the crazy long range, mid CH launcher, that forced crouching and was 0 on block.  Genuinely just one of the most spammable moves to ever be in Tekken.  Leroys at evo Japan would use this move for their entire neutral.
                    lmao shit I forgot that one, yeah that move was insane

I also just remembered one more, db1,1+2 second hit was a mid ch launcher and safe on block
                    Still crazy to me that Noroma made top8 with basically a Day 1 Leroy. Stream chat was losing their shit at how Noroma had no combos, but was still winning.
                I suppose we'll see at evo lol. 

I agree there's def no one character as overloaded like he was on release but instead of just one character being absolutely bullshit now it feels like most of the cast is a mini leroy and I'm not sure if I like that any better.
                    Combo Breaker will be a good showcase of top players.
                    I think Dragunov comes kinda close, maybe Azucena too haha. Just about every character can snowball into unending pressure once they gain momentum, but Dragunov feels like he can force his momentum whenever he wants
                        No version of Drag comes close to Leroy lmao
                What about fahk lol he was a different beast too
                I remember through all of that dumb people just kept saying git good despite the character being clearly broken.
            The problem is her offense is good and leaves her at plus. This makes her access to aop and its variants easy. Her evasion is top tier and you can't retaliate.
    Straight up she wouldn't annoy me so much if I didn't feel like I was taking 50% every time she touched me.
    Also this is the first game where AOP duck can consistently dodge lows apparently
The fact is that she has it all, best evasion, Hella good stance mixups a ton of damage and a ton of plus frame or negative in to high mid crush stance that makes you basically plus
yeah, people online/twitter cant seem to read or have low reading comprehension or just want to latch on something that "outrages" them
    It's specifically Ling mains that seem to be very emotionally charged over this discourse.
        Asked someone and they told me it's not fair because no one complains this much about Devil Jin
            That's the premier defense. The 'whataboutism'. Like "Well what bout Dragunov/Devil Jin/Feng?" etc etc.

It's crazy how you can't point anything out without some Ling main trying to direct the conversation away from Ling. So weird.
                Its the Ling agenda lmao. Although to be fair alot of people do that when their main is a strong its not just Ling players.
                    I've seen the guy you're talking to on here also telling Knee to get good. Absolutely hilarious and delirious cunt that guy.
                        ikr xD. Ill never get people getting so defensive about their mains that they are willing to spread misinfo, gaslight and be nasty over a video game lmao.
                            I assure you, the guy in the screenshot and the guy you're talking to. Knee would fold the if they use Xiaoyu and he just jabbed.
if he believes it's that strong that it should be nerfed while ignoring drag, he better pick her up and just win tourneys with her like he did with Feng.
    This is such an emotional response tantamounting to whataboutism. Dragunov doesn't have any stance that evades lows.

Not that that matters though lol.
        I dont know. I kind of agree with that guy. If he thinks Xiaoyu is so overloaded and that AOP duck is incredibly OP just play it and use it. That's his job if he's a professional player, no?
            There legit hasn't even been a big tourney until April? You guys need to relax lmao. Not sure why you talk like there's been 10 tournaments when there's hasn't been one (big) tourney.

Also, he can talk about strong things. He's more adept at sussing things out than random joe like in the screenshot. Nothing wrong with that. People seem personally offended that Knee said one thing in their favourite characters kit is overloaded. So weird.
                You're acting like this is one comment Knee made about it. The screenshot in question is him doubling down, lol. People aren't personally offended, it's just he seems to go out of his way to talk about it more. Of course people are reacting to that, that's why it's here too.
                    Doubling down? He presented evidence to his claims. How is that doubling down. I didn't know substantiating your claims was doubling down. Jesus christ. You guys are really emotional.

Also, people are definitely personally offended. Look at this thread and look at how the guy reacted telling Knee to 'learn the matchup'.

Look at the twitter thread and tell me with a straight face people aren't personally offended.
            MKLeo in smash played Byleth, who was considered low tier at the time, because he liked the character. The dude won multiple tournaments with them to the point where people changed their minds about the character’s placement on a tier list. There were multiple other characters at the time that were considered way more meta or broken than Byleth, but MKLeo thought Byleth was more fun and interesting to play. 

It’s the same concept here. Knee isn’t obligated to play the most broken character because she’s broken and that definitely doesn’t negate his very valid criticism.
                Facts. People get weirdly emotional about Xiaoyu for some reason. Alot of whataboutism and personal attacks (learn the match up to knee lol).
                    Yeah I’ve watched a couple videos summarizing what people are saying (because I don’t have enough free time to constantly monitor what Twitter is saying lol) and X mains definitely seem to be upset because their character got called out.

I mean, I get it. If Zafina was this broken then I’d be upset the top Tekken player was calling for nerfs too.
                        It sucks people can't separate themselves from their main. Dragunov for example, I don't deny he's top 5 and very strong and needs some tuning.

And yeah I watched PhiDx's video on it. Great summary and relatively neutral. And the X mains still gave him shit for it when his proposed nerfs was just nerfing her frame advantage on HYP2.
                He's not obligated but I think "whining" or "criticism" depending on your perspective has a different color when you are a pro player as opposed to a mighty ruler guy playing from his couch on the weekends. 

It's fine to play what you like and think another character is strong but people endlessly ragged on lets say Speedkicks in T7 when he retired and said Akuma and etc. was too annoying to deal with but he wanted to stick with Hwo, he didn't want to play them. 

It's just kind of "want your cake and eat it too" as a professional to complain but also want to win doing your own way. As a professional your job is to win, so you should play what you personally think gives you the best chance to win. That's kind of exclusive with saying "XYZ character has too many tools and is extremely overbearing against the game" (not quoting him). It's eyeroll to tell Knee to "find the answers" but also, that is the correct generic response that people willingly use against others (accurately) when it suits them.
    Just because a character is broken doesn’t mean characters are obligated to play them lmao. If Knee had fun playing her then he would. That doesn’t mean he can’t criticize how broken she is.
[ive seen this tweet](https://i.imgur.com/eBjm3QU.mp4) which she already stopped the sidestepping animation and dodged hwoarangs low
    lol that's awesome

Is that kick a full on low or an s.low? Either way I can't decide which is more broken, Xiaoyu being able to duck it or Hwoarang even having that as an attack.

Man slightly adjusts his posture for 2 frames and that's a low hit somehow...probably one of those stupid kicks that cancels your guard too so he gets a guaranteed high+mid after it.
i'm just saying, This\_Is\_The\_End never lost to Knee or Arslan...
    I haven't lost to them either, and I'm new to Tekken, so how good can they really be...?
        Probably just a bunch of circlejerks
While yes, also, no, in particular xiaoyu mains are delusional. Character is brain dead OP
She is totally tournament viable this game lmao, she’s top 1. And she was not low tier last game. Solid mid tier during the last 3 seasons
Tf you mean Lei players he not even in the game anymore lol
    The Lei community used to tell everyone he was one of the hardest characters in the game. He’s basically just a labbing nightmare. When a community for a character is very small they tend to dictate the image of that character. Xiaoyu is similar to Lei in that aspect. People used to say she’s extremely hard to play and that she’s mid tier at best. As soon as people start saying she’s good and needs tuning down they all grab the pitch fork’s because they’re all delusional about their main.
        Damn you must have some serious Lei ptsd lol
            Nah, that’s just how that was for tekken 7. There’s literally nothing difficult about lei, just add more bullshit at the end of the last bullshit. The lei players were delusional for years about it. Same with xiaoyu players. Same with yoshi players. Same with Nina players, except after blue ranks, that character is actually hard as shit
                Nina can bulldoze lower ranks that don't respect her plus frames or don't know how to step / duck some of her strings. However, the moment you hit a high-ish rank, the nightmare starts. You need to be extremely cracked to deal with players that know how to deal with Nina. It's not free neutral like Dragunov / Jun / Xiaoyu for example.
                That's what I'm saying man, we're in T8. Mental scarring from tekken 7 is literally post-traumatic lol.
                    It’s just annoying to play block the 5 min string and low parry at the end into get the fuck off the floor with your opponent for 3 rounds.
                Yoshi isn't difficult? Being in the same convo as Nina and Xiaoyu feels wrong lol
                    Yoshi is not difficult. And 10000% in the same category as Nina and ling
                        You just repeated what I said but as affirmative, idk why u think that tho
                            Best panic move in the game, broken move in general, easy combos, fucked range, “gimmicks” up the ass but really they’re good tools. Flash should be -25
        erm, when was Lei ever top tier?
        thats not even true, every lei main i ever saw on here would talk about how he appears hard at first but encouraged people to play him because with time spent he wasn't that difficult. this sub just wants any excuse to hate on lei. Some of you have such entitled behavior about different characters based on what you think the game should be like and it's really annoying.
Wrong
Omg when I say Bryan’s db2 getting evaded and zafinas df1 I was like nah this shit is wild, lili coudnt step it but xiayou can
    It’s actually broken.
I still think people are being a little disingenuous though. 

Here guys look how OP she is when you add in a wall AND a stage bounce into the same combo. Almost like 70% of the cast couldn’t reach that damage. Hell I reached 130 damage with Paul using only a wall break, no stage bounce.

They didn’t show that she very literally has the lowest natural combo damage in the game though did they? Nope, because it doesn’t fit the agenda. 

I like PhiDX quite a lot, but it was pretty shitty to leave out that the combos that happen in 90% of situations are in fact trash damage compared to the rest of the cast. Instead shows a combo where the opponent hits the wall at a perfect time AND gets a stage bounce… yeah like no fucking shit ofc you can do some crazy stuff from that combo that might happen once every 100 games. 

Disingenuous!
People are extrapolating it wildly because the character is very hated in general at all levels of play. I personally agree with the brain dead thing since if someone doesn't know your character you don't have to really work hard at all to just land stuff vs them so knowledge check characters will always have a brain dead element to them until you hit higher level play and even then some players will still not know the matchup.  


Since some people are making great points about what aspects of her are overtuned alot of people are using that to hop on the train and just air their frustrations about the character even if some of them aren't because she is broken its because they just don't know the matchup.
Please god before I lose my mind 😂
>She totally carries the player in her current state.

This is a bit unfair. Why can't people criticize something without overcorrecting? She's probably OP, yes, but clearly it takes skill and practice to play her well. Her winrate sits at 45% currently. A lot of low level Ling players, myself included, get their teeth kicked in regularly.

I think she is OP once you know the ins and outs of her playstyle, but to get to that point takes a while.
    She carries the player because she has overly high damage and is characteristically evasive. She gets a launching throw into a full combo. She goes under a lot of lows (as outlined by PhiDX’s video).

It’s not difficult to understand. 

Her T7 form was fair because she conformed to Tekken rules.
        Yes, she is OP. That doesn't mean she 'carries' everyone who plays her. It still takes skill and practice. This is what I mean when I say people are overcorrecting. There is no happy middle ground between "character is OP, everyone who plays her is shit" and "character is fair, everyone who plays them is good". It's either one extreme or the other with this community.
            Reddit + Tekken (FGC, honestly). Don't expect too much when you come here.
        "Her T7 form was fair" 
Fucking lol.
I guess Xiao is only fair when she's bottom 5 huh
            Exactly.
            tbh with an archetype like hers they are usually Top 5 or Bottom 5 no inbetween. Very difficult to balance
    Any character that is obscure and allows you to breeze through matches you wouldn't otherwise because your opponent doesn't know the matchup. Your opponent not knowing your character does make the game easier for you so saying she carries people to an extent is just true. Its the case of any knowledge check heavy character.  


I say this as someone that in 7 played many characters including Xiaoyu and i played her when i was much much worse at the game and she was one of the easiest chars for me to win with vs players far above my skill level.
        There is a difference between saying a character carries a player to an extent and that they 'totally carry them'.

And the whole thing about not knowing the matchup applies to all characters. Do you think I know King's throws, Hwoarang's barrage of kicks or Yoshimitsu's shenanigans as a beginner?

Lastly, to even be able to play Xiao at a level where her stance play truly confuses opponents and make for a knowledge check, you need lots and lots of practice. A Xiao noob is just as likely to K.O. themselves as they are their opponent, because of how vulnerable her stances make her.

So while I respect your experience, I respectfully disagree.
            It doesn't equally apply to all characters because some characters knowledge checks are easier to figure out OR are less rewarding even when your opponent doesn't understand them.  


The idea that Ling's stances make her vulnerable especially at lower to mid level play is blatantly dishonest considering the stance is highly evasive and the moves that can hit it are not as rewarding AND require specific knowledge to check that Ling can counter even if they have that knowledge. If i enter AOP vs the vast majority of players i don't even have to know how AOP works and my opponent will just miss because they don't know how to counter AOP. The idea that you need to alot of practice when they literally can't hit you without doing a very very limited set of moves they are unlikely to pick because they don't know is disingenuous at best. If they don't know they don't know and the only thing you need to practice is "how to enter AOP"  


You are right though that saying that they "totally carry them" is different. But as someone who plays MANY characters. Some characters are just MUCH MUCH easier to win with when your opponent doesn't know the char and its not at all equivalent across all chars.   


You only need alot of practice to use Ling's stance vs people that know the matchup. Its funny that you bring up Yoshimitsu because what your saying about Xiao's stances is actually true for Yoshimitsu at least in tekken 7. His moves are so niche and weak and his knowledge checks require either the opponent to not attack (which is rare at low levels where hyper offense is incredibly common) and are not as rewarding AND can get you clipped if misused.
It’s interesting seeing these guys talk about it bc 5 frames is all it takes for it to be a different game. 

I agree w speedkicks vs the remove low AoP bc that might fundamentally change the game for pros and high level but doesn’t make them useless in mid or lower level player hands.

Ngl though I’m no where close to being good enough for any of this to really effect my games outcome 😅
    ya i dont have horse in the race im pretty sure she is suppose to duck bryans shit and "fixing" this wont change it
        I'm pretty sure her ducking mids that are known to work against duck AOP and her straight up ducking lows is what needs fixing
I recently picked up Xiaoyu because I've always been interested in the character, but I've never really liked playing a "top tier" in any game. (A bit early to claim top tiers imo, but thats where is on every list I've seen) And you're right. Pretending like Xiaoyu is a button mashing character is pretty absurd. She has so many stances and moves that will put you on a halt and if you don't learn what they do, you're not going anywhere.
Honestly, I'm ok with some tweaks to what AOP~D can dodge, but that's not where the conversation has gone.  What started as "hey maybe AOP~D shouldn't dodge lows" has become "Ling is overpowered, ruining Tekken, and her HYP stance is too strong".  That's what's so damn frustrating to me right now.
Astagfirknee bro
Doesn't necessarily mean he's Arab. Muslim people like to incorporate some Arabic in their life, this includes communities in Pakistan, Malaysia, etc
    My Arabic's rough, but I think it says "Owner of the Big Shadow". Also, that's the default League of Legends profile pic. And the aggressive, trolley energy ... 99.99% chance of Arab with a 0.01% chance of SE Asian (Phillipino, Malaysian).

Source: 🡢🡠🡧🡣🡮🡢1️⃣
    it means he's most likely Arab instead of Pakistani
Knee a normal person? 

Yeah Mike Tyson was a normal person too.

Both people are top 0.001 % in their field. That’s not normal at all. 
You must be Beerus level of strength in Tekken if you think Knee is a normal guy lol.
    part of what makes the pros so sick is that they are just normal people. that's why we all have the potential to get there. he's one of us.

bootlicking a celebrity is why epstein's island could exist for so long.
        Being at the top of any respective field would actually make you abnormal. Not many people can be considered the best, Knee has consistently for many years been considered the best/one of the best so he's in fact not normal. Messi, Mike Tyson, Michael Phelps, Usain Bolt etc are at the top of the food chain in what they do. Normal is whatever the most common rank in T8 is if you wanna get technical bro. Normal is most of the people that are reading and commenting on this thread. I have never won a major and neither have you, so I don't see how you get the idea these guys are the same as us when it comes to Tekken. Also, I'm not bootlicking anybody. I respect Knee and have been following him for years I don't see how we go from Tekken to Epstein's Island but hey, the snarky comment really added to this conversation! Thanks, all you gotta do next is mention a current event and a politician to really derail this convo. I'd love to hear more bro. Really! Keep going! 🫵🏾😂
            [see emoji at the end of wall of text]

[downvote and move on without reading]

LOL
I agree with your second point but Knee is not just a normal person lol he was arguably top 2 in the world for like 18 years
Criticizing his playing, is at best, dodgy. Yes obviously you'll find the odd mistake in his playing, but it'd be like the guy that plays football on the weekends with his mates trying to tell Messi to get good and do better. Knee is one of the GOATs of Tekken, and while not infallible, his word should always have strong weight attached to it purely due to his raw experience and skill.
She got absolutely fucking killed in s2
If you get hit by the fully charged Launcher that is on you. She needs to charge it for the launcher, so if you don't interupt her that's your mistake. The real mix is the knockdown in HEAT since it's instant. Also like I said. If shes so strong just play her and win. But you hardly ever see her in ranked compared to the usual suspects like Drag, Feng and Devil Jin.
    you hardly saw Akuma in ranked T7 either, i guess he sucked
I agree people are taking it further than Knee was asking for but you can't honestly, in good faith, look at Ling ducking under some of the lowest hitting mids in the game or her avoiding tracking lows with SS AOP and say yeah there's no problem with that.
    Probably not - I'm not a Tekken expert, so I don't know. But what I am noticing is that people are now calling her 'brain dead', 'autopilot character' and other stuff that clearly doesn't apply. By all means, nerf her more unfair aspects, but don't nuke her just because you dislike the matchup.
Nothing Nerfed about Feng in T7 or T8. The nerfs they did give him in T7 was so minuscule it didn't change anything.
pft, okay i see
But saying she's "literally the best character so much that she absolutely requires a nerf" and "she's not in the top 5" are mutually exclusive.  Game is too young and there are too many variables for even the best players to be throwing out "nerf this or that" opinions. That's what I'm saying.
    Did you just conveniently ignore the other guy that already told you that Jun was nerfed between the statement and the tier list?
        She wasn't nerfed in the way that Knee was complaining though? She still has basically everything he initially complained about.
    Knee didn't say Jun was the best character, he said she was broken. She was one of the first characters to get nerfs too, the devs were definitely eyeballing her from day 1. Let's not pretend Knee's opinion on Jun was invalid as if she didn't immediately get hit by nerfs like Dragunov and Devil Jin did.
    When did he say Jun needs a nerf? He said she was strong and broken. Not that she needed a nerf. Not sure how this supports your argument. Btw Jun got nerfed between statements. 

He didn't say that she was the best character and he didn't say those words. His issue is specifically with aop duck causing alot of lows to whiff.

Also, Xiaoyu specialists are washing both Knee and Arslan 3-0 when they were handily beating her 0-3 a few months back in tournaments. Tekken is a legacy game man. If things change that much that the top 2 best players in tekken struggle versus them then surely it's an issue.

How long do you actually wanna wait before anyone can say anything about balance? People called JP OP from the beginning and I saw many people say similar things to you lol. Look, JP got nerfed.
Sorry hun, I just wanted to make a joke about Feng
    [deleted]
        i'm sorry i insulted ur fave bb, i dont think he'll notice u tho
Says a lot that he chose Feng over her lol
because there are a lot of feng player man idk lol. i play jun right now, i can accept that thing is broken.
    I mained Xiao from day one because she was one of the least played characters on release week and I had no idea she was that strong so I wont defend her either.

I started playing Jun yesterday and she's amazing.
imagine being so shit you beg for a low tier to be nerfed 🤡
    ok
If it’s a bug then that’s different. No where does this post say that though. But generally what I said still holds true. You should still find your characters move that hits her out of it
O shit. He still compete ?
    Yea he still competes. For a long time he was for sure #1 but a Pakistani player named arslan ash showed up and literally owned tekken 7. He beat Knee multiple times in tournaments as well.
Now implying that there's a decent amount of soft people in the comments. Chill. Go back to complaining about Tekken characters while you abuse your own character.
    Lmao way to deflect from your racism and geographic retardedness
        Damn you caught me. How'd you know.
            I'll hand it to you, you're owning your retardedness really well.
                Damn how'd you know that too?
                    Thank you for being the adult one here :)

The argument about Arabic letters makes no sense, true, and all tekken players get salty about match ups and prideful about many silly excuses in an attempt to deal with the anguish of not knowing how to get good quickly and consistently in a short amount of time, which is impossible.

You win and stay cool 😎.

(although you started the aggression a bit lol 😂)
                        By the way, what's happening is that Knee is sharing solid mechanical insights, given all the characteristics of all characters,, Xiaoyu's AOP is a bit OP.

It's good to hear and know this. A. She limits your options in a match when abused. B. The healthy response would be abusing your mains strong ssr catching mid.

Healthy talk yall chillll
                        It was pretty easy to tell where the guy was going with his first reply.
    [deleted]
        Yeah man
Sure kid, ur Knee is typically picking the strongest/broken chars. He can’t play X or Lei, for that u can look at Arslan)))
    Knee is actually one of the few top tier players that DOESN'T 100% tier whore the top 2 picks all the time.
    Bro doesn’t watch competitive tekken at all lmao
        He is a legend yes, but he can’t play Ling and never will.
            He can beat probably 99.99% of Tekken players with basic tools. 

Arslan is part of that .01%, obviously and they're also not ever going to be in a situation where Knee is not picking his mains. 

Knee is the Michael Jordan of Tekken. Arslan Ash is LeBron. He doesn't even have to try to beat some equivalent of a college walk-on just like Jordan would absolutely dumpster 6,999,999,900 if the 7 billion people in the world and the 100 or so he wouldn't, he would still usually beat, he would just have to extend effort to do so
                Yes I’m
Totally agreed with u, thx for it, but I’m sure that Knee will never pick Ling at tournaments, that’s my position, and if he does and win I will eat my hat)))
                    That's not what you said. 

You said Knee can't play Ling. That is false. He can play Ling better than most people can play Tekken. He could likely enter tournaments with Ling and still make Top 16 but why would he put himself at a disadvantage like that?
                        Competitively? No and another no) He did that for fun and abuse Sodam unsafe style and his knowledge of matchup)
                        He is billing Sodam again with broken king not Ling))

https://youtu.be/An-3NlmCIvY?si=FkE4riRFM9nq3fNE
            He already has my guy. He made it to top rank with Ling.
                I have seen Arslan training with Ling, do you have a proof about Knee? I have seen all Lings on YouTube since T3)))
                    https://www.reddit.com/r/Tekken/s/fKQ3MNtnZf

Knee made it to the highest rank (Tekken God Omega) with every single character in Tekken 7, I think it's fair to say he knows how to play Ling.
    lol he beat the crap out of mainman with kazuya, mainman's main for years.
😂😂😂
Arslan is undoubtedly the best player on earth, but accomplished? Knee takes that.
    Nobody beats Knee when it comes to Tekken as a whole. I’m sure Arslan would be amazing in previous games as well but Knee JDCR Qudans, these guys dominated Tekken from the get go and were in the spotlight. 

I’d never deny Arslan wouldn’t be a god in previous games but since we haven’t seen him then. I’m gonna put my money on Knee being the greatest player across the entire tekken competitive life.
Did we just forget Knee's history of Tekken prior to Tekken 7?
    Nah. Arslan still the GOAT
        If he keeps dominating Tekken 8, you could make that case. Until then it's Knee.
        dominating for the last years doesnt make you the GOAT, even then Knee won a Evo final against him so its not like its full on domination.
            Arslan is the GOAT just be the peak alone. Knee has never been as dominant as Arslan was during the end half of T7. He showed up out of  no where and dominated the whole scene for 4 years in a row. I know Knee has been near the top since Tekken5 but he has never peaked quite like Arslan did AND the scene during T7 was way more competitive than before T7.
                even Arslan lost a EVO final during his "peak" against Knee. besides Arslan still has to prove himself on anything else other than Tekken 7. Knee been on top for several games for two decades.
Is arslan the Tekken 7 GOAT? sure.
                    Knee won Khan in the EVO finals, not Arslan. But indeed we seem to disagree on what makes somebody the GOAT. I absolutely love Knee and always root for him (unless he is playing against JDCR) and I hope he can claim his title back with Tekken8
knee been on top since 2005, he might not be the current best but he is the most accomplished one by a mile.
It was absolutely awesome to watch Qudans and Knee try to punish Panda's ff2(?) time after time with different buttons and never have any success at it. TWT 2018 was something else
    Especially since Devil Jin has a very strong punish to that move, better than the rest of the roster at the time
Also even if some wins were due to matchup knowledge that's just because panda is a low priority matchup to learn, that isn't the case with a high tier like xiaoyu, knee is actively trying to figure her out and failing to do so
    In the case of TWT Finals that doesn't fly. All 19 finalists were decided a month before Finals (and some were already guaranteed a spot almost 2 months in advance). So its basic due diligence to study and prepare for every other finalist. The only wildcard is the LCQ winner.



Also Knee and Qudans had faced Rangchu's Panda multiple times throughout the 2018 TWT and beaten him every time they crossed paths. So its more likely they felt confident in their tactics against him. What made the difference was that Rangchu explained he would train the Devil Jin matchup with LowHigh for up to something like 8 hours a day. Since they had the same sponsor at the time. Rangchu had impeccable timing on when Qudans would go for hellsweep and Qudans kept fucking up the punish for bear ff2 (which was identical to Hei ff2). Also Knee had practically already won against Rangchu in LF. Dude just dropped the killing combo and Rangchu did not let that chance slip.



At that level of play, those are the type of things that are more important factors for winning. Reducing it to "low priority bear matchup" dismisses the effort Rangchu put in. You can't bank on trying to blindside the best players using the strongest characters with knowledge checks at Finals. You can take advantage of slip-ups (Knee's one-in-a-million combo drop) or failure to adapt (Qudans not using an easier consistent punish) sure but those aren't things you rely on as a winning strategy.
        Thank you, at least not everyone is a gaslighter around here.
        At a high level comfort in a matchup is similar to matchup knowledge too though. If you have the knowledge on how to deal with a character but then your also fighting a player of a high skill level recalling that info when you don't have to use it often while your mental stack is so high leads to mistakes like not punishing properly and being slower to react to stuff.
Wdym bears have both arms forward at the same time lol. They are both southpaw and orthodox at the same time
I'd bet Knee smokes that random tweeter if he played Xiaoyu and limited himself to 2 buttons.
Facts. She has insane evasion coupled with her offense being really good this time around and really good damage.

Xiaoyu kills you whether you attack or defend. Like release Leroy.
    Release leroy was basically a T8 character in T7, X is just playing T8 along with her usual stance bullshit which might be too much/op idk 90% of the cast seems overtuned to me.
        No, Tekken 8 characters are juiced but release Leroy was a different beast lol. I played him quite a bit on release and basically the main problems were:

* 1,1 ch jab string dealing 50 damage and wall splatting
* ff3 being homing, + on block and launching on hit - basically an electric
* df1 being -1 AND having followups, something that was unique to Heihachi, making it insane paired with his ch tools
* Orbital being -3 on block - A mid low crushing launcher with the same frames as a df1 on block. You could sidestep and murder your opponent if they tried to press something after blocking orbital
* Cane being a long ranged mid launcher that was +8 on block, basically a second Rage Drive, and it also dealt like 50 damage before the combo so it was absolutely insane
* d2, delayed 4 combo ender making sure every combo of his did 85+ without a wall
* His wall combo with hermit 4 into floor punches dealing insane damage - like nearly 40 - and also floor breaking on forgotten realm, I did 140 damage combos on that stage without rage
* b2 parry and b1+2 mid i12 ch launcher being impossible to whiff punish

Even in Tekken 8 I don't think there's anyone as OP as release Leroy
            I like how even listing out all these broken stuff you didn't even get to d1+2, the crazy long range, mid CH launcher, that forced crouching and was 0 on block.  Genuinely just one of the most spammable moves to ever be in Tekken.  Leroys at evo Japan would use this move for their entire neutral.
                lmao shit I forgot that one, yeah that move was insane

I also just remembered one more, db1,1+2 second hit was a mid ch launcher and safe on block
                Still crazy to me that Noroma made top8 with basically a Day 1 Leroy. Stream chat was losing their shit at how Noroma had no combos, but was still winning.
            I suppose we'll see at evo lol. 

I agree there's def no one character as overloaded like he was on release but instead of just one character being absolutely bullshit now it feels like most of the cast is a mini leroy and I'm not sure if I like that any better.
                Combo Breaker will be a good showcase of top players.
                I think Dragunov comes kinda close, maybe Azucena too haha. Just about every character can snowball into unending pressure once they gain momentum, but Dragunov feels like he can force his momentum whenever he wants
                    No version of Drag comes close to Leroy lmao
            What about fahk lol he was a different beast too
            I remember through all of that dumb people just kept saying git good despite the character being clearly broken.
        The problem is her offense is good and leaves her at plus. This makes her access to aop and its variants easy. Her evasion is top tier and you can't retaliate.
Straight up she wouldn't annoy me so much if I didn't feel like I was taking 50% every time she touched me.
Also this is the first game where AOP duck can consistently dodge lows apparently
It's specifically Ling mains that seem to be very emotionally charged over this discourse.
    Asked someone and they told me it's not fair because no one complains this much about Devil Jin
        That's the premier defense. The 'whataboutism'. Like "Well what bout Dragunov/Devil Jin/Feng?" etc etc.

It's crazy how you can't point anything out without some Ling main trying to direct the conversation away from Ling. So weird.
            Its the Ling agenda lmao. Although to be fair alot of people do that when their main is a strong its not just Ling players.
                I've seen the guy you're talking to on here also telling Knee to get good. Absolutely hilarious and delirious cunt that guy.
                    ikr xD. Ill never get people getting so defensive about their mains that they are willing to spread misinfo, gaslight and be nasty over a video game lmao.
                        I assure you, the guy in the screenshot and the guy you're talking to. Knee would fold the if they use Xiaoyu and he just jabbed.
This is such an emotional response tantamounting to whataboutism. Dragunov doesn't have any stance that evades lows.

Not that that matters though lol.
    I dont know. I kind of agree with that guy. If he thinks Xiaoyu is so overloaded and that AOP duck is incredibly OP just play it and use it. That's his job if he's a professional player, no?
        There legit hasn't even been a big tourney until April? You guys need to relax lmao. Not sure why you talk like there's been 10 tournaments when there's hasn't been one (big) tourney.

Also, he can talk about strong things. He's more adept at sussing things out than random joe like in the screenshot. Nothing wrong with that. People seem personally offended that Knee said one thing in their favourite characters kit is overloaded. So weird.
            You're acting like this is one comment Knee made about it. The screenshot in question is him doubling down, lol. People aren't personally offended, it's just he seems to go out of his way to talk about it more. Of course people are reacting to that, that's why it's here too.
                Doubling down? He presented evidence to his claims. How is that doubling down. I didn't know substantiating your claims was doubling down. Jesus christ. You guys are really emotional.

Also, people are definitely personally offended. Look at this thread and look at how the guy reacted telling Knee to 'learn the matchup'.

Look at the twitter thread and tell me with a straight face people aren't personally offended.
        MKLeo in smash played Byleth, who was considered low tier at the time, because he liked the character. The dude won multiple tournaments with them to the point where people changed their minds about the character’s placement on a tier list. There were multiple other characters at the time that were considered way more meta or broken than Byleth, but MKLeo thought Byleth was more fun and interesting to play. 

It’s the same concept here. Knee isn’t obligated to play the most broken character because she’s broken and that definitely doesn’t negate his very valid criticism.
            Facts. People get weirdly emotional about Xiaoyu for some reason. Alot of whataboutism and personal attacks (learn the match up to knee lol).
                Yeah I’ve watched a couple videos summarizing what people are saying (because I don’t have enough free time to constantly monitor what Twitter is saying lol) and X mains definitely seem to be upset because their character got called out.

I mean, I get it. If Zafina was this broken then I’d be upset the top Tekken player was calling for nerfs too.
                    It sucks people can't separate themselves from their main. Dragunov for example, I don't deny he's top 5 and very strong and needs some tuning.

And yeah I watched PhiDx's video on it. Great summary and relatively neutral. And the X mains still gave him shit for it when his proposed nerfs was just nerfing her frame advantage on HYP2.
            He's not obligated but I think "whining" or "criticism" depending on your perspective has a different color when you are a pro player as opposed to a mighty ruler guy playing from his couch on the weekends. 

It's fine to play what you like and think another character is strong but people endlessly ragged on lets say Speedkicks in T7 when he retired and said Akuma and etc. was too annoying to deal with but he wanted to stick with Hwo, he didn't want to play them. 

It's just kind of "want your cake and eat it too" as a professional to complain but also want to win doing your own way. As a professional your job is to win, so you should play what you personally think gives you the best chance to win. That's kind of exclusive with saying "XYZ character has too many tools and is extremely overbearing against the game" (not quoting him). It's eyeroll to tell Knee to "find the answers" but also, that is the correct generic response that people willingly use against others (accurately) when it suits them.
Just because a character is broken doesn’t mean characters are obligated to play them lmao. If Knee had fun playing her then he would. That doesn’t mean he can’t criticize how broken she is.
lol that's awesome

Is that kick a full on low or an s.low? Either way I can't decide which is more broken, Xiaoyu being able to duck it or Hwoarang even having that as an attack.

Man slightly adjusts his posture for 2 frames and that's a low hit somehow...probably one of those stupid kicks that cancels your guard too so he gets a guaranteed high+mid after it.
I haven't lost to them either, and I'm new to Tekken, so how good can they really be...?
    Probably just a bunch of circlejerks
The Lei community used to tell everyone he was one of the hardest characters in the game. He’s basically just a labbing nightmare. When a community for a character is very small they tend to dictate the image of that character. Xiaoyu is similar to Lei in that aspect. People used to say she’s extremely hard to play and that she’s mid tier at best. As soon as people start saying she’s good and needs tuning down they all grab the pitch fork’s because they’re all delusional about their main.
    Damn you must have some serious Lei ptsd lol
        Nah, that’s just how that was for tekken 7. There’s literally nothing difficult about lei, just add more bullshit at the end of the last bullshit. The lei players were delusional for years about it. Same with xiaoyu players. Same with yoshi players. Same with Nina players, except after blue ranks, that character is actually hard as shit
            Nina can bulldoze lower ranks that don't respect her plus frames or don't know how to step / duck some of her strings. However, the moment you hit a high-ish rank, the nightmare starts. You need to be extremely cracked to deal with players that know how to deal with Nina. It's not free neutral like Dragunov / Jun / Xiaoyu for example.
            That's what I'm saying man, we're in T8. Mental scarring from tekken 7 is literally post-traumatic lol.
                It’s just annoying to play block the 5 min string and low parry at the end into get the fuck off the floor with your opponent for 3 rounds.
            Yoshi isn't difficult? Being in the same convo as Nina and Xiaoyu feels wrong lol
                Yoshi is not difficult. And 10000% in the same category as Nina and ling
                    You just repeated what I said but as affirmative, idk why u think that tho
                        Best panic move in the game, broken move in general, easy combos, fucked range, “gimmicks” up the ass but really they’re good tools. Flash should be -25
    erm, when was Lei ever top tier?
    thats not even true, every lei main i ever saw on here would talk about how he appears hard at first but encouraged people to play him because with time spent he wasn't that difficult. this sub just wants any excuse to hate on lei. Some of you have such entitled behavior about different characters based on what you think the game should be like and it's really annoying.
It’s actually broken.
She carries the player because she has overly high damage and is characteristically evasive. She gets a launching throw into a full combo. She goes under a lot of lows (as outlined by PhiDX’s video).

It’s not difficult to understand. 

Her T7 form was fair because she conformed to Tekken rules.
    Yes, she is OP. That doesn't mean she 'carries' everyone who plays her. It still takes skill and practice. This is what I mean when I say people are overcorrecting. There is no happy middle ground between "character is OP, everyone who plays her is shit" and "character is fair, everyone who plays them is good". It's either one extreme or the other with this community.
        Reddit + Tekken (FGC, honestly). Don't expect too much when you come here.
    "Her T7 form was fair" 
Fucking lol.
I guess Xiao is only fair when she's bottom 5 huh
        Exactly.
        tbh with an archetype like hers they are usually Top 5 or Bottom 5 no inbetween. Very difficult to balance
Any character that is obscure and allows you to breeze through matches you wouldn't otherwise because your opponent doesn't know the matchup. Your opponent not knowing your character does make the game easier for you so saying she carries people to an extent is just true. Its the case of any knowledge check heavy character.  


I say this as someone that in 7 played many characters including Xiaoyu and i played her when i was much much worse at the game and she was one of the easiest chars for me to win with vs players far above my skill level.
    There is a difference between saying a character carries a player to an extent and that they 'totally carry them'.

And the whole thing about not knowing the matchup applies to all characters. Do you think I know King's throws, Hwoarang's barrage of kicks or Yoshimitsu's shenanigans as a beginner?

Lastly, to even be able to play Xiao at a level where her stance play truly confuses opponents and make for a knowledge check, you need lots and lots of practice. A Xiao noob is just as likely to K.O. themselves as they are their opponent, because of how vulnerable her stances make her.

So while I respect your experience, I respectfully disagree.
        It doesn't equally apply to all characters because some characters knowledge checks are easier to figure out OR are less rewarding even when your opponent doesn't understand them.  


The idea that Ling's stances make her vulnerable especially at lower to mid level play is blatantly dishonest considering the stance is highly evasive and the moves that can hit it are not as rewarding AND require specific knowledge to check that Ling can counter even if they have that knowledge. If i enter AOP vs the vast majority of players i don't even have to know how AOP works and my opponent will just miss because they don't know how to counter AOP. The idea that you need to alot of practice when they literally can't hit you without doing a very very limited set of moves they are unlikely to pick because they don't know is disingenuous at best. If they don't know they don't know and the only thing you need to practice is "how to enter AOP"  


You are right though that saying that they "totally carry them" is different. But as someone who plays MANY characters. Some characters are just MUCH MUCH easier to win with when your opponent doesn't know the char and its not at all equivalent across all chars.   


You only need alot of practice to use Ling's stance vs people that know the matchup. Its funny that you bring up Yoshimitsu because what your saying about Xiao's stances is actually true for Yoshimitsu at least in tekken 7. His moves are so niche and weak and his knowledge checks require either the opponent to not attack (which is rare at low levels where hyper offense is incredibly common) and are not as rewarding AND can get you clipped if misused.
ya i dont have horse in the race im pretty sure she is suppose to duck bryans shit and "fixing" this wont change it
    I'm pretty sure her ducking mids that are known to work against duck AOP and her straight up ducking lows is what needs fixing
My Arabic's rough, but I think it says "Owner of the Big Shadow". Also, that's the default League of Legends profile pic. And the aggressive, trolley energy ... 99.99% chance of Arab with a 0.01% chance of SE Asian (Phillipino, Malaysian).

Source: 🡢🡠🡧🡣🡮🡢1️⃣
it means he's most likely Arab instead of Pakistani
part of what makes the pros so sick is that they are just normal people. that's why we all have the potential to get there. he's one of us.

bootlicking a celebrity is why epstein's island could exist for so long.
    Being at the top of any respective field would actually make you abnormal. Not many people can be considered the best, Knee has consistently for many years been considered the best/one of the best so he's in fact not normal. Messi, Mike Tyson, Michael Phelps, Usain Bolt etc are at the top of the food chain in what they do. Normal is whatever the most common rank in T8 is if you wanna get technical bro. Normal is most of the people that are reading and commenting on this thread. I have never won a major and neither have you, so I don't see how you get the idea these guys are the same as us when it comes to Tekken. Also, I'm not bootlicking anybody. I respect Knee and have been following him for years I don't see how we go from Tekken to Epstein's Island but hey, the snarky comment really added to this conversation! Thanks, all you gotta do next is mention a current event and a politician to really derail this convo. I'd love to hear more bro. Really! Keep going! 🫵🏾😂
        [see emoji at the end of wall of text]

[downvote and move on without reading]

LOL
you hardly saw Akuma in ranked T7 either, i guess he sucked
Probably not - I'm not a Tekken expert, so I don't know. But what I am noticing is that people are now calling her 'brain dead', 'autopilot character' and other stuff that clearly doesn't apply. By all means, nerf her more unfair aspects, but don't nuke her just because you dislike the matchup.
Did you just conveniently ignore the other guy that already told you that Jun was nerfed between the statement and the tier list?
    She wasn't nerfed in the way that Knee was complaining though? She still has basically everything he initially complained about.
Knee didn't say Jun was the best character, he said she was broken. She was one of the first characters to get nerfs too, the devs were definitely eyeballing her from day 1. Let's not pretend Knee's opinion on Jun was invalid as if she didn't immediately get hit by nerfs like Dragunov and Devil Jin did.
When did he say Jun needs a nerf? He said she was strong and broken. Not that she needed a nerf. Not sure how this supports your argument. Btw Jun got nerfed between statements. 

He didn't say that she was the best character and he didn't say those words. His issue is specifically with aop duck causing alot of lows to whiff.

Also, Xiaoyu specialists are washing both Knee and Arslan 3-0 when they were handily beating her 0-3 a few months back in tournaments. Tekken is a legacy game man. If things change that much that the top 2 best players in tekken struggle versus them then surely it's an issue.

How long do you actually wanna wait before anyone can say anything about balance? People called JP OP from the beginning and I saw many people say similar things to you lol. Look, JP got nerfed.
[deleted]
    i'm sorry i insulted ur fave bb, i dont think he'll notice u tho
I mained Xiao from day one because she was one of the least played characters on release week and I had no idea she was that strong so I wont defend her either.

I started playing Jun yesterday and she's amazing.
ok
Yea he still competes. For a long time he was for sure #1 but a Pakistani player named arslan ash showed up and literally owned tekken 7. He beat Knee multiple times in tournaments as well.
Lmao way to deflect from your racism and geographic retardedness
    Damn you caught me. How'd you know.
        I'll hand it to you, you're owning your retardedness really well.
            Damn how'd you know that too?
                Thank you for being the adult one here :)

The argument about Arabic letters makes no sense, true, and all tekken players get salty about match ups and prideful about many silly excuses in an attempt to deal with the anguish of not knowing how to get good quickly and consistently in a short amount of time, which is impossible.

You win and stay cool 😎.

(although you started the aggression a bit lol 😂)
                    By the way, what's happening is that Knee is sharing solid mechanical insights, given all the characteristics of all characters,, Xiaoyu's AOP is a bit OP.

It's good to hear and know this. A. She limits your options in a match when abused. B. The healthy response would be abusing your mains strong ssr catching mid.

Healthy talk yall chillll
                    It was pretty easy to tell where the guy was going with his first reply.

    Yeah man
Knee is actually one of the few top tier players that DOESN'T 100% tier whore the top 2 picks all the time.
Bro doesn’t watch competitive tekken at all lmao
    He is a legend yes, but he can’t play Ling and never will.
        He can beat probably 99.99% of Tekken players with basic tools. 

Arslan is part of that .01%, obviously and they're also not ever going to be in a situation where Knee is not picking his mains. 

Knee is the Michael Jordan of Tekken. Arslan Ash is LeBron. He doesn't even have to try to beat some equivalent of a college walk-on just like Jordan would absolutely dumpster 6,999,999,900 if the 7 billion people in the world and the 100 or so he wouldn't, he would still usually beat, he would just have to extend effort to do so
            Yes I’m
Totally agreed with u, thx for it, but I’m sure that Knee will never pick Ling at tournaments, that’s my position, and if he does and win I will eat my hat)))
                That's not what you said. 

You said Knee can't play Ling. That is false. He can play Ling better than most people can play Tekken. He could likely enter tournaments with Ling and still make Top 16 but why would he put himself at a disadvantage like that?
                    Competitively? No and another no) He did that for fun and abuse Sodam unsafe style and his knowledge of matchup)
                    He is billing Sodam again with broken king not Ling))

https://youtu.be/An-3NlmCIvY?si=FkE4riRFM9nq3fNE
        He already has my guy. He made it to top rank with Ling.
            I have seen Arslan training with Ling, do you have a proof about Knee? I have seen all Lings on YouTube since T3)))
                https://www.reddit.com/r/Tekken/s/fKQ3MNtnZf

Knee made it to the highest rank (Tekken God Omega) with every single character in Tekken 7, I think it's fair to say he knows how to play Ling.
lol he beat the crap out of mainman with kazuya, mainman's main for years.
Nobody beats Knee when it comes to Tekken as a whole. I’m sure Arslan would be amazing in previous games as well but Knee JDCR Qudans, these guys dominated Tekken from the get go and were in the spotlight. 

I’d never deny Arslan wouldn’t be a god in previous games but since we haven’t seen him then. I’m gonna put my money on Knee being the greatest player across the entire tekken competitive life.
Nah. Arslan still the GOAT
    If he keeps dominating Tekken 8, you could make that case. Until then it's Knee.
    dominating for the last years doesnt make you the GOAT, even then Knee won a Evo final against him so its not like its full on domination.
        Arslan is the GOAT just be the peak alone. Knee has never been as dominant as Arslan was during the end half of T7. He showed up out of  no where and dominated the whole scene for 4 years in a row. I know Knee has been near the top since Tekken5 but he has never peaked quite like Arslan did AND the scene during T7 was way more competitive than before T7.
            even Arslan lost a EVO final during his "peak" against Knee. besides Arslan still has to prove himself on anything else other than Tekken 7. Knee been on top for several games for two decades.
Is arslan the Tekken 7 GOAT? sure.
                Knee won Khan in the EVO finals, not Arslan. But indeed we seem to disagree on what makes somebody the GOAT. I absolutely love Knee and always root for him (unless he is playing against JDCR) and I hope he can claim his title back with Tekken8
Especially since Devil Jin has a very strong punish to that move, better than the rest of the roster at the time
In the case of TWT Finals that doesn't fly. All 19 finalists were decided a month before Finals (and some were already guaranteed a spot almost 2 months in advance). So its basic due diligence to study and prepare for every other finalist. The only wildcard is the LCQ winner.



Also Knee and Qudans had faced Rangchu's Panda multiple times throughout the 2018 TWT and beaten him every time they crossed paths. So its more likely they felt confident in their tactics against him. What made the difference was that Rangchu explained he would train the Devil Jin matchup with LowHigh for up to something like 8 hours a day. Since they had the same sponsor at the time. Rangchu had impeccable timing on when Qudans would go for hellsweep and Qudans kept fucking up the punish for bear ff2 (which was identical to Hei ff2). Also Knee had practically already won against Rangchu in LF. Dude just dropped the killing combo and Rangchu did not let that chance slip.



At that level of play, those are the type of things that are more important factors for winning. Reducing it to "low priority bear matchup" dismisses the effort Rangchu put in. You can't bank on trying to blindside the best players using the strongest characters with knowledge checks at Finals. You can take advantage of slip-ups (Knee's one-in-a-million combo drop) or failure to adapt (Qudans not using an easier consistent punish) sure but those aren't things you rely on as a winning strategy.
    Thank you, at least not everyone is a gaslighter around here.
    At a high level comfort in a matchup is similar to matchup knowledge too though. If you have the knowledge on how to deal with a character but then your also fighting a player of a high skill level recalling that info when you don't have to use it often while your mental stack is so high leads to mistakes like not punishing properly and being slower to react to stuff.
Release leroy was basically a T8 character in T7, X is just playing T8 along with her usual stance bullshit which might be too much/op idk 90% of the cast seems overtuned to me.
    No, Tekken 8 characters are juiced but release Leroy was a different beast lol. I played him quite a bit on release and basically the main problems were:

* 1,1 ch jab string dealing 50 damage and wall splatting
* ff3 being homing, + on block and launching on hit - basically an electric
* df1 being -1 AND having followups, something that was unique to Heihachi, making it insane paired with his ch tools
* Orbital being -3 on block - A mid low crushing launcher with the same frames as a df1 on block. You could sidestep and murder your opponent if they tried to press something after blocking orbital
* Cane being a long ranged mid launcher that was +8 on block, basically a second Rage Drive, and it also dealt like 50 damage before the combo so it was absolutely insane
* d2, delayed 4 combo ender making sure every combo of his did 85+ without a wall
* His wall combo with hermit 4 into floor punches dealing insane damage - like nearly 40 - and also floor breaking on forgotten realm, I did 140 damage combos on that stage without rage
* b2 parry and b1+2 mid i12 ch launcher being impossible to whiff punish

Even in Tekken 8 I don't think there's anyone as OP as release Leroy
        I like how even listing out all these broken stuff you didn't even get to d1+2, the crazy long range, mid CH launcher, that forced crouching and was 0 on block.  Genuinely just one of the most spammable moves to ever be in Tekken.  Leroys at evo Japan would use this move for their entire neutral.
            lmao shit I forgot that one, yeah that move was insane

I also just remembered one more, db1,1+2 second hit was a mid ch launcher and safe on block
            Still crazy to me that Noroma made top8 with basically a Day 1 Leroy. Stream chat was losing their shit at how Noroma had no combos, but was still winning.
        I suppose we'll see at evo lol. 

I agree there's def no one character as overloaded like he was on release but instead of just one character being absolutely bullshit now it feels like most of the cast is a mini leroy and I'm not sure if I like that any better.
            Combo Breaker will be a good showcase of top players.
            I think Dragunov comes kinda close, maybe Azucena too haha. Just about every character can snowball into unending pressure once they gain momentum, but Dragunov feels like he can force his momentum whenever he wants
                No version of Drag comes close to Leroy lmao
        What about fahk lol he was a different beast too
        I remember through all of that dumb people just kept saying git good despite the character being clearly broken.
    The problem is her offense is good and leaves her at plus. This makes her access to aop and its variants easy. Her evasion is top tier and you can't retaliate.
Asked someone and they told me it's not fair because no one complains this much about Devil Jin
    That's the premier defense. The 'whataboutism'. Like "Well what bout Dragunov/Devil Jin/Feng?" etc etc.

It's crazy how you can't point anything out without some Ling main trying to direct the conversation away from Ling. So weird.
        Its the Ling agenda lmao. Although to be fair alot of people do that when their main is a strong its not just Ling players.
            I've seen the guy you're talking to on here also telling Knee to get good. Absolutely hilarious and delirious cunt that guy.
                ikr xD. Ill never get people getting so defensive about their mains that they are willing to spread misinfo, gaslight and be nasty over a video game lmao.
                    I assure you, the guy in the screenshot and the guy you're talking to. Knee would fold the if they use Xiaoyu and he just jabbed.
I dont know. I kind of agree with that guy. If he thinks Xiaoyu is so overloaded and that AOP duck is incredibly OP just play it and use it. That's his job if he's a professional player, no?
    There legit hasn't even been a big tourney until April? You guys need to relax lmao. Not sure why you talk like there's been 10 tournaments when there's hasn't been one (big) tourney.

Also, he can talk about strong things. He's more adept at sussing things out than random joe like in the screenshot. Nothing wrong with that. People seem personally offended that Knee said one thing in their favourite characters kit is overloaded. So weird.
        You're acting like this is one comment Knee made about it. The screenshot in question is him doubling down, lol. People aren't personally offended, it's just he seems to go out of his way to talk about it more. Of course people are reacting to that, that's why it's here too.
            Doubling down? He presented evidence to his claims. How is that doubling down. I didn't know substantiating your claims was doubling down. Jesus christ. You guys are really emotional.

Also, people are definitely personally offended. Look at this thread and look at how the guy reacted telling Knee to 'learn the matchup'.

Look at the twitter thread and tell me with a straight face people aren't personally offended.
    MKLeo in smash played Byleth, who was considered low tier at the time, because he liked the character. The dude won multiple tournaments with them to the point where people changed their minds about the character’s placement on a tier list. There were multiple other characters at the time that were considered way more meta or broken than Byleth, but MKLeo thought Byleth was more fun and interesting to play. 

It’s the same concept here. Knee isn’t obligated to play the most broken character because she’s broken and that definitely doesn’t negate his very valid criticism.
        Facts. People get weirdly emotional about Xiaoyu for some reason. Alot of whataboutism and personal attacks (learn the match up to knee lol).
            Yeah I’ve watched a couple videos summarizing what people are saying (because I don’t have enough free time to constantly monitor what Twitter is saying lol) and X mains definitely seem to be upset because their character got called out.

I mean, I get it. If Zafina was this broken then I’d be upset the top Tekken player was calling for nerfs too.
                It sucks people can't separate themselves from their main. Dragunov for example, I don't deny he's top 5 and very strong and needs some tuning.

And yeah I watched PhiDx's video on it. Great summary and relatively neutral. And the X mains still gave him shit for it when his proposed nerfs was just nerfing her frame advantage on HYP2.
        He's not obligated but I think "whining" or "criticism" depending on your perspective has a different color when you are a pro player as opposed to a mighty ruler guy playing from his couch on the weekends. 

It's fine to play what you like and think another character is strong but people endlessly ragged on lets say Speedkicks in T7 when he retired and said Akuma and etc. was too annoying to deal with but he wanted to stick with Hwo, he didn't want to play them. 

It's just kind of "want your cake and eat it too" as a professional to complain but also want to win doing your own way. As a professional your job is to win, so you should play what you personally think gives you the best chance to win. That's kind of exclusive with saying "XYZ character has too many tools and is extremely overbearing against the game" (not quoting him). It's eyeroll to tell Knee to "find the answers" but also, that is the correct generic response that people willingly use against others (accurately) when it suits them.
Probably just a bunch of circlejerks
Damn you must have some serious Lei ptsd lol
    Nah, that’s just how that was for tekken 7. There’s literally nothing difficult about lei, just add more bullshit at the end of the last bullshit. The lei players were delusional for years about it. Same with xiaoyu players. Same with yoshi players. Same with Nina players, except after blue ranks, that character is actually hard as shit
        Nina can bulldoze lower ranks that don't respect her plus frames or don't know how to step / duck some of her strings. However, the moment you hit a high-ish rank, the nightmare starts. You need to be extremely cracked to deal with players that know how to deal with Nina. It's not free neutral like Dragunov / Jun / Xiaoyu for example.
        That's what I'm saying man, we're in T8. Mental scarring from tekken 7 is literally post-traumatic lol.
            It’s just annoying to play block the 5 min string and low parry at the end into get the fuck off the floor with your opponent for 3 rounds.
        Yoshi isn't difficult? Being in the same convo as Nina and Xiaoyu feels wrong lol
            Yoshi is not difficult. And 10000% in the same category as Nina and ling
                You just repeated what I said but as affirmative, idk why u think that tho
                    Best panic move in the game, broken move in general, easy combos, fucked range, “gimmicks” up the ass but really they’re good tools. Flash should be -25
erm, when was Lei ever top tier?
thats not even true, every lei main i ever saw on here would talk about how he appears hard at first but encouraged people to play him because with time spent he wasn't that difficult. this sub just wants any excuse to hate on lei. Some of you have such entitled behavior about different characters based on what you think the game should be like and it's really annoying.
Yes, she is OP. That doesn't mean she 'carries' everyone who plays her. It still takes skill and practice. This is what I mean when I say people are overcorrecting. There is no happy middle ground between "character is OP, everyone who plays her is shit" and "character is fair, everyone who plays them is good". It's either one extreme or the other with this community.
    Reddit + Tekken (FGC, honestly). Don't expect too much when you come here.
"Her T7 form was fair" 
Fucking lol.
I guess Xiao is only fair when she's bottom 5 huh
    Exactly.
    tbh with an archetype like hers they are usually Top 5 or Bottom 5 no inbetween. Very difficult to balance
There is a difference between saying a character carries a player to an extent and that they 'totally carry them'.

And the whole thing about not knowing the matchup applies to all characters. Do you think I know King's throws, Hwoarang's barrage of kicks or Yoshimitsu's shenanigans as a beginner?

Lastly, to even be able to play Xiao at a level where her stance play truly confuses opponents and make for a knowledge check, you need lots and lots of practice. A Xiao noob is just as likely to K.O. themselves as they are their opponent, because of how vulnerable her stances make her.

So while I respect your experience, I respectfully disagree.
    It doesn't equally apply to all characters because some characters knowledge checks are easier to figure out OR are less rewarding even when your opponent doesn't understand them.  


The idea that Ling's stances make her vulnerable especially at lower to mid level play is blatantly dishonest considering the stance is highly evasive and the moves that can hit it are not as rewarding AND require specific knowledge to check that Ling can counter even if they have that knowledge. If i enter AOP vs the vast majority of players i don't even have to know how AOP works and my opponent will just miss because they don't know how to counter AOP. The idea that you need to alot of practice when they literally can't hit you without doing a very very limited set of moves they are unlikely to pick because they don't know is disingenuous at best. If they don't know they don't know and the only thing you need to practice is "how to enter AOP"  


You are right though that saying that they "totally carry them" is different. But as someone who plays MANY characters. Some characters are just MUCH MUCH easier to win with when your opponent doesn't know the char and its not at all equivalent across all chars.   


You only need alot of practice to use Ling's stance vs people that know the matchup. Its funny that you bring up Yoshimitsu because what your saying about Xiao's stances is actually true for Yoshimitsu at least in tekken 7. His moves are so niche and weak and his knowledge checks require either the opponent to not attack (which is rare at low levels where hyper offense is incredibly common) and are not as rewarding AND can get you clipped if misused.
I'm pretty sure her ducking mids that are known to work against duck AOP and her straight up ducking lows is what needs fixing
Being at the top of any respective field would actually make you abnormal. Not many people can be considered the best, Knee has consistently for many years been considered the best/one of the best so he's in fact not normal. Messi, Mike Tyson, Michael Phelps, Usain Bolt etc are at the top of the food chain in what they do. Normal is whatever the most common rank in T8 is if you wanna get technical bro. Normal is most of the people that are reading and commenting on this thread. I have never won a major and neither have you, so I don't see how you get the idea these guys are the same as us when it comes to Tekken. Also, I'm not bootlicking anybody. I respect Knee and have been following him for years I don't see how we go from Tekken to Epstein's Island but hey, the snarky comment really added to this conversation! Thanks, all you gotta do next is mention a current event and a politician to really derail this convo. I'd love to hear more bro. Really! Keep going! 🫵🏾😂
    [see emoji at the end of wall of text]

[downvote and move on without reading]

LOL
She wasn't nerfed in the way that Knee was complaining though? She still has basically everything he initially complained about.
i'm sorry i insulted ur fave bb, i dont think he'll notice u tho
Damn you caught me. How'd you know.
    I'll hand it to you, you're owning your retardedness really well.
        Damn how'd you know that too?
            Thank you for being the adult one here :)

The argument about Arabic letters makes no sense, true, and all tekken players get salty about match ups and prideful about many silly excuses in an attempt to deal with the anguish of not knowing how to get good quickly and consistently in a short amount of time, which is impossible.

You win and stay cool 😎.

(although you started the aggression a bit lol 😂)
                By the way, what's happening is that Knee is sharing solid mechanical insights, given all the characteristics of all characters,, Xiaoyu's AOP is a bit OP.

It's fine to play what you like and think another character is strong but people endlessly ragged on lets say Speedkicks in T7 when he retired and said Akuma and etc. was too annoying to deal with but he wanted to stick with Hwo, he didn't want to play them. 

It's just kind of "want your cake and eat it too" as a professional to complain but also want to win doing your own way. As a professional your job is to win, so you should play what you personally think gives you the best chance to win. That's kind of exclusive with saying "XYZ character has too many tools and is extremely overbearing against the game" (not quoting him). It's eyeroll to tell Knee to "find the answers" but also, that is the correct generic response that people willingly use against others (accurately) when it suits them.
Nah, that’s just how that was for tekken 7. There’s literally nothing difficult about lei, just add more bullshit at the end of the last bullshit. The lei players were delusional for years about it. Same with xiaoyu players. Same with yoshi players. Same with Nina players, except after blue ranks, that character is actually hard as shit
    Nina can bulldoze lower ranks that don't respect her plus frames or don't know how to step / duck some of her strings. However, the moment you hit a high-ish rank, the nightmare starts. You need to be extremely cracked to deal with players that know how to deal with Nina. It's not free neutral like Dragunov / Jun / Xiaoyu for example.
    That's what I'm saying man, we're in T8. Mental scarring from tekken 7 is literally post-traumatic lol.
        It’s just annoying to play block the 5 min string and low parry at the end into get the fuck off the floor with your opponent for 3 rounds.
    Yoshi isn't difficult? Being in the same convo as Nina and Xiaoyu feels wrong lol
        Yoshi is not difficult. And 10000% in the same category as Nina and ling
            You just repeated what I said but as affirmative, idk why u think that tho
                Best panic move in the game, broken move in general, easy combos, fucked range, “gimmicks” up the ass but really they’re good tools. Flash should be -25
Reddit + Tekken (FGC, honestly). Don't expect too much when you come here.
Exactly.
tbh with an archetype like hers they are usually Top 5 or Bottom 5 no inbetween. Very difficult to balance
It doesn't equally apply to all characters because some characters knowledge checks are easier to figure out OR are less rewarding even when your opponent doesn't understand them.  


The idea that Ling's stances make her vulnerable especially at lower to mid level play is blatantly dishonest considering the stance is highly evasive and the moves that can hit it are not as rewarding AND require specific knowledge to check that Ling can counter even if they have that knowledge. If i enter AOP vs the vast majority of players i don't even have to know how AOP works and my opponent will just miss because they don't know how to counter AOP. The idea that you need to alot of practice when they literally can't hit you without doing a very very limited set of moves they are unlikely to pick because they don't know is disingenuous at best. If they don't know they don't know and the only thing you need to practice is "how to enter AOP"  


You are right though that saying that they "totally carry them" is different. But as someone who plays MANY characters. Some characters are just MUCH MUCH easier to win with when your opponent doesn't know the char and its not at all equivalent across all chars.   


You only need alot of practice to use Ling's stance vs people that know the matchup. Its funny that you bring up Yoshimitsu because what your saying about Xiao's stances is actually true for Yoshimitsu at least in tekken 7. His moves are so niche and weak and his knowledge checks require either the opponent to not attack (which is rare at low levels where hyper offense is incredibly common) and are not as rewarding AND can get you clipped if misused.

LOL
I'll hand it to you, you're owning your retardedness really well.
    Damn how'd you know that too?
        Thank you for being the adult one here :)

The argument about Arabic letters makes no sense, true, and all tekken players get salty about match ups and prideful about many silly excuses in an attempt to deal with the anguish of not knowing how to get good quickly and consistently in a short amount of time, which is impossible.

You win and stay cool 😎.

(although you started the aggression a bit lol 😂)
            By the way, what's happening is that Knee is sharing solid mechanical insights, given all the characteristics of all characters,, Xiaoyu's AOP is a bit OP.

It's good to hear and know this. A. She limits your options in a match when abused. B. The healthy response would be abusing your mains strong ssr catching mid.

Healthy talk yall chillll
            It was pretty easy to tell where the guy was going with his first reply.
He can beat probably 99.99% of Tekken players with basic tools. 

Arslan is part of that .01%, obviously and they're also not ever going to be in a situation where Knee is not picking his mains. 

Knee is the Michael Jordan of Tekken. Arslan Ash is LeBron. He doesn't even have to try to beat some equivalent of a college walk-on just like Jordan would absolutely dumpster 6,999,999,900 if the 7 billion people in the world and the 100 or so he wouldn't, he would still usually beat, he would just have to extend effort to do so
    Yes I’m
Totally agreed with u, thx for it, but I’m sure that Knee will never pick Ling at tournaments, that’s my position, and if he does and win I will eat my hat)))
        That's not what you said. 

You said Knee can't play Ling. That is false. He can play Ling better than most people can play Tekken. He could likely enter tournaments with Ling and still make Top 16 but why would he put himself at a disadvantage like that?
            Competitively? No and another no) He did that for fun and abuse Sodam unsafe style and his knowledge of matchup)
            He is billing Sodam again with broken king not Ling))

https://youtu.be/An-3NlmCIvY?si=FkE4riRFM9nq3fNE
He already has my guy. He made it to top rank with Ling.
    I have seen Arslan training with Ling, do you have a proof about Knee? I have seen all Lings on YouTube since T3)))
        https://www.reddit.com/r/Tekken/s/fKQ3MNtnZf

Knee made it to the highest rank (Tekken God Omega) with every single character in Tekken 7, I think it's fair to say he knows how to play Ling.
Arslan is the GOAT just be the peak alone. Knee has never been as dominant as Arslan was during the end half of T7. He showed up out of  no where and dominated the whole scene for 4 years in a row. I know Knee has been near the top since Tekken5 but he has never peaked quite like Arslan did AND the scene during T7 was way more competitive than before T7.
    even Arslan lost a EVO final during his "peak" against Knee. besides Arslan still has to prove himself on anything else other than Tekken 7. Knee been on top for several games for two decades.
Is arslan the Tekken 7 GOAT? sure.
        Knee won Khan in the EVO finals, not Arslan. But indeed we seem to disagree on what makes somebody the GOAT. I absolutely love Knee and always root for him (unless he is playing against JDCR) and I hope he can claim his title back with Tekken8
I like how even listing out all these broken stuff you didn't even get to d1+2, the crazy long range, mid CH launcher, that forced crouching and was 0 on block.  Genuinely just one of the most spammable moves to ever be in Tekken.  Leroys at evo Japan would use this move for their entire neutral.
    lmao shit I forgot that one, yeah that move was insane

I also just remembered one more, db1,1+2 second hit was a mid ch launcher and safe on block
    Still crazy to me that Noroma made top8 with basically a Day 1 Leroy. Stream chat was losing their shit at how Noroma had no combos, but was still winning.
I suppose we'll see at evo lol. 

I agree there's def no one character as overloaded like he was on release but instead of just one character being absolutely bullshit now it feels like most of the cast is a mini leroy and I'm not sure if I like that any better.
    Combo Breaker will be a good showcase of top players.
    I think Dragunov comes kinda close, maybe Azucena too haha. Just about every character can snowball into unending pressure once they gain momentum, but Dragunov feels like he can force his momentum whenever he wants
        No version of Drag comes close to Leroy lmao
What about fahk lol he was a different beast too
I remember through all of that dumb people just kept saying git good despite the character being clearly broken.
Its the Ling agenda lmao. Although to be fair alot of people do that when their main is a strong its not just Ling players.
    I've seen the guy you're talking to on here also telling Knee to get good. Absolutely hilarious and delirious cunt that guy.
        ikr xD. Ill never get people getting so defensive about their mains that they are willing to spread misinfo, gaslight and be nasty over a video game lmao.
            I assure you, the guy in the screenshot and the guy you're talking to. Knee would fold the if they use Xiaoyu and he just jabbed.
You're acting like this is one comment Knee made about it. The screenshot in question is him doubling down, lol. People aren't personally offended, it's just he seems to go out of his way to talk about it more. Of course people are reacting to that, that's why it's here too.
    Doubling down? He presented evidence to his claims. How is that doubling down. I didn't know substantiating your claims was doubling down. Jesus christ. You guys are really emotional.

Also, people are definitely personally offended. Look at this thread and look at how the guy reacted telling Knee to 'learn the matchup'.

Look at the twitter thread and tell me with a straight face people aren't personally offended.
Facts. People get weirdly emotional about Xiaoyu for some reason. Alot of whataboutism and personal attacks (learn the match up to knee lol).
    Yeah I’ve watched a couple videos summarizing what people are saying (because I don’t have enough free time to constantly monitor what Twitter is saying lol) and X mains definitely seem to be upset because their character got called out.

I mean, I get it. If Zafina was this broken then I’d be upset the top Tekken player was calling for nerfs too.
        It sucks people can't separate themselves from their main. Dragunov for example, I don't deny he's top 5 and very strong and needs some tuning.

And yeah I watched PhiDx's video on it. Great summary and relatively neutral. And the X mains still gave him shit for it when his proposed nerfs was just nerfing her frame advantage on HYP2.
