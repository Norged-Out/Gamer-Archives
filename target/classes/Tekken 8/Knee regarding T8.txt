[[Knee regarding T8]]





Knee is such a legend, man. What a great, humble response to this.
    The self-awareness and humility to acknowledge that he might be frustrated because he's getting old and his legacy skills don't port well to the new game is great.

There's a lifetime of habit to adapt to and overcome in order for him to find his "flow" in T8. Those old habits aren't serving him well right now, and newer players less "burdened" with ingrained legacy playstyles/habits may be able to adapt more quickly to what T8 *is*, rather than trying to play what Tekken *was*.
        You don't get that good at a game by thinking you know everything, gotta have the humility to keep learning.
        This is what I had to learn and accept when SFIV came out.  I was so used to the old way of Capcom fighters, that I just couldn’t adapt to the new style.

I’ve gotten better with them as time has gone on, but I’m nowhere near as good as I was then.  Of course, age has gone way up and playtime has gone way down, so that’s as much of it as anything else.
        The self-awareness and humility of the glazing on this post 🤣🤣
        He's saying the right thing. But I think he knows deep down T8 will never be as fun as the old Tekkens.


I know it's hard to accept, so people drink that copium.


The game sucks tho. It's that simple lol.


People like Knee can "try" to like it all they want, but you shouldn't have to try so hard to enjoy a video game. 


I think that's the main thing. He said he wasn't having fun and this is a common sentiment. The game just isn't as fun with the new direction. Rushdown gets old fast if there's no variety. When rushdown was just 1 style it was great. Variety is the spice of life.
    Hes probably being diplomatic. He's probably not gonna sugarcoat it when he's talking with his friends in person.
        he definitely shouldn't need to say sorry for not enjoying the game
        Yup, no one with half a brain and a reputation to uphold will post their real thoughts on X.
    It’s interesting that both him and arsal and ash (or whatever his name is. Lol) has the same sentiment in such a short time. He similarly posted apologies for complaining and vowed to adapt. 

Curious if the Sajam video about it having a bad effect on the community favored in at all?
        Bro said arsal and ash

                    He did the T3 Yoshi side-throw once and the two halves never merged back together.
            Bruh im over here trying to figure out who arsal was lol, I figured ash was shortened for Arslan ash but I did not realize arsal and was ment to be apart lol
                Ment
                    I'm misspelling some words on purpose. At first its cause I was lazy and did not know how to spell "probably" right and always spelled probly, but now I'm doing it on purpose cause chat bots and ai don't do stuff like that and I think it's just more fun, although I still use proper grammer for essays and stuff
                        You did that last one on purpose, didn’t you?
            Arsenal. Oscar Kazama. Hello amigos.
            I could have googled but was too lazy.  Lol :)
        All I can think when about when I see this Tekken stuff is that Sajam segment he did like a week ago. 

He put into words what ive been thinking about video games discourse online in general for the longest time.
        I doubt either one of them cares what sajam had to say about a Tekken game
        Lol, arsal !!, he won evo 4 times, you should at least know his name if you watch tekken tournaments.
            I am super ADHD, so details like this often escape me.  I have a vague enough idea of their name to recognize it if I see it, but not enough to spell it.
        Thats because him and arsenal are both getting clobbered at locals. They kinda always tweet right after getting smashed, which makes for more heated takes. So in comparison this is knee being calmed down and more self-aware.
            True. Arsenal had a very rough couple of days, but im not sure if knee would fare better against Bayern. Tho his defensive style may be difficult to crack.
        Well i know Arslan has been in the US getting washed up by the players here… feels like thats why he changed his mind
    Nah he me need to stand on business because he wasn’t wrong in the first place
Based Knee
    I am seeing "based" on reddit but I don't get it, what does it mean when someone is "based"?
        Usually it's just a way of saying "this person is spittin facts"
            Ok now I know the meaning, but from where this comes from, based? Like based on something?
                [https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/based](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/based)
                    I’m glad Lil B gets his flowers on this because he literally came up with the slang and now people don’t even realize how strongly it’s associated with him
                        Lil B had waaay more influence than people will ever give him credit for lol
                            ya ill contribute to this tangent. i love that man. real ones know
                        Yeah man he's from Berkeley/Oakland. I remember my friend Natasha now known as Kreayshawn used to shoot videos for Lil B. She began a music career when she saw how easy it was to do music videos and go viral
                Idk the origin really and as far as i know it's not really used in a "based on this.." way. It's actually kind of a running meme that ppl reply "based on what?" When they don't understand how or why the word is being used that way. Sorry if this explanation is lacking.
                    Nah you're good, thank you.
                based on your mom lmao gottem
                Literally just means that the person is standing on a strong ideological base and that they aren't likely to be pushed off of it because it is strong. Overwhelmingly used as a compliment, although it is possible to be based on a flawed foundation.
        Internet edgelords took it from lil b
        It means they're based in Reddit: they live here.
Dude made the most humble remark about a game just saying he doesn't enjoy it and feels like he has to appologize for that.

That makes me sad.
    Yup because the damn brainless twitter user will crucify him for his opinion.
        Yeah that's what makes it so sad. Here you have a man who devoted large chunks of his live to Tekken and build a career of it just for an army of red ranks go "Loly git gud scrub." 

This is so undignified.
            It also goes the other way I doubt he wants people to use his opinion to validate shitting on the game because they're hardstuck red.

Which is what a lot of people are doing, a lot of complaints pros make are specific to that level of tekken and for them it's also their job.

I literally saw someone saying nothing should be faster than a 10f jab that breaks the rules of tekken then they complain that flash is a 9 frame start up that robs their turn.
As if yoshis flash hasn't been around since tekken 3

I'm all for criticising the game but it's just a tiring seeing people rush to shit on it as it is to defend it
Chip damage was a mistake. Why am I getting punished for correctly blocking everything while trying to read my oppponent?
    If it had to be there at all, it should have been exclusive to heat.
        That's what I thought it was when the heat system and chip was announced. But then the day I got the game I was like "where tf did 20% of my health go???".
            \*record scratches\*

Wait, why do I remember hearing/reading you wouldn't get chip unless it was heat? Did I just lose to translation? Chip damage happens outside of heat? 

If this just grey health system? 

Ooof, maybe 1 too many systems in place.
                You take chip damage "grey health" when you block attacks. You regen grey health when you attack whether its blocked or it hits. Engaging heat heals all your grey health. You lose when all your red health is gone, though you can't be chipped to death.

When tekken 8 was announced and the new systems talked about. I thought chip only happened while in heat. But thats not true. Which seems weird.
                Not all moves add chip damage.  But those that do give chip damage in heat or not.  (Damage goes up in heat though)
        This would've been fine

Like how in SF6, they made it so chip only happens when you're in burnout state
            I really like the drive gauge in sf6. It’s powerful but if you go too ham burnout can be really punishing.
        I agree. As much as I enjoy Tekken 8, I do think chip damage should just happen after you activate heat mode. It kind of makes no sense to have chip damage happen under any other circumstance really. I noticed chip damage happen when I played a few days ago when neither of us were in Heat and thought that was weird. I get that the direction is all about offense and I do broadly support that, but you shouldn't be punished for blocking something successfully in this way.
            Some moves have innate chip properties like Asuka's ff1+2 and running 1+2 for example. As for the heat chip damage debate i am all for it since you gain back that health by attacking. It is a mechanic  meant to punish turtiling up which alot of intermediate and beginner players often do. Now i will agree that the amount of chip damage should be lowered a bit as well as overall damage in some areas.
                I mean...are you sure that beginner and intermediate players are the ones who do the turtling? I would much rather say that advanced and pro players tend to turtle way more and beginners and intermediates tend to learn strings and flowcharts and spam them all the time.
                    Its about 50/50 in my experience. Its not that beginners are blocking everything it just that i noticed that some tend to slowly back walk away instead of trying to attack. As in i would do a clearly unsafe option and they just back walk and avoid interaction. I dont know how beginner Jins ive played that just back walk and the moment i go for an interaction demon paw or Bryan u4. Now it could just be my luck or region but about 85% of my online matches are overly defensive players both beginner and intermediate, 5% intermediate/advanced spammers, and the rest are a mixed grab bag of players who kinda what they are doing.
                        I have a totally different experience, honestly. Beginners are overly aggressive and tend to mash even when they're heavily under frames or they throw the most unsafe but flashy move. Intermediates tend to keep the distance and approach with safe moves like Jin's ff2 because it is actually a more "thought through" way to play the game. Advanced and pro players usually pick you apart with movement usually using only ultra-safe strings and pokes.
        It's a problem, even in heat, imo. I don't understand, why Reina (3+4, 4, 4) or Victor (expulsion) can just press a "free damage" button and chip me for like 20 damage with barely any ways to counterplay them safely and reliably.
            at least chip cant kill you. i know the situation you're talking about, though. 

In MK11 you could get heroic chip out, which is just a fancy way of saying you died to a safe block strong with 0 counter play.
            I mean Victor's Explosion is -17 on block or something like that, so even if you take chip damage you can get that health right back simply by punishing that same Explosion which is an unsafe move.
                not in heat it's not, it's safe during heat
        Yes. Just yes.
        I kinda get why it works outside of heat to counteract health regain, but I think they should nerf chip till its the same or slightly worse than health regain cause that would incentives attacking without making blocking bad
        Or rage or something.  Also why is totally normal damage recoverable what are the rules what is happening
            Juggles and OTGs leave recoverable health. Its really not that complicated lol
                Idk if I can give you "it's not that complicated"
        Heat is where you heal chip damage.
    Chip damage itself isnt bad. Its the huge ammount of chip damage that some moves have. Like victors explosion in heat. Chip damage should only deal 1 to 5 points in my opinion
        Honestly, the amount of chip damge should be scaled by howsafe or unsafe the move is on block. The safer it is the less chip damage it would do.

So, something like Drags running 2 would do extremely low chip damage, while Claudios wr2 should do a bit more than that simply because it can be ducked.
        I think the chip damage would be fine if combo damage was scaled back and everythingelsewasbalanced. Even though he is hard to win with, Leroy, for example,  feels fair. Low single hit damage, fast hitting chip from chain punches, better than average combo damage. Zafina feels off however, with mid single hit damage, trash combo damage, and her best chip moves damaging her.
    It'd make sense for moves that have an obvious or easy counterplay (unless opponent's in a corner for example), have long startup or are otherwise difficult to hit often. Instead they gave chip damage to super oppressive wr move, which with little practice you can spam up close and opponent's counterplay is 2-step at least with tight timing. It's like giving kazuya a 12f knd 50/50. Minimum downsides, maximum reward. And to think they haven't adjusted it since launch is even more bs, while some companies can basically change balance in their hands every week or so.
    I agree with this, but it's also not even in my top 5 complaints for this game which should tell you how much I dislike the gameplay.
        I'm in the same boat that there are other things that bother me more than chip. As a Claudio player though my strings are like 2/3 hit max. Reina/Hwaorang/Law etc they get like 6 hits in a row with safe strings. Interesting. 

anyways what are you biggest complaints? just curious.
        Scrub
            What rank are you hon?
                I'll go ahead and post the anonymous tekken player bitching flow chart

1\. "I'm GoD"

"No you're not you're lying"

2\. "I'm TGS"

"Wow not even GoD? I am, don't talk to me"

3\. "Any other rank"

"I'm (your rank+3), scrub"

regardless you're a scrub with a bitchmade mentality
                    Thank you for the meltdown, we all enjoy a good laugh 😂😂
                        That was a pretty wild ride, wasn't it? Lol. 

  
I hope he doesn't delete the comment chain, that was a hell of a train wreck.
                        Stay scrubby
                            Stay obese and miserable
                                project harder
                                    Why do you talk like an incel?
    I really liked how guilty gear ac went about making the game more offensive focused.  There was chip damage, but it was very very minimal.  In addition, there was meter that went up every time you blocked and went down every time you hit or got hit.  If the meter got too high, you would take way more damage on the next hit.

They balanced this (and the crazy blockstrings you could pull off in that game) with defensive options which cost meter like the dead angle attack, flawless defence, and slashback.
    To add to that why are there still characters who rely heavily on defense and punishing? What place does a character like Asuka have in the game for example when her entire gameplay has been based around being a turtle and punishing whiffs?
    chip damage makes sense in certain fighting games, as a way to discourage overly defensive and safe playstyles.

i'm a complete noob to tekken, but it feels like this game doesn't need it at all. playing too defensively seems like it would only be a losing strategy in this game

i guess the idea is that you are rewarded more for crouching/sidestepping/parrying attacks...but it still feels unnecessary. if it was only from heat then it would be different
        Nah. It's all about the launch punish, flash ducking, sidestep punish this time around. They only beefed up Parry for Azucena. Everyone else has to low parry or use their toned down version of a standing parry. 

But I can say that Paul's parries are still pretty much intact from T7. I have a friend who mains him.
        Well I'm no Tekken pro but I've seen enough pros playing in T7 tournaments to say that defense actually was the best strategy. Because block and whiff punishment and counter hits were (and still are) some of the most powerful tools a character and a player have. To know what you can punish and how is the greatest strength you can build as a player. 
To charge brainlessly with unsafe flow charts into a player who actually knows what he's doing is a death sentence.
    I don't mind chip damage at all. I just really want the heat engagers gone.
        That's not going to happen but they should probably adjust the frame advantage after. +17 is pretty crazy.
            Can you explain to me the frames on heat engagers? +17 should mean that i have a 17 frame move guaranteed after no? But its not like that right? Nothing is guaranteed after i do a heat engager?
                The opponent is in a forced block for 17 frames. They can't do anything but block.
                Like people have said, the opponent can still block and duck during those 17 frames. This kind of frame advantage is sometimes labeled as +17g where g I think stands for "guard" and many situations in the game have this, like Kazuya's df1,4 being +17g or something on hit and his db4 doing similar on counter hit, as opposed to Jin's 4 being a true +13 on ch and granting him guaranteed followups
                sometimes things that are +10 or more will still allow the opponent to block, it just depends on the moves. Heat Engagers always allow the opponent to block. You are right in your assumption that +17 should mean a 17 frame or faster move would hit, but tekken is complicated so it doesn't work that way in some instances.
                For most characters, their fastest move is 10f.

Being +17 means they cannot do anything else than block for the first 17 frames you can move. That means any move that's 26 frames or less (which is very slow) is uninterruptable.
                It means you can act 17 frames before your opponent can. It doesn't mean they can't block.
        I'm with you.... I don't mind chip damange.... the heat system should be adjusted though. The game is just so much more fun without it. Feels so good to put a heat engager in their place w out using them myself.
     it would he great if heat was a double edged sword, you recieve more chip but you also deal chip damage which lets people find openings on someone with heat and punish it
    The thing with chip damage in games is because usually there isn't really scary mix to begin with. Look at Street Fighter V or any Mortal Kombat game besides X.Tekken has many way to get opened up and launched
    chip damage is new donald trump
    sidestep, dodge or jump over. git gud
        Or do 3 all at once against Azucena, easy just get better l0l
            eeeezzzz
    I don't mind some chip damage, but it'd be better if it was relegated to very specific moves or pokes.
        It is…
            Yeah I want it reduced even further
    To encourage you to do something other than blocking
    not many moves do chip damage except heat and most I feel are negative on block .
    Without chip damage, Tekken 8 will just be a rehash of the defensive meta of Tekken 7.
    Chip is good because being able to just be a turtle is boring. You get temporarily punished with chip, but you get rewarded with health back by knowing when to go in and counter, or you just flush and lose it all if your offensive skills aren’t as good as your defensive skills. 

It’s a balancing act and a fighting game. If you’re a god at blocking and breaking throws, you shouldn’t be able to win by just getting one to two hits in and running the timer down.
        Except everything is +on block or safe so by the time it's your turn you already guessed wrong in one of 5000 50/50 situations and you've lost all that gray health. Then you try sidestepping and you get hit by a homing throw. Game is doodoo right now.
            its funny cause its mostly the safe and plus moves that chip
            You know why is the throw game so *weird*?? Like I get all the changes but they're incoherent.

I think making 1+2 break throws homing and all other throws *not homing* would be a cool move idk
            When a top tier like Drag or Jun puts you into the grinder at the wall, and even if you guess their mixups right on block (you can punish almost nothing cause everything is +), but they dont mind cause they chipping away my hp quite fast. The game literally makes you spam and discourage any calculated defensive play.
            Everything is + on block or safe? Lol, lmao even.
            I mean let's play through this scenario. Your opponent uses + moves on you several times in a row and at no point are you interrupting him, he has conditioned you. Then you guess a 50/50 wrong, whatever that's supposed to be (does not remove your grey health usually). Then you fail to break a throw that your opponent threw out because he predicted you would sidestep or further turtle up. Is your opponent not supposed to win that round?
        If I'm a god at playing good defensive Tekken, I shouldn't be punished by the game for playing against someone who can't break turtles. I'm fine with the game overall having less CHs in general to sit on, to allow for more active engagements this time around, but offense is just way too oppressive and unnecessarily punishing right now, towards opponents who like to take their turns blocking for just about any reason. 

There needs to be a balance. Bamco needs to reward both styles of play.
            If you were a god at playing defensive Tekken, you should be able to sidestep/duck/low parry/interrupted at some point. Holding back and backdashing isn't good defensive Tekken. The issue is that there's some absurd moves in the game right now that track too well or are too plus where you don't have good options other than block. It's okay to be punished for blocking and rewarded for avoid attacks.
                This would be true if this game wouldnt be a 50/50 spam fest. You can learn strings and stuff but it all goes out of the window if you just have to guess.
                >implying the gods of defensive Tekken have been able to consistently sidestep/duck/low parry/interrupt things when it matters most to win them games. Except it doesn't.

Seems like you're missing the whole point. Strong defensive Tekken is not as well rewarded as it should be. Playing well in Tekken 8 is constantly attacking to run your game and making sure the other player isn't allowed to attack, or play the game. Blocking is important for other things aside from just deciding to turtle up and bait CHs.

"the issue is that there's some absurd moves in the game right now that track too well or are too plus where you don't have good options other than block"

So you agree with me. Offense is too oppressive and too punishing towards defensive players. You're being punished for blocking not because of chip damage, but because you're forced to constantly take mixups and are put into disadvantageous situations where you're just blocking. Not turtling, not trying to run out the clock. Just. Blocking.

That's the problem.
        One of the posts in here that I saw said that chip damage is okay as long as it mostly happens in Heat Mode and not normal play, and I agree. That's where I stand on the issue mostly.
    if you were blocking punches in real life, would you be able to block them forever without taking any damage? You can’t just infinitely block everything
        If it was real life, Kuma's 1 jab would decapitate you.
            I don’t know if you understand, but what makes real world fights engaging to watch (mma) is seeing you wither down a defending opponent, obviously not everything is going to be realistic, but the idea that you can’t just put your guard up forever is what creates engagement, that’s why when people watch muay thai, or boxing, they’re interested in how much damage someone incurred through leg kick checks or blocking punches. I think chip is necessary, but dodges should be more powerful.
                I actually really enjoy combat sports (mostly MMA but also some boxing), so I appreciate what you're saying, in that there's a rich combination of factors that make analyzing a fight enjoyable.

What I would offer you is that a fighter breaking down their opponent's defense is usually achieved by how effectively they can bypass the opponent's guard - going for the body, kicking the legs. You usually have to hit your opponent somewhere other than his guard in order to make your exertion worth it. In Tekken this is simulated by fast pokes that are easy to land but do just a little damage.

In real life, I would argue that a person who is effectively able to check every one of his opponent's attacks will have the advantage, all else being equal. If I check three hard low kicks I expect your leg is going to hurt more than mine, but I wouldn't want my opponent in game to take (gray health) damage just by me blocking their lows - it's more interesting and skillful that I have to select and apply an appropriate punish rather than damage just being awarded.
I wish we could go back to the times where people could share their opinions without others feeling like their enjoyment in the subject is directly impacted by said opinions. Who fucking cares if a bunch of people don’t like the game you like? Why does that affect you so much to the point you don’t like the game as much yourself? It’s completely insane to me that too many of yall let the opinions of others sway your enjoyment THAT much
    Sadly in modern world the word of influencers matters a lot. For competetive games the influencers are the top gamers.
        It’s a damn shame, you hate to sound like an old man yelling at a cloud but this shit really didn’t start until the social media generation, not to this level
    Come on, let's not kid ourselves.  What's going to happen to a competitive game trying to get traction if you look it up and all you see is the top players saying it sucks ass?
        You take their opinion in mind but form your own? Like you should with any opinionated thing in life? The game very well might not be appealing to legacy competitive Tekken players, why should that affect your decision to try it out the competitive aspect of Tekken? You might like what they don’t like about it. 

I wouldn’t had played or experienced half the things in life that I enjoy a lot of if I listened to people who said it wasn’t good or fun. It’s absolutely ridiculous that people let others dictate their thoughts and opinions so much these days. 

It’s okay to like what everyone doesn’t and it’s okay to not like what everyone does.
            That's fine for people already playing the game.  The point is more that nobody new is going to try it if all they hear from the recognized figures in the game's community is "this game sucks!"  Your time is limited and most people are going to try things because they heard other people like them, not because they heard people say they suck
                How many casuals even know about Knee and Arslan? I mean T7 sold like 10M~11M copies. Like the most viewed T7 vid is the Arslan vs Knee at 2.2M views after 4 years even if we assume twice as many people will see their tweets that would still be less than half all the people who ever played T7 knowing about them.
            there is an infinate number of things to do in your free time. i could practace tekken 8 or i could detail my car. if the people why play it the most say its bad why would i even waste my time?
        If you ignore the flaws of something because you're afraid of it failing, they have no incentive to fix the flaws.

Namco knows what'd happen. If they deserve to be in their position, they'd make changes to stop it happening.
        Tekken isn’t trying to get traction. It already has traction. It is widely considered the most complicated and competitive fighting game.
            T8 is like...lightyears far from a competitive game.
                That’s complete bs and you know nothing about competitive games then.
                    Haha sure:), when movement doesnt work, when throws are tracking and unbreakable on ch, when you skip neutral with so many brainless easy tools, when you force 5050 with no risk etc. Youre living in the past where tekken WAS kinda competitive, youre like those who atill calling Shaheen a honest character, its T8 baby, the game where option select is part of the past.
                        Just because Tekken 8 is more aggressive doesn’t mean it’s not competitive. And 50/50s always have a degree of risk because if you block the low you are almost always getting combo’s for 70+. You can reduce the amount of 50/50s with good movement. If you do 20 dmg to your opponent and they haven’t done any you can just stand back and force them to come to you. Movement doesn’t work? More like you don’t know how to move. Movement literally got buffed from T7. Homing throws are a bit annoying but you can also just duck. Tekken has always been a mixup oriented game. Most characters aren’t that brainless except for about 5 characters. The game has also been out for only 3 months. T7 had 2 years of balance tweaks before it arrived to console. If any changes need to seriously be made, we’ll see them after Japan EVO once the devs can see what current behavior is busted in competitive play. Especially if they see half the cast play Azu.
                            Yeah , i dont know how to move  yet eddy powercrush hit me on his back, and I blocked drag's wr2 when I was litteraly on his back , got hit by Ninas F1+2 when I was on her back and endless similar situations, movement is litteraly trash, and even more trash due to hitboxes being buffed ( the problem is the new hitboxes and not the movement probably). Also some 50/50 are 0 to none risk especially on heat. This game wants you to just throw bs overtuned moves like reinas 3+4,4,4 or victors u1+2 , those with other dozens of braindead "just throw" and hope for the best. Game is currently objectively shit on the competitive scense. Also heatsmashes , the vest just throw and hope for the best, has weird evasiveness and tracking, ghost range, free 5050 on block for snowball, if you manage to step some of them, gl punishing it due to forward momentum, way way too much reward for 0 risk. This game is a joke currently. Its fun though at least not against the top 8 characters.

P.s - dont forget that mr.Murray once said "why would you move when you can just block anf punish" this became real in this game with its casino unescapable 50/50 and random tracking of neutral killing moves like mishimas demon paws, dvj uf1 , lilis df3+4 etc... just random full screen tracking.
                                Must powercrushes are steppable. Drag’s WR2 is steppable. Reina’s 3+4,4,4 is annoying but is punishable with a 12f or can get rekt by a well timed mid. Expulsion is literally launch punishable, it just forces crouch so it’s got to be a WS combo. Some of the tracking in the game is a bit rough. Demon Paw is a good example. And aside from characters like Azu and Drag there is a fair amount of counterplay. People love to toss around the term casino but anyone with a strong kbd can force a fair amount of whiffs, or an armor can interrupt some 50/50s.
                                    Powercrushes are steppable, but everything randomly tacking in this game. Wr2 is steppable too  but why did I block it when I was 180° to the actual diraction?3+4,4,4 -8 on blick and explusion -4 in heat(imo the dumbest buffed move rn, you litteraly have to block it cuz its tracking and full screen) basivclly punishing you for blocking, or even worse, eating a full combo damage from 1 move thats safe.  With all the randomness rng based bs that occures in this game its shit, also when you manage to sidestep a certain move or string the whiff punish may whiff for no reason , there are some consistant interactions, also random camera changes makes a df2 punish into db2 for example, this game is so far from being solid enough to start talking about competitive gameplay.
            7 was 8 not so much
Knee being the GOAT like always
It feels like him and Arslan had similar sentiments and similar responses after a bit of time. They probably saw a lot of backlash about being too negative. He puts it well, he’s relying a lot on legacy knowledge and it’s biting them in the ass. 

Them saying they should try to adapt is more positive way of acknowledging the franchise is changing without dragging the entire community down. I’m sure they’re aware people look to them to for their opinions, and being negative for so long is not good for them or the community. Especially since the last installment was around for over 10 years and it hasn’t even been a few months with this one. The game is basically still a baby. It’s going to change.
    Have fun „adapting“ to 50/50 mixups. Wonderful
        Have fun having the balance of a game live rent free in your head. Try doing something else for a bit. It’s better for your health. Or just keep banging your head on your keyboard. Whatever.
            "Hey I like this franchise but don't like how they skewed it towards 50/50 mixups i hope they change it" GAMES RENT FREE IN UR HEAD LOSER GO TOUCH GRASS LOL. 

Just because someone has a different opinion to you doesn't mean they are raging and it consumes them lol
Mans just received a letter from Bamco lawyers lmao
    More like a cheque
        Yup, the more I think about it. This is likely to happen.  
You can never have too much money playing tekken as a career.
    Are you really so scared of lawyers that you think they are capable of legal action against someone sharing an opinion? Like, how much power do you think they have?
        did lawyers tell you to write this?
            I think they're a lawyer themselves. Sounds awful lot like something that a lawyer, that doesn't want the common folk to know the extent of their power, would say.
            Did you write this because you were scared of a lawyer?
                The lawyers are on to us we gotta koreanbackdash out of here
                    Oh no dude, you put me on p2 side! 

wavuwavuwavuwavuwavu
        https://preview.redd.it/a9p16fllr8vc1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=2dc3a39b9573e7f07cd3cc0e31226dbfabc04760
        They are capable of threatening someone who shared an opinion, and unless you can fight back, and spend time on it, its almost always better to retract. They know, they won't win in court, they don't need to take it to court.

Of course, I don't think Bamco's lawyers are involved here lol.
            They have nothing to threaten Knee with here...
                They're lawyers, they 100% know some yakuza dudes. Knee is probably held hostage and the bandai namco yakuza department wrote that tweet.
                    You know what, I 100% believe you
                I'm not denying that, but don't tell me you've never come across a lawyer threatening a meaningless lawsuit around flimsy logic. My company had received a summons for piracy when they had zero proof we used their product. We were one of the few that could fight back, so we challenged them and put them in their place. But a lot of others settled because they had threatened a lot and asked for so less. 

Also, we were one of the few that didn't actually use their industry standard software.
                    And you think it's a likely scenario that Bamco lawyers are going after Knee because he is a struggling member of the lower class who can't fight back?
                        Bruh, Just saying lawyers can and will make issue if they are asked to do so. You want proof ? Just check out John Oliver's case. And no, Knee is not bigger than John Oliver. 

A random ass libel suite. One year later the case was dismissed. But guess what, his insurance went up, and damage was done. AND THIS WAS FOR A SEGMENT ON SLAPP LAWSUITS.

I'm not implying that there were any lawyers involved in this Knee statement lol. Bamco aren't stupid, nor do they have any reason to do so. However, if, and again, IF they did want to, you can bet that they can cause more than enough trouble for said person to retract their statements. Especially because said persons livelihood depends on being associated with their game.
                            And you think the John Oliver case, where he is talking about SLAPP lawsuits, is comparable to this situation where Knee is saying he doesn't like the Tekken metagame?
                                If you think a corporate lawyer cannot touch you, for an innocent statement like what Knee made, then you haven't met enough of these guy my man. That's all I'm saying. Most lawyers do what they do, to make your life hard, and have you submit. Nothing more than that, they don't even want to go to court.

Anyways, I'm not implying Bamco did anything here. And this pretty much useless discussion has run its course. Its naive you think you can't be sued for something you didn't do. You absolutely can, and a lot of times, even people as big and backed up as international celebrities are made to pay, on a case that has zero merits whatsoever. So unless you live in a state / country with good anti SLAPP laws or some version of it, you're fully liable to be bullied. Its a hard fact to accept, but it goes on every single day around the world.
                                    I am not saying people don't get frivolous lawsuits. I am saying the threat of a frivolous lawsuit is not there in this situation. There is nothing to work with.
Dude's not wrong either. I understand they reward aggressiveness more than ever, but damn, it's like there's no defensive strategy to this game whatsoever anymore.
He shouldn't have to apologise, yet here we are
    He said it wasn't fun and that's fine it's his opinion. Unfortunately people online love to argue over who is wrong or right. Everything is a masterpiece or completely shit to some people. It's annoying.
        I think he's not quite used to his personal opinion having so much influence, especially on a global scale with social media. So good on him that he's beginning to recognize it.
            That might be it too.
    I think he’s sorry for not expanding on his opinion knowing how many he influences,

When you have that kind of influence you need to say what you mean from the get go; it’s very hard to walk back on statements that were taken more negatively than they were meant to be
    He's only apologizing because people are quick to use his opinion as validation of their own. This just turns into this negative spiral that affects the FGC even outside of Tekken sphere.
        People were using his (and other pros) opinions as ammunition to shit on the game. Shitting on the game relentlessly does nothing but hurt the game. Critisize, for sure, but if all you're doing is shouting from the rooftops about how fucking shit Tekken is and it's never going to be fixed, it's going to turn people away from coming into the game and that is a BAD thing long term.

It's just stupid you can't say anything positive about the game or be hopeful without being labelled a dickrider or shill for Bandai/Harada. It's like man, I know the game has problems but I still enjoy it and think it can be amazing.
            I feel the same.  It's like opinions have to be definitive instead of fluid.  I don't think that's what Knee was doing but people used his post as you said for ammo.  It's never the game needs some tuning and it will get better.  It seems to always be the game is broken and Namco has no ability to make adjustments.
            It's definitely not shit. It's just severely unbalanced right now and favors rushdown characters too much. But that's nothing that can't be fixed. That the game is crammed with a cynical business model and lazy content is a different issue, however...
                It's also pit a bad taste in people's mouth by having 3 different types of monetisation post launch with no notice. Their is a distrust, and rightfully so.
            To be fair people spent money on this game and don't have to be happy about anything.  So people have the right to be drama queens about this, especially with what happened with MK1 and Now T8 is running into some of the same issues and all this was after SF6 came out that they should've learned from.
                No being a shithead is just being a shithead whether you paid for it know doesn't justify the constant. Oh, this game is shit I'm right your wrong, oh knee said something negative see I was right.

It's all dumb, criticise don't bitch
I don't know when this community became nothing but bitching but God its exhausting.

Those things ruin the community as well, it makes people not want to engage with the community.
Every one bitching about every character makes people not want to play x character.

This community needs to take a breath and decide if they want the game to get better or just fail because right now it feels like a lot of people just want to see it fail which to me if you like tekken is weird.
                    Being a shithead is being a shithead, and being a unfun game is being an unfun game.  I'd always rather people speak on how they feel than just pretend to like something.  That's how we end up with mediocre games.   I don't see anyone saying they want the game to fail, that's not even the conversation right now.  

  
The only people I see wanting it to fail are those who pretty much got played with the sneaky battle pass they added after the game is out like capcom did.  IN that they have every right to be angry.
            Exactly, and I think that may be why Knee posted this clarification. The dude absolutely loves Tekken, and the last thing he would want would be for people to use his comments to support their vehement and relentless trashing of the game. I swear it feels like some people here actually want the game to fail, and there's no way Knee would want to encourage or validate that kind of sentiment.
            Holy shit they get it! Crazy how this subreddit of all places seems to actively want it to fail......
        Was especially funny considered that 99% of the players that felt validated by it are not even close to playing the same game as knee. His tekken is not your tekken. He is complaining about things most of these clowns dont even comprehend and they all just sitting their nodding their head because they just lost to someone spamming a duckable string on them 5 times in a row.
    He's probably getting harassed in DMs. That's the simplest answer.
    It’s ridiculous how much shit people will get for sharing valid and thoughtful criticism. Not everyone is an English major, someone doesn’t have to make a double spaced 10 page dissertation on what they don’t like in a game for it to be valid criticism. You got rando Jim trying to discredit and shame fucking Knee of all people because they love the game and he doesn’t.  It’s insane it’s come to this point.
        Remember that foreign language review that Harada called out for calling the game's DLC "P2W"? And the community got so angry that it was taken down and replace with a positive review?

Here we are 3 months later. 

The #1 character is DLC Eddie.

And a pro player who's primary language is not English is also having every word picked apart and analyzed with whatever context people want to apply to it.
    Toxic positivity trying to kill integrity and honesty once again. This sub is full of it
        Toxic positivity overtook the OW playerbase when 5v5 was announced and now Overwatch 2 is bleeding players at a faster rate than ever. People are so terrified of public opinion turning on their favorite game that they put their fingers in their ears and shout "LA LA LA I can't hear you!" when valid criticism comes up. The responses in the previous Knee thread weren't blind pessimism, everyone seemed to be pointing out specific issues and how they could be changed.

I haven't even played T8 due to injury so I have no clue whether the game is good or bad. I know from watching what happened to OW2 though that it's going to be bad for T8 long term if half the playerbase keeps trying to dismiss any criticism bc of the short-term effect it has on public perception.
            > I know from watching what happened to OW2 though that it's going to be bad for T8 long term if half the playerbase keeps trying to dismiss any criticism bc of the short-term effect it has on public perception.

on the flipside, it's going to be bad for T8 long term if people only see the community shitting on the game. which is what it currently looks like as someone who isn't super into tekken. i've seen one example of toxic positivity and about 400 posts saying that tekken 8 is a trash game that can't be redeemed
                Naw it'll be okay,  SF5 and T7 got crapped on a lot and were still okay in the long run.   Besides the hardcore don't really care so long as money is on the line, and casuals don't really care so long as what they have works.  That's the problem here, even for hardcore and casuals there's some real bad problems with the game.
        Have you been on this sub in the last two months? Are you seriously going to claim it's overall positive on the game?
            There is a huge storage of copium over there, at that Justin Wong post. You might wanna check that out before discussing the curious nuances of the concept of "overall opinion", which you're clearly lacking
                Right, it hasn't been nothing but hating for months. Maybe look at the sub before you make claims about it.
"I didn't expect my opinion to become such a big topic. It's been three months since Tekken 8 was released, and it's clear that the game delves into new depths.

Tekken 8 demands quick learning, which differs significantly from simply mastering techniques to defeat your opponent.

What disappointed me was realizing that the legacy knowledge and strategies I've honed over years of playing Tekken weren't effective anymore. The game seems to heavily favor offense over defense; blocking costs you health, which feels like a punishment rather than a strategic move.

Perhaps this shift reflects the direction of modern gaming, and maybe I'm just showing my age! It's challenging to create a game that pleases everyone.

I'm not asking Bandai Namco to cater exclusively to pro-level players, but I believe Tekken 8 could be even better with some adjustments. While my initial reaction may seem negative, I'm willing to adapt to the new meta and find enjoyment in Tekken 8. After all, I love the game and will strive to embrace its changes.

Apologies for sounding pessimistic about the game's recent release."

They need to turn down chip damage bro
    Chip damage should've remained a kicharge perk.
I could get behind punishing blocking in Tekken if they had made movement much better than it currently is, like at least T5 levels, but no, everything is tracking so you just have to take that 50/50...
    Yeah, its BORING.
I mean unfortunately it's just kind of how it is with games in general. Not to sound like an old lady screaming at clouds, but games in general have just gotten faster and more aggressive over time. A lot of people have that moment where something just clicks and it doesn't feel right anymore. It's not some tangible thing where you can just pin it down with a finger and say it's this exact change.

It's a gradual movement on a lot of different fronts.
    I wish I could pinpoint what point in time hame devs decided “fast and aggressive” is the way to make multiplayer games.
I’m not pro at all and after the initial ‘wow this is so cool’ eventually wore off, the game became fucking boring very fast. I stopped playing over a month ago now. 

Got my monies worth out of it for sure, so I’m not mad or salty or anything. Just so tiring when everyone is a rush down spam lord. And aggression, lockdown, and forced 50/50s are what wins most games.

Man is speaking facts, and it isn’t just at the pro level either.
    yes, that's what people are missing about the game - it's BORING after a while.
        Cuz the best part of high level tekken ,even decent ranked player are the footsies and neutral play (pokes+movement pressure) its the exciting part imo ,also having good defense(movement which is way worse now) and punishment, it feels kinda extinct mostly.
    It's poorly designed all around but the new school players mostly don't understand this because they are being fed wins they dont deserve. It's grating and exhausting losing to coin flips and shows no mastery what so ever.
        I agree completely and the moment I got to purple ranks in Tekken 8 and was still being matched with super aggressive button mashers was really the moment that it hit me.

A fair chunk of these players in upper red/lower purple, they wouldn't have made it out of yellow/orange ranks in Tekken 7. More than once I have said out loud 'how are you even in this rank omg', while I'm fighting someone that refuses to stop pressing buttons. 

It's kinda sad to see really. I was hoping to be playing T8 off and on for quite a few years. Sadly it seems that this new iteration and direction is just not aimed at me.
@ Knee, end your message with "Sorry for the negative opinion as it's just been released.", if your being held hostage in Haradas basement.
why the fuck is he apologizing for a "negative" opinion?
    He is probably seeing a lot of people take his quote out of proportion, and he is trying to reassure people that it's not as bad as people are taking it.
    Namcops called
    Bc people on the internet get offended by anything that isn't kisses in the butt about the things they like
all im saying is who thought power crush + heat was a good idea
    Blame the new intern.
Bro got that phone call lol.
    He got a phone call to call himself an old fuck on social media? Yeah makes total sense
Great response. Respect on his name
This reads like it was written at gunpoint. 

I assume he was just taken aback by how many his tweet blew up
I felt the exact same way in previous Tekkens learning Drags iWR2 and Steves duck cancel. Wasted all that time practicing just to get a slight advantage or have cool looking combos only to have them rendered useless/less effective, not to mention the new dlc characters that would always be OP with braindead gameplay. Glad I never bought T8
    I actually feel bad for steve,claudio,drag,law mains who mastered their hard shit for years only to make all these shit accessable for newcommers, also as nina player, there is no reason to do butterflies , they are useless now, also lili's dew glide cancels that also hard af, just no reason for this.
...please buy the skins too they are cool. Thanks, please send  help.
I've never heard of this guy until yesterday (I'm a total Tekken noob) but goddamn this makes me respect them.  We need more of this attitude in the world.
What's wild in these comments is people being like yeah he really didn't know what he was talking about.... Is there anyone in these comments who have won a world tournament in tekken? It appears so from the way some of you are acting like you're just a god at the game and adapted just fine to the changes. This washed world champ just gotta learn the match up? Get out of here
Bamco ninjas are at bros neck🤣 

But seriously, it is good that knee and other pros are realizing the impact that their opinions have on the community and public in general about the game. Tekken 8 is not a bad game, and people need to realize that just because the game is different, then what they want doesn't make it bad. This is not to say 8 doesn't have its issues, but complaining that they have moved to a more aggressive format for this particular Tekken is not in itself bad... especially when it's one of the more popular tekkens and probably could be the most popular one if given time to improve...
    The issue isn't that they moved how the game plays. Its that it wasn't done with much thought in mind. There's a loads of problems with how the new systems interact with the underlying Tekken dynamics that just don't make sense. So its not the what was done, but the how it was done.

The issue is though the games been out for 3 months and we barely have any real meaningful changes to things that matter. On top of issues like plugging still being an issue which you would think would be a top priority to fix in the game, instead of making a hit list in excel.
    T8 is a good game as a package, but a terrible fighting game and even worse as a competitive game.
    LMAO
The bottom line is they made what was a highly technical game that appealed to few, into a not very technical game that appealed to many.
    You mean the game that moved 11.8 million units? I agree. It didn’t appeal to enough people.
        Sold 11.8 million units but has a higher percentage player drop of rate in 3 months then Tekken 7? Is clear the intention was to make money with this game with cinematic easy to play mechanics then retain players long term. 

When the newbies who get better at the game become veteran players and are left with the core mechanics of thr game after a year or two they will see the issue to and see the layer of depth pulled from thr game because as you become higher level you want higher depth. It's what rewards you to keep going and get better. You can only steam roll someone soo much before it stops being fun.
            Yep, fully agreed.
    Tbh Tekken 7 was out for ten years and that time meant players weren’t used to new games coming out that are a response to the perceived issues with the previous game. It is particularly common for devs to nerf or change the strong defense options that arise when a game has been out for so long it has been “solved”.
    They want that worldwide money
First I read about Arslan "ok I will be a good boy and learn" now this, nicely done Namco, keep the money flowing.
    Namco didnt do shit, the community called them out on it. As many people that agree with them, the same amount of people were talking back at them.
        In case you didn't notice, I was joking, I have no idea if they got money or not, neither you know or anyone else, but influencers (I believe we can call them like that) have impact big enough that it's in publisher business to take good care of them, right? Simple logic, if I could pay someone who is followed by many, I would pay because it's beneficial to me, so... we don't know, but somehow both top players change their mind, IDK man, weird coincidence ;)
Good for Knee for being honest at least: One problem is that defense punishes you so old defenses don't work.  The other is dude admitting old tactics don't work anymore that have worked for years
    Right , powercrushen8 to armor their attacks and steal your turn with dumb move named heatburst, you cant hold back, you have to press something to steal your turn (mashen8), you cant even move out of pressure cuz thats also tracken 8, fun game indeed.
        It's all counter striking as opposed to just blocking

An actual reason to not like the game is that they simply just gave some dudes incredibly good tools and not others so like many fighting games you just see the same dudes over and over.  Even then though, the usage data has a better spread then a lot of games

Then there is the scummy monetization which is actually pretty fucking stupid
after this era of tekken is done, ppl will pray for more “defensive” options. it’s coming
YOU CAN'T EVEN CHICKEN!!! A TRIED AND TRUE ADVANCED TEKKEN TECHNIQUE. IF YOU CAN'T REVERSE THE REVERSAL... YOU'RE LIVING IN THE PAST! 🤣 🤣
I mean it'll change overtime I feel like. The Meta and the game as a whole. 


Look at T7, it released in arcades first to iron out creases and when it was (more or less) balanced, then it released on console. It's been 7 (technically 9) years  since a Tekken game came out and arcades aren't that big outside of Asia anymore. WE'RE the beta testing arcades.
T7 season 4 and T7 season 1 are almost polar opposites of each other. So I give like a few more months to a year the "balance" and (probably) overall game will feel completely different and for the better (hopefully).

But yeah I agree, it's times where chip damage for example can feel too much especially if you're playing against something like a Dragunov who's going full monkey. It's not a bad idea per se, but it could've been implemented better. It's probably here to stay, but chip damage I'd change it to where it's only on certain moves DURING heat versus only being on certain moves and then on everything in heat.
    Balance can be made,  o balance will change their philosophy of "aggressivu gampelay" and no thing will be changed when dumbfuck Murray said," just block, why would you ever sidestep".
"only reward in attack and no reward in defense", one thing that does really annoy me about the game is when I get a read on or react to a particularly dangerous low for example and my reward is a 10f punish if i'm lucky, it might not even be a punish it might even be safe and i just get to attack first but only if I use a jab.
    Any ‘dangerous’ low is almost always guarantee launch punishable excl dumb shit like jin d2 being -12 LMAO
        jins d2 is a prime example of what im talking about
             it’s the only example unless u can name another low that is ch launchsble and is -12
T8 is that one “fight back” meme. 
No protection just endless pressure😭
bamcops called
Remember folks, this is the internet. There is no such thing as nuance
    Bro, the internet practically fetishizes the notion of nuance. T8's problems aren't complicated and they're self-evident.
Chip damage while blocking and heat mode are the main problems that make Tekken 8 too offensive based. There's not as much strategy anymore. I get what they were going for, but it wasn't executed as well as it could have been. You can attract casuals while still catering to high level players.
I love tekken 8 but I also wish their was a modern Tekken 5/6 without rage arts, heat etc.

I recently went back to play 6 and wow is it fun, I played tekken since 1 but never really got good til tekken 7 so don't think I really understood how good the older tekkens were til now.

  
\* Shorts / fast combos with heat / walls not being a huge extension so you arn't waiting a long time just because you got launched makes he game feel soo much faster, its also insanely fun as a kaz main that you can keep aggressive 50 50's up even if he doesn't have ff 4

\* no rage art / heat means even when opponent is low hp you don't suddenly have to worry about losing 30-40% because you overextended into a rage art

  
\* movement feels so crisp and nothing seems overly cheap, when I get hit I made a mistake plain and simple.

  
while I am very happy with 8 I can see why so many legacy players think tekken has went in the wrong direction.
The Bamco glazers literally bullied this man into apologizing for an opinion fr 💀
Namcops got him
I wasn't a pro like he is but as an old Tekken player I 100% agree with every word he said.

But tbh Im not mad about T8 because I still think it's a good game and it's a good thing that they decided to take a different road.
Good guy Knee. An Iron Fist is there ever was one 👊
To be fair defense does feel like shit sometimes
A player willing to adapt is a player to be feared.
I hope everyone is taking notes on how to criticize your game without flaming out to oblivion and hurting the game. You can say "the game needs more fun defensive options" without saying "Tekken 8 is a dogshit game that deserves to fail" or "I don't like this as much because it doesn't suit my playstyle" instead of "Tekken 8 is not fun."

That said, it is totally fair to say "the tekken shop and this battle pass is bullshit and Namco should feel bad about it."
I honestly don’t mind the game. Just a little too button mashy for my liking. Wish I didn’t get punished for playing defensive
This man's humility is admirable. I wish I can absolutely be like him.
the GOAT
I'm glad he put this out because so many people were just using his original tweet as validation .
i appreciate knee's comments. he's accepting that he needs to change if he wants to continue to be great and he still likes tekken. i agree that the game does need some fixing, but i don't agree with him thinking that we've found the depths of tekken 8. the game is only 3 months old, and people act like it's been out for 3 years.

anyway, there's certainly a new way a player has to think about this game if they want to be successful, but it's possible. in SF every new game features drastic changes, yet the great players are able to accept the changes and perform well. there's something to be said about not expecting the games you play to cater to you, the developers have the right to do what they want with their game. to adapt, you have to understand that you have to do things you may not want to do to get the job done. i think knee will be right back on top as usual, though it may take him a year or 2 like in tekken 7.

his take is easily the most level-headed from all the dissatisfied pros.
This is just politics. I never watch he expresses respect other players in Kr. U.S and Europe's Tekken fans do not know the truth. If you understand Korean and watch his streaming for a while, you finally get to know what Im saying. He has loyal fans in Kr, and his foolish fans always speaks ill of opponents and Knee never makes them stop disrespecting his opponents. When Ulsan won against him, he said, "Ulsan is good player but he has advantage from using Azucena." You know what ? Knee couldn't play like Ulsan. haha ridiculous. He used Feng and said "Feng is not strong." at Tekken 7 and always expressed disrespect against Atiff cuz he can's use Akuma like Atiff. hahaha

He hasn‘t WHAT
I'm a complete noob when it comes to fighting games, and I appreciate the game being more accessible for new players. But after playing for three months I can definitely feel the same frustrations as the pros, it feels like defense has zero value in the game, and blindly mashing is the pathway to free wins. I expected mashing to be less prevalent at higher ranks, but it just gets worse  and worse going into purple ranks and onwards
    Just a question, how does blindly mashing buttons result in wins? That’s the best way to get abused by knowledgeable players.
        Cause everyone isn’t a knowledgeable player.
            He said worse and worse going into purple ranks. I find that hard to believe.
                purple ranks are dogshit at the gaem 

rank inflation is super high in that gaem, purple ranks in t8 are like yellow ranks in t7
                Considering the spike in new players Tekken 8, the rampant plugging problem that only recently started becoming more manageable, and possibly a third problem I’m not aware of. It’s not impossible for it to be a problem of lacking knowledge.
                    There's no way button mashers survive the red ranks. They can probably reach red but that won't last long.
                        Just depends on how smart they are with button mashing. Most characters can kill in two launches/ combos.
                            But if they're being smart, that's no longer mashing. They're understanding the game now.
                                Hmm yes and no. I know what you mean as it is playing smarter but there’s still mashing in how it’s performed. Like with how Eddie is on his debut. Tons of people winning off of lack of knowledge and mashing a single button. When people say button mashing they don’t always mean random inputs. They just means a constant string of inputs.
                                    But if they still act when it's not their turn, they get punished. Like I said, there's no way mashers survive red, moreso purple.
    I have to disagree. I think defense is still incredibly important the higher you get. Blindly mashing can reward you at lower ranks potentially but the higher you get you’re just exposing yourself to getting launched twice and killed. It’s not a defensive oriented game but blocking is still crucial.
        Yeah ive made it to purples with a pretty defensive playstyle, i havent really bothered learning setups or abusing my plus frames and optimizing combos yet.
I will soon and see how it changes things but i want to keep climbing until i plataeu then work on those things. But ducking high strings and launching dumb shit and whiff punishing as gotten me pretty far on its own.
            Exactly. If you’re a bit patient in this game you can benefit from the stupidly potent offensive options.
                Part of the problem is your offense has to be just as good as your defense. Or your defense has to be leagues better to compensate now is how it feels to me. I tried playing defensively, and I still "try". But with all the bullshit going on, and just how much quicker people feel in next gen fighting games (maybe I'm just getting old) I find myself quickly saying "if I try to block and punish and lose the interaction TWICE I'm cooked. My best shot is to throw out my fastest/most unexpected combos." I feel as if I'd have to put 300 hours of defensive practice in against each character just to learn 1/3rd of the options I'd have to react to and feel any degree of comfort while on defense
                    Yeah that makes sense. I don’t think you even need to know the opposing character to any significant degree and react to every single move they throw with the perfect counter, but at a minimum if you can recognize when it’s not your turn because of a frame disadvantage for example that’s already a huge plus. I think a combination of safe moves leading to launchers, CHs, etc. is pretty effective.
                        Duly noted. Will keep add this to my notes and keep it in mind while practicing. Also want to add that I usually feel like I'm pretty decent at reading breaks and pauses and finding the right time to poke in and interrupt or punish. Just the more time I've spent on tekken the more I've realized I'm not that good at it. I get *really* messed up by players like Jun or a GOOD Zafina that either has natural fake pauses in their combos or is good at leaving enough time to make you think there's enough time to interrupt only to get CH Launched
        I have to disagree. Currently at Tekken King rank and man if it aint a huge mashfest. defense isnt really important to be honest, just dont mash when its heavily the opponents turn and sadly youre good to go. so many stances have insane evasion, kenpo is absurd (and the fact that they gave it to more characters, ugh.) all you gotta do is just rush your opponent down with insane plus frames, oh its finally your turn? No its not, heat burst. Chip damage is ridiculous. Defense doesnt work because one of the million forced 50/50s is eventually going to get you since theres practically no counterplay to many of them. im super frustrated so sorry if it sounds like im being a crybaby but this is just how i feel.
            I’m at King too and I don’t see the mash fest to be honest. Maybe we have different definitions of mashing lol. When I was lower ranked yeah I could see dudes just spamming all kinds of BS but here there is some calculation involved and timing when to do shit, generally speaking. 

I think where you said don’t mash when it’s heavily the opponents turn is key. That’s in effect defending. It’s a simple concept but a lot of people suck at doing that. So my point wasn’t that you should play defensively in general but that it’s extremely important to know when to block and when to attack especially in a Tekken where blindly throwing out moves can result in you losing half your life.
                You're playing King, bro lmao nobody will be mashing, no one wants to take a low ch that deals 50 damage or or a ch throw and then you die or heat smash that deals 60 damage.
                     tekken king rank, not king the character
                        Ah then my apologies, mate
                        For real though, is the guy blind? Cant he see you re a Gon main?
                            That elite 2 foot hit box!
        I agree, was stuck in reds but I realized that I have to block more. The more defense I incorporated in my game, the more success I got in my matches, esp the most annoying match-ups.
            Yeah and the great thing about simply blocking is that it gives you a chance to see how your opponent likes to play and then react accordingly.
    Can guarantee your complaints are not the same complaints as the pro’s considering this is your first tekken game. No offense but you probably can’t even react to snake edge. You probably get spammed by Drags W2. Your frustrations are a skill issue while the pro’s frustrations are an issue of “this doesn’t feel like the game i took years to learn.”
        The pros are complaining that defense is unrewarding in this game, which is literally the exact same complaint as the one I have. You're right, I might get caught off guard by a snake edge once, as I don't really expect people to use them in purple ranks. Don't know what a "W2" is, maybe you're referring WR2 which I find rather easy to sidestep.


I wish my frustrations were a skill issue since I enjoy learning and finding solutions to problems, but I feel like the solution to most challenges currently in the game is just being more relentless in your aggression than your opponent, which doesn't really take a lot of skill imo (and the pros seem to agree)
            You do not have fundamental defensive skills remotely good enough to judge how rewarding defense is in this game. 

Offense is stronger than defense in every game at lower levels because defense is inherently harder to learn. 

You don't know if defense is unrewarding in tekken 8. You are just trash. And so am I
                Ok, but most of the pros are saying that defense is unrewarding in T8. Are they just trash too?
                    Ppl are just trying to tell you that in your couple months timespan with the game, your defence is more than likely still pretty weak so you cant really grasp how good defence is not rewarding. 


If you were playing T7 u d still get blown up by opponent offense bc defence is harder to learn than offense in any game. But good defence can be learnt eventually, however its less rewarding in T8.
            You don’t “get” it
                And the pros don't get it either I'm guessing?
                    Nah they get it,you don’t
Have to adapt
I mean he’s not wrong. Neither was Arslan. I knew all of this would happen just based on the CNT and beta. 

I said this would basically be another Tekken 4 and look what happened. It’s Tekken 4 on steroids except everyone has a diluted JFLS. 

Backdashing and defense have been deprioritized. It’s been turned into a aggro jab fest. 

And the funny thing is I haven’t even played the game outside of 1 hour on the demo lmao. 

Maybe I’m also just an old legacy player. But goddamn Bamco deconstructed the pillars of Tekken and turned it into something else. 

But I guess it worked based on sales alone, right? Bottom line type of stuff.
Fight back knee don't let Namco win
The reward for defense is punishment.
Stand your ground! Tekken 8 is not fun. I play it to beat the ever loving snot out of someone and when that shit doesn't work I run like a bitch. I use Leroy and 90% of the time I'm watching this brother defy odds as he fights for his life. Going up against overpowered super heroes, devils, sword carrying assassins, mega bots and big ass bears! My fingers are so swollen guys. Tekken 8 has thrown defense out the window and now you have to keep mashing to win. Legacy skills and common fighting game knowledge is not needed on this sinking ship. Everytime I play Tekken 8, I end up hollering profanities into a pillow. If Tekken 8 was a playable character I'd keep punching it square in the face! I repeat Tekken 8 is not fun, it's an unbalanced class A substance that I can't quit.
Such a chad
I mean he's got a point. Tekken 8 is great, but could be even better with just a few tweaks like rebalanced heat mode, and an overall buff to movement
its funny to me that he just implied he can influence development
    I mean tbf he has. Just not with anything he’s posted but more of what he and other top players do in tournaments.
Knee is the goat, what a humble person, i would say  this fkn shit game is a total waste of my time atm with all the shit changes atm, like floor/wallbreak nerfs instead of just nerfing the heavens gate damage, the so bad gamepass with 0 content that is worth even 1Dollar. as i have hit God rank with bryan, i realized play the game with throws and safe moves is the way to climb ranks, with a tiny bit of defense,12f Ch Homing Throws.... yesss.. . this game atm the more you play it the worse it becomes, homing throws are so garbage, alot of powercrushes are so freaking op u rather wanna do safe high powercrush/throws and a safe mid all the time, the situations That are pure 50/50 is too rewarding and dumb as it will make the game insanely stressful,
Looks like the knees finally gave out.
Tekken 8 is not tekken.. the identity on what makes this tekken is not there anymore..
I love him
Knee being cool as usual
Bruh...
I agree with Knee, but his perspective and choosing to adapt is what elevates a players game. Throughout the coming months Tekken 8 meta is gonna change somehow with updates, patches, dlc characters so adapting is always the better choice.
I feel like they were for sure trying to make the game more appealing to watch. Like so many Tekken matches is scooting back and forth and turtling but apparently thats what a lot of people liked.
That's eerily similar to what Justin Wong said.

I wonder if Justin's tweet made Knee look back on his previous statements.
Bring back rage drives
He’s not wrong though. I’ve been playing competitively since tag2 and I’m struggling so much against players who I can see are just mashing most of the time.
Now that knee has spoken watch the changes for this game... Mark my words
Words of wisdom from the goat, MASKU!
My main thing about T8 is that I feel like side stepping was made way less effective
He is important for feedback, but it was actually my hwoarang's defense ( followed by punishment) has led me to climb higher than 7. Defense leading to offense is great in this game. Adjustments will be made, these people forget their own damn history too as they KNOW that balancing is gonna come and every previous modern Tekken has changed dramatically from its vanilla version. Quit the fucking doom posting on this sub lol
I said it multiple times. An easy balancing factor is if they went the Street Fighter 4 route and you could only choose to have Heat or Rage in a match. Only one or the other, or you can choose both but they’ll both be weaker, like the Rage damage boost is cut in half as well as Rage Art damage, and Heat duration and Heat Smash damage. 

Cuz it’s fucking ludicrous to have TWO comeback mechanics , each one dealing between AT LEAST 23-34% total health bar damage EACH, stacked on top of each other.
i think he has a point. hirada maybe used the ranking system to gauge what players enjoy doing most in the game. while it doesn't grant u the win often, being aggressive and totally destroying someone is fun. but its a skill reward. one thats now a mandatory with the chip damage system. that said i havent played and still want to try it out  probably when all the dlc characters are out. hopefully they brink Lidia back and were just trying things out with her in 7. like with akuma.
Tekken reddit was just dick riding the last tweet a few days ago and now y'all 180'd after knee explained himself. Y'all are jokes
Finally some accountability and positivity
Sad times where you have to justifiy not liking shit...
That's my goat
I'm really a noob at Tekken, but in my opinion, the voices of pro players must be much more valuable for developers than possible newcomers. Pro players also bring in more audience, i personally started playing because of Rangchu, lol. I know, I know, it's all about profit. But it's a shame that legends like Knee must play a game they don't like.
This game is a garbage. I want a refund. And I don't care that I've played for more than 100 hours.
and that's how a tekken legend is forced to apologise to twitter's 12yr olds for not enjoying the kusoge state of t8
He shouldn't have to apologize for giving a valid opinion that many people share. While this doesn't apply to everyone, many are on the "just adapt bro" bandwagon because T8 is still in the get away with brain dead gimmick phase, where flow charting can net you wins and the thought of that going away scares the hell out of some people because we all know darn well there are many people in the Tekken God plus ranks that have no business being there. People have every right to enjoy or not enjoy the game without someone getting butt hurt over an opinion that doesn't sync with their own.
Props to Knee.

As it stands I think T8 has major issues. The oppressive lockdown offense and potential to spam indefinitely with heat is incredibly off putting to me. Add to that the never ending combos, long ass rage arts, the chip and recoverable health with heat, the overtuning of every character, etc.

Been playing this less and less. I miss the simpler mechanics of T7 even though it certainly had its issues.
I kinda agree with him, maybe there should be a legacy game mode or something, that'd be nice
reminder that pros make fun of y’all for acting like you relate to what they’re saying lol
Dude gave his humble opinion about the current state of game and still feels like he needs to publicly apologize just because, when he in fact did nothing wrong.

Knee is the real deal.
People should stop this nonsense.

PS: All the professional-level players will adapt to the new environment, sooner or later.
Honestly, T8 has been a lot of fun for me. I've been playing this series since Tag 1, but the games got boring when all you had to do was block everything and get rewarded. The game got so defense heavy that some legit strategies were to get a life lead and block everything until the timer was up. Honestly, it was frustrating to lose to that. I'm enjoying playing tekken 8 and not getting bored because my opponent decided to just play defense and poke me to death. Since playing, I haven't had a single match where I lost to the timer or won because of it. I'm a Raijin player and still haven't come across it.
I think it would help if a lot of hitboxes was tuned down across the board to enable skill to be a bigger factor again.

As it stands right now I have no idea when it's safe to move anywhere just going by intuition. I was hoping that T8 would try to improve on that from T7, but it seems like it's going in the opposite direction. That design also leads a lot of players to feel that the game is unfair if they can be stumped so easily by a move they just happened to forget or didn't study in detail. Ideally the move and animation should make sense so that you don't end up spending hours labbing something you rarely will be able to respond to correctly in a real match.
Hahahahha. After saying all this shit about attack and defense he will win the EVO championship or might loose from Arslan in the final and still he will say game is not according to his taste. Knee got banged by GDCR like literally insulted in Tekken Tag 2 and then also initially in Tekken 7 and then he went to Pakistan and changed his style of playing to defensive and start dominating. This is just his way of telling people that there is a chance he will not win EVO.
Humility. I like that guy.
Im not a legacy player this is my first tekken but i get it because i tend to block a lot and that really doesnt work too well in this game im finding
namco threatened him to ban him from twt if he doesnt try to publicly revert what he said? xD
https://preview.redd.it/d1s51sm2agvc1.jpeg?width=1016&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f15740172c3c4c739310ffcb7d8ec67c62e246e3
“I didn’t pay $110 to block in my FIGHTING game.” Step into the octagon and watch me flail around like a gorilla. That’s how fighting works. Right?

I’m naturally a defensive player, but casual audiences have shown time and time again: modern fighting games with less block and more punching = more players. I guess it’s more exciting that way. I prefer the “wait for an opening, then strike.” Or the whole “use your opponents momentum to topple them through their mistakes.” Which is why I gravitate to the kazama style. It’s just……. Why asuka gotta suck in the punch punch kick kick press buttons meta?
Way better attitude than saying you want to win a tournament with x character so it gets nerfed
Knee is hella valid for making this statement honestly, it made me realize I was upset at the games changes for the same reasons, considering I'd been a Tekken player since 3 I thought I should be doing better but instead realized I'd failed to adapt, seeing knees frustration made me think I shouldn't be as upset as I am at the game as a whole, I just need to relax, enjoy the game, and learn to make changes as necessary again, which is part of what I loved about the series to begin with
He shouldn’t have had to apologize for simply having an opinion.
Breaking news: Bandai Shitco has threatened Knee to ban him from all Tekken tournaments if he doesn't apologize for his negative review.
I absolutely agree with knee here, legacy players aren't rewarded for playing good defense, sidestepping is horrible and way less effective right now. If you play defense, you will realise how TIRING it is to hold block backwards and respecting your opponents frames: you get chip damaged you get forced into crouch, whatever...  I feel so burnt out trying to play good defense because there's just so much happening on your screen. The amount of offense changes from tekken 7 to tekken 8 is SO drastic and since tekken 8 has only been released for 3 so months, so you have to relearn some of the gimmicks. In tekken 7, you couldn't just mash yourself you blue ranks. In tekken 8, you can mash and see results in blue ranks. I think it will be better if you trained with a friend or training partner... getting used to the aggressive nature of tekken 8. I'm coping, but I'm definitely speaking the truth.
I personally love the chip damage addition to the game
Pros shitting on the game doesn't help it improve at all. All it does is draw negative attention to the game causing new players to avoid picking it up which means less sales which means less money for developing this game. They should be talking about what changes they would like to see and what they do like about the game. All this negative stuff gets nothing accomplished, we've become the new MK community.
    Honest feedback is good, negative or positive. And in bamco’s case, the executives argue with their own fan base about things that are universally wanted, like plug penalties.. so not instilling high levels of confidence for the future of the game. 

I’m all for positivity but not blind positivity. 

I think tekken will be fine either way, and tbh I would rather it fail because of negative feedback as opposed to fake positive feedback allowing it to succeed only to be a shitty dumbed down game. It’s a lose lose but I’d prefer the game get hated for not being good or be loved because it is good… not be loved regardless just so it keeps existing. 

I’m not even suggesting that tekken is that bad right now, I just see no value in people pretending they like it and hope it gets fixed instead of voicing their opinions before it’s too late.
        Yeah but the game was super well received. Reviews were great, this sub was booming with cool stuff until the shop showed up. That was the beginning of the end. All the good credit they earned was lost and now that's the reason the negativity is overwhelming. The game is still the same base game but it's tainted with all this other stuff now.
            No, the negativity was alive and well for a number of reasons, netcode, performance, plugging, just lots of random issues. 

Then the team doubling down on the ban list etc. 

The good faith was lost. Then as people figured out the game it became more and more obvious how oppressive offense is and how defensive expression is limited. “Why sidestep when you can block”

The game is dope, but the straws have been stacking up on the camels back, it’s not just one thing.

The mxts just put them on blast, all the other negative stuff was more of a critique of the hardcore crowds.
                Yeah but not at launch. It was well received. The issue started when plugging was rampant and they did nothing about it BUT they released a shop. The shop came out a month after launch so we had a decent run. That just solidified that they don't really care about us or the game, they just want our money. That was basically the beginning of the end.
                    The game had critiques from the get go. The general media is the only outlet that has changed the narrative. 

It’s not hard to google people talking about all these same problems the first month. We just had a lot of hope and good faith.

Now the game has been out, many flaws that are obvious have been poorly handled, and the mxt stuff just made it all look way worse. 

I agree the game was well received from a broad brush perspective, but at the core, the gameplay issues have been talked about since beta.

*I still think it’s a good ass game and I think most people do, the negativity is because it’s not what it could be*
    The old Tekken development cycle of Japanese and Koreans essentially beta-testing on arcades seems to have been better for not letting this kind of negativity spread. Now that the entire world is part of the refining process of Tekken when once they would have expected a more polished product from the start, it's really doing a number on the perception of this game.
        Big time. Steam charts show the playerbase plummeting. Expected for a fighting game since it's a niche market BUT it's trending to be less than what T7 was. That's not a good sign. Less players means they're going to up the microtransactions to compensate. It's a domino effect.
            I just responded to this in another thread, but that's not true. Both games have nearly idnetifcal three month trends, both splayerbases shrinking by the same percentage (around 35% per month). The big difference is T8 started with 40k and T7 started with around 12k.
                Interesting. I guess we need a larger sample size. Might spike after EVO if it's hype, that generally brings in new players.
    It’s funny seeing this community go through the MKX/11 cycle in real time
        Literally. We were all shitting on MK when T8 released because we were the new kings of the FGC. Then we started getting slapped around with microtransactions and pros crying that the game is unfair because they're losing too much. Been a wild 3 months.
            Crazy how it's only been three months. It's been a rollercoaster already
                Yeah, I don't think this is good for the longevity of the game. T7 overall was pretty smooth until the busted DLCs showed up but that was years after the launch.
                    It's true though that when T7 got released, it had technically already been out for a few years to become smooth.

I think a lot will depend on how the tournaments will turn out and how they are received. Can we get anything as hype as T7 tournaments in this game? Hard to say with how volatile the gameplay is. The methodical style of T7 might have its flaws but it made close games much more intense to watch because they lasted longer
                        As boring as the overly defensive gameplay was, it actually helped build a lot of tension knowing that something still had to give and the fight would begin in earnest. T8 has virtually none of that suspense and feels more like a Wild West quick-draw showdown.
                        Evo is going to be a big test for this games tournament scene. If it's well received the game will keep growing. If not we're in trouble.
            As a new player who still doesn't care too much about franchise although I REALLY do enjoy Tekken 8.

I can only imagine the cries of the players if they would deliver Tekken 9 as a fullgame. 1 balance patch and that's it. Even less skins than now. Go the MK route. And then also deliver

No mtx. No dlc's. No updates for 5 years. Pretty sure this would make ppl quit even faster lol
                T7 survived for almost ten years and the only content we got were characters. That game was great. They abandoned it towards the end to focus on T8 but it was still super active.

I don't think this game will have the same life span or sales.
                    I was a nolife gamer for the years where T7 was out and I didn't even know the game existed or had any playerbase

For the most part from what I see Tekken had around 4k active players even in 2016 XD

Yea survived is a good phrase. All I see is current community making sure T8 won't be bought by potentially interested new players for the next 4years
                        T7 was a game made with a budget of 3 happy meals and 0 marketing after a failed last game. T8 is coming in with massive marketing and budget +goodwill of the people that it built up in T7 and is looking to end up in the same or worse place than T7 was.
    Subscribing to this sub was definitely a mistake. I bought Tekken 8 out of nostalgia from playing Tekken 3 as a kid and I think the game is great. So I subscribed to this subreddit thinking that people would share tips, greats matches, and so on. But no, most of what I see here is people whining and it is affecting how I view the game.
        Yeah this sub has devolved into a mess. When the game first game out it was great, super exciting. The constant plugging and now all these trash shop items has pretty much ruined that vibe.
        You gotta just wait a little longer eventually this sub will be purified and it will be more of the tips and strategies you're looking for and a lot more Waifu fan art posts.   I expect the May patch to drop overreactions on both sides then we get back to talking about actually playing the game and not arm chair devs.
    You don't think bamco is more likely to make changes when knee makes complaints compared to when some random person on reddit does?
        No because they don't cater Tekken to pros. The money is with casuals.
            Yeah, I guess so. That's why the game has mixed reviews on steam
                People have been review bombing the game ever since the Micro transactions got announced it has nothing to do with the actual game
                    mtx is in the game though so it literally does have things to do with the game. And wtf is this review bombing shit, you think you can convince thousands of people to do what they dot want to do? if the mtx wasn't a problem people wouldn't be reviewing it badly, review bombing doesn't exist especially when you have to buy the game.
                Which sucks because I think the game is really fun just needs some tweaks and less MTXs.
                    Yeah :/ I've kind of dropped the game at this point. Maybe I'll try again after Evo japan, or one of my characters gets announced.
                        Sorry bro :(
    If they want people to talk well about the game then they should make a good game
As long as you’re being honest, you should have no reason to apologize for your opinion. Knee just happened to give his during a rough time for tekken 8 in the social space. People seem to be very on edge about the state of the game. 

In general people seem to have no concern over how the way they express themselves can affect the community they are in. You should make your honest criticisms without being so negative that you push all positivity and newcomers away
    >You should make your honest criticisms without being so negative that you push all positivity and newcomers away

Why 'should' anyone silence themselves if they genuinely feel that negative towards it?
        There's a big difference between random reddit monsters and the pro known far as wide as (probably) the best Tekken player ever. Knee has a huge following and influence. It's worth it for people with influence considering how they talk and express their opinions, given they have an outsized impact on the community.
        For the sake of allowing positivity to still exist in the community. Overwhelming negativity discouraged those that have positive things to say from saying them. Nobody is forced to care about the state of the community they are in but their impact is undeniable
            Right, but you're just repeating yourself though.

Don't be negative because it pushes away positivity.  
Why does that matter?  
Because it pushes away positivity.

What is the actual benefit to those wanting a better game? Like, sure, shut up so redditor 136794 can post their cosplay, but how is that actually doing anything worth justifying shutting down discourse?
                Only speak positive, comrade
                If the people in the community aren’t comfortable talking about what makes the game good then you can’t expect to have an honest conversation about the state of the game.
                    Then just talk about it though? Why is the presence of some people being negative bad for discussions, while you specifically wanting to disallow people from vocalizing in specific ways healthy?

Either have the discussion or don't, but you can't expect to police how people express themselves when that's exactly what's needed to gauge the state of the game's reception. Both ways.
                        Ideally people aren’t affected by other peoples opinions and so whatever ratio of positivity to negativity is how the audience actually feels. In reality whenever the initial reaction to something is extremely negative most people that would have something positive to say, will not want to do so. I’m not acting like this is something that people are willing to fix themselves, i’m just pointing out what’s happening
                            Fair enough, not trying to dismiss the validity of newcomers possibly being pushed away. However, having everyone misrepresent their own opinions to match some sort of acceptable range (so long as it's not actual bullying or spreading hate of course) is no more acceptable of a solution than telling more positive minded users to refrain from praising any element until the smoke clears.

With the key point being that positivity only rewards the current state of the game and encourages devs in what many believe to be very incorrect decisions, and just straight up manipulation in some sense, then you're artificially pushing aside negativity that needs to be heard as well. And it's that kind of behavior that causes us to end up with lower quality products, MTX, etc.

Absolutely be positive if you want, praise the elements you like, and I recommend everyone do so, but not to the point where it becomes a toxic positivity circlejerk purely because "that's better than being negative".
                Welcome to the vibes era

Meaningful discourse isnt meant for casuals, just vibes
                I think the intention was to highlight that being more specific with criticism and less doom posting might make the community and the game better. But I can read minds over the internet.
    Such an annoying way of thinking how ppl should behave, self censorship...
        Well yes we self censor ourselves all the time. Do you walk around telling everyone your opinion about things or them exactly you feel them? Probably not because you thought about what effect that would have on your relationship with them and other people. And like I stated, I am not saying you have an obligation to care about this, but that the effect is obvious.
I love this
All the old tekken players cry about t8 but still play it.. clearly this is a different game.. you gotta adapt and not play this like it’s tekken 5
As someone who last played Tekken 3 when I was a kid, this feels great to me and I'm having a blast. 

That being said, I can see how the people that have devoted so much time on the more recent games get shafted due to the drastic changes made.
 He remembered that he is selling Korean Levers and that Tekken Players are the most buying customers. So this statement is just for in order not to lose your marketing potential.
If people hate Tekken 8 so bad, why haven't they gone back to 7? Payday 3 flopped so everyone is back on payday 2. Tekken 7 on the other hand is dead.
    Because T7 has a lot of technical issues largely ironed out in 8, like the horribly long and extremely frequent loading screens. Not to mention, T8 has proper(ish?) rollback netcode and largely (sorry, Steve) better visuals.

Trust me, if Bamco were to release a Tekken 5DR remake with modern online and QoL, both 7 and 8 would be in coffins the next day, with the hypothetical 9 joining them on release assuming it adopts recent design philosophies.
        Damn. I've never even played Tekken 5. I haven't jumped on 8 yet due to all the drama. Will continue to wait a bit.
Tekken 8's biggest sin is that dog shit excuse of a battle pass. The fuck is that trash.

Also, Removing mods by dmcing people instead of, yah know, getting an anti cheat to protect against scripters and mods. No, that would be stupid, right?
I think this move towards leaving fighting games mostly unpatched until the first major tournament is a massive mistake. You're pissing off 99.99% of the playerbase and to be honest a lot of the competitive players as well. I'm not expecting a comprehensive heat rework or anything right off the bat but I think the poor character balancing is probably a major contributor to the frustration many are feeling with the game, both casual and competitive alike. It's just one of many things squandering the goodwill they had.
I’m personally in the camp of “this is my first real Tekken so I like everything.” Just me?
"I'm not going to ask to change it to be good for pro's" 💀 Game needs some tweaks but intrinsically it feels fine?
Listen I’m not saying Twitter can’t get crazy but you guys are acting like police were outside Knees house waiting to arrest him for his opinion. No one forced him to make a follow up tweet.People take social media too seriously
Sad that we've demonized criticism so hard that if you have a platform and use it to say you're not having fun, that you should be made to feel like you have to apologize for it.
to be honest, I think saying that it’s not pro friendly due to being aggression focused is completely wrong from the jump, it’ll just breed a different kind of pro that is used to more aggressive play.
I am so glad he came out and said this. When i saw his first tweet I was fully expecting the fanbase to explode and keep shouting "KNEE HATES TEKKEN, TEKKEN 8 IS SHIT". Great to see pros acknowledge that it's not the end of development and can be improved
Game's just bad.
dogshit players coercing top players to express their opinion in a cordial manner, game is an aggressive 50/50 guessing game now and thats a fact. All these people whining " adapt" have the iq of a fucking goldfish.
why is he backing down, the fundamental systems in t8 need changes and its good he raise his voice
Nah honestly the negativity is truly killing the game. It’s not that bad. Stop pretending watching t7 tournaments was fun. Poke KBD was literally it. Now people who do enjoy the game aren’t going to because there’s no sense of accomplishment when everyone disregards you because “you’re good at a scrub game”. And nobody realizes not supporting your favorite franchise rn WILL KILL IT. When 2xKO comes out if there’s no middle ground met between devs and players, it will die. If y’all think that game ain’t gonna shake shit up I got a bridge in Baltimore to sell you(I’m from Baltimore before you get upset about that too)
    Tell hell do you mean lol have you seen the crowd watching tekken 7 tournaments? Was fun as hell and we had incredible moments, just go to YouTube and watch, I can even send to you if you want
        I’ve seen them. Uh duh the crowd that’s there is gonna be hype they’re there supporting there favorites.  I also remember nothing but Leroy’s and everyone crying into metaphorical megaphones about that too.
        Nah that's bs. At the start yes, people were hype about the slowmos etc. But the game had several bs patches like when literally everyone was playing leroy and I also remember CONSTANT crying about how 2ds ruin the game. And thousands of sleepyfaces in twitch chat when it was just players backdashing on infinite stages. 

The offline crowd at events is always going to be hype. They are right there. Ofc theyll cheer. Wont be any different for T8 although the crowd will be bigger.
    The negative Nancy’s are annoying, but they won’t kill the game.  And 2XKO will get shitted on by picky fans as well, that’s just the nature of the FGC
        It will but it’s riot. Riot while money hungry, knows how to keep a game competitive and fun enough to retain massive amounts of players just because it’s riot.
    yea people mashing rage art way more enjoyable.
        Do we really need to cover this again? Rage art is borderline useless if you’re fighting someone not garbage. In combos it’s scaled heavily. And not in combos easily readable and avoidable. Rage art is at the very bottom of issues with the game. T7 also had that so…you’re just saying shit. And you can’t “spam” a move you get one time per round lmao. Warrior opinion.
            idky y’all be acting like top player’s don’t use rage art. rage art + heat smash is cancer.
                It’s really not and you’re not even on topic anymore. It was in t7. Heat smash is harder to deal with sure. Still not game breaking. Oh no you get 50/50d just like in every other tekken game or fighting game 🥴🥴🥴
                    well in my opinion it is. heat smash + rage art + power crush heat engagers are cancer. idc what u talkin bout. ur obviously some loser ass nigga who thinks his opinion matters cuz he slightly decent at tekken.
                        Lmao you’re such a pussy and that’s evident. Why would anyone care about what someone who is just a whiner and garbage have to say anyway? Your opinion is just stupid. You can’t even speak  your some broke ass uneducated actual loser in everything you do, don’t be mad at me for it
                            bruh stop all that yappin lol u claim ur life better than mine so lets prove it. all i said was u being good at tekken was irrelevant to life and you starting goin off on a tangent. must be insecure about some things lol.
                                Nah you came up in here on my shit first. If you could read, you’d have noticed I said FROM and then elaborated that I’m from, not IN, meaning I live somewhere else, Baltimore. I see the education quality hasn’t changed there at all. Sad. You’re just another wanna be dime a dozen tough dude when you start realizing you’re saying stupid shit “come and see irl” LMAO anybody saying that shit isn’t scary, can’t fight, and ain’t shit. You’re the insecure one and that’s exactly why you resort to such a stupid thing to say.
                                    But super congrats on being the dumbest fuck I’ve ever seen in this sub. Don’t get shot in Baltimore trying to be what you ain’t 🤷‍♀️
                                    bro i said stop all that yappin either prove u on sum or just shut ur monkey mouth. I’m not from baltimore #1 and if you can’t understand what i’m saying that shows how ignorant you are, not me. so once again, stop yappin, you said your life better than mine lets prove it. We in the same area 🤔
            There are legit criticisms but “wahhh wage art” isn’t one of them.
                that’s your opinion. acting like your some top player and you can dictate what people have issue with doesn’t help anything 🤣
                    Im not dictating what you have an issue with I’m saying it’s not a legitimate issue. You’re just a scrub.
                        bro idc what u think i am, u being good at tekken means absolutely nothing in life lol.
                            Ah my point. We’re talking about tekken tho so…”hehe you’re good at game but not life” typical last resort when you’re losing an argument. Time to log off scrub. My life is still better than yours too so 🤷‍♀️
                                idc about your point lol you called me a scrub, so im telling you. you being good at a video is irrelevant to the grand scheme of life. 😂 and if u from baltimore we can link up and see who life really better 🤔
                                    From and living in are different things buddy. You ain’t scary pussy
Honestly though why do people care about other peoples opinions on the game?

An individual critique or balance suggestion, I understand

But it’s almost like we’re all desperate to have a big name in our camp and like… it’s such a weird thing to care about to me
Bamco probably called him a scrupman after reading his initial tweet 😬
As a new player, idk when the fuck its my turn after blocking 😭

on the other hand, idk what the fuck I did right when I apply continuous pressure. Is it my doing or the fault of my opponents for getting hit?
Damage control and backtracking.
IMO, combo’s giving recoverable health is really stupid. I can understand chip damage being recoverable, but combo damage? It just makes a round much longer than it has to be and has actually tripped me up a few times.
Legacy knowledge? Bro forgot about the chip damage as default in the PS1 era Tekkens and it shows.
They did the same to Armored Core and now I'm suffering on both games. Braindeath and random chance is priority over genuine skill and techniques.
I'm very impressed with how much English he's developed in kinda short time. Was able to get his thoughts out on a topic that's kinda touchy within the player base rn in a very well structured way; tiny gramma mistakes aside. Also, it's not like I'm his English teacher or anything, but it's just a huge positive to the community that an OG can communicate with the community at large without needing to go through a bad translation layer. 

Returning to the "T8 is boring" thing, it is just what OG players need to adapt to I think. With T8 trying to be more open to attacking so it's easier for new fans to pick up it'll be frustrating for OG players that were held up high for their abilities to block, and defend both by reading the game, and using mechanics like a well timed SS giving good regards. Sure, there are some weird af decision Bamco made to make this possible, but the hopes are the game getting better balanced for both side of the coin; although my current expectation is low on that.
    cuz this is from his team, not himself idiot. LMAO :D
i think its fun tho 🤷‍♂️lol
Learn English amirite
T8 is the best game ever made,T7 is for old people
There is a reason pros retire from esports when they are at late 20s
Tekken needs new players, not sit in a stone age suiting only pro play.
    Most of new players are gonna quit as soon as people block their mash and they get mashed I instead
boo hoo I can't adapt to the new game so I suck at it game's trash(((((((
    People just want the parts of the tekken identity that were removed to come back
    HMU when you win a FT10 against Knee
    When someone says he can't adapt when he is in god of destruction rank, we call it humility
Namco's solution was very easy.



>Kill game tracking

>Buff the sidestep

>Kill KBD



Killing KBD will prevent players from playing Tower Defense and would make rushing more intuitive, nothing more annoying than the guy doing KBD and already being on the other side of the screen... What's the logic? If it weren't for the idiot on the knee playing like this, Tekken 8 wouldn't be like this, but no, the idiot needs to stay behind, playing Plants vs Zombies.
    Kbd is the coolest part of tekken. It's what got me into the game.
        Yes, the coolest part that turn tekken 7 into Tower Defense.

Kill it and the game become better, no more walling game.
            You used backdash to create whiffs... that's the whole point
                KBD is an exploit, it is not a mechanic, the reason they made backdash nerfed is literally because they aren't meant to be like that
                Backdash is a thing

korean backdash is another thing

Whats the matter to play a FIGHT GAME that players go running back back back?

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFTBLQZ-Cis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFTBLQZ-Cis)

Killing it make much better to game system.
            Does get good apply here? It’s all just movement bru.
    I actually think there being no infinite stage makes up for KBD quite a lot. Still annoying but at least there’s a limit. Eventually they will have their back to the wall
    They killed movement in T6.0 and the game felt stiff and horrible. Killing movement will ruin the game.
    Good Lord what a bad take.

Tekken IS MOVEMENT and kbd is a part of it. Even if you remove kbd completely people will still cancel backdash with sidestep. So what now, gonna kill backdash into sidestep too? Whats next, remove fuzzy guard?
this is NOT the animearc I wanted for knee :(
    Old man Knee arc!
Old man, acknowledge he's an OLD MAN, humble mofo over there, a true legend and amazing player ❤️
“Git gud”😏
That’s what happens. When they drop a new game they. Hangs the meta around. Happens to FPS games all the time. T8 is not like T7, shocking I know! I prefer it since it levels the playing field for new players. Can’t have fun if you get consistently pissed on in Online bc some dude has learned the meta 20 years ago and it hasn’t changed.
The self-awareness and humility to acknowledge that he might be frustrated because he's getting old and his legacy skills don't port well to the new game is great.

There's a lifetime of habit to adapt to and overcome in order for him to find his "flow" in T8. Those old habits aren't serving him well right now, and newer players less "burdened" with ingrained legacy playstyles/habits may be able to adapt more quickly to what T8 *is*, rather than trying to play what Tekken *was*.
    You don't get that good at a game by thinking you know everything, gotta have the humility to keep learning.
    This is what I had to learn and accept when SFIV came out.  I was so used to the old way of Capcom fighters, that I just couldn’t adapt to the new style.

I’ve gotten better with them as time has gone on, but I’m nowhere near as good as I was then.  Of course, age has gone way up and playtime has gone way down, so that’s as much of it as anything else.
    The self-awareness and humility of the glazing on this post 🤣🤣
    He's saying the right thing. But I think he knows deep down T8 will never be as fun as the old Tekkens.


I know it's hard to accept, so people drink that copium.


The game sucks tho. It's that simple lol.


People like Knee can "try" to like it all they want, but you shouldn't have to try so hard to enjoy a video game. 


I think that's the main thing. He said he wasn't having fun and this is a common sentiment. The game just isn't as fun with the new direction. Rushdown gets old fast if there's no variety. When rushdown was just 1 style it was great. Variety is the spice of life.
Hes probably being diplomatic. He's probably not gonna sugarcoat it when he's talking with his friends in person.
    he definitely shouldn't need to say sorry for not enjoying the game
    Yup, no one with half a brain and a reputation to uphold will post their real thoughts on X.
It’s interesting that both him and arsal and ash (or whatever his name is. Lol) has the same sentiment in such a short time. He similarly posted apologies for complaining and vowed to adapt. 

Curious if the Sajam video about it having a bad effect on the community favored in at all?
    Bro said arsal and ash
        Arsal and Ash, attorneys at law.  Have you been injured while playing video games?  Arsal and Ash can make sure you get the settlement you're entitled to, call us today!

                I'm misspelling some words on purpose. At first its cause I was lazy and did not know how to spell "probably" right and always spelled probly, but now I'm doing it on purpose cause chat bots and ai don't do stuff like that and I think it's just more fun, although I still use proper grammer for essays and stuff
                    You did that last one on purpose, didn’t you?
        Arsenal. Oscar Kazama. Hello amigos.
        I could have googled but was too lazy.  Lol :)
    All I can think when about when I see this Tekken stuff is that Sajam segment he did like a week ago. 

He put into words what ive been thinking about video games discourse online in general for the longest time.
    I doubt either one of them cares what sajam had to say about a Tekken game
    Lol, arsal !!, he won evo 4 times, you should at least know his name if you watch tekken tournaments.
        I am super ADHD, so details like this often escape me.  I have a vague enough idea of their name to recognize it if I see it, but not enough to spell it.
    Thats because him and arsenal are both getting clobbered at locals. They kinda always tweet right after getting smashed, which makes for more heated takes. So in comparison this is knee being calmed down and more self-aware.
        True. Arsenal had a very rough couple of days, but im not sure if knee would fare better against Bayern. Tho his defensive style may be difficult to crack.
    Well i know Arslan has been in the US getting washed up by the players here… feels like thats why he changed his mind
Nah he me need to stand on business because he wasn’t wrong in the first place
I am seeing "based" on reddit but I don't get it, what does it mean when someone is "based"?
    Usually it's just a way of saying "this person is spittin facts"
        Ok now I know the meaning, but from where this comes from, based? Like based on something?
            [https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/based](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/based)
                I’m glad Lil B gets his flowers on this because he literally came up with the slang and now people don’t even realize how strongly it’s associated with him
                    Lil B had waaay more influence than people will ever give him credit for lol
                        ya ill contribute to this tangent. i love that man. real ones know
                    Yeah man he's from Berkeley/Oakland. I remember my friend Natasha now known as Kreayshawn used to shoot videos for Lil B. She began a music career when she saw how easy it was to do music videos and go viral
            Idk the origin really and as far as i know it's not really used in a "based on this.." way. It's actually kind of a running meme that ppl reply "based on what?" When they don't understand how or why the word is being used that way. Sorry if this explanation is lacking.
                Nah you're good, thank you.
            based on your mom lmao gottem
            Literally just means that the person is standing on a strong ideological base and that they aren't likely to be pushed off of it because it is strong. Overwhelmingly used as a compliment, although it is possible to be based on a flawed foundation.
    Internet edgelords took it from lil b
    It means they're based in Reddit: they live here.
Yup because the damn brainless twitter user will crucify him for his opinion.
    Yeah that's what makes it so sad. Here you have a man who devoted large chunks of his live to Tekken and build a career of it just for an army of red ranks go "Loly git gud scrub." 

This is so undignified.
        It also goes the other way I doubt he wants people to use his opinion to validate shitting on the game because they're hardstuck red.

Which is what a lot of people are doing, a lot of complaints pros make are specific to that level of tekken and for them it's also their job.

I literally saw someone saying nothing should be faster than a 10f jab that breaks the rules of tekken then they complain that flash is a 9 frame start up that robs their turn.
As if yoshis flash hasn't been around since tekken 3

I'm all for criticising the game but it's just a tiring seeing people rush to shit on it as it is to defend it
If it had to be there at all, it should have been exclusive to heat.
    That's what I thought it was when the heat system and chip was announced. But then the day I got the game I was like "where tf did 20% of my health go???".
        \*record scratches\*

Wait, why do I remember hearing/reading you wouldn't get chip unless it was heat? Did I just lose to translation? Chip damage happens outside of heat? 

If this just grey health system? 

Ooof, maybe 1 too many systems in place.
            You take chip damage "grey health" when you block attacks. You regen grey health when you attack whether its blocked or it hits. Engaging heat heals all your grey health. You lose when all your red health is gone, though you can't be chipped to death.

When tekken 8 was announced and the new systems talked about. I thought chip only happened while in heat. But thats not true. Which seems weird.
            Not all moves add chip damage.  But those that do give chip damage in heat or not.  (Damage goes up in heat though)
    This would've been fine

Like how in SF6, they made it so chip only happens when you're in burnout state
        I really like the drive gauge in sf6. It’s powerful but if you go too ham burnout can be really punishing.
    I agree. As much as I enjoy Tekken 8, I do think chip damage should just happen after you activate heat mode. It kind of makes no sense to have chip damage happen under any other circumstance really. I noticed chip damage happen when I played a few days ago when neither of us were in Heat and thought that was weird. I get that the direction is all about offense and I do broadly support that, but you shouldn't be punished for blocking something successfully in this way.
        Some moves have innate chip properties like Asuka's ff1+2 and running 1+2 for example. As for the heat chip damage debate i am all for it since you gain back that health by attacking. It is a mechanic  meant to punish turtiling up which alot of intermediate and beginner players often do. Now i will agree that the amount of chip damage should be lowered a bit as well as overall damage in some areas.
            I mean...are you sure that beginner and intermediate players are the ones who do the turtling? I would much rather say that advanced and pro players tend to turtle way more and beginners and intermediates tend to learn strings and flowcharts and spam them all the time.
                Its about 50/50 in my experience. Its not that beginners are blocking everything it just that i noticed that some tend to slowly back walk away instead of trying to attack. As in i would do a clearly unsafe option and they just back walk and avoid interaction. I dont know how beginner Jins ive played that just back walk and the moment i go for an interaction demon paw or Bryan u4. Now it could just be my luck or region but about 85% of my online matches are overly defensive players both beginner and intermediate, 5% intermediate/advanced spammers, and the rest are a mixed grab bag of players who kinda what they are doing.
                    I have a totally different experience, honestly. Beginners are overly aggressive and tend to mash even when they're heavily under frames or they throw the most unsafe but flashy move. Intermediates tend to keep the distance and approach with safe moves like Jin's ff2 because it is actually a more "thought through" way to play the game. Advanced and pro players usually pick you apart with movement usually using only ultra-safe strings and pokes.
    It's a problem, even in heat, imo. I don't understand, why Reina (3+4, 4, 4) or Victor (expulsion) can just press a "free damage" button and chip me for like 20 damage with barely any ways to counterplay them safely and reliably.
        at least chip cant kill you. i know the situation you're talking about, though. 

In MK11 you could get heroic chip out, which is just a fancy way of saying you died to a safe block strong with 0 counter play.
        I mean Victor's Explosion is -17 on block or something like that, so even if you take chip damage you can get that health right back simply by punishing that same Explosion which is an unsafe move.
            not in heat it's not, it's safe during heat
    Yes. Just yes.
    I kinda get why it works outside of heat to counteract health regain, but I think they should nerf chip till its the same or slightly worse than health regain cause that would incentives attacking without making blocking bad
    Or rage or something.  Also why is totally normal damage recoverable what are the rules what is happening
        Juggles and OTGs leave recoverable health. Its really not that complicated lol
            Idk if I can give you "it's not that complicated"
    Heat is where you heal chip damage.
Chip damage itself isnt bad. Its the huge ammount of chip damage that some moves have. Like victors explosion in heat. Chip damage should only deal 1 to 5 points in my opinion
    Honestly, the amount of chip damge should be scaled by howsafe or unsafe the move is on block. The safer it is the less chip damage it would do.

So, something like Drags running 2 would do extremely low chip damage, while Claudios wr2 should do a bit more than that simply because it can be ducked.
    I think the chip damage would be fine if combo damage was scaled back and everythingelsewasbalanced. Even though he is hard to win with, Leroy, for example,  feels fair. Low single hit damage, fast hitting chip from chain punches, better than average combo damage. Zafina feels off however, with mid single hit damage, trash combo damage, and her best chip moves damaging her.
It'd make sense for moves that have an obvious or easy counterplay (unless opponent's in a corner for example), have long startup or are otherwise difficult to hit often. Instead they gave chip damage to super oppressive wr move, which with little practice you can spam up close and opponent's counterplay is 2-step at least with tight timing. It's like giving kazuya a 12f knd 50/50. Minimum downsides, maximum reward. And to think they haven't adjusted it since launch is even more bs, while some companies can basically change balance in their hands every week or so.
I agree with this, but it's also not even in my top 5 complaints for this game which should tell you how much I dislike the gameplay.
    I'm in the same boat that there are other things that bother me more than chip. As a Claudio player though my strings are like 2/3 hit max. Reina/Hwaorang/Law etc they get like 6 hits in a row with safe strings. Interesting. 

anyways what are you biggest complaints? just curious.
    Scrub
        What rank are you hon?
            I'll go ahead and post the anonymous tekken player bitching flow chart

1\. "I'm GoD"

"No you're not you're lying"

2\. "I'm TGS"

"Wow not even GoD? I am, don't talk to me"

3\. "Any other rank"

"I'm (your rank+3), scrub"

regardless you're a scrub with a bitchmade mentality
                Thank you for the meltdown, we all enjoy a good laugh 😂😂
                    That was a pretty wild ride, wasn't it? Lol. 

  
I hope he doesn't delete the comment chain, that was a hell of a train wreck.
                    Stay scrubby
                        Stay obese and miserable
                            project harder
                                Why do you talk like an incel?
I really liked how guilty gear ac went about making the game more offensive focused.  There was chip damage, but it was very very minimal.  In addition, there was meter that went up every time you blocked and went down every time you hit or got hit.  If the meter got too high, you would take way more damage on the next hit.

They balanced this (and the crazy blockstrings you could pull off in that game) with defensive options which cost meter like the dead angle attack, flawless defence, and slashback.
To add to that why are there still characters who rely heavily on defense and punishing? What place does a character like Asuka have in the game for example when her entire gameplay has been based around being a turtle and punishing whiffs?
chip damage makes sense in certain fighting games, as a way to discourage overly defensive and safe playstyles.

i'm a complete noob to tekken, but it feels like this game doesn't need it at all. playing too defensively seems like it would only be a losing strategy in this game

i guess the idea is that you are rewarded more for crouching/sidestepping/parrying attacks...but it still feels unnecessary. if it was only from heat then it would be different
    Nah. It's all about the launch punish, flash ducking, sidestep punish this time around. They only beefed up Parry for Azucena. Everyone else has to low parry or use their toned down version of a standing parry. 

But I can say that Paul's parries are still pretty much intact from T7. I have a friend who mains him.
    Well I'm no Tekken pro but I've seen enough pros playing in T7 tournaments to say that defense actually was the best strategy. Because block and whiff punishment and counter hits were (and still are) some of the most powerful tools a character and a player have. To know what you can punish and how is the greatest strength you can build as a player. 
To charge brainlessly with unsafe flow charts into a player who actually knows what he's doing is a death sentence.
I don't mind chip damage at all. I just really want the heat engagers gone.
    That's not going to happen but they should probably adjust the frame advantage after. +17 is pretty crazy.
        Can you explain to me the frames on heat engagers? +17 should mean that i have a 17 frame move guaranteed after no? But its not like that right? Nothing is guaranteed after i do a heat engager?
            The opponent is in a forced block for 17 frames. They can't do anything but block.
            Like people have said, the opponent can still block and duck during those 17 frames. This kind of frame advantage is sometimes labeled as +17g where g I think stands for "guard" and many situations in the game have this, like Kazuya's df1,4 being +17g or something on hit and his db4 doing similar on counter hit, as opposed to Jin's 4 being a true +13 on ch and granting him guaranteed followups
            sometimes things that are +10 or more will still allow the opponent to block, it just depends on the moves. Heat Engagers always allow the opponent to block. You are right in your assumption that +17 should mean a 17 frame or faster move would hit, but tekken is complicated so it doesn't work that way in some instances.
            For most characters, their fastest move is 10f.

Being +17 means they cannot do anything else than block for the first 17 frames you can move. That means any move that's 26 frames or less (which is very slow) is uninterruptable.
            It means you can act 17 frames before your opponent can. It doesn't mean they can't block.
    I'm with you.... I don't mind chip damange.... the heat system should be adjusted though. The game is just so much more fun without it. Feels so good to put a heat engager in their place w out using them myself.
 it would he great if heat was a double edged sword, you recieve more chip but you also deal chip damage which lets people find openings on someone with heat and punish it
The thing with chip damage in games is because usually there isn't really scary mix to begin with. Look at Street Fighter V or any Mortal Kombat game besides X.Tekken has many way to get opened up and launched
chip damage is new donald trump
sidestep, dodge or jump over. git gud
    Or do 3 all at once against Azucena, easy just get better l0l
        eeeezzzz
I don't mind some chip damage, but it'd be better if it was relegated to very specific moves or pokes.
    It is…
        Yeah I want it reduced even further
To encourage you to do something other than blocking
not many moves do chip damage except heat and most I feel are negative on block .
Without chip damage, Tekken 8 will just be a rehash of the defensive meta of Tekken 7.
Chip is good because being able to just be a turtle is boring. You get temporarily punished with chip, but you get rewarded with health back by knowing when to go in and counter, or you just flush and lose it all if your offensive skills aren’t as good as your defensive skills. 

It’s a balancing act and a fighting game. If you’re a god at blocking and breaking throws, you shouldn’t be able to win by just getting one to two hits in and running the timer down.
    Except everything is +on block or safe so by the time it's your turn you already guessed wrong in one of 5000 50/50 situations and you've lost all that gray health. Then you try sidestepping and you get hit by a homing throw. Game is doodoo right now.
        its funny cause its mostly the safe and plus moves that chip
        You know why is the throw game so *weird*?? Like I get all the changes but they're incoherent.

I think making 1+2 break throws homing and all other throws *not homing* would be a cool move idk
        When a top tier like Drag or Jun puts you into the grinder at the wall, and even if you guess their mixups right on block (you can punish almost nothing cause everything is +), but they dont mind cause they chipping away my hp quite fast. The game literally makes you spam and discourage any calculated defensive play.
        Everything is + on block or safe? Lol, lmao even.
        I mean let's play through this scenario. Your opponent uses + moves on you several times in a row and at no point are you interrupting him, he has conditioned you. Then you guess a 50/50 wrong, whatever that's supposed to be (does not remove your grey health usually). Then you fail to break a throw that your opponent threw out because he predicted you would sidestep or further turtle up. Is your opponent not supposed to win that round?
    If I'm a god at playing good defensive Tekken, I shouldn't be punished by the game for playing against someone who can't break turtles. I'm fine with the game overall having less CHs in general to sit on, to allow for more active engagements this time around, but offense is just way too oppressive and unnecessarily punishing right now, towards opponents who like to take their turns blocking for just about any reason. 

There needs to be a balance. Bamco needs to reward both styles of play.
        If you were a god at playing defensive Tekken, you should be able to sidestep/duck/low parry/interrupted at some point. Holding back and backdashing isn't good defensive Tekken. The issue is that there's some absurd moves in the game right now that track too well or are too plus where you don't have good options other than block. It's okay to be punished for blocking and rewarded for avoid attacks.
            This would be true if this game wouldnt be a 50/50 spam fest. You can learn strings and stuff but it all goes out of the window if you just have to guess.
            >implying the gods of defensive Tekken have been able to consistently sidestep/duck/low parry/interrupt things when it matters most to win them games. Except it doesn't.

Seems like you're missing the whole point. Strong defensive Tekken is not as well rewarded as it should be. Playing well in Tekken 8 is constantly attacking to run your game and making sure the other player isn't allowed to attack, or play the game. Blocking is important for other things aside from just deciding to turtle up and bait CHs.

"the issue is that there's some absurd moves in the game right now that track too well or are too plus where you don't have good options other than block"

So you agree with me. Offense is too oppressive and too punishing towards defensive players. You're being punished for blocking not because of chip damage, but because you're forced to constantly take mixups and are put into disadvantageous situations where you're just blocking. Not turtling, not trying to run out the clock. Just. Blocking.

That's the problem.
    One of the posts in here that I saw said that chip damage is okay as long as it mostly happens in Heat Mode and not normal play, and I agree. That's where I stand on the issue mostly.
if you were blocking punches in real life, would you be able to block them forever without taking any damage? You can’t just infinitely block everything
    If it was real life, Kuma's 1 jab would decapitate you.
        I don’t know if you understand, but what makes real world fights engaging to watch (mma) is seeing you wither down a defending opponent, obviously not everything is going to be realistic, but the idea that you can’t just put your guard up forever is what creates engagement, that’s why when people watch muay thai, or boxing, they’re interested in how much damage someone incurred through leg kick checks or blocking punches. I think chip is necessary, but dodges should be more powerful.
            I actually really enjoy combat sports (mostly MMA but also some boxing), so I appreciate what you're saying, in that there's a rich combination of factors that make analyzing a fight enjoyable.

What I would offer you is that a fighter breaking down their opponent's defense is usually achieved by how effectively they can bypass the opponent's guard - going for the body, kicking the legs. You usually have to hit your opponent somewhere other than his guard in order to make your exertion worth it. In Tekken this is simulated by fast pokes that are easy to land but do just a little damage.

In real life, I would argue that a person who is effectively able to check every one of his opponent's attacks will have the advantage, all else being equal. If I check three hard low kicks I expect your leg is going to hurt more than mine, but I wouldn't want my opponent in game to take (gray health) damage just by me blocking their lows - it's more interesting and skillful that I have to select and apply an appropriate punish rather than damage just being awarded.
Sadly in modern world the word of influencers matters a lot. For competetive games the influencers are the top gamers.
    It’s a damn shame, you hate to sound like an old man yelling at a cloud but this shit really didn’t start until the social media generation, not to this level
Come on, let's not kid ourselves.  What's going to happen to a competitive game trying to get traction if you look it up and all you see is the top players saying it sucks ass?
    You take their opinion in mind but form your own? Like you should with any opinionated thing in life? The game very well might not be appealing to legacy competitive Tekken players, why should that affect your decision to try it out the competitive aspect of Tekken? You might like what they don’t like about it. 

I wouldn’t had played or experienced half the things in life that I enjoy a lot of if I listened to people who said it wasn’t good or fun. It’s absolutely ridiculous that people let others dictate their thoughts and opinions so much these days. 

It’s okay to like what everyone doesn’t and it’s okay to not like what everyone does.
        That's fine for people already playing the game.  The point is more that nobody new is going to try it if all they hear from the recognized figures in the game's community is "this game sucks!"  Your time is limited and most people are going to try things because they heard other people like them, not because they heard people say they suck
            How many casuals even know about Knee and Arslan? I mean T7 sold like 10M~11M copies. Like the most viewed T7 vid is the Arslan vs Knee at 2.2M views after 4 years even if we assume twice as many people will see their tweets that would still be less than half all the people who ever played T7 knowing about them.
        there is an infinate number of things to do in your free time. i could practace tekken 8 or i could detail my car. if the people why play it the most say its bad why would i even waste my time?
    If you ignore the flaws of something because you're afraid of it failing, they have no incentive to fix the flaws.

Namco knows what'd happen. If they deserve to be in their position, they'd make changes to stop it happening.
    Tekken isn’t trying to get traction. It already has traction. It is widely considered the most complicated and competitive fighting game.
        T8 is like...lightyears far from a competitive game.
            That’s complete bs and you know nothing about competitive games then.
                Haha sure:), when movement doesnt work, when throws are tracking and unbreakable on ch, when you skip neutral with so many brainless easy tools, when you force 5050 with no risk etc. Youre living in the past where tekken WAS kinda competitive, youre like those who atill calling Shaheen a honest character, its T8 baby, the game where option select is part of the past.
                    Just because Tekken 8 is more aggressive doesn’t mean it’s not competitive. And 50/50s always have a degree of risk because if you block the low you are almost always getting combo’s for 70+. You can reduce the amount of 50/50s with good movement. If you do 20 dmg to your opponent and they haven’t done any you can just stand back and force them to come to you. Movement doesn’t work? More like you don’t know how to move. Movement literally got buffed from T7. Homing throws are a bit annoying but you can also just duck. Tekken has always been a mixup oriented game. Most characters aren’t that brainless except for about 5 characters. The game has also been out for only 3 months. T7 had 2 years of balance tweaks before it arrived to console. If any changes need to seriously be made, we’ll see them after Japan EVO once the devs can see what current behavior is busted in competitive play. Especially if they see half the cast play Azu.
                        Yeah , i dont know how to move  yet eddy powercrush hit me on his back, and I blocked drag's wr2 when I was litteraly on his back , got hit by Ninas F1+2 when I was on her back and endless similar situations, movement is litteraly trash, and even more trash due to hitboxes being buffed ( the problem is the new hitboxes and not the movement probably). Also some 50/50 are 0 to none risk especially on heat. This game wants you to just throw bs overtuned moves like reinas 3+4,4,4 or victors u1+2 , those with other dozens of braindead "just throw" and hope for the best. Game is currently objectively shit on the competitive scense. Also heatsmashes , the vest just throw and hope for the best, has weird evasiveness and tracking, ghost range, free 5050 on block for snowball, if you manage to step some of them, gl punishing it due to forward momentum, way way too much reward for 0 risk. This game is a joke currently. Its fun though at least not against the top 8 characters.

P.s - dont forget that mr.Murray once said "why would you move when you can just block anf punish" this became real in this game with its casino unescapable 50/50 and random tracking of neutral killing moves like mishimas demon paws, dvj uf1 , lilis df3+4 etc... just random full screen tracking.
                            Must powercrushes are steppable. Drag’s WR2 is steppable. Reina’s 3+4,4,4 is annoying but is punishable with a 12f or can get rekt by a well timed mid. Expulsion is literally launch punishable, it just forces crouch so it’s got to be a WS combo. Some of the tracking in the game is a bit rough. Demon Paw is a good example. And aside from characters like Azu and Drag there is a fair amount of counterplay. People love to toss around the term casino but anyone with a strong kbd can force a fair amount of whiffs, or an armor can interrupt some 50/50s.
                                Powercrushes are steppable, but everything randomly tacking in this game. Wr2 is steppable too  but why did I block it when I was 180° to the actual diraction?3+4,4,4 -8 on blick and explusion -4 in heat(imo the dumbest buffed move rn, you litteraly have to block it cuz its tracking and full screen) basivclly punishing you for blocking, or even worse, eating a full combo damage from 1 move thats safe.  With all the randomness rng based bs that occures in this game its shit, also when you manage to sidestep a certain move or string the whiff punish may whiff for no reason , there are some consistant interactions, also random camera changes makes a df2 punish into db2 for example, this game is so far from being solid enough to start talking about competitive gameplay.
        7 was 8 not so much
Have fun „adapting“ to 50/50 mixups. Wonderful
    Have fun having the balance of a game live rent free in your head. Try doing something else for a bit. It’s better for your health. Or just keep banging your head on your keyboard. Whatever.
        "Hey I like this franchise but don't like how they skewed it towards 50/50 mixups i hope they change it" GAMES RENT FREE IN UR HEAD LOSER GO TOUCH GRASS LOL. 

Just because someone has a different opinion to you doesn't mean they are raging and it consumes them lol
More like a cheque
    Yup, the more I think about it. This is likely to happen.  
You can never have too much money playing tekken as a career.
Are you really so scared of lawyers that you think they are capable of legal action against someone sharing an opinion? Like, how much power do you think they have?
    did lawyers tell you to write this?
        I think they're a lawyer themselves. Sounds awful lot like something that a lawyer, that doesn't want the common folk to know the extent of their power, would say.
        Did you write this because you were scared of a lawyer?
            The lawyers are on to us we gotta koreanbackdash out of here
                Oh no dude, you put me on p2 side!

    They are capable of threatening someone who shared an opinion, and unless you can fight back, and spend time on it, its almost always better to retract. They know, they won't win in court, they don't need to take it to court.

Of course, I don't think Bamco's lawyers are involved here lol.
        They have nothing to threaten Knee with here...
            They're lawyers, they 100% know some yakuza dudes. Knee is probably held hostage and the bandai namco yakuza department wrote that tweet.
                You know what, I 100% believe you
            I'm not denying that, but don't tell me you've never come across a lawyer threatening a meaningless lawsuit around flimsy logic. My company had received a summons for piracy when they had zero proof we used their product. We were one of the few that could fight back, so we challenged them and put them in their place. But a lot of others settled because they had threatened a lot and asked for so less. 

Also, we were one of the few that didn't actually use their industry standard software.
                And you think it's a likely scenario that Bamco lawyers are going after Knee because he is a struggling member of the lower class who can't fight back?
                    Bruh, Just saying lawyers can and will make issue if they are asked to do so. You want proof ? Just check out John Oliver's case. And no, Knee is not bigger than John Oliver. 

A random ass libel suite. One year later the case was dismissed. But guess what, his insurance went up, and damage was done. AND THIS WAS FOR A SEGMENT ON SLAPP LAWSUITS.

I'm not implying that there were any lawyers involved in this Knee statement lol. Bamco aren't stupid, nor do they have any reason to do so. However, if, and again, IF they did want to, you can bet that they can cause more than enough trouble for said person to retract their statements. Especially because said persons livelihood depends on being associated with their game.
                        And you think the John Oliver case, where he is talking about SLAPP lawsuits, is comparable to this situation where Knee is saying he doesn't like the Tekken metagame?
                            If you think a corporate lawyer cannot touch you, for an innocent statement like what Knee made, then you haven't met enough of these guy my man. That's all I'm saying. Most lawyers do what they do, to make your life hard, and have you submit. Nothing more than that, they don't even want to go to court.

Anyways, I'm not implying Bamco did anything here. And this pretty much useless discussion has run its course. Its naive you think you can't be sued for something you didn't do. You absolutely can, and a lot of times, even people as big and backed up as international celebrities are made to pay, on a case that has zero merits whatsoever. So unless you live in a state / country with good anti SLAPP laws or some version of it, you're fully liable to be bullied. Its a hard fact to accept, but it goes on every single day around the world.
                                I am not saying people don't get frivolous lawsuits. I am saying the threat of a frivolous lawsuit is not there in this situation. There is nothing to work with.
He said it wasn't fun and that's fine it's his opinion. Unfortunately people online love to argue over who is wrong or right. Everything is a masterpiece or completely shit to some people. It's annoying.
    I think he's not quite used to his personal opinion having so much influence, especially on a global scale with social media. So good on him that he's beginning to recognize it.
        That might be it too.
I think he’s sorry for not expanding on his opinion knowing how many he influences,

When you have that kind of influence you need to say what you mean from the get go; it’s very hard to walk back on statements that were taken more negatively than they were meant to be
He's only apologizing because people are quick to use his opinion as validation of their own. This just turns into this negative spiral that affects the FGC even outside of Tekken sphere.
    People were using his (and other pros) opinions as ammunition to shit on the game. Shitting on the game relentlessly does nothing but hurt the game. Critisize, for sure, but if all you're doing is shouting from the rooftops about how fucking shit Tekken is and it's never going to be fixed, it's going to turn people away from coming into the game and that is a BAD thing long term.

It's just stupid you can't say anything positive about the game or be hopeful without being labelled a dickrider or shill for Bandai/Harada. It's like man, I know the game has problems but I still enjoy it and think it can be amazing.
        I feel the same.  It's like opinions have to be definitive instead of fluid.  I don't think that's what Knee was doing but people used his post as you said for ammo.  It's never the game needs some tuning and it will get better.  It seems to always be the game is broken and Namco has no ability to make adjustments.
        It's definitely not shit. It's just severely unbalanced right now and favors rushdown characters too much. But that's nothing that can't be fixed. That the game is crammed with a cynical business model and lazy content is a different issue, however...
            It's also pit a bad taste in people's mouth by having 3 different types of monetisation post launch with no notice. Their is a distrust, and rightfully so.
        To be fair people spent money on this game and don't have to be happy about anything.  So people have the right to be drama queens about this, especially with what happened with MK1 and Now T8 is running into some of the same issues and all this was after SF6 came out that they should've learned from.
            No being a shithead is just being a shithead whether you paid for it know doesn't justify the constant. Oh, this game is shit I'm right your wrong, oh knee said something negative see I was right.

It's all dumb, criticise don't bitch
I don't know when this community became nothing but bitching but God its exhausting.

Those things ruin the community as well, it makes people not want to engage with the community.
Every one bitching about every character makes people not want to play x character.

This community needs to take a breath and decide if they want the game to get better or just fail because right now it feels like a lot of people just want to see it fail which to me if you like tekken is weird.
                Being a shithead is being a shithead, and being a unfun game is being an unfun game.  I'd always rather people speak on how they feel than just pretend to like something.  That's how we end up with mediocre games.   I don't see anyone saying they want the game to fail, that's not even the conversation right now.  

  
The only people I see wanting it to fail are those who pretty much got played with the sneaky battle pass they added after the game is out like capcom did.  IN that they have every right to be angry.
        Exactly, and I think that may be why Knee posted this clarification. The dude absolutely loves Tekken, and the last thing he would want would be for people to use his comments to support their vehement and relentless trashing of the game. I swear it feels like some people here actually want the game to fail, and there's no way Knee would want to encourage or validate that kind of sentiment.
        Holy shit they get it! Crazy how this subreddit of all places seems to actively want it to fail......
    Was especially funny considered that 99% of the players that felt validated by it are not even close to playing the same game as knee. His tekken is not your tekken. He is complaining about things most of these clowns dont even comprehend and they all just sitting their nodding their head because they just lost to someone spamming a duckable string on them 5 times in a row.
He's probably getting harassed in DMs. That's the simplest answer.
It’s ridiculous how much shit people will get for sharing valid and thoughtful criticism. Not everyone is an English major, someone doesn’t have to make a double spaced 10 page dissertation on what they don’t like in a game for it to be valid criticism. You got rando Jim trying to discredit and shame fucking Knee of all people because they love the game and he doesn’t.  It’s insane it’s come to this point.
    Remember that foreign language review that Harada called out for calling the game's DLC "P2W"? And the community got so angry that it was taken down and replace with a positive review?

Here we are 3 months later. 

The #1 character is DLC Eddie.

And a pro player who's primary language is not English is also having every word picked apart and analyzed with whatever context people want to apply to it.
Toxic positivity trying to kill integrity and honesty once again. This sub is full of it
    Toxic positivity overtook the OW playerbase when 5v5 was announced and now Overwatch 2 is bleeding players at a faster rate than ever. People are so terrified of public opinion turning on their favorite game that they put their fingers in their ears and shout "LA LA LA I can't hear you!" when valid criticism comes up. The responses in the previous Knee thread weren't blind pessimism, everyone seemed to be pointing out specific issues and how they could be changed.

I haven't even played T8 due to injury so I have no clue whether the game is good or bad. I know from watching what happened to OW2 though that it's going to be bad for T8 long term if half the playerbase keeps trying to dismiss any criticism bc of the short-term effect it has on public perception.
        > I know from watching what happened to OW2 though that it's going to be bad for T8 long term if half the playerbase keeps trying to dismiss any criticism bc of the short-term effect it has on public perception.

on the flipside, it's going to be bad for T8 long term if people only see the community shitting on the game. which is what it currently looks like as someone who isn't super into tekken. i've seen one example of toxic positivity and about 400 posts saying that tekken 8 is a trash game that can't be redeemed
            Naw it'll be okay,  SF5 and T7 got crapped on a lot and were still okay in the long run.   Besides the hardcore don't really care so long as money is on the line, and casuals don't really care so long as what they have works.  That's the problem here, even for hardcore and casuals there's some real bad problems with the game.
    Have you been on this sub in the last two months? Are you seriously going to claim it's overall positive on the game?
        There is a huge storage of copium over there, at that Justin Wong post. You might wanna check that out before discussing the curious nuances of the concept of "overall opinion", which you're clearly lacking
            Right, it hasn't been nothing but hating for months. Maybe look at the sub before you make claims about it.

Chip damage should've remained a kicharge perk.
Yeah, its BORING.
I wish I could pinpoint what point in time hame devs decided “fast and aggressive” is the way to make multiplayer games.
yes, that's what people are missing about the game - it's BORING after a while.
    Cuz the best part of high level tekken ,even decent ranked player are the footsies and neutral play (pokes+movement pressure) its the exciting part imo ,also having good defense(movement which is way worse now) and punishment, it feels kinda extinct mostly.
It's poorly designed all around but the new school players mostly don't understand this because they are being fed wins they dont deserve. It's grating and exhausting losing to coin flips and shows no mastery what so ever.
    I agree completely and the moment I got to purple ranks in Tekken 8 and was still being matched with super aggressive button mashers was really the moment that it hit me.

A fair chunk of these players in upper red/lower purple, they wouldn't have made it out of yellow/orange ranks in Tekken 7. More than once I have said out loud 'how are you even in this rank omg', while I'm fighting someone that refuses to stop pressing buttons. 

It's kinda sad to see really. I was hoping to be playing T8 off and on for quite a few years. Sadly it seems that this new iteration and direction is just not aimed at me.
He is probably seeing a lot of people take his quote out of proportion, and he is trying to reassure people that it's not as bad as people are taking it.
Namcops called
Bc people on the internet get offended by anything that isn't kisses in the butt about the things they like
Blame the new intern.
He got a phone call to call himself an old fuck on social media? Yeah makes total sense
I actually feel bad for steve,claudio,drag,law mains who mastered their hard shit for years only to make all these shit accessable for newcommers, also as nina player, there is no reason to do butterflies , they are useless now, also lili's dew glide cancels that also hard af, just no reason for this.
The issue isn't that they moved how the game plays. Its that it wasn't done with much thought in mind. There's a loads of problems with how the new systems interact with the underlying Tekken dynamics that just don't make sense. So its not the what was done, but the how it was done.

The issue is though the games been out for 3 months and we barely have any real meaningful changes to things that matter. On top of issues like plugging still being an issue which you would think would be a top priority to fix in the game, instead of making a hit list in excel.
T8 is a good game as a package, but a terrible fighting game and even worse as a competitive game.
LMAO
You mean the game that moved 11.8 million units? I agree. It didn’t appeal to enough people.
    Sold 11.8 million units but has a higher percentage player drop of rate in 3 months then Tekken 7? Is clear the intention was to make money with this game with cinematic easy to play mechanics then retain players long term. 

When the newbies who get better at the game become veteran players and are left with the core mechanics of thr game after a year or two they will see the issue to and see the layer of depth pulled from thr game because as you become higher level you want higher depth. It's what rewards you to keep going and get better. You can only steam roll someone soo much before it stops being fun.
        Yep, fully agreed.
Tbh Tekken 7 was out for ten years and that time meant players weren’t used to new games coming out that are a response to the perceived issues with the previous game. It is particularly common for devs to nerf or change the strong defense options that arise when a game has been out for so long it has been “solved”.
They want that worldwide money
Namco didnt do shit, the community called them out on it. As many people that agree with them, the same amount of people were talking back at them.
    In case you didn't notice, I was joking, I have no idea if they got money or not, neither you know or anyone else, but influencers (I believe we can call them like that) have impact big enough that it's in publisher business to take good care of them, right? Simple logic, if I could pay someone who is followed by many, I would pay because it's beneficial to me, so... we don't know, but somehow both top players change their mind, IDK man, weird coincidence ;)
Right , powercrushen8 to armor their attacks and steal your turn with dumb move named heatburst, you cant hold back, you have to press something to steal your turn (mashen8), you cant even move out of pressure cuz thats also tracken 8, fun game indeed.
    It's all counter striking as opposed to just blocking

An actual reason to not like the game is that they simply just gave some dudes incredibly good tools and not others so like many fighting games you just see the same dudes over and over.  Even then though, the usage data has a better spread then a lot of games

Then there is the scummy monetization which is actually pretty fucking stupid
Balance can be made,  o balance will change their philosophy of "aggressivu gampelay" and no thing will be changed when dumbfuck Murray said," just block, why would you ever sidestep".
Any ‘dangerous’ low is almost always guarantee launch punishable excl dumb shit like jin d2 being -12 LMAO
    jins d2 is a prime example of what im talking about
         it’s the only example unless u can name another low that is ch launchsble and is -12
Bro, the internet practically fetishizes the notion of nuance. T8's problems aren't complicated and they're self-evident.
Just a question, how does blindly mashing buttons result in wins? That’s the best way to get abused by knowledgeable players.
    Cause everyone isn’t a knowledgeable player.
        He said worse and worse going into purple ranks. I find that hard to believe.
            purple ranks are dogshit at the gaem 

rank inflation is super high in that gaem, purple ranks in t8 are like yellow ranks in t7
            Considering the spike in new players Tekken 8, the rampant plugging problem that only recently started becoming more manageable, and possibly a third problem I’m not aware of. It’s not impossible for it to be a problem of lacking knowledge.
                There's no way button mashers survive the red ranks. They can probably reach red but that won't last long.
                    Just depends on how smart they are with button mashing. Most characters can kill in two launches/ combos.
                        But if they're being smart, that's no longer mashing. They're understanding the game now.
                            Hmm yes and no. I know what you mean as it is playing smarter but there’s still mashing in how it’s performed. Like with how Eddie is on his debut. Tons of people winning off of lack of knowledge and mashing a single button. When people say button mashing they don’t always mean random inputs. They just means a constant string of inputs.
                                But if they still act when it's not their turn, they get punished. Like I said, there's no way mashers survive red, moreso purple.
I have to disagree. I think defense is still incredibly important the higher you get. Blindly mashing can reward you at lower ranks potentially but the higher you get you’re just exposing yourself to getting launched twice and killed. It’s not a defensive oriented game but blocking is still crucial.
    Yeah ive made it to purples with a pretty defensive playstyle, i havent really bothered learning setups or abusing my plus frames and optimizing combos yet.
I will soon and see how it changes things but i want to keep climbing until i plataeu then work on those things. But ducking high strings and launching dumb shit and whiff punishing as gotten me pretty far on its own.
        Exactly. If you’re a bit patient in this game you can benefit from the stupidly potent offensive options.
            Part of the problem is your offense has to be just as good as your defense. Or your defense has to be leagues better to compensate now is how it feels to me. I tried playing defensively, and I still "try". But with all the bullshit going on, and just how much quicker people feel in next gen fighting games (maybe I'm just getting old) I find myself quickly saying "if I try to block and punish and lose the interaction TWICE I'm cooked. My best shot is to throw out my fastest/most unexpected combos." I feel as if I'd have to put 300 hours of defensive practice in against each character just to learn 1/3rd of the options I'd have to react to and feel any degree of comfort while on defense
                Yeah that makes sense. I don’t think you even need to know the opposing character to any significant degree and react to every single move they throw with the perfect counter, but at a minimum if you can recognize when it’s not your turn because of a frame disadvantage for example that’s already a huge plus. I think a combination of safe moves leading to launchers, CHs, etc. is pretty effective.
                    Duly noted. Will keep add this to my notes and keep it in mind while practicing. Also want to add that I usually feel like I'm pretty decent at reading breaks and pauses and finding the right time to poke in and interrupt or punish. Just the more time I've spent on tekken the more I've realized I'm not that good at it. I get *really* messed up by players like Jun or a GOOD Zafina that either has natural fake pauses in their combos or is good at leaving enough time to make you think there's enough time to interrupt only to get CH Launched
    I have to disagree. Currently at Tekken King rank and man if it aint a huge mashfest. defense isnt really important to be honest, just dont mash when its heavily the opponents turn and sadly youre good to go. so many stances have insane evasion, kenpo is absurd (and the fact that they gave it to more characters, ugh.) all you gotta do is just rush your opponent down with insane plus frames, oh its finally your turn? No its not, heat burst. Chip damage is ridiculous. Defense doesnt work because one of the million forced 50/50s is eventually going to get you since theres practically no counterplay to many of them. im super frustrated so sorry if it sounds like im being a crybaby but this is just how i feel.
        I’m at King too and I don’t see the mash fest to be honest. Maybe we have different definitions of mashing lol. When I was lower ranked yeah I could see dudes just spamming all kinds of BS but here there is some calculation involved and timing when to do shit, generally speaking. 

I think where you said don’t mash when it’s heavily the opponents turn is key. That’s in effect defending. It’s a simple concept but a lot of people suck at doing that. So my point wasn’t that you should play defensively in general but that it’s extremely important to know when to block and when to attack especially in a Tekken where blindly throwing out moves can result in you losing half your life.
            You're playing King, bro lmao nobody will be mashing, no one wants to take a low ch that deals 50 damage or or a ch throw and then you die or heat smash that deals 60 damage.
                 tekken king rank, not king the character
                    Ah then my apologies, mate
                    For real though, is the guy blind? Cant he see you re a Gon main?
                        That elite 2 foot hit box!
    I agree, was stuck in reds but I realized that I have to block more. The more defense I incorporated in my game, the more success I got in my matches, esp the most annoying match-ups.
        Yeah and the great thing about simply blocking is that it gives you a chance to see how your opponent likes to play and then react accordingly.
Can guarantee your complaints are not the same complaints as the pro’s considering this is your first tekken game. No offense but you probably can’t even react to snake edge. You probably get spammed by Drags W2. Your frustrations are a skill issue while the pro’s frustrations are an issue of “this doesn’t feel like the game i took years to learn.”
    The pros are complaining that defense is unrewarding in this game, which is literally the exact same complaint as the one I have. You're right, I might get caught off guard by a snake edge once, as I don't really expect people to use them in purple ranks. Don't know what a "W2" is, maybe you're referring WR2 which I find rather easy to sidestep.


I wish my frustrations were a skill issue since I enjoy learning and finding solutions to problems, but I feel like the solution to most challenges currently in the game is just being more relentless in your aggression than your opponent, which doesn't really take a lot of skill imo (and the pros seem to agree)
        You do not have fundamental defensive skills remotely good enough to judge how rewarding defense is in this game. 

Offense is stronger than defense in every game at lower levels because defense is inherently harder to learn. 

You don't know if defense is unrewarding in tekken 8. You are just trash. And so am I
            Ok, but most of the pros are saying that defense is unrewarding in T8. Are they just trash too?
                Ppl are just trying to tell you that in your couple months timespan with the game, your defence is more than likely still pretty weak so you cant really grasp how good defence is not rewarding. 


If you were playing T7 u d still get blown up by opponent offense bc defence is harder to learn than offense in any game. But good defence can be learnt eventually, however its less rewarding in T8.
        You don’t “get” it
            And the pros don't get it either I'm guessing?
                Nah they get it,you don’t
I mean tbf he has. Just not with anything he’s posted but more of what he and other top players do in tournaments.
Honest feedback is good, negative or positive. And in bamco’s case, the executives argue with their own fan base about things that are universally wanted, like plug penalties.. so not instilling high levels of confidence for the future of the game. 

I’m all for positivity but not blind positivity. 

I think tekken will be fine either way, and tbh I would rather it fail because of negative feedback as opposed to fake positive feedback allowing it to succeed only to be a shitty dumbed down game. It’s a lose lose but I’d prefer the game get hated for not being good or be loved because it is good… not be loved regardless just so it keeps existing. 

I’m not even suggesting that tekken is that bad right now, I just see no value in people pretending they like it and hope it gets fixed instead of voicing their opinions before it’s too late.
    Yeah but the game was super well received. Reviews were great, this sub was booming with cool stuff until the shop showed up. That was the beginning of the end. All the good credit they earned was lost and now that's the reason the negativity is overwhelming. The game is still the same base game but it's tainted with all this other stuff now.
        No, the negativity was alive and well for a number of reasons, netcode, performance, plugging, just lots of random issues. 

Then the team doubling down on the ban list etc. 

The good faith was lost. Then as people figured out the game it became more and more obvious how oppressive offense is and how defensive expression is limited. “Why sidestep when you can block”

The game is dope, but the straws have been stacking up on the camels back, it’s not just one thing.

The mxts just put them on blast, all the other negative stuff was more of a critique of the hardcore crowds.
            Yeah but not at launch. It was well received. The issue started when plugging was rampant and they did nothing about it BUT they released a shop. The shop came out a month after launch so we had a decent run. That just solidified that they don't really care about us or the game, they just want our money. That was basically the beginning of the end.
                The game had critiques from the get go. The general media is the only outlet that has changed the narrative. 

It’s not hard to google people talking about all these same problems the first month. We just had a lot of hope and good faith.

Now the game has been out, many flaws that are obvious have been poorly handled, and the mxt stuff just made it all look way worse. 

I agree the game was well received from a broad brush perspective, but at the core, the gameplay issues have been talked about since beta.

*I still think it’s a good ass game and I think most people do, the negativity is because it’s not what it could be*
The old Tekken development cycle of Japanese and Koreans essentially beta-testing on arcades seems to have been better for not letting this kind of negativity spread. Now that the entire world is part of the refining process of Tekken when once they would have expected a more polished product from the start, it's really doing a number on the perception of this game.
    Big time. Steam charts show the playerbase plummeting. Expected for a fighting game since it's a niche market BUT it's trending to be less than what T7 was. That's not a good sign. Less players means they're going to up the microtransactions to compensate. It's a domino effect.
        I just responded to this in another thread, but that's not true. Both games have nearly idnetifcal three month trends, both splayerbases shrinking by the same percentage (around 35% per month). The big difference is T8 started with 40k and T7 started with around 12k.
            Interesting. I guess we need a larger sample size. Might spike after EVO if it's hype, that generally brings in new players.
It’s funny seeing this community go through the MKX/11 cycle in real time
    Literally. We were all shitting on MK when T8 released because we were the new kings of the FGC. Then we started getting slapped around with microtransactions and pros crying that the game is unfair because they're losing too much. Been a wild 3 months.
        Crazy how it's only been three months. It's been a rollercoaster already
            Yeah, I don't think this is good for the longevity of the game. T7 overall was pretty smooth until the busted DLCs showed up but that was years after the launch.
                It's true though that when T7 got released, it had technically already been out for a few years to become smooth.

I think a lot will depend on how the tournaments will turn out and how they are received. Can we get anything as hype as T7 tournaments in this game? Hard to say with how volatile the gameplay is. The methodical style of T7 might have its flaws but it made close games much more intense to watch because they lasted longer
                    As boring as the overly defensive gameplay was, it actually helped build a lot of tension knowing that something still had to give and the fight would begin in earnest. T8 has virtually none of that suspense and feels more like a Wild West quick-draw showdown.
                    Evo is going to be a big test for this games tournament scene. If it's well received the game will keep growing. If not we're in trouble.
        As a new player who still doesn't care too much about franchise although I REALLY do enjoy Tekken 8.

I can only imagine the cries of the players if they would deliver Tekken 9 as a fullgame. 1 balance patch and that's it. Even less skins than now. Go the MK route. And then also deliver

No mtx. No dlc's. No updates for 5 years. Pretty sure this would make ppl quit even faster lol
            T7 survived for almost ten years and the only content we got were characters. That game was great. They abandoned it towards the end to focus on T8 but it was still super active.

I don't think this game will have the same life span or sales.
                I was a nolife gamer for the years where T7 was out and I didn't even know the game existed or had any playerbase

For the most part from what I see Tekken had around 4k active players even in 2016 XD

Yea survived is a good phrase. All I see is current community making sure T8 won't be bought by potentially interested new players for the next 4years
                    T7 was a game made with a budget of 3 happy meals and 0 marketing after a failed last game. T8 is coming in with massive marketing and budget +goodwill of the people that it built up in T7 and is looking to end up in the same or worse place than T7 was.
Subscribing to this sub was definitely a mistake. I bought Tekken 8 out of nostalgia from playing Tekken 3 as a kid and I think the game is great. So I subscribed to this subreddit thinking that people would share tips, greats matches, and so on. But no, most of what I see here is people whining and it is affecting how I view the game.
    Yeah this sub has devolved into a mess. When the game first game out it was great, super exciting. The constant plugging and now all these trash shop items has pretty much ruined that vibe.
    You gotta just wait a little longer eventually this sub will be purified and it will be more of the tips and strategies you're looking for and a lot more Waifu fan art posts.   I expect the May patch to drop overreactions on both sides then we get back to talking about actually playing the game and not arm chair devs.
You don't think bamco is more likely to make changes when knee makes complaints compared to when some random person on reddit does?
    No because they don't cater Tekken to pros. The money is with casuals.
        Yeah, I guess so. That's why the game has mixed reviews on steam
            People have been review bombing the game ever since the Micro transactions got announced it has nothing to do with the actual game
                mtx is in the game though so it literally does have things to do with the game. And wtf is this review bombing shit, you think you can convince thousands of people to do what they dot want to do? if the mtx wasn't a problem people wouldn't be reviewing it badly, review bombing doesn't exist especially when you have to buy the game.
            Which sucks because I think the game is really fun just needs some tweaks and less MTXs.
                Yeah :/ I've kind of dropped the game at this point. Maybe I'll try again after Evo japan, or one of my characters gets announced.
                    Sorry bro :(
If they want people to talk well about the game then they should make a good game
>You should make your honest criticisms without being so negative that you push all positivity and newcomers away

Why 'should' anyone silence themselves if they genuinely feel that negative towards it?
    There's a big difference between random reddit monsters and the pro known far as wide as (probably) the best Tekken player ever. Knee has a huge following and influence. It's worth it for people with influence considering how they talk and express their opinions, given they have an outsized impact on the community.
    For the sake of allowing positivity to still exist in the community. Overwhelming negativity discouraged those that have positive things to say from saying them. Nobody is forced to care about the state of the community they are in but their impact is undeniable
        Right, but you're just repeating yourself though.

Don't be negative because it pushes away positivity.  
Why does that matter?  
Because it pushes away positivity.

What is the actual benefit to those wanting a better game? Like, sure, shut up so redditor 136794 can post their cosplay, but how is that actually doing anything worth justifying shutting down discourse?
            Only speak positive, comrade
            If the people in the community aren’t comfortable talking about what makes the game good then you can’t expect to have an honest conversation about the state of the game.
                Then just talk about it though? Why is the presence of some people being negative bad for discussions, while you specifically wanting to disallow people from vocalizing in specific ways healthy?

Either have the discussion or don't, but you can't expect to police how people express themselves when that's exactly what's needed to gauge the state of the game's reception. Both ways.
                    Ideally people aren’t affected by other peoples opinions and so whatever ratio of positivity to negativity is how the audience actually feels. In reality whenever the initial reaction to something is extremely negative most people that would have something positive to say, will not want to do so. I’m not acting like this is something that people are willing to fix themselves, i’m just pointing out what’s happening
                        Fair enough, not trying to dismiss the validity of newcomers possibly being pushed away. However, having everyone misrepresent their own opinions to match some sort of acceptable range (so long as it's not actual bullying or spreading hate of course) is no more acceptable of a solution than telling more positive minded users to refrain from praising any element until the smoke clears.

With the key point being that positivity only rewards the current state of the game and encourages devs in what many believe to be very incorrect decisions, and just straight up manipulation in some sense, then you're artificially pushing aside negativity that needs to be heard as well. And it's that kind of behavior that causes us to end up with lower quality products, MTX, etc.

Absolutely be positive if you want, praise the elements you like, and I recommend everyone do so, but not to the point where it becomes a toxic positivity circlejerk purely because "that's better than being negative".
            Welcome to the vibes era

Meaningful discourse isnt meant for casuals, just vibes
            I think the intention was to highlight that being more specific with criticism and less doom posting might make the community and the game better. But I can read minds over the internet.
Such an annoying way of thinking how ppl should behave, self censorship...
    Well yes we self censor ourselves all the time. Do you walk around telling everyone your opinion about things or them exactly you feel them? Probably not because you thought about what effect that would have on your relationship with them and other people. And like I stated, I am not saying you have an obligation to care about this, but that the effect is obvious.
Because T7 has a lot of technical issues largely ironed out in 8, like the horribly long and extremely frequent loading screens. Not to mention, T8 has proper(ish?) rollback netcode and largely (sorry, Steve) better visuals.

Trust me, if Bamco were to release a Tekken 5DR remake with modern online and QoL, both 7 and 8 would be in coffins the next day, with the hypothetical 9 joining them on release assuming it adopts recent design philosophies.
    Damn. I've never even played Tekken 5. I haven't jumped on 8 yet due to all the drama. Will continue to wait a bit.
Tell hell do you mean lol have you seen the crowd watching tekken 7 tournaments? Was fun as hell and we had incredible moments, just go to YouTube and watch, I can even send to you if you want
    I’ve seen them. Uh duh the crowd that’s there is gonna be hype they’re there supporting there favorites.  I also remember nothing but Leroy’s and everyone crying into metaphorical megaphones about that too.
    Nah that's bs. At the start yes, people were hype about the slowmos etc. But the game had several bs patches like when literally everyone was playing leroy and I also remember CONSTANT crying about how 2ds ruin the game. And thousands of sleepyfaces in twitch chat when it was just players backdashing on infinite stages. 

The offline crowd at events is always going to be hype. They are right there. Ofc theyll cheer. Wont be any different for T8 although the crowd will be bigger.
The negative Nancy’s are annoying, but they won’t kill the game.  And 2XKO will get shitted on by picky fans as well, that’s just the nature of the FGC
    It will but it’s riot. Riot while money hungry, knows how to keep a game competitive and fun enough to retain massive amounts of players just because it’s riot.
yea people mashing rage art way more enjoyable.
    Do we really need to cover this again? Rage art is borderline useless if you’re fighting someone not garbage. In combos it’s scaled heavily. And not in combos easily readable and avoidable. Rage art is at the very bottom of issues with the game. T7 also had that so…you’re just saying shit. And you can’t “spam” a move you get one time per round lmao. Warrior opinion.
        idky y’all be acting like top player’s don’t use rage art. rage art + heat smash is cancer.
            It’s really not and you’re not even on topic anymore. It was in t7. Heat smash is harder to deal with sure. Still not game breaking. Oh no you get 50/50d just like in every other tekken game or fighting game 🥴🥴🥴
                well in my opinion it is. heat smash + rage art + power crush heat engagers are cancer. idc what u talkin bout. ur obviously some loser ass nigga who thinks his opinion matters cuz he slightly decent at tekken.
                    Lmao you’re such a pussy and that’s evident. Why would anyone care about what someone who is just a whiner and garbage have to say anyway? Your opinion is just stupid. You can’t even speak  your some broke ass uneducated actual loser in everything you do, don’t be mad at me for it
                        bruh stop all that yappin lol u claim ur life better than mine so lets prove it. all i said was u being good at tekken was irrelevant to life and you starting goin off on a tangent. must be insecure about some things lol.
                            Nah you came up in here on my shit first. If you could read, you’d have noticed I said FROM and then elaborated that I’m from, not IN, meaning I live somewhere else, Baltimore. I see the education quality hasn’t changed there at all. Sad. You’re just another wanna be dime a dozen tough dude when you start realizing you’re saying stupid shit “come and see irl” LMAO anybody saying that shit isn’t scary, can’t fight, and ain’t shit. You’re the insecure one and that’s exactly why you resort to such a stupid thing to say.
                                But super congrats on being the dumbest fuck I’ve ever seen in this sub. Don’t get shot in Baltimore trying to be what you ain’t 🤷‍♀️
                                bro i said stop all that yappin either prove u on sum or just shut ur monkey mouth. I’m not from baltimore #1 and if you can’t understand what i’m saying that shows how ignorant you are, not me. so once again, stop yappin, you said your life better than mine lets prove it. We in the same area 🤔
        There are legit criticisms but “wahhh wage art” isn’t one of them.
            that’s your opinion. acting like your some top player and you can dictate what people have issue with doesn’t help anything 🤣
                Im not dictating what you have an issue with I’m saying it’s not a legitimate issue. You’re just a scrub.
                    bro idc what u think i am, u being good at tekken means absolutely nothing in life lol.
                        Ah my point. We’re talking about tekken tho so…”hehe you’re good at game but not life” typical last resort when you’re losing an argument. Time to log off scrub. My life is still better than yours too so 🤷‍♀️
                            idc about your point lol you called me a scrub, so im telling you. you being good at a video is irrelevant to the grand scheme of life. 😂 and if u from baltimore we can link up and see who life really better 🤔
                                From and living in are different things buddy. You ain’t scary pussy
cuz this is from his team, not himself idiot. LMAO :D
Most of new players are gonna quit as soon as people block their mash and they get mashed I instead
People just want the parts of the tekken identity that were removed to come back
HMU when you win a FT10 against Knee
When someone says he can't adapt when he is in god of destruction rank, we call it humility
Kbd is the coolest part of tekken. It's what got me into the game.
    Yes, the coolest part that turn tekken 7 into Tower Defense.

Kill it and the game become better, no more walling game.
        You used backdash to create whiffs... that's the whole point
            KBD is an exploit, it is not a mechanic, the reason they made backdash nerfed is literally because they aren't meant to be like that
            Backdash is a thing

korean backdash is another thing

Whats the matter to play a FIGHT GAME that players go running back back back?

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFTBLQZ-Cis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFTBLQZ-Cis)

Killing it make much better to game system.
        Does get good apply here? It’s all just movement bru.
I actually think there being no infinite stage makes up for KBD quite a lot. Still annoying but at least there’s a limit. Eventually they will have their back to the wall
They killed movement in T6.0 and the game felt stiff and horrible. Killing movement will ruin the game.
Good Lord what a bad take.

Tekken IS MOVEMENT and kbd is a part of it. Even if you remove kbd completely people will still cancel backdash with sidestep. So what now, gonna kill backdash into sidestep too? Whats next, remove fuzzy guard?
Old man Knee arc!
You don't get that good at a game by thinking you know everything, gotta have the humility to keep learning.
This is what I had to learn and accept when SFIV came out.  I was so used to the old way of Capcom fighters, that I just couldn’t adapt to the new style.

I’ve gotten better with them as time has gone on, but I’m nowhere near as good as I was then.  Of course, age has gone way up and playtime has gone way down, so that’s as much of it as anything else.
The self-awareness and humility of the glazing on this post 🤣🤣
He's saying the right thing. But I think he knows deep down T8 will never be as fun as the old Tekkens.


I know it's hard to accept, so people drink that copium.


The game sucks tho. It's that simple lol.


People like Knee can "try" to like it all they want, but you shouldn't have to try so hard to enjoy a video game. 


I think that's the main thing. He said he wasn't having fun and this is a common sentiment. The game just isn't as fun with the new direction. Rushdown gets old fast if there's no variety. When rushdown was just 1 style it was great. Variety is the spice of life.
he definitely shouldn't need to say sorry for not enjoying the game
Yup, no one with half a brain and a reputation to uphold will post their real thoughts on X.

            I'm misspelling some words on purpose. At first its cause I was lazy and did not know how to spell "probably" right and always spelled probly, but now I'm doing it on purpose cause chat bots and ai don't do stuff like that and I think it's just more fun, although I still use proper grammer for essays and stuff
                You did that last one on purpose, didn’t you?
    Arsenal. Oscar Kazama. Hello amigos.
    I could have googled but was too lazy.  Lol :)
All I can think when about when I see this Tekken stuff is that Sajam segment he did like a week ago. 

He put into words what ive been thinking about video games discourse online in general for the longest time.
I doubt either one of them cares what sajam had to say about a Tekken game
Lol, arsal !!, he won evo 4 times, you should at least know his name if you watch tekken tournaments.
    I am super ADHD, so details like this often escape me.  I have a vague enough idea of their name to recognize it if I see it, but not enough to spell it.
Thats because him and arsenal are both getting clobbered at locals. They kinda always tweet right after getting smashed, which makes for more heated takes. So in comparison this is knee being calmed down and more self-aware.
    True. Arsenal had a very rough couple of days, but im not sure if knee would fare better against Bayern. Tho his defensive style may be difficult to crack.
Well i know Arslan has been in the US getting washed up by the players here… feels like thats why he changed his mind
Usually it's just a way of saying "this person is spittin facts"
    Ok now I know the meaning, but from where this comes from, based? Like based on something?
        [https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/based](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/based)
            I’m glad Lil B gets his flowers on this because he literally came up with the slang and now people don’t even realize how strongly it’s associated with him
                Lil B had waaay more influence than people will ever give him credit for lol
                    ya ill contribute to this tangent. i love that man. real ones know
                Yeah man he's from Berkeley/Oakland. I remember my friend Natasha now known as Kreayshawn used to shoot videos for Lil B. She began a music career when she saw how easy it was to do music videos and go viral
        Idk the origin really and as far as i know it's not really used in a "based on this.." way. It's actually kind of a running meme that ppl reply "based on what?" When they don't understand how or why the word is being used that way. Sorry if this explanation is lacking.
            Nah you're good, thank you.
        based on your mom lmao gottem
        Literally just means that the person is standing on a strong ideological base and that they aren't likely to be pushed off of it because it is strong. Overwhelmingly used as a compliment, although it is possible to be based on a flawed foundation.
Internet edgelords took it from lil b
It means they're based in Reddit: they live here.
Yeah that's what makes it so sad. Here you have a man who devoted large chunks of his live to Tekken and build a career of it just for an army of red ranks go "Loly git gud scrub." 

This is so undignified.
    It also goes the other way I doubt he wants people to use his opinion to validate shitting on the game because they're hardstuck red.

Which is what a lot of people are doing, a lot of complaints pros make are specific to that level of tekken and for them it's also their job.

I literally saw someone saying nothing should be faster than a 10f jab that breaks the rules of tekken then they complain that flash is a 9 frame start up that robs their turn.
As if yoshis flash hasn't been around since tekken 3

I'm all for criticising the game but it's just a tiring seeing people rush to shit on it as it is to defend it
That's what I thought it was when the heat system and chip was announced. But then the day I got the game I was like "where tf did 20% of my health go???".
    \*record scratches\*

Wait, why do I remember hearing/reading you wouldn't get chip unless it was heat? Did I just lose to translation? Chip damage happens outside of heat? 

If this just grey health system? 

Ooof, maybe 1 too many systems in place.
        You take chip damage "grey health" when you block attacks. You regen grey health when you attack whether its blocked or it hits. Engaging heat heals all your grey health. You lose when all your red health is gone, though you can't be chipped to death.

When tekken 8 was announced and the new systems talked about. I thought chip only happened while in heat. But thats not true. Which seems weird.
        Not all moves add chip damage.  But those that do give chip damage in heat or not.  (Damage goes up in heat though)
This would've been fine

Like how in SF6, they made it so chip only happens when you're in burnout state
    I really like the drive gauge in sf6. It’s powerful but if you go too ham burnout can be really punishing.
I agree. As much as I enjoy Tekken 8, I do think chip damage should just happen after you activate heat mode. It kind of makes no sense to have chip damage happen under any other circumstance really. I noticed chip damage happen when I played a few days ago when neither of us were in Heat and thought that was weird. I get that the direction is all about offense and I do broadly support that, but you shouldn't be punished for blocking something successfully in this way.
    Some moves have innate chip properties like Asuka's ff1+2 and running 1+2 for example. As for the heat chip damage debate i am all for it since you gain back that health by attacking. It is a mechanic  meant to punish turtiling up which alot of intermediate and beginner players often do. Now i will agree that the amount of chip damage should be lowered a bit as well as overall damage in some areas.
        I mean...are you sure that beginner and intermediate players are the ones who do the turtling? I would much rather say that advanced and pro players tend to turtle way more and beginners and intermediates tend to learn strings and flowcharts and spam them all the time.
            Its about 50/50 in my experience. Its not that beginners are blocking everything it just that i noticed that some tend to slowly back walk away instead of trying to attack. As in i would do a clearly unsafe option and they just back walk and avoid interaction. I dont know how beginner Jins ive played that just back walk and the moment i go for an interaction demon paw or Bryan u4. Now it could just be my luck or region but about 85% of my online matches are overly defensive players both beginner and intermediate, 5% intermediate/advanced spammers, and the rest are a mixed grab bag of players who kinda what they are doing.
                I have a totally different experience, honestly. Beginners are overly aggressive and tend to mash even when they're heavily under frames or they throw the most unsafe but flashy move. Intermediates tend to keep the distance and approach with safe moves like Jin's ff2 because it is actually a more "thought through" way to play the game. Advanced and pro players usually pick you apart with movement usually using only ultra-safe strings and pokes.
It's a problem, even in heat, imo. I don't understand, why Reina (3+4, 4, 4) or Victor (expulsion) can just press a "free damage" button and chip me for like 20 damage with barely any ways to counterplay them safely and reliably.
    at least chip cant kill you. i know the situation you're talking about, though. 

In MK11 you could get heroic chip out, which is just a fancy way of saying you died to a safe block strong with 0 counter play.
    I mean Victor's Explosion is -17 on block or something like that, so even if you take chip damage you can get that health right back simply by punishing that same Explosion which is an unsafe move.
        not in heat it's not, it's safe during heat
Yes. Just yes.
I kinda get why it works outside of heat to counteract health regain, but I think they should nerf chip till its the same or slightly worse than health regain cause that would incentives attacking without making blocking bad
Or rage or something.  Also why is totally normal damage recoverable what are the rules what is happening
    Juggles and OTGs leave recoverable health. Its really not that complicated lol
        Idk if I can give you "it's not that complicated"
Heat is where you heal chip damage.
Honestly, the amount of chip damge should be scaled by howsafe or unsafe the move is on block. The safer it is the less chip damage it would do.

So, something like Drags running 2 would do extremely low chip damage, while Claudios wr2 should do a bit more than that simply because it can be ducked.
I think the chip damage would be fine if combo damage was scaled back and everythingelsewasbalanced. Even though he is hard to win with, Leroy, for example,  feels fair. Low single hit damage, fast hitting chip from chain punches, better than average combo damage. Zafina feels off however, with mid single hit damage, trash combo damage, and her best chip moves damaging her.
I'm in the same boat that there are other things that bother me more than chip. As a Claudio player though my strings are like 2/3 hit max. Reina/Hwaorang/Law etc they get like 6 hits in a row with safe strings. Interesting. 

anyways what are you biggest complaints? just curious.
Scrub
    What rank are you hon?
        I'll go ahead and post the anonymous tekken player bitching flow chart

1\. "I'm GoD"

"No you're not you're lying"

2\. "I'm TGS"

"Wow not even GoD? I am, don't talk to me"

3\. "Any other rank"

"I'm (your rank+3), scrub"

regardless you're a scrub with a bitchmade mentality
            Thank you for the meltdown, we all enjoy a good laugh 😂😂
                That was a pretty wild ride, wasn't it? Lol. 

  
I hope he doesn't delete the comment chain, that was a hell of a train wreck.
                Stay scrubby
                    Stay obese and miserable
                        project harder
                            Why do you talk like an incel?
Nah. It's all about the launch punish, flash ducking, sidestep punish this time around. They only beefed up Parry for Azucena. Everyone else has to low parry or use their toned down version of a standing parry. 

But I can say that Paul's parries are still pretty much intact from T7. I have a friend who mains him.
Well I'm no Tekken pro but I've seen enough pros playing in T7 tournaments to say that defense actually was the best strategy. Because block and whiff punishment and counter hits were (and still are) some of the most powerful tools a character and a player have. To know what you can punish and how is the greatest strength you can build as a player. 
To charge brainlessly with unsafe flow charts into a player who actually knows what he's doing is a death sentence.
That's not going to happen but they should probably adjust the frame advantage after. +17 is pretty crazy.
    Can you explain to me the frames on heat engagers? +17 should mean that i have a 17 frame move guaranteed after no? But its not like that right? Nothing is guaranteed after i do a heat engager?
        The opponent is in a forced block for 17 frames. They can't do anything but block.
        Like people have said, the opponent can still block and duck during those 17 frames. This kind of frame advantage is sometimes labeled as +17g where g I think stands for "guard" and many situations in the game have this, like Kazuya's df1,4 being +17g or something on hit and his db4 doing similar on counter hit, as opposed to Jin's 4 being a true +13 on ch and granting him guaranteed followups
        sometimes things that are +10 or more will still allow the opponent to block, it just depends on the moves. Heat Engagers always allow the opponent to block. You are right in your assumption that +17 should mean a 17 frame or faster move would hit, but tekken is complicated so it doesn't work that way in some instances.
        For most characters, their fastest move is 10f.

Being +17 means they cannot do anything else than block for the first 17 frames you can move. That means any move that's 26 frames or less (which is very slow) is uninterruptable.
        It means you can act 17 frames before your opponent can. It doesn't mean they can't block.
I'm with you.... I don't mind chip damange.... the heat system should be adjusted though. The game is just so much more fun without it. Feels so good to put a heat engager in their place w out using them myself.
Or do 3 all at once against Azucena, easy just get better l0l
    eeeezzzz
It is…
    Yeah I want it reduced even further
Except everything is +on block or safe so by the time it's your turn you already guessed wrong in one of 5000 50/50 situations and you've lost all that gray health. Then you try sidestepping and you get hit by a homing throw. Game is doodoo right now.
    its funny cause its mostly the safe and plus moves that chip
    You know why is the throw game so *weird*?? Like I get all the changes but they're incoherent.

I think making 1+2 break throws homing and all other throws *not homing* would be a cool move idk
    When a top tier like Drag or Jun puts you into the grinder at the wall, and even if you guess their mixups right on block (you can punish almost nothing cause everything is +), but they dont mind cause they chipping away my hp quite fast. The game literally makes you spam and discourage any calculated defensive play.
    Everything is + on block or safe? Lol, lmao even.
    I mean let's play through this scenario. Your opponent uses + moves on you several times in a row and at no point are you interrupting him, he has conditioned you. Then you guess a 50/50 wrong, whatever that's supposed to be (does not remove your grey health usually). Then you fail to break a throw that your opponent threw out because he predicted you would sidestep or further turtle up. Is your opponent not supposed to win that round?
If I'm a god at playing good defensive Tekken, I shouldn't be punished by the game for playing against someone who can't break turtles. I'm fine with the game overall having less CHs in general to sit on, to allow for more active engagements this time around, but offense is just way too oppressive and unnecessarily punishing right now, towards opponents who like to take their turns blocking for just about any reason. 

There needs to be a balance. Bamco needs to reward both styles of play.
    If you were a god at playing defensive Tekken, you should be able to sidestep/duck/low parry/interrupted at some point. Holding back and backdashing isn't good defensive Tekken. The issue is that there's some absurd moves in the game right now that track too well or are too plus where you don't have good options other than block. It's okay to be punished for blocking and rewarded for avoid attacks.
        This would be true if this game wouldnt be a 50/50 spam fest. You can learn strings and stuff but it all goes out of the window if you just have to guess.
        >implying the gods of defensive Tekken have been able to consistently sidestep/duck/low parry/interrupt things when it matters most to win them games. Except it doesn't.

Seems like you're missing the whole point. Strong defensive Tekken is not as well rewarded as it should be. Playing well in Tekken 8 is constantly attacking to run your game and making sure the other player isn't allowed to attack, or play the game. Blocking is important for other things aside from just deciding to turtle up and bait CHs.

"the issue is that there's some absurd moves in the game right now that track too well or are too plus where you don't have good options other than block"

So you agree with me. Offense is too oppressive and too punishing towards defensive players. You're being punished for blocking not because of chip damage, but because you're forced to constantly take mixups and are put into disadvantageous situations where you're just blocking. Not turtling, not trying to run out the clock. Just. Blocking.

That's the problem.
One of the posts in here that I saw said that chip damage is okay as long as it mostly happens in Heat Mode and not normal play, and I agree. That's where I stand on the issue mostly.
If it was real life, Kuma's 1 jab would decapitate you.
    I don’t know if you understand, but what makes real world fights engaging to watch (mma) is seeing you wither down a defending opponent, obviously not everything is going to be realistic, but the idea that you can’t just put your guard up forever is what creates engagement, that’s why when people watch muay thai, or boxing, they’re interested in how much damage someone incurred through leg kick checks or blocking punches. I think chip is necessary, but dodges should be more powerful.
        I actually really enjoy combat sports (mostly MMA but also some boxing), so I appreciate what you're saying, in that there's a rich combination of factors that make analyzing a fight enjoyable.

What I would offer you is that a fighter breaking down their opponent's defense is usually achieved by how effectively they can bypass the opponent's guard - going for the body, kicking the legs. You usually have to hit your opponent somewhere other than his guard in order to make your exertion worth it. In Tekken this is simulated by fast pokes that are easy to land but do just a little damage.

In real life, I would argue that a person who is effectively able to check every one of his opponent's attacks will have the advantage, all else being equal. If I check three hard low kicks I expect your leg is going to hurt more than mine, but I wouldn't want my opponent in game to take (gray health) damage just by me blocking their lows - it's more interesting and skillful that I have to select and apply an appropriate punish rather than damage just being awarded.
It’s a damn shame, you hate to sound like an old man yelling at a cloud but this shit really didn’t start until the social media generation, not to this level
You take their opinion in mind but form your own? Like you should with any opinionated thing in life? The game very well might not be appealing to legacy competitive Tekken players, why should that affect your decision to try it out the competitive aspect of Tekken? You might like what they don’t like about it. 

I wouldn’t had played or experienced half the things in life that I enjoy a lot of if I listened to people who said it wasn’t good or fun. It’s absolutely ridiculous that people let others dictate their thoughts and opinions so much these days. 

It’s okay to like what everyone doesn’t and it’s okay to not like what everyone does.
    That's fine for people already playing the game.  The point is more that nobody new is going to try it if all they hear from the recognized figures in the game's community is "this game sucks!"  Your time is limited and most people are going to try things because they heard other people like them, not because they heard people say they suck
        How many casuals even know about Knee and Arslan? I mean T7 sold like 10M~11M copies. Like the most viewed T7 vid is the Arslan vs Knee at 2.2M views after 4 years even if we assume twice as many people will see their tweets that would still be less than half all the people who ever played T7 knowing about them.
    there is an infinate number of things to do in your free time. i could practace tekken 8 or i could detail my car. if the people why play it the most say its bad why would i even waste my time?
If you ignore the flaws of something because you're afraid of it failing, they have no incentive to fix the flaws.

Namco knows what'd happen. If they deserve to be in their position, they'd make changes to stop it happening.
Tekken isn’t trying to get traction. It already has traction. It is widely considered the most complicated and competitive fighting game.
    T8 is like...lightyears far from a competitive game.
        That’s complete bs and you know nothing about competitive games then.
            Haha sure:), when movement doesnt work, when throws are tracking and unbreakable on ch, when you skip neutral with so many brainless easy tools, when you force 5050 with no risk etc. Youre living in the past where tekken WAS kinda competitive, youre like those who atill calling Shaheen a honest character, its T8 baby, the game where option select is part of the past.
                Just because Tekken 8 is more aggressive doesn’t mean it’s not competitive. And 50/50s always have a degree of risk because if you block the low you are almost always getting combo’s for 70+. You can reduce the amount of 50/50s with good movement. If you do 20 dmg to your opponent and they haven’t done any you can just stand back and force them to come to you. Movement doesn’t work? More like you don’t know how to move. Movement literally got buffed from T7. Homing throws are a bit annoying but you can also just duck. Tekken has always been a mixup oriented game. Most characters aren’t that brainless except for about 5 characters. The game has also been out for only 3 months. T7 had 2 years of balance tweaks before it arrived to console. If any changes need to seriously be made, we’ll see them after Japan EVO once the devs can see what current behavior is busted in competitive play. Especially if they see half the cast play Azu.
                    Yeah , i dont know how to move  yet eddy powercrush hit me on his back, and I blocked drag's wr2 when I was litteraly on his back , got hit by Ninas F1+2 when I was on her back and endless similar situations, movement is litteraly trash, and even more trash due to hitboxes being buffed ( the problem is the new hitboxes and not the movement probably). Also some 50/50 are 0 to none risk especially on heat. This game wants you to just throw bs overtuned moves like reinas 3+4,4,4 or victors u1+2 , those with other dozens of braindead "just throw" and hope for the best. Game is currently objectively shit on the competitive scense. Also heatsmashes , the vest just throw and hope for the best, has weird evasiveness and tracking, ghost range, free 5050 on block for snowball, if you manage to step some of them, gl punishing it due to forward momentum, way way too much reward for 0 risk. This game is a joke currently. Its fun though at least not against the top 8 characters.

P.s - dont forget that mr.Murray once said "why would you move when you can just block anf punish" this became real in this game with its casino unescapable 50/50 and random tracking of neutral killing moves like mishimas demon paws, dvj uf1 , lilis df3+4 etc... just random full screen tracking.
                        Must powercrushes are steppable. Drag’s WR2 is steppable. Reina’s 3+4,4,4 is annoying but is punishable with a 12f or can get rekt by a well timed mid. Expulsion is literally launch punishable, it just forces crouch so it’s got to be a WS combo. Some of the tracking in the game is a bit rough. Demon Paw is a good example. And aside from characters like Azu and Drag there is a fair amount of counterplay. People love to toss around the term casino but anyone with a strong kbd can force a fair amount of whiffs, or an armor can interrupt some 50/50s.
                            Powercrushes are steppable, but everything randomly tacking in this game. Wr2 is steppable too  but why did I block it when I was 180° to the actual diraction?3+4,4,4 -8 on blick and explusion -4 in heat(imo the dumbest buffed move rn, you litteraly have to block it cuz its tracking and full screen) basivclly punishing you for blocking, or even worse, eating a full combo damage from 1 move thats safe.  With all the randomness rng based bs that occures in this game its shit, also when you manage to sidestep a certain move or string the whiff punish may whiff for no reason , there are some consistant interactions, also random camera changes makes a df2 punish into db2 for example, this game is so far from being solid enough to start talking about competitive gameplay.
    7 was 8 not so much
Have fun having the balance of a game live rent free in your head. Try doing something else for a bit. It’s better for your health. Or just keep banging your head on your keyboard. Whatever.
    "Hey I like this franchise but don't like how they skewed it towards 50/50 mixups i hope they change it" GAMES RENT FREE IN UR HEAD LOSER GO TOUCH GRASS LOL. 

Just because someone has a different opinion to you doesn't mean they are raging and it consumes them lol
Yup, the more I think about it. This is likely to happen.  
You can never have too much money playing tekken as a career.
did lawyers tell you to write this?
    I think they're a lawyer themselves. Sounds awful lot like something that a lawyer, that doesn't want the common folk to know the extent of their power, would say.
    Did you write this because you were scared of a lawyer?
        The lawyers are on to us we gotta koreanbackdash out of here
            Oh no dude, you put me on p2 side!

They are capable of threatening someone who shared an opinion, and unless you can fight back, and spend time on it, its almost always better to retract. They know, they won't win in court, they don't need to take it to court.

Of course, I don't think Bamco's lawyers are involved here lol.
    They have nothing to threaten Knee with here...
        They're lawyers, they 100% know some yakuza dudes. Knee is probably held hostage and the bandai namco yakuza department wrote that tweet.
            You know what, I 100% believe you
        I'm not denying that, but don't tell me you've never come across a lawyer threatening a meaningless lawsuit around flimsy logic. My company had received a summons for piracy when they had zero proof we used their product. We were one of the few that could fight back, so we challenged them and put them in their place. But a lot of others settled because they had threatened a lot and asked for so less. 

Also, we were one of the few that didn't actually use their industry standard software.
            And you think it's a likely scenario that Bamco lawyers are going after Knee because he is a struggling member of the lower class who can't fight back?
                Bruh, Just saying lawyers can and will make issue if they are asked to do so. You want proof ? Just check out John Oliver's case. And no, Knee is not bigger than John Oliver. 

A random ass libel suite. One year later the case was dismissed. But guess what, his insurance went up, and damage was done. AND THIS WAS FOR A SEGMENT ON SLAPP LAWSUITS.

I'm not implying that there were any lawyers involved in this Knee statement lol. Bamco aren't stupid, nor do they have any reason to do so. However, if, and again, IF they did want to, you can bet that they can cause more than enough trouble for said person to retract their statements. Especially because said persons livelihood depends on being associated with their game.
                    And you think the John Oliver case, where he is talking about SLAPP lawsuits, is comparable to this situation where Knee is saying he doesn't like the Tekken metagame?
                        If you think a corporate lawyer cannot touch you, for an innocent statement like what Knee made, then you haven't met enough of these guy my man. That's all I'm saying. Most lawyers do what they do, to make your life hard, and have you submit. Nothing more than that, they don't even want to go to court.

Anyways, I'm not implying Bamco did anything here. And this pretty much useless discussion has run its course. Its naive you think you can't be sued for something you didn't do. You absolutely can, and a lot of times, even people as big and backed up as international celebrities are made to pay, on a case that has zero merits whatsoever. So unless you live in a state / country with good anti SLAPP laws or some version of it, you're fully liable to be bullied. Its a hard fact to accept, but it goes on every single day around the world.
                            I am not saying people don't get frivolous lawsuits. I am saying the threat of a frivolous lawsuit is not there in this situation. There is nothing to work with.
I think he's not quite used to his personal opinion having so much influence, especially on a global scale with social media. So good on him that he's beginning to recognize it.
    That might be it too.
People were using his (and other pros) opinions as ammunition to shit on the game. Shitting on the game relentlessly does nothing but hurt the game. Critisize, for sure, but if all you're doing is shouting from the rooftops about how fucking shit Tekken is and it's never going to be fixed, it's going to turn people away from coming into the game and that is a BAD thing long term.

It's just stupid you can't say anything positive about the game or be hopeful without being labelled a dickrider or shill for Bandai/Harada. It's like man, I know the game has problems but I still enjoy it and think it can be amazing.
    I feel the same.  It's like opinions have to be definitive instead of fluid.  I don't think that's what Knee was doing but people used his post as you said for ammo.  It's never the game needs some tuning and it will get better.  It seems to always be the game is broken and Namco has no ability to make adjustments.
    It's definitely not shit. It's just severely unbalanced right now and favors rushdown characters too much. But that's nothing that can't be fixed. That the game is crammed with a cynical business model and lazy content is a different issue, however...
        It's also pit a bad taste in people's mouth by having 3 different types of monetisation post launch with no notice. Their is a distrust, and rightfully so.
    To be fair people spent money on this game and don't have to be happy about anything.  So people have the right to be drama queens about this, especially with what happened with MK1 and Now T8 is running into some of the same issues and all this was after SF6 came out that they should've learned from.
        No being a shithead is just being a shithead whether you paid for it know doesn't justify the constant. Oh, this game is shit I'm right your wrong, oh knee said something negative see I was right.

It's all dumb, criticise don't bitch
I don't know when this community became nothing but bitching but God its exhausting.

Those things ruin the community as well, it makes people not want to engage with the community.
Every one bitching about every character makes people not want to play x character.

This community needs to take a breath and decide if they want the game to get better or just fail because right now it feels like a lot of people just want to see it fail which to me if you like tekken is weird.
            Being a shithead is being a shithead, and being a unfun game is being an unfun game.  I'd always rather people speak on how they feel than just pretend to like something.  That's how we end up with mediocre games.   I don't see anyone saying they want the game to fail, that's not even the conversation right now.  

  
The only people I see wanting it to fail are those who pretty much got played with the sneaky battle pass they added after the game is out like capcom did.  IN that they have every right to be angry.
    Exactly, and I think that may be why Knee posted this clarification. The dude absolutely loves Tekken, and the last thing he would want would be for people to use his comments to support their vehement and relentless trashing of the game. I swear it feels like some people here actually want the game to fail, and there's no way Knee would want to encourage or validate that kind of sentiment.
    Holy shit they get it! Crazy how this subreddit of all places seems to actively want it to fail......
Was especially funny considered that 99% of the players that felt validated by it are not even close to playing the same game as knee. His tekken is not your tekken. He is complaining about things most of these clowns dont even comprehend and they all just sitting their nodding their head because they just lost to someone spamming a duckable string on them 5 times in a row.
Remember that foreign language review that Harada called out for calling the game's DLC "P2W"? And the community got so angry that it was taken down and replace with a positive review?

Here we are 3 months later. 

The #1 character is DLC Eddie.

And a pro player who's primary language is not English is also having every word picked apart and analyzed with whatever context people want to apply to it.
Toxic positivity overtook the OW playerbase when 5v5 was announced and now Overwatch 2 is bleeding players at a faster rate than ever. People are so terrified of public opinion turning on their favorite game that they put their fingers in their ears and shout "LA LA LA I can't hear you!" when valid criticism comes up. The responses in the previous Knee thread weren't blind pessimism, everyone seemed to be pointing out specific issues and how they could be changed.

I haven't even played T8 due to injury so I have no clue whether the game is good or bad. I know from watching what happened to OW2 though that it's going to be bad for T8 long term if half the playerbase keeps trying to dismiss any criticism bc of the short-term effect it has on public perception.
    > I know from watching what happened to OW2 though that it's going to be bad for T8 long term if half the playerbase keeps trying to dismiss any criticism bc of the short-term effect it has on public perception.

on the flipside, it's going to be bad for T8 long term if people only see the community shitting on the game. which is what it currently looks like as someone who isn't super into tekken. i've seen one example of toxic positivity and about 400 posts saying that tekken 8 is a trash game that can't be redeemed
        Naw it'll be okay,  SF5 and T7 got crapped on a lot and were still okay in the long run.   Besides the hardcore don't really care so long as money is on the line, and casuals don't really care so long as what they have works.  That's the problem here, even for hardcore and casuals there's some real bad problems with the game.
Have you been on this sub in the last two months? Are you seriously going to claim it's overall positive on the game?
    There is a huge storage of copium over there, at that Justin Wong post. You might wanna check that out before discussing the curious nuances of the concept of "overall opinion", which you're clearly lacking
        Right, it hasn't been nothing but hating for months. Maybe look at the sub before you make claims about it.
The tweet.
It's the same text but rewritten.
    prove it
        you can't read?
            prove that he can't read
        Bro are you dense
            🗿
Cuz the best part of high level tekken ,even decent ranked player are the footsies and neutral play (pokes+movement pressure) its the exciting part imo ,also having good defense(movement which is way worse now) and punishment, it feels kinda extinct mostly.
I agree completely and the moment I got to purple ranks in Tekken 8 and was still being matched with super aggressive button mashers was really the moment that it hit me.

A fair chunk of these players in upper red/lower purple, they wouldn't have made it out of yellow/orange ranks in Tekken 7. More than once I have said out loud 'how are you even in this rank omg', while I'm fighting someone that refuses to stop pressing buttons. 

It's kinda sad to see really. I was hoping to be playing T8 off and on for quite a few years. Sadly it seems that this new iteration and direction is just not aimed at me.
Sold 11.8 million units but has a higher percentage player drop of rate in 3 months then Tekken 7? Is clear the intention was to make money with this game with cinematic easy to play mechanics then retain players long term. 

When the newbies who get better at the game become veteran players and are left with the core mechanics of thr game after a year or two they will see the issue to and see the layer of depth pulled from thr game because as you become higher level you want higher depth. It's what rewards you to keep going and get better. You can only steam roll someone soo much before it stops being fun.
    Yep, fully agreed.
In case you didn't notice, I was joking, I have no idea if they got money or not, neither you know or anyone else, but influencers (I believe we can call them like that) have impact big enough that it's in publisher business to take good care of them, right? Simple logic, if I could pay someone who is followed by many, I would pay because it's beneficial to me, so... we don't know, but somehow both top players change their mind, IDK man, weird coincidence ;)
It's all counter striking as opposed to just blocking

An actual reason to not like the game is that they simply just gave some dudes incredibly good tools and not others so like many fighting games you just see the same dudes over and over.  Even then though, the usage data has a better spread then a lot of games

Then there is the scummy monetization which is actually pretty fucking stupid
jins d2 is a prime example of what im talking about
     it’s the only example unless u can name another low that is ch launchsble and is -12
Cause everyone isn’t a knowledgeable player.
    He said worse and worse going into purple ranks. I find that hard to believe.
        purple ranks are dogshit at the gaem 

rank inflation is super high in that gaem, purple ranks in t8 are like yellow ranks in t7
        Considering the spike in new players Tekken 8, the rampant plugging problem that only recently started becoming more manageable, and possibly a third problem I’m not aware of. It’s not impossible for it to be a problem of lacking knowledge.
            There's no way button mashers survive the red ranks. They can probably reach red but that won't last long.
                Just depends on how smart they are with button mashing. Most characters can kill in two launches/ combos.
                    But if they're being smart, that's no longer mashing. They're understanding the game now.
                        Hmm yes and no. I know what you mean as it is playing smarter but there’s still mashing in how it’s performed. Like with how Eddie is on his debut. Tons of people winning off of lack of knowledge and mashing a single button. When people say button mashing they don’t always mean random inputs. They just means a constant string of inputs.
                            But if they still act when it's not their turn, they get punished. Like I said, there's no way mashers survive red, moreso purple.
Yeah ive made it to purples with a pretty defensive playstyle, i havent really bothered learning setups or abusing my plus frames and optimizing combos yet.
I will soon and see how it changes things but i want to keep climbing until i plataeu then work on those things. But ducking high strings and launching dumb shit and whiff punishing as gotten me pretty far on its own.
    Exactly. If you’re a bit patient in this game you can benefit from the stupidly potent offensive options.
        Part of the problem is your offense has to be just as good as your defense. Or your defense has to be leagues better to compensate now is how it feels to me. I tried playing defensively, and I still "try". But with all the bullshit going on, and just how much quicker people feel in next gen fighting games (maybe I'm just getting old) I find myself quickly saying "if I try to block and punish and lose the interaction TWICE I'm cooked. My best shot is to throw out my fastest/most unexpected combos." I feel as if I'd have to put 300 hours of defensive practice in against each character just to learn 1/3rd of the options I'd have to react to and feel any degree of comfort while on defense
            Yeah that makes sense. I don’t think you even need to know the opposing character to any significant degree and react to every single move they throw with the perfect counter, but at a minimum if you can recognize when it’s not your turn because of a frame disadvantage for example that’s already a huge plus. I think a combination of safe moves leading to launchers, CHs, etc. is pretty effective.
                Duly noted. Will keep add this to my notes and keep it in mind while practicing. Also want to add that I usually feel like I'm pretty decent at reading breaks and pauses and finding the right time to poke in and interrupt or punish. Just the more time I've spent on tekken the more I've realized I'm not that good at it. I get *really* messed up by players like Jun or a GOOD Zafina that either has natural fake pauses in their combos or is good at leaving enough time to make you think there's enough time to interrupt only to get CH Launched
I have to disagree. Currently at Tekken King rank and man if it aint a huge mashfest. defense isnt really important to be honest, just dont mash when its heavily the opponents turn and sadly youre good to go. so many stances have insane evasion, kenpo is absurd (and the fact that they gave it to more characters, ugh.) all you gotta do is just rush your opponent down with insane plus frames, oh its finally your turn? No its not, heat burst. Chip damage is ridiculous. Defense doesnt work because one of the million forced 50/50s is eventually going to get you since theres practically no counterplay to many of them. im super frustrated so sorry if it sounds like im being a crybaby but this is just how i feel.
    I’m at King too and I don’t see the mash fest to be honest. Maybe we have different definitions of mashing lol. When I was lower ranked yeah I could see dudes just spamming all kinds of BS but here there is some calculation involved and timing when to do shit, generally speaking. 

I think where you said don’t mash when it’s heavily the opponents turn is key. That’s in effect defending. It’s a simple concept but a lot of people suck at doing that. So my point wasn’t that you should play defensively in general but that it’s extremely important to know when to block and when to attack especially in a Tekken where blindly throwing out moves can result in you losing half your life.
        You're playing King, bro lmao nobody will be mashing, no one wants to take a low ch that deals 50 damage or or a ch throw and then you die or heat smash that deals 60 damage.
             tekken king rank, not king the character
                Ah then my apologies, mate
                For real though, is the guy blind? Cant he see you re a Gon main?
                    That elite 2 foot hit box!
I agree, was stuck in reds but I realized that I have to block more. The more defense I incorporated in my game, the more success I got in my matches, esp the most annoying match-ups.
    Yeah and the great thing about simply blocking is that it gives you a chance to see how your opponent likes to play and then react accordingly.
The pros are complaining that defense is unrewarding in this game, which is literally the exact same complaint as the one I have. You're right, I might get caught off guard by a snake edge once, as I don't really expect people to use them in purple ranks. Don't know what a "W2" is, maybe you're referring WR2 which I find rather easy to sidestep.


I wish my frustrations were a skill issue since I enjoy learning and finding solutions to problems, but I feel like the solution to most challenges currently in the game is just being more relentless in your aggression than your opponent, which doesn't really take a lot of skill imo (and the pros seem to agree)
    You do not have fundamental defensive skills remotely good enough to judge how rewarding defense is in this game. 

Offense is stronger than defense in every game at lower levels because defense is inherently harder to learn. 

You don't know if defense is unrewarding in tekken 8. You are just trash. And so am I
        Ok, but most of the pros are saying that defense is unrewarding in T8. Are they just trash too?
            Ppl are just trying to tell you that in your couple months timespan with the game, your defence is more than likely still pretty weak so you cant really grasp how good defence is not rewarding. 


If you were playing T7 u d still get blown up by opponent offense bc defence is harder to learn than offense in any game. But good defence can be learnt eventually, however its less rewarding in T8.
    You don’t “get” it
        And the pros don't get it either I'm guessing?
            Nah they get it,you don’t
Yeah but the game was super well received. Reviews were great, this sub was booming with cool stuff until the shop showed up. That was the beginning of the end. All the good credit they earned was lost and now that's the reason the negativity is overwhelming. The game is still the same base game but it's tainted with all this other stuff now.
    No, the negativity was alive and well for a number of reasons, netcode, performance, plugging, just lots of random issues. 

Then the team doubling down on the ban list etc. 

The good faith was lost. Then as people figured out the game it became more and more obvious how oppressive offense is and how defensive expression is limited. “Why sidestep when you can block”

The game is dope, but the straws have been stacking up on the camels back, it’s not just one thing.

The mxts just put them on blast, all the other negative stuff was more of a critique of the hardcore crowds.
        Yeah but not at launch. It was well received. The issue started when plugging was rampant and they did nothing about it BUT they released a shop. The shop came out a month after launch so we had a decent run. That just solidified that they don't really care about us or the game, they just want our money. That was basically the beginning of the end.
            The game had critiques from the get go. The general media is the only outlet that has changed the narrative. 

It’s not hard to google people talking about all these same problems the first month. We just had a lot of hope and good faith.

Now the game has been out, many flaws that are obvious have been poorly handled, and the mxt stuff just made it all look way worse. 

I agree the game was well received from a broad brush perspective, but at the core, the gameplay issues have been talked about since beta.

*I still think it’s a good ass game and I think most people do, the negativity is because it’s not what it could be*
Big time. Steam charts show the playerbase plummeting. Expected for a fighting game since it's a niche market BUT it's trending to be less than what T7 was. That's not a good sign. Less players means they're going to up the microtransactions to compensate. It's a domino effect.
    I just responded to this in another thread, but that's not true. Both games have nearly idnetifcal three month trends, both splayerbases shrinking by the same percentage (around 35% per month). The big difference is T8 started with 40k and T7 started with around 12k.
        Interesting. I guess we need a larger sample size. Might spike after EVO if it's hype, that generally brings in new players.
Literally. We were all shitting on MK when T8 released because we were the new kings of the FGC. Then we started getting slapped around with microtransactions and pros crying that the game is unfair because they're losing too much. Been a wild 3 months.
    Crazy how it's only been three months. It's been a rollercoaster already
        Yeah, I don't think this is good for the longevity of the game. T7 overall was pretty smooth until the busted DLCs showed up but that was years after the launch.
            It's true though that when T7 got released, it had technically already been out for a few years to become smooth.

I think a lot will depend on how the tournaments will turn out and how they are received. Can we get anything as hype as T7 tournaments in this game? Hard to say with how volatile the gameplay is. The methodical style of T7 might have its flaws but it made close games much more intense to watch because they lasted longer
                As boring as the overly defensive gameplay was, it actually helped build a lot of tension knowing that something still had to give and the fight would begin in earnest. T8 has virtually none of that suspense and feels more like a Wild West quick-draw showdown.
                Evo is going to be a big test for this games tournament scene. If it's well received the game will keep growing. If not we're in trouble.
    As a new player who still doesn't care too much about franchise although I REALLY do enjoy Tekken 8.

I can only imagine the cries of the players if they would deliver Tekken 9 as a fullgame. 1 balance patch and that's it. Even less skins than now. Go the MK route. And then also deliver

No mtx. No dlc's. No updates for 5 years. Pretty sure this would make ppl quit even faster lol
        T7 survived for almost ten years and the only content we got were characters. That game was great. They abandoned it towards the end to focus on T8 but it was still super active.

I don't think this game will have the same life span or sales.
            I was a nolife gamer for the years where T7 was out and I didn't even know the game existed or had any playerbase

For the most part from what I see Tekken had around 4k active players even in 2016 XD

Yea survived is a good phrase. All I see is current community making sure T8 won't be bought by potentially interested new players for the next 4years
                T7 was a game made with a budget of 3 happy meals and 0 marketing after a failed last game. T8 is coming in with massive marketing and budget +goodwill of the people that it built up in T7 and is looking to end up in the same or worse place than T7 was.
Yeah this sub has devolved into a mess. When the game first game out it was great, super exciting. The constant plugging and now all these trash shop items has pretty much ruined that vibe.
You gotta just wait a little longer eventually this sub will be purified and it will be more of the tips and strategies you're looking for and a lot more Waifu fan art posts.   I expect the May patch to drop overreactions on both sides then we get back to talking about actually playing the game and not arm chair devs.
No because they don't cater Tekken to pros. The money is with casuals.
    Yeah, I guess so. That's why the game has mixed reviews on steam
        People have been review bombing the game ever since the Micro transactions got announced it has nothing to do with the actual game
            mtx is in the game though so it literally does have things to do with the game. And wtf is this review bombing shit, you think you can convince thousands of people to do what they dot want to do? if the mtx wasn't a problem people wouldn't be reviewing it badly, review bombing doesn't exist especially when you have to buy the game.
        Which sucks because I think the game is really fun just needs some tweaks and less MTXs.
            Yeah :/ I've kind of dropped the game at this point. Maybe I'll try again after Evo japan, or one of my characters gets announced.
                Sorry bro :(
There's a big difference between random reddit monsters and the pro known far as wide as (probably) the best Tekken player ever. Knee has a huge following and influence. It's worth it for people with influence considering how they talk and express their opinions, given they have an outsized impact on the community.
For the sake of allowing positivity to still exist in the community. Overwhelming negativity discouraged those that have positive things to say from saying them. Nobody is forced to care about the state of the community they are in but their impact is undeniable
    Right, but you're just repeating yourself though.

Don't be negative because it pushes away positivity.  
Why does that matter?  
Because it pushes away positivity.

What is the actual benefit to those wanting a better game? Like, sure, shut up so redditor 136794 can post their cosplay, but how is that actually doing anything worth justifying shutting down discourse?
        Only speak positive, comrade
        If the people in the community aren’t comfortable talking about what makes the game good then you can’t expect to have an honest conversation about the state of the game.
            Then just talk about it though? Why is the presence of some people being negative bad for discussions, while you specifically wanting to disallow people from vocalizing in specific ways healthy?

Either have the discussion or don't, but you can't expect to police how people express themselves when that's exactly what's needed to gauge the state of the game's reception. Both ways.
                Ideally people aren’t affected by other peoples opinions and so whatever ratio of positivity to negativity is how the audience actually feels. In reality whenever the initial reaction to something is extremely negative most people that would have something positive to say, will not want to do so. I’m not acting like this is something that people are willing to fix themselves, i’m just pointing out what’s happening
                    Fair enough, not trying to dismiss the validity of newcomers possibly being pushed away. However, having everyone misrepresent their own opinions to match some sort of acceptable range (so long as it's not actual bullying or spreading hate of course) is no more acceptable of a solution than telling more positive minded users to refrain from praising any element until the smoke clears.

With the key point being that positivity only rewards the current state of the game and encourages devs in what many believe to be very incorrect decisions, and just straight up manipulation in some sense, then you're artificially pushing aside negativity that needs to be heard as well. And it's that kind of behavior that causes us to end up with lower quality products, MTX, etc.

Absolutely be positive if you want, praise the elements you like, and I recommend everyone do so, but not to the point where it becomes a toxic positivity circlejerk purely because "that's better than being negative".
        Welcome to the vibes era

Meaningful discourse isnt meant for casuals, just vibes
        I think the intention was to highlight that being more specific with criticism and less doom posting might make the community and the game better. But I can read minds over the internet.
Well yes we self censor ourselves all the time. Do you walk around telling everyone your opinion about things or them exactly you feel them? Probably not because you thought about what effect that would have on your relationship with them and other people. And like I stated, I am not saying you have an obligation to care about this, but that the effect is obvious.
Damn. I've never even played Tekken 5. I haven't jumped on 8 yet due to all the drama. Will continue to wait a bit.
I’ve seen them. Uh duh the crowd that’s there is gonna be hype they’re there supporting there favorites.  I also remember nothing but Leroy’s and everyone crying into metaphorical megaphones about that too.
Nah that's bs. At the start yes, people were hype about the slowmos etc. But the game had several bs patches like when literally everyone was playing leroy and I also remember CONSTANT crying about how 2ds ruin the game. And thousands of sleepyfaces in twitch chat when it was just players backdashing on infinite stages. 

The offline crowd at events is always going to be hype. They are right there. Ofc theyll cheer. Wont be any different for T8 although the crowd will be bigger.
It will but it’s riot. Riot while money hungry, knows how to keep a game competitive and fun enough to retain massive amounts of players just because it’s riot.
Do we really need to cover this again? Rage art is borderline useless if you’re fighting someone not garbage. In combos it’s scaled heavily. And not in combos easily readable and avoidable. Rage art is at the very bottom of issues with the game. T7 also had that so…you’re just saying shit. And you can’t “spam” a move you get one time per round lmao. Warrior opinion.
    idky y’all be acting like top player’s don’t use rage art. rage art + heat smash is cancer.
        It’s really not and you’re not even on topic anymore. It was in t7. Heat smash is harder to deal with sure. Still not game breaking. Oh no you get 50/50d just like in every other tekken game or fighting game 🥴🥴🥴
            well in my opinion it is. heat smash + rage art + power crush heat engagers are cancer. idc what u talkin bout. ur obviously some loser ass nigga who thinks his opinion matters cuz he slightly decent at tekken.
                Lmao you’re such a pussy and that’s evident. Why would anyone care about what someone who is just a whiner and garbage have to say anyway? Your opinion is just stupid. You can’t even speak  your some broke ass uneducated actual loser in everything you do, don’t be mad at me for it
                    bruh stop all that yappin lol u claim ur life better than mine so lets prove it. all i said was u being good at tekken was irrelevant to life and you starting goin off on a tangent. must be insecure about some things lol.
                        Nah you came up in here on my shit first. If you could read, you’d have noticed I said FROM and then elaborated that I’m from, not IN, meaning I live somewhere else, Baltimore. I see the education quality hasn’t changed there at all. Sad. You’re just another wanna be dime a dozen tough dude when you start realizing you’re saying stupid shit “come and see irl” LMAO anybody saying that shit isn’t scary, can’t fight, and ain’t shit. You’re the insecure one and that’s exactly why you resort to such a stupid thing to say.
                            But super congrats on being the dumbest fuck I’ve ever seen in this sub. Don’t get shot in Baltimore trying to be what you ain’t 🤷‍♀️
                            bro i said stop all that yappin either prove u on sum or just shut ur monkey mouth. I’m not from baltimore #1 and if you can’t understand what i’m saying that shows how ignorant you are, not me. so once again, stop yappin, you said your life better than mine lets prove it. We in the same area 🤔
    There are legit criticisms but “wahhh wage art” isn’t one of them.
        that’s your opinion. acting like your some top player and you can dictate what people have issue with doesn’t help anything 🤣
            Im not dictating what you have an issue with I’m saying it’s not a legitimate issue. You’re just a scrub.
                bro idc what u think i am, u being good at tekken means absolutely nothing in life lol.
                    Ah my point. We’re talking about tekken tho so…”hehe you’re good at game but not life” typical last resort when you’re losing an argument. Time to log off scrub. My life is still better than yours too so 🤷‍♀️
                        idc about your point lol you called me a scrub, so im telling you. you being good at a video is irrelevant to the grand scheme of life. 😂 and if u from baltimore we can link up and see who life really better 🤔
                            From and living in are different things buddy. You ain’t scary pussy
Yes, the coolest part that turn tekken 7 into Tower Defense.

Kill it and the game become better, no more walling game.
    You used backdash to create whiffs... that's the whole point
        KBD is an exploit, it is not a mechanic, the reason they made backdash nerfed is literally because they aren't meant to be like that
        Backdash is a thing

korean backdash is another thing

Whats the matter to play a FIGHT GAME that players go running back back back?

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFTBLQZ-Cis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFTBLQZ-Cis)

Killing it make much better to game system.

        I'm misspelling some words on purpose. At first its cause I was lazy and did not know how to spell "probably" right and always spelled probly, but now I'm doing it on purpose cause chat bots and ai don't do stuff like that and I think it's just more fun, although I still use proper grammer for essays and stuff
            You did that last one on purpose, didn’t you?
Arsenal. Oscar Kazama. Hello amigos.
I could have googled but was too lazy.  Lol :)
I am super ADHD, so details like this often escape me.  I have a vague enough idea of their name to recognize it if I see it, but not enough to spell it.
True. Arsenal had a very rough couple of days, but im not sure if knee would fare better against Bayern. Tho his defensive style may be difficult to crack.
Ok now I know the meaning, but from where this comes from, based? Like based on something?
    [https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/based](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/based)
        I’m glad Lil B gets his flowers on this because he literally came up with the slang and now people don’t even realize how strongly it’s associated with him
            Lil B had waaay more influence than people will ever give him credit for lol
                ya ill contribute to this tangent. i love that man. real ones know
            Yeah man he's from Berkeley/Oakland. I remember my friend Natasha now known as Kreayshawn used to shoot videos for Lil B. She began a music career when she saw how easy it was to do music videos and go viral
    Idk the origin really and as far as i know it's not really used in a "based on this.." way. It's actually kind of a running meme that ppl reply "based on what?" When they don't understand how or why the word is being used that way. Sorry if this explanation is lacking.
        Nah you're good, thank you.
    based on your mom lmao gottem
    Literally just means that the person is standing on a strong ideological base and that they aren't likely to be pushed off of it because it is strong. Overwhelmingly used as a compliment, although it is possible to be based on a flawed foundation.
It also goes the other way I doubt he wants people to use his opinion to validate shitting on the game because they're hardstuck red.

Which is what a lot of people are doing, a lot of complaints pros make are specific to that level of tekken and for them it's also their job.

I literally saw someone saying nothing should be faster than a 10f jab that breaks the rules of tekken then they complain that flash is a 9 frame start up that robs their turn.
As if yoshis flash hasn't been around since tekken 3

I'm all for criticising the game but it's just a tiring seeing people rush to shit on it as it is to defend it
\*record scratches\*

Wait, why do I remember hearing/reading you wouldn't get chip unless it was heat? Did I just lose to translation? Chip damage happens outside of heat? 

If this just grey health system? 

Ooof, maybe 1 too many systems in place.
    You take chip damage "grey health" when you block attacks. You regen grey health when you attack whether its blocked or it hits. Engaging heat heals all your grey health. You lose when all your red health is gone, though you can't be chipped to death.

When tekken 8 was announced and the new systems talked about. I thought chip only happened while in heat. But thats not true. Which seems weird.
    Not all moves add chip damage.  But those that do give chip damage in heat or not.  (Damage goes up in heat though)
I really like the drive gauge in sf6. It’s powerful but if you go too ham burnout can be really punishing.
Some moves have innate chip properties like Asuka's ff1+2 and running 1+2 for example. As for the heat chip damage debate i am all for it since you gain back that health by attacking. It is a mechanic  meant to punish turtiling up which alot of intermediate and beginner players often do. Now i will agree that the amount of chip damage should be lowered a bit as well as overall damage in some areas.
    I mean...are you sure that beginner and intermediate players are the ones who do the turtling? I would much rather say that advanced and pro players tend to turtle way more and beginners and intermediates tend to learn strings and flowcharts and spam them all the time.
        Its about 50/50 in my experience. Its not that beginners are blocking everything it just that i noticed that some tend to slowly back walk away instead of trying to attack. As in i would do a clearly unsafe option and they just back walk and avoid interaction. I dont know how beginner Jins ive played that just back walk and the moment i go for an interaction demon paw or Bryan u4. Now it could just be my luck or region but about 85% of my online matches are overly defensive players both beginner and intermediate, 5% intermediate/advanced spammers, and the rest are a mixed grab bag of players who kinda what they are doing.
            I have a totally different experience, honestly. Beginners are overly aggressive and tend to mash even when they're heavily under frames or they throw the most unsafe but flashy move. Intermediates tend to keep the distance and approach with safe moves like Jin's ff2 because it is actually a more "thought through" way to play the game. Advanced and pro players usually pick you apart with movement usually using only ultra-safe strings and pokes.
at least chip cant kill you. i know the situation you're talking about, though. 

In MK11 you could get heroic chip out, which is just a fancy way of saying you died to a safe block strong with 0 counter play.
I mean Victor's Explosion is -17 on block or something like that, so even if you take chip damage you can get that health right back simply by punishing that same Explosion which is an unsafe move.
    not in heat it's not, it's safe during heat
Juggles and OTGs leave recoverable health. Its really not that complicated lol
    Idk if I can give you "it's not that complicated"
What rank are you hon?
    I'll go ahead and post the anonymous tekken player bitching flow chart

1\. "I'm GoD"

"No you're not you're lying"

2\. "I'm TGS"

"Wow not even GoD? I am, don't talk to me"

3\. "Any other rank"

"I'm (your rank+3), scrub"

regardless you're a scrub with a bitchmade mentality
        Thank you for the meltdown, we all enjoy a good laugh 😂😂
            That was a pretty wild ride, wasn't it? Lol. 

  
I hope he doesn't delete the comment chain, that was a hell of a train wreck.
            Stay scrubby
                Stay obese and miserable
                    project harder
                        Why do you talk like an incel?
Can you explain to me the frames on heat engagers? +17 should mean that i have a 17 frame move guaranteed after no? But its not like that right? Nothing is guaranteed after i do a heat engager?
    The opponent is in a forced block for 17 frames. They can't do anything but block.
    Like people have said, the opponent can still block and duck during those 17 frames. This kind of frame advantage is sometimes labeled as +17g where g I think stands for "guard" and many situations in the game have this, like Kazuya's df1,4 being +17g or something on hit and his db4 doing similar on counter hit, as opposed to Jin's 4 being a true +13 on ch and granting him guaranteed followups
    sometimes things that are +10 or more will still allow the opponent to block, it just depends on the moves. Heat Engagers always allow the opponent to block. You are right in your assumption that +17 should mean a 17 frame or faster move would hit, but tekken is complicated so it doesn't work that way in some instances.
    For most characters, their fastest move is 10f.

Being +17 means they cannot do anything else than block for the first 17 frames you can move. That means any move that's 26 frames or less (which is very slow) is uninterruptable.
    It means you can act 17 frames before your opponent can. It doesn't mean they can't block.
eeeezzzz
Yeah I want it reduced even further
its funny cause its mostly the safe and plus moves that chip
You know why is the throw game so *weird*?? Like I get all the changes but they're incoherent.

I think making 1+2 break throws homing and all other throws *not homing* would be a cool move idk
When a top tier like Drag or Jun puts you into the grinder at the wall, and even if you guess their mixups right on block (you can punish almost nothing cause everything is +), but they dont mind cause they chipping away my hp quite fast. The game literally makes you spam and discourage any calculated defensive play.
Everything is + on block or safe? Lol, lmao even.
I mean let's play through this scenario. Your opponent uses + moves on you several times in a row and at no point are you interrupting him, he has conditioned you. Then you guess a 50/50 wrong, whatever that's supposed to be (does not remove your grey health usually). Then you fail to break a throw that your opponent threw out because he predicted you would sidestep or further turtle up. Is your opponent not supposed to win that round?
If you were a god at playing defensive Tekken, you should be able to sidestep/duck/low parry/interrupted at some point. Holding back and backdashing isn't good defensive Tekken. The issue is that there's some absurd moves in the game right now that track too well or are too plus where you don't have good options other than block. It's okay to be punished for blocking and rewarded for avoid attacks.
    This would be true if this game wouldnt be a 50/50 spam fest. You can learn strings and stuff but it all goes out of the window if you just have to guess.
    >implying the gods of defensive Tekken have been able to consistently sidestep/duck/low parry/interrupt things when it matters most to win them games. Except it doesn't.

Seems like you're missing the whole point. Strong defensive Tekken is not as well rewarded as it should be. Playing well in Tekken 8 is constantly attacking to run your game and making sure the other player isn't allowed to attack, or play the game. Blocking is important for other things aside from just deciding to turtle up and bait CHs.

"the issue is that there's some absurd moves in the game right now that track too well or are too plus where you don't have good options other than block"

So you agree with me. Offense is too oppressive and too punishing towards defensive players. You're being punished for blocking not because of chip damage, but because you're forced to constantly take mixups and are put into disadvantageous situations where you're just blocking. Not turtling, not trying to run out the clock. Just. Blocking.

That's the problem.
I don’t know if you understand, but what makes real world fights engaging to watch (mma) is seeing you wither down a defending opponent, obviously not everything is going to be realistic, but the idea that you can’t just put your guard up forever is what creates engagement, that’s why when people watch muay thai, or boxing, they’re interested in how much damage someone incurred through leg kick checks or blocking punches. I think chip is necessary, but dodges should be more powerful.
    I actually really enjoy combat sports (mostly MMA but also some boxing), so I appreciate what you're saying, in that there's a rich combination of factors that make analyzing a fight enjoyable.

What I would offer you is that a fighter breaking down their opponent's defense is usually achieved by how effectively they can bypass the opponent's guard - going for the body, kicking the legs. You usually have to hit your opponent somewhere other than his guard in order to make your exertion worth it. In Tekken this is simulated by fast pokes that are easy to land but do just a little damage.

In real life, I would argue that a person who is effectively able to check every one of his opponent's attacks will have the advantage, all else being equal. If I check three hard low kicks I expect your leg is going to hurt more than mine, but I wouldn't want my opponent in game to take (gray health) damage just by me blocking their lows - it's more interesting and skillful that I have to select and apply an appropriate punish rather than damage just being awarded.
That's fine for people already playing the game.  The point is more that nobody new is going to try it if all they hear from the recognized figures in the game's community is "this game sucks!"  Your time is limited and most people are going to try things because they heard other people like them, not because they heard people say they suck
    How many casuals even know about Knee and Arslan? I mean T7 sold like 10M~11M copies. Like the most viewed T7 vid is the Arslan vs Knee at 2.2M views after 4 years even if we assume twice as many people will see their tweets that would still be less than half all the people who ever played T7 knowing about them.
there is an infinate number of things to do in your free time. i could practace tekken 8 or i could detail my car. if the people why play it the most say its bad why would i even waste my time?
T8 is like...lightyears far from a competitive game.
    That’s complete bs and you know nothing about competitive games then.
        Haha sure:), when movement doesnt work, when throws are tracking and unbreakable on ch, when you skip neutral with so many brainless easy tools, when you force 5050 with no risk etc. Youre living in the past where tekken WAS kinda competitive, youre like those who atill calling Shaheen a honest character, its T8 baby, the game where option select is part of the past.
            Just because Tekken 8 is more aggressive doesn’t mean it’s not competitive. And 50/50s always have a degree of risk because if you block the low you are almost always getting combo’s for 70+. You can reduce the amount of 50/50s with good movement. If you do 20 dmg to your opponent and they haven’t done any you can just stand back and force them to come to you. Movement doesn’t work? More like you don’t know how to move. Movement literally got buffed from T7. Homing throws are a bit annoying but you can also just duck. Tekken has always been a mixup oriented game. Most characters aren’t that brainless except for about 5 characters. The game has also been out for only 3 months. T7 had 2 years of balance tweaks before it arrived to console. If any changes need to seriously be made, we’ll see them after Japan EVO once the devs can see what current behavior is busted in competitive play. Especially if they see half the cast play Azu.
                Yeah , i dont know how to move  yet eddy powercrush hit me on his back, and I blocked drag's wr2 when I was litteraly on his back , got hit by Ninas F1+2 when I was on her back and endless similar situations, movement is litteraly trash, and even more trash due to hitboxes being buffed ( the problem is the new hitboxes and not the movement probably). Also some 50/50 are 0 to none risk especially on heat. This game wants you to just throw bs overtuned moves like reinas 3+4,4,4 or victors u1+2 , those with other dozens of braindead "just throw" and hope for the best. Game is currently objectively shit on the competitive scense. Also heatsmashes , the vest just throw and hope for the best, has weird evasiveness and tracking, ghost range, free 5050 on block for snowball, if you manage to step some of them, gl punishing it due to forward momentum, way way too much reward for 0 risk. This game is a joke currently. Its fun though at least not against the top 8 characters.

P.s - dont forget that mr.Murray once said "why would you move when you can just block anf punish" this became real in this game with its casino unescapable 50/50 and random tracking of neutral killing moves like mishimas demon paws, dvj uf1 , lilis df3+4 etc... just random full screen tracking.
                    Must powercrushes are steppable. Drag’s WR2 is steppable. Reina’s 3+4,4,4 is annoying but is punishable with a 12f or can get rekt by a well timed mid. Expulsion is literally launch punishable, it just forces crouch so it’s got to be a WS combo. Some of the tracking in the game is a bit rough. Demon Paw is a good example. And aside from characters like Azu and Drag there is a fair amount of counterplay. People love to toss around the term casino but anyone with a strong kbd can force a fair amount of whiffs, or an armor can interrupt some 50/50s.
                        Powercrushes are steppable, but everything randomly tacking in this game. Wr2 is steppable too  but why did I block it when I was 180° to the actual diraction?3+4,4,4 -8 on blick and explusion -4 in heat(imo the dumbest buffed move rn, you litteraly have to block it cuz its tracking and full screen) basivclly punishing you for blocking, or even worse, eating a full combo damage from 1 move thats safe.  With all the randomness rng based bs that occures in this game its shit, also when you manage to sidestep a certain move or string the whiff punish may whiff for no reason , there are some consistant interactions, also random camera changes makes a df2 punish into db2 for example, this game is so far from being solid enough to start talking about competitive gameplay.
7 was 8 not so much
"Hey I like this franchise but don't like how they skewed it towards 50/50 mixups i hope they change it" GAMES RENT FREE IN UR HEAD LOSER GO TOUCH GRASS LOL. 

Just because someone has a different opinion to you doesn't mean they are raging and it consumes them lol
I think they're a lawyer themselves. Sounds awful lot like something that a lawyer, that doesn't want the common folk to know the extent of their power, would say.
Did you write this because you were scared of a lawyer?
    The lawyers are on to us we gotta koreanbackdash out of here
        Oh no dude, you put me on p2 side! 

wavuwavuwavuwavuwavu
They have nothing to threaten Knee with here...
    They're lawyers, they 100% know some yakuza dudes. Knee is probably held hostage and the bandai namco yakuza department wrote that tweet.
        You know what, I 100% believe you
    I'm not denying that, but don't tell me you've never come across a lawyer threatening a meaningless lawsuit around flimsy logic. My company had received a summons for piracy when they had zero proof we used their product. We were one of the few that could fight back, so we challenged them and put them in their place. But a lot of others settled because they had threatened a lot and asked for so less. 

Also, we were one of the few that didn't actually use their industry standard software.
        And you think it's a likely scenario that Bamco lawyers are going after Knee because he is a struggling member of the lower class who can't fight back?
            Bruh, Just saying lawyers can and will make issue if they are asked to do so. You want proof ? Just check out John Oliver's case. And no, Knee is not bigger than John Oliver. 

A random ass libel suite. One year later the case was dismissed. But guess what, his insurance went up, and damage was done. AND THIS WAS FOR A SEGMENT ON SLAPP LAWSUITS.

I'm not implying that there were any lawyers involved in this Knee statement lol. Bamco aren't stupid, nor do they have any reason to do so. However, if, and again, IF they did want to, you can bet that they can cause more than enough trouble for said person to retract their statements. Especially because said persons livelihood depends on being associated with their game.
                And you think the John Oliver case, where he is talking about SLAPP lawsuits, is comparable to this situation where Knee is saying he doesn't like the Tekken metagame?
                    If you think a corporate lawyer cannot touch you, for an innocent statement like what Knee made, then you haven't met enough of these guy my man. That's all I'm saying. Most lawyers do what they do, to make your life hard, and have you submit. Nothing more than that, they don't even want to go to court.

Anyways, I'm not implying Bamco did anything here. And this pretty much useless discussion has run its course. Its naive you think you can't be sued for something you didn't do. You absolutely can, and a lot of times, even people as big and backed up as international celebrities are made to pay, on a case that has zero merits whatsoever. So unless you live in a state / country with good anti SLAPP laws or some version of it, you're fully liable to be bullied. Its a hard fact to accept, but it goes on every single day around the world.
                        I am not saying people don't get frivolous lawsuits. I am saying the threat of a frivolous lawsuit is not there in this situation. There is nothing to work with.
That might be it too.
I feel the same.  It's like opinions have to be definitive instead of fluid.  I don't think that's what Knee was doing but people used his post as you said for ammo.  It's never the game needs some tuning and it will get better.  It seems to always be the game is broken and Namco has no ability to make adjustments.
It's definitely not shit. It's just severely unbalanced right now and favors rushdown characters too much. But that's nothing that can't be fixed. That the game is crammed with a cynical business model and lazy content is a different issue, however...
    It's also pit a bad taste in people's mouth by having 3 different types of monetisation post launch with no notice. Their is a distrust, and rightfully so.
To be fair people spent money on this game and don't have to be happy about anything.  So people have the right to be drama queens about this, especially with what happened with MK1 and Now T8 is running into some of the same issues and all this was after SF6 came out that they should've learned from.
    No being a shithead is just being a shithead whether you paid for it know doesn't justify the constant. Oh, this game is shit I'm right your wrong, oh knee said something negative see I was right.

It's all dumb, criticise don't bitch
I don't know when this community became nothing but bitching but God its exhausting.

Those things ruin the community as well, it makes people not want to engage with the community.
Every one bitching about every character makes people not want to play x character.

This community needs to take a breath and decide if they want the game to get better or just fail because right now it feels like a lot of people just want to see it fail which to me if you like tekken is weird.
        Being a shithead is being a shithead, and being a unfun game is being an unfun game.  I'd always rather people speak on how they feel than just pretend to like something.  That's how we end up with mediocre games.   I don't see anyone saying they want the game to fail, that's not even the conversation right now.  

  
The only people I see wanting it to fail are those who pretty much got played with the sneaky battle pass they added after the game is out like capcom did.  IN that they have every right to be angry.
Exactly, and I think that may be why Knee posted this clarification. The dude absolutely loves Tekken, and the last thing he would want would be for people to use his comments to support their vehement and relentless trashing of the game. I swear it feels like some people here actually want the game to fail, and there's no way Knee would want to encourage or validate that kind of sentiment.
Holy shit they get it! Crazy how this subreddit of all places seems to actively want it to fail......
> I know from watching what happened to OW2 though that it's going to be bad for T8 long term if half the playerbase keeps trying to dismiss any criticism bc of the short-term effect it has on public perception.

on the flipside, it's going to be bad for T8 long term if people only see the community shitting on the game. which is what it currently looks like as someone who isn't super into tekken. i've seen one example of toxic positivity and about 400 posts saying that tekken 8 is a trash game that can't be redeemed
    Naw it'll be okay,  SF5 and T7 got crapped on a lot and were still okay in the long run.   Besides the hardcore don't really care so long as money is on the line, and casuals don't really care so long as what they have works.  That's the problem here, even for hardcore and casuals there's some real bad problems with the game.
There is a huge storage of copium over there, at that Justin Wong post. You might wanna check that out before discussing the curious nuances of the concept of "overall opinion", which you're clearly lacking
    Right, it hasn't been nothing but hating for months. Maybe look at the sub before you make claims about it.
prove it
    you can't read?
        prove that he can't read
    Bro are you dense
        🗿
Yep, fully agreed.
 it’s the only example unless u can name another low that is ch launchsble and is -12
He said worse and worse going into purple ranks. I find that hard to believe.
    purple ranks are dogshit at the gaem 

rank inflation is super high in that gaem, purple ranks in t8 are like yellow ranks in t7
    Considering the spike in new players Tekken 8, the rampant plugging problem that only recently started becoming more manageable, and possibly a third problem I’m not aware of. It’s not impossible for it to be a problem of lacking knowledge.
        There's no way button mashers survive the red ranks. They can probably reach red but that won't last long.
            Just depends on how smart they are with button mashing. Most characters can kill in two launches/ combos.
                But if they're being smart, that's no longer mashing. They're understanding the game now.
                    Hmm yes and no. I know what you mean as it is playing smarter but there’s still mashing in how it’s performed. Like with how Eddie is on his debut. Tons of people winning off of lack of knowledge and mashing a single button. When people say button mashing they don’t always mean random inputs. They just means a constant string of inputs.
                        But if they still act when it's not their turn, they get punished. Like I said, there's no way mashers survive red, moreso purple.
Exactly. If you’re a bit patient in this game you can benefit from the stupidly potent offensive options.
    Part of the problem is your offense has to be just as good as your defense. Or your defense has to be leagues better to compensate now is how it feels to me. I tried playing defensively, and I still "try". But with all the bullshit going on, and just how much quicker people feel in next gen fighting games (maybe I'm just getting old) I find myself quickly saying "if I try to block and punish and lose the interaction TWICE I'm cooked. My best shot is to throw out my fastest/most unexpected combos." I feel as if I'd have to put 300 hours of defensive practice in against each character just to learn 1/3rd of the options I'd have to react to and feel any degree of comfort while on defense
        Yeah that makes sense. I don’t think you even need to know the opposing character to any significant degree and react to every single move they throw with the perfect counter, but at a minimum if you can recognize when it’s not your turn because of a frame disadvantage for example that’s already a huge plus. I think a combination of safe moves leading to launchers, CHs, etc. is pretty effective.
            Duly noted. Will keep add this to my notes and keep it in mind while practicing. Also want to add that I usually feel like I'm pretty decent at reading breaks and pauses and finding the right time to poke in and interrupt or punish. Just the more time I've spent on tekken the more I've realized I'm not that good at it. I get *really* messed up by players like Jun or a GOOD Zafina that either has natural fake pauses in their combos or is good at leaving enough time to make you think there's enough time to interrupt only to get CH Launched
I’m at King too and I don’t see the mash fest to be honest. Maybe we have different definitions of mashing lol. When I was lower ranked yeah I could see dudes just spamming all kinds of BS but here there is some calculation involved and timing when to do shit, generally speaking. 

I think where you said don’t mash when it’s heavily the opponents turn is key. That’s in effect defending. It’s a simple concept but a lot of people suck at doing that. So my point wasn’t that you should play defensively in general but that it’s extremely important to know when to block and when to attack especially in a Tekken where blindly throwing out moves can result in you losing half your life.
    You're playing King, bro lmao nobody will be mashing, no one wants to take a low ch that deals 50 damage or or a ch throw and then you die or heat smash that deals 60 damage.
         tekken king rank, not king the character
            Ah then my apologies, mate
            For real though, is the guy blind? Cant he see you re a Gon main?
                That elite 2 foot hit box!
Yeah and the great thing about simply blocking is that it gives you a chance to see how your opponent likes to play and then react accordingly.
You do not have fundamental defensive skills remotely good enough to judge how rewarding defense is in this game. 

Offense is stronger than defense in every game at lower levels because defense is inherently harder to learn. 

You don't know if defense is unrewarding in tekken 8. You are just trash. And so am I
    Ok, but most of the pros are saying that defense is unrewarding in T8. Are they just trash too?
        Ppl are just trying to tell you that in your couple months timespan with the game, your defence is more than likely still pretty weak so you cant really grasp how good defence is not rewarding. 


If you were playing T7 u d still get blown up by opponent offense bc defence is harder to learn than offense in any game. But good defence can be learnt eventually, however its less rewarding in T8.
You don’t “get” it
    And the pros don't get it either I'm guessing?
        Nah they get it,you don’t
No, the negativity was alive and well for a number of reasons, netcode, performance, plugging, just lots of random issues. 

Then the team doubling down on the ban list etc. 

The good faith was lost. Then as people figured out the game it became more and more obvious how oppressive offense is and how defensive expression is limited. “Why sidestep when you can block”

The game is dope, but the straws have been stacking up on the camels back, it’s not just one thing.

The mxts just put them on blast, all the other negative stuff was more of a critique of the hardcore crowds.
    Yeah but not at launch. It was well received. The issue started when plugging was rampant and they did nothing about it BUT they released a shop. The shop came out a month after launch so we had a decent run. That just solidified that they don't really care about us or the game, they just want our money. That was basically the beginning of the end.
        The game had critiques from the get go. The general media is the only outlet that has changed the narrative. 

It’s not hard to google people talking about all these same problems the first month. We just had a lot of hope and good faith.

Now the game has been out, many flaws that are obvious have been poorly handled, and the mxt stuff just made it all look way worse. 

I agree the game was well received from a broad brush perspective, but at the core, the gameplay issues have been talked about since beta.

*I still think it’s a good ass game and I think most people do, the negativity is because it’s not what it could be*
I just responded to this in another thread, but that's not true. Both games have nearly idnetifcal three month trends, both splayerbases shrinking by the same percentage (around 35% per month). The big difference is T8 started with 40k and T7 started with around 12k.
    Interesting. I guess we need a larger sample size. Might spike after EVO if it's hype, that generally brings in new players.
Crazy how it's only been three months. It's been a rollercoaster already
    Yeah, I don't think this is good for the longevity of the game. T7 overall was pretty smooth until the busted DLCs showed up but that was years after the launch.
        It's true though that when T7 got released, it had technically already been out for a few years to become smooth.

I think a lot will depend on how the tournaments will turn out and how they are received. Can we get anything as hype as T7 tournaments in this game? Hard to say with how volatile the gameplay is. The methodical style of T7 might have its flaws but it made close games much more intense to watch because they lasted longer
            As boring as the overly defensive gameplay was, it actually helped build a lot of tension knowing that something still had to give and the fight would begin in earnest. T8 has virtually none of that suspense and feels more like a Wild West quick-draw showdown.
            Evo is going to be a big test for this games tournament scene. If it's well received the game will keep growing. If not we're in trouble.
As a new player who still doesn't care too much about franchise although I REALLY do enjoy Tekken 8.

I can only imagine the cries of the players if they would deliver Tekken 9 as a fullgame. 1 balance patch and that's it. Even less skins than now. Go the MK route. And then also deliver

No mtx. No dlc's. No updates for 5 years. Pretty sure this would make ppl quit even faster lol
    T7 survived for almost ten years and the only content we got were characters. That game was great. They abandoned it towards the end to focus on T8 but it was still super active.

I don't think this game will have the same life span or sales.
        I was a nolife gamer for the years where T7 was out and I didn't even know the game existed or had any playerbase

For the most part from what I see Tekken had around 4k active players even in 2016 XD

Yea survived is a good phrase. All I see is current community making sure T8 won't be bought by potentially interested new players for the next 4years
            T7 was a game made with a budget of 3 happy meals and 0 marketing after a failed last game. T8 is coming in with massive marketing and budget +goodwill of the people that it built up in T7 and is looking to end up in the same or worse place than T7 was.
Yeah, I guess so. That's why the game has mixed reviews on steam
    People have been review bombing the game ever since the Micro transactions got announced it has nothing to do with the actual game
        mtx is in the game though so it literally does have things to do with the game. And wtf is this review bombing shit, you think you can convince thousands of people to do what they dot want to do? if the mtx wasn't a problem people wouldn't be reviewing it badly, review bombing doesn't exist especially when you have to buy the game.
    Which sucks because I think the game is really fun just needs some tweaks and less MTXs.
        Yeah :/ I've kind of dropped the game at this point. Maybe I'll try again after Evo japan, or one of my characters gets announced.
            Sorry bro :(
Right, but you're just repeating yourself though.

Don't be negative because it pushes away positivity.  
Why does that matter?  
Because it pushes away positivity.

What is the actual benefit to those wanting a better game? Like, sure, shut up so redditor 136794 can post their cosplay, but how is that actually doing anything worth justifying shutting down discourse?
    Only speak positive, comrade
    If the people in the community aren’t comfortable talking about what makes the game good then you can’t expect to have an honest conversation about the state of the game.
        Then just talk about it though? Why is the presence of some people being negative bad for discussions, while you specifically wanting to disallow people from vocalizing in specific ways healthy?

Either have the discussion or don't, but you can't expect to police how people express themselves when that's exactly what's needed to gauge the state of the game's reception. Both ways.
            Ideally people aren’t affected by other peoples opinions and so whatever ratio of positivity to negativity is how the audience actually feels. In reality whenever the initial reaction to something is extremely negative most people that would have something positive to say, will not want to do so. I’m not acting like this is something that people are willing to fix themselves, i’m just pointing out what’s happening
                Fair enough, not trying to dismiss the validity of newcomers possibly being pushed away. However, having everyone misrepresent their own opinions to match some sort of acceptable range (so long as it's not actual bullying or spreading hate of course) is no more acceptable of a solution than telling more positive minded users to refrain from praising any element until the smoke clears.

With the key point being that positivity only rewards the current state of the game and encourages devs in what many believe to be very incorrect decisions, and just straight up manipulation in some sense, then you're artificially pushing aside negativity that needs to be heard as well. And it's that kind of behavior that causes us to end up with lower quality products, MTX, etc.

Absolutely be positive if you want, praise the elements you like, and I recommend everyone do so, but not to the point where it becomes a toxic positivity circlejerk purely because "that's better than being negative".
    Welcome to the vibes era

Meaningful discourse isnt meant for casuals, just vibes
    I think the intention was to highlight that being more specific with criticism and less doom posting might make the community and the game better. But I can read minds over the internet.
idky y’all be acting like top player’s don’t use rage art. rage art + heat smash is cancer.
    It’s really not and you’re not even on topic anymore. It was in t7. Heat smash is harder to deal with sure. Still not game breaking. Oh no you get 50/50d just like in every other tekken game or fighting game 🥴🥴🥴
        well in my opinion it is. heat smash + rage art + power crush heat engagers are cancer. idc what u talkin bout. ur obviously some loser ass nigga who thinks his opinion matters cuz he slightly decent at tekken.
            Lmao you’re such a pussy and that’s evident. Why would anyone care about what someone who is just a whiner and garbage have to say anyway? Your opinion is just stupid. You can’t even speak  your some broke ass uneducated actual loser in everything you do, don’t be mad at me for it
                bruh stop all that yappin lol u claim ur life better than mine so lets prove it. all i said was u being good at tekken was irrelevant to life and you starting goin off on a tangent. must be insecure about some things lol.
                    Nah you came up in here on my shit first. If you could read, you’d have noticed I said FROM and then elaborated that I’m from, not IN, meaning I live somewhere else, Baltimore. I see the education quality hasn’t changed there at all. Sad. You’re just another wanna be dime a dozen tough dude when you start realizing you’re saying stupid shit “come and see irl” LMAO anybody saying that shit isn’t scary, can’t fight, and ain’t shit. You’re the insecure one and that’s exactly why you resort to such a stupid thing to say.
                        But super congrats on being the dumbest fuck I’ve ever seen in this sub. Don’t get shot in Baltimore trying to be what you ain’t 🤷‍♀️
                        bro i said stop all that yappin either prove u on sum or just shut ur monkey mouth. I’m not from baltimore #1 and if you can’t understand what i’m saying that shows how ignorant you are, not me. so once again, stop yappin, you said your life better than mine lets prove it. We in the same area 🤔
There are legit criticisms but “wahhh wage art” isn’t one of them.
    that’s your opinion. acting like your some top player and you can dictate what people have issue with doesn’t help anything 🤣
        Im not dictating what you have an issue with I’m saying it’s not a legitimate issue. You’re just a scrub.
            bro idc what u think i am, u being good at tekken means absolutely nothing in life lol.
                Ah my point. We’re talking about tekken tho so…”hehe you’re good at game but not life” typical last resort when you’re losing an argument. Time to log off scrub. My life is still better than yours too so 🤷‍♀️
                    idc about your point lol you called me a scrub, so im telling you. you being good at a video is irrelevant to the grand scheme of life. 😂 and if u from baltimore we can link up and see who life really better 🤔
                        From and living in are different things buddy. You ain’t scary pussy
You used backdash to create whiffs... that's the whole point
    KBD is an exploit, it is not a mechanic, the reason they made backdash nerfed is literally because they aren't meant to be like that
    Backdash is a thing

korean backdash is another thing

Whats the matter to play a FIGHT GAME that players go running back back back?

    I'm misspelling some words on purpose. At first its cause I was lazy and did not know how to spell "probably" right and always spelled probly, but now I'm doing it on purpose cause chat bots and ai don't do stuff like that and I think it's just more fun, although I still use proper grammer for essays and stuff

    I’m glad Lil B gets his flowers on this because he literally came up with the slang and now people don’t even realize how strongly it’s associated with him
        Lil B had waaay more influence than people will ever give him credit for lol
            ya ill contribute to this tangent. i love that man. real ones know
        Yeah man he's from Berkeley/Oakland. I remember my friend Natasha now known as Kreayshawn used to shoot videos for Lil B. She began a music career when she saw how easy it was to do music videos and go viral
Idk the origin really and as far as i know it's not really used in a "based on this.." way. It's actually kind of a running meme that ppl reply "based on what?" When they don't understand how or why the word is being used that way. Sorry if this explanation is lacking.
    Nah you're good, thank you.
based on your mom lmao gottem
Literally just means that the person is standing on a strong ideological base and that they aren't likely to be pushed off of it because it is strong. Overwhelmingly used as a compliment, although it is possible to be based on a flawed foundation.
You take chip damage "grey health" when you block attacks. You regen grey health when you attack whether its blocked or it hits. Engaging heat heals all your grey health. You lose when all your red health is gone, though you can't be chipped to death.

When tekken 8 was announced and the new systems talked about. I thought chip only happened while in heat. But thats not true. Which seems weird.
Not all moves add chip damage.  But those that do give chip damage in heat or not.  (Damage goes up in heat though)
I mean...are you sure that beginner and intermediate players are the ones who do the turtling? I would much rather say that advanced and pro players tend to turtle way more and beginners and intermediates tend to learn strings and flowcharts and spam them all the time.
    Its about 50/50 in my experience. Its not that beginners are blocking everything it just that i noticed that some tend to slowly back walk away instead of trying to attack. As in i would do a clearly unsafe option and they just back walk and avoid interaction. I dont know how beginner Jins ive played that just back walk and the moment i go for an interaction demon paw or Bryan u4. Now it could just be my luck or region but about 85% of my online matches are overly defensive players both beginner and intermediate, 5% intermediate/advanced spammers, and the rest are a mixed grab bag of players who kinda what they are doing.
        I have a totally different experience, honestly. Beginners are overly aggressive and tend to mash even when they're heavily under frames or they throw the most unsafe but flashy move. Intermediates tend to keep the distance and approach with safe moves like Jin's ff2 because it is actually a more "thought through" way to play the game. Advanced and pro players usually pick you apart with movement usually using only ultra-safe strings and pokes.
not in heat it's not, it's safe during heat
Idk if I can give you "it's not that complicated"
I'll go ahead and post the anonymous tekken player bitching flow chart

1\. "I'm GoD"

"No you're not you're lying"

2\. "I'm TGS"

"Wow not even GoD? I am, don't talk to me"

3\. "Any other rank"

"I'm (your rank+3), scrub"

regardless you're a scrub with a bitchmade mentality
    Thank you for the meltdown, we all enjoy a good laugh 😂😂
        That was a pretty wild ride, wasn't it? Lol. 

  
I hope he doesn't delete the comment chain, that was a hell of a train wreck.
        Stay scrubby
            Stay obese and miserable
                project harder
                    Why do you talk like an incel?
The opponent is in a forced block for 17 frames. They can't do anything but block.
Like people have said, the opponent can still block and duck during those 17 frames. This kind of frame advantage is sometimes labeled as +17g where g I think stands for "guard" and many situations in the game have this, like Kazuya's df1,4 being +17g or something on hit and his db4 doing similar on counter hit, as opposed to Jin's 4 being a true +13 on ch and granting him guaranteed followups
sometimes things that are +10 or more will still allow the opponent to block, it just depends on the moves. Heat Engagers always allow the opponent to block. You are right in your assumption that +17 should mean a 17 frame or faster move would hit, but tekken is complicated so it doesn't work that way in some instances.
For most characters, their fastest move is 10f.

Being +17 means they cannot do anything else than block for the first 17 frames you can move. That means any move that's 26 frames or less (which is very slow) is uninterruptable.
It means you can act 17 frames before your opponent can. It doesn't mean they can't block.
This would be true if this game wouldnt be a 50/50 spam fest. You can learn strings and stuff but it all goes out of the window if you just have to guess.
>implying the gods of defensive Tekken have been able to consistently sidestep/duck/low parry/interrupt things when it matters most to win them games. Except it doesn't.

Seems like you're missing the whole point. Strong defensive Tekken is not as well rewarded as it should be. Playing well in Tekken 8 is constantly attacking to run your game and making sure the other player isn't allowed to attack, or play the game. Blocking is important for other things aside from just deciding to turtle up and bait CHs.

"the issue is that there's some absurd moves in the game right now that track too well or are too plus where you don't have good options other than block"

So you agree with me. Offense is too oppressive and too punishing towards defensive players. You're being punished for blocking not because of chip damage, but because you're forced to constantly take mixups and are put into disadvantageous situations where you're just blocking. Not turtling, not trying to run out the clock. Just. Blocking.

That's the problem.
I actually really enjoy combat sports (mostly MMA but also some boxing), so I appreciate what you're saying, in that there's a rich combination of factors that make analyzing a fight enjoyable.

What I would offer you is that a fighter breaking down their opponent's defense is usually achieved by how effectively they can bypass the opponent's guard - going for the body, kicking the legs. You usually have to hit your opponent somewhere other than his guard in order to make your exertion worth it. In Tekken this is simulated by fast pokes that are easy to land but do just a little damage.

In real life, I would argue that a person who is effectively able to check every one of his opponent's attacks will have the advantage, all else being equal. If I check three hard low kicks I expect your leg is going to hurt more than mine, but I wouldn't want my opponent in game to take (gray health) damage just by me blocking their lows - it's more interesting and skillful that I have to select and apply an appropriate punish rather than damage just being awarded.
How many casuals even know about Knee and Arslan? I mean T7 sold like 10M~11M copies. Like the most viewed T7 vid is the Arslan vs Knee at 2.2M views after 4 years even if we assume twice as many people will see their tweets that would still be less than half all the people who ever played T7 knowing about them.
That’s complete bs and you know nothing about competitive games then.
    Haha sure:), when movement doesnt work, when throws are tracking and unbreakable on ch, when you skip neutral with so many brainless easy tools, when you force 5050 with no risk etc. Youre living in the past where tekken WAS kinda competitive, youre like those who atill calling Shaheen a honest character, its T8 baby, the game where option select is part of the past.
        Just because Tekken 8 is more aggressive doesn’t mean it’s not competitive. And 50/50s always have a degree of risk because if you block the low you are almost always getting combo’s for 70+. You can reduce the amount of 50/50s with good movement. If you do 20 dmg to your opponent and they haven’t done any you can just stand back and force them to come to you. Movement doesn’t work? More like you don’t know how to move. Movement literally got buffed from T7. Homing throws are a bit annoying but you can also just duck. Tekken has always been a mixup oriented game. Most characters aren’t that brainless except for about 5 characters. The game has also been out for only 3 months. T7 had 2 years of balance tweaks before it arrived to console. If any changes need to seriously be made, we’ll see them after Japan EVO once the devs can see what current behavior is busted in competitive play. Especially if they see half the cast play Azu.
            Yeah , i dont know how to move  yet eddy powercrush hit me on his back, and I blocked drag's wr2 when I was litteraly on his back , got hit by Ninas F1+2 when I was on her back and endless similar situations, movement is litteraly trash, and even more trash due to hitboxes being buffed ( the problem is the new hitboxes and not the movement probably). Also some 50/50 are 0 to none risk especially on heat. This game wants you to just throw bs overtuned moves like reinas 3+4,4,4 or victors u1+2 , those with other dozens of braindead "just throw" and hope for the best. Game is currently objectively shit on the competitive scense. Also heatsmashes , the vest just throw and hope for the best, has weird evasiveness and tracking, ghost range, free 5050 on block for snowball, if you manage to step some of them, gl punishing it due to forward momentum, way way too much reward for 0 risk. This game is a joke currently. Its fun though at least not against the top 8 characters.

P.s - dont forget that mr.Murray once said "why would you move when you can just block anf punish" this became real in this game with its casino unescapable 50/50 and random tracking of neutral killing moves like mishimas demon paws, dvj uf1 , lilis df3+4 etc... just random full screen tracking.
                Must powercrushes are steppable. Drag’s WR2 is steppable. Reina’s 3+4,4,4 is annoying but is punishable with a 12f or can get rekt by a well timed mid. Expulsion is literally launch punishable, it just forces crouch so it’s got to be a WS combo. Some of the tracking in the game is a bit rough. Demon Paw is a good example. And aside from characters like Azu and Drag there is a fair amount of counterplay. People love to toss around the term casino but anyone with a strong kbd can force a fair amount of whiffs, or an armor can interrupt some 50/50s.
                    Powercrushes are steppable, but everything randomly tacking in this game. Wr2 is steppable too  but why did I block it when I was 180° to the actual diraction?3+4,4,4 -8 on blick and explusion -4 in heat(imo the dumbest buffed move rn, you litteraly have to block it cuz its tracking and full screen) basivclly punishing you for blocking, or even worse, eating a full combo damage from 1 move thats safe.  With all the randomness rng based bs that occures in this game its shit, also when you manage to sidestep a certain move or string the whiff punish may whiff for no reason , there are some consistant interactions, also random camera changes makes a df2 punish into db2 for example, this game is so far from being solid enough to start talking about competitive gameplay.
The lawyers are on to us we gotta koreanbackdash out of here
    Oh no dude, you put me on p2 side! 

wavuwavuwavuwavuwavu
They're lawyers, they 100% know some yakuza dudes. Knee is probably held hostage and the bandai namco yakuza department wrote that tweet.
    You know what, I 100% believe you
I'm not denying that, but don't tell me you've never come across a lawyer threatening a meaningless lawsuit around flimsy logic. My company had received a summons for piracy when they had zero proof we used their product. We were one of the few that could fight back, so we challenged them and put them in their place. But a lot of others settled because they had threatened a lot and asked for so less. 

Also, we were one of the few that didn't actually use their industry standard software.
    And you think it's a likely scenario that Bamco lawyers are going after Knee because he is a struggling member of the lower class who can't fight back?
        Bruh, Just saying lawyers can and will make issue if they are asked to do so. You want proof ? Just check out John Oliver's case. And no, Knee is not bigger than John Oliver. 

A random ass libel suite. One year later the case was dismissed. But guess what, his insurance went up, and damage was done. AND THIS WAS FOR A SEGMENT ON SLAPP LAWSUITS.

I'm not implying that there were any lawyers involved in this Knee statement lol. Bamco aren't stupid, nor do they have any reason to do so. However, if, and again, IF they did want to, you can bet that they can cause more than enough trouble for said person to retract their statements. Especially because said persons livelihood depends on being associated with their game.
            And you think the John Oliver case, where he is talking about SLAPP lawsuits, is comparable to this situation where Knee is saying he doesn't like the Tekken metagame?
                If you think a corporate lawyer cannot touch you, for an innocent statement like what Knee made, then you haven't met enough of these guy my man. That's all I'm saying. Most lawyers do what they do, to make your life hard, and have you submit. Nothing more than that, they don't even want to go to court.

Anyways, I'm not implying Bamco did anything here. And this pretty much useless discussion has run its course. Its naive you think you can't be sued for something you didn't do. You absolutely can, and a lot of times, even people as big and backed up as international celebrities are made to pay, on a case that has zero merits whatsoever. So unless you live in a state / country with good anti SLAPP laws or some version of it, you're fully liable to be bullied. Its a hard fact to accept, but it goes on every single day around the world.
                    I am not saying people don't get frivolous lawsuits. I am saying the threat of a frivolous lawsuit is not there in this situation. There is nothing to work with.
It's also pit a bad taste in people's mouth by having 3 different types of monetisation post launch with no notice. Their is a distrust, and rightfully so.
No being a shithead is just being a shithead whether you paid for it know doesn't justify the constant. Oh, this game is shit I'm right your wrong, oh knee said something negative see I was right.

It's all dumb, criticise don't bitch
I don't know when this community became nothing but bitching but God its exhausting.

Those things ruin the community as well, it makes people not want to engage with the community.
Every one bitching about every character makes people not want to play x character.

This community needs to take a breath and decide if they want the game to get better or just fail because right now it feels like a lot of people just want to see it fail which to me if you like tekken is weird.
    Being a shithead is being a shithead, and being a unfun game is being an unfun game.  I'd always rather people speak on how they feel than just pretend to like something.  That's how we end up with mediocre games.   I don't see anyone saying they want the game to fail, that's not even the conversation right now.  

  
The only people I see wanting it to fail are those who pretty much got played with the sneaky battle pass they added after the game is out like capcom did.  IN that they have every right to be angry.
Naw it'll be okay,  SF5 and T7 got crapped on a lot and were still okay in the long run.   Besides the hardcore don't really care so long as money is on the line, and casuals don't really care so long as what they have works.  That's the problem here, even for hardcore and casuals there's some real bad problems with the game.
Right, it hasn't been nothing but hating for months. Maybe look at the sub before you make claims about it.

purple ranks are dogshit at the gaem 

rank inflation is super high in that gaem, purple ranks in t8 are like yellow ranks in t7
Considering the spike in new players Tekken 8, the rampant plugging problem that only recently started becoming more manageable, and possibly a third problem I’m not aware of. It’s not impossible for it to be a problem of lacking knowledge.
    There's no way button mashers survive the red ranks. They can probably reach red but that won't last long.
        Just depends on how smart they are with button mashing. Most characters can kill in two launches/ combos.
            But if they're being smart, that's no longer mashing. They're understanding the game now.
                Hmm yes and no. I know what you mean as it is playing smarter but there’s still mashing in how it’s performed. Like with how Eddie is on his debut. Tons of people winning off of lack of knowledge and mashing a single button. When people say button mashing they don’t always mean random inputs. They just means a constant string of inputs.
                    But if they still act when it's not their turn, they get punished. Like I said, there's no way mashers survive red, moreso purple.
Part of the problem is your offense has to be just as good as your defense. Or your defense has to be leagues better to compensate now is how it feels to me. I tried playing defensively, and I still "try". But with all the bullshit going on, and just how much quicker people feel in next gen fighting games (maybe I'm just getting old) I find myself quickly saying "if I try to block and punish and lose the interaction TWICE I'm cooked. My best shot is to throw out my fastest/most unexpected combos." I feel as if I'd have to put 300 hours of defensive practice in against each character just to learn 1/3rd of the options I'd have to react to and feel any degree of comfort while on defense
    Yeah that makes sense. I don’t think you even need to know the opposing character to any significant degree and react to every single move they throw with the perfect counter, but at a minimum if you can recognize when it’s not your turn because of a frame disadvantage for example that’s already a huge plus. I think a combination of safe moves leading to launchers, CHs, etc. is pretty effective.
        Duly noted. Will keep add this to my notes and keep it in mind while practicing. Also want to add that I usually feel like I'm pretty decent at reading breaks and pauses and finding the right time to poke in and interrupt or punish. Just the more time I've spent on tekken the more I've realized I'm not that good at it. I get *really* messed up by players like Jun or a GOOD Zafina that either has natural fake pauses in their combos or is good at leaving enough time to make you think there's enough time to interrupt only to get CH Launched
You're playing King, bro lmao nobody will be mashing, no one wants to take a low ch that deals 50 damage or or a ch throw and then you die or heat smash that deals 60 damage.
     tekken king rank, not king the character
        Ah then my apologies, mate
        For real though, is the guy blind? Cant he see you re a Gon main?
            That elite 2 foot hit box!
Ok, but most of the pros are saying that defense is unrewarding in T8. Are they just trash too?
    Ppl are just trying to tell you that in your couple months timespan with the game, your defence is more than likely still pretty weak so you cant really grasp how good defence is not rewarding. 


If you were playing T7 u d still get blown up by opponent offense bc defence is harder to learn than offense in any game. But good defence can be learnt eventually, however its less rewarding in T8.
And the pros don't get it either I'm guessing?
    Nah they get it,you don’t
Yeah but not at launch. It was well received. The issue started when plugging was rampant and they did nothing about it BUT they released a shop. The shop came out a month after launch so we had a decent run. That just solidified that they don't really care about us or the game, they just want our money. That was basically the beginning of the end.
    The game had critiques from the get go. The general media is the only outlet that has changed the narrative. 

It’s not hard to google people talking about all these same problems the first month. We just had a lot of hope and good faith.

Now the game has been out, many flaws that are obvious have been poorly handled, and the mxt stuff just made it all look way worse. 

I agree the game was well received from a broad brush perspective, but at the core, the gameplay issues have been talked about since beta.

*I still think it’s a good ass game and I think most people do, the negativity is because it’s not what it could be*
Interesting. I guess we need a larger sample size. Might spike after EVO if it's hype, that generally brings in new players.
Yeah, I don't think this is good for the longevity of the game. T7 overall was pretty smooth until the busted DLCs showed up but that was years after the launch.
    It's true though that when T7 got released, it had technically already been out for a few years to become smooth.

I think a lot will depend on how the tournaments will turn out and how they are received. Can we get anything as hype as T7 tournaments in this game? Hard to say with how volatile the gameplay is. The methodical style of T7 might have its flaws but it made close games much more intense to watch because they lasted longer
        As boring as the overly defensive gameplay was, it actually helped build a lot of tension knowing that something still had to give and the fight would begin in earnest. T8 has virtually none of that suspense and feels more like a Wild West quick-draw showdown.
        Evo is going to be a big test for this games tournament scene. If it's well received the game will keep growing. If not we're in trouble.
T7 survived for almost ten years and the only content we got were characters. That game was great. They abandoned it towards the end to focus on T8 but it was still super active.

I don't think this game will have the same life span or sales.
    I was a nolife gamer for the years where T7 was out and I didn't even know the game existed or had any playerbase

For the most part from what I see Tekken had around 4k active players even in 2016 XD

Yea survived is a good phrase. All I see is current community making sure T8 won't be bought by potentially interested new players for the next 4years
        T7 was a game made with a budget of 3 happy meals and 0 marketing after a failed last game. T8 is coming in with massive marketing and budget +goodwill of the people that it built up in T7 and is looking to end up in the same or worse place than T7 was.
People have been review bombing the game ever since the Micro transactions got announced it has nothing to do with the actual game
    mtx is in the game though so it literally does have things to do with the game. And wtf is this review bombing shit, you think you can convince thousands of people to do what they dot want to do? if the mtx wasn't a problem people wouldn't be reviewing it badly, review bombing doesn't exist especially when you have to buy the game.
Which sucks because I think the game is really fun just needs some tweaks and less MTXs.
    Yeah :/ I've kind of dropped the game at this point. Maybe I'll try again after Evo japan, or one of my characters gets announced.
        Sorry bro :(
Only speak positive, comrade
If the people in the community aren’t comfortable talking about what makes the game good then you can’t expect to have an honest conversation about the state of the game.
    Then just talk about it though? Why is the presence of some people being negative bad for discussions, while you specifically wanting to disallow people from vocalizing in specific ways healthy?

Either have the discussion or don't, but you can't expect to police how people express themselves when that's exactly what's needed to gauge the state of the game's reception. Both ways.
        Ideally people aren’t affected by other peoples opinions and so whatever ratio of positivity to negativity is how the audience actually feels. In reality whenever the initial reaction to something is extremely negative most people that would have something positive to say, will not want to do so. I’m not acting like this is something that people are willing to fix themselves, i’m just pointing out what’s happening
            Fair enough, not trying to dismiss the validity of newcomers possibly being pushed away. However, having everyone misrepresent their own opinions to match some sort of acceptable range (so long as it's not actual bullying or spreading hate of course) is no more acceptable of a solution than telling more positive minded users to refrain from praising any element until the smoke clears.

With the key point being that positivity only rewards the current state of the game and encourages devs in what many believe to be very incorrect decisions, and just straight up manipulation in some sense, then you're artificially pushing aside negativity that needs to be heard as well. And it's that kind of behavior that causes us to end up with lower quality products, MTX, etc.

Absolutely be positive if you want, praise the elements you like, and I recommend everyone do so, but not to the point where it becomes a toxic positivity circlejerk purely because "that's better than being negative".
Welcome to the vibes era

Meaningful discourse isnt meant for casuals, just vibes
I think the intention was to highlight that being more specific with criticism and less doom posting might make the community and the game better. But I can read minds over the internet.
It’s really not and you’re not even on topic anymore. It was in t7. Heat smash is harder to deal with sure. Still not game breaking. Oh no you get 50/50d just like in every other tekken game or fighting game 🥴🥴🥴
    well in my opinion it is. heat smash + rage art + power crush heat engagers are cancer. idc what u talkin bout. ur obviously some loser ass nigga who thinks his opinion matters cuz he slightly decent at tekken.
        Lmao you’re such a pussy and that’s evident. Why would anyone care about what someone who is just a whiner and garbage have to say anyway? Your opinion is just stupid. You can’t even speak  your some broke ass uneducated actual loser in everything you do, don’t be mad at me for it
            bruh stop all that yappin lol u claim ur life better than mine so lets prove it. all i said was u being good at tekken was irrelevant to life and you starting goin off on a tangent. must be insecure about some things lol.
                Nah you came up in here on my shit first. If you could read, you’d have noticed I said FROM and then elaborated that I’m from, not IN, meaning I live somewhere else, Baltimore. I see the education quality hasn’t changed there at all. Sad. You’re just another wanna be dime a dozen tough dude when you start realizing you’re saying stupid shit “come and see irl” LMAO anybody saying that shit isn’t scary, can’t fight, and ain’t shit. You’re the insecure one and that’s exactly why you resort to such a stupid thing to say.
                    But super congrats on being the dumbest fuck I’ve ever seen in this sub. Don’t get shot in Baltimore trying to be what you ain’t 🤷‍♀️
                    bro i said stop all that yappin either prove u on sum or just shut ur monkey mouth. I’m not from baltimore #1 and if you can’t understand what i’m saying that shows how ignorant you are, not me. so once again, stop yappin, you said your life better than mine lets prove it. We in the same area 🤔
that’s your opinion. acting like your some top player and you can dictate what people have issue with doesn’t help anything 🤣
    Im not dictating what you have an issue with I’m saying it’s not a legitimate issue. You’re just a scrub.
        bro idc what u think i am, u being good at tekken means absolutely nothing in life lol.
            Ah my point. We’re talking about tekken tho so…”hehe you’re good at game but not life” typical last resort when you’re losing an argument. Time to log off scrub. My life is still better than yours too so 🤷‍♀️
                idc about your point lol you called me a scrub, so im telling you. you being good at a video is irrelevant to the grand scheme of life. 😂 and if u from baltimore we can link up and see who life really better 🤔
                    From and living in are different things buddy. You ain’t scary pussy
KBD is an exploit, it is not a mechanic, the reason they made backdash nerfed is literally because they aren't meant to be like that
Backdash is a thing

korean backdash is another thing

Whats the matter to play a FIGHT GAME that players go running back back back?

He did the T3 Yoshi side-throw once and the two halves never merged back together.
I'm misspelling some words on purpose. At first its cause I was lazy and did not know how to spell "probably" right and always spelled probly, but now I'm doing it on purpose cause chat bots and ai don't do stuff like that and I think it's just more fun, although I still use proper grammer for essays and stuff
    You did that last one on purpose, didn’t you?
I’m glad Lil B gets his flowers on this because he literally came up with the slang and now people don’t even realize how strongly it’s associated with him
    Lil B had waaay more influence than people will ever give him credit for lol
        ya ill contribute to this tangent. i love that man. real ones know
    Yeah man he's from Berkeley/Oakland. I remember my friend Natasha now known as Kreayshawn used to shoot videos for Lil B. She began a music career when she saw how easy it was to do music videos and go viral
Nah you're good, thank you.
Its about 50/50 in my experience. Its not that beginners are blocking everything it just that i noticed that some tend to slowly back walk away instead of trying to attack. As in i would do a clearly unsafe option and they just back walk and avoid interaction. I dont know how beginner Jins ive played that just back walk and the moment i go for an interaction demon paw or Bryan u4. Now it could just be my luck or region but about 85% of my online matches are overly defensive players both beginner and intermediate, 5% intermediate/advanced spammers, and the rest are a mixed grab bag of players who kinda what they are doing.
    I have a totally different experience, honestly. Beginners are overly aggressive and tend to mash even when they're heavily under frames or they throw the most unsafe but flashy move. Intermediates tend to keep the distance and approach with safe moves like Jin's ff2 because it is actually a more "thought through" way to play the game. Advanced and pro players usually pick you apart with movement usually using only ultra-safe strings and pokes.
Thank you for the meltdown, we all enjoy a good laugh 😂😂
    That was a pretty wild ride, wasn't it? Lol. 

  
I hope he doesn't delete the comment chain, that was a hell of a train wreck.

        Yeah , i dont know how to move  yet eddy powercrush hit me on his back, and I blocked drag's wr2 when I was litteraly on his back , got hit by Ninas F1+2 when I was on her back and endless similar situations, movement is litteraly trash, and even more trash due to hitboxes being buffed ( the problem is the new hitboxes and not the movement probably). Also some 50/50 are 0 to none risk especially on heat. This game wants you to just throw bs overtuned moves like reinas 3+4,4,4 or victors u1+2 , those with other dozens of braindead "just throw" and hope for the best. Game is currently objectively shit on the competitive scense. Also heatsmashes , the vest just throw and hope for the best, has weird evasiveness and tracking, ghost range, free 5050 on block for snowball, if you manage to step some of them, gl punishing it due to forward momentum, way way too much reward for 0 risk. This game is a joke currently. Its fun though at least not against the top 8 characters.

P.s - dont forget that mr.Murray once said "why would you move when you can just block anf punish" this became real in this game with its casino unescapable 50/50 and random tracking of neutral killing moves like mishimas demon paws, dvj uf1 , lilis df3+4 etc... just random full screen tracking.
            Must powercrushes are steppable. Drag’s WR2 is steppable. Reina’s 3+4,4,4 is annoying but is punishable with a 12f or can get rekt by a well timed mid. Expulsion is literally launch punishable, it just forces crouch so it’s got to be a WS combo. Some of the tracking in the game is a bit rough. Demon Paw is a good example. And aside from characters like Azu and Drag there is a fair amount of counterplay. People love to toss around the term casino but anyone with a strong kbd can force a fair amount of whiffs, or an armor can interrupt some 50/50s.
                Powercrushes are steppable, but everything randomly tacking in this game. Wr2 is steppable too  but why did I block it when I was 180° to the actual diraction?3+4,4,4 -8 on blick and explusion -4 in heat(imo the dumbest buffed move rn, you litteraly have to block it cuz its tracking and full screen) basivclly punishing you for blocking, or even worse, eating a full combo damage from 1 move thats safe.  With all the randomness rng based bs that occures in this game its shit, also when you manage to sidestep a certain move or string the whiff punish may whiff for no reason , there are some consistant interactions, also random camera changes makes a df2 punish into db2 for example, this game is so far from being solid enough to start talking about competitive gameplay.
Oh no dude, you put me on p2 side!

You know what, I 100% believe you
And you think it's a likely scenario that Bamco lawyers are going after Knee because he is a struggling member of the lower class who can't fight back?
    Bruh, Just saying lawyers can and will make issue if they are asked to do so. You want proof ? Just check out John Oliver's case. And no, Knee is not bigger than John Oliver. 

A random ass libel suite. One year later the case was dismissed. But guess what, his insurance went up, and damage was done. AND THIS WAS FOR A SEGMENT ON SLAPP LAWSUITS.

I'm not implying that there were any lawyers involved in this Knee statement lol. Bamco aren't stupid, nor do they have any reason to do so. However, if, and again, IF they did want to, you can bet that they can cause more than enough trouble for said person to retract their statements. Especially because said persons livelihood depends on being associated with their game.
        And you think the John Oliver case, where he is talking about SLAPP lawsuits, is comparable to this situation where Knee is saying he doesn't like the Tekken metagame?
            If you think a corporate lawyer cannot touch you, for an innocent statement like what Knee made, then you haven't met enough of these guy my man. That's all I'm saying. Most lawyers do what they do, to make your life hard, and have you submit. Nothing more than that, they don't even want to go to court.

Anyways, I'm not implying Bamco did anything here. And this pretty much useless discussion has run its course. Its naive you think you can't be sued for something you didn't do. You absolutely can, and a lot of times, even people as big and backed up as international celebrities are made to pay, on a case that has zero merits whatsoever. So unless you live in a state / country with good anti SLAPP laws or some version of it, you're fully liable to be bullied. Its a hard fact to accept, but it goes on every single day around the world.
                I am not saying people don't get frivolous lawsuits. I am saying the threat of a frivolous lawsuit is not there in this situation. There is nothing to work with.
Being a shithead is being a shithead, and being a unfun game is being an unfun game.  I'd always rather people speak on how they feel than just pretend to like something.  That's how we end up with mediocre games.   I don't see anyone saying they want the game to fail, that's not even the conversation right now.  

  
The only people I see wanting it to fail are those who pretty much got played with the sneaky battle pass they added after the game is out like capcom did.  IN that they have every right to be angry.

There's no way button mashers survive the red ranks. They can probably reach red but that won't last long.
    Just depends on how smart they are with button mashing. Most characters can kill in two launches/ combos.
        But if they're being smart, that's no longer mashing. They're understanding the game now.
            Hmm yes and no. I know what you mean as it is playing smarter but there’s still mashing in how it’s performed. Like with how Eddie is on his debut. Tons of people winning off of lack of knowledge and mashing a single button. When people say button mashing they don’t always mean random inputs. They just means a constant string of inputs.
                But if they still act when it's not their turn, they get punished. Like I said, there's no way mashers survive red, moreso purple.
Yeah that makes sense. I don’t think you even need to know the opposing character to any significant degree and react to every single move they throw with the perfect counter, but at a minimum if you can recognize when it’s not your turn because of a frame disadvantage for example that’s already a huge plus. I think a combination of safe moves leading to launchers, CHs, etc. is pretty effective.
    Duly noted. Will keep add this to my notes and keep it in mind while practicing. Also want to add that I usually feel like I'm pretty decent at reading breaks and pauses and finding the right time to poke in and interrupt or punish. Just the more time I've spent on tekken the more I've realized I'm not that good at it. I get *really* messed up by players like Jun or a GOOD Zafina that either has natural fake pauses in their combos or is good at leaving enough time to make you think there's enough time to interrupt only to get CH Launched
 tekken king rank, not king the character
    Ah then my apologies, mate
    For real though, is the guy blind? Cant he see you re a Gon main?
        That elite 2 foot hit box!
Ppl are just trying to tell you that in your couple months timespan with the game, your defence is more than likely still pretty weak so you cant really grasp how good defence is not rewarding. 


If you were playing T7 u d still get blown up by opponent offense bc defence is harder to learn than offense in any game. But good defence can be learnt eventually, however its less rewarding in T8.
Nah they get it,you don’t
The game had critiques from the get go. The general media is the only outlet that has changed the narrative. 

It’s not hard to google people talking about all these same problems the first month. We just had a lot of hope and good faith.

Now the game has been out, many flaws that are obvious have been poorly handled, and the mxt stuff just made it all look way worse. 

I agree the game was well received from a broad brush perspective, but at the core, the gameplay issues have been talked about since beta.

*I still think it’s a good ass game and I think most people do, the negativity is because it’s not what it could be*
It's true though that when T7 got released, it had technically already been out for a few years to become smooth.

I think a lot will depend on how the tournaments will turn out and how they are received. Can we get anything as hype as T7 tournaments in this game? Hard to say with how volatile the gameplay is. The methodical style of T7 might have its flaws but it made close games much more intense to watch because they lasted longer
    As boring as the overly defensive gameplay was, it actually helped build a lot of tension knowing that something still had to give and the fight would begin in earnest. T8 has virtually none of that suspense and feels more like a Wild West quick-draw showdown.
    Evo is going to be a big test for this games tournament scene. If it's well received the game will keep growing. If not we're in trouble.
I was a nolife gamer for the years where T7 was out and I didn't even know the game existed or had any playerbase

For the most part from what I see Tekken had around 4k active players even in 2016 XD

Yea survived is a good phrase. All I see is current community making sure T8 won't be bought by potentially interested new players for the next 4years
    T7 was a game made with a budget of 3 happy meals and 0 marketing after a failed last game. T8 is coming in with massive marketing and budget +goodwill of the people that it built up in T7 and is looking to end up in the same or worse place than T7 was.
mtx is in the game though so it literally does have things to do with the game. And wtf is this review bombing shit, you think you can convince thousands of people to do what they dot want to do? if the mtx wasn't a problem people wouldn't be reviewing it badly, review bombing doesn't exist especially when you have to buy the game.
Yeah :/ I've kind of dropped the game at this point. Maybe I'll try again after Evo japan, or one of my characters gets announced.
    Sorry bro :(
Then just talk about it though? Why is the presence of some people being negative bad for discussions, while you specifically wanting to disallow people from vocalizing in specific ways healthy?

Either have the discussion or don't, but you can't expect to police how people express themselves when that's exactly what's needed to gauge the state of the game's reception. Both ways.
    Ideally people aren’t affected by other peoples opinions and so whatever ratio of positivity to negativity is how the audience actually feels. In reality whenever the initial reaction to something is extremely negative most people that would have something positive to say, will not want to do so. I’m not acting like this is something that people are willing to fix themselves, i’m just pointing out what’s happening
        Fair enough, not trying to dismiss the validity of newcomers possibly being pushed away. However, having everyone misrepresent their own opinions to match some sort of acceptable range (so long as it's not actual bullying or spreading hate of course) is no more acceptable of a solution than telling more positive minded users to refrain from praising any element until the smoke clears.

With the key point being that positivity only rewards the current state of the game and encourages devs in what many believe to be very incorrect decisions, and just straight up manipulation in some sense, then you're artificially pushing aside negativity that needs to be heard as well. And it's that kind of behavior that causes us to end up with lower quality products, MTX, etc.

Absolutely be positive if you want, praise the elements you like, and I recommend everyone do so, but not to the point where it becomes a toxic positivity circlejerk purely because "that's better than being negative".
well in my opinion it is. heat smash + rage art + power crush heat engagers are cancer. idc what u talkin bout. ur obviously some loser ass nigga who thinks his opinion matters cuz he slightly decent at tekken.
    Lmao you’re such a pussy and that’s evident. Why would anyone care about what someone who is just a whiner and garbage have to say anyway? Your opinion is just stupid. You can’t even speak  your some broke ass uneducated actual loser in everything you do, don’t be mad at me for it
        bruh stop all that yappin lol u claim ur life better than mine so lets prove it. all i said was u being good at tekken was irrelevant to life and you starting goin off on a tangent. must be insecure about some things lol.
            Nah you came up in here on my shit first. If you could read, you’d have noticed I said FROM and then elaborated that I’m from, not IN, meaning I live somewhere else, Baltimore. I see the education quality hasn’t changed there at all. Sad. You’re just another wanna be dime a dozen tough dude when you start realizing you’re saying stupid shit “come and see irl” LMAO anybody saying that shit isn’t scary, can’t fight, and ain’t shit. You’re the insecure one and that’s exactly why you resort to such a stupid thing to say.
                But super congrats on being the dumbest fuck I’ve ever seen in this sub. Don’t get shot in Baltimore trying to be what you ain’t 🤷‍♀️
                bro i said stop all that yappin either prove u on sum or just shut ur monkey mouth. I’m not from baltimore #1 and if you can’t understand what i’m saying that shows how ignorant you are, not me. so once again, stop yappin, you said your life better than mine lets prove it. We in the same area 🤔
Im not dictating what you have an issue with I’m saying it’s not a legitimate issue. You’re just a scrub.
    bro idc what u think i am, u being good at tekken means absolutely nothing in life lol.
        Ah my point. We’re talking about tekken tho so…”hehe you’re good at game but not life” typical last resort when you’re losing an argument. Time to log off scrub. My life is still better than yours too so 🤷‍♀️
            idc about your point lol you called me a scrub, so im telling you. you being good at a video is irrelevant to the grand scheme of life. 😂 and if u from baltimore we can link up and see who life really better 🤔
                From and living in are different things buddy. You ain’t scary pussy
Better call Ar*saul* and Ash.
You did that last one on purpose, didn’t you?
Lil B had waaay more influence than people will ever give him credit for lol
    ya ill contribute to this tangent. i love that man. real ones know
Yeah man he's from Berkeley/Oakland. I remember my friend Natasha now known as Kreayshawn used to shoot videos for Lil B. She began a music career when she saw how easy it was to do music videos and go viral
I have a totally different experience, honestly. Beginners are overly aggressive and tend to mash even when they're heavily under frames or they throw the most unsafe but flashy move. Intermediates tend to keep the distance and approach with safe moves like Jin's ff2 because it is actually a more "thought through" way to play the game. Advanced and pro players usually pick you apart with movement usually using only ultra-safe strings and pokes.
That was a pretty wild ride, wasn't it? Lol. 

  
I hope he doesn't delete the comment chain, that was a hell of a train wreck.
Stay scrubby
    Stay obese and miserable
        project harder
            Why do you talk like an incel?
Just because Tekken 8 is more aggressive doesn’t mean it’s not competitive. And 50/50s always have a degree of risk because if you block the low you are almost always getting combo’s for 70+. You can reduce the amount of 50/50s with good movement. If you do 20 dmg to your opponent and they haven’t done any you can just stand back and force them to come to you. Movement doesn’t work? More like you don’t know how to move. Movement literally got buffed from T7. Homing throws are a bit annoying but you can also just duck. Tekken has always been a mixup oriented game. Most characters aren’t that brainless except for about 5 characters. The game has also been out for only 3 months. T7 had 2 years of balance tweaks before it arrived to console. If any changes need to seriously be made, we’ll see them after Japan EVO once the devs can see what current behavior is busted in competitive play. Especially if they see half the cast play Azu.
    Yeah , i dont know how to move  yet eddy powercrush hit me on his back, and I blocked drag's wr2 when I was litteraly on his back , got hit by Ninas F1+2 when I was on her back and endless similar situations, movement is litteraly trash, and even more trash due to hitboxes being buffed ( the problem is the new hitboxes and not the movement probably). Also some 50/50 are 0 to none risk especially on heat. This game wants you to just throw bs overtuned moves like reinas 3+4,4,4 or victors u1+2 , those with other dozens of braindead "just throw" and hope for the best. Game is currently objectively shit on the competitive scense. Also heatsmashes , the vest just throw and hope for the best, has weird evasiveness and tracking, ghost range, free 5050 on block for snowball, if you manage to step some of them, gl punishing it due to forward momentum, way way too much reward for 0 risk. This game is a joke currently. Its fun though at least not against the top 8 characters.

P.s - dont forget that mr.Murray once said "why would you move when you can just block anf punish" this became real in this game with its casino unescapable 50/50 and random tracking of neutral killing moves like mishimas demon paws, dvj uf1 , lilis df3+4 etc... just random full screen tracking.
        Must powercrushes are steppable. Drag’s WR2 is steppable. Reina’s 3+4,4,4 is annoying but is punishable with a 12f or can get rekt by a well timed mid. Expulsion is literally launch punishable, it just forces crouch so it’s got to be a WS combo. Some of the tracking in the game is a bit rough. Demon Paw is a good example. And aside from characters like Azu and Drag there is a fair amount of counterplay. People love to toss around the term casino but anyone with a strong kbd can force a fair amount of whiffs, or an armor can interrupt some 50/50s.
            Powercrushes are steppable, but everything randomly tacking in this game. Wr2 is steppable too  but why did I block it when I was 180° to the actual diraction?3+4,4,4 -8 on blick and explusion -4 in heat(imo the dumbest buffed move rn, you litteraly have to block it cuz its tracking and full screen) basivclly punishing you for blocking, or even worse, eating a full combo damage from 1 move thats safe.  With all the randomness rng based bs that occures in this game its shit, also when you manage to sidestep a certain move or string the whiff punish may whiff for no reason , there are some consistant interactions, also random camera changes makes a df2 punish into db2 for example, this game is so far from being solid enough to start talking about competitive gameplay.

Ah my point. We’re talking about tekken tho so…”hehe you’re good at game but not life” typical last resort when you’re losing an argument. Time to log off scrub. My life is still better than yours too so 🤷‍♀️
    idc about your point lol you called me a scrub, so im telling you. you being good at a video is irrelevant to the grand scheme of life. 😂 and if u from baltimore we can link up and see who life really better 🤔
        From and living in are different things buddy. You ain’t scary pussy
project harder
    Why do you talk like an incel?
Must powercrushes are steppable. Drag’s WR2 is steppable. Reina’s 3+4,4,4 is annoying but is punishable with a 12f or can get rekt by a well timed mid. Expulsion is literally launch punishable, it just forces crouch so it’s got to be a WS combo. Some of the tracking in the game is a bit rough. Demon Paw is a good example. And aside from characters like Azu and Drag there is a fair amount of counterplay. People love to toss around the term casino but anyone with a strong kbd can force a fair amount of whiffs, or an armor can interrupt some 50/50s.
    Powercrushes are steppable, but everything randomly tacking in this game. Wr2 is steppable too  but why did I block it when I was 180° to the actual diraction?3+4,4,4 -8 on blick and explusion -4 in heat(imo the dumbest buffed move rn, you litteraly have to block it cuz its tracking and full screen) basivclly punishing you for blocking, or even worse, eating a full combo damage from 1 move thats safe.  With all the randomness rng based bs that occures in this game its shit, also when you manage to sidestep a certain move or string the whiff punish may whiff for no reason , there are some consistant interactions, also random camera changes makes a df2 punish into db2 for example, this game is so far from being solid enough to start talking about competitive gameplay.
If you think a corporate lawyer cannot touch you, for an innocent statement like what Knee made, then you haven't met enough of these guy my man. That's all I'm saying. Most lawyers do what they do, to make your life hard, and have you submit. Nothing more than that, they don't even want to go to court.

Anyways, I'm not implying Bamco did anything here. And this pretty much useless discussion has run its course. Its naive you think you can't be sued for something you didn't do. You absolutely can, and a lot of times, even people as big and backed up as international celebrities are made to pay, on a case that has zero merits whatsoever. So unless you live in a state / country with good anti SLAPP laws or some version of it, you're fully liable to be bullied. Its a hard fact to accept, but it goes on every single day around the world.
    I am not saying people don't get frivolous lawsuits. I am saying the threat of a frivolous lawsuit is not there in this situation. There is nothing to work with.
Hmm yes and no. I know what you mean as it is playing smarter but there’s still mashing in how it’s performed. Like with how Eddie is on his debut. Tons of people winning off of lack of knowledge and mashing a single button. When people say button mashing they don’t always mean random inputs. They just means a constant string of inputs.
    But if they still act when it's not their turn, they get punished. Like I said, there's no way mashers survive red, moreso purple.
Nah you came up in here on my shit first. If you could read, you’d have noticed I said FROM and then elaborated that I’m from, not IN, meaning I live somewhere else, Baltimore. I see the education quality hasn’t changed there at all. Sad. You’re just another wanna be dime a dozen tough dude when you start realizing you’re saying stupid shit “come and see irl” LMAO anybody saying that shit isn’t scary, can’t fight, and ain’t shit. You’re the insecure one and that’s exactly why you resort to such a stupid thing to say.
    But super congrats on being the dumbest fuck I’ve ever seen in this sub. Don’t get shot in Baltimore trying to be what you ain’t 🤷‍♀️
    bro i said stop all that yappin either prove u on sum or just shut ur monkey mouth. I’m not from baltimore #1 and if you can’t understand what i’m saying that shows how ignorant you are, not me. so once again, stop yappin, you said your life better than mine lets prove it. We in the same area 🤔
