[[Tekken 8 is a great Tekken game, but that might not be enough - this article is going to age poorly]]


writer of this post says things like Tekken 8 features a "weak cast", and refers to T8's roster as "mushy" (seriously wtf is bro talking about "mushy"?!). then goes on to say the character designs dont convey purpose or personality (the damn picture the article uses is bursting with personality).

Even used Street Fighter 6's Manon of an example of good character design as some sort of slight against Tekken when both games do their own thing quite well; this article rubbed me the wrong way just reads like a fluff piece


This dude actually plays Tekken quite a lot and mains King, [He even made a really good video about getting into fighting games.](https://youtu.be/mCUlBX8E2BU?si=Chgtent8jjdBd8kH)

Also if you read the review he specifically talks about how this might not be the best for newcomers but he himself really enjoys it and is planning on playing it for a long time.
    I don't understand how this game won't be "the best" for newcomers when it has the most indepth training tools of like any fighting game I've ever seen.
        I am worried about T8’s gameplay, as it seems mashy and that the heat stysyem and moves make things very rock paper scissors, but I think they achieved their goal because….

A nine year old nephew tried the demo and was on the verge of karate kicking the house furniture apart and running away to enter the tournament.

All the flashy moves, big hits, rush effects and etc had him wanting to play it pretty hard. I think i am the one confused by all the new stuff instead.
            I think it's going to be a struggle for returning players more than new players. Returning players are going to have to learn to stop playing as Defensive as they have since pretty much forever, while new players won't have that issue.
                Exactly. TMM at first was very annoyed about Kazuya changes, saying how bad he is, but recently came around realising that Kaz is no longer just a turtle and a punish bot. He can actually pressure with some of his tools.
                    I feel like every character is going to be like that once people start learning them. Jin actually looks fun in this game to me and I haven't touched a Mishima at all in Tekken 7.
                        I will smash you with Jin and allow you a rematch and let my 10 year old fight the first round in a bamboozling fashion. It's actually a handicap cos he always loses at my level 🧐

*Crackles with lightning*
                    >TMM

Im new to Tekken. Whats TMM?
                        TheMainManSwe. The Tekken dad. Kazuya main, one of the bigger Tekken streamers and youtubers.
                            gotchu thank you
                It is never going to be a struggle for old players compared to new in Tekken. It still has the bloated move list and you still have years of frame memory and match up knowledge.
                    been punishing fools 25 years brother
                Nobody likes to watch defensive play style even sf6 is more aggressive work the drive system. Granblue versus rising gives you a strong way to break a defense. Defensive is boring to play against and watch.
                    I think a good, solid defense can be a lot of fun to watch when the offensive tools are just as good as the defensive ones. 

but yeah, in fighting games especially a good defense can be a bit boring to watch.
                    Nobody likes to watch mashing play style too.

Tekken so popular exactly because it have working defensive play style.
                        I have yet to see this "mashing play style" in any of the competitive matches I've seen of Tekken 8, the game isn't even out yet and top level players haven't even gotten to play that much. Give it a bit for the actual play style to develop. 

it's so weird seeing this game get praised review wise but suddenly shit on right before release.
                            I want to notice that "mashing play style" is exaggeration when people compare T7 and T8. It's THAT bad, but something many don't like.

If you want to see difference, watch T8 Knee Feng vs T7 Knee Feng  matches.

Like this:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUMmMiE8B3k

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86aeTl2xCQQ

Just compare amount of time characters stay in neutral/bkdish around.
                    I like how you say NOBODY likes it just to make it seem like you have a stronger argument.
                        Can't argue with fighting games becoming more aggressive. Even a card game like Magic The Gathering has taken away slow play styles like draw go control. Overwatch 2 took away the second tank. It's not just fighting games
                    SF6 is a bad game. It is a horrible FG. It is a shite SF game.
                    the only reason i got into tekken 7 and watched it was because of the movement system. i love watching very defensive games, i think thats where the system shines
                Tekken 8 is designed for casuals and people who don't like fighting games. They've ruined the gameplay which explains why its getting high reviews pandering to the noobs who previously were getting destroyed due to the high skill ceiling 
                A very polite way of saying harada fucked it lmao 
                    the game isn't even out yet and you're saying he fucked it? how, elaborate? 

People have been complaining about Tekkens turtle always defend style of gameplay for a while, and Harada listened and tried to make the game more aggressive, and it seems he's succeeded, so how did he fuck up?
                        His ruined it by casualising the game. So many franchises have been ruined for pandering to casuals 
                        > the game isn't even out yet and you're saying he fucked it? how, elaborate?

It's for sure not complete over, but you don't need to be Professor to see how each character got pressure tools. Like more mixups, pluses with heats, and so on.

And you don't need to be a professor to watch matches awaiwable for month, for all ranges of skills, to compare to current tekken. Watch for example Knee Feng in T8, then T7, and tell me pace of the game didn't changed to be much more aggressive.
                            At the end of the day it’s 60 bucks for a game that has mid netcode and none of the stuff that myself or other legacy players like about tekken, we already have tekken 3 rollback that runs perfectly and will hopefully soon see fightcade integration, ppsspp is getting rollback soon so we will have DR, the question is do I want to pay full price for a game I know I won’t like and that isn’t what legacy players want in a tekken game 
                                The question aren't about you (not trying to be rude, just explaining). It's about game alternative.

Mate, look, Tekken 3 can not compete with anything modern. You have to joke to call it playable compared to T7.

T7 might be 'alternative'. In theory. But in practice, it won't have enough players. T7 already was unplayable for solid part of players outside of prime-time, and it will become dead after T8 for sure.

So, there is basically two outcomes. You either doesn't play fighting games at all, or you play T8.
                                    that's not even remotely true. every other franchise has lively legacy scenes. i can get games on SF2X much faster than i could in the last year of tekken, GGAC+R has has a very active player base since it got rollback in 2020. this idea that no one is playing the old game just isn't true. in saying that tekken never had the support street fighter, kof, guilty gear ever had. while capcom, snk and arcsys have been updating legacy games with modern netcode for modern audiences (capcom is barely on this list in fairness) namco have done... nothing. there is no means to play old tekken games until very recently. and still no means for matchmaking outside of discords. this is due to change with fightcade integration but it's a slow process.   


outside of that tekken 3 not being playable ? really ? the game is great. and tag 1 fixed alot of the issues t3 had (at the cost of the balance admittingly.) but it's still really fun with alot of viable characters.. and as already mentioned has better netcode than tekken 8 which is full price. that's the main point. how can namco ask for full price when they haven't even added decent netcode.
                        Because it sucks lmao, drive rush in tekken, backdashing is EVEN WORSE than it is in T7, the balance changes force the game to be much more unga bunga while still not building the game to be actually fun on offense

And even outside of the netcode is confirmed by people with review copies to be bad. Tekken 3 has fluid rollback and there is updates on ppsspp rollback for DR every day. I’m not spending full price for a bad tekken game with bad online when I can play the better ones for free with better netplay 
            Absolutely it worked. Never touched tekken a day in my life, have maybe 100 hours total in 2D fighters. Just hopping on and mashing a bunch of buttons in random order is hella fun. And no I’m not 9 years old
                Do you mash buttons for all fighters?
                    No. I take a couple 2D fighters seriously enough to truly learn and get decent. 3d fighters are not my thing typically but I’ve still had fun with t8 just fucking around with friends without really trying too much. Basically I’m the target audience of their changes I guess was the point
                This game is designed for Fortnite braindead kiddies rather than Tekken fans. If you just wanna bash buttons then go ahead and enjoy. I'm sticking with Tekken 7 which actually requires skill
                    Tekken 8 has a lot of depth, just like Tekken 7. You are allowed to dont like the changes. But to say that it requires no skill... is just wrong and stupid. Doesnt make any sense at all.
            It seems to offer a lot more accessibilities to new player for sure. However, apart from pulling off cool looking moves from a fluke here and there, I say that's as good as any new comers will ever be.

Saying this as someone who hasn't played since TTT. Almost 20 years lol. I CAN mash buttons and pull off some nice moves but on my first day on demo I can't even beat the arcade mode lol. I had to look up poking games and relearn some combos to make progression.
                Most new comers won't stay that's true, it's going to be the same thing it always is, dedicated new players who decided to try and learn the game. That won't change, they just have more tools to do so in the full game from my understanding.
            I had the same worries until I watched some PhiDX commentary on T8 matches. He’ll clearly state that a match is a good T7 match or T8 match, depending on how the competitors utilize the new mechanics. So now I have a good grasp on when to use my heat, how to retain it and use it to its full potential.
        Newcomers and casuals are typically not in it for labbing or the grind to get better.

They're usually in it for at least three other more common reasons -- flavor of the month/popularity, lore/immersion, and appreciation of aesthetics and archetypes.

Lore is too complicated and a soft reset doesnt stop people from wondering what happened to get to this point.

Character archetypes are also wildly all over the place. Jack8 doesnt even look like a military deployed musclebot, Victor is gonna confuse the fuck outta people, we have a bear wearing a headband that presumably knows karate, and no one outside of the Tekken Universe can explain why King/Armor King communicates exclusively in cat growls.

Tekken 8 is very much a refinement, but it's also in the same unapologetic personality camp as DMC5 where if you don't vibe with it, then you just won't get it or get into it.
            this is how i interpret the opinion too. you cannot change the challenge of getting people to commit to learning something which is niche.

having tools to learn more smoothly and quickly is really great, but you have to already want to use the tools for it to matter. something people who are totally new to the genre probably don't care about.

people are much too quick to dismiss opinions that find any fault.
        Theres been a really good Guilty Gear Tutorial mode, i dont remember wich one.  
I think XRD. They were arguably Top tier material too, but you probably cant compare the two based on how differently both games play.
            Strive has awesome tutorials. They could be more in-depth for certain mechanics but the fact that they have one for Kara cancels and other character specific tricks is pretty neat.
                ye i didnt mean strive, i think it was xrd
        ? Tekken 8s training tools are basic from what ive seen.

Arc sys work games have the best tutorial from at least GG: rev2
            The Training mode is really good, with the ability to reset during actions to train for specific set ups and the normal training mode things. the replay system gives you tips for how to improve mid replay and even lets you play through parts of the replay to help you learn how to handle a situation better. 

the arcade mode thing also teaches you the game as you play. I've never played Rev 2, and I don't doubt it has a really good training mode. 

But again, based on the limited fighting games i've played (SF5, SF6, MK1, MK11, Injustice 2, Soul Calibur 6, DBFZ, GGStrive, BBTag) it has the best training *tools* of any fighting game i've seen.
                Sorry, i misinterprated tools for beginners learning.

Yeah, youre right everything is there for a great system
                    My bad for typing it the way I did; I think some people thought I meant the lab/training mode/combo practice when I meant everything the game throws at new players.
        if nothing else it'll be the best newcomer experience a fresh tekken player could have
        Not to mention that “special style” stuff and the fact it has way more single player content for casuals than the last two Tekken games.
        the ghost fights were all i needed baby
        This game is deffo better for newcomers. As one myself, I played the demo and both Beta’s and can say I avidly enjoyed my time, especially ranking up way higher than I did in 7. The gameplay feels much smoother and not as slowed or delayed, while keeping you thoroughly engaged. Plus the characters I did play in 7 got some changes to their inputs in 8 (Lars being a good example) so it made my experience better.
        >when it has the most indepth training tools of like any fighting game I've ever seen.

I feel like that doesn't attract or retain as many players as FGC would like to believe.

It mostly comes down to whether or not a player can attach themselves to the game in some way and be okay with losing.

Problem with Tekken is that the formula largely remained the same over the years so the catch up game is a lot harder + a lot of the characters end up playing fairly similarly until you need to get to pinnacle levels with them, so new players end up getting bopped all day long.

Tekken is oddly way more fun than most other games when played casually and locally for new comers I feel like. It's the only game I've seen bunch of kids play at a house party with girls, it's the only game I've seen bunch of salarymen play with yakuza looking guys in random ass arcade in Japan laughing and having fun.
    The fact that he's a King player says it all.
    The only issue I see so far is this broken matchmaking system. It makes zero sense because even if you choose the +/- 2 lvls which is the lowest option, you can fight the most difficult person ever, or win a match 3-0 twice no problem.
I’m fully expecting to be downvoted on this take of mine but here goes:

I agree with the essence of the criticism that Tekken can struggle to convey characters personality as well as its peers. Sometimes they hit it out of the park and other times you get a Leo, a Shaheen and Asuka etc. I can tell you as someone who spends a lot of time outside of the Tekken community, when I show friends and family different fighting games. They tend not to be anywhere near as interested in the characters at a glance. 

This isn’t to say it’s a total failure but I do count its characterisation as weaker than its peers. I know it’s subjective but that’s my take. I could probably expand on this further but it’s probably not worth the time.

As for the rest of the article yeah, didn’t age super well lol.
    I mean Leo does convey character, just not an interesting one. And he does that well.

It's your classic, naive and simple minded shonen protagonist that can do anything if he believes in it. I find that uninteresting aswell, but you cant say he doesnt convey this character pretty well. Like Gon from HxH or something.

Shaheen i find harder to describe too though, especially since he started surfin on people. 

(And now we have a character whose whole personality is Coffee.. xD)
    Absolutely agree. Over the years, I came to appreciate Tekken's overall more grounded character design. Apart from the obvious Yoshimitsu, bears, kangaroos and whatnot, I'd say that a newcomer seeing the cast for the first time would have a harder time remembering who is who compared to say MK, Street Fighter and Guilty Gear.
    Brave of you to voice this opinion. I agree with you. +1
    Yup, completely agree. It’s not even that the characters are bad exactly, just that a lot of them are uninspiring and that’s one of the flaws of having a lot of characters and having an overall more realistic theme when it comes to designs and play styles. It worked out well in the early games because of the lack of characters, but not so much when the roster grows. 

Fighting games are the main games I play, and I play mostly all of them. I’m that one guy that always invites friends or coworkers over and make them play with me, and the only people that want to play Tekken are the people who already like it or grew up with it because they see the cast and only a few of them stand out in their eyes. Street Fighter nails it since their whole thing is playing off of stereotypes and having exaggerated features, Mortal Kombat always had color coding, elements, and throwing on identifiable features for the characters that can’t fit that, like Kotal being green and obviously Aztec, Baraka having spikes, Kenshi with the blindfold, Raiden with the straw hat and glowing eyes, and so on. Dead or Alive is just pick the one that’s most attractive to you. Guilty Gear has all the characters looking unique. Killer Instinct and Darkstalkers tells you exactly what a character is like because they’re horror and fantasy themed. Bloody Roar has the animals. Soul Calibur has the weapons. Samurai Shodown has the weapons and outfits. Marvel’s got the name recognition. 

All these games have things that make their characters stand out from one another and makes many of them recognizable to people who aren’t fully into them, but then there’s Tekken with only a handful of characters where you could just give a short description of the character for others to know, like the samurai, the leopard guy, the robot, old guy with the eagle hair, guy with the wings, little Chinese girl, bear, while a lot of them require you to say more. 

I love Tekken, it’s my second favorite fighting game right behind Bloody Roar, but it’s tough trying to get people into it since the cast isn’t full of “fun” or “cool” looking characters unless you actually watch how they all play where most people also aren’t going to be able to differentiate a lot of them
        I said this to the initial comment, but this is why guest characters matter. Nobody outside of tekken is ever going to pick up T8 because of idk Jins new design. You cant sell characters like that to players that arent already fans, they dont know jin so they wont care how he looks or how awesome he now plays. But you show them a character from a franchise they know like noctis and negan and all of a sudden their ears perch up.

I am just saying if tekken 8 becomes "the cool fighting game that has Tifa in it" (for example) for people outside of the community that's when it will become huge.
        Its gonna be interesting how Tekken 8 sells. It panders to casuals that don't like the game 
    Also is it me or is tekken a giant sausage fest
        That and the women that exist tend to (with some notable exceptions) be far more homogeneous than the men.
        *You got a bunch of men locked up,*

*in a warm place...*

  * All of em' get hard;
  * All of em' horny;
  * All of em' gots sexual desires.

*So what are you gonna do?*

***You won't let em' have a woman;***

*they gonna have each-*

***Listen, man;***

*somebodies gonna have to give up some booty,*

*and its just that simple.*
    definitely agree.
    This is a fantastic way to look at it. I think op is lookin at this as a sort of black and white or you're with us or against us sort of mentality. It doesn't have to only be perfect or only be terrible
    I agree.  Outside of the core characters a lot of the rest are just there, and even with the core cast sometimes it struggles.
    I am a newcommer to the game, and i can see your point as to struggling to convey characters personalities.Half the fighters in the game practice "Karate A, Karate B, Karate C" and that can sometimes feel a little bland, but then you suddenly see "Wrestling, Capoeira, Kempo\*1, Taekwondo".However King and Armor King who are supposed to be very Flamboyant dont have any facial expressions due to their big masks, their Capoeira fighter is a DLC character, their Kempo fighter is ->in my opinion<- the most vanilla looking fighter in the game\*2.

I get your point, but they add so much spice through exceptional movement tech, deep movelists and INSANE graphic design that i simply dont see how something like street fighter and guilty gear can compete in their current state.My main concern is casuals playing through campaign and jumping online to be absolutely smashed by Tekken Gods playing mishimas. Imaine going online to play for fun and being absolutely wrecked by wavedashing and animation canceling.

\*1 i know Kempo is technically Karate\*2 Fengs costume seleciton are in my opinion 4 recolors of the same outfit, and a suit. Why dont they do like they did with Reina and give him a Samurai outfit? He practices THE samurai fighting style. Imagine feng in full edo period armor.
    as a character design enthusiast I completely agree. but as an overall game, I think Tekken 8 far more superior than SF6 and MK1 when it comes to mechanic, modes, features, roster variety options and gameplay
        In terms of mechanics I’d probably give it to SF6 as of right now. The interaction of all the systems of SF6 work very well with each other and lead to a lot different scenarios.There are so many offensive mechanics, but balanced out by defensive mechanics like the parry, classic FG strategies like throwing fast pokes to interrupt, throws and the classic wake up super. 

For T8 it’s going to take a while to see how the new mechanics mix with each other like chip damage, the rally mechanics, and heat mode. We’ve already seen a lot of vitriol opinions on the changes and honestly it might even get more hard to tell because most people posting on the sub Reddit are online warriors. And with online we have issues like the rollback not actually being rollback, and cross play with PC with a super demanding game when we know not everyone has a beefy PC. Even games like Strive and SF6 which work on potatoes have people going in without an optimized PC and making online a nightmare to play sometimes.
        Really? Im looking forward to t8 but I have yet to see more/better modes and features than sf6. At best its paralel at worse just a bit behind.
            There are more game modes I think
                SF6 has 35 combinations of match types from extreme battle alone. Add that to different variations of team battle, regular battle, avatar battles and the retro game cabinets.
    You have an upvote.  Has been a tekken fan since Tekken 1 release.
    I can see Tekken's character designs being reserved compared to SF, though that's not necessary a detriment. It's just like how SF would possibly be reserved compared to...skullgirls
    I wonder how they'd respond to the earlier games like 1-4 where the presentation of these games was more accessible to regular people who may or may not play games.
    To be honest with you, I'd rather have more grounded characters like Asuka and Leo (they have a personality but not flamboyant) instead of caricatures like Ken, Ryu, Juri, Dee Jay etc.
        Yeah this mostly comes down to preference. If we assume however, that most if not all fighting games are trying to create instantly appealing, iconic designs. Then that approach just won’t deliver on that goal, plus I never felt like they fleshed out the more naturalistic characters enough to justify that trade off (though I know that’s very subjective).
    While I do agree with your take your examples are a bit weird. T8 asuka is a huge improvement in terms of character and expression compared to T7 where she was already one of the more popular characters. But yeah, with some characters they did a really great job both visually and in terms of pushing their personality within their gameplay (the mishimas, jun lars, zafine and more), for others they did a really basic job (lee, shaheen, leo, steve etc).

However the article mentions this in context with getting outsiders into the franchise. Which has never been done with the "regulars" but always with a mixture of the overall visuals and feel of the game - tekken just looks incredible - and guest characters.

A lot of tekken 8s success will hinge on whether or not we get good guest characters. The stuff that casual video game magazines write articles about to land tekken in their periphery. Leo and shaheen were never going to grab the attention from anyone outside of tekken. T7 did a pretty good job with guest characters, if we stay on that level or even surpass it that's going to determine the influx of new players.
Initially I was going to say it's another game journalist who doesn't know what they're talking about, but after actually reading the article, I actually agree with most of his points. Actually, most of those very complaints have appeared in this sub-reddit at one point in time. The male characters all have similar body types and certain ones (like Law) would look more unique with a smaller and leaner physique. At first glance, the female characters' faces seem to lack the range of personality of their male counterparts. And I personally think Victor could have benefited from less 'design' for lack of a better term. 

That being said, I still think T8's roster is brilliant as there is most likely at least one or 2 (or 7-8 in my case) characters that will most likely appeal to someone trying to choose a main. While there may be nitpicks with the designs, the fighting styles are all so unique and that is a huge achievement with a 32 character roster.
    Yeah, 7 at least had Fahkumran and Bob which had quite a different visual appeal. 

In 8 everyone is overly buff and every female is identical body wise(and what's up with faces being so unexpressive and doll like ugh), which is kinda sad. 

Im most disappointed in art direction of hwoarang tho, like why is he so wide and why did he suddenly got his shoulders and hands so big, he's a taekwondo fighter ffs.
    If Victor didn’t have that sword he’d be near perfect for me aesthetically
    i think a way to visualize it for folks is to look at SF 6 and the avatar system. lets say you make the generic jumpsuit guy and give him all of Cammy's moves. without question, you'll know its cammy. same goes for loading a Blanka Moveset, Gief move set etc.

now imagine tekken with a similar avatar system. you have generic man in jumpsuit with Kazuyas move set. then Jin's, then asukas, then lars. i'd wager most people who aren't already fans will struggle to identify whos who.
        That was always the fun of mokujin vs mokujin battles back in the day. Whoever could figure out their opponent's character (as well as their own) first had the huge advantage. Of course some tekken characters have really unique neutral stances (i.e. Eddy, Law) so sometimes it was a dead give away
I actually agree with a lot of the article. love tekken but it can def improve in some areas
    For sure!
Hes not wrong. Most characters in tekken lack the depth of personality. Some designs in tekken are too ''safe'' or just flatout boring to look at.
Idk lil bro, the roster is lookin kinda mushy to me
    No GOAT (Marduk) or Lei is crazy 


And putting Fahk at DLC AGAIN is even crazier. 


He has to be in the game given his popularity..
Tbh I think they went too much into realism for some aspects and removed certain things that made characters iconic. Sure Paul looks more realistic now but his hair was recognisable across genres and a big part of his silhouette. Imo gameplay & graphics look better but character designs feel like a slight downgrade and a lot of them blend into each other.

Anyway, my main Lili is a definitive upgrade so I'm happy but I can see how other players would be slightly disappointed because their mains' aesthetics have been changed for to fit a more modern Tekken theme.
People are just gonna be like "REEEEEE Polygon" but I think his opinions are well reasoned and explained.

Tekken's character designs have long failed to find the sweet spot between too many ideas and not enough. Characters that just seem like a mishmash of disparate concepts next to the likes Shaheen & Katarina who are some of the least interesting characters to ever grace the genre.

Complaints about diversity in body type are well-founded IMO, SF6's three female newcomers alone showed a more interesting range of silhouettes than Tekken's entire 30 year roster. Their different body types all reflected their gameplay and helped convey their personalities.

As for the rest of the review it all seems pretty standard. He likes the core gameplay, seems like the cinematic story but acknowledges it isn't really anything we haven't seen before. Arcade Quest seems is alright for what it is, but it was never going compare particularly favorably compared to SF6's World Tour so I'm not shocked to hear that here.

Also anyone saying "well you can just customize them to whatever you want", that's a cop out and you know it. It's no replacement for good character design that reflects and reinforces the characters personality and gameplay.
    Feng Wei Slowly Getting worse and worse default designs actually pisses me off
    >Also anyone saying "well you can just customize them to whatever you want", that's a cop out and you know it. It's no replacement for good character design that reflects and reinforces the characters personality and gameplay.


Big agree there.  Personally I massively prefer to use sick looking default/presets over customizations.  Super customized characters feel like they lose a ton of personality to me.
Tekken characters have had little depth, personality, or development since like Tekken 6. Every old character has gotten flanderized and every new character is given nothing to work with. I say this as someone that used to be drawn to Tekken by the amount of subtle personality that was built into characters.
As much as I love the series, its character designs are not its strong point. "Mushiness" is a weird way to describe it but I get it in comparison to SF6's more unique roster. I think the author has a strong point and you not touching on anything in the second half of the review suggests you might be a bit biased.

I'm super excited for T8 but I don't see this review aging poorly. In fact I think it's a pretty good summary of Tekken's current identity.
    I think this isn't just neccessarily the designs but also simply the amount of characters. It's just way harder to have 32 characters be unique especially if you are forced to include the entire mishima bloodline due to story reasons vs SF6s 18 character roster.

I could easily make tekken 8s roster look as unique as the one from SF6 if I could chose 18 particular characters.

I will say though SF in general does a good job at having their characters double as marketing tools by having their bodies look like they do. They are fairly unapologetic when it comes to using the female characters to draw in an audience while T8 on that front is fairly homogenous. If you were to turn off the natural fighting stance and just show me the silhouette of the female fighters I would have a hard time telling who is who. I dont even play SF6 and I could easily tell with that game. Normally I would say it makes sense since T8 has a more grounded artstyle however in T8 all of the male characters having humanly impossible muscles so I feel like they missed an opportunity here. The thin/fat and in case of girls muscular/sexy body type is completely missing.
        The problem is every single female characters have the same body. Like someone else said in the thread as. 3 female characters from sf6 have more diversity in their designs than all of tekken 8 female characters and I love the game .

Someone made a video with the bodies of women from different sport files at an Olympic level and they all look different and easy to distinguish. They just wanted to make attractive characters
            Yepp this is true. Someone else mentioned that this is for customization purposes which makes sense but begs the question if we should sacrifice that sort of body diversity for the sake of having our bread costume not clip through our character :/
                Especially when we can’t even have t6 costumes. I was so excited damn
        idk why the launch roster of SF6 got a pass while missing chunks of the og roster. i know its explained by lore but regardless every single character from SF2 should have be present
            I don't think SF fans care about legacy characters as much. You can point out how small the SF6 roster is, meanwhile they will point out how little of T8 is new characters.
Nah, he makes a really solid point. I was not interested in Tekken at all from the odd glances I got at promotional material early on because none of the characters interested me from the outset. A majority of the cast are so overly designed to the point where they start to blur into a mess of high tech armour and leather coats. Nothing about them felt distinct and I never got a sense of personality from most of the cast outside of the rare cases like King (but King is such a perfect design that its hard to go wrong). Me and my friends jokingly thought Tekken 8 looked like one of those original royalty free games you'd see being played in the background of movies because most of the male cast just give off that generic early 2000s edge vibe. If it wasn't for Lili's distinctly cute aesthetic I was most likely gonna skip this game. Thanks to Manon for giving me a pavlovian affinity for haughty French women too.
    Just being pedantic, but, while Lili does speak french, Lili is actually from Monaco. She is also canon to the Digimon franchise for some reason.
        All rivers return to the sea and all cultures love AGUMON
    >most of the male cast just give off that generic early 2000s edge vibe. If it wasn't for Lili's distinctly cute aesthetic I was most likely gonna skip this game.

I would've agreed with you if you hadn't said this.
        Thats actually his strongest point lol. Tekken has always had the outdated early 2000s vibe
            That's when TK was at its best. When the character designs were based on certain properties from the 80s, 90s, and early 2000s. But since T6, they've just been putting anything and everything in a blender like it's generic modern anime.
                Honestly Tekken has barely evolved from Tekken 1. Its literally the same game with better graphics. The problem is they have barely chabfed it enough not that they are trying everything 
    Azucena doesnt interest you at all? ive never mained a female character in a fighting game before but she'll be my first for sure; such an enjoyable personality to contrast Kazuya,Jin,Bryan etc being dead serious during fights
        Azucena interests me for sure, but that's more based on the promotional videos on her rather than just purely her design. While she does have personality, none of that really shows through in her visual design. She's just wearing a generic gym outfit with a jacket with minor South American vibes.

The problem with Tekken cast is that while they have a lot of backstory, only people who have played the games for a decade are going to be familiar with that. All the newcomers are going to see are images of the fighters and I don't really know how you could make more bland characters than a lot of the Tekken cast. You'd be hard pressed to make any correct assumptions on the personality or fighting style of "buff dude #5 in a leather trenchcoat". 

Now contrast with something like Street Fighter 6, where almost every character design is bursting with personality to the point of being caricature-like: You can take a good guess about their personality and fighting style based on a single promotional image alone. There are some standouts in Tekken too, like King obviously, but they're definitely in the minority.

And this is coming from a place of very, very deep love for Tekken. It's a flawed gem of a series that sometimes tends to ride a bit too hard on brand name recognition alone and not enough innovation or effort trying to bring in new people. Tekken's barrier of entry with the huge roster and gigantic move lists is already high, boring the bejesus out of newcomers is the last thing they should do.
            Ryu,Ken and Luke burst with personality? major reason i skipped SF6 was all the og characters just look aged and not much else. all the new characters however are totally unique and interesting imo
        >Azucena doesnt interest you at all? 

Are we not in agreement that she is a poorly designed? Visually her main outfit is extremely boring and her personality is essentially a meme. I dont mind her existence but there is no way she is grabbing the attention from outsiders. Well I guess none of the 3 new characters do.
            yeah noticing a divide here i wasnt aware of all the new characters from Vincent to Azucena look really good to me didnt know people thought they were boring
                They are not boring to me, but if I was a tekken outsider none of them would catch my eyes at all. They are unknown characters that dont seem very exciting.
        Man, I despise Azucena. Maybe I'm old, but she's kinda a cringe, cheap gen z Fortnite dance single note meme character. To each their own, though, obviously
        Azucena mixup machine with very annoying sounds probably a reason to drop game, not play it.
        Oh yeah Azucena does interest me too and her inclusion does show that the team are on the right track of making more distinct characters. But then you also have Victor who encapsulates all the problems I have with Tekken designs too so it's a step forward and a step back.
Least retarded tekken fan, stop malding. the Polygon guy is surprisingly correct on most of his takes.
    some good takes, some awful ones.
He meant mushy in the sense that their personality and style aren't well-defined and captivating, they don't convey immediately who they are and why they're interesting to a newcomer.
It’s better than MK1 at least
Remember guys: first impressions aren't everything.
Sorry to say this but newcomers will drop this game hard.

It's just too much for newcomers.
    For newcomers Tekken is fun when they play locally with friends of equal noobness. 

Otherwise this game is kinda hard to grasp. Among my group of friends, the only ones enjoying Tekken are the ones who played since Tekken 3 and one guy who is ultra competitive. 

They do enjoy ufc tho, which I find as boring as the game can get, while also not being an easy to pick up discipline.
    Its way more casual friendly then 4 or 6..
Im not gonna open the link, but claiming a game you dont have access to yet is perfect and will remain it, is just mindless simping. This guy has actually played the full game, unlike us
The writer was on the money and he’s right saying the roster is not very good.
    Roster is not very good ? The fuck man enlighten me how can the roster be good 
Heihachi died except him who are we missing
        Nah I agree. The roster itself in terms of size is great, but it is missing the certain something. We have no new character that stands out for non-tekken players and the ones we have are just....too many mishimas/karate-type characters. Characters with different fighting styles and body shapes are missing, such as Bob, Lei, wang.

It's not a big problem for me because tekken is and always will be my fighting game, but the reason for that has never been the roster tbh and I feel like if we want to keep the popularity going that we started to get with T7 with need some more oomph in the roster. Hopefully the dlc characters can fix this AND - I know oldasses dont want to hear this - have those characters not be marduk, anna and AK who all have similar characters already in the game and are unmarketable to the non-tekken crowd.

Lets bring those characters in after T8 is buzzing due to having completely wild guests like T7 did.
        Iconic characters with an unique fighting style I'd say. There is too much "Karate A, Karate B".
So characters like Lei, Marduk, Eddy/Christie, and Josie/Bruce would make the base roster look more attractive.

If we had to remove characters then cramp the bears into 1 slot. Still crazy to think that they're excluding so many great fighters. Then remove devil Jin and make him unlockable or dlc. Or become devil Jin in-game when you make a special move like with Kazuya. 

And we could also get a 3rd free slot if we remove Lars. He is just a sad excuse for swedish representation. And the game really doesn't need this many Mishimas. We can't both have Lars and Jun, so pick your poison Harada.

Fit in Lei's drunken boxing, Eddy's dancing, and some Kickboxing figther and I would personally be sold on the roster alone.
        The trash ass characters like Lei, Christie, Wang. Only actual good characters missing are Marduk, Anna, and Julia.
            Since when is Lei a trash character?  Lol.
            Lei is an iconic charecter that I don't know why they always put in dlc
    what would make the roster better? im blown away with how they've managed to bring nearly everyone back to Tekken 8 without factoring in the waves of dlc coming. as far as character design ok fair enough you can have that conversation as they did make some changes people arent vibing with. as far as comparing it to Street Fighter 6 roster though thats a joke. launch SF6 is missing *quite* a few characters (i only bring this up because article writer brought it up)
        Quanity doesn't make everything. SF6 has fewer characters, but provides the most depth any of those characters have ever had in the series, thus offering different methods and ways to play each one. It's a perfect balance of quantity and quality, making matchups far more easier to learn and creating one of the most balanced vanilla fighting games in history. They worked the roster from the ground up whilst Tekken's changes to their veteran characters aren't as significant in comparison, especially animation wise, though that's a nitpick, it plays a factor with reviewers like the one in the top post.
Its different rules for casuals. It doesn't matter how much the Tekken players themselves love or hate the game, casual players have their own perception of it which isn't affected by us. If they don't like it for any reason, sensible or not, there's nothing we can do about it.
    only learning this now lol, didnt know the new character designs werent recieved well🤧
One of the things that sticks out to me is Azucena, she doesn't have any expressions at all.  
Whenever she appears on screen she just has that flat expression despite having the energetic dancing motions.

Little touches bring life. I think it's a reason I started liking Alisa in TK7, her mannerisms are given a comedic and extra amount compared to most others which makes her memorable along with her robotic stand out features.

Lee has gotten SO much more style, comedy and life to him, just a shame his default look makes him blend into the background rather than cut a strong silhouette. Even the mask hides his face so the only part of the design you can easily see is his silver hair.
Tekken character designs have been going the way of overdesign since 7. That’s honestly my one complaint with these games. They need to tone it the fuck down. Other than that I can’t speak to the rest of this article
I would get downvoted into oblivion for this but wtf is wrong with the lighting in this game? Like it looks ugly, honestly.
That review reads very fair and favorable to Tekken 8.

Unless you expect: Tekken 8 is the best and without flaws.
I can see where the criticism about character design is coming from but I think for Tekken 8, the new main costumes, and some of the other new and returning ones fit and sell their character pretty well e.g. Lili's frilly dresses and tops, Asuka's new fashionable uniform, hakama and boy-ish outfits, Nina's revealing yet fashionable outfits, Kazuya's intimidating corporate suits and coats, Lars' military/royalty inspired outfits, Reina's modern, sleek combat outfit just to name a few. It's impressive that long running fighting games like SF and Tekken can still pump out cool ass characters.
    not even factoring in im quite sure every character is entirely customizable; they can wear their original outfits or a custom fit (hopefully works for competitive too), so the points the article makes about how he doesnt like Pauls new hair, or Lee's new battle suit will likely be non issues for launch
OP doesn't agree with review of game he loves unconditionally.

Oh no.
    jumping to conclusions like that is wild. he "reviewed" the graphics by saying SF6 looks better lmao no
        Sorry, where exactly does he say that?
            "While Street Fighter 6 seemed to take joy in rendering all kinds of exaggerated, athletic silhouettes, Tekken 8’s men all share a handful of bodies on the spectrum"

using terms like "rendering"  in the context of character graphical design is a comparison between the two graphically

substitute SF6 for MK1 in the article and it would be a low blow idk why its different here, tekken is realistic while sf6 goes for a stylized toon look shouldnt be compared at all
                He makes a very specific comparison between one element of each games character design sensibilities, youre reaching to say he was making any kind of overall statement about either games graphics. But sure tell everyone else not to jump to conclusions.
        Honest question based on your take, and I am aware many agree with you... But, I spent an hour last night switching back and forth between SF6 and Tekken 8 on PS5. To my eyes, SF6 animations appeared remarkably more fluid, and the textures more polished, crisp, less grainy, higher framerate (which I don't think is true but describes my perception). What am I missing
            street fighter 6 has way less going on then Tekken; not saying this results in a better game because SF6 offers an extremely quality experience with smooth animation like you mentioned. Tekken has to factor in destructible environments, fully interactable 3-D range, character textures change at a very detailed level throughout the battle as they take physical damage to body and clothing, the scope of the backgrounds (sf6 has a fully animated background as well but not like t8 with an entire cityscape in the background or planets moving). 

style, fluidity,smooth, these are the words that come to mind for SF6, while T8 for me is scale, detail, and realism (not saying SF6 doesnt have all these traits and again its frustrating author brought up SF6 as his example of whats "good" because they really both did an amazing job)

as far as how many people agree with me its really not the mob of blind support you'd expect with a massive launch like T8, many here expressed good opinions on why its not the perfect game id made it out to be and thought it was. id say its around a 50/50 split on positive vs negative based on the feedback. its been a while
        Oh no, you don't agree with someone else's opinion.
            all right great contribution thx 🙄
        Bro, reread your post.
            we're talking about graphics what conclusions am i jumping to lmao the game objectively has a better graphic system.
Players have been criticizing the designs for a while, some are just too blind to see it. Sure, the girls are pretty, but they’re all basically the same character. All the dudes are mr olympia contenders. 

Its not something that ruins the game ofc. But it’s something I can see some potential players can find off putting
The character designs absolutely did take a hit in 8 in my opinion. The DLC redesigns in 7 were slam dunk after slam dunk, so I thought that was kind of a preview of what they were going with 8. Instead everything is pretty mediocre with a few standouts where you can say they've improved compared to 7 (Hwoarang is probably the best example) and some disasters like Paul. Hell, even Reina, which is one of the coolest new characters in a while is extremely generic design-wise.

The game is only out since yesterday and Manon (and A.K.I.) are the ugliest characters I've ever seen.
    A.K.I is actually great   
she fits SF so well yet she is too different
I’m trying to decide if I want this game or not and I cannot seem to make up my mind, lol. I never got into Tekken as a teenager, so my gameplay knowledge is almost zero. But, I love fighting games in general and I’d like something else to play when I’m not on SF6. My main hesitation comes from whether or not I’m going to like it enough to stick with it and actually dedicate time to learning everything. I heard Tekken is not the most newcomer friendly series, so that’s also a concern. I definitely don’t wanna just mash buttons, as I’m pretty competitive and I’d get no enjoyment from pulling off a lucky win that way. Can anyone who’s played it recommend it for a total newcomer, and offer an estimation on how long it would take to learn enough to be competitive?
    tekken 8 is objectively the most newbie friendly title in the series; so many training mechanics to teach the basics, as far as when you'll be compeditively viable id say a year of casual play should have you ready
        Thanks for the reply. It’s good to hear that there’s a robust training mode, because I’ll certainly need it, haha. A year isn’t so bad in the grand scheme of things. I’ll just have to be patient, remember to learn from my opponents, and take it one step at a time.
Tekken 8 is great for online but it sucks the story. Developers lazy ass writing and to think of anything clever other than a Mosuo-style scene....and the ending is fucking beyond frustrating on Hard or above with the unreal blocking and most of all repetitive fights....literally 10 times? I am so done with the Tekken story right now, I only wish the entire fucking planet explodes and ends this goddamn drawn-out story.

nooby trashcan gameplay
tekken characters are hit or miss. some are amazing and other have me like "yep thats definetly a character with an anime aesthetic".
It’s a Polygon article, those guys don’t even have any sort of integrity
    Do you even know the person who wrote the article?
    The dude that wrote this review is an actual Tekken player and fighting gamer. The review is solid.
    I got nothing against Polygon. I know they tend to skew more towards casual games but I don't hold that against them.
I don’t get his comment about Lee. Big deal he has a combat suit. His old costume is still in the game.
    because it doesnt suit his flamboyant character one bit
    as far as futuristic battle suits i liked Lee's new costume 🤷‍♂️
Man people talking on the behalf of "new players" or made up audiences is getting tiring.
Yet you felt a need to share so badly...
    glad i did as the article aged horribly
I miss the older, more normal, more relatable characters. They seemed more inspired, like they actually had "character"


Now everyone's just a super flashy robot (literally) and it just looks tacky. Sure, Kazuya does look good, but his rage art is so wack it almost negates his cool look.


Then there's robot Lee . Just ugh.


Nina looks like shit tbh. The short hair just makes her look too much like a soccer mom.


Wtf did they do to Paul?


Why does Law look like that dude in YouTube who eats bull testicles for every meal? Wtf is that juice monkeys name again anyway? Law is supposed to be like a small, agile Bruce Lee.


I dunno. I totally get it when people complain about the characterization and the direction it's going in.


It's like . The game lost its heart and soul, and traded it in for flashy gimmicks. I'm okay with Kazuya, Jin, Lilli tho I guess.


But overall I still can't get into loving this game. It's just too fast paced and mashy. It's very much an aggressive in your face mixup hard read game now. Pokes and footsies and wiff punishes are basically dead, and that really sucks. 


Ive watched lots of pro T8 games now and it just reinforced how I already feel... So I'll check things out again in a few months time.
He's right

I'm super hyped for this game but, half the characters look incredible, half look eh.

Female faces too generically similar (no idea why this some sort of culture war in this sub), males are too hyper-shredded across the board.  Azucena's entire personality revolves around coffee, Victor is a bit messy, and while Reina is more interesting personality wise she again sports the same oval face and generic body type.  Why they brought back Shaheen, and then proceeded to do NOTHING to make him more interesting, completely boggles the mind.

SF6 brought in Manon, Marisa, Luke, Jamie, Kimberley, JP, Lily.  I'd say the majority of those maybe minus Luke and Lily, have really interesting aesthetics.
Manon is a terrible character lmao
Bet that guy mains Lucky Chloe
    From what it looks like in the video link posted above, it does look like he might be a Lucky Chloe main, which is hilarious that you say this lol.
I personally like the design of Tekken characters way more than SF, especially as the years go on. Look at Victor. A supremely cool silver fox special agent with CQB skills.

Compare to a character like Lily...a poor man's T-Hawk wearing a fruity looking beanie and bashing you with wooden paddles.

Or compare Abel to Dragunov... both are Sambo practitioners. But one is a poor man's young Fedor Emelianenko and one is a badass soldier ghoul with ice in his veins. Abel throws people around like he's in a Loony Tunes skit and Drag performs legit armbars and kneebars.

Don't get me started on heinously ugly characters like Hakan and Abigail. 

SF character design peaked in SSF2 for me. Vega, Bison, Balrog, Guile...all badass designs that are hard to top. The SF designs over the years get fruitier and more cartoonish without being cooler. Harada obeys the rule of cool.
    Tekken does a fantastic job with the male characters. Oodles of personality, ages, looks, just a ton of variety and something for everyone. 

I think Street Fighter probably does a better job with the female characters. The Street Fighter female characters have more varied personalities, looks, ages and sizes etc. Tekken plays it super typical Japanese with the female characters, young flawless looking characters with a peppy personality. There are a couple of exceptions but they don't stray far from the path. 

So I partly agree and partly disagree!
        That's fair.
    It's unfair to compare two character archetypes that go for two different things entirely. Lily is meant to be a cutesy character and the clumsy daughter of T. Hawk. Lily's weapons are also part of her culture and help her fly like a hawk, and her "fruity" beanie is only an alt costume.


You'd do better comparing characters like Akuma, who is a literally raging demon fueled by anger and one of the more powerful characters in FGs. You get that by just looking at him. His hair is fucked and his eyes are void of humanity.


Compare to AKI, a snake woman with a poison addiction and creepy Ring girl aura. You get that from looking at her eery smile and weird hair, as well as her Freddy Krueger claws.


Rashid, a fun streamer who moves with the wind. You get that by looking at his baggy clothes flapping in the wind, meant to put emphasis on his wild nature. Compare Rashid to Shaheen and...yeah, that's a more fair comparison but shows who's really on top.


Abigail is great for a casual player. The biggest character in SF history doesn't need good looks. His size speaks for itself and makes him a more intimidating prescence than any normal Tekken character like Jak or King.


Hakan is badass when you don't got a bitch in your ear telling you he's not. Same with Abel. Mf does judo throws with extra strength. It's not exactly "looney tunes", it's just not realism, which is far better than regular armbars or kneebars. I much prefer a character that is so powerful he can send you 50 feet into the air in a man-made tornado and slam you down to throw your ass into the wall.


This is scratching the surface though. Your outdated take doesn't really apply here. SF characters are more bursting with personality while Tekken requires existing knowledge to understand what characters stand for and what they're capable of.
        fr, what is this hakan slander. That dude was cold
If you see an article and it’s from polygon you can ignore it, they’ve got no integrity.
Do yourself a favor and avoid Polygon completely.
Lol people still struggling with Tekken crazy
It’s crazy how polygon has now became the new IGN. Meanwhile IGN’s review isn’t half bad for once.
    I agree = good review  
I disagree = bad review

Some of y'all need to learn to accept other people's opinions, especially when it comes to highly subjective things.
        An opinion is only valid if it’s backed up with valid facts. 

When they make shit up and then use that as their own opinion, that’s no different from spewing bullshit. 

Readers like you is what’s wrong with gaming reviews today.
Manon is the most boring design in sf6 lol. This guy just has shit taste in characters
I usually like reading different perspectives but Polygon... yeah, they get ignored everytime. 
Garbage review
Screw all that I’m disappointed T8 will have no single player content
    What do you mean?
TEKKEN 8 TRASHHHH
I don’t think so, I have been a die hard tekken fan, and the main reason I like Tekken over any other fighting game is because of how unique it is(was) when it came to its mechanics. It had a competitive feeling to it, a certain learning curve. Not to say t8 doesnt have one but it’s not as steep as other tekkens, in fact they lowered the skill ceiling but raised the skill floor.

Why is that? Well from what I could experience playing the beta was:

- Heavily nerfed mobility, side stepping is almost pointless because a lot of moves have tracking now. 

- The heat bar makes the game too arcadey, can’t wait till a certain characters just needs heat to win the round 

- Their poor business strategy, I’m not saying it won’t be profitable but the way they are going about adding characters into the game makes it repulsive personally, I mean come on, you’re selling previous base characters as DLC, adding a handful new characters to the base roaster, just no thanks, I am not buying tekken 8 unless my friends force me to 

P.S no Eliza, automatically worst tekken series /s
    You like Eliza?
The complaint about “lack of diversity in body types” just reeks of wokeism. Can’t they just put a fat black gay paraplegic in their power fantasy muscle fighting game?
    It's not even about representation, you terminally online midwit, but about the devs getting lazy and unimaginative. Go in Tekken 7 customization, throw on a generic t-shirt and pants on the characters and cut their head off: You can't tell half the cast apart from each other. Contrast to Street Fighter for example where you're hard pressed to find two characters with the same base body shape.
    Sounds like you're projecting bud. Variety is the spice of life and it's characters like Dhalsim, Zangief, Blanka and Honda that made games like Street Fighter so memorable. If every character in 2 had a Ryu body type and all hailed from Japan then that shit would not be anywhere near as interesting or iconic
        Jak 
Panda
Kuma
Leroy
King 
Yshimitsu
Yeh they all look Japanese and hailed from Japan 
Gameplay made street fighter what it is not dhalsim or blanka.
That article is stupid.
            Jak is fair


Panda and Kuma are the same body type so it should count as one copy and pasted


Leroy has the same body type as everyone else, he's just an old dude. Not like Dhaslsim who's an old dude AND can stretch his limbs mad far.


King isnt the imposing figure physique wise. He's 6'3, not the 7'0 beats Zangief is where his forearm is the size of a character's head.


Yoshismitsu? I don't think it's the article that's stupid, bud. Yoshismitsu has the same body type as every other character. No, the armor doesn't count since it's just that: armor, not body type.


Compare that to SF6, which has Marisa, Zangief, Lily, Blanka, Chun-Li, etc. Everyone is much more diverse than Tekken body wise and design wise. Their designs ooze with personality, which Tekken struggles with, especially here.


(Also, you're VERY wrong about the gameplay making SF. Mad casuals to this day quote "yoga flame!" And "Hadoken!" As well as pick a wild animal character like Blanka.)
    Anyone using "wokeism" unironically has a SERIOUS amount of brain rot. You do realize that Steve (who's a middleweight) having the same body type as Feng, or Raven being just as jacked as Jin, is an example of a lack of diversity in body types? It's not about disability, race and weight, it's that all the men and women have the same body models with very VERY slight differences. The moment you see the word diversity, please try your hardest not to abandon all critical thinking like a Facebook boomer.
    Nah, they've ruined characters like Law and Feng who are supposed to be more slender  muscular appropriate for their fight style but now they're body builder yolked.

The article is pretty on the money.
I’ve said it before these articles don’t get fighters and specifically Tekken. The fanbase is feeling it and that’s the most important voice in all this as if you keep them happy then the game lasts even longer. I’m glad Harada isn’t concerned about this crap tbh. It’s Tekken 8 those who know just know what’s it about and as for the story. It’s not meant to be an oscar worthy story we all know that lol C’mon now the bread and butter is the fighting engine. If the story was top tier but the gameplay was below average and catered more to these articles. Tekken would had died a long time ago just saying. These game journalists always be saying dumb things tbh. 😆
    Its really not a bad article. Op makes it sound worse than it is. Tekken can always improve thats all the author is trying to say.
        I read it more and yeah I see what he means. Still the story at least in T8 has come a long way. It’s pretty awesome seeing it be cinematic they could had just as easily never done it. It’s great for what it is I get some want improvements and well in due time. I’m just happy we got Tekken Ball back can’t wait to play it 🏐
        The article overall isn't bad but the author's character taste is questionable at best. He labels Victor as being Colonel Sanders. IMO Victor's design is completely badass. Meanwhile he is in love with the anorexic flamingo known as Manon.
        writer brought up some good points its not a hit piece the guy does know tekken. but there's so many non issues he decided to include i cant understand his point that streey fighter 6 roster is beaming with personality & looks amazing while tekkens is getting too "swole and shredded" or "faces are "indistinct" 😐 tekken 8's graphics for maps and characters are leagues better then tekken 8 i just dont see where he's coming from there. as far as gameplay and online there are issues i can see that
    > The fanbase is feeling it and that’s the most important voice in all this as if you keep them happy then the game lasts even longer. -- It’s Tekken 8 those who know just know what’s it about and as for the story.

It's this kind of mentality that kills long running series: Obsessively catering to an existing audience at the cost of attracting new people. A community that only feeds on existing fans, not bringing in any new ones can only ever shrink in size. Tekken's barrier of entry as a technical fighter with huge roster and move lists is already a daunting prospect for newcomers, there's no point deliberately making it even worse.
        I think it's crazy to suggest T8 isn't bringing in new players. The marketing alone will do that, but the game's wider breadth of content and features, as well as the highly improved training tools and Special Style controls, will go further in getting more people into Tekken than probably even T7 did. 

Their budget and scope for T8 is way higher, and it shows.
        The thing is Tekken 8 has 30 years of existence. What can they do to bring in more new players? They are doing that by the way. Just that anyone who is into Tekken has been a longtime fan and that’s honestly a huge support and why the series has made it this far. Eventually even new fans become old fans can’t keep trying to recreate the wheel as they say. T8 is still fresh and new plus new faces too that older fans may not exactly like them but newer fans do. So everyone is being catered to and might I add there is a full blown tutorial with helpful tips. Then there is special style that is directed at new players. I think my comment wasn’t exactly clear on this my bad.
    exactly what happened with MK1, good story, interesting characters, but poor gameplay, modes and features (this is koming from the MK fans)
        Yeah I initially liked MK1 a good amount, but over time it really lost me. The seasonal mode is hot garbage. I couldn't even finish the first one because it was so repetitive and easy it was. I wasn't improving anything about my play by going through it, so I didn't care. 

Also, the gameplay... Can't explain it, but there is just something really frustrating about MK1 in comparison to the ones before it. Which is too bad because the roster is really great.
        I played the new one and man it’s sad that’s actually true. MK1 definitely feels rushed for sure.
        Woahhh huh? I thought the general consensus was that mk 1 gameplay was good
            I can’t speak on MK1 that much but lately been seeing a bunch say it’s dying. Even Max brought it on his YT so something is off with MK1 at least by those who play it competitive.
            it is indeed better than 11, but not better than MKX or any others. ironically, the concurrent players of 11 and X are even higher than MK1
A Street Fighter fanboy writing a Tekken review. Not much else you can expect from it, really.
No journalist has ever known anything about Tekken in the history of Tekken.
Tekken 8 is subjectively a bad game.

It is arguably a bad fighting game.

It is objectively a bad Tekken game.
    People really should stop using words they don't understand one bit.
        I agree.

Keep Tekken out of your mouth.
            Makes no sense whatsoever, but ok. It's just cringy when people use phrases such as "objectively bad" based on their opinions.
                Nah.

What’s cringy is failing to see objective truth for the failings of your own blatant bias.

But you do you.

I’m sure you will.
                    Lol okay. Entertain me then, what's the argument that it's an objectively bad game?
    Elaborate or kick rocks.
        It is up to you to defeat your own bad habits.

Kick your own rocks.

You can do it, man.

Smoke ‘em.

Get crackin’.

Or rather don’t, in the contextual vernacular.

But do, if they help you cope with Tekken 8.

I guess?

Up to you.

*shrug*
There are a lot of people that can’t infer a characters design unless it literally is a cartoon character who’s entire personality is conveyed through strict emojis.
I am a bit sad that they took the ground game away.
Nah, I see exactly where he is coming from. 


It's nice to have a review with some nuance. 
Ive only played Tekken 2 and Tekken on PSP casually without knowledge about Frame Data and Stuff and only rediscovered T7 via Evo (but didn't play). I would say the simple poly Designs were more appealing to me, because most newer designs try too hard to be too much/fancy and are thus difficult to read; or basic designs are too basic without any memorable characteristics. SF and MK designs are basic in general, but they all have few characteristics, which stand out in the right way. Designs like Yoshimitsu and King are still perfect in this regard. Nevertheless I think I'll take the nostalgia train and play Tekken this time.
The guy who wrote it also did a video about how to get into fighting games and it's the reason I picked up and fell in love with Tekken 7, he deff knows what he's talking about. I wasn't sure I agreed with his "mushy" take at first but honestly Lee's new robo design is kinda meh and does take away from his personality imo.

Besides that, he goes on to compare the varied body types in SF6 and ya know what, I actually agree with this. I just saw a post today on this sub of a picture of all the dudes side by side with their shirts off.... it's like copy and pasted lol.

So while I think the game looks great and personally love the character designs and such, I do kind of understand some of the points in the article.
this guy actually has a pretty good video on how to get into fighting games as well
This is written pretty well actually and I agree with everything he says except SF6 story (I’m assuming he’s referring to WT mode) being deep and interesting. Well at a glance it’s really fun but I just wasn’t too invested when I finally got the chance to try. My favorite discussion he brings up is about the character designs feeling less iconic. They’re cool in this game sure but in many ways, not what we love them for
All polygon does is age poorly
anyone else crashing alot?

maybe the article was right being great isnt enough cause crashes to muchh lol

im on xbox and crashed like 5 times on pc its mostly about crashing and not working correctly

i thought 70 bucks was suppose to make the game work more gooder
The game has zero personality. I get it we all like the game mechanically, but stylistically there’s nothing going on. the theme is “tough guys punch each other in a stadium”
No,

I mean the roster is heavily incomplete and yes "mushy" (although I would use a different term. ) in my eyes. 
Just got it today, have been having a blast with it, wish customization was better but on a more serious note what is an extra thomas and tropical herman hotdog?
Tekken is making the exact same character design mistakes that Street Fighter did with the over the top muscular characters. King got roid rage veins now too lol.
I agree on the characters designs not standing out as defined archetypes to newcomers (a problem MK1 would have if not for brand saturation). That being said, I prefer this roster over SF6/MK1. 
I can **absolutely** agree with the "characters aren't really distinct" portion of the review. Quite frankly he hit the nail on the head. When you look at lili, reina, jun, xiaoyu. If you're new like me..what do you pick ? You would have no clue..you just....pick and try their move set. There's nothing about them that differentiates them with their style. There's nothing obvious. The guys are a bit different but he does make some absolutely valid points that their style doesn't always shine through their look and feel. Unless you've played previous tekkens, for new players, its a bit of a mess to figure out who you should pick. There's very little game play from each cast to show off who they are and what they are truly all about. So it's kind of dissappointing in a way. 

&#x200B;

However, the game is awesome once you commit to it. It's just not as polished in SOME areas and I think thats a pretty fair statement. The character uniqueness being one of them
I don't understand how this game won't be "the best" for newcomers when it has the most indepth training tools of like any fighting game I've ever seen.
    I am worried about T8’s gameplay, as it seems mashy and that the heat stysyem and moves make things very rock paper scissors, but I think they achieved their goal because….

A nine year old nephew tried the demo and was on the verge of karate kicking the house furniture apart and running away to enter the tournament.

All the flashy moves, big hits, rush effects and etc had him wanting to play it pretty hard. I think i am the one confused by all the new stuff instead.
        I think it's going to be a struggle for returning players more than new players. Returning players are going to have to learn to stop playing as Defensive as they have since pretty much forever, while new players won't have that issue.
            Exactly. TMM at first was very annoyed about Kazuya changes, saying how bad he is, but recently came around realising that Kaz is no longer just a turtle and a punish bot. He can actually pressure with some of his tools.
                I feel like every character is going to be like that once people start learning them. Jin actually looks fun in this game to me and I haven't touched a Mishima at all in Tekken 7.
                    I will smash you with Jin and allow you a rematch and let my 10 year old fight the first round in a bamboozling fashion. It's actually a handicap cos he always loses at my level 🧐

*Crackles with lightning*
                >TMM

Im new to Tekken. Whats TMM?
                    TheMainManSwe. The Tekken dad. Kazuya main, one of the bigger Tekken streamers and youtubers.
                        gotchu thank you
            It is never going to be a struggle for old players compared to new in Tekken. It still has the bloated move list and you still have years of frame memory and match up knowledge.
                been punishing fools 25 years brother
            Nobody likes to watch defensive play style even sf6 is more aggressive work the drive system. Granblue versus rising gives you a strong way to break a defense. Defensive is boring to play against and watch.
                I think a good, solid defense can be a lot of fun to watch when the offensive tools are just as good as the defensive ones. 

but yeah, in fighting games especially a good defense can be a bit boring to watch.
                Nobody likes to watch mashing play style too.

Tekken so popular exactly because it have working defensive play style.
                    I have yet to see this "mashing play style" in any of the competitive matches I've seen of Tekken 8, the game isn't even out yet and top level players haven't even gotten to play that much. Give it a bit for the actual play style to develop. 

it's so weird seeing this game get praised review wise but suddenly shit on right before release.
                        I want to notice that "mashing play style" is exaggeration when people compare T7 and T8. It's THAT bad, but something many don't like.

If you want to see difference, watch T8 Knee Feng vs T7 Knee Feng  matches.

Like this:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUMmMiE8B3k

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86aeTl2xCQQ

Just compare amount of time characters stay in neutral/bkdish around.
                I like how you say NOBODY likes it just to make it seem like you have a stronger argument.
                    Can't argue with fighting games becoming more aggressive. Even a card game like Magic The Gathering has taken away slow play styles like draw go control. Overwatch 2 took away the second tank. It's not just fighting games
                SF6 is a bad game. It is a horrible FG. It is a shite SF game.
                the only reason i got into tekken 7 and watched it was because of the movement system. i love watching very defensive games, i think thats where the system shines
            Tekken 8 is designed for casuals and people who don't like fighting games. They've ruined the gameplay which explains why its getting high reviews pandering to the noobs who previously were getting destroyed due to the high skill ceiling 
            A very polite way of saying harada fucked it lmao 
                the game isn't even out yet and you're saying he fucked it? how, elaborate? 

People have been complaining about Tekkens turtle always defend style of gameplay for a while, and Harada listened and tried to make the game more aggressive, and it seems he's succeeded, so how did he fuck up?
                    His ruined it by casualising the game. So many franchises have been ruined for pandering to casuals 
                    > the game isn't even out yet and you're saying he fucked it? how, elaborate?

It's for sure not complete over, but you don't need to be Professor to see how each character got pressure tools. Like more mixups, pluses with heats, and so on.

And you don't need to be a professor to watch matches awaiwable for month, for all ranges of skills, to compare to current tekken. Watch for example Knee Feng in T8, then T7, and tell me pace of the game didn't changed to be much more aggressive.
                        At the end of the day it’s 60 bucks for a game that has mid netcode and none of the stuff that myself or other legacy players like about tekken, we already have tekken 3 rollback that runs perfectly and will hopefully soon see fightcade integration, ppsspp is getting rollback soon so we will have DR, the question is do I want to pay full price for a game I know I won’t like and that isn’t what legacy players want in a tekken game 
                            The question aren't about you (not trying to be rude, just explaining). It's about game alternative.

Mate, look, Tekken 3 can not compete with anything modern. You have to joke to call it playable compared to T7.

T7 might be 'alternative'. In theory. But in practice, it won't have enough players. T7 already was unplayable for solid part of players outside of prime-time, and it will become dead after T8 for sure.

So, there is basically two outcomes. You either doesn't play fighting games at all, or you play T8.
                                that's not even remotely true. every other franchise has lively legacy scenes. i can get games on SF2X much faster than i could in the last year of tekken, GGAC+R has has a very active player base since it got rollback in 2020. this idea that no one is playing the old game just isn't true. in saying that tekken never had the support street fighter, kof, guilty gear ever had. while capcom, snk and arcsys have been updating legacy games with modern netcode for modern audiences (capcom is barely on this list in fairness) namco have done... nothing. there is no means to play old tekken games until very recently. and still no means for matchmaking outside of discords. this is due to change with fightcade integration but it's a slow process.   


outside of that tekken 3 not being playable ? really ? the game is great. and tag 1 fixed alot of the issues t3 had (at the cost of the balance admittingly.) but it's still really fun with alot of viable characters.. and as already mentioned has better netcode than tekken 8 which is full price. that's the main point. how can namco ask for full price when they haven't even added decent netcode.
                    Because it sucks lmao, drive rush in tekken, backdashing is EVEN WORSE than it is in T7, the balance changes force the game to be much more unga bunga while still not building the game to be actually fun on offense

And even outside of the netcode is confirmed by people with review copies to be bad. Tekken 3 has fluid rollback and there is updates on ppsspp rollback for DR every day. I’m not spending full price for a bad tekken game with bad online when I can play the better ones for free with better netplay 
        Absolutely it worked. Never touched tekken a day in my life, have maybe 100 hours total in 2D fighters. Just hopping on and mashing a bunch of buttons in random order is hella fun. And no I’m not 9 years old
            Do you mash buttons for all fighters?
                No. I take a couple 2D fighters seriously enough to truly learn and get decent. 3d fighters are not my thing typically but I’ve still had fun with t8 just fucking around with friends without really trying too much. Basically I’m the target audience of their changes I guess was the point
            This game is designed for Fortnite braindead kiddies rather than Tekken fans. If you just wanna bash buttons then go ahead and enjoy. I'm sticking with Tekken 7 which actually requires skill
                Tekken 8 has a lot of depth, just like Tekken 7. You are allowed to dont like the changes. But to say that it requires no skill... is just wrong and stupid. Doesnt make any sense at all.
        It seems to offer a lot more accessibilities to new player for sure. However, apart from pulling off cool looking moves from a fluke here and there, I say that's as good as any new comers will ever be.

Saying this as someone who hasn't played since TTT. Almost 20 years lol. I CAN mash buttons and pull off some nice moves but on my first day on demo I can't even beat the arcade mode lol. I had to look up poking games and relearn some combos to make progression.
            Most new comers won't stay that's true, it's going to be the same thing it always is, dedicated new players who decided to try and learn the game. That won't change, they just have more tools to do so in the full game from my understanding.
        I had the same worries until I watched some PhiDX commentary on T8 matches. He’ll clearly state that a match is a good T7 match or T8 match, depending on how the competitors utilize the new mechanics. So now I have a good grasp on when to use my heat, how to retain it and use it to its full potential.
    Newcomers and casuals are typically not in it for labbing or the grind to get better.

They're usually in it for at least three other more common reasons -- flavor of the month/popularity, lore/immersion, and appreciation of aesthetics and archetypes.

Lore is too complicated and a soft reset doesnt stop people from wondering what happened to get to this point.

Character archetypes are also wildly all over the place. Jack8 doesnt even look like a military deployed musclebot, Victor is gonna confuse the fuck outta people, we have a bear wearing a headband that presumably knows karate, and no one outside of the Tekken Universe can explain why King/Armor King communicates exclusively in cat growls.

Tekken 8 is very much a refinement, but it's also in the same unapologetic personality camp as DMC5 where if you don't vibe with it, then you just won't get it or get into it.
        this is how i interpret the opinion too. you cannot change the challenge of getting people to commit to learning something which is niche.

having tools to learn more smoothly and quickly is really great, but you have to already want to use the tools for it to matter. something people who are totally new to the genre probably don't care about.

people are much too quick to dismiss opinions that find any fault.
    Theres been a really good Guilty Gear Tutorial mode, i dont remember wich one.  
I think XRD. They were arguably Top tier material too, but you probably cant compare the two based on how differently both games play.
        Strive has awesome tutorials. They could be more in-depth for certain mechanics but the fact that they have one for Kara cancels and other character specific tricks is pretty neat.
            ye i didnt mean strive, i think it was xrd
    ? Tekken 8s training tools are basic from what ive seen.

Arc sys work games have the best tutorial from at least GG: rev2
        The Training mode is really good, with the ability to reset during actions to train for specific set ups and the normal training mode things. the replay system gives you tips for how to improve mid replay and even lets you play through parts of the replay to help you learn how to handle a situation better. 

the arcade mode thing also teaches you the game as you play. I've never played Rev 2, and I don't doubt it has a really good training mode. 

But again, based on the limited fighting games i've played (SF5, SF6, MK1, MK11, Injustice 2, Soul Calibur 6, DBFZ, GGStrive, BBTag) it has the best training *tools* of any fighting game i've seen.
            Sorry, i misinterprated tools for beginners learning.

Yeah, youre right everything is there for a great system
                My bad for typing it the way I did; I think some people thought I meant the lab/training mode/combo practice when I meant everything the game throws at new players.
    if nothing else it'll be the best newcomer experience a fresh tekken player could have
    Not to mention that “special style” stuff and the fact it has way more single player content for casuals than the last two Tekken games.
    the ghost fights were all i needed baby
    This game is deffo better for newcomers. As one myself, I played the demo and both Beta’s and can say I avidly enjoyed my time, especially ranking up way higher than I did in 7. The gameplay feels much smoother and not as slowed or delayed, while keeping you thoroughly engaged. Plus the characters I did play in 7 got some changes to their inputs in 8 (Lars being a good example) so it made my experience better.
    >when it has the most indepth training tools of like any fighting game I've ever seen.

I feel like that doesn't attract or retain as many players as FGC would like to believe.

It mostly comes down to whether or not a player can attach themselves to the game in some way and be okay with losing.

Problem with Tekken is that the formula largely remained the same over the years so the catch up game is a lot harder + a lot of the characters end up playing fairly similarly until you need to get to pinnacle levels with them, so new players end up getting bopped all day long.

Tekken is oddly way more fun than most other games when played casually and locally for new comers I feel like. It's the only game I've seen bunch of kids play at a house party with girls, it's the only game I've seen bunch of salarymen play with yakuza looking guys in random ass arcade in Japan laughing and having fun.
The fact that he's a King player says it all.
The only issue I see so far is this broken matchmaking system. It makes zero sense because even if you choose the +/- 2 lvls which is the lowest option, you can fight the most difficult person ever, or win a match 3-0 twice no problem.
I mean Leo does convey character, just not an interesting one. And he does that well.

It's your classic, naive and simple minded shonen protagonist that can do anything if he believes in it. I find that uninteresting aswell, but you cant say he doesnt convey this character pretty well. Like Gon from HxH or something.

Shaheen i find harder to describe too though, especially since he started surfin on people. 

(And now we have a character whose whole personality is Coffee.. xD)
Absolutely agree. Over the years, I came to appreciate Tekken's overall more grounded character design. Apart from the obvious Yoshimitsu, bears, kangaroos and whatnot, I'd say that a newcomer seeing the cast for the first time would have a harder time remembering who is who compared to say MK, Street Fighter and Guilty Gear.
Brave of you to voice this opinion. I agree with you. +1
Yup, completely agree. It’s not even that the characters are bad exactly, just that a lot of them are uninspiring and that’s one of the flaws of having a lot of characters and having an overall more realistic theme when it comes to designs and play styles. It worked out well in the early games because of the lack of characters, but not so much when the roster grows. 

Fighting games are the main games I play, and I play mostly all of them. I’m that one guy that always invites friends or coworkers over and make them play with me, and the only people that want to play Tekken are the people who already like it or grew up with it because they see the cast and only a few of them stand out in their eyes. Street Fighter nails it since their whole thing is playing off of stereotypes and having exaggerated features, Mortal Kombat always had color coding, elements, and throwing on identifiable features for the characters that can’t fit that, like Kotal being green and obviously Aztec, Baraka having spikes, Kenshi with the blindfold, Raiden with the straw hat and glowing eyes, and so on. Dead or Alive is just pick the one that’s most attractive to you. Guilty Gear has all the characters looking unique. Killer Instinct and Darkstalkers tells you exactly what a character is like because they’re horror and fantasy themed. Bloody Roar has the animals. Soul Calibur has the weapons. Samurai Shodown has the weapons and outfits. Marvel’s got the name recognition. 

All these games have things that make their characters stand out from one another and makes many of them recognizable to people who aren’t fully into them, but then there’s Tekken with only a handful of characters where you could just give a short description of the character for others to know, like the samurai, the leopard guy, the robot, old guy with the eagle hair, guy with the wings, little Chinese girl, bear, while a lot of them require you to say more. 

I love Tekken, it’s my second favorite fighting game right behind Bloody Roar, but it’s tough trying to get people into it since the cast isn’t full of “fun” or “cool” looking characters unless you actually watch how they all play where most people also aren’t going to be able to differentiate a lot of them
    I said this to the initial comment, but this is why guest characters matter. Nobody outside of tekken is ever going to pick up T8 because of idk Jins new design. You cant sell characters like that to players that arent already fans, they dont know jin so they wont care how he looks or how awesome he now plays. But you show them a character from a franchise they know like noctis and negan and all of a sudden their ears perch up.

I am just saying if tekken 8 becomes "the cool fighting game that has Tifa in it" (for example) for people outside of the community that's when it will become huge.
    Its gonna be interesting how Tekken 8 sells. It panders to casuals that don't like the game 
Also is it me or is tekken a giant sausage fest
    That and the women that exist tend to (with some notable exceptions) be far more homogeneous than the men.
    *You got a bunch of men locked up,*

*in a warm place...*

  * All of em' get hard;
  * All of em' horny;
  * All of em' gots sexual desires.

*So what are you gonna do?*

***You won't let em' have a woman;***

*they gonna have each-*

***Listen, man;***

*somebodies gonna have to give up some booty,*

*and its just that simple.*
definitely agree.
This is a fantastic way to look at it. I think op is lookin at this as a sort of black and white or you're with us or against us sort of mentality. It doesn't have to only be perfect or only be terrible
I agree.  Outside of the core characters a lot of the rest are just there, and even with the core cast sometimes it struggles.
I am a newcommer to the game, and i can see your point as to struggling to convey characters personalities.Half the fighters in the game practice "Karate A, Karate B, Karate C" and that can sometimes feel a little bland, but then you suddenly see "Wrestling, Capoeira, Kempo\*1, Taekwondo".However King and Armor King who are supposed to be very Flamboyant dont have any facial expressions due to their big masks, their Capoeira fighter is a DLC character, their Kempo fighter is ->in my opinion<- the most vanilla looking fighter in the game\*2.

I get your point, but they add so much spice through exceptional movement tech, deep movelists and INSANE graphic design that i simply dont see how something like street fighter and guilty gear can compete in their current state.My main concern is casuals playing through campaign and jumping online to be absolutely smashed by Tekken Gods playing mishimas. Imaine going online to play for fun and being absolutely wrecked by wavedashing and animation canceling.

\*1 i know Kempo is technically Karate\*2 Fengs costume seleciton are in my opinion 4 recolors of the same outfit, and a suit. Why dont they do like they did with Reina and give him a Samurai outfit? He practices THE samurai fighting style. Imagine feng in full edo period armor.
as a character design enthusiast I completely agree. but as an overall game, I think Tekken 8 far more superior than SF6 and MK1 when it comes to mechanic, modes, features, roster variety options and gameplay
    In terms of mechanics I’d probably give it to SF6 as of right now. The interaction of all the systems of SF6 work very well with each other and lead to a lot different scenarios.There are so many offensive mechanics, but balanced out by defensive mechanics like the parry, classic FG strategies like throwing fast pokes to interrupt, throws and the classic wake up super. 

For T8 it’s going to take a while to see how the new mechanics mix with each other like chip damage, the rally mechanics, and heat mode. We’ve already seen a lot of vitriol opinions on the changes and honestly it might even get more hard to tell because most people posting on the sub Reddit are online warriors. And with online we have issues like the rollback not actually being rollback, and cross play with PC with a super demanding game when we know not everyone has a beefy PC. Even games like Strive and SF6 which work on potatoes have people going in without an optimized PC and making online a nightmare to play sometimes.
    Really? Im looking forward to t8 but I have yet to see more/better modes and features than sf6. At best its paralel at worse just a bit behind.
        There are more game modes I think
            SF6 has 35 combinations of match types from extreme battle alone. Add that to different variations of team battle, regular battle, avatar battles and the retro game cabinets.
You have an upvote.  Has been a tekken fan since Tekken 1 release.
I can see Tekken's character designs being reserved compared to SF, though that's not necessary a detriment. It's just like how SF would possibly be reserved compared to...skullgirls
I wonder how they'd respond to the earlier games like 1-4 where the presentation of these games was more accessible to regular people who may or may not play games.
To be honest with you, I'd rather have more grounded characters like Asuka and Leo (they have a personality but not flamboyant) instead of caricatures like Ken, Ryu, Juri, Dee Jay etc.
    Yeah this mostly comes down to preference. If we assume however, that most if not all fighting games are trying to create instantly appealing, iconic designs. Then that approach just won’t deliver on that goal, plus I never felt like they fleshed out the more naturalistic characters enough to justify that trade off (though I know that’s very subjective).
While I do agree with your take your examples are a bit weird. T8 asuka is a huge improvement in terms of character and expression compared to T7 where she was already one of the more popular characters. But yeah, with some characters they did a really great job both visually and in terms of pushing their personality within their gameplay (the mishimas, jun lars, zafine and more), for others they did a really basic job (lee, shaheen, leo, steve etc).

However the article mentions this in context with getting outsiders into the franchise. Which has never been done with the "regulars" but always with a mixture of the overall visuals and feel of the game - tekken just looks incredible - and guest characters.

A lot of tekken 8s success will hinge on whether or not we get good guest characters. The stuff that casual video game magazines write articles about to land tekken in their periphery. Leo and shaheen were never going to grab the attention from anyone outside of tekken. T7 did a pretty good job with guest characters, if we stay on that level or even surpass it that's going to determine the influx of new players.
Yeah, 7 at least had Fahkumran and Bob which had quite a different visual appeal. 

In 8 everyone is overly buff and every female is identical body wise(and what's up with faces being so unexpressive and doll like ugh), which is kinda sad. 

Im most disappointed in art direction of hwoarang tho, like why is he so wide and why did he suddenly got his shoulders and hands so big, he's a taekwondo fighter ffs.
If Victor didn’t have that sword he’d be near perfect for me aesthetically
i think a way to visualize it for folks is to look at SF 6 and the avatar system. lets say you make the generic jumpsuit guy and give him all of Cammy's moves. without question, you'll know its cammy. same goes for loading a Blanka Moveset, Gief move set etc.

now imagine tekken with a similar avatar system. you have generic man in jumpsuit with Kazuyas move set. then Jin's, then asukas, then lars. i'd wager most people who aren't already fans will struggle to identify whos who.
    That was always the fun of mokujin vs mokujin battles back in the day. Whoever could figure out their opponent's character (as well as their own) first had the huge advantage. Of course some tekken characters have really unique neutral stances (i.e. Eddy, Law) so sometimes it was a dead give away
For sure!
No GOAT (Marduk) or Lei is crazy 


And putting Fahk at DLC AGAIN is even crazier. 


He has to be in the game given his popularity..
Feng Wei Slowly Getting worse and worse default designs actually pisses me off
>Also anyone saying "well you can just customize them to whatever you want", that's a cop out and you know it. It's no replacement for good character design that reflects and reinforces the characters personality and gameplay.


Big agree there.  Personally I massively prefer to use sick looking default/presets over customizations.  Super customized characters feel like they lose a ton of personality to me.
I think this isn't just neccessarily the designs but also simply the amount of characters. It's just way harder to have 32 characters be unique especially if you are forced to include the entire mishima bloodline due to story reasons vs SF6s 18 character roster.

I could easily make tekken 8s roster look as unique as the one from SF6 if I could chose 18 particular characters.

I will say though SF in general does a good job at having their characters double as marketing tools by having their bodies look like they do. They are fairly unapologetic when it comes to using the female characters to draw in an audience while T8 on that front is fairly homogenous. If you were to turn off the natural fighting stance and just show me the silhouette of the female fighters I would have a hard time telling who is who. I dont even play SF6 and I could easily tell with that game. Normally I would say it makes sense since T8 has a more grounded artstyle however in T8 all of the male characters having humanly impossible muscles so I feel like they missed an opportunity here. The thin/fat and in case of girls muscular/sexy body type is completely missing.
    The problem is every single female characters have the same body. Like someone else said in the thread as. 3 female characters from sf6 have more diversity in their designs than all of tekken 8 female characters and I love the game .

Someone made a video with the bodies of women from different sport files at an Olympic level and they all look different and easy to distinguish. They just wanted to make attractive characters
        Yepp this is true. Someone else mentioned that this is for customization purposes which makes sense but begs the question if we should sacrifice that sort of body diversity for the sake of having our bread costume not clip through our character :/
            Especially when we can’t even have t6 costumes. I was so excited damn
    idk why the launch roster of SF6 got a pass while missing chunks of the og roster. i know its explained by lore but regardless every single character from SF2 should have be present
        I don't think SF fans care about legacy characters as much. You can point out how small the SF6 roster is, meanwhile they will point out how little of T8 is new characters.
Just being pedantic, but, while Lili does speak french, Lili is actually from Monaco. She is also canon to the Digimon franchise for some reason.
    All rivers return to the sea and all cultures love AGUMON
>most of the male cast just give off that generic early 2000s edge vibe. If it wasn't for Lili's distinctly cute aesthetic I was most likely gonna skip this game.

I would've agreed with you if you hadn't said this.
    Thats actually his strongest point lol. Tekken has always had the outdated early 2000s vibe
        That's when TK was at its best. When the character designs were based on certain properties from the 80s, 90s, and early 2000s. But since T6, they've just been putting anything and everything in a blender like it's generic modern anime.
            Honestly Tekken has barely evolved from Tekken 1. Its literally the same game with better graphics. The problem is they have barely chabfed it enough not that they are trying everything 
Azucena doesnt interest you at all? ive never mained a female character in a fighting game before but she'll be my first for sure; such an enjoyable personality to contrast Kazuya,Jin,Bryan etc being dead serious during fights
    Azucena interests me for sure, but that's more based on the promotional videos on her rather than just purely her design. While she does have personality, none of that really shows through in her visual design. She's just wearing a generic gym outfit with a jacket with minor South American vibes.

The problem with Tekken cast is that while they have a lot of backstory, only people who have played the games for a decade are going to be familiar with that. All the newcomers are going to see are images of the fighters and I don't really know how you could make more bland characters than a lot of the Tekken cast. You'd be hard pressed to make any correct assumptions on the personality or fighting style of "buff dude #5 in a leather trenchcoat". 

Now contrast with something like Street Fighter 6, where almost every character design is bursting with personality to the point of being caricature-like: You can take a good guess about their personality and fighting style based on a single promotional image alone. There are some standouts in Tekken too, like King obviously, but they're definitely in the minority.

And this is coming from a place of very, very deep love for Tekken. It's a flawed gem of a series that sometimes tends to ride a bit too hard on brand name recognition alone and not enough innovation or effort trying to bring in new people. Tekken's barrier of entry with the huge roster and gigantic move lists is already high, boring the bejesus out of newcomers is the last thing they should do.
        Ryu,Ken and Luke burst with personality? major reason i skipped SF6 was all the og characters just look aged and not much else. all the new characters however are totally unique and interesting imo
    >Azucena doesnt interest you at all? 

Are we not in agreement that she is a poorly designed? Visually her main outfit is extremely boring and her personality is essentially a meme. I dont mind her existence but there is no way she is grabbing the attention from outsiders. Well I guess none of the 3 new characters do.
        yeah noticing a divide here i wasnt aware of all the new characters from Vincent to Azucena look really good to me didnt know people thought they were boring
            They are not boring to me, but if I was a tekken outsider none of them would catch my eyes at all. They are unknown characters that dont seem very exciting.
    Man, I despise Azucena. Maybe I'm old, but she's kinda a cringe, cheap gen z Fortnite dance single note meme character. To each their own, though, obviously
    Azucena mixup machine with very annoying sounds probably a reason to drop game, not play it.
    Oh yeah Azucena does interest me too and her inclusion does show that the team are on the right track of making more distinct characters. But then you also have Victor who encapsulates all the problems I have with Tekken designs too so it's a step forward and a step back.
some good takes, some awful ones.
For newcomers Tekken is fun when they play locally with friends of equal noobness. 

Otherwise this game is kinda hard to grasp. Among my group of friends, the only ones enjoying Tekken are the ones who played since Tekken 3 and one guy who is ultra competitive. 

They do enjoy ufc tho, which I find as boring as the game can get, while also not being an easy to pick up discipline.
Its way more casual friendly then 4 or 6..
Roster is not very good ? The fuck man enlighten me how can the roster be good 
Heihachi died except him who are we missing
    Nah I agree. The roster itself in terms of size is great, but it is missing the certain something. We have no new character that stands out for non-tekken players and the ones we have are just....too many mishimas/karate-type characters. Characters with different fighting styles and body shapes are missing, such as Bob, Lei, wang.

It's not a big problem for me because tekken is and always will be my fighting game, but the reason for that has never been the roster tbh and I feel like if we want to keep the popularity going that we started to get with T7 with need some more oomph in the roster. Hopefully the dlc characters can fix this AND - I know oldasses dont want to hear this - have those characters not be marduk, anna and AK who all have similar characters already in the game and are unmarketable to the non-tekken crowd.

Lets bring those characters in after T8 is buzzing due to having completely wild guests like T7 did.
    Iconic characters with an unique fighting style I'd say. There is too much "Karate A, Karate B".
So characters like Lei, Marduk, Eddy/Christie, and Josie/Bruce would make the base roster look more attractive.

If we had to remove characters then cramp the bears into 1 slot. Still crazy to think that they're excluding so many great fighters. Then remove devil Jin and make him unlockable or dlc. Or become devil Jin in-game when you make a special move like with Kazuya. 

And we could also get a 3rd free slot if we remove Lars. He is just a sad excuse for swedish representation. And the game really doesn't need this many Mishimas. We can't both have Lars and Jun, so pick your poison Harada.

Fit in Lei's drunken boxing, Eddy's dancing, and some Kickboxing figther and I would personally be sold on the roster alone.
    The trash ass characters like Lei, Christie, Wang. Only actual good characters missing are Marduk, Anna, and Julia.
        Since when is Lei a trash character?  Lol.
        Lei is an iconic charecter that I don't know why they always put in dlc
what would make the roster better? im blown away with how they've managed to bring nearly everyone back to Tekken 8 without factoring in the waves of dlc coming. as far as character design ok fair enough you can have that conversation as they did make some changes people arent vibing with. as far as comparing it to Street Fighter 6 roster though thats a joke. launch SF6 is missing *quite* a few characters (i only bring this up because article writer brought it up)
    Quanity doesn't make everything. SF6 has fewer characters, but provides the most depth any of those characters have ever had in the series, thus offering different methods and ways to play each one. It's a perfect balance of quantity and quality, making matchups far more easier to learn and creating one of the most balanced vanilla fighting games in history. They worked the roster from the ground up whilst Tekken's changes to their veteran characters aren't as significant in comparison, especially animation wise, though that's a nitpick, it plays a factor with reviewers like the one in the top post.
only learning this now lol, didnt know the new character designs werent recieved well🤧
not even factoring in im quite sure every character is entirely customizable; they can wear their original outfits or a custom fit (hopefully works for competitive too), so the points the article makes about how he doesnt like Pauls new hair, or Lee's new battle suit will likely be non issues for launch
jumping to conclusions like that is wild. he "reviewed" the graphics by saying SF6 looks better lmao no
    Sorry, where exactly does he say that?
        "While Street Fighter 6 seemed to take joy in rendering all kinds of exaggerated, athletic silhouettes, Tekken 8’s men all share a handful of bodies on the spectrum"

using terms like "rendering"  in the context of character graphical design is a comparison between the two graphically

substitute SF6 for MK1 in the article and it would be a low blow idk why its different here, tekken is realistic while sf6 goes for a stylized toon look shouldnt be compared at all
            He makes a very specific comparison between one element of each games character design sensibilities, youre reaching to say he was making any kind of overall statement about either games graphics. But sure tell everyone else not to jump to conclusions.
    Honest question based on your take, and I am aware many agree with you... But, I spent an hour last night switching back and forth between SF6 and Tekken 8 on PS5. To my eyes, SF6 animations appeared remarkably more fluid, and the textures more polished, crisp, less grainy, higher framerate (which I don't think is true but describes my perception). What am I missing
        street fighter 6 has way less going on then Tekken; not saying this results in a better game because SF6 offers an extremely quality experience with smooth animation like you mentioned. Tekken has to factor in destructible environments, fully interactable 3-D range, character textures change at a very detailed level throughout the battle as they take physical damage to body and clothing, the scope of the backgrounds (sf6 has a fully animated background as well but not like t8 with an entire cityscape in the background or planets moving). 

style, fluidity,smooth, these are the words that come to mind for SF6, while T8 for me is scale, detail, and realism (not saying SF6 doesnt have all these traits and again its frustrating author brought up SF6 as his example of whats "good" because they really both did an amazing job)

as far as how many people agree with me its really not the mob of blind support you'd expect with a massive launch like T8, many here expressed good opinions on why its not the perfect game id made it out to be and thought it was. id say its around a 50/50 split on positive vs negative based on the feedback. its been a while
    Oh no, you don't agree with someone else's opinion.
        all right great contribution thx 🙄
    Bro, reread your post.
        we're talking about graphics what conclusions am i jumping to lmao the game objectively has a better graphic system.
A.K.I is actually great   
she fits SF so well yet she is too different
tekken 8 is objectively the most newbie friendly title in the series; so many training mechanics to teach the basics, as far as when you'll be compeditively viable id say a year of casual play should have you ready
    Thanks for the reply. It’s good to hear that there’s a robust training mode, because I’ll certainly need it, haha. A year isn’t so bad in the grand scheme of things. I’ll just have to be patient, remember to learn from my opponents, and take it one step at a time.
Do you even know the person who wrote the article?
The dude that wrote this review is an actual Tekken player and fighting gamer. The review is solid.
I got nothing against Polygon. I know they tend to skew more towards casual games but I don't hold that against them.
because it doesnt suit his flamboyant character one bit
as far as futuristic battle suits i liked Lee's new costume 🤷‍♂️
glad i did as the article aged horribly
From what it looks like in the video link posted above, it does look like he might be a Lucky Chloe main, which is hilarious that you say this lol.
Tekken does a fantastic job with the male characters. Oodles of personality, ages, looks, just a ton of variety and something for everyone. 

I think Street Fighter probably does a better job with the female characters. The Street Fighter female characters have more varied personalities, looks, ages and sizes etc. Tekken plays it super typical Japanese with the female characters, young flawless looking characters with a peppy personality. There are a couple of exceptions but they don't stray far from the path. 

So I partly agree and partly disagree!
    That's fair.
It's unfair to compare two character archetypes that go for two different things entirely. Lily is meant to be a cutesy character and the clumsy daughter of T. Hawk. Lily's weapons are also part of her culture and help her fly like a hawk, and her "fruity" beanie is only an alt costume.


You'd do better comparing characters like Akuma, who is a literally raging demon fueled by anger and one of the more powerful characters in FGs. You get that by just looking at him. His hair is fucked and his eyes are void of humanity.


Compare to AKI, a snake woman with a poison addiction and creepy Ring girl aura. You get that from looking at her eery smile and weird hair, as well as her Freddy Krueger claws.


Rashid, a fun streamer who moves with the wind. You get that by looking at his baggy clothes flapping in the wind, meant to put emphasis on his wild nature. Compare Rashid to Shaheen and...yeah, that's a more fair comparison but shows who's really on top.


Abigail is great for a casual player. The biggest character in SF history doesn't need good looks. His size speaks for itself and makes him a more intimidating prescence than any normal Tekken character like Jak or King.


Hakan is badass when you don't got a bitch in your ear telling you he's not. Same with Abel. Mf does judo throws with extra strength. It's not exactly "looney tunes", it's just not realism, which is far better than regular armbars or kneebars. I much prefer a character that is so powerful he can send you 50 feet into the air in a man-made tornado and slam you down to throw your ass into the wall.


This is scratching the surface though. Your outdated take doesn't really apply here. SF characters are more bursting with personality while Tekken requires existing knowledge to understand what characters stand for and what they're capable of.
    fr, what is this hakan slander. That dude was cold
I agree = good review  
I disagree = bad review

Some of y'all need to learn to accept other people's opinions, especially when it comes to highly subjective things.
    An opinion is only valid if it’s backed up with valid facts. 

When they make shit up and then use that as their own opinion, that’s no different from spewing bullshit. 

Readers like you is what’s wrong with gaming reviews today.
What do you mean?
You like Eliza?
It's not even about representation, you terminally online midwit, but about the devs getting lazy and unimaginative. Go in Tekken 7 customization, throw on a generic t-shirt and pants on the characters and cut their head off: You can't tell half the cast apart from each other. Contrast to Street Fighter for example where you're hard pressed to find two characters with the same base body shape.
Sounds like you're projecting bud. Variety is the spice of life and it's characters like Dhalsim, Zangief, Blanka and Honda that made games like Street Fighter so memorable. If every character in 2 had a Ryu body type and all hailed from Japan then that shit would not be anywhere near as interesting or iconic
    Jak 
Panda
Kuma
Leroy
King 
Yshimitsu
Yeh they all look Japanese and hailed from Japan 
Gameplay made street fighter what it is not dhalsim or blanka.
That article is stupid.
        Jak is fair


Panda and Kuma are the same body type so it should count as one copy and pasted


Leroy has the same body type as everyone else, he's just an old dude. Not like Dhaslsim who's an old dude AND can stretch his limbs mad far.


King isnt the imposing figure physique wise. He's 6'3, not the 7'0 beats Zangief is where his forearm is the size of a character's head.


Yoshismitsu? I don't think it's the article that's stupid, bud. Yoshismitsu has the same body type as every other character. No, the armor doesn't count since it's just that: armor, not body type.


Compare that to SF6, which has Marisa, Zangief, Lily, Blanka, Chun-Li, etc. Everyone is much more diverse than Tekken body wise and design wise. Their designs ooze with personality, which Tekken struggles with, especially here.


(Also, you're VERY wrong about the gameplay making SF. Mad casuals to this day quote "yoga flame!" And "Hadoken!" As well as pick a wild animal character like Blanka.)
Anyone using "wokeism" unironically has a SERIOUS amount of brain rot. You do realize that Steve (who's a middleweight) having the same body type as Feng, or Raven being just as jacked as Jin, is an example of a lack of diversity in body types? It's not about disability, race and weight, it's that all the men and women have the same body models with very VERY slight differences. The moment you see the word diversity, please try your hardest not to abandon all critical thinking like a Facebook boomer.
Nah, they've ruined characters like Law and Feng who are supposed to be more slender  muscular appropriate for their fight style but now they're body builder yolked.

The article is pretty on the money.
Its really not a bad article. Op makes it sound worse than it is. Tekken can always improve thats all the author is trying to say.
    I read it more and yeah I see what he means. Still the story at least in T8 has come a long way. It’s pretty awesome seeing it be cinematic they could had just as easily never done it. It’s great for what it is I get some want improvements and well in due time. I’m just happy we got Tekken Ball back can’t wait to play it 🏐
    The article overall isn't bad but the author's character taste is questionable at best. He labels Victor as being Colonel Sanders. IMO Victor's design is completely badass. Meanwhile he is in love with the anorexic flamingo known as Manon.
    writer brought up some good points its not a hit piece the guy does know tekken. but there's so many non issues he decided to include i cant understand his point that streey fighter 6 roster is beaming with personality & looks amazing while tekkens is getting too "swole and shredded" or "faces are "indistinct" 😐 tekken 8's graphics for maps and characters are leagues better then tekken 8 i just dont see where he's coming from there. as far as gameplay and online there are issues i can see that
> The fanbase is feeling it and that’s the most important voice in all this as if you keep them happy then the game lasts even longer. -- It’s Tekken 8 those who know just know what’s it about and as for the story.

It's this kind of mentality that kills long running series: Obsessively catering to an existing audience at the cost of attracting new people. A community that only feeds on existing fans, not bringing in any new ones can only ever shrink in size. Tekken's barrier of entry as a technical fighter with huge roster and move lists is already a daunting prospect for newcomers, there's no point deliberately making it even worse.
    I think it's crazy to suggest T8 isn't bringing in new players. The marketing alone will do that, but the game's wider breadth of content and features, as well as the highly improved training tools and Special Style controls, will go further in getting more people into Tekken than probably even T7 did. 

Their budget and scope for T8 is way higher, and it shows.
    The thing is Tekken 8 has 30 years of existence. What can they do to bring in more new players? They are doing that by the way. Just that anyone who is into Tekken has been a longtime fan and that’s honestly a huge support and why the series has made it this far. Eventually even new fans become old fans can’t keep trying to recreate the wheel as they say. T8 is still fresh and new plus new faces too that older fans may not exactly like them but newer fans do. So everyone is being catered to and might I add there is a full blown tutorial with helpful tips. Then there is special style that is directed at new players. I think my comment wasn’t exactly clear on this my bad.
exactly what happened with MK1, good story, interesting characters, but poor gameplay, modes and features (this is koming from the MK fans)
    Yeah I initially liked MK1 a good amount, but over time it really lost me. The seasonal mode is hot garbage. I couldn't even finish the first one because it was so repetitive and easy it was. I wasn't improving anything about my play by going through it, so I didn't care. 

Also, the gameplay... Can't explain it, but there is just something really frustrating about MK1 in comparison to the ones before it. Which is too bad because the roster is really great.
    I played the new one and man it’s sad that’s actually true. MK1 definitely feels rushed for sure.
    Woahhh huh? I thought the general consensus was that mk 1 gameplay was good
        I can’t speak on MK1 that much but lately been seeing a bunch say it’s dying. Even Max brought it on his YT so something is off with MK1 at least by those who play it competitive.
        it is indeed better than 11, but not better than MKX or any others. ironically, the concurrent players of 11 and X are even higher than MK1
People really should stop using words they don't understand one bit.
    I agree.

Keep Tekken out of your mouth.
        Makes no sense whatsoever, but ok. It's just cringy when people use phrases such as "objectively bad" based on their opinions.
            Nah.

What’s cringy is failing to see objective truth for the failings of your own blatant bias.

But you do you.

I’m sure you will.
                Lol okay. Entertain me then, what's the argument that it's an objectively bad game?
Elaborate or kick rocks.
    It is up to you to defeat your own bad habits.

Kick your own rocks.

You can do it, man.

Smoke ‘em.

Get crackin’.

Or rather don’t, in the contextual vernacular.

But do, if they help you cope with Tekken 8.

I guess?

Up to you.

*shrug*
I am worried about T8’s gameplay, as it seems mashy and that the heat stysyem and moves make things very rock paper scissors, but I think they achieved their goal because….

A nine year old nephew tried the demo and was on the verge of karate kicking the house furniture apart and running away to enter the tournament.

All the flashy moves, big hits, rush effects and etc had him wanting to play it pretty hard. I think i am the one confused by all the new stuff instead.
    I think it's going to be a struggle for returning players more than new players. Returning players are going to have to learn to stop playing as Defensive as they have since pretty much forever, while new players won't have that issue.
        Exactly. TMM at first was very annoyed about Kazuya changes, saying how bad he is, but recently came around realising that Kaz is no longer just a turtle and a punish bot. He can actually pressure with some of his tools.
            I feel like every character is going to be like that once people start learning them. Jin actually looks fun in this game to me and I haven't touched a Mishima at all in Tekken 7.
                I will smash you with Jin and allow you a rematch and let my 10 year old fight the first round in a bamboozling fashion. It's actually a handicap cos he always loses at my level 🧐

*Crackles with lightning*
            >TMM

Im new to Tekken. Whats TMM?
                TheMainManSwe. The Tekken dad. Kazuya main, one of the bigger Tekken streamers and youtubers.
                    gotchu thank you
        It is never going to be a struggle for old players compared to new in Tekken. It still has the bloated move list and you still have years of frame memory and match up knowledge.
            been punishing fools 25 years brother
        Nobody likes to watch defensive play style even sf6 is more aggressive work the drive system. Granblue versus rising gives you a strong way to break a defense. Defensive is boring to play against and watch.
            I think a good, solid defense can be a lot of fun to watch when the offensive tools are just as good as the defensive ones. 

but yeah, in fighting games especially a good defense can be a bit boring to watch.
            Nobody likes to watch mashing play style too.

Tekken so popular exactly because it have working defensive play style.
                I have yet to see this "mashing play style" in any of the competitive matches I've seen of Tekken 8, the game isn't even out yet and top level players haven't even gotten to play that much. Give it a bit for the actual play style to develop. 

it's so weird seeing this game get praised review wise but suddenly shit on right before release.
                    I want to notice that "mashing play style" is exaggeration when people compare T7 and T8. It's THAT bad, but something many don't like.

If you want to see difference, watch T8 Knee Feng vs T7 Knee Feng  matches.

Like this:

Just compare amount of time characters stay in neutral/bkdish around.
            I like how you say NOBODY likes it just to make it seem like you have a stronger argument.
                Can't argue with fighting games becoming more aggressive. Even a card game like Magic The Gathering has taken away slow play styles like draw go control. Overwatch 2 took away the second tank. It's not just fighting games
            SF6 is a bad game. It is a horrible FG. It is a shite SF game.
            the only reason i got into tekken 7 and watched it was because of the movement system. i love watching very defensive games, i think thats where the system shines
        Tekken 8 is designed for casuals and people who don't like fighting games. They've ruined the gameplay which explains why its getting high reviews pandering to the noobs who previously were getting destroyed due to the high skill ceiling 
        A very polite way of saying harada fucked it lmao 
            the game isn't even out yet and you're saying he fucked it? how, elaborate? 

People have been complaining about Tekkens turtle always defend style of gameplay for a while, and Harada listened and tried to make the game more aggressive, and it seems he's succeeded, so how did he fuck up?
                His ruined it by casualising the game. So many franchises have been ruined for pandering to casuals 
                > the game isn't even out yet and you're saying he fucked it? how, elaborate?

It's for sure not complete over, but you don't need to be Professor to see how each character got pressure tools. Like more mixups, pluses with heats, and so on.

And you don't need to be a professor to watch matches awaiwable for month, for all ranges of skills, to compare to current tekken. Watch for example Knee Feng in T8, then T7, and tell me pace of the game didn't changed to be much more aggressive.
                    At the end of the day it’s 60 bucks for a game that has mid netcode and none of the stuff that myself or other legacy players like about tekken, we already have tekken 3 rollback that runs perfectly and will hopefully soon see fightcade integration, ppsspp is getting rollback soon so we will have DR, the question is do I want to pay full price for a game I know I won’t like and that isn’t what legacy players want in a tekken game 
                        The question aren't about you (not trying to be rude, just explaining). It's about game alternative.

Mate, look, Tekken 3 can not compete with anything modern. You have to joke to call it playable compared to T7.

T7 might be 'alternative'. In theory. But in practice, it won't have enough players. T7 already was unplayable for solid part of players outside of prime-time, and it will become dead after T8 for sure.

So, there is basically two outcomes. You either doesn't play fighting games at all, or you play T8.
                            that's not even remotely true. every other franchise has lively legacy scenes. i can get games on SF2X much faster than i could in the last year of tekken, GGAC+R has has a very active player base since it got rollback in 2020. this idea that no one is playing the old game just isn't true. in saying that tekken never had the support street fighter, kof, guilty gear ever had. while capcom, snk and arcsys have been updating legacy games with modern netcode for modern audiences (capcom is barely on this list in fairness) namco have done... nothing. there is no means to play old tekken games until very recently. and still no means for matchmaking outside of discords. this is due to change with fightcade integration but it's a slow process.   


outside of that tekken 3 not being playable ? really ? the game is great. and tag 1 fixed alot of the issues t3 had (at the cost of the balance admittingly.) but it's still really fun with alot of viable characters.. and as already mentioned has better netcode than tekken 8 which is full price. that's the main point. how can namco ask for full price when they haven't even added decent netcode.
                Because it sucks lmao, drive rush in tekken, backdashing is EVEN WORSE than it is in T7, the balance changes force the game to be much more unga bunga while still not building the game to be actually fun on offense

And even outside of the netcode is confirmed by people with review copies to be bad. Tekken 3 has fluid rollback and there is updates on ppsspp rollback for DR every day. I’m not spending full price for a bad tekken game with bad online when I can play the better ones for free with better netplay 
    Absolutely it worked. Never touched tekken a day in my life, have maybe 100 hours total in 2D fighters. Just hopping on and mashing a bunch of buttons in random order is hella fun. And no I’m not 9 years old
        Do you mash buttons for all fighters?
            No. I take a couple 2D fighters seriously enough to truly learn and get decent. 3d fighters are not my thing typically but I’ve still had fun with t8 just fucking around with friends without really trying too much. Basically I’m the target audience of their changes I guess was the point
        This game is designed for Fortnite braindead kiddies rather than Tekken fans. If you just wanna bash buttons then go ahead and enjoy. I'm sticking with Tekken 7 which actually requires skill
            Tekken 8 has a lot of depth, just like Tekken 7. You are allowed to dont like the changes. But to say that it requires no skill... is just wrong and stupid. Doesnt make any sense at all.
    It seems to offer a lot more accessibilities to new player for sure. However, apart from pulling off cool looking moves from a fluke here and there, I say that's as good as any new comers will ever be.

Saying this as someone who hasn't played since TTT. Almost 20 years lol. I CAN mash buttons and pull off some nice moves but on my first day on demo I can't even beat the arcade mode lol. I had to look up poking games and relearn some combos to make progression.
        Most new comers won't stay that's true, it's going to be the same thing it always is, dedicated new players who decided to try and learn the game. That won't change, they just have more tools to do so in the full game from my understanding.
    I had the same worries until I watched some PhiDX commentary on T8 matches. He’ll clearly state that a match is a good T7 match or T8 match, depending on how the competitors utilize the new mechanics. So now I have a good grasp on when to use my heat, how to retain it and use it to its full potential.
Newcomers and casuals are typically not in it for labbing or the grind to get better.

They're usually in it for at least three other more common reasons -- flavor of the month/popularity, lore/immersion, and appreciation of aesthetics and archetypes.

Lore is too complicated and a soft reset doesnt stop people from wondering what happened to get to this point.

Character archetypes are also wildly all over the place. Jack8 doesnt even look like a military deployed musclebot, Victor is gonna confuse the fuck outta people, we have a bear wearing a headband that presumably knows karate, and no one outside of the Tekken Universe can explain why King/Armor King communicates exclusively in cat growls.

Tekken 8 is very much a refinement, but it's also in the same unapologetic personality camp as DMC5 where if you don't vibe with it, then you just won't get it or get into it.
    this is how i interpret the opinion too. you cannot change the challenge of getting people to commit to learning something which is niche.

having tools to learn more smoothly and quickly is really great, but you have to already want to use the tools for it to matter. something people who are totally new to the genre probably don't care about.

people are much too quick to dismiss opinions that find any fault.
Theres been a really good Guilty Gear Tutorial mode, i dont remember wich one.  
I think XRD. They were arguably Top tier material too, but you probably cant compare the two based on how differently both games play.
    Strive has awesome tutorials. They could be more in-depth for certain mechanics but the fact that they have one for Kara cancels and other character specific tricks is pretty neat.
        ye i didnt mean strive, i think it was xrd
? Tekken 8s training tools are basic from what ive seen.

Arc sys work games have the best tutorial from at least GG: rev2
    The Training mode is really good, with the ability to reset during actions to train for specific set ups and the normal training mode things. the replay system gives you tips for how to improve mid replay and even lets you play through parts of the replay to help you learn how to handle a situation better. 

the arcade mode thing also teaches you the game as you play. I've never played Rev 2, and I don't doubt it has a really good training mode. 

But again, based on the limited fighting games i've played (SF5, SF6, MK1, MK11, Injustice 2, Soul Calibur 6, DBFZ, GGStrive, BBTag) it has the best training *tools* of any fighting game i've seen.
        Sorry, i misinterprated tools for beginners learning.

Yeah, youre right everything is there for a great system
            My bad for typing it the way I did; I think some people thought I meant the lab/training mode/combo practice when I meant everything the game throws at new players.
if nothing else it'll be the best newcomer experience a fresh tekken player could have
Not to mention that “special style” stuff and the fact it has way more single player content for casuals than the last two Tekken games.
the ghost fights were all i needed baby
This game is deffo better for newcomers. As one myself, I played the demo and both Beta’s and can say I avidly enjoyed my time, especially ranking up way higher than I did in 7. The gameplay feels much smoother and not as slowed or delayed, while keeping you thoroughly engaged. Plus the characters I did play in 7 got some changes to their inputs in 8 (Lars being a good example) so it made my experience better.
>when it has the most indepth training tools of like any fighting game I've ever seen.

I feel like that doesn't attract or retain as many players as FGC would like to believe.

It mostly comes down to whether or not a player can attach themselves to the game in some way and be okay with losing.

Problem with Tekken is that the formula largely remained the same over the years so the catch up game is a lot harder + a lot of the characters end up playing fairly similarly until you need to get to pinnacle levels with them, so new players end up getting bopped all day long.

Tekken is oddly way more fun than most other games when played casually and locally for new comers I feel like. It's the only game I've seen bunch of kids play at a house party with girls, it's the only game I've seen bunch of salarymen play with yakuza looking guys in random ass arcade in Japan laughing and having fun.
I said this to the initial comment, but this is why guest characters matter. Nobody outside of tekken is ever going to pick up T8 because of idk Jins new design. You cant sell characters like that to players that arent already fans, they dont know jin so they wont care how he looks or how awesome he now plays. But you show them a character from a franchise they know like noctis and negan and all of a sudden their ears perch up.

I am just saying if tekken 8 becomes "the cool fighting game that has Tifa in it" (for example) for people outside of the community that's when it will become huge.
Its gonna be interesting how Tekken 8 sells. It panders to casuals that don't like the game 
That and the women that exist tend to (with some notable exceptions) be far more homogeneous than the men.
*You got a bunch of men locked up,*

*in a warm place...*

  * All of em' get hard;
  * All of em' horny;
  * All of em' gots sexual desires.

*So what are you gonna do?*

***You won't let em' have a woman;***

*they gonna have each-*

***Listen, man;***

*somebodies gonna have to give up some booty,*

*and its just that simple.*
In terms of mechanics I’d probably give it to SF6 as of right now. The interaction of all the systems of SF6 work very well with each other and lead to a lot different scenarios.There are so many offensive mechanics, but balanced out by defensive mechanics like the parry, classic FG strategies like throwing fast pokes to interrupt, throws and the classic wake up super. 

For T8 it’s going to take a while to see how the new mechanics mix with each other like chip damage, the rally mechanics, and heat mode. We’ve already seen a lot of vitriol opinions on the changes and honestly it might even get more hard to tell because most people posting on the sub Reddit are online warriors. And with online we have issues like the rollback not actually being rollback, and cross play with PC with a super demanding game when we know not everyone has a beefy PC. Even games like Strive and SF6 which work on potatoes have people going in without an optimized PC and making online a nightmare to play sometimes.
Really? Im looking forward to t8 but I have yet to see more/better modes and features than sf6. At best its paralel at worse just a bit behind.
    There are more game modes I think
        SF6 has 35 combinations of match types from extreme battle alone. Add that to different variations of team battle, regular battle, avatar battles and the retro game cabinets.
Yeah this mostly comes down to preference. If we assume however, that most if not all fighting games are trying to create instantly appealing, iconic designs. Then that approach just won’t deliver on that goal, plus I never felt like they fleshed out the more naturalistic characters enough to justify that trade off (though I know that’s very subjective).
That was always the fun of mokujin vs mokujin battles back in the day. Whoever could figure out their opponent's character (as well as their own) first had the huge advantage. Of course some tekken characters have really unique neutral stances (i.e. Eddy, Law) so sometimes it was a dead give away
The problem is every single female characters have the same body. Like someone else said in the thread as. 3 female characters from sf6 have more diversity in their designs than all of tekken 8 female characters and I love the game .

Someone made a video with the bodies of women from different sport files at an Olympic level and they all look different and easy to distinguish. They just wanted to make attractive characters
    Yepp this is true. Someone else mentioned that this is for customization purposes which makes sense but begs the question if we should sacrifice that sort of body diversity for the sake of having our bread costume not clip through our character :/
        Especially when we can’t even have t6 costumes. I was so excited damn
idk why the launch roster of SF6 got a pass while missing chunks of the og roster. i know its explained by lore but regardless every single character from SF2 should have be present
    I don't think SF fans care about legacy characters as much. You can point out how small the SF6 roster is, meanwhile they will point out how little of T8 is new characters.
All rivers return to the sea and all cultures love AGUMON
Thats actually his strongest point lol. Tekken has always had the outdated early 2000s vibe
    That's when TK was at its best. When the character designs were based on certain properties from the 80s, 90s, and early 2000s. But since T6, they've just been putting anything and everything in a blender like it's generic modern anime.
        Honestly Tekken has barely evolved from Tekken 1. Its literally the same game with better graphics. The problem is they have barely chabfed it enough not that they are trying everything 
Azucena interests me for sure, but that's more based on the promotional videos on her rather than just purely her design. While she does have personality, none of that really shows through in her visual design. She's just wearing a generic gym outfit with a jacket with minor South American vibes.

The problem with Tekken cast is that while they have a lot of backstory, only people who have played the games for a decade are going to be familiar with that. All the newcomers are going to see are images of the fighters and I don't really know how you could make more bland characters than a lot of the Tekken cast. You'd be hard pressed to make any correct assumptions on the personality or fighting style of "buff dude #5 in a leather trenchcoat". 

Now contrast with something like Street Fighter 6, where almost every character design is bursting with personality to the point of being caricature-like: You can take a good guess about their personality and fighting style based on a single promotional image alone. There are some standouts in Tekken too, like King obviously, but they're definitely in the minority.

And this is coming from a place of very, very deep love for Tekken. It's a flawed gem of a series that sometimes tends to ride a bit too hard on brand name recognition alone and not enough innovation or effort trying to bring in new people. Tekken's barrier of entry with the huge roster and gigantic move lists is already high, boring the bejesus out of newcomers is the last thing they should do.
    Ryu,Ken and Luke burst with personality? major reason i skipped SF6 was all the og characters just look aged and not much else. all the new characters however are totally unique and interesting imo
>Azucena doesnt interest you at all? 

Are we not in agreement that she is a poorly designed? Visually her main outfit is extremely boring and her personality is essentially a meme. I dont mind her existence but there is no way she is grabbing the attention from outsiders. Well I guess none of the 3 new characters do.
    yeah noticing a divide here i wasnt aware of all the new characters from Vincent to Azucena look really good to me didnt know people thought they were boring
        They are not boring to me, but if I was a tekken outsider none of them would catch my eyes at all. They are unknown characters that dont seem very exciting.
Man, I despise Azucena. Maybe I'm old, but she's kinda a cringe, cheap gen z Fortnite dance single note meme character. To each their own, though, obviously
Azucena mixup machine with very annoying sounds probably a reason to drop game, not play it.
Oh yeah Azucena does interest me too and her inclusion does show that the team are on the right track of making more distinct characters. But then you also have Victor who encapsulates all the problems I have with Tekken designs too so it's a step forward and a step back.
Nah I agree. The roster itself in terms of size is great, but it is missing the certain something. We have no new character that stands out for non-tekken players and the ones we have are just....too many mishimas/karate-type characters. Characters with different fighting styles and body shapes are missing, such as Bob, Lei, wang.

It's not a big problem for me because tekken is and always will be my fighting game, but the reason for that has never been the roster tbh and I feel like if we want to keep the popularity going that we started to get with T7 with need some more oomph in the roster. Hopefully the dlc characters can fix this AND - I know oldasses dont want to hear this - have those characters not be marduk, anna and AK who all have similar characters already in the game and are unmarketable to the non-tekken crowd.

Lets bring those characters in after T8 is buzzing due to having completely wild guests like T7 did.
Iconic characters with an unique fighting style I'd say. There is too much "Karate A, Karate B".
So characters like Lei, Marduk, Eddy/Christie, and Josie/Bruce would make the base roster look more attractive.

If we had to remove characters then cramp the bears into 1 slot. Still crazy to think that they're excluding so many great fighters. Then remove devil Jin and make him unlockable or dlc. Or become devil Jin in-game when you make a special move like with Kazuya. 

And we could also get a 3rd free slot if we remove Lars. He is just a sad excuse for swedish representation. And the game really doesn't need this many Mishimas. We can't both have Lars and Jun, so pick your poison Harada.

Fit in Lei's drunken boxing, Eddy's dancing, and some Kickboxing figther and I would personally be sold on the roster alone.
The trash ass characters like Lei, Christie, Wang. Only actual good characters missing are Marduk, Anna, and Julia.
    Since when is Lei a trash character?  Lol.
    Lei is an iconic charecter that I don't know why they always put in dlc
Quanity doesn't make everything. SF6 has fewer characters, but provides the most depth any of those characters have ever had in the series, thus offering different methods and ways to play each one. It's a perfect balance of quantity and quality, making matchups far more easier to learn and creating one of the most balanced vanilla fighting games in history. They worked the roster from the ground up whilst Tekken's changes to their veteran characters aren't as significant in comparison, especially animation wise, though that's a nitpick, it plays a factor with reviewers like the one in the top post.
Sorry, where exactly does he say that?
    "While Street Fighter 6 seemed to take joy in rendering all kinds of exaggerated, athletic silhouettes, Tekken 8’s men all share a handful of bodies on the spectrum"

using terms like "rendering"  in the context of character graphical design is a comparison between the two graphically

substitute SF6 for MK1 in the article and it would be a low blow idk why its different here, tekken is realistic while sf6 goes for a stylized toon look shouldnt be compared at all
        He makes a very specific comparison between one element of each games character design sensibilities, youre reaching to say he was making any kind of overall statement about either games graphics. But sure tell everyone else not to jump to conclusions.
Honest question based on your take, and I am aware many agree with you... But, I spent an hour last night switching back and forth between SF6 and Tekken 8 on PS5. To my eyes, SF6 animations appeared remarkably more fluid, and the textures more polished, crisp, less grainy, higher framerate (which I don't think is true but describes my perception). What am I missing
    street fighter 6 has way less going on then Tekken; not saying this results in a better game because SF6 offers an extremely quality experience with smooth animation like you mentioned. Tekken has to factor in destructible environments, fully interactable 3-D range, character textures change at a very detailed level throughout the battle as they take physical damage to body and clothing, the scope of the backgrounds (sf6 has a fully animated background as well but not like t8 with an entire cityscape in the background or planets moving). 

style, fluidity,smooth, these are the words that come to mind for SF6, while T8 for me is scale, detail, and realism (not saying SF6 doesnt have all these traits and again its frustrating author brought up SF6 as his example of whats "good" because they really both did an amazing job)

as far as how many people agree with me its really not the mob of blind support you'd expect with a massive launch like T8, many here expressed good opinions on why its not the perfect game id made it out to be and thought it was. id say its around a 50/50 split on positive vs negative based on the feedback. its been a while
Oh no, you don't agree with someone else's opinion.
    all right great contribution thx 🙄
Bro, reread your post.
    we're talking about graphics what conclusions am i jumping to lmao the game objectively has a better graphic system.
Thanks for the reply. It’s good to hear that there’s a robust training mode, because I’ll certainly need it, haha. A year isn’t so bad in the grand scheme of things. I’ll just have to be patient, remember to learn from my opponents, and take it one step at a time.
That's fair.
fr, what is this hakan slander. That dude was cold
An opinion is only valid if it’s backed up with valid facts. 

When they make shit up and then use that as their own opinion, that’s no different from spewing bullshit. 

Readers like you is what’s wrong with gaming reviews today.
Jak 
Panda
Kuma
Leroy
King 
Yshimitsu
Yeh they all look Japanese and hailed from Japan 
Gameplay made street fighter what it is not dhalsim or blanka.
That article is stupid.
    Jak is fair


Panda and Kuma are the same body type so it should count as one copy and pasted


Leroy has the same body type as everyone else, he's just an old dude. Not like Dhaslsim who's an old dude AND can stretch his limbs mad far.


King isnt the imposing figure physique wise. He's 6'3, not the 7'0 beats Zangief is where his forearm is the size of a character's head.


Yoshismitsu? I don't think it's the article that's stupid, bud. Yoshismitsu has the same body type as every other character. No, the armor doesn't count since it's just that: armor, not body type.


Compare that to SF6, which has Marisa, Zangief, Lily, Blanka, Chun-Li, etc. Everyone is much more diverse than Tekken body wise and design wise. Their designs ooze with personality, which Tekken struggles with, especially here.


(Also, you're VERY wrong about the gameplay making SF. Mad casuals to this day quote "yoga flame!" And "Hadoken!" As well as pick a wild animal character like Blanka.)
I read it more and yeah I see what he means. Still the story at least in T8 has come a long way. It’s pretty awesome seeing it be cinematic they could had just as easily never done it. It’s great for what it is I get some want improvements and well in due time. I’m just happy we got Tekken Ball back can’t wait to play it 🏐
The article overall isn't bad but the author's character taste is questionable at best. He labels Victor as being Colonel Sanders. IMO Victor's design is completely badass. Meanwhile he is in love with the anorexic flamingo known as Manon.
writer brought up some good points its not a hit piece the guy does know tekken. but there's so many non issues he decided to include i cant understand his point that streey fighter 6 roster is beaming with personality & looks amazing while tekkens is getting too "swole and shredded" or "faces are "indistinct" 😐 tekken 8's graphics for maps and characters are leagues better then tekken 8 i just dont see where he's coming from there. as far as gameplay and online there are issues i can see that
I think it's crazy to suggest T8 isn't bringing in new players. The marketing alone will do that, but the game's wider breadth of content and features, as well as the highly improved training tools and Special Style controls, will go further in getting more people into Tekken than probably even T7 did. 

Their budget and scope for T8 is way higher, and it shows.
The thing is Tekken 8 has 30 years of existence. What can they do to bring in more new players? They are doing that by the way. Just that anyone who is into Tekken has been a longtime fan and that’s honestly a huge support and why the series has made it this far. Eventually even new fans become old fans can’t keep trying to recreate the wheel as they say. T8 is still fresh and new plus new faces too that older fans may not exactly like them but newer fans do. So everyone is being catered to and might I add there is a full blown tutorial with helpful tips. Then there is special style that is directed at new players. I think my comment wasn’t exactly clear on this my bad.
Yeah I initially liked MK1 a good amount, but over time it really lost me. The seasonal mode is hot garbage. I couldn't even finish the first one because it was so repetitive and easy it was. I wasn't improving anything about my play by going through it, so I didn't care. 

Also, the gameplay... Can't explain it, but there is just something really frustrating about MK1 in comparison to the ones before it. Which is too bad because the roster is really great.
I played the new one and man it’s sad that’s actually true. MK1 definitely feels rushed for sure.
Woahhh huh? I thought the general consensus was that mk 1 gameplay was good
    I can’t speak on MK1 that much but lately been seeing a bunch say it’s dying. Even Max brought it on his YT so something is off with MK1 at least by those who play it competitive.
    it is indeed better than 11, but not better than MKX or any others. ironically, the concurrent players of 11 and X are even higher than MK1
I agree.

Keep Tekken out of your mouth.
    Makes no sense whatsoever, but ok. It's just cringy when people use phrases such as "objectively bad" based on their opinions.
        Nah.

What’s cringy is failing to see objective truth for the failings of your own blatant bias.

But you do you.

I’m sure you will.
            Lol okay. Entertain me then, what's the argument that it's an objectively bad game?
It is up to you to defeat your own bad habits.

Kick your own rocks.

You can do it, man.

Smoke ‘em.

Get crackin’.

Or rather don’t, in the contextual vernacular.

But do, if they help you cope with Tekken 8.

I guess?

Up to you.

*shrug*
I think it's going to be a struggle for returning players more than new players. Returning players are going to have to learn to stop playing as Defensive as they have since pretty much forever, while new players won't have that issue.
    Exactly. TMM at first was very annoyed about Kazuya changes, saying how bad he is, but recently came around realising that Kaz is no longer just a turtle and a punish bot. He can actually pressure with some of his tools.
        I feel like every character is going to be like that once people start learning them. Jin actually looks fun in this game to me and I haven't touched a Mishima at all in Tekken 7.
            I will smash you with Jin and allow you a rematch and let my 10 year old fight the first round in a bamboozling fashion. It's actually a handicap cos he always loses at my level 🧐

*Crackles with lightning*
        >TMM

Im new to Tekken. Whats TMM?
            TheMainManSwe. The Tekken dad. Kazuya main, one of the bigger Tekken streamers and youtubers.
                gotchu thank you
    It is never going to be a struggle for old players compared to new in Tekken. It still has the bloated move list and you still have years of frame memory and match up knowledge.
        been punishing fools 25 years brother
    Nobody likes to watch defensive play style even sf6 is more aggressive work the drive system. Granblue versus rising gives you a strong way to break a defense. Defensive is boring to play against and watch.
        I think a good, solid defense can be a lot of fun to watch when the offensive tools are just as good as the defensive ones. 

but yeah, in fighting games especially a good defense can be a bit boring to watch.
        Nobody likes to watch mashing play style too.

Tekken so popular exactly because it have working defensive play style.
            I have yet to see this "mashing play style" in any of the competitive matches I've seen of Tekken 8, the game isn't even out yet and top level players haven't even gotten to play that much. Give it a bit for the actual play style to develop. 

it's so weird seeing this game get praised review wise but suddenly shit on right before release.
                I want to notice that "mashing play style" is exaggeration when people compare T7 and T8. It's THAT bad, but something many don't like.

If you want to see difference, watch T8 Knee Feng vs T7 Knee Feng  matches.

Like this:

Just compare amount of time characters stay in neutral/bkdish around.
        I like how you say NOBODY likes it just to make it seem like you have a stronger argument.
            Can't argue with fighting games becoming more aggressive. Even a card game like Magic The Gathering has taken away slow play styles like draw go control. Overwatch 2 took away the second tank. It's not just fighting games
        SF6 is a bad game. It is a horrible FG. It is a shite SF game.
        the only reason i got into tekken 7 and watched it was because of the movement system. i love watching very defensive games, i think thats where the system shines
    Tekken 8 is designed for casuals and people who don't like fighting games. They've ruined the gameplay which explains why its getting high reviews pandering to the noobs who previously were getting destroyed due to the high skill ceiling 
    A very polite way of saying harada fucked it lmao 
        the game isn't even out yet and you're saying he fucked it? how, elaborate? 

People have been complaining about Tekkens turtle always defend style of gameplay for a while, and Harada listened and tried to make the game more aggressive, and it seems he's succeeded, so how did he fuck up?
            His ruined it by casualising the game. So many franchises have been ruined for pandering to casuals 
            > the game isn't even out yet and you're saying he fucked it? how, elaborate?

It's for sure not complete over, but you don't need to be Professor to see how each character got pressure tools. Like more mixups, pluses with heats, and so on.

And you don't need to be a professor to watch matches awaiwable for month, for all ranges of skills, to compare to current tekken. Watch for example Knee Feng in T8, then T7, and tell me pace of the game didn't changed to be much more aggressive.
                At the end of the day it’s 60 bucks for a game that has mid netcode and none of the stuff that myself or other legacy players like about tekken, we already have tekken 3 rollback that runs perfectly and will hopefully soon see fightcade integration, ppsspp is getting rollback soon so we will have DR, the question is do I want to pay full price for a game I know I won’t like and that isn’t what legacy players want in a tekken game 
                    The question aren't about you (not trying to be rude, just explaining). It's about game alternative.

Mate, look, Tekken 3 can not compete with anything modern. You have to joke to call it playable compared to T7.

T7 might be 'alternative'. In theory. But in practice, it won't have enough players. T7 already was unplayable for solid part of players outside of prime-time, and it will become dead after T8 for sure.

So, there is basically two outcomes. You either doesn't play fighting games at all, or you play T8.
                        that's not even remotely true. every other franchise has lively legacy scenes. i can get games on SF2X much faster than i could in the last year of tekken, GGAC+R has has a very active player base since it got rollback in 2020. this idea that no one is playing the old game just isn't true. in saying that tekken never had the support street fighter, kof, guilty gear ever had. while capcom, snk and arcsys have been updating legacy games with modern netcode for modern audiences (capcom is barely on this list in fairness) namco have done... nothing. there is no means to play old tekken games until very recently. and still no means for matchmaking outside of discords. this is due to change with fightcade integration but it's a slow process.   


outside of that tekken 3 not being playable ? really ? the game is great. and tag 1 fixed alot of the issues t3 had (at the cost of the balance admittingly.) but it's still really fun with alot of viable characters.. and as already mentioned has better netcode than tekken 8 which is full price. that's the main point. how can namco ask for full price when they haven't even added decent netcode.
            Because it sucks lmao, drive rush in tekken, backdashing is EVEN WORSE than it is in T7, the balance changes force the game to be much more unga bunga while still not building the game to be actually fun on offense

And even outside of the netcode is confirmed by people with review copies to be bad. Tekken 3 has fluid rollback and there is updates on ppsspp rollback for DR every day. I’m not spending full price for a bad tekken game with bad online when I can play the better ones for free with better netplay 
Absolutely it worked. Never touched tekken a day in my life, have maybe 100 hours total in 2D fighters. Just hopping on and mashing a bunch of buttons in random order is hella fun. And no I’m not 9 years old
    Do you mash buttons for all fighters?
        No. I take a couple 2D fighters seriously enough to truly learn and get decent. 3d fighters are not my thing typically but I’ve still had fun with t8 just fucking around with friends without really trying too much. Basically I’m the target audience of their changes I guess was the point
    This game is designed for Fortnite braindead kiddies rather than Tekken fans. If you just wanna bash buttons then go ahead and enjoy. I'm sticking with Tekken 7 which actually requires skill
        Tekken 8 has a lot of depth, just like Tekken 7. You are allowed to dont like the changes. But to say that it requires no skill... is just wrong and stupid. Doesnt make any sense at all.
It seems to offer a lot more accessibilities to new player for sure. However, apart from pulling off cool looking moves from a fluke here and there, I say that's as good as any new comers will ever be.

Saying this as someone who hasn't played since TTT. Almost 20 years lol. I CAN mash buttons and pull off some nice moves but on my first day on demo I can't even beat the arcade mode lol. I had to look up poking games and relearn some combos to make progression.
    Most new comers won't stay that's true, it's going to be the same thing it always is, dedicated new players who decided to try and learn the game. That won't change, they just have more tools to do so in the full game from my understanding.
I had the same worries until I watched some PhiDX commentary on T8 matches. He’ll clearly state that a match is a good T7 match or T8 match, depending on how the competitors utilize the new mechanics. So now I have a good grasp on when to use my heat, how to retain it and use it to its full potential.
this is how i interpret the opinion too. you cannot change the challenge of getting people to commit to learning something which is niche.

having tools to learn more smoothly and quickly is really great, but you have to already want to use the tools for it to matter. something people who are totally new to the genre probably don't care about.

people are much too quick to dismiss opinions that find any fault.
Strive has awesome tutorials. They could be more in-depth for certain mechanics but the fact that they have one for Kara cancels and other character specific tricks is pretty neat.
    ye i didnt mean strive, i think it was xrd
The Training mode is really good, with the ability to reset during actions to train for specific set ups and the normal training mode things. the replay system gives you tips for how to improve mid replay and even lets you play through parts of the replay to help you learn how to handle a situation better. 

the arcade mode thing also teaches you the game as you play. I've never played Rev 2, and I don't doubt it has a really good training mode. 

But again, based on the limited fighting games i've played (SF5, SF6, MK1, MK11, Injustice 2, Soul Calibur 6, DBFZ, GGStrive, BBTag) it has the best training *tools* of any fighting game i've seen.
    Sorry, i misinterprated tools for beginners learning.

Yeah, youre right everything is there for a great system
        My bad for typing it the way I did; I think some people thought I meant the lab/training mode/combo practice when I meant everything the game throws at new players.
There are more game modes I think
    SF6 has 35 combinations of match types from extreme battle alone. Add that to different variations of team battle, regular battle, avatar battles and the retro game cabinets.
Yepp this is true. Someone else mentioned that this is for customization purposes which makes sense but begs the question if we should sacrifice that sort of body diversity for the sake of having our bread costume not clip through our character :/
    Especially when we can’t even have t6 costumes. I was so excited damn
I don't think SF fans care about legacy characters as much. You can point out how small the SF6 roster is, meanwhile they will point out how little of T8 is new characters.
That's when TK was at its best. When the character designs were based on certain properties from the 80s, 90s, and early 2000s. But since T6, they've just been putting anything and everything in a blender like it's generic modern anime.
    Honestly Tekken has barely evolved from Tekken 1. Its literally the same game with better graphics. The problem is they have barely chabfed it enough not that they are trying everything 
Ryu,Ken and Luke burst with personality? major reason i skipped SF6 was all the og characters just look aged and not much else. all the new characters however are totally unique and interesting imo
yeah noticing a divide here i wasnt aware of all the new characters from Vincent to Azucena look really good to me didnt know people thought they were boring
    They are not boring to me, but if I was a tekken outsider none of them would catch my eyes at all. They are unknown characters that dont seem very exciting.
Since when is Lei a trash character?  Lol.
Lei is an iconic charecter that I don't know why they always put in dlc
"While Street Fighter 6 seemed to take joy in rendering all kinds of exaggerated, athletic silhouettes, Tekken 8’s men all share a handful of bodies on the spectrum"

using terms like "rendering"  in the context of character graphical design is a comparison between the two graphically

substitute SF6 for MK1 in the article and it would be a low blow idk why its different here, tekken is realistic while sf6 goes for a stylized toon look shouldnt be compared at all
    He makes a very specific comparison between one element of each games character design sensibilities, youre reaching to say he was making any kind of overall statement about either games graphics. But sure tell everyone else not to jump to conclusions.
street fighter 6 has way less going on then Tekken; not saying this results in a better game because SF6 offers an extremely quality experience with smooth animation like you mentioned. Tekken has to factor in destructible environments, fully interactable 3-D range, character textures change at a very detailed level throughout the battle as they take physical damage to body and clothing, the scope of the backgrounds (sf6 has a fully animated background as well but not like t8 with an entire cityscape in the background or planets moving). 

style, fluidity,smooth, these are the words that come to mind for SF6, while T8 for me is scale, detail, and realism (not saying SF6 doesnt have all these traits and again its frustrating author brought up SF6 as his example of whats "good" because they really both did an amazing job)

as far as how many people agree with me its really not the mob of blind support you'd expect with a massive launch like T8, many here expressed good opinions on why its not the perfect game id made it out to be and thought it was. id say its around a 50/50 split on positive vs negative based on the feedback. its been a while
all right great contribution thx 🙄
we're talking about graphics what conclusions am i jumping to lmao the game objectively has a better graphic system.
Jak is fair


Panda and Kuma are the same body type so it should count as one copy and pasted


Leroy has the same body type as everyone else, he's just an old dude. Not like Dhaslsim who's an old dude AND can stretch his limbs mad far.


King isnt the imposing figure physique wise. He's 6'3, not the 7'0 beats Zangief is where his forearm is the size of a character's head.


Yoshismitsu? I don't think it's the article that's stupid, bud. Yoshismitsu has the same body type as every other character. No, the armor doesn't count since it's just that: armor, not body type.


Compare that to SF6, which has Marisa, Zangief, Lily, Blanka, Chun-Li, etc. Everyone is much more diverse than Tekken body wise and design wise. Their designs ooze with personality, which Tekken struggles with, especially here.


(Also, you're VERY wrong about the gameplay making SF. Mad casuals to this day quote "yoga flame!" And "Hadoken!" As well as pick a wild animal character like Blanka.)
I can’t speak on MK1 that much but lately been seeing a bunch say it’s dying. Even Max brought it on his YT so something is off with MK1 at least by those who play it competitive.
it is indeed better than 11, but not better than MKX or any others. ironically, the concurrent players of 11 and X are even higher than MK1
Makes no sense whatsoever, but ok. It's just cringy when people use phrases such as "objectively bad" based on their opinions.
    Nah.

What’s cringy is failing to see objective truth for the failings of your own blatant bias.

But you do you.

I’m sure you will.
        Lol okay. Entertain me then, what's the argument that it's an objectively bad game?
Exactly. TMM at first was very annoyed about Kazuya changes, saying how bad he is, but recently came around realising that Kaz is no longer just a turtle and a punish bot. He can actually pressure with some of his tools.
    I feel like every character is going to be like that once people start learning them. Jin actually looks fun in this game to me and I haven't touched a Mishima at all in Tekken 7.
        I will smash you with Jin and allow you a rematch and let my 10 year old fight the first round in a bamboozling fashion. It's actually a handicap cos he always loses at my level 🧐

*Crackles with lightning*

Im new to Tekken. Whats TMM?

            gotchu thank you
It is never going to be a struggle for old players compared to new in Tekken. It still has the bloated move list and you still have years of frame memory and match up knowledge.
    been punishing fools 25 years brother
Nobody likes to watch defensive play style even sf6 is more aggressive work the drive system. Granblue versus rising gives you a strong way to break a defense. Defensive is boring to play against and watch.
    I think a good, solid defense can be a lot of fun to watch when the offensive tools are just as good as the defensive ones. 

but yeah, in fighting games especially a good defense can be a bit boring to watch.
    Nobody likes to watch mashing play style too.

And you don't need to be a professor to watch matches awaiwable for month, for all ranges of skills, to compare to current tekken. Watch for example Knee Feng in T8, then T7, and tell me pace of the game didn't changed to be much more aggressive.
    At the end of the day it’s 60 bucks for a game that has mid netcode and none of the stuff that myself or other legacy players like about tekken, we already have tekken 3 rollback that runs perfectly and will hopefully soon see fightcade integration, ppsspp is getting rollback soon so we will have DR, the question is do I want to pay full price for a game I know I won’t like and that isn’t what legacy players want in a tekken game 
        The question aren't about you (not trying to be rude, just explaining). It's about game alternative.

Mate, look, Tekken 3 can not compete with anything modern. You have to joke to call it playable compared to T7.

T7 might be 'alternative'. In theory. But in practice, it won't have enough players. T7 already was unplayable for solid part of players outside of prime-time, and it will become dead after T8 for sure.

So, there is basically two outcomes. You either doesn't play fighting games at all, or you play T8.
            that's not even remotely true. every other franchise has lively legacy scenes. i can get games on SF2X much faster than i could in the last year of tekken, GGAC+R has has a very active player base since it got rollback in 2020. this idea that no one is playing the old game just isn't true. in saying that tekken never had the support street fighter, kof, guilty gear ever had. while capcom, snk and arcsys have been updating legacy games with modern netcode for modern audiences (capcom is barely on this list in fairness) namco have done... nothing. there is no means to play old tekken games until very recently. and still no means for matchmaking outside of discords. this is due to change with fightcade integration but it's a slow process.   


outside of that tekken 3 not being playable ? really ? the game is great. and tag 1 fixed alot of the issues t3 had (at the cost of the balance admittingly.) but it's still really fun with alot of viable characters.. and as already mentioned has better netcode than tekken 8 which is full price. that's the main point. how can namco ask for full price when they haven't even added decent netcode.
Because it sucks lmao, drive rush in tekken, backdashing is EVEN WORSE than it is in T7, the balance changes force the game to be much more unga bunga while still not building the game to be actually fun on offense

And even outside of the netcode is confirmed by people with review copies to be bad. Tekken 3 has fluid rollback and there is updates on ppsspp rollback for DR every day. I’m not spending full price for a bad tekken game with bad online when I can play the better ones for free with better netplay 
gotchu thank you
I want to notice that "mashing play style" is exaggeration when people compare T7 and T8. It's THAT bad, but something many don't like.

If you want to see difference, watch T8 Knee Feng vs T7 Knee Feng  matches.

Just compare amount of time characters stay in neutral/bkdish around.
