Well if you were worried about too many Dragunov, Feng and Azucena there are no worries.


Interesting character pool
    Yup. Good variety. 

Seems drag isnt strong enough to be a free win in pro play, compared to the whole Leroy shenanigans way back.
        ft2 format just like online ranked lol 

it's anyone's game at that point

a few right/wrong 50/50's and it's over
            Damn, maybe you should have gone and compete there, you would have a 50-50 chance of winning.
                You always have a 50/50 chance of winning though

You either win or lose
                    Just like the lottery.
                        See, you win or lose (but usually lose)
                    You can also draw albiet unlikely so its 33.333333333...%
                        See you got a 33 1/3 chance of winning, but I, I got a 66 and 2/3 chance of winning, because Kurt Angle KNOWS he can't beat me and he's not even gonna try!
                            The numbers spell Disaster!
                        But you actually have a 50/50 chance of drawing though. You either draw or dont draw.
            That’s literally fighting games and has been since the jump. You capitalize on your options and make risky moves to get an edge.

It’s always been like this, if it was anyone’s game you wouldn’t have dominant top players lol.
            It’s always ft2.. ? Even when it was Leroy’s top 8
            Have you ever seen a tournament before?  It’s always best of 3.  These are all top level pros.
                Criticize something for being badly designed/implemented

"It has always been like this" 

FGC is so used to consuming feces fed to them that they defend it by saying they have always been fed feces
                    What are you yapping about?  Literally in every major fighting game tournament, you have to win a total of 6 rounds.  Whether that’s winning 2 matches with 3 rounds each, or winning 3 matches with 2 rounds each.  

With hundreds to a thousand of entrants, you think there is time for everyone to run a first to ten?  Being able to adapt quickly is a key skill in high level play.
                        You're again defending the thing by saying it has always been like this

Each round is 60seconds max btw

It's not about being able to adapt quickly it's about being able to award the best player the win, a 6 round game especially in Tekken 8 with many 5050 forced moments does not do that very well
                            No, dumb dumb.  I’m defending it because it’s logical, and only a freakin moron would suggest otherwise 😂
                                > Literally in every major fighting game tournament, you have to win a total of 6 rounds.

You don't even know what you said
Here is top fifty for those interested:

[https://www.eventhubs.com/news/2024/apr/25/evo-japan-2024-results/](https://www.eventhubs.com/news/2024/apr/25/evo-japan-2024-results/)

In terms of which characters prospered and which didn't, in top fifty there were:

9 Fengs (18% pick rate - highest placement: joint 9th)  
6 Victors (12% pick rate - highest placement: joint 13th)  
5 Hwoarangs (10% pick rate - highest placement: joint 25th)  
4 Bryans (8% pick rate - highest placement: joint 17th)  
4 Azucenas (highest placement: joint 9th)  
4 Dragunovs (highest placement: winner's bracket)  
4 Lilis (highest placement: winner's bracket)  
3 Juns (6% pick rate - highest placement: joint 33rd)  
3 Kings (highest placement: joint 25th)  
3 Claudios (highest placement: joint 9th)  
2 Alisas (4% pick rate - highest placement: winner's bracket)  
2 Eddys (highest placement: joint 7th)  
2 Jacks (highest placement: joint 17th)  
2 Jins (highest placement: joint 9th)  
2 Kumas (highest placement: joint 13th)  
2 Laws (highest placement: loser's bracket)  
2 Lars's (highest placement: joint 33rd)  
2 Ninas (highest placement: winner's bracket)  
2 Xiaoyus (highest placement: joint 17th)  
1 Lee (2% pick rate - highest placement: joint 33rd)  
1 Leroy (highest placement: joint 49th)  
1 Raven (highest placement: joint 25th)  
1 Reina (highest placement: joint 9th)  
1 Steve (highest placement: joint 49th)  
1 Shaheen (highest placement: joint 33rd)  
1 Zafina (highest placement: joint 33rd)  
0 Asukas  
0 Devil Jins  
0 Kazuyas  
0 Leos  
0 Pauls  
0 Pandas  
0 Yoshimitsus

Bear in mind that a handful of players played several characters and therefore didn't necessarily advance to the top 50 off of the strength of one.

Of particular note is that 72% of players played one of the top 7 characters (Feng, Victor, Hwoarang, Bryan, Azucena, Dragunov and Lili). 7 characters (Asuka, Devil Jin, Kazuya, Leo, Paul, Panda and Yoshimitsu) are entirely absent. So complaints about a certain lopsidedness in viable characters are seemingly not without merit.
    2 Lars we win these
        BUT DEN3 IS SO BROKEN, RIGHT? NERF LARS, APE CHAR ASDSDFSGSGDH
            Clearly all our moves look the same and we should be reverted to our Tekken 7 state, smh... if you disagree you are not a true and honest player like me (I spend 500 hours in practice mode doing electrics)
                Hear you loud and clear. SEN1 is now -10 on block again.
                    Should be -15 minimum
    Who was the raven?
        You can see the names in the link. :)
        Gotta be pinya right?
            Tissuemon was in the tournament also
                Didn’t know that. It was still definitely pinya though lol
                    Pinya played Victor surprisingly.


The Raven who made top25 is Bobby. An up and coming player from Australia
    9 Fengs ?! How this character is popular in tournaments and unpopular online ?!
        Because people don’t like fengs design. Drag is cooler and higher tier in most peoples mind
            He's got one of my favourite designs in the game lol. Favourite male character with Leroy, Dragunov, and Raven.
                Yeah chinese kenpo master is cool but for the most part Dragu is cooler for more people
            Literally. He's too ugly for his own good. 
        Chu mean unpopular online. Make it to high ranks and you see feng every match cause too many players are pathetic tier whores
        I do face feng pretty often in ranked. Feng, jin and king gotta be the top 3 in my matches
        I am trying to put feng in my pocket collection, but I find him syrupy and hard to combo with.
            Really? I play 7 characters and Feng has the easiest combos in my opinion of all of them. Very basic inputs, no timing issues, most of them follow similar paths.

These might not be optimal, but they're plenty of dmg and very easy. I put the tornado, ender in italics so you can see how they're all basically the same thing just with different filler. All of these do at minimum 63 dmg, while some of them are in the high 70s.

#starter 1: (basic uf4 combo)

* uf4
* f3,4
* ws3

start > 3,3 > *df4,2,1+2 T! > uf3 > 3,1+2*

#starter 2: (you can do a more damaging f3,2 with these for filler)

* c.dash 1 CH
* c.dash 2
* STC 1

starter > f3,2 > *df4,2,1+2 T! > uf3 > 3,1+2*

#starter 3: (these are your early tornado combos if you do tornado right away)

* df3
* ss4
* db4
* BKP 3
* ws2 CH 
* low parry

start T! > (dash forward) uf3 > b3 > 1 > db1,2,4

Those should be enough to get you started, if you want to see my full cheat sheet I have it in my Feng tab [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a0K2BqRMwmQLfQKSQHjF8MjJJozWiJZ_GYmoxaJsejM/edit#gid=247170507)
    Devil Jin is top 5 boys. And Kazuya is even better than that!
        The entire top 51-100 consists of nothing but Devil Jin!
    Thank you for taking the time to do this !
        NP! I'm the type of weirdo who enjoys it.
    Even tho we cannot make a tier list off of this i think there are a few things we can note:

Reina is one of the most popular characters out there. She should have been played a lot. There's only 1 reina there yet this sub is crying about nerfs lol. 

Nina is underrated as hell here. She's easily top 5, maybe even top 3. This sub seem to either forget about her or downplay her cause she's got a low playrate, but she's an insane character rn.

Claudio's also downplayed a lot on this sub, yet he's had low but consistent pickrate at every tournament i watched and now evo too. I think people are sleeping on this character because he requires good fundamentals.
        Leo is heavily slept on also. I’m sure a migration will happen eventually. Definitely a top 10 character.
            I agree. I heard he's being played a lot in the higher ranks tho.
        You gotta figure that on the sub we have maybe a few hundred players who are high rank and the vast majority is anywhere between green and purple. Those ranks are very flow chart heavy and a lot of players will fall for stuff that a high rank player won't. Leading to alot of crying for nerf posts when all the high rank people know that they're just whining cause they got beat. People think they're better than they are and will blame just about anything else before they ever blame themselves
        >Nina is underrated as hell here. She's easily top 5, maybe even top 3. This sub seem to either forget about her or downplay her cause she's got a low playrate, but she's an insane character rn.

Which is really funny. There was a slew of tier lists being upload on YouTube like a month ago by high rank players and they all put her in S-Tier. Like the information is right there. If people don't want to listen it's their own fault.
        I absolutely agree with you about Nina. She's a hidden top tier that people forget about. You know who else used to be that? Julia. She was always a hidden top tier that people didn't notice because she's "boring". Then T7 made her dlc and THAT brought eyes to her.
        If you listen to Spag's heatcast episode from a couple of weeks ago, all the Koreans were picking out Nina as top 5. The perception of Nina being strong is not at all new to the Asian scene.

Claudio has also been brought up several times as potentially very strong.
            Yeah it's just this subreddit. I've heard people say claudio is bottom tier here. But i guess they also said kazuya was one of the worst characters in the game when in reality he's doing fine rn.
                Yeah this sub has a bad habit of thinking low pickrate = bad character. The amount of people I see say Shaheen and Claudio are bad is baffling.
                    So, what exactly makes Claudio good? I’ve only got a few hours of playtime with him, and I honestly couldn’t figure out what might make him particularly strong in this game. I’ve got even less playtime with Shaheen, but I can understand why he’s good. Ironically enough, Claudio has my highest win rate, but I feel like that was almost purely on knowledge checks.
                        He's got very good fundamental stuff. He's got the best hopkick in the game as an exemple. He's got good movement, he's got decent keepaway, he has good frames, etc.
                The idea of Claudio being bottom tier is crazy. He's preserved pretty much everything he had from T7 (where he was top 10 at the end of the game's lifespan) and his heat is completely bonkers.
                    Wouldn't say he's completely preserved. Most of his CH launchers no longer ch launch like B33, F3, UF3 and 4. They also removed ff1+2 which was a really strong addition. UF 3+4 doesn't pick up consistently anymore. B1 and F3 doesn't screw mid-air opponents anymore.

His new DP move is absolutely ridiculous though.
                        That isn't really any different to what other characters lost - including several of the ostensible top tiers. Most characters had several CH launchers stripped out and lost mid-air screws. He's still fundamentally intact and kept his best moves, including b1 and SS4.

I also think his heat is among the best in the game. Spammable starburst and a low (only -14 ob) heat smash combine to make him incredibly scary in heat.
                        blue moon?
        Not only on this subreddit. People in one Tekken stream really said that Reina and Alisa were top ten and that Claudio and Nina were an honest low tier character like lol.
        Reina being underrepresented in top 50 might be due to the same reasons she loses a lot in ranked: She is so common people know the matchup.
            Reina has a lot of things that make her very much competitively unfavorable:

Trash lows
Very few plus frames
Very high execution requirement
Unfavorable 50/50s

Her presence at  Evo isn't due to people knowing the matchup. We're talking about the best players in the world here. Everybody knows pretty much every matchup. It's because people know Reina isn't really tournament viable.
            It may be, i think she's just a heihachi 2.0 tho. She's not gonna be tournament viable after a while. Maybe a bit more than heihachi, but when you look at the character's frame and techs... Other mishimas just do more than she does if we consider that both players are insanely good. 

Ff2 on block is a losing situation for reina, her 50/50 mixup game doesn't lead to combos, heavens wrath is only good at the wall...
                How is ff2 on block a losing situation?
                    Because you can either be very minus or go into sentai mixup.

From sentai mixup if ff2 got blocked your opponent can make it a 50/50 by defending with duck/powercrush. Reina's hardest hiting option from sentai hits for i believe 40, if you duck or block a sentai move that's vulnerable to it you're getting a full combo. So it's disadvantageous because overall it will lead to more dmg for you than for reina. 

On top of that, you can just jab which trades with sentai 3 and beats everything else (maybe not the low option tho) if you don't want to take any risk. And again on top of that you can backdash which beats most of the options with the exception of i believe sentai 3+4 (the low) sentai 4 (flip kick) and sentai 1+3 (grab), but both sentai 4 and sentai 1+3 are reactable so doing that you can pretty much only get hit by the low. This doesn't work on every character but i'm pretty sure it works on most of them. 

She has options to deal with everything tho, like sentai into nothing if she expects a powercrush. But the deepness of the mindgames involve isn't viable. Like, what's the point of doing 10 feint in a row if at worst your opponent can chose to jab and the worst thing that can happen to him is he gets hit by a ~20 dmg low?
    He'll yeah Xiaoyu represent! Hope to see her more in T8
    0 Devil Jins

  
i crai

    Holy shit, this joint guy plays everything!
    No asuka :(
        Not surprising, she is very weak rn, but also not really unpopular so she cant get away with people not being familiar with the matchup.
            I thought her parried would be easy noob killers. But everyone just spams power crushes in my noob bracket :'(
                The parries doing grey damage just ruins the risk reward IMO. So many times I finally get my opponents timing, land the parry followed up with a full combo, only for them to regain almost all that health if I make a mistake. Hopefully she gets some buffs real soon.
        She is one of the weaker characters right now, I guess. On the positive side, they might buff her after this. :)
        Many people used her, just didn’t get to top 50, that’s why this list is meh
    I call bullshit, I watched both days so far and this is skewed, why not list all characters chosen?  There were multiple Leo’s. A yoshimitsu, a metric fuckton of King players, a much larger size of eddy, Azu and Drag, multiple Zafina’s, half a dozen xiayous, let’s talk about the elephant in the room.  There were FOUR characters simply never chosen.  They are : Panda, Paul, Devil Jin and Kazuya.
        These are the players who made it into the top 50. I don't know anything about the general pick rate of characters across the entire tournament.
    Paul is top 3 and no one played him wow....
        Paul is not top 3 lol or close, I’ll assume this is a joke.
            Paul is not top 3 but he is very underrated. Him, law and lili are top-tier characters that nobody really talks about that much.
                Idk about all the chief. I’d put him below both of the others. What do you think makes him top?
                    He has all of the tools you need in T8. And his damage is absurd. He kills in two touches which is super important in my opinion.
                Law and Lili are both really strong characters rn tho. Paul kinda normal.
                    Nah people be sleeping on him. He does so much damage and has so many nasty setups. Just nobody plays him. Bummer the pakistani paul couldnt come to evo he wouldve bodied people left and right.
        Top 3?! What a take
Thailand…we need to train harder. Book needs stronger competition to get him over the edge. Juiestorm and Shin Akuma, we are proud too.
2 Laws on Top 6, interesting.
    Double and Mangja's matches being back-to-back on stream was crazy. Just destroying everyone in losers.
    Two of the best Laws in the world too.
    They're both losers.
        They're part of the top 6 but in the loser bracket. They fight the one who loses at the winners bracket. If they can win they can still be the champion.
            Was a cringy ha-haa joke with the double meaning, but the law players took it personal heh
                Nah, it just wasn’t funny.
                    Now I took it personal
Let's go Chikurin!
    Yes yes!!

    3:30PM JST time on monday.

https://www.start.gg/tournament/evo-japan-2024-presented-by-rohto/event/evo-japan-2024-tekken-8-2/brackets?filter=%7B%22phaseId%22%3A1636310%2C%22perPage%22%3A1%7D
Did tekken master not play Lars I thought that’s his main ?
    Every match I saw, he was playing Eddy.
        Ah damn I was looking forward to watching his Lars he used to main Lars literally just before this
            Watch one of his eddy matches and you can see why he's using him for tournament.
                man he had some fun matches, I'm amazed he pushed chanel to a final game as well as beat yagami who was playing really well this tourney
    Is this the same Tekken master as the one who's a pro in mortal Kombat?
        Yes
        Yup
Is there an easy way to check character usage across the board?
Rooting for Chanel and Chikurin
Did Knee participate?! AK?! I think Alisa have big chances to win :)
    AK lost to Knee and Double, Knee lost to Chikurin and Yagami
        dang i gotta find that ak versus double match
        Am I so dense Evo Japan was last night and I missed it?
            Sort of Day 1 was Saturday morning til Night, Sunday was 10am to \~4pm with a lunch break (JST time), but day 1 was only barely streamed and like half of losers in day 2 were completely off-stream.

Tomorrow is top 6.
                ah okay, perfect. thanks.
    Knee lost before top 8 to Chikurin and I forgot who the other person was.
        he lost to yagami which was a aussie reina player unfortunately most if not all of his matches were off stream and he got eddy gordo’d by tekken master
    Knee was beaten 2-0 by Lili player (chikurin)
    They did. Got eliminated in the pools
We're jdcr and ulsan there? If so im surprised to not see them in top 8
    JDCR lost to Lowhigh on stream, then got eliminated by Saint offstream.

  
Ulsan lost to Mulgold then Yagami
        Yagami is an Australian player and had a crazy run. Knocked out Knee, Ulsan, and Pinya before finally falling to Tekken Master
    Uslan was T17 and JDCR was T25.
    JDCR hasn't been at the top of the mountain for a while now, no surprises with this top 6 tbh
        JDCR was a top performer in all of the korean tournaments so far, what are you talking about? He just won the last ATL lol
            Fair enough
The fengs lost earlier than I expected.
    I think KNEE switched to Drag and was eliminated by Chikurin.
        Chikurin sent him to loser, he was later eliminated offstream by Yagami. There was a cam stream of it, he was playing Feng against Yagami's Reina.
            Ah gotcha. 

Missed that part. This tournament is NOT kind to EU viewers.
            [deleted]
                it's not just "some lili," it's chikurin. lmfao.
                    Juhdicur moment
                Chikurin's not just some random b-level player that caught Knee unawares -- he also knocked Knee into the loser's bracket en route to winning the Tekken World Tour Finals in 2019.

                        >maybe

Lol what

                                >will it help if I add /s

It would, actually. Cunt. No sarcasm in mine.
Where then any yoshis?
    Eyemusician can't compete until later this year due to mandatory military service.
    I wish eyemusician was there his yoshi is really fun to watch he would’ve definitely made top 50 too
        Eyemusician would have IYOOOOOOOO so hard in this EVO.
Who knocked out Knee?
    Chikurin and Yagami.
I think a lot of people forget that what's strong in ranked BO1 ladder is not always the strongest in tournament BO3. Drag is a very linear character. Give it a couple rounds and a lot of people can adjust to it. Azu has 3 problematic moves, not hard to prepare for. Feng is strong period, but he's "honest" to an extent. His downsides show when you can play against the same one over and over.
    It is not that people forgot, they see tier lists and/or their own experiences and think that it applies to everything. I had a friend who claimed that Drag vs Azu was going to be in Evo Japan too and that Alisa and Yoshi were both broken
Sad no Jimmy J
    Ye he lost against meo-ils victor I believe but he did hit a taunt jet upper 😂🤷🏻
        I didnt even know jimmy played, just seeing his name pop up was hype for me. His bryan made so many good reads but Victor just 5050d him to death
    You have footage of his matches for a friend? He keeps bugging me for his matches.
        Someone already uploaded some of Jimmys matches to YouTube. Not all with who exactly he is playing with but every match so far he had was entertaining AF
            Link? So my friend can shut up?
                https://youtu.be/EvG31Fb0U0U?si=Bf-m-QlcPcSjMF9H

Some more should appear in recommended after this link
                    Tyvm. He has been asking me for almost a week for Jimmy and I told him over and over again I will do it when I see him lol.
So Law is the real problem here
I want Chikirun to win but I don’t want Lili to get nerfed 😂🫡 pretty fun games to watch, been watching the K-Wiss + Joka restream. The drags and Azucena’s are real boring, glad it’s dropped off at this point outside of lowhigh.
Makes sense honestly. Nina, Alisa, and maybe Lili are all slept on pretty hard.
    Nina has been put by pros in s tier since the start. Alissa and lili have been A tier on those same lists. It's just this sub that struggles with remembering things.
        Alisa and Lili are definitely S tier. There’s a few characters from everyone’s list that are overstated that don’t belong in S. Kuma is not bottom tier also. The early tier lists are way off and was just a couple of guys following each other’s personal opinion.
            I wouldn't put those 2 in s yet. They aren't quite as good as feng, drag, Nina, etc.
                Lili is almost purpose-built for tournament level play. Strong tracking, strong movement (in fact, she's the only character in the game who can step out of certain setups), great mid-pokes and lows, a solid-50/50 game, and zero execution requirements so you can't fuck any of it up under pressure.
                    Yeah she's a good tournament character, but still  not s tier. I feel like she's not oppressive enough to be s tier.
                        I dunno man. There might be a case for it. I can't actually think of any weaknesses she has in T8.

Historically, it was her tracking, but her tracking is extremely good in T8. She also has top-tier mix.

I personally think she's better than at least 2 of the commonly cited S-tiers in tournament play.
                            Yeah probably. Imo the only definitive s tier so far are feng (he just has everything, perfect character), drag (mostly because of his dmg) and Nina. And i feel like she isn't as good as they are. Compared to king, azu, etc tho? Yeah sure, she belongs with those.
                                My hot take is that Feng is the best character in the game, followed closely by Drag and Nina. 

Ling, King, and Jun are overrated and won't hang in the top tiers long term (especially if Namco nerfs a few key moves).

Lili, Alisa, Law, and Claudio are all underrated.
                Alisa’s chip damage is oppressive and her evasion is good along with ranged 5050s she’s definitely up there. Nina’s NCC d4,3,4 is something else along with her armor heat engager that’s helping. I’d kick Ling out of S. Don’t think she belongs there and place these 2 in it.
                    Ling yeah, i don't think alissa's quite s tier tho
                        I played a GoD Alisa yesterday. Never has she been so oppressive in any other Tekkens and been fighting a lot of decent Alisas since T6 arcade days. It's all guessing game. Some heat chain saws setups you can do nothing but block and take the chip since she's so plus on block . She has plenty of 5050 options if you guess wrong its over. I feel she's 100% S tier.
                            Yeah maybe i guess. She's very good for sure.
        I have been saying this for ages that Nina, Alisa, and Lili are good but nobody listens to me so I stopped bothering.
    Lili is legit a problem, super slept on.
        not at all ? She's always in A tier in tier list, she has very strong combos and good 50/50. She's clearly not "slept on".
        Since the matchmaking change I’ve been playing nothing but lilies, like nonstop. She’s super good.
    I BEEN SAYING LILI IS A WALKING NUCLEAR BOMB
    Every waifu is a problem but Asuka and zafina, anybody noticed that?
Who eliminated CBM? He was doing so well in Korea
    Jeondding did it, here is the iphone stream of that match: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ8tg\_zuTvE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ8tg_zuTvE)
        And he did so well against rangchu fucckkkkk
        I gotta find more of these streams. There weren’t enough official ones!!
Super hyped to see Lili in top 8! She’s super strong but has a high skill ceiling imo, you can’t just spam plus frames you actually have to earn your turn with good movement and whiff punishes
Turns out this sub was 🗣️ABSOLUTELY WRONG.
    To the surprise of absolutely nobody
    no way
    Yup. Reddit and Twitter Tekken players are exaggerating balance issues. What they are experiencing does not represent absolute reality. If you look at other tournaments, there is a greater diversity of characters than in Tekken 7.

Numan recently won with Steve in a tough Pakistani tournament. Kuma has won various tournaments, etc.
    Bro the dumb fucks in this subreddit just parrot the ramblings of whatever streamer they consider to be their god. They have 0 ability to think independently or critically.

I guarantee you, the nanosecond some of these streamers look at the data and change their opinion, this sub will follow. We can’t expect these people to critically evaluate the data—we have to wait for their gods to tell them what to think.
    Somebody was right: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Tekken/comments/1bjmplb/comment/kvtkaed/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tekken/comments/1bjmplb/comment/kvtkaed/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
    Based on a single tournament? That's certainly a take.
        Multiple tourneys have had character variety like this. This is just the first big international one.
            Not really. The most competitive tournaments so far are the korean ATL ones which had drag and azucena as most picked characters.

That aside, character variety needs context, it makes no statement about the balancing of characters. Of course the eddy main is going to pick eddy again, of course the law main is going to pick law and so on. The vast majority of players stick to their main unless one character is so much better than everyone else that you cant compete.

Also his take doesnt reference character variety but balancing. This sub and every pro under the sun kept saying azucena and drag are too good. It's such a classic reddit take to say that this has been invalidated because of one tournament. Even if there were no drags in the top 32 this take would still be nonsensical and a fallacy.
                Pakistan is a competitive scene. In the recent offline tournament, their top 8 have variety.  It's won by Steve player. ATL also has been won before by CBM Jin. Lowhigh and Knee have not won ATL despite using Dragunov .There are many tournaments without Dragunov in the top 8 and Dragunov is not dominating tournaments. As I mentioned a balancing issue is exaggerated by online Reddit warriors like you..


Sub is absolutely wrong as they are expecting many Dragunovs and Azucenas in the top 8.
                    This comment is the perfect example of what I am talking about. You're making balancing assumptions based on nonsensical things and without context.

The reason why in pakistan drag doesnt win every tournament is because the best pakistan players do not play dragunov.

>Lowhigh and Knee have not won ATL despite using Dragunov

JDCR won ATL with dragunov and ATL had drags in every single top 8. Once again this is one of those fallacies where ONE player ONCE didnt do well and therefor his character is actually not that strong? What are those leaps in logic?

Also knee is obviously out of the race. Doesnt matter if he plays drag, lili or feng, he is not good at T8 yet compared to the other top koreans. 

>There are many tournaments without Dragunov in the top 8 

Again, when a tournament takes place and 0 good dragunov players attend you cant use that as a fact against dragunov not being good. A 7 year old would understand this. We have a drag in top 8 all the time in ATL because there actually are dragunov players in korea. Now in evo japan we have 4 drags in top 50 which is already an overrepresentation of a character as there are 33 and one of them is in top 8. Also one of the drags happened to put another top drag into losers, we mightve ended up with 2 drags in top 8 otherwise.

Also wasnt the electric clash final we just had drag vs azucena in the finals? lol.

>Sub is absolutely wrong as they are expecting many Dragunovs and Azucenas in the top 8.

Without knowing who will attend evo japan sub was 100% correct to assume a lot of drags and azucenas will do well. Pakistan not getting their visas as arslan wouldve likely competet with azucena and jondding switching from azucena to eddy despite suggesting that he probably wont already eliminates some placements.

If anyone wouldve told you arslan ash, ulsan, JDCR, lowhigh and jondding would make it top 8, you wouldve unironically said that seems improbable?
                        Tournament results are context data and sensical. You are grasping for straw. You are just being stupid.

Not only one player, Knee and Lowhigh played Dragunov but did not win ATL. JDCR finally won ATL after 5 ATL. As I said Dragunov is not even dominating Tekken 8 tournaments 

The fact is Dragunov is not dominating tournaments. Yup this sub is wrong. Many here predicted multiple Dragunov in the top 8 in Evo Japan.

You are salivating on 4 Dragunov in top 5. So from top 8 you stretched it top 50  to sound you have an argument.You are looking silly again. 4 Dragunov in top 50 is not over representation. Of course you expect Dragunov players like Nobi and JDCR  to at least make top 50. Don't be so stupid.

Multiple tournaments have a variety in the top 8. You are just again stupid. 

Correction no Dragunov won a tournament in Pakistan.
                            >Tournament results are context data. You are grasping for straw

No, thats what you are doing. You're going: oh this one guy plays dragunov only got to the finals twice and only one one of the tournaments out of fucking 64 of the literal best players on earth, therefor the character he plays must not be that good. Thats you. Youre saying this.
                                Nope. You are just stupid. What I said plenty of times overall Dragunov is not dominating tournaments. That's facts and data.Tournament results are context data and sensical. You are grasping for straw. 

You are salivating on 4 Dragunov in the top 5. So from top 8 you stretched it top 50  to sound you have an argument.You are looking silly again. 4 Dragunov in the top 50 is not over representation. Of course you expect Dragunov players like Nobi and JDCR  to at least make the top 50. Don't be so stupid.


MANY IN THIS SUB MENTIONED THAT there will be many Dragunovs and Azucenas in the top 8 at Evo Japan. They are WRONG.
    Except the top comment here proved that it wasn't. In top 50, 72% of players played the same 7 characters.
I said it weeks ago, Chikurin was gonna hit top 8 with Lili. 

Here we are. Lili mains, it's our time.
    Why would you be happy about this? There's nothing fun in playing a character that's considered strong
Didn't expect Chanel on top 8 let alone winner side too at all
    Aww cmon, don’t sleep on Chanel.  And this game really fits his playstyle
Am surprised infested did this well considering he's a meme in Korea because of his poor results 😅.
    He was, but recently Korean fans have started to notice that his form suddenly went up.

&nbsp;

Probably because he finally found the character (Nina) that suits him the most.
Everybody real quiet now huh, I'm still surprised about the lack of drag tho.
    That is how it be.
Would really love a Law player to win. Was RIP the last Law winner for unofficial EVO? 2011 Tekken 6
Wow a Nina in Winners. Sucks to be on the east coast though, I won’t be able to watch live
Wait, who eliminated Kaizur :(
Is Arslan somewhere?
    He and other Pakistani players couldn't make it due to visa issues.
        Oh that is unfortunate. Thank you
        Its always the visa smh arslan did say getting a visa was harder than fighting at evo
        AGAIN???
            Yes, but this time it seems to be because the embassy moved making it harder to get the situation handled.
Shout out my boy FTwilight for providing extra streams on twitch last night in the venue when EVO stream was down! You guys should go follow him.
still upset no pakistanis could play
    If this was traditional sports, they wouldn't have had those VISA problems we see all the time in Esport :/
Big character spread across the whole tournament people rlly exaggerated tier stuff
Xiaoyu obviously overpowered.
    I was looking out for Mr. Croft and Yordez. Croft did better with T7 Xiaoyu and surprised Yordez finished so low since he probably the best Ling in the world. Wecka scraped by a King I’m not familiar with to get top 17. But yeah Ling is decent but she’s not S tier that everyone is complaining about. Probably just shy outside the top 10.
        You and I should both watch more YUYU, she did super well
            She has always been solid.
    I love how all of the dumbos now crawl out of their holes with their disingenious told-you-sos. When none of the good players play xiaoyu because they dont like her that does not mean she isnt good.
        She’s not S tier for sure. She’s more of the middle of the pack. Arslan gave up on her for a reason. There were some Ling players that had strong showings with her in T7 that placed lower here. The guy that beat knee and Arslan a few times finished 33. Outside of heat, she still has major problems with reach and pressure and can still be turtled to death by defensive players.
            She is S-tier for sure. Arslan did not give up on her lmao, he never intended to play her. There simply isn't a top-tier ling player right now. That's all there is to it. 

>The guy that beat knee 

And knee didnt even finish top 50, whats your point?
                Such cognitive dissonance.
I'm all for Infested and LawHigh.
Seems like reddit/twitter was wrong after all, no random ass player who got lucky is in top 8 and no Drag vs Azucena top 8 finals.

Knee's church in shambles right now.
Hoping Infested Win. Rare to see Nina.
Wow.. does this mean King deserves another buff? (because in all encounters he is in losing situation)
    I watched a video that analyzed King, and Lil Majin was reacting to it, and it said that King is only really good at lower levels. Lil Majin was agreeing with it btw.
    Moreso a lot of playstyle change tbh.

A lot of high level players having a habit of just trying to fish for throws or just not using any other throws other than the 2 signatures (GS and SW). Both of these playstyle are wrong in a way.

If you only fish for throws, eventually you are gonna be duck launched and got beat very quickly. This is mostly noob level mistake and would then let to the other wrong playstyle due to overcorrection.

The overcorrection is to only use GS and iSW for offense and mix-up, while completely forgot King's crouch throws and other easier imput throw (like Muscle Buster) and opted for mostly shove and strike to counterhit. This throws out the real reason why King is strong: counter throw. Throw now tracks, counter throws now having nearly unbreakable break window and actually are unbreakable if you punish/counter powercrush (including heat burst and rage art) and crouch throws are now truly unbreakable still with the 12f start-up. So you actually want to play more defensive at the start and constant counterhit the opponent with your 3 fast throws (GS and SW are 10f, MB is 11) so that they will have to choose to use lows to beat you, which allows you to use crouch throws to catch them doing it. After that, when they start to play defensive, NOW you are using your strikes to engage and forcing them into stand blocking with your mid barrage, and then throw them when you have got them conditioned.

That type of gameplay sounds more like Tekken 7, but that's the point.
What about JDCR and Father? Did they both join too?
    JDCR was taken out in pools by lowhigh and someone else. Father unfortunately didn't participate because "his Tekken 8 isn't very good"
        Ah thanks. Father sounds humble
Anyone knows about kaizokulars?
    Sent to losers by PINYA, elim by SAINT
Where can I watch the matches played?
No Leroy? Wtf
Hey, Victor and Hwoarang are pretty good at winning!
Thank you for posting this! I wish Evo Japan and Liquipedia both did better with showing which characters are being played
Love to see my Lee is still a niche specialist even after everyone was saying he’s easier
Curious about the pakistani players, did they get eliminated early on or did they not go?
    they couldn't go due to visa issues
    VIsa issues, they didn't attend
Nice to see the character diversity after all the doom posting. I had fun watching yesterday. Chikurin has looked really on point so far. He could win it all.
Cool top 8, it would've been very different if Pakistan was allowed in though.
See I told you guys Xiaoyu was weak, we need to buff her!!
Knee is washed and finished?
Woooo Chikurin!!! 🎉👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼

Suck it, 50 iq bitches.
The fact that there is only one Drag in finals and only four in top fifty is hysterical. 

Everyone with a bit of skill already knew how linear and predictable he was and the pro players just proved it. 

Will the hive mind complainers on this sub pivot towards Law now? 
    I mean Drag's objectively top 3, I don't think the fact that Akuma was played by like 2 guys in Worlds back in T7 changed that he was top 1 by a large margin. Neither does EVO japan make Drag not a top 3 character, all it shows is that player skill matters more than the character unlike T7 S3 Leroy.

I mean there were moments in the Knee vs Chikurin set where Knee clearly did not know the proper combo conversion after getting certain CH or off-axis launches.
        Exactly, player skill matters so much more than the character and the Evo top 8 has proven it. 

If you were to look at this sub over the past month, you’d have thought the top 8 would be nothing but Drag and Azucena.

Nice to see the pro players destroy the Reddit scrub narrative. 
            Azu got a nerf to her objectively strongest move, that kind of killed the momentum for her. I don't think it's a scrub narrative to say drag is objectively very strong. Even the pro's are saying it.

EDIT - Added the words kind of
                I don’t think that’s what op is saying. Yeah drag is strong but he’s really not as bad as this sub is chirping about.
                    He is as bad as this sub is claiming him to be. Pros say he is OP but he is even stronger on our level, in regular ranked play he is simply the best character in the game.
                        So why is there 1 in top 8? He’s a very easy character to pick up, if he was objectively that good pros would be playing him heavy.

Obviously this is one tournament but it begs the question. He honestly might be the best character but it’s clear that it’s not that insurmountable as people are making it out to be.
                            >So why is there 1 in top 8? He’s a very easy character to pick up, if he was objectively that good pros would be playing him heavy.

Do I really have to answer this? Like is this a serious question? Okay ill try and not be toxic here, but I hate super dishonest takes like this. You're just pretending that the player doesn't matter, nobody - and I stress again NOBODY - said that drag is an autowin. On planet earth. It just helps, that's all. The vast majority of players still pick their fighter based on who they like playing, not everyone immediately jumps to top-tier to invalidate the work they put in into their main for 20 years.

>He honestly might be the best character but it’s clear that it’s not that insurmountable as people are making it out to be.

Again, nobody on planet earth and possibly the entire universe said this. Everyone is in agreement, pros and bads alike, that drag is a tad too strong and a top 3 character. That's it. You are making up a narrative that you can then do a "gotcha" against or something. Nobody said drag is like leeroy. Nobody.
                                Did…you forget the whole original comment? We were talking about the primarily online takes of people in this sub talking about drag’s power level. I’m not making up a narrative it’s literally what we’re discussing in this thread.
                                    >The fact that there is only one Drag in finals and only four in top fifty is hysterical. 
Everyone with a bit of skill already knew how linear and predictable he was and the pro players just proved it. 
Will the hive mind complainers on this sub pivot towards Law now?

You mean this terrible take? 

>I’m not making up a narrative it’s literally what we’re discussing in this thread.

No, nobody said this. Not in this thread either.
            >Exactly, player skill matters so much more than the character and the Evo top 8 has proven it. 

No, evo top 8 has not proven anything, not just because its just one tournament, we also already knew that player skill matters more?! Like we needed proof for that lmao. Nobody said player skill isnt the most important factor, otherwise we wouldve seen randos in the top 64.

>If you were to look at this sub over the past month, you’d have thought the top 8 would be nothing but Drag and Azucena.

Not just did some of the drags play each other, the two best azucena players either couldnt join the tournament or they swapped characters. The way the tournament went we couldve easily have had 4 out of top 6 be either of the two characters. It just ended up not happening which is really not a statement about how good those characters are. 

>Nice to see the pro players destroy the Reddit scrub narrative. 

It's not a reddit narrative, its the pro players that kept saying drag and azucena are OP.
    Brother the same people complaining about dragunov were also the people thinking that Victor will be a top pick at EVO. People just refused to lab him in the first months but now everyone's got Dragunov figured out, even in low ranked.

JDCR being T25 with his Drag is concerning, though apparently he lost to LowHigh and from what I've seen JD has a hard time in mirror matches against him.
        >Brother the same people complaining about dragunov were also the people thinking that Victor will be a top pick at EVO. 

Uhm...who is going to tell him lol

>JDCR being T25 with his Drag is concerning

How is this concerning, he literally just lost to another dragunov.
    No, they will just keep whining about Feng


If Feng not actually being played online didn't stop them, not being played on tournaments wouldn't either
        Not the Feng downplay bro
            Hearing that from a King is exceedingly ironic
                [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tekken/s/lA1orH6ckH)
In my opinion, Law is easily a top 5 character, but people always put him in A tier. I wonder if the lists will change after the tournament
    I think Double and Mangja were just really on point. A lot of good reads on defense and good placements of df2 and slide mixups. Nothing really insane character wise.
        I personally think they should have never removed the DSS cancel, now the character has access to insane pressure and brutal frames for free, in prior games you had to just-frame that shit (ws4 dss for example).
            ws4 dss feels fucking insane in T8 lol
            WS4 DSS wasn't a just frame, except for 3+4,4. You did have to be on point in execution not to be beaten out by jabs though where now it's easy to save the frames.

  
What really made it stronger now is that you can just press df to instantly go into crouch slide in previous games that was really tight because you had to cancel the stance first then immediately do the motions for crouchslide.
    I think he's suffering from Feng syndrome. This is the ugliest version of Law ever. Veiny, ugly, annoying, loud. 
Does this mean I’ll see more mirror matches in purple now? 😁
The tiers are way closer than this sub would have you believe (lmao).

The game is frustrating yea, but it’s not because of the balance imo it’s the systems.

Drag and feng are both really strong obviously but people really expected this to be evo jpn with 6 leroys in top 8 again. My top 5 tbh is something like this:

Drag
Devil Jin
Feng
Nina
Lee

Maybe Lili sneaks in there if I’m being honest.
    So is Devil Jin just based on your own hatred for the character? Because there was not a single DJ in the top 100. 
        I don’t hate DJ at all. He objectively has all the right tools and more to be a contender for top 5.
            Yet he is not. He did not even make it to the top 50 and the last tournament I watched, lost early on. Lee/Jun/Asuka/Zafina/Alisa went further.
    >Drag Devil Jin Feng Nina Lee

Lmao not a single DJ in top 100 and the red ranks are still crying. Truly something else.
        I’m not red rank homie, or crying, this is just my feeling on the character.

Edit: to expand upon it here’s why I (just me mind you) think that.

-excellent movement
-very very buffed throw game in a game that throws are important
-great plus frames that go into stance.
-tracking on a lot of safe options
-great combo damage

These things plus the game that 8 is, imo make him very very strong. He can almost do no wrong in heat, if a very capable player is in their bag imo he deserves the spot.
            >I’m not red rank homie, or crying, this is just my feeling on the character.

Jesus, you can't even make to red ranks? No wonder you think this. DJ is a trash character but at your level he's probably God tier.
                Adorable.
        I don't think DJ is that good right now but tournament results are never the be all end all. During TTT2 era and parts of T7 DJ was unanimously considered top tier by everyone but he barely showed up in top 8s. Reason being, why pick a technical char when an easy one is just as strong?
            >During TTT2 era and parts of T7 DJ was unanimously considered top tier by everyone but he barely showed up in top 8s.

You really should sit down and think for a while about what you wrote here.
                What's the issue with what I wrote? An obviously strong but technical char was lacking in tournament results.
    Devil Jin is the most overrated char. He's already been nerfed twice and barely top 10 at this point, not even the best Mishima and you could make an argument he's the worst of the 4. Ask any high level Mishima player and they'll tell you that Jin and Kazuya are better (Reina is up for debate).
    You forgot jun
An argument can be had for eddy and victor as well
Guess the dlc announcement is tomorrow then
Wow 0 Pauls, I need to drop him  man 🤣
    Don't do it. Unga Bunga play style is too much fun
eddy gang
Enough cheese to clog one's arteries
it don't matter how many ninas there are in top 8, it don't matter if she's the worst character in the game, i will still call for nerfs. i want her to be so bad that picking her makes ur PC start downloading strive
#bufflars, like for real, can people stfu now about Lars? He still sits deep in the dumpster
Wow. I actually thought there would be nothing but Drags and Fengs.
    Drag and Feng aren't overpowered, they're just very strong. It's just this sub that would make you think otherwise as people substitute their lack of character knowledge with complaints about severe balance issues. Anyone who said that the top 5 characters in this game are anything close to T7's Leroy at launch are too shit at this game to know what they're talking about.
    According to these stats its a lot of drags and fengs tho?
All I see is cheese. Cheese everywhere.
    Yeah man if only the best players in the world used skill 😤
na and eu tekken so bad cant even get top8 in a low skilled game and without pakistan
    Taken aside that na and eu have NEVER been on the same level as korea in history of tekken, this tournament is evo japan. 90% of the competitors are japanese and korean. Most of the best european players didnt go, in fact some of them played in a completely different tournament that happened at the same time.
        copium na and eu are just bad
    Pakistanis are the ones who kill the Koreans in pools so without them it's over
        Chikurin last hope
            I hope Double wins
not to diminish LowHigh, because he's really gpod, but winning with Drag isn't impressive
    It's evo, winning with anyone is impressive.
    What’s impressive is you say this, but wouldn’t last a second in a match with him, no matter the character 😂
Yup. Good variety. 

Seems drag isnt strong enough to be a free win in pro play, compared to the whole Leroy shenanigans way back.
    ft2 format just like online ranked lol 

it's anyone's game at that point

a few right/wrong 50/50's and it's over
        Damn, maybe you should have gone and compete there, you would have a 50-50 chance of winning.
            You always have a 50/50 chance of winning though

You either win or lose
                Just like the lottery.
                    See, you win or lose (but usually lose)
                You can also draw albiet unlikely so its 33.333333333...%
                    See you got a 33 1/3 chance of winning, but I, I got a 66 and 2/3 chance of winning, because Kurt Angle KNOWS he can't beat me and he's not even gonna try!
                        The numbers spell Disaster!
                    But you actually have a 50/50 chance of drawing though. You either draw or dont draw.
        That’s literally fighting games and has been since the jump. You capitalize on your options and make risky moves to get an edge.

It’s always been like this, if it was anyone’s game you wouldn’t have dominant top players lol.
        It’s always ft2.. ? Even when it was Leroy’s top 8
        Have you ever seen a tournament before?  It’s always best of 3.  These are all top level pros.
            Criticize something for being badly designed/implemented

"It has always been like this" 

FGC is so used to consuming feces fed to them that they defend it by saying they have always been fed feces
                What are you yapping about?  Literally in every major fighting game tournament, you have to win a total of 6 rounds.  Whether that’s winning 2 matches with 3 rounds each, or winning 3 matches with 2 rounds each.  

With hundreds to a thousand of entrants, you think there is time for everyone to run a first to ten?  Being able to adapt quickly is a key skill in high level play.
                    You're again defending the thing by saying it has always been like this

Each round is 60seconds max btw

It's not about being able to adapt quickly it's about being able to award the best player the win, a 6 round game especially in Tekken 8 with many 5050 forced moments does not do that very well
                        No, dumb dumb.  I’m defending it because it’s logical, and only a freakin moron would suggest otherwise 😂
                            > Literally in every major fighting game tournament, you have to win a total of 6 rounds.

You don't even know what you said
2 Lars we win these
    BUT DEN3 IS SO BROKEN, RIGHT? NERF LARS, APE CHAR ASDSDFSGSGDH
        Clearly all our moves look the same and we should be reverted to our Tekken 7 state, smh... if you disagree you are not a true and honest player like me (I spend 500 hours in practice mode doing electrics)
            Hear you loud and clear. SEN1 is now -10 on block again.
                Should be -15 minimum
Who was the raven?
    You can see the names in the link. :)
    Gotta be pinya right?
        Tissuemon was in the tournament also
            Didn’t know that. It was still definitely pinya though lol
                Pinya played Victor surprisingly.


The Raven who made top25 is Bobby. An up and coming player from Australia
9 Fengs ?! How this character is popular in tournaments and unpopular online ?!
    Because people don’t like fengs design. Drag is cooler and higher tier in most peoples mind
        He's got one of my favourite designs in the game lol. Favourite male character with Leroy, Dragunov, and Raven.
            Yeah chinese kenpo master is cool but for the most part Dragu is cooler for more people
        Literally. He's too ugly for his own good. 
    Chu mean unpopular online. Make it to high ranks and you see feng every match cause too many players are pathetic tier whores
    I do face feng pretty often in ranked. Feng, jin and king gotta be the top 3 in my matches
    I am trying to put feng in my pocket collection, but I find him syrupy and hard to combo with.
        Really? I play 7 characters and Feng has the easiest combos in my opinion of all of them. Very basic inputs, no timing issues, most of them follow similar paths.

These might not be optimal, but they're plenty of dmg and very easy. I put the tornado, ender in italics so you can see how they're all basically the same thing just with different filler. All of these do at minimum 63 dmg, while some of them are in the high 70s.

#starter 1: (basic uf4 combo)

* uf4
* f3,4
* ws3

start > 3,3 > *df4,2,1+2 T! > uf3 > 3,1+2*

#starter 2: (you can do a more damaging f3,2 with these for filler)

* c.dash 1 CH
* c.dash 2
* STC 1

starter > f3,2 > *df4,2,1+2 T! > uf3 > 3,1+2*

#starter 3: (these are your early tornado combos if you do tornado right away)

* df3
* ss4
* db4
* BKP 3
* ws2 CH 
* low parry

start T! > (dash forward) uf3 > b3 > 1 > db1,2,4

Those should be enough to get you started, if you want to see my full cheat sheet I have it in my Feng tab [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a0K2BqRMwmQLfQKSQHjF8MjJJozWiJZ_GYmoxaJsejM/edit#gid=247170507)
Devil Jin is top 5 boys. And Kazuya is even better than that!
    The entire top 51-100 consists of nothing but Devil Jin!
Thank you for taking the time to do this !
    NP! I'm the type of weirdo who enjoys it.
Even tho we cannot make a tier list off of this i think there are a few things we can note:

Reina is one of the most popular characters out there. She should have been played a lot. There's only 1 reina there yet this sub is crying about nerfs lol. 

Nina is underrated as hell here. She's easily top 5, maybe even top 3. This sub seem to either forget about her or downplay her cause she's got a low playrate, but she's an insane character rn.

Claudio's also downplayed a lot on this sub, yet he's had low but consistent pickrate at every tournament i watched and now evo too. I think people are sleeping on this character because he requires good fundamentals.
    Leo is heavily slept on also. I’m sure a migration will happen eventually. Definitely a top 10 character.
        I agree. I heard he's being played a lot in the higher ranks tho.
    You gotta figure that on the sub we have maybe a few hundred players who are high rank and the vast majority is anywhere between green and purple. Those ranks are very flow chart heavy and a lot of players will fall for stuff that a high rank player won't. Leading to alot of crying for nerf posts when all the high rank people know that they're just whining cause they got beat. People think they're better than they are and will blame just about anything else before they ever blame themselves
    >Nina is underrated as hell here. She's easily top 5, maybe even top 3. This sub seem to either forget about her or downplay her cause she's got a low playrate, but she's an insane character rn.

Which is really funny. There was a slew of tier lists being upload on YouTube like a month ago by high rank players and they all put her in S-Tier. Like the information is right there. If people don't want to listen it's their own fault.
    I absolutely agree with you about Nina. She's a hidden top tier that people forget about. You know who else used to be that? Julia. She was always a hidden top tier that people didn't notice because she's "boring". Then T7 made her dlc and THAT brought eyes to her.
    If you listen to Spag's heatcast episode from a couple of weeks ago, all the Koreans were picking out Nina as top 5. The perception of Nina being strong is not at all new to the Asian scene.

Claudio has also been brought up several times as potentially very strong.
        Yeah it's just this subreddit. I've heard people say claudio is bottom tier here. But i guess they also said kazuya was one of the worst characters in the game when in reality he's doing fine rn.
            Yeah this sub has a bad habit of thinking low pickrate = bad character. The amount of people I see say Shaheen and Claudio are bad is baffling.
                So, what exactly makes Claudio good? I’ve only got a few hours of playtime with him, and I honestly couldn’t figure out what might make him particularly strong in this game. I’ve got even less playtime with Shaheen, but I can understand why he’s good. Ironically enough, Claudio has my highest win rate, but I feel like that was almost purely on knowledge checks.
                    He's got very good fundamental stuff. He's got the best hopkick in the game as an exemple. He's got good movement, he's got decent keepaway, he has good frames, etc.
            The idea of Claudio being bottom tier is crazy. He's preserved pretty much everything he had from T7 (where he was top 10 at the end of the game's lifespan) and his heat is completely bonkers.
                Wouldn't say he's completely preserved. Most of his CH launchers no longer ch launch like B33, F3, UF3 and 4. They also removed ff1+2 which was a really strong addition. UF 3+4 doesn't pick up consistently anymore. B1 and F3 doesn't screw mid-air opponents anymore.

His new DP move is absolutely ridiculous though.
                    That isn't really any different to what other characters lost - including several of the ostensible top tiers. Most characters had several CH launchers stripped out and lost mid-air screws. He's still fundamentally intact and kept his best moves, including b1 and SS4.

I also think his heat is among the best in the game. Spammable starburst and a low (only -14 ob) heat smash combine to make him incredibly scary in heat.
                    blue moon?
    Not only on this subreddit. People in one Tekken stream really said that Reina and Alisa were top ten and that Claudio and Nina were an honest low tier character like lol.
    Reina being underrepresented in top 50 might be due to the same reasons she loses a lot in ranked: She is so common people know the matchup.
        Reina has a lot of things that make her very much competitively unfavorable:

Trash lows
Very few plus frames
Very high execution requirement
Unfavorable 50/50s

Her presence at  Evo isn't due to people knowing the matchup. We're talking about the best players in the world here. Everybody knows pretty much every matchup. It's because people know Reina isn't really tournament viable.
        It may be, i think she's just a heihachi 2.0 tho. She's not gonna be tournament viable after a while. Maybe a bit more than heihachi, but when you look at the character's frame and techs... Other mishimas just do more than she does if we consider that both players are insanely good. 

Ff2 on block is a losing situation for reina, her 50/50 mixup game doesn't lead to combos, heavens wrath is only good at the wall...
            How is ff2 on block a losing situation?
                Because you can either be very minus or go into sentai mixup.

From sentai mixup if ff2 got blocked your opponent can make it a 50/50 by defending with duck/powercrush. Reina's hardest hiting option from sentai hits for i believe 40, if you duck or block a sentai move that's vulnerable to it you're getting a full combo. So it's disadvantageous because overall it will lead to more dmg for you than for reina. 

On top of that, you can just jab which trades with sentai 3 and beats everything else (maybe not the low option tho) if you don't want to take any risk. And again on top of that you can backdash which beats most of the options with the exception of i believe sentai 3+4 (the low) sentai 4 (flip kick) and sentai 1+3 (grab), but both sentai 4 and sentai 1+3 are reactable so doing that you can pretty much only get hit by the low. This doesn't work on every character but i'm pretty sure it works on most of them. 

She has options to deal with everything tho, like sentai into nothing if she expects a powercrush. But the deepness of the mindgames involve isn't viable. Like, what's the point of doing 10 feint in a row if at worst your opponent can chose to jab and the worst thing that can happen to him is he gets hit by a ~20 dmg low?
He'll yeah Xiaoyu represent! Hope to see her more in T8
0 Devil Jins

Holy shit, this joint guy plays everything!
No asuka :(
    Not surprising, she is very weak rn, but also not really unpopular so she cant get away with people not being familiar with the matchup.
        I thought her parried would be easy noob killers. But everyone just spams power crushes in my noob bracket :'(
            The parries doing grey damage just ruins the risk reward IMO. So many times I finally get my opponents timing, land the parry followed up with a full combo, only for them to regain almost all that health if I make a mistake. Hopefully she gets some buffs real soon.
    She is one of the weaker characters right now, I guess. On the positive side, they might buff her after this. :)
    Many people used her, just didn’t get to top 50, that’s why this list is meh
I call bullshit, I watched both days so far and this is skewed, why not list all characters chosen?  There were multiple Leo’s. A yoshimitsu, a metric fuckton of King players, a much larger size of eddy, Azu and Drag, multiple Zafina’s, half a dozen xiayous, let’s talk about the elephant in the room.  There were FOUR characters simply never chosen.  They are : Panda, Paul, Devil Jin and Kazuya.
    These are the players who made it into the top 50. I don't know anything about the general pick rate of characters across the entire tournament.
Paul is top 3 and no one played him wow....
    Paul is not top 3 lol or close, I’ll assume this is a joke.
        Paul is not top 3 but he is very underrated. Him, law and lili are top-tier characters that nobody really talks about that much.
            Idk about all the chief. I’d put him below both of the others. What do you think makes him top?
                He has all of the tools you need in T8. And his damage is absurd. He kills in two touches which is super important in my opinion.
            Law and Lili are both really strong characters rn tho. Paul kinda normal.
                Nah people be sleeping on him. He does so much damage and has so many nasty setups. Just nobody plays him. Bummer the pakistani paul couldnt come to evo he wouldve bodied people left and right.
    Top 3?! What a take
Double and Mangja's matches being back-to-back on stream was crazy. Just destroying everyone in losers.
Two of the best Laws in the world too.
They're both losers.
    They're part of the top 6 but in the loser bracket. They fight the one who loses at the winners bracket. If they can win they can still be the champion.
        Was a cringy ha-haa joke with the double meaning, but the law players took it personal heh
            Nah, it just wasn’t funny.
                Now I took it personal
Yes yes!!
3:30PM JST time on monday.

Every match I saw, he was playing Eddy.
    Ah damn I was looking forward to watching his Lars he used to main Lars literally just before this
        Watch one of his eddy matches and you can see why he's using him for tournament.
            man he had some fun matches, I'm amazed he pushed chanel to a final game as well as beat yagami who was playing really well this tourney
Is this the same Tekken master as the one who's a pro in mortal Kombat?
    Yes
    Yup
AK lost to Knee and Double, Knee lost to Chikurin and Yagami
    dang i gotta find that ak versus double match
    Am I so dense Evo Japan was last night and I missed it?
        Sort of Day 1 was Saturday morning til Night, Sunday was 10am to \~4pm with a lunch break (JST time), but day 1 was only barely streamed and like half of losers in day 2 were completely off-stream.

Tomorrow is top 6.
            ah okay, perfect. thanks.
Knee lost before top 8 to Chikurin and I forgot who the other person was.
    he lost to yagami which was a aussie reina player unfortunately most if not all of his matches were off stream and he got eddy gordo’d by tekken master
Knee was beaten 2-0 by Lili player (chikurin)
They did. Got eliminated in the pools
JDCR lost to Lowhigh on stream, then got eliminated by Saint offstream.

  
Ulsan lost to Mulgold then Yagami
    Yagami is an Australian player and had a crazy run. Knocked out Knee, Ulsan, and Pinya before finally falling to Tekken Master
Uslan was T17 and JDCR was T25.
JDCR hasn't been at the top of the mountain for a while now, no surprises with this top 6 tbh
    JDCR was a top performer in all of the korean tournaments so far, what are you talking about? He just won the last ATL lol
        Fair enough
I think KNEE switched to Drag and was eliminated by Chikurin.
    Chikurin sent him to loser, he was later eliminated offstream by Yagami. There was a cam stream of it, he was playing Feng against Yagami's Reina.
        Ah gotcha. 

Missed that part. This tournament is NOT kind to EU viewers.
        [deleted]
            it's not just "some lili," it's chikurin. lmfao.
                Juhdicur moment
            Chikurin's not just some random b-level player that caught Knee unawares -- he also knocked Knee into the loser's bracket en route to winning the Tekken World Tour Finals in 2019.

It would, actually. Cunt. No sarcasm in mine.
Eyemusician can't compete until later this year due to mandatory military service.
I wish eyemusician was there his yoshi is really fun to watch he would’ve definitely made top 50 too
    Eyemusician would have IYOOOOOOOO so hard in this EVO.
Chikurin and Yagami.
It is not that people forgot, they see tier lists and/or their own experiences and think that it applies to everything. I had a friend who claimed that Drag vs Azu was going to be in Evo Japan too and that Alisa and Yoshi were both broken
Ye he lost against meo-ils victor I believe but he did hit a taunt jet upper 😂🤷🏻
    I didnt even know jimmy played, just seeing his name pop up was hype for me. His bryan made so many good reads but Victor just 5050d him to death
You have footage of his matches for a friend? He keeps bugging me for his matches.
    Someone already uploaded some of Jimmys matches to YouTube. Not all with who exactly he is playing with but every match so far he had was entertaining AF
        Link? So my friend can shut up?
            https://youtu.be/EvG31Fb0U0U?si=Bf-m-QlcPcSjMF9H

Some more should appear in recommended after this link
                Tyvm. He has been asking me for almost a week for Jimmy and I told him over and over again I will do it when I see him lol.
Nina has been put by pros in s tier since the start. Alissa and lili have been A tier on those same lists. It's just this sub that struggles with remembering things.
    Alisa and Lili are definitely S tier. There’s a few characters from everyone’s list that are overstated that don’t belong in S. Kuma is not bottom tier also. The early tier lists are way off and was just a couple of guys following each other’s personal opinion.
        I wouldn't put those 2 in s yet. They aren't quite as good as feng, drag, Nina, etc.
            Lili is almost purpose-built for tournament level play. Strong tracking, strong movement (in fact, she's the only character in the game who can step out of certain setups), great mid-pokes and lows, a solid-50/50 game, and zero execution requirements so you can't fuck any of it up under pressure.
                Yeah she's a good tournament character, but still  not s tier. I feel like she's not oppressive enough to be s tier.
                    I dunno man. There might be a case for it. I can't actually think of any weaknesses she has in T8.

Historically, it was her tracking, but her tracking is extremely good in T8. She also has top-tier mix.

I personally think she's better than at least 2 of the commonly cited S-tiers in tournament play.
                        Yeah probably. Imo the only definitive s tier so far are feng (he just has everything, perfect character), drag (mostly because of his dmg) and Nina. And i feel like she isn't as good as they are. Compared to king, azu, etc tho? Yeah sure, she belongs with those.
                            My hot take is that Feng is the best character in the game, followed closely by Drag and Nina. 

Ling, King, and Jun are overrated and won't hang in the top tiers long term (especially if Namco nerfs a few key moves).

Lili, Alisa, Law, and Claudio are all underrated.
            Alisa’s chip damage is oppressive and her evasion is good along with ranged 5050s she’s definitely up there. Nina’s NCC d4,3,4 is something else along with her armor heat engager that’s helping. I’d kick Ling out of S. Don’t think she belongs there and place these 2 in it.
                Ling yeah, i don't think alissa's quite s tier tho
                    I played a GoD Alisa yesterday. Never has she been so oppressive in any other Tekkens and been fighting a lot of decent Alisas since T6 arcade days. It's all guessing game. Some heat chain saws setups you can do nothing but block and take the chip since she's so plus on block . She has plenty of 5050 options if you guess wrong its over. I feel she's 100% S tier.
                        Yeah maybe i guess. She's very good for sure.
    I have been saying this for ages that Nina, Alisa, and Lili are good but nobody listens to me so I stopped bothering.
Lili is legit a problem, super slept on.
    not at all ? She's always in A tier in tier list, she has very strong combos and good 50/50. She's clearly not "slept on".
    Since the matchmaking change I’ve been playing nothing but lilies, like nonstop. She’s super good.
I BEEN SAYING LILI IS A WALKING NUCLEAR BOMB
Every waifu is a problem but Asuka and zafina, anybody noticed that?
Jeondding did it, here is the iphone stream of that match: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ8tg\_zuTvE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ8tg_zuTvE)
    And he did so well against rangchu fucckkkkk
    I gotta find more of these streams. There weren’t enough official ones!!
To the surprise of absolutely nobody
no way
Yup. Reddit and Twitter Tekken players are exaggerating balance issues. What they are experiencing does not represent absolute reality. If you look at other tournaments, there is a greater diversity of characters than in Tekken 7.

Numan recently won with Steve in a tough Pakistani tournament. Kuma has won various tournaments, etc.
Bro the dumb fucks in this subreddit just parrot the ramblings of whatever streamer they consider to be their god. They have 0 ability to think independently or critically.

I guarantee you, the nanosecond some of these streamers look at the data and change their opinion, this sub will follow. We can’t expect these people to critically evaluate the data—we have to wait for their gods to tell them what to think.
Somebody was right: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Tekken/comments/1bjmplb/comment/kvtkaed/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tekken/comments/1bjmplb/comment/kvtkaed/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
Based on a single tournament? That's certainly a take.
    Multiple tourneys have had character variety like this. This is just the first big international one.
        Not really. The most competitive tournaments so far are the korean ATL ones which had drag and azucena as most picked characters.

That aside, character variety needs context, it makes no statement about the balancing of characters. Of course the eddy main is going to pick eddy again, of course the law main is going to pick law and so on. The vast majority of players stick to their main unless one character is so much better than everyone else that you cant compete.

Also his take doesnt reference character variety but balancing. This sub and every pro under the sun kept saying azucena and drag are too good. It's such a classic reddit take to say that this has been invalidated because of one tournament. Even if there were no drags in the top 32 this take would still be nonsensical and a fallacy.
            Pakistan is a competitive scene. In the recent offline tournament, their top 8 have variety.  It's won by Steve player. ATL also has been won before by CBM Jin. Lowhigh and Knee have not won ATL despite using Dragunov .There are many tournaments without Dragunov in the top 8 and Dragunov is not dominating tournaments. As I mentioned a balancing issue is exaggerated by online Reddit warriors like you..


Sub is absolutely wrong as they are expecting many Dragunovs and Azucenas in the top 8.
                This comment is the perfect example of what I am talking about. You're making balancing assumptions based on nonsensical things and without context.

The reason why in pakistan drag doesnt win every tournament is because the best pakistan players do not play dragunov.

>Lowhigh and Knee have not won ATL despite using Dragunov

JDCR won ATL with dragunov and ATL had drags in every single top 8. Once again this is one of those fallacies where ONE player ONCE didnt do well and therefor his character is actually not that strong? What are those leaps in logic?

Also knee is obviously out of the race. Doesnt matter if he plays drag, lili or feng, he is not good at T8 yet compared to the other top koreans. 

>There are many tournaments without Dragunov in the top 8 

Again, when a tournament takes place and 0 good dragunov players attend you cant use that as a fact against dragunov not being good. A 7 year old would understand this. We have a drag in top 8 all the time in ATL because there actually are dragunov players in korea. Now in evo japan we have 4 drags in top 50 which is already an overrepresentation of a character as there are 33 and one of them is in top 8. Also one of the drags happened to put another top drag into losers, we mightve ended up with 2 drags in top 8 otherwise.

Also wasnt the electric clash final we just had drag vs azucena in the finals? lol.

>Sub is absolutely wrong as they are expecting many Dragunovs and Azucenas in the top 8.

Without knowing who will attend evo japan sub was 100% correct to assume a lot of drags and azucenas will do well. Pakistan not getting their visas as arslan wouldve likely competet with azucena and jondding switching from azucena to eddy despite suggesting that he probably wont already eliminates some placements.

If anyone wouldve told you arslan ash, ulsan, JDCR, lowhigh and jondding would make it top 8, you wouldve unironically said that seems improbable?
                    Tournament results are context data and sensical. You are grasping for straw. You are just being stupid.

Not only one player, Knee and Lowhigh played Dragunov but did not win ATL. JDCR finally won ATL after 5 ATL. As I said Dragunov is not even dominating Tekken 8 tournaments 

The fact is Dragunov is not dominating tournaments. Yup this sub is wrong. Many here predicted multiple Dragunov in the top 8 in Evo Japan.

You are salivating on 4 Dragunov in top 5. So from top 8 you stretched it top 50  to sound you have an argument.You are looking silly again. 4 Dragunov in top 50 is not over representation. Of course you expect Dragunov players like Nobi and JDCR  to at least make top 50. Don't be so stupid.

Multiple tournaments have a variety in the top 8. You are just again stupid. 

Correction no Dragunov won a tournament in Pakistan.
                        >Tournament results are context data. You are grasping for straw

No, thats what you are doing. You're going: oh this one guy plays dragunov only got to the finals twice and only one one of the tournaments out of fucking 64 of the literal best players on earth, therefor the character he plays must not be that good. Thats you. Youre saying this.
                            Nope. You are just stupid. What I said plenty of times overall Dragunov is not dominating tournaments. That's facts and data.Tournament results are context data and sensical. You are grasping for straw. 

You are salivating on 4 Dragunov in the top 5. So from top 8 you stretched it top 50  to sound you have an argument.You are looking silly again. 4 Dragunov in the top 50 is not over representation. Of course you expect Dragunov players like Nobi and JDCR  to at least make the top 50. Don't be so stupid.


MANY IN THIS SUB MENTIONED THAT there will be many Dragunovs and Azucenas in the top 8 at Evo Japan. They are WRONG.
Except the top comment here proved that it wasn't. In top 50, 72% of players played the same 7 characters.
Why would you be happy about this? There's nothing fun in playing a character that's considered strong
Aww cmon, don’t sleep on Chanel.  And this game really fits his playstyle
He was, but recently Korean fans have started to notice that his form suddenly went up.

&nbsp;

Probably because he finally found the character (Nina) that suits him the most.
That is how it be.
He and other Pakistani players couldn't make it due to visa issues.
    Oh that is unfortunate. Thank you
    Its always the visa smh arslan did say getting a visa was harder than fighting at evo
    AGAIN???
        Yes, but this time it seems to be because the embassy moved making it harder to get the situation handled.
If this was traditional sports, they wouldn't have had those VISA problems we see all the time in Esport :/
I was looking out for Mr. Croft and Yordez. Croft did better with T7 Xiaoyu and surprised Yordez finished so low since he probably the best Ling in the world. Wecka scraped by a King I’m not familiar with to get top 17. But yeah Ling is decent but she’s not S tier that everyone is complaining about. Probably just shy outside the top 10.
    You and I should both watch more YUYU, she did super well
        She has always been solid.
I love how all of the dumbos now crawl out of their holes with their disingenious told-you-sos. When none of the good players play xiaoyu because they dont like her that does not mean she isnt good.
    She’s not S tier for sure. She’s more of the middle of the pack. Arslan gave up on her for a reason. There were some Ling players that had strong showings with her in T7 that placed lower here. The guy that beat knee and Arslan a few times finished 33. Outside of heat, she still has major problems with reach and pressure and can still be turtled to death by defensive players.
        She is S-tier for sure. Arslan did not give up on her lmao, he never intended to play her. There simply isn't a top-tier ling player right now. That's all there is to it. 

>The guy that beat knee 

And knee didnt even finish top 50, whats your point?
            Such cognitive dissonance.
I watched a video that analyzed King, and Lil Majin was reacting to it, and it said that King is only really good at lower levels. Lil Majin was agreeing with it btw.
Moreso a lot of playstyle change tbh.

A lot of high level players having a habit of just trying to fish for throws or just not using any other throws other than the 2 signatures (GS and SW). Both of these playstyle are wrong in a way.

If you only fish for throws, eventually you are gonna be duck launched and got beat very quickly. This is mostly noob level mistake and would then let to the other wrong playstyle due to overcorrection.

The overcorrection is to only use GS and iSW for offense and mix-up, while completely forgot King's crouch throws and other easier imput throw (like Muscle Buster) and opted for mostly shove and strike to counterhit. This throws out the real reason why King is strong: counter throw. Throw now tracks, counter throws now having nearly unbreakable break window and actually are unbreakable if you punish/counter powercrush (including heat burst and rage art) and crouch throws are now truly unbreakable still with the 12f start-up. So you actually want to play more defensive at the start and constant counterhit the opponent with your 3 fast throws (GS and SW are 10f, MB is 11) so that they will have to choose to use lows to beat you, which allows you to use crouch throws to catch them doing it. After that, when they start to play defensive, NOW you are using your strikes to engage and forcing them into stand blocking with your mid barrage, and then throw them when you have got them conditioned.

That type of gameplay sounds more like Tekken 7, but that's the point.
JDCR was taken out in pools by lowhigh and someone else. Father unfortunately didn't participate because "his Tekken 8 isn't very good"
    Ah thanks. Father sounds humble
Sent to losers by PINYA, elim by SAINT
they couldn't go due to visa issues
VIsa issues, they didn't attend
I mean Drag's objectively top 3, I don't think the fact that Akuma was played by like 2 guys in Worlds back in T7 changed that he was top 1 by a large margin. Neither does EVO japan make Drag not a top 3 character, all it shows is that player skill matters more than the character unlike T7 S3 Leroy.

I mean there were moments in the Knee vs Chikurin set where Knee clearly did not know the proper combo conversion after getting certain CH or off-axis launches.
    Exactly, player skill matters so much more than the character and the Evo top 8 has proven it. 

If you were to look at this sub over the past month, you’d have thought the top 8 would be nothing but Drag and Azucena.

Nice to see the pro players destroy the Reddit scrub narrative. 
        Azu got a nerf to her objectively strongest move, that kind of killed the momentum for her. I don't think it's a scrub narrative to say drag is objectively very strong. Even the pro's are saying it.

EDIT - Added the words kind of
            I don’t think that’s what op is saying. Yeah drag is strong but he’s really not as bad as this sub is chirping about.
                He is as bad as this sub is claiming him to be. Pros say he is OP but he is even stronger on our level, in regular ranked play he is simply the best character in the game.
                    So why is there 1 in top 8? He’s a very easy character to pick up, if he was objectively that good pros would be playing him heavy.

Obviously this is one tournament but it begs the question. He honestly might be the best character but it’s clear that it’s not that insurmountable as people are making it out to be.
                        >So why is there 1 in top 8? He’s a very easy character to pick up, if he was objectively that good pros would be playing him heavy.

Do I really have to answer this? Like is this a serious question? Okay ill try and not be toxic here, but I hate super dishonest takes like this. You're just pretending that the player doesn't matter, nobody - and I stress again NOBODY - said that drag is an autowin. On planet earth. It just helps, that's all. The vast majority of players still pick their fighter based on who they like playing, not everyone immediately jumps to top-tier to invalidate the work they put in into their main for 20 years.

>He honestly might be the best character but it’s clear that it’s not that insurmountable as people are making it out to be.

Again, nobody on planet earth and possibly the entire universe said this. Everyone is in agreement, pros and bads alike, that drag is a tad too strong and a top 3 character. That's it. You are making up a narrative that you can then do a "gotcha" against or something. Nobody said drag is like leeroy. Nobody.
                            Did…you forget the whole original comment? We were talking about the primarily online takes of people in this sub talking about drag’s power level. I’m not making up a narrative it’s literally what we’re discussing in this thread.
                                >The fact that there is only one Drag in finals and only four in top fifty is hysterical. 
Everyone with a bit of skill already knew how linear and predictable he was and the pro players just proved it. 
Will the hive mind complainers on this sub pivot towards Law now?

You mean this terrible take? 

>I’m not making up a narrative it’s literally what we’re discussing in this thread.

No, nobody said this. Not in this thread either.
        >Exactly, player skill matters so much more than the character and the Evo top 8 has proven it. 

No, evo top 8 has not proven anything, not just because its just one tournament, we also already knew that player skill matters more?! Like we needed proof for that lmao. Nobody said player skill isnt the most important factor, otherwise we wouldve seen randos in the top 64.

>If you were to look at this sub over the past month, you’d have thought the top 8 would be nothing but Drag and Azucena.

Not just did some of the drags play each other, the two best azucena players either couldnt join the tournament or they swapped characters. The way the tournament went we couldve easily have had 4 out of top 6 be either of the two characters. It just ended up not happening which is really not a statement about how good those characters are. 

>Nice to see the pro players destroy the Reddit scrub narrative. 

It's not a reddit narrative, its the pro players that kept saying drag and azucena are OP.
Brother the same people complaining about dragunov were also the people thinking that Victor will be a top pick at EVO. People just refused to lab him in the first months but now everyone's got Dragunov figured out, even in low ranked.

JDCR being T25 with his Drag is concerning, though apparently he lost to LowHigh and from what I've seen JD has a hard time in mirror matches against him.
    >Brother the same people complaining about dragunov were also the people thinking that Victor will be a top pick at EVO. 

Uhm...who is going to tell him lol

>JDCR being T25 with his Drag is concerning

How is this concerning, he literally just lost to another dragunov.
No, they will just keep whining about Feng


If Feng not actually being played online didn't stop them, not being played on tournaments wouldn't either
    Not the Feng downplay bro
        Hearing that from a King is exceedingly ironic
            [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tekken/s/lA1orH6ckH)
I think Double and Mangja were just really on point. A lot of good reads on defense and good placements of df2 and slide mixups. Nothing really insane character wise.
    I personally think they should have never removed the DSS cancel, now the character has access to insane pressure and brutal frames for free, in prior games you had to just-frame that shit (ws4 dss for example).
        ws4 dss feels fucking insane in T8 lol
        WS4 DSS wasn't a just frame, except for 3+4,4. You did have to be on point in execution not to be beaten out by jabs though where now it's easy to save the frames.

  
What really made it stronger now is that you can just press df to instantly go into crouch slide in previous games that was really tight because you had to cancel the stance first then immediately do the motions for crouchslide.
I think he's suffering from Feng syndrome. This is the ugliest version of Law ever. Veiny, ugly, annoying, loud. 
So is Devil Jin just based on your own hatred for the character? Because there was not a single DJ in the top 100. 
    I don’t hate DJ at all. He objectively has all the right tools and more to be a contender for top 5.
        Yet he is not. He did not even make it to the top 50 and the last tournament I watched, lost early on. Lee/Jun/Asuka/Zafina/Alisa went further.
>Drag Devil Jin Feng Nina Lee

Lmao not a single DJ in top 100 and the red ranks are still crying. Truly something else.
    I’m not red rank homie, or crying, this is just my feeling on the character.

Edit: to expand upon it here’s why I (just me mind you) think that.

-excellent movement
-very very buffed throw game in a game that throws are important
-great plus frames that go into stance.
-tracking on a lot of safe options
-great combo damage

These things plus the game that 8 is, imo make him very very strong. He can almost do no wrong in heat, if a very capable player is in their bag imo he deserves the spot.
        >I’m not red rank homie, or crying, this is just my feeling on the character.

Jesus, you can't even make to red ranks? No wonder you think this. DJ is a trash character but at your level he's probably God tier.
            Adorable.
    I don't think DJ is that good right now but tournament results are never the be all end all. During TTT2 era and parts of T7 DJ was unanimously considered top tier by everyone but he barely showed up in top 8s. Reason being, why pick a technical char when an easy one is just as strong?
        >During TTT2 era and parts of T7 DJ was unanimously considered top tier by everyone but he barely showed up in top 8s.

You really should sit down and think for a while about what you wrote here.
            What's the issue with what I wrote? An obviously strong but technical char was lacking in tournament results.
Devil Jin is the most overrated char. He's already been nerfed twice and barely top 10 at this point, not even the best Mishima and you could make an argument he's the worst of the 4. Ask any high level Mishima player and they'll tell you that Jin and Kazuya are better (Reina is up for debate).
You forgot jun
An argument can be had for eddy and victor as well
Don't do it. Unga Bunga play style is too much fun
Drag and Feng aren't overpowered, they're just very strong. It's just this sub that would make you think otherwise as people substitute their lack of character knowledge with complaints about severe balance issues. Anyone who said that the top 5 characters in this game are anything close to T7's Leroy at launch are too shit at this game to know what they're talking about.
According to these stats its a lot of drags and fengs tho?
Yeah man if only the best players in the world used skill 😤
Taken aside that na and eu have NEVER been on the same level as korea in history of tekken, this tournament is evo japan. 90% of the competitors are japanese and korean. Most of the best european players didnt go, in fact some of them played in a completely different tournament that happened at the same time.
    copium na and eu are just bad
Pakistanis are the ones who kill the Koreans in pools so without them it's over
    Chikurin last hope
        I hope Double wins
It's evo, winning with anyone is impressive.
What’s impressive is you say this, but wouldn’t last a second in a match with him, no matter the character 😂
ft2 format just like online ranked lol 

it's anyone's game at that point

a few right/wrong 50/50's and it's over
    Damn, maybe you should have gone and compete there, you would have a 50-50 chance of winning.
        You always have a 50/50 chance of winning though

You either win or lose
            Just like the lottery.
                See, you win or lose (but usually lose)
            You can also draw albiet unlikely so its 33.333333333...%
                See you got a 33 1/3 chance of winning, but I, I got a 66 and 2/3 chance of winning, because Kurt Angle KNOWS he can't beat me and he's not even gonna try!
                    The numbers spell Disaster!
                But you actually have a 50/50 chance of drawing though. You either draw or dont draw.
    That’s literally fighting games and has been since the jump. You capitalize on your options and make risky moves to get an edge.

It’s always been like this, if it was anyone’s game you wouldn’t have dominant top players lol.
    It’s always ft2.. ? Even when it was Leroy’s top 8
    Have you ever seen a tournament before?  It’s always best of 3.  These are all top level pros.
        Criticize something for being badly designed/implemented

"It has always been like this" 

FGC is so used to consuming feces fed to them that they defend it by saying they have always been fed feces
            What are you yapping about?  Literally in every major fighting game tournament, you have to win a total of 6 rounds.  Whether that’s winning 2 matches with 3 rounds each, or winning 3 matches with 2 rounds each.  

With hundreds to a thousand of entrants, you think there is time for everyone to run a first to ten?  Being able to adapt quickly is a key skill in high level play.
                You're again defending the thing by saying it has always been like this

Each round is 60seconds max btw

It's not about being able to adapt quickly it's about being able to award the best player the win, a 6 round game especially in Tekken 8 with many 5050 forced moments does not do that very well
                    No, dumb dumb.  I’m defending it because it’s logical, and only a freakin moron would suggest otherwise 😂
                        > Literally in every major fighting game tournament, you have to win a total of 6 rounds.

You don't even know what you said
BUT DEN3 IS SO BROKEN, RIGHT? NERF LARS, APE CHAR ASDSDFSGSGDH
    Clearly all our moves look the same and we should be reverted to our Tekken 7 state, smh... if you disagree you are not a true and honest player like me (I spend 500 hours in practice mode doing electrics)
        Hear you loud and clear. SEN1 is now -10 on block again.
            Should be -15 minimum
You can see the names in the link. :)
Gotta be pinya right?
    Tissuemon was in the tournament also
        Didn’t know that. It was still definitely pinya though lol
            Pinya played Victor surprisingly.


The Raven who made top25 is Bobby. An up and coming player from Australia
Because people don’t like fengs design. Drag is cooler and higher tier in most peoples mind
    He's got one of my favourite designs in the game lol. Favourite male character with Leroy, Dragunov, and Raven.
        Yeah chinese kenpo master is cool but for the most part Dragu is cooler for more people
    Literally. He's too ugly for his own good. 
Chu mean unpopular online. Make it to high ranks and you see feng every match cause too many players are pathetic tier whores
I do face feng pretty often in ranked. Feng, jin and king gotta be the top 3 in my matches
I am trying to put feng in my pocket collection, but I find him syrupy and hard to combo with.
    Really? I play 7 characters and Feng has the easiest combos in my opinion of all of them. Very basic inputs, no timing issues, most of them follow similar paths.

These might not be optimal, but they're plenty of dmg and very easy. I put the tornado, ender in italics so you can see how they're all basically the same thing just with different filler. All of these do at minimum 63 dmg, while some of them are in the high 70s.

#starter 1: (basic uf4 combo)

* uf4
* f3,4
* ws3

start > 3,3 > *df4,2,1+2 T! > uf3 > 3,1+2*

#starter 2: (you can do a more damaging f3,2 with these for filler)

* c.dash 1 CH
* c.dash 2
* STC 1

starter > f3,2 > *df4,2,1+2 T! > uf3 > 3,1+2*

#starter 3: (these are your early tornado combos if you do tornado right away)

* df3
* ss4
* db4
* BKP 3
* ws2 CH 
* low parry

start T! > (dash forward) uf3 > b3 > 1 > db1,2,4

Those should be enough to get you started, if you want to see my full cheat sheet I have it in my Feng tab [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a0K2BqRMwmQLfQKSQHjF8MjJJozWiJZ_GYmoxaJsejM/edit#gid=247170507)
The entire top 51-100 consists of nothing but Devil Jin!
NP! I'm the type of weirdo who enjoys it.
Leo is heavily slept on also. I’m sure a migration will happen eventually. Definitely a top 10 character.
    I agree. I heard he's being played a lot in the higher ranks tho.
You gotta figure that on the sub we have maybe a few hundred players who are high rank and the vast majority is anywhere between green and purple. Those ranks are very flow chart heavy and a lot of players will fall for stuff that a high rank player won't. Leading to alot of crying for nerf posts when all the high rank people know that they're just whining cause they got beat. People think they're better than they are and will blame just about anything else before they ever blame themselves
>Nina is underrated as hell here. She's easily top 5, maybe even top 3. This sub seem to either forget about her or downplay her cause she's got a low playrate, but she's an insane character rn.

Which is really funny. There was a slew of tier lists being upload on YouTube like a month ago by high rank players and they all put her in S-Tier. Like the information is right there. If people don't want to listen it's their own fault.
I absolutely agree with you about Nina. She's a hidden top tier that people forget about. You know who else used to be that? Julia. She was always a hidden top tier that people didn't notice because she's "boring". Then T7 made her dlc and THAT brought eyes to her.
If you listen to Spag's heatcast episode from a couple of weeks ago, all the Koreans were picking out Nina as top 5. The perception of Nina being strong is not at all new to the Asian scene.

Claudio has also been brought up several times as potentially very strong.
    Yeah it's just this subreddit. I've heard people say claudio is bottom tier here. But i guess they also said kazuya was one of the worst characters in the game when in reality he's doing fine rn.
        Yeah this sub has a bad habit of thinking low pickrate = bad character. The amount of people I see say Shaheen and Claudio are bad is baffling.
            So, what exactly makes Claudio good? I’ve only got a few hours of playtime with him, and I honestly couldn’t figure out what might make him particularly strong in this game. I’ve got even less playtime with Shaheen, but I can understand why he’s good. Ironically enough, Claudio has my highest win rate, but I feel like that was almost purely on knowledge checks.
                He's got very good fundamental stuff. He's got the best hopkick in the game as an exemple. He's got good movement, he's got decent keepaway, he has good frames, etc.
        The idea of Claudio being bottom tier is crazy. He's preserved pretty much everything he had from T7 (where he was top 10 at the end of the game's lifespan) and his heat is completely bonkers.
            Wouldn't say he's completely preserved. Most of his CH launchers no longer ch launch like B33, F3, UF3 and 4. They also removed ff1+2 which was a really strong addition. UF 3+4 doesn't pick up consistently anymore. B1 and F3 doesn't screw mid-air opponents anymore.

His new DP move is absolutely ridiculous though.
                That isn't really any different to what other characters lost - including several of the ostensible top tiers. Most characters had several CH launchers stripped out and lost mid-air screws. He's still fundamentally intact and kept his best moves, including b1 and SS4.

I also think his heat is among the best in the game. Spammable starburst and a low (only -14 ob) heat smash combine to make him incredibly scary in heat.
                blue moon?
Not only on this subreddit. People in one Tekken stream really said that Reina and Alisa were top ten and that Claudio and Nina were an honest low tier character like lol.
Reina being underrepresented in top 50 might be due to the same reasons she loses a lot in ranked: She is so common people know the matchup.
    Reina has a lot of things that make her very much competitively unfavorable:

Trash lows
Very few plus frames
Very high execution requirement
Unfavorable 50/50s

Her presence at  Evo isn't due to people knowing the matchup. We're talking about the best players in the world here. Everybody knows pretty much every matchup. It's because people know Reina isn't really tournament viable.
    It may be, i think she's just a heihachi 2.0 tho. She's not gonna be tournament viable after a while. Maybe a bit more than heihachi, but when you look at the character's frame and techs... Other mishimas just do more than she does if we consider that both players are insanely good. 

Ff2 on block is a losing situation for reina, her 50/50 mixup game doesn't lead to combos, heavens wrath is only good at the wall...
        How is ff2 on block a losing situation?
            Because you can either be very minus or go into sentai mixup.

From sentai mixup if ff2 got blocked your opponent can make it a 50/50 by defending with duck/powercrush. Reina's hardest hiting option from sentai hits for i believe 40, if you duck or block a sentai move that's vulnerable to it you're getting a full combo. So it's disadvantageous because overall it will lead to more dmg for you than for reina. 

On top of that, you can just jab which trades with sentai 3 and beats everything else (maybe not the low option tho) if you don't want to take any risk. And again on top of that you can backdash which beats most of the options with the exception of i believe sentai 3+4 (the low) sentai 4 (flip kick) and sentai 1+3 (grab), but both sentai 4 and sentai 1+3 are reactable so doing that you can pretty much only get hit by the low. This doesn't work on every character but i'm pretty sure it works on most of them. 

She has options to deal with everything tho, like sentai into nothing if she expects a powercrush. But the deepness of the mindgames involve isn't viable. Like, what's the point of doing 10 feint in a row if at worst your opponent can chose to jab and the worst thing that can happen to him is he gets hit by a ~20 dmg low?
Not surprising, she is very weak rn, but also not really unpopular so she cant get away with people not being familiar with the matchup.
    I thought her parried would be easy noob killers. But everyone just spams power crushes in my noob bracket :'(
        The parries doing grey damage just ruins the risk reward IMO. So many times I finally get my opponents timing, land the parry followed up with a full combo, only for them to regain almost all that health if I make a mistake. Hopefully she gets some buffs real soon.
She is one of the weaker characters right now, I guess. On the positive side, they might buff her after this. :)
Many people used her, just didn’t get to top 50, that’s why this list is meh
These are the players who made it into the top 50. I don't know anything about the general pick rate of characters across the entire tournament.
Paul is not top 3 lol or close, I’ll assume this is a joke.
    Paul is not top 3 but he is very underrated. Him, law and lili are top-tier characters that nobody really talks about that much.
        Idk about all the chief. I’d put him below both of the others. What do you think makes him top?
            He has all of the tools you need in T8. And his damage is absurd. He kills in two touches which is super important in my opinion.
        Law and Lili are both really strong characters rn tho. Paul kinda normal.
            Nah people be sleeping on him. He does so much damage and has so many nasty setups. Just nobody plays him. Bummer the pakistani paul couldnt come to evo he wouldve bodied people left and right.
Top 3?! What a take
They're part of the top 6 but in the loser bracket. They fight the one who loses at the winners bracket. If they can win they can still be the champion.
    Was a cringy ha-haa joke with the double meaning, but the law players took it personal heh
        Nah, it just wasn’t funny.
            Now I took it personal
Ah damn I was looking forward to watching his Lars he used to main Lars literally just before this
    Watch one of his eddy matches and you can see why he's using him for tournament.
        man he had some fun matches, I'm amazed he pushed chanel to a final game as well as beat yagami who was playing really well this tourney
Yes
Yup
dang i gotta find that ak versus double match
Am I so dense Evo Japan was last night and I missed it?
    Sort of Day 1 was Saturday morning til Night, Sunday was 10am to \~4pm with a lunch break (JST time), but day 1 was only barely streamed and like half of losers in day 2 were completely off-stream.

Tomorrow is top 6.
        ah okay, perfect. thanks.
he lost to yagami which was a aussie reina player unfortunately most if not all of his matches were off stream and he got eddy gordo’d by tekken master
Yagami is an Australian player and had a crazy run. Knocked out Knee, Ulsan, and Pinya before finally falling to Tekken Master
JDCR was a top performer in all of the korean tournaments so far, what are you talking about? He just won the last ATL lol
    Fair enough
Chikurin sent him to loser, he was later eliminated offstream by Yagami. There was a cam stream of it, he was playing Feng against Yagami's Reina.
    Ah gotcha. 

Missed that part. This tournament is NOT kind to EU viewers.
    [deleted]
        it's not just "some lili," it's chikurin. lmfao.
            Juhdicur moment
        Chikurin's not just some random b-level player that caught Knee unawares -- he also knocked Knee into the loser's bracket en route to winning the Tekken World Tour Finals in 2019.

It would, actually. Cunt. No sarcasm in mine.
Eyemusician would have IYOOOOOOOO so hard in this EVO.
I didnt even know jimmy played, just seeing his name pop up was hype for me. His bryan made so many good reads but Victor just 5050d him to death
Someone already uploaded some of Jimmys matches to YouTube. Not all with who exactly he is playing with but every match so far he had was entertaining AF
    Link? So my friend can shut up?
        https://youtu.be/EvG31Fb0U0U?si=Bf-m-QlcPcSjMF9H

Some more should appear in recommended after this link
            Tyvm. He has been asking me for almost a week for Jimmy and I told him over and over again I will do it when I see him lol.
Alisa and Lili are definitely S tier. There’s a few characters from everyone’s list that are overstated that don’t belong in S. Kuma is not bottom tier also. The early tier lists are way off and was just a couple of guys following each other’s personal opinion.
    I wouldn't put those 2 in s yet. They aren't quite as good as feng, drag, Nina, etc.
        Lili is almost purpose-built for tournament level play. Strong tracking, strong movement (in fact, she's the only character in the game who can step out of certain setups), great mid-pokes and lows, a solid-50/50 game, and zero execution requirements so you can't fuck any of it up under pressure.
            Yeah she's a good tournament character, but still  not s tier. I feel like she's not oppressive enough to be s tier.
                I dunno man. There might be a case for it. I can't actually think of any weaknesses she has in T8.

Historically, it was her tracking, but her tracking is extremely good in T8. She also has top-tier mix.

I personally think she's better than at least 2 of the commonly cited S-tiers in tournament play.
                    Yeah probably. Imo the only definitive s tier so far are feng (he just has everything, perfect character), drag (mostly because of his dmg) and Nina. And i feel like she isn't as good as they are. Compared to king, azu, etc tho? Yeah sure, she belongs with those.
                        My hot take is that Feng is the best character in the game, followed closely by Drag and Nina. 

Ling, King, and Jun are overrated and won't hang in the top tiers long term (especially if Namco nerfs a few key moves).

Lili, Alisa, Law, and Claudio are all underrated.
        Alisa’s chip damage is oppressive and her evasion is good along with ranged 5050s she’s definitely up there. Nina’s NCC d4,3,4 is something else along with her armor heat engager that’s helping. I’d kick Ling out of S. Don’t think she belongs there and place these 2 in it.
            Ling yeah, i don't think alissa's quite s tier tho
                I played a GoD Alisa yesterday. Never has she been so oppressive in any other Tekkens and been fighting a lot of decent Alisas since T6 arcade days. It's all guessing game. Some heat chain saws setups you can do nothing but block and take the chip since she's so plus on block . She has plenty of 5050 options if you guess wrong its over. I feel she's 100% S tier.
                    Yeah maybe i guess. She's very good for sure.
I have been saying this for ages that Nina, Alisa, and Lili are good but nobody listens to me so I stopped bothering.
not at all ? She's always in A tier in tier list, she has very strong combos and good 50/50. She's clearly not "slept on".
Since the matchmaking change I’ve been playing nothing but lilies, like nonstop. She’s super good.
And he did so well against rangchu fucckkkkk
I gotta find more of these streams. There weren’t enough official ones!!
Multiple tourneys have had character variety like this. This is just the first big international one.
    Not really. The most competitive tournaments so far are the korean ATL ones which had drag and azucena as most picked characters.

That aside, character variety needs context, it makes no statement about the balancing of characters. Of course the eddy main is going to pick eddy again, of course the law main is going to pick law and so on. The vast majority of players stick to their main unless one character is so much better than everyone else that you cant compete.

Also his take doesnt reference character variety but balancing. This sub and every pro under the sun kept saying azucena and drag are too good. It's such a classic reddit take to say that this has been invalidated because of one tournament. Even if there were no drags in the top 32 this take would still be nonsensical and a fallacy.
        Pakistan is a competitive scene. In the recent offline tournament, their top 8 have variety.  It's won by Steve player. ATL also has been won before by CBM Jin. Lowhigh and Knee have not won ATL despite using Dragunov .There are many tournaments without Dragunov in the top 8 and Dragunov is not dominating tournaments. As I mentioned a balancing issue is exaggerated by online Reddit warriors like you..


Sub is absolutely wrong as they are expecting many Dragunovs and Azucenas in the top 8.
            This comment is the perfect example of what I am talking about. You're making balancing assumptions based on nonsensical things and without context.

The reason why in pakistan drag doesnt win every tournament is because the best pakistan players do not play dragunov.

>Lowhigh and Knee have not won ATL despite using Dragunov

JDCR won ATL with dragunov and ATL had drags in every single top 8. Once again this is one of those fallacies where ONE player ONCE didnt do well and therefor his character is actually not that strong? What are those leaps in logic?

Also knee is obviously out of the race. Doesnt matter if he plays drag, lili or feng, he is not good at T8 yet compared to the other top koreans. 

>There are many tournaments without Dragunov in the top 8 

Again, when a tournament takes place and 0 good dragunov players attend you cant use that as a fact against dragunov not being good. A 7 year old would understand this. We have a drag in top 8 all the time in ATL because there actually are dragunov players in korea. Now in evo japan we have 4 drags in top 50 which is already an overrepresentation of a character as there are 33 and one of them is in top 8. Also one of the drags happened to put another top drag into losers, we mightve ended up with 2 drags in top 8 otherwise.

Also wasnt the electric clash final we just had drag vs azucena in the finals? lol.

>Sub is absolutely wrong as they are expecting many Dragunovs and Azucenas in the top 8.

Without knowing who will attend evo japan sub was 100% correct to assume a lot of drags and azucenas will do well. Pakistan not getting their visas as arslan wouldve likely competet with azucena and jondding switching from azucena to eddy despite suggesting that he probably wont already eliminates some placements.

If anyone wouldve told you arslan ash, ulsan, JDCR, lowhigh and jondding would make it top 8, you wouldve unironically said that seems improbable?
                Tournament results are context data and sensical. You are grasping for straw. You are just being stupid.

Not only one player, Knee and Lowhigh played Dragunov but did not win ATL. JDCR finally won ATL after 5 ATL. As I said Dragunov is not even dominating Tekken 8 tournaments 

The fact is Dragunov is not dominating tournaments. Yup this sub is wrong. Many here predicted multiple Dragunov in the top 8 in Evo Japan.

You are salivating on 4 Dragunov in top 5. So from top 8 you stretched it top 50  to sound you have an argument.You are looking silly again. 4 Dragunov in top 50 is not over representation. Of course you expect Dragunov players like Nobi and JDCR  to at least make top 50. Don't be so stupid.

Multiple tournaments have a variety in the top 8. You are just again stupid. 

Correction no Dragunov won a tournament in Pakistan.
                    >Tournament results are context data. You are grasping for straw

No, thats what you are doing. You're going: oh this one guy plays dragunov only got to the finals twice and only one one of the tournaments out of fucking 64 of the literal best players on earth, therefor the character he plays must not be that good. Thats you. Youre saying this.
                        Nope. You are just stupid. What I said plenty of times overall Dragunov is not dominating tournaments. That's facts and data.Tournament results are context data and sensical. You are grasping for straw. 

You are salivating on 4 Dragunov in the top 5. So from top 8 you stretched it top 50  to sound you have an argument.You are looking silly again. 4 Dragunov in the top 50 is not over representation. Of course you expect Dragunov players like Nobi and JDCR  to at least make the top 50. Don't be so stupid.


MANY IN THIS SUB MENTIONED THAT there will be many Dragunovs and Azucenas in the top 8 at Evo Japan. They are WRONG.
Oh that is unfortunate. Thank you
Its always the visa smh arslan did say getting a visa was harder than fighting at evo
AGAIN???
    Yes, but this time it seems to be because the embassy moved making it harder to get the situation handled.
You and I should both watch more YUYU, she did super well
    She has always been solid.
She’s not S tier for sure. She’s more of the middle of the pack. Arslan gave up on her for a reason. There were some Ling players that had strong showings with her in T7 that placed lower here. The guy that beat knee and Arslan a few times finished 33. Outside of heat, she still has major problems with reach and pressure and can still be turtled to death by defensive players.
    She is S-tier for sure. Arslan did not give up on her lmao, he never intended to play her. There simply isn't a top-tier ling player right now. That's all there is to it. 

>The guy that beat knee 

And knee didnt even finish top 50, whats your point?
        Such cognitive dissonance.
Ah thanks. Father sounds humble
Exactly, player skill matters so much more than the character and the Evo top 8 has proven it. 

If you were to look at this sub over the past month, you’d have thought the top 8 would be nothing but Drag and Azucena.

Nice to see the pro players destroy the Reddit scrub narrative. 
    Azu got a nerf to her objectively strongest move, that kind of killed the momentum for her. I don't think it's a scrub narrative to say drag is objectively very strong. Even the pro's are saying it.

EDIT - Added the words kind of
        I don’t think that’s what op is saying. Yeah drag is strong but he’s really not as bad as this sub is chirping about.
            He is as bad as this sub is claiming him to be. Pros say he is OP but he is even stronger on our level, in regular ranked play he is simply the best character in the game.
                So why is there 1 in top 8? He’s a very easy character to pick up, if he was objectively that good pros would be playing him heavy.

Obviously this is one tournament but it begs the question. He honestly might be the best character but it’s clear that it’s not that insurmountable as people are making it out to be.
                    >So why is there 1 in top 8? He’s a very easy character to pick up, if he was objectively that good pros would be playing him heavy.

Do I really have to answer this? Like is this a serious question? Okay ill try and not be toxic here, but I hate super dishonest takes like this. You're just pretending that the player doesn't matter, nobody - and I stress again NOBODY - said that drag is an autowin. On planet earth. It just helps, that's all. The vast majority of players still pick their fighter based on who they like playing, not everyone immediately jumps to top-tier to invalidate the work they put in into their main for 20 years.

>He honestly might be the best character but it’s clear that it’s not that insurmountable as people are making it out to be.

Again, nobody on planet earth and possibly the entire universe said this. Everyone is in agreement, pros and bads alike, that drag is a tad too strong and a top 3 character. That's it. You are making up a narrative that you can then do a "gotcha" against or something. Nobody said drag is like leeroy. Nobody.
                        Did…you forget the whole original comment? We were talking about the primarily online takes of people in this sub talking about drag’s power level. I’m not making up a narrative it’s literally what we’re discussing in this thread.
                            >The fact that there is only one Drag in finals and only four in top fifty is hysterical. 
Everyone with a bit of skill already knew how linear and predictable he was and the pro players just proved it. 
Will the hive mind complainers on this sub pivot towards Law now?

You mean this terrible take? 

>I’m not making up a narrative it’s literally what we’re discussing in this thread.

No, nobody said this. Not in this thread either.
    >Exactly, player skill matters so much more than the character and the Evo top 8 has proven it. 

No, evo top 8 has not proven anything, not just because its just one tournament, we also already knew that player skill matters more?! Like we needed proof for that lmao. Nobody said player skill isnt the most important factor, otherwise we wouldve seen randos in the top 64.

>If you were to look at this sub over the past month, you’d have thought the top 8 would be nothing but Drag and Azucena.

Not just did some of the drags play each other, the two best azucena players either couldnt join the tournament or they swapped characters. The way the tournament went we couldve easily have had 4 out of top 6 be either of the two characters. It just ended up not happening which is really not a statement about how good those characters are. 

>Nice to see the pro players destroy the Reddit scrub narrative. 

It's not a reddit narrative, its the pro players that kept saying drag and azucena are OP.
>Brother the same people complaining about dragunov were also the people thinking that Victor will be a top pick at EVO. 

Uhm...who is going to tell him lol

>JDCR being T25 with his Drag is concerning

How is this concerning, he literally just lost to another dragunov.
Not the Feng downplay bro
    Hearing that from a King is exceedingly ironic
        [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tekken/s/lA1orH6ckH)
I personally think they should have never removed the DSS cancel, now the character has access to insane pressure and brutal frames for free, in prior games you had to just-frame that shit (ws4 dss for example).
    ws4 dss feels fucking insane in T8 lol
    WS4 DSS wasn't a just frame, except for 3+4,4. You did have to be on point in execution not to be beaten out by jabs though where now it's easy to save the frames.

  
What really made it stronger now is that you can just press df to instantly go into crouch slide in previous games that was really tight because you had to cancel the stance first then immediately do the motions for crouchslide.
I don’t hate DJ at all. He objectively has all the right tools and more to be a contender for top 5.
    Yet he is not. He did not even make it to the top 50 and the last tournament I watched, lost early on. Lee/Jun/Asuka/Zafina/Alisa went further.
I’m not red rank homie, or crying, this is just my feeling on the character.

Edit: to expand upon it here’s why I (just me mind you) think that.

-excellent movement
-very very buffed throw game in a game that throws are important
-great plus frames that go into stance.
-tracking on a lot of safe options
-great combo damage

These things plus the game that 8 is, imo make him very very strong. He can almost do no wrong in heat, if a very capable player is in their bag imo he deserves the spot.
    >I’m not red rank homie, or crying, this is just my feeling on the character.

Jesus, you can't even make to red ranks? No wonder you think this. DJ is a trash character but at your level he's probably God tier.
        Adorable.
I don't think DJ is that good right now but tournament results are never the be all end all. During TTT2 era and parts of T7 DJ was unanimously considered top tier by everyone but he barely showed up in top 8s. Reason being, why pick a technical char when an easy one is just as strong?
    >During TTT2 era and parts of T7 DJ was unanimously considered top tier by everyone but he barely showed up in top 8s.

You really should sit down and think for a while about what you wrote here.
        What's the issue with what I wrote? An obviously strong but technical char was lacking in tournament results.
copium na and eu are just bad
Chikurin last hope
    I hope Double wins
Damn, maybe you should have gone and compete there, you would have a 50-50 chance of winning.
    You always have a 50/50 chance of winning though

You either win or lose
        Just like the lottery.
            See, you win or lose (but usually lose)
        You can also draw albiet unlikely so its 33.333333333...%
            See you got a 33 1/3 chance of winning, but I, I got a 66 and 2/3 chance of winning, because Kurt Angle KNOWS he can't beat me and he's not even gonna try!
                The numbers spell Disaster!
            But you actually have a 50/50 chance of drawing though. You either draw or dont draw.
That’s literally fighting games and has been since the jump. You capitalize on your options and make risky moves to get an edge.

It’s always been like this, if it was anyone’s game you wouldn’t have dominant top players lol.
It’s always ft2.. ? Even when it was Leroy’s top 8
Have you ever seen a tournament before?  It’s always best of 3.  These are all top level pros.
    Criticize something for being badly designed/implemented

"It has always been like this" 

FGC is so used to consuming feces fed to them that they defend it by saying they have always been fed feces
        What are you yapping about?  Literally in every major fighting game tournament, you have to win a total of 6 rounds.  Whether that’s winning 2 matches with 3 rounds each, or winning 3 matches with 2 rounds each.  

With hundreds to a thousand of entrants, you think there is time for everyone to run a first to ten?  Being able to adapt quickly is a key skill in high level play.
            You're again defending the thing by saying it has always been like this

Each round is 60seconds max btw

It's not about being able to adapt quickly it's about being able to award the best player the win, a 6 round game especially in Tekken 8 with many 5050 forced moments does not do that very well
                No, dumb dumb.  I’m defending it because it’s logical, and only a freakin moron would suggest otherwise 😂
                    > Literally in every major fighting game tournament, you have to win a total of 6 rounds.

You don't even know what you said
Clearly all our moves look the same and we should be reverted to our Tekken 7 state, smh... if you disagree you are not a true and honest player like me (I spend 500 hours in practice mode doing electrics)
    Hear you loud and clear. SEN1 is now -10 on block again.
        Should be -15 minimum
Tissuemon was in the tournament also
    Didn’t know that. It was still definitely pinya though lol
        Pinya played Victor surprisingly.


The Raven who made top25 is Bobby. An up and coming player from Australia
He's got one of my favourite designs in the game lol. Favourite male character with Leroy, Dragunov, and Raven.
    Yeah chinese kenpo master is cool but for the most part Dragu is cooler for more people
Literally. He's too ugly for his own good. 
Really? I play 7 characters and Feng has the easiest combos in my opinion of all of them. Very basic inputs, no timing issues, most of them follow similar paths.

These might not be optimal, but they're plenty of dmg and very easy. I put the tornado, ender in italics so you can see how they're all basically the same thing just with different filler. All of these do at minimum 63 dmg, while some of them are in the high 70s.

#starter 1: (basic uf4 combo)

* uf4
* f3,4
* ws3

start > 3,3 > *df4,2,1+2 T! > uf3 > 3,1+2*

#starter 2: (you can do a more damaging f3,2 with these for filler)

* c.dash 1 CH
* c.dash 2
* STC 1

starter > f3,2 > *df4,2,1+2 T! > uf3 > 3,1+2*

#starter 3: (these are your early tornado combos if you do tornado right away)

* df3
* ss4
* db4
* BKP 3
* ws2 CH 
* low parry

start T! > (dash forward) uf3 > b3 > 1 > db1,2,4

Those should be enough to get you started, if you want to see my full cheat sheet I have it in my Feng tab [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a0K2BqRMwmQLfQKSQHjF8MjJJozWiJZ_GYmoxaJsejM/edit#gid=247170507)
I agree. I heard he's being played a lot in the higher ranks tho.
Yeah it's just this subreddit. I've heard people say claudio is bottom tier here. But i guess they also said kazuya was one of the worst characters in the game when in reality he's doing fine rn.
    Yeah this sub has a bad habit of thinking low pickrate = bad character. The amount of people I see say Shaheen and Claudio are bad is baffling.
        So, what exactly makes Claudio good? I’ve only got a few hours of playtime with him, and I honestly couldn’t figure out what might make him particularly strong in this game. I’ve got even less playtime with Shaheen, but I can understand why he’s good. Ironically enough, Claudio has my highest win rate, but I feel like that was almost purely on knowledge checks.
            He's got very good fundamental stuff. He's got the best hopkick in the game as an exemple. He's got good movement, he's got decent keepaway, he has good frames, etc.
    The idea of Claudio being bottom tier is crazy. He's preserved pretty much everything he had from T7 (where he was top 10 at the end of the game's lifespan) and his heat is completely bonkers.
        Wouldn't say he's completely preserved. Most of his CH launchers no longer ch launch like B33, F3, UF3 and 4. They also removed ff1+2 which was a really strong addition. UF 3+4 doesn't pick up consistently anymore. B1 and F3 doesn't screw mid-air opponents anymore.

His new DP move is absolutely ridiculous though.
            That isn't really any different to what other characters lost - including several of the ostensible top tiers. Most characters had several CH launchers stripped out and lost mid-air screws. He's still fundamentally intact and kept his best moves, including b1 and SS4.

I also think his heat is among the best in the game. Spammable starburst and a low (only -14 ob) heat smash combine to make him incredibly scary in heat.
            blue moon?
Reina has a lot of things that make her very much competitively unfavorable:

Trash lows
Very few plus frames
Very high execution requirement
Unfavorable 50/50s

Her presence at  Evo isn't due to people knowing the matchup. We're talking about the best players in the world here. Everybody knows pretty much every matchup. It's because people know Reina isn't really tournament viable.
It may be, i think she's just a heihachi 2.0 tho. She's not gonna be tournament viable after a while. Maybe a bit more than heihachi, but when you look at the character's frame and techs... Other mishimas just do more than she does if we consider that both players are insanely good. 

Ff2 on block is a losing situation for reina, her 50/50 mixup game doesn't lead to combos, heavens wrath is only good at the wall...
    How is ff2 on block a losing situation?
        Because you can either be very minus or go into sentai mixup.

From sentai mixup if ff2 got blocked your opponent can make it a 50/50 by defending with duck/powercrush. Reina's hardest hiting option from sentai hits for i believe 40, if you duck or block a sentai move that's vulnerable to it you're getting a full combo. So it's disadvantageous because overall it will lead to more dmg for you than for reina. 

On top of that, you can just jab which trades with sentai 3 and beats everything else (maybe not the low option tho) if you don't want to take any risk. And again on top of that you can backdash which beats most of the options with the exception of i believe sentai 3+4 (the low) sentai 4 (flip kick) and sentai 1+3 (grab), but both sentai 4 and sentai 1+3 are reactable so doing that you can pretty much only get hit by the low. This doesn't work on every character but i'm pretty sure it works on most of them. 

She has options to deal with everything tho, like sentai into nothing if she expects a powercrush. But the deepness of the mindgames involve isn't viable. Like, what's the point of doing 10 feint in a row if at worst your opponent can chose to jab and the worst thing that can happen to him is he gets hit by a ~20 dmg low?
I thought her parried would be easy noob killers. But everyone just spams power crushes in my noob bracket :'(
    The parries doing grey damage just ruins the risk reward IMO. So many times I finally get my opponents timing, land the parry followed up with a full combo, only for them to regain almost all that health if I make a mistake. Hopefully she gets some buffs real soon.
Paul is not top 3 but he is very underrated. Him, law and lili are top-tier characters that nobody really talks about that much.
    Idk about all the chief. I’d put him below both of the others. What do you think makes him top?
        He has all of the tools you need in T8. And his damage is absurd. He kills in two touches which is super important in my opinion.
    Law and Lili are both really strong characters rn tho. Paul kinda normal.
        Nah people be sleeping on him. He does so much damage and has so many nasty setups. Just nobody plays him. Bummer the pakistani paul couldnt come to evo he wouldve bodied people left and right.
Was a cringy ha-haa joke with the double meaning, but the law players took it personal heh
    Nah, it just wasn’t funny.
        Now I took it personal
Watch one of his eddy matches and you can see why he's using him for tournament.
    man he had some fun matches, I'm amazed he pushed chanel to a final game as well as beat yagami who was playing really well this tourney
Sort of Day 1 was Saturday morning til Night, Sunday was 10am to \~4pm with a lunch break (JST time), but day 1 was only barely streamed and like half of losers in day 2 were completely off-stream.

Tomorrow is top 6.
    ah okay, perfect. thanks.
Fair enough
Ah gotcha. 

Missed that part. This tournament is NOT kind to EU viewers.

    it's not just "some lili," it's chikurin. lmfao.

    Chikurin's not just some random b-level player that caught Knee unawares -- he also knocked Knee into the loser's bracket en route to winning the Tekken World Tour Finals in 2019.

        Tyvm. He has been asking me for almost a week for Jimmy and I told him over and over again I will do it when I see him lol.
I wouldn't put those 2 in s yet. They aren't quite as good as feng, drag, Nina, etc.
    Lili is almost purpose-built for tournament level play. Strong tracking, strong movement (in fact, she's the only character in the game who can step out of certain setups), great mid-pokes and lows, a solid-50/50 game, and zero execution requirements so you can't fuck any of it up under pressure.
        Yeah she's a good tournament character, but still  not s tier. I feel like she's not oppressive enough to be s tier.
            I dunno man. There might be a case for it. I can't actually think of any weaknesses she has in T8.

Historically, it was her tracking, but her tracking is extremely good in T8. She also has top-tier mix.

I personally think she's better than at least 2 of the commonly cited S-tiers in tournament play.
                Yeah probably. Imo the only definitive s tier so far are feng (he just has everything, perfect character), drag (mostly because of his dmg) and Nina. And i feel like she isn't as good as they are. Compared to king, azu, etc tho? Yeah sure, she belongs with those.
                    My hot take is that Feng is the best character in the game, followed closely by Drag and Nina. 

Ling, King, and Jun are overrated and won't hang in the top tiers long term (especially if Namco nerfs a few key moves).

Lili, Alisa, Law, and Claudio are all underrated.
    Alisa’s chip damage is oppressive and her evasion is good along with ranged 5050s she’s definitely up there. Nina’s NCC d4,3,4 is something else along with her armor heat engager that’s helping. I’d kick Ling out of S. Don’t think she belongs there and place these 2 in it.
        Ling yeah, i don't think alissa's quite s tier tho
            I played a GoD Alisa yesterday. Never has she been so oppressive in any other Tekkens and been fighting a lot of decent Alisas since T6 arcade days. It's all guessing game. Some heat chain saws setups you can do nothing but block and take the chip since she's so plus on block . She has plenty of 5050 options if you guess wrong its over. I feel she's 100% S tier.
                Yeah maybe i guess. She's very good for sure.
Not really. The most competitive tournaments so far are the korean ATL ones which had drag and azucena as most picked characters.

That aside, character variety needs context, it makes no statement about the balancing of characters. Of course the eddy main is going to pick eddy again, of course the law main is going to pick law and so on. The vast majority of players stick to their main unless one character is so much better than everyone else that you cant compete.

Also his take doesnt reference character variety but balancing. This sub and every pro under the sun kept saying azucena and drag are too good. It's such a classic reddit take to say that this has been invalidated because of one tournament. Even if there were no drags in the top 32 this take would still be nonsensical and a fallacy.
    Pakistan is a competitive scene. In the recent offline tournament, their top 8 have variety.  It's won by Steve player. ATL also has been won before by CBM Jin. Lowhigh and Knee have not won ATL despite using Dragunov .There are many tournaments without Dragunov in the top 8 and Dragunov is not dominating tournaments. As I mentioned a balancing issue is exaggerated by online Reddit warriors like you..


Sub is absolutely wrong as they are expecting many Dragunovs and Azucenas in the top 8.
        This comment is the perfect example of what I am talking about. You're making balancing assumptions based on nonsensical things and without context.

The reason why in pakistan drag doesnt win every tournament is because the best pakistan players do not play dragunov.

>Lowhigh and Knee have not won ATL despite using Dragunov

JDCR won ATL with dragunov and ATL had drags in every single top 8. Once again this is one of those fallacies where ONE player ONCE didnt do well and therefor his character is actually not that strong? What are those leaps in logic?

Also knee is obviously out of the race. Doesnt matter if he plays drag, lili or feng, he is not good at T8 yet compared to the other top koreans. 

>There are many tournaments without Dragunov in the top 8 

Again, when a tournament takes place and 0 good dragunov players attend you cant use that as a fact against dragunov not being good. A 7 year old would understand this. We have a drag in top 8 all the time in ATL because there actually are dragunov players in korea. Now in evo japan we have 4 drags in top 50 which is already an overrepresentation of a character as there are 33 and one of them is in top 8. Also one of the drags happened to put another top drag into losers, we mightve ended up with 2 drags in top 8 otherwise.

Also wasnt the electric clash final we just had drag vs azucena in the finals? lol.

>Sub is absolutely wrong as they are expecting many Dragunovs and Azucenas in the top 8.

Without knowing who will attend evo japan sub was 100% correct to assume a lot of drags and azucenas will do well. Pakistan not getting their visas as arslan wouldve likely competet with azucena and jondding switching from azucena to eddy despite suggesting that he probably wont already eliminates some placements.

If anyone wouldve told you arslan ash, ulsan, JDCR, lowhigh and jondding would make it top 8, you wouldve unironically said that seems improbable?
            Tournament results are context data and sensical. You are grasping for straw. You are just being stupid.

Not only one player, Knee and Lowhigh played Dragunov but did not win ATL. JDCR finally won ATL after 5 ATL. As I said Dragunov is not even dominating Tekken 8 tournaments 

The fact is Dragunov is not dominating tournaments. Yup this sub is wrong. Many here predicted multiple Dragunov in the top 8 in Evo Japan.

You are salivating on 4 Dragunov in top 5. So from top 8 you stretched it top 50  to sound you have an argument.You are looking silly again. 4 Dragunov in top 50 is not over representation. Of course you expect Dragunov players like Nobi and JDCR  to at least make top 50. Don't be so stupid.

Multiple tournaments have a variety in the top 8. You are just again stupid. 

Correction no Dragunov won a tournament in Pakistan.
                >Tournament results are context data. You are grasping for straw

No, thats what you are doing. You're going: oh this one guy plays dragunov only got to the finals twice and only one one of the tournaments out of fucking 64 of the literal best players on earth, therefor the character he plays must not be that good. Thats you. Youre saying this.
                    Nope. You are just stupid. What I said plenty of times overall Dragunov is not dominating tournaments. That's facts and data.Tournament results are context data and sensical. You are grasping for straw. 

You are salivating on 4 Dragunov in the top 5. So from top 8 you stretched it top 50  to sound you have an argument.You are looking silly again. 4 Dragunov in the top 50 is not over representation. Of course you expect Dragunov players like Nobi and JDCR  to at least make the top 50. Don't be so stupid.


MANY IN THIS SUB MENTIONED THAT there will be many Dragunovs and Azucenas in the top 8 at Evo Japan. They are WRONG.
Yes, but this time it seems to be because the embassy moved making it harder to get the situation handled.
She has always been solid.
She is S-tier for sure. Arslan did not give up on her lmao, he never intended to play her. There simply isn't a top-tier ling player right now. That's all there is to it. 

>The guy that beat knee 

And knee didnt even finish top 50, whats your point?
    Such cognitive dissonance.
Azu got a nerf to her objectively strongest move, that kind of killed the momentum for her. I don't think it's a scrub narrative to say drag is objectively very strong. Even the pro's are saying it.

EDIT - Added the words kind of
    I don’t think that’s what op is saying. Yeah drag is strong but he’s really not as bad as this sub is chirping about.
        He is as bad as this sub is claiming him to be. Pros say he is OP but he is even stronger on our level, in regular ranked play he is simply the best character in the game.
            So why is there 1 in top 8? He’s a very easy character to pick up, if he was objectively that good pros would be playing him heavy.

Obviously this is one tournament but it begs the question. He honestly might be the best character but it’s clear that it’s not that insurmountable as people are making it out to be.
                >So why is there 1 in top 8? He’s a very easy character to pick up, if he was objectively that good pros would be playing him heavy.

Do I really have to answer this? Like is this a serious question? Okay ill try and not be toxic here, but I hate super dishonest takes like this. You're just pretending that the player doesn't matter, nobody - and I stress again NOBODY - said that drag is an autowin. On planet earth. It just helps, that's all. The vast majority of players still pick their fighter based on who they like playing, not everyone immediately jumps to top-tier to invalidate the work they put in into their main for 20 years.

>He honestly might be the best character but it’s clear that it’s not that insurmountable as people are making it out to be.

Again, nobody on planet earth and possibly the entire universe said this. Everyone is in agreement, pros and bads alike, that drag is a tad too strong and a top 3 character. That's it. You are making up a narrative that you can then do a "gotcha" against or something. Nobody said drag is like leeroy. Nobody.
                    Did…you forget the whole original comment? We were talking about the primarily online takes of people in this sub talking about drag’s power level. I’m not making up a narrative it’s literally what we’re discussing in this thread.
                        >The fact that there is only one Drag in finals and only four in top fifty is hysterical. 
Everyone with a bit of skill already knew how linear and predictable he was and the pro players just proved it. 
Will the hive mind complainers on this sub pivot towards Law now?

You mean this terrible take? 

>I’m not making up a narrative it’s literally what we’re discussing in this thread.

No, nobody said this. Not in this thread either.
>Exactly, player skill matters so much more than the character and the Evo top 8 has proven it. 

No, evo top 8 has not proven anything, not just because its just one tournament, we also already knew that player skill matters more?! Like we needed proof for that lmao. Nobody said player skill isnt the most important factor, otherwise we wouldve seen randos in the top 64.

>If you were to look at this sub over the past month, you’d have thought the top 8 would be nothing but Drag and Azucena.

Not just did some of the drags play each other, the two best azucena players either couldnt join the tournament or they swapped characters. The way the tournament went we couldve easily have had 4 out of top 6 be either of the two characters. It just ended up not happening which is really not a statement about how good those characters are. 

>Nice to see the pro players destroy the Reddit scrub narrative. 

It's not a reddit narrative, its the pro players that kept saying drag and azucena are OP.
Hearing that from a King is exceedingly ironic
    [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tekken/s/lA1orH6ckH)
ws4 dss feels fucking insane in T8 lol
WS4 DSS wasn't a just frame, except for 3+4,4. You did have to be on point in execution not to be beaten out by jabs though where now it's easy to save the frames.

  
What really made it stronger now is that you can just press df to instantly go into crouch slide in previous games that was really tight because you had to cancel the stance first then immediately do the motions for crouchslide.
Yet he is not. He did not even make it to the top 50 and the last tournament I watched, lost early on. Lee/Jun/Asuka/Zafina/Alisa went further.
>I’m not red rank homie, or crying, this is just my feeling on the character.

Jesus, you can't even make to red ranks? No wonder you think this. DJ is a trash character but at your level he's probably God tier.
    Adorable.
>During TTT2 era and parts of T7 DJ was unanimously considered top tier by everyone but he barely showed up in top 8s.

You really should sit down and think for a while about what you wrote here.
    What's the issue with what I wrote? An obviously strong but technical char was lacking in tournament results.
I hope Double wins
You always have a 50/50 chance of winning though

You either win or lose
    Just like the lottery.
        See, you win or lose (but usually lose)
    You can also draw albiet unlikely so its 33.333333333...%
        See you got a 33 1/3 chance of winning, but I, I got a 66 and 2/3 chance of winning, because Kurt Angle KNOWS he can't beat me and he's not even gonna try!
            The numbers spell Disaster!
        But you actually have a 50/50 chance of drawing though. You either draw or dont draw.
Criticize something for being badly designed/implemented

"It has always been like this" 

FGC is so used to consuming feces fed to them that they defend it by saying they have always been fed feces
    What are you yapping about?  Literally in every major fighting game tournament, you have to win a total of 6 rounds.  Whether that’s winning 2 matches with 3 rounds each, or winning 3 matches with 2 rounds each.  

With hundreds to a thousand of entrants, you think there is time for everyone to run a first to ten?  Being able to adapt quickly is a key skill in high level play.
        You're again defending the thing by saying it has always been like this

Each round is 60seconds max btw

It's not about being able to adapt quickly it's about being able to award the best player the win, a 6 round game especially in Tekken 8 with many 5050 forced moments does not do that very well
            No, dumb dumb.  I’m defending it because it’s logical, and only a freakin moron would suggest otherwise 😂
                > Literally in every major fighting game tournament, you have to win a total of 6 rounds.

You don't even know what you said
Hear you loud and clear. SEN1 is now -10 on block again.
    Should be -15 minimum
Didn’t know that. It was still definitely pinya though lol
    Pinya played Victor surprisingly.


The Raven who made top25 is Bobby. An up and coming player from Australia
Yeah chinese kenpo master is cool but for the most part Dragu is cooler for more people
Yeah this sub has a bad habit of thinking low pickrate = bad character. The amount of people I see say Shaheen and Claudio are bad is baffling.
    So, what exactly makes Claudio good? I’ve only got a few hours of playtime with him, and I honestly couldn’t figure out what might make him particularly strong in this game. I’ve got even less playtime with Shaheen, but I can understand why he’s good. Ironically enough, Claudio has my highest win rate, but I feel like that was almost purely on knowledge checks.
        He's got very good fundamental stuff. He's got the best hopkick in the game as an exemple. He's got good movement, he's got decent keepaway, he has good frames, etc.
The idea of Claudio being bottom tier is crazy. He's preserved pretty much everything he had from T7 (where he was top 10 at the end of the game's lifespan) and his heat is completely bonkers.
    Wouldn't say he's completely preserved. Most of his CH launchers no longer ch launch like B33, F3, UF3 and 4. They also removed ff1+2 which was a really strong addition. UF 3+4 doesn't pick up consistently anymore. B1 and F3 doesn't screw mid-air opponents anymore.

His new DP move is absolutely ridiculous though.
        That isn't really any different to what other characters lost - including several of the ostensible top tiers. Most characters had several CH launchers stripped out and lost mid-air screws. He's still fundamentally intact and kept his best moves, including b1 and SS4.

I also think his heat is among the best in the game. Spammable starburst and a low (only -14 ob) heat smash combine to make him incredibly scary in heat.
        blue moon?
How is ff2 on block a losing situation?
    Because you can either be very minus or go into sentai mixup.

From sentai mixup if ff2 got blocked your opponent can make it a 50/50 by defending with duck/powercrush. Reina's hardest hiting option from sentai hits for i believe 40, if you duck or block a sentai move that's vulnerable to it you're getting a full combo. So it's disadvantageous because overall it will lead to more dmg for you than for reina. 

On top of that, you can just jab which trades with sentai 3 and beats everything else (maybe not the low option tho) if you don't want to take any risk. And again on top of that you can backdash which beats most of the options with the exception of i believe sentai 3+4 (the low) sentai 4 (flip kick) and sentai 1+3 (grab), but both sentai 4 and sentai 1+3 are reactable so doing that you can pretty much only get hit by the low. This doesn't work on every character but i'm pretty sure it works on most of them. 

She has options to deal with everything tho, like sentai into nothing if she expects a powercrush. But the deepness of the mindgames involve isn't viable. Like, what's the point of doing 10 feint in a row if at worst your opponent can chose to jab and the worst thing that can happen to him is he gets hit by a ~20 dmg low?
The parries doing grey damage just ruins the risk reward IMO. So many times I finally get my opponents timing, land the parry followed up with a full combo, only for them to regain almost all that health if I make a mistake. Hopefully she gets some buffs real soon.
Idk about all the chief. I’d put him below both of the others. What do you think makes him top?
    He has all of the tools you need in T8. And his damage is absurd. He kills in two touches which is super important in my opinion.
Law and Lili are both really strong characters rn tho. Paul kinda normal.
    Nah people be sleeping on him. He does so much damage and has so many nasty setups. Just nobody plays him. Bummer the pakistani paul couldnt come to evo he wouldve bodied people left and right.
Nah, it just wasn’t funny.
    Now I took it personal

Pakistan is a competitive scene. In the recent offline tournament, their top 8 have variety.  It's won by Steve player. ATL also has been won before by CBM Jin. Lowhigh and Knee have not won ATL despite using Dragunov .There are many tournaments without Dragunov in the top 8 and Dragunov is not dominating tournaments. As I mentioned a balancing issue is exaggerated by online Reddit warriors like you..


Sub is absolutely wrong as they are expecting many Dragunovs and Azucenas in the top 8.
    This comment is the perfect example of what I am talking about. You're making balancing assumptions based on nonsensical things and without context.

The reason why in pakistan drag doesnt win every tournament is because the best pakistan players do not play dragunov.

>Lowhigh and Knee have not won ATL despite using Dragunov

JDCR won ATL with dragunov and ATL had drags in every single top 8. Once again this is one of those fallacies where ONE player ONCE didnt do well and therefor his character is actually not that strong? What are those leaps in logic?

Also knee is obviously out of the race. Doesnt matter if he plays drag, lili or feng, he is not good at T8 yet compared to the other top koreans. 

>There are many tournaments without Dragunov in the top 8 

Again, when a tournament takes place and 0 good dragunov players attend you cant use that as a fact against dragunov not being good. A 7 year old would understand this. We have a drag in top 8 all the time in ATL because there actually are dragunov players in korea. Now in evo japan we have 4 drags in top 50 which is already an overrepresentation of a character as there are 33 and one of them is in top 8. Also one of the drags happened to put another top drag into losers, we mightve ended up with 2 drags in top 8 otherwise.

Also wasnt the electric clash final we just had drag vs azucena in the finals? lol.

>Sub is absolutely wrong as they are expecting many Dragunovs and Azucenas in the top 8.

Without knowing who will attend evo japan sub was 100% correct to assume a lot of drags and azucenas will do well. Pakistan not getting their visas as arslan wouldve likely competet with azucena and jondding switching from azucena to eddy despite suggesting that he probably wont already eliminates some placements.

If anyone wouldve told you arslan ash, ulsan, JDCR, lowhigh and jondding would make it top 8, you wouldve unironically said that seems improbable?
        Tournament results are context data and sensical. You are grasping for straw. You are just being stupid.

Not only one player, Knee and Lowhigh played Dragunov but did not win ATL. JDCR finally won ATL after 5 ATL. As I said Dragunov is not even dominating Tekken 8 tournaments 

The fact is Dragunov is not dominating tournaments. Yup this sub is wrong. Many here predicted multiple Dragunov in the top 8 in Evo Japan.

You are salivating on 4 Dragunov in top 5. So from top 8 you stretched it top 50  to sound you have an argument.You are looking silly again. 4 Dragunov in top 50 is not over representation. Of course you expect Dragunov players like Nobi and JDCR  to at least make top 50. Don't be so stupid.

Multiple tournaments have a variety in the top 8. You are just again stupid. 

Correction no Dragunov won a tournament in Pakistan.
            >Tournament results are context data. You are grasping for straw

No, thats what you are doing. You're going: oh this one guy plays dragunov only got to the finals twice and only one one of the tournaments out of fucking 64 of the literal best players on earth, therefor the character he plays must not be that good. Thats you. Youre saying this.
                Nope. You are just stupid. What I said plenty of times overall Dragunov is not dominating tournaments. That's facts and data.Tournament results are context data and sensical. You are grasping for straw.

You can also draw albiet unlikely so its 33.333333333...%
    See you got a 33 1/3 chance of winning, but I, I got a 66 and 2/3 chance of winning, because Kurt Angle KNOWS he can't beat me and he's not even gonna try!
        The numbers spell Disaster!
    But you actually have a 50/50 chance of drawing though. You either draw or dont draw.
What are you yapping about?  Literally in every major fighting game tournament, you have to win a total of 6 rounds.  Whether that’s winning 2 matches with 3 rounds each, or winning 3 matches with 2 rounds each.  

With hundreds to a thousand of entrants, you think there is time for everyone to run a first to ten?  Being able to adapt quickly is a key skill in high level play.
    You're again defending the thing by saying it has always been like this

Each round is 60seconds max btw

It's not about being able to adapt quickly it's about being able to award the best player the win, a 6 round game especially in Tekken 8 with many 5050 forced moments does not do that very well
        No, dumb dumb.  I’m defending it because it’s logical, and only a freakin moron would suggest otherwise 😂
            > Literally in every major fighting game tournament, you have to win a total of 6 rounds.

You don't even know what you said
Should be -15 minimum
Pinya played Victor surprisingly.


The Raven who made top25 is Bobby. An up and coming player from Australia
So, what exactly makes Claudio good? I’ve only got a few hours of playtime with him, and I honestly couldn’t figure out what might make him particularly strong in this game. I’ve got even less playtime with Shaheen, but I can understand why he’s good. Ironically enough, Claudio has my highest win rate, but I feel like that was almost purely on knowledge checks.
    He's got very good fundamental stuff. He's got the best hopkick in the game as an exemple. He's got good movement, he's got decent keepaway, he has good frames, etc.
Wouldn't say he's completely preserved. Most of his CH launchers no longer ch launch like B33, F3, UF3 and 4. They also removed ff1+2 which was a really strong addition. UF 3+4 doesn't pick up consistently anymore. B1 and F3 doesn't screw mid-air opponents anymore.

His new DP move is absolutely ridiculous though.
    That isn't really any different to what other characters lost - including several of the ostensible top tiers. Most characters had several CH launchers stripped out and lost mid-air screws. He's still fundamentally intact and kept his best moves, including b1 and SS4.

I also think his heat is among the best in the game. Spammable starburst and a low (only -14 ob) heat smash combine to make him incredibly scary in heat.
    blue moon?
Because you can either be very minus or go into sentai mixup.

From sentai mixup if ff2 got blocked your opponent can make it a 50/50 by defending with duck/powercrush. Reina's hardest hiting option from sentai hits for i believe 40, if you duck or block a sentai move that's vulnerable to it you're getting a full combo. So it's disadvantageous because overall it will lead to more dmg for you than for reina. 

On top of that, you can just jab which trades with sentai 3 and beats everything else (maybe not the low option tho) if you don't want to take any risk. And again on top of that you can backdash which beats most of the options with the exception of i believe sentai 3+4 (the low) sentai 4 (flip kick) and sentai 1+3 (grab), but both sentai 4 and sentai 1+3 are reactable so doing that you can pretty much only get hit by the low. This doesn't work on every character but i'm pretty sure it works on most of them. 

She has options to deal with everything tho, like sentai into nothing if she expects a powercrush. But the deepness of the mindgames involve isn't viable. Like, what's the point of doing 10 feint in a row if at worst your opponent can chose to jab and the worst thing that can happen to him is he gets hit by a ~20 dmg low?
He has all of the tools you need in T8. And his damage is absurd. He kills in two touches which is super important in my opinion.
Nah people be sleeping on him. He does so much damage and has so many nasty setups. Just nobody plays him. Bummer the pakistani paul couldnt come to evo he wouldve bodied people left and right.
Now I took it personal

It would, actually. Cunt. No sarcasm in mine.
Tyvm. He has been asking me for almost a week for Jimmy and I told him over and over again I will do it when I see him lol.
Yeah she's a good tournament character, but still  not s tier. I feel like she's not oppressive enough to be s tier.
    I dunno man. There might be a case for it. I can't actually think of any weaknesses she has in T8.

Historically, it was her tracking, but her tracking is extremely good in T8. She also has top-tier mix.

I personally think she's better than at least 2 of the commonly cited S-tiers in tournament play.
        Yeah probably. Imo the only definitive s tier so far are feng (he just has everything, perfect character), drag (mostly because of his dmg) and Nina. And i feel like she isn't as good as they are. Compared to king, azu, etc tho? Yeah sure, she belongs with those.
            My hot take is that Feng is the best character in the game, followed closely by Drag and Nina. 

Ling, King, and Jun are overrated and won't hang in the top tiers long term (especially if Namco nerfs a few key moves).

Lili, Alisa, Law, and Claudio are all underrated.
Ling yeah, i don't think alissa's quite s tier tho
    I played a GoD Alisa yesterday. Never has she been so oppressive in any other Tekkens and been fighting a lot of decent Alisas since T6 arcade days. It's all guessing game. Some heat chain saws setups you can do nothing but block and take the chip since she's so plus on block . She has plenty of 5050 options if you guess wrong its over. I feel she's 100% S tier.
        Yeah maybe i guess. She's very good for sure.
This comment is the perfect example of what I am talking about. You're making balancing assumptions based on nonsensical things and without context.

The reason why in pakistan drag doesnt win every tournament is because the best pakistan players do not play dragunov.

>Lowhigh and Knee have not won ATL despite using Dragunov

JDCR won ATL with dragunov and ATL had drags in every single top 8. Once again this is one of those fallacies where ONE player ONCE didnt do well and therefor his character is actually not that strong? What are those leaps in logic?

Also knee is obviously out of the race. Doesnt matter if he plays drag, lili or feng, he is not good at T8 yet compared to the other top koreans. 

>There are many tournaments without Dragunov in the top 8 

Again, when a tournament takes place and 0 good dragunov players attend you cant use that as a fact against dragunov not being good. A 7 year old would understand this. We have a drag in top 8 all the time in ATL because there actually are dragunov players in korea. Now in evo japan we have 4 drags in top 50 which is already an overrepresentation of a character as there are 33 and one of them is in top 8. Also one of the drags happened to put another top drag into losers, we mightve ended up with 2 drags in top 8 otherwise.

Also wasnt the electric clash final we just had drag vs azucena in the finals? lol.

>Sub is absolutely wrong as they are expecting many Dragunovs and Azucenas in the top 8.

Without knowing who will attend evo japan sub was 100% correct to assume a lot of drags and azucenas will do well. Pakistan not getting their visas as arslan wouldve likely competet with azucena and jondding switching from azucena to eddy despite suggesting that he probably wont already eliminates some placements.

If anyone wouldve told you arslan ash, ulsan, JDCR, lowhigh and jondding would make it top 8, you wouldve unironically said that seems improbable?
    Tournament results are context data and sensical. You are grasping for straw. You are just being stupid.

Not only one player, Knee and Lowhigh played Dragunov but did not win ATL. JDCR finally won ATL after 5 ATL. As I said Dragunov is not even dominating Tekken 8 tournaments 

The fact is Dragunov is not dominating tournaments. Yup this sub is wrong. Many here predicted multiple Dragunov in the top 8 in Evo Japan.

You are salivating on 4 Dragunov in top 5. So from top 8 you stretched it top 50  to sound you have an argument.You are looking silly again. 4 Dragunov in top 50 is not over representation. Of course you expect Dragunov players like Nobi and JDCR  to at least make top 50. Don't be so stupid.

Multiple tournaments have a variety in the top 8. You are just again stupid. 

Correction no Dragunov won a tournament in Pakistan.
        >Tournament results are context data. You are grasping for straw

No, thats what you are doing. You're going: oh this one guy plays dragunov only got to the finals twice and only one one of the tournaments out of fucking 64 of the literal best players on earth, therefor the character he plays must not be that good. Thats you. Youre saying this.
            Nope. You are just stupid. What I said plenty of times overall Dragunov is not dominating tournaments. That's facts and data.Tournament results are context data and sensical. You are grasping for straw. 

You are salivating on 4 Dragunov in the top 5. So from top 8 you stretched it top 50  to sound you have an argument.You are looking silly again. 4 Dragunov in the top 50 is not over representation.

MANY IN THIS SUB MENTIONED THAT there will be many Dragunovs and Azucenas in the top 8 at Evo Japan. They are WRONG.
He is as bad as this sub is claiming him to be. Pros say he is OP but he is even stronger on our level, in regular ranked play he is simply the best character in the game.
    So why is there 1 in top 8? He’s a very easy character to pick up, if he was objectively that good pros would be playing him heavy.

Obviously this is one tournament but it begs the question. He honestly might be the best character but it’s clear that it’s not that insurmountable as people are making it out to be.
        >So why is there 1 in top 8? He’s a very easy character to pick up, if he was objectively that good pros would be playing him heavy.

Do I really have to answer this? Like is this a serious question? Okay ill try and not be toxic here, but I hate super dishonest takes like this. You're just pretending that the player doesn't matter, nobody - and I stress again NOBODY - said that drag is an autowin. On planet earth. It just helps, that's all. The vast majority of players still pick their fighter based on who they like playing, not everyone immediately jumps to top-tier to invalidate the work they put in into their main for 20 years.

>He honestly might be the best character but it’s clear that it’s not that insurmountable as people are making it out to be.

Again, nobody on planet earth and possibly the entire universe said this. Everyone is in agreement, pros and bads alike, that drag is a tad too strong and a top 3 character. That's it. You are making up a narrative that you can then do a "gotcha" against or something. Nobody said drag is like leeroy. Nobody.
            Did…you forget the whole original comment? We were talking about the primarily online takes of people in this sub talking about drag’s power level. I’m not making up a narrative it’s literally what we’re discussing in this thread.
                >The fact that there is only one Drag in finals and only four in top fifty is hysterical. 
Everyone with a bit of skill already knew how linear and predictable he was and the pro players just proved it. 
Will the hive mind complainers on this sub pivot towards Law now?

You mean this terrible take? 

>I’m not making up a narrative it’s literally what we’re discussing in this thread.
