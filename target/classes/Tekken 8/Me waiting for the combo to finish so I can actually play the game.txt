[[Me waiting for the combo to finish so I can actually play the game]]


First Tekken, I’m not having a good time. 


Waiting for the combo to end so i can get hit by another launcher
    I’m so scared to throw random launchers out, but my opponent? Balls to the wall
        Almost all neutral launchers can be jab punished. Always makes them walk back a few steps holding block after they realize this launcher spam bs isnt gonna work.
            A lot of df2 launchers are -7. Those which are do not launch crouching targets.
                Really? In my experience almost all df2s hit mid, but you’re saying they hit high or what? Odd, thanks for the info
                    They will hit crouchers but not launch usually unless its a counter hit, yoshis df2 works this way for instance. df2's that hit crouch and launch without CH are usually punishable
                        You’re so right, I always hopkick crouching targets but I guess idk… basically I never rlly noticed and was doing it by instinct, and uf3(yoshi hopkick) and df2 are so similar in my mind I thought they were the same move almost.
                    Can’t say for sure but I assume one’s that hit mid, but won’t give a full combo on hit, just based off the wording.
                        ? I’m not rlly sure what you’re trying to say. But DF2 and UF3/4 are ‘universal’ launchers and almost always hit mid don’t they? It’s why ducking against a king can be so dangerous because his hopkick hits mid and will launch you, same with df2. Maybe i’m missing something

Edit: i have no idea why I thought this,  I’m just so used to hopkick and df2 being practically the same move in my mind
                            I know Jins df2 doesn’t launch on hit, so. I could probably test and get back to you on that, but I assume the guy is talking about stuff like that.
                                Yeah I made an edit, I just instinctively have always hopkicked crouching targets, df2 and hopkick being so similar in framedata and launch angle… I was incorrectly remembering launching people with it despite actually hopkicking them lol.
                                    Yea, it’s more of an exception to a rule type of thing. df2 is -9, no launch, but can cancel into crouch dash. 

uf4 is the standard -13 that everyone (but Jun) *should* have. 

Another one is Bryan, who’s df2 doesn’t launch, but uses fb2. Which is actually -7 even with a launch property.
                    he's saying some df2 lauchers are safe on block and the ones that are do hit crouching opponents but it doesn't actually launch them for a combo like the unsafe df2's do which are usually -12/-14. Reina is an exception with her df2 being -12 AND doesn't launch crouching opponents.
                    Some like Asuka’s DF2 will hit people crouching but won’t launch them unless on its counter hit
                        Speaking of which Asuka has 4 launchers that doesn't have to be counters. 3 that hit mid/crouching opponents and 1 high.

By the way, how do you get the name of your mains under your username?
                            Go to the main page for the sub, hit the dots in the top right, change user flair, pick whichever you want. They don’t have Victor so I went with my next best character
                                Thanks!
                            Are we talking safe or all? DF2, B3, 1+2, F2 for mid and F4 for high, right?
                                English please.
                                    Well, these are the Tekken notations, U(p), D(own), B(ack), F(orward), so DF is down-forward input. 1-left arm, 2 right arm, 3 left leg, 4 right leg.

So DF2 is down+forward+2 (her mid safe launcher)
F2 is her tooth fairy, long range unsafe high launch
B3 is her backflip, that is technically unsafe, hard to punish though
1+2 is her squeeze move that is perfectly safe (-9frames) with fastest offensive move (sorry Yoshi) being 10 frames.

F4 is plus on block homing high, that leads to a specific combo route.
            I love launcher spammers. Makes d/f+1 setplay so much more satisfying.
        I have to respect my opponents who throw out launchers at every opportunity. I'd never have to guts to do so.
            What are launchers? 🚀
        Some ppl give me the confidence to do whatever i want. Sometimes it works
    The Xiaoyu throw that put you right next to her on the floor so she can start a combo directly 😤
        WANING MOON BABY!!!
        That throw is also one of my to go because it require 1 + 2 to break it 🤣
    I'll 🔌 idc. I can't stand gatekeepers that tries hard for no reason.
        Wdym??? Someone ls gatekeeping because they’re using combos? Just play offline or in a casual lobby then
            I have an 85 win rate in ranked ima mighty ruler. You know exactly what I mean by gatekeeping. Fake tryhsrds purposely staying at a certain rank to stop anyone from ranking up
                I unfortunately don’t know. I also dont know what that has to do with getting hit by a launcher
                It’s not me staying at a rank on purpose trying to get everyone to Garyu then mighty ruler. I’m like 33 percent there.
        You bought a fighting game expecting people not to fight? That's kinda wild. lol.
            You're purposely acting dumb as if you don't know exactly what I'm saying.
    Jun moment
    HAHA
Waiting for rage art to end
    Some rage arts feel like short movies, eg. Dragunov's
        I main Dragunov and I don't like doing Rage arts because they take so long. Bryan's too.
            Dragunov’s also just sucks. It gets cold and…he does an awkward hammer fist? I get what they were going for but it doesn’t look powerful and it’s lame on top of that.
                It's cold, simple, effective, and needs no words.  Like Dragunov.
                    I just wish it somehow involved him crawling around as that intro is one of my favorites. Dragunov looks so mad that his sneaking was interrupted.
                    But why does he suddenly have ice powers.
                        He doesn’t have ice powers, he has teleportation so he can beat your ass in siberia
                            That makes more sense actually.
                At least it's not like Shaheen's lol
                    What's wrong with surfing on the dude?
                        "I respect you as a fighter" - *surfs to the mall on the opponent's face*
                It kinda feels like a less thematically effective version of his T7 rage art.
                The frost effect isn't even a result of Dragunov having ice powers either, it's just a weird location change to the Arctic Snowfall stage in T7. At least when Devil Jin does a location change he laser swords you, or when Zafina does it, Azazel's arm reaches out to crush you.
        I wish there was an "opt-out" for rage art cinematography and if both players have it checked, it just fades out and back in, and game on.
            I wish there was an opt-out for rage arts altogether…
        My fps goes down 40 with dragunov's rage art
        Word, I love when fighting games are cinematic.
        Is his longer than average? They all feel long af to me.
    Looks around nervously in Negan
        TAKIN IT LIKE A CHAMP
        Negan kept bringing the worst episode of TWD back from the dead for years. Really rubbed the salt in the wound.
            It’s the best episode though. It’s brutal and unnerving, but that was the whole point and true to the source material. They executed it very well
    This is the main reason I was upset rage art / super moves were added to tekken 7
    My ideal fighting game uses Tekken 8’s system. Keep the heat system, lose the rage arts. Double the health and timer, make levels bigger, cut combos down to 75% of where they are now. 

Would need some tweaks but sometimes I feel like I am playing against 1-2 combos then a movie as is.
        You could try not getting launched
            I just meant to keep the gameplay more active even if you do get launched. 75% isn’t bad, it’s like 2 hits off most chains.
Now post your reaction to a Tag2 combo
    Every time i get nostalgic about tag2 i have to remind myself of the 100 damage staple combos and double capo bull fuckery to ground myself…(I would buy TT3 in a heart beat)
        lol double capos, double bobs, double changs, double Lili, there was some really crazy teams in that game. But I won’t lie, I do miss it, probably the most fun I’ve had in Tekken.
    You can go to the bathroom and make it back in time for the end of a TT2 combo.
    The good ol days
    I love getting wall carried from one end of the map to the other by a Nina, then watching as I take another 20 wallsplat hits from a tag assault.
    i think this is the essence of why people hate fighting king.

at least with a combo the other player has to display skill at every step to not drop.

king only needs to catch you out once and then you’re locked for 5-15 seconds.

same reason being frozen in PoE is universally hated.
        It doesn't take much skill at all not to drop most combos after you properly learn them.

King's throws give you a chance to break them so you have to catch them standing like using a low, but then on top of that king needs to mix up the throw so they don't break it. That's 2 interactions, not one. 

His longer chain throws I assume you're complaining about when you say 15 seconds give you multiple escapes as well making them require even more correct interactions.

He's not hated over "not letting you play the game" he's hated because people often can't properly break throws already, and he has some of the most powerful and ambiguous ones to break in the game. He also has the most throws to learn how to break out of any character putting tons of homework on the opponent. The universal throw buffs in 8 that strongly benefit him on top of all the usual things that make people hate King aren't helping either.
            Actaully King 2 would be the strongest King. You're fighting a severely nerfed King compared to King in T1 and T2. He would be literally banned from tournaments had they kept him the same.
        The throws can be broken, so if you're locked for "5-15" seconds that's on you. 

When he goes for a throw he exposes himself just as much as if you had thrown out a launcher. Only difference is you can't break a combo, but you can break a throw. 

Imagine you hit EWGF and the opponent doesn't get launched and they take 0 damage. That's essentially what King has to go through multiple times a match.
            Absurd comparison. His throw is eleven frames and you both reset at the same time. It’s much, much closer to a jab than a launcher. Except it does a ton more damage.
                How is the comparison absurd? It's more similar than you realize. I'll demonstrate with EWGF:

Technically EWGF is also eleven frames out of crouch dash, and even puts you at +5 or 6 on block. King's puts you at 0 when you break it, just like you said.

Both EWGF and King's throws can be ducked and punished, minus a few rare exceptions.

Also "it does a ton more damage" - only if you mess up like 3 times in a row, not including avoiding the initial throw. And it could also do 0 damage even if you successfully land the initial grab.
                    Except it takes at least 14 frames, because the cd will take 3. Even more absurd. King also has throws specifically to use against ducked characters. It does more damage compared to a jab! Jesus you’re disingenuous, too!
                        EWGF also has mid variants. Devil Kazuya's normal EWGF, Jin's AOS awakened god fist, etc.

"Except it takes at least 14 frames" 

1 - I said it was 11 OUT OF cd.

2 - Both Reina and Kazuya can do PEWGF, which is quicker than i14.

Like I said earlier, if you get half your life gone from a chain throw, that's your fault. 

You have at least 3 different chances to break the chain minimum, not counting the initial starting grab. 

Also grabs have way less reach than most launchers, longer recovery, and can be broken to take 0 damage.

TLDR: diagnosis: skill issue.
            The throws can be broken, so if you're locked for "5-15" seconds that's on you. 

* Care to explain in detail how to break those then? Those are hard to break. You sound like you've done this countless times before, what better way than to learn from someone with experience.
                Yeah so what I like to do is get hit by a throw and then hop in my time machine to right before I get thrown and try again until it works.

Hope this helps.

But if you want a complete answer just press 1 for right hand 2 for left 1+2 for both.

                    Did you down vote my comment?
                        I generally downvote AI peddlers, yes
        It's straight up the opposite. When I grab someone as King, unless it's an anti-crouch grab or something, I almost expect it to be escaped against decent people. This resets to neutral AND denies damage. In high levels of play this straight up undoes everything I did to get in.

On the flipside... Some arguably more frail human than King can flail their wrist or ankles around and keep me airborne or bouncing for the same or more of my healthbar with absolutely NO possibility for an escape. It can also be the same combo, too! Yet with King I also have to mix up throws that just get escaped.

Honestly though I like the challenge... and I find King to be the most fun and interesting character to play with.
Lol this was one of the most jarring things to experience when I first moved to Tekken years back “BRO WHERE’S MY BREAKER!” Lmao.
when someone starts comboing me through the window in the palace stage i know i can sit back for 30 seconds.
    god i hate that stage. and the desert one with like 3x drops.
        You can only floor break once in a combo, if you're floor broken twice you ate two combos. And descent into madness requires 3 floor breaks to hit the desert at the bottom - so that's three combos since the first floor requires a hard break (2 ground hits) to actually break.
            it only has 2 floor breaks.
                When the floor is normal you need to floor break once to cause lightning to strike and turn it purple. This will automatically happen during climax if it has not already occurred (rare, usually people will take advantage of these floor breaks for combo extensions as floor breaking is the easiest combo extension in the game as it doesn't have a positional requirement like wall breaks). 

There are two kinds of breaks, hard and regular.

Hard breaks require two hits that need to be done in two separate combos. 

Descent into subconscious is a hard floor break (the only one). Into the stratosphere has a floor bounce that functions the same as a floor break that activates in climax. 

Shrine and Estate both have a hard wall break that require hitting the same wall twice. Hitting it the first time will 'damage' the wall (the bricks that make up the wall in shrine will partially fall out, the glass wall in estate will spiderweb and bend) and the second will cause a break.
    triple wall break combos. because nobody learned from the mistake that was Howard Estate.
Love some of these comments like they never get launched 😂 literally the best players in the world get launched sometimes
    and like this is most fighting games people like. umvc3,sf6,kof,dbf... some might take a bit longer then others but that is just nature of fighting games.
        Yep, I'm not a massive fan of combo heavy games and prefer shorter more realistic combos but it's the way fighting games are going and we either quit or deal with it
            Virtua Fighter says hello 👋
                I really miss VF. I used to play in ever tournament available by train 😂 the combos in VF5 got longer and higher damage though

Soul Calibur is what I like though. The combos are normally on 2-3 hits and you have air control to get out of longer combos
                    That reversal edge though… 😬 they need to put SoulCalibur 2 HD on modern consoles. 
                        Yeah, SC2 was the last great SC game. I miss it so much, still play it sometimes on Dolphin
                            They did have an online one in HD on ps3 and 360. The 360 one is playable on Series X/S. No Link though 😆
                DOA with the hold system 

Also we have VF characters lmao
                    I seriously considered just getting back into DOA 5/6 after playing Tekken 8 for 70 hours 😂
                lowjab, lowjab,lowjab,lowjab
                I haven't played them, but I pray for VF6 coming out on steam
            > but it's the way fighting games are going

Was this comment made in 1994?
                Haha 😂 you certainly had combos back in the 90s. Especially on 2D fighters. However they have got progressively longer. Look at some older Tekken games, Tekken 4 had basically no juggles, Tekken 5 had a combo system but was limited, certain characters had wall travel and wall damage but most didn't (which is cool BTW and actually makes characters unique) tekken 6 was an odd game, it was less combo centric but the bound system made combos crazy. TTT2 WE DON'T TALK ABOUT!

Then Tekken 7 came along. Every character has long combos that do the same thing and everyone can go from wall to wall and deal 100 damage (bar very few characters)
        People here have no idea the bullshittery of UMVC3. There are teams in that game that lead to a 300% true combo that cannot be escaped. If you get touched once, you genuinely lose the entire round unless the opponent messes up their unblockable setup.
            Kusoge
        Lol I'm very new to this subreddit and I thought you were talking about some launching moves with those abbreviations. 
    No way, all of these people saying you can just jab punish launchers do it every time and never get launched! 😂

Everyone’s giving advice based on practice mode and not on real life situations. “Don’t you know you can just parry/punish/sidestep/counter hit everything when you know it’s coming?” 😆
    This is what all gaming subreddits are like. The League of Legends/Wild Rift subs are constantly filled with "X champ can't be OP, just dodge the skillshots" only for that champ to dominate pro play and high elo. Characters like Sejuani, Orianna, Syndra, Ezreal, Thresh, Lee Sin, Nautilus etc etc all have been really sticky in pro play and they very much utilize their skillshots.

They think they're fucking perfect and that the other people they're against can't possibly ever land a single thing. You see this same thing with rage art complaints, like sure dude you've *never* gotten hit by one and never used your own, totally believe you.
    You gotta make your opponent work for it. Then you won't feel bad when they land it.
        Exactly. Also you get the buzz when you combo them
I like how some of the comments are "well in my kusoge anime fighting game some combos take literally 30 seconds so having to sit through 10 second combos with ambiguous oki in T8 is nothing"...

Like the fact that some other games have it worse makes it less of a problem in this game 🤔
    I get your point but, Tekken's juggle system has been a core part of its identity for a very long time now. I don't see it as a problem as that's just Tekken.
    How is it a problem in any fighting game? This is like complaining people shoot guns in a shooter game
        Imagine there was a gun in counter strike that froze you in place for 10 seconds, while dealing consistent damage to roughly equate to 40% of your max HP. I wander why they dont do that, huh? (WC3 mod excluded)

Many other fighting games have at least one system that allows you to attempt to "break" the combos once a round. GG ST has burst, Netherealm's games have breakers etc. Tekken has nothing.
            Did you even think about your comment before posting it lol? 

Imagine if there was a gun in counterstrike that instantly killed you and then you literally didn’t get to play at all for up to almost 2 entire minutes in some cases. Oh wait, that’s all of them. Please explain how taking a combo for 10 seconds is less interactive than literally just being a spectator for minutes at a time
                You clearly have never played CS in your life and I appologise for assuming that you did. I should have used Forknife as an example for someone who is seriously comparing guns in FPS to getting stunlocked in FGs. I should have never tried to explain shit to you, but know this:

your take is bad and you should feel bad
                    You sound obnoxious lol stop sniffing your own farts
                        I sniff whatever the fk I want 😎💨
                    you sound comically stupid. Keep crying about the fighting in your fighting game tho
                        Lmaooo he got so mad. That's how you know you gotem
                        Go touch some grass my dude, give your remaining braincell a rest. Maybe then you'll finally realize how dumb your argument is.
                    Bro literally described every FPS with an objective game mode
    But it’s not a problem. It’s always been like that. You calling it a problem and adding an emoji changes nothing. You’re just garbage at the game
        "Its not a problem, because it's always been like this" is not a very compelling argument.

For example shitty netcode has "always been like this" but I see nobody who wouldn't want a better one. This is just an example out of a left field, but I hope I got my point across.

>!sucker!<😎
It's worse when they could have finished it with a short ender to finish the round but decided to use rage art instead.
    Rage Arts should be the length of Heat Smashes. They're the most useless part of the game, even casuals like me get bored of them
I like it, it gives time to regain composure and consider the oki properly instead of just jumping straight into it.
    Stay alert for dropped combos.
    I grew to not let it get to me as well. 

Like "okay so knowing this player they gonna try to spam the shoulder attack" and hopefully guess right and retaliate.
Tekken players when they can't press buttons for 10 seconds
    10 seconds is a lot when the timer is 60 seconds
Spam toggle the special controls button to distract your opponent into dropping the combo 😈
    Lmao top strat
You have clearly never played another fighting game. Tekken 8 combos are so short. Try Dragon Ball Fighterz out and see how infuriating getting combo'd for 30+ seconds is
    DBS Broly combos💀
    [deleted]
        I do think they’re long as well but this guy is right about some of the 2D games, touch of death is a thing
    When TOD is a common lingo among the players
Jesus it’s just scrub quote after scrub quote in this post. Tekken’s combo length has been pretty consistent since what, tekken 6? That shit came out in 2007, there’s been damn near 20yrs of tekken combos being tekken combos.
    Many people don't like it would prefer shorter combos or breakers or something. It is ok to talk about what you don't like a bout a game
    Tekken's Rage Art length has been pretty much the same since what, Tekken 7? That shit came out in 2015,  there's been damn near a decade of Tekken Rage Arts being Tekken Rage Arts
It gets easier when you learn what to look for and what moves not to just throw out (because they’re too punishable). Be patient and try not to hit buttons when it’s not your turn until you better understand what each character does.
Personally using that precious time to take a sip of water or scratch my nose, yawn, put on a podcast, study a course.
LMAOO
My favorite opponents are the ones that watched one YouTube video and only know one combo. Like I get it, you know 5 inputs. Shit’s just annoying.
    you need to block then
seriously man. it's hella lame.
If you think Tekken combos are long, UMVC3 would like a word
    Yeah or even MK1…knew I was gonna bounce off that game when I saw the same dialed-in combos that last for deadass 15 seconds while the opponent does reset after reset
        MK has combo breakers
In a combo? You're pushing buttons while waiting and then accidentally get counter-hit on wakeup or reset.

This is more like you got hit by a rage art
    Mashing 1/3 in the off chance that they'll drop the combo. Good times.
    This might be a problem I have. What am I supposed to do while being combo’d? Hold back to try and block, do nothing at all, do something else? Genuine question
        Air launched? Tech Roll. 99% of the time you can tech roll. You should be spamming 1 and 2 or 3 and 4 to roll out of bad combo tightness or just roll out when it finishes.
Yep and then you make them do this same gif when it's your turn 🤣
I take a drink and stretch my fingers a bit. It's like getting sniped in a FPS and you're looking at the idle gray screen timer.
The get in the lab comments are so sassy 😂. Being combo's today I felt like a wet fish flopping around in the air 😂. I was like this will never end. Good thing is it doesn't auto a loss.
There's a German word for this - gukken
(Gucken - look (at. smth) + Tekken)
I find the combos super satisfying to watch in this game personally. I love SF6, but watching Luke do drive rush HK - cr.HP drive rush HK - cr.HP and all combos go into level 3 super gets old. And I don't need to talk about MK1 that has hour long combos but it's the same one over and over. Tekken's cool in the sense that not every hit goes into one.
I love tekken but i agree, its out of control. Since tekken 6 people can even launch you when you are on the floor lol.

Thats why many of us consider tekken 5 peak tekken.
I use the time to get a beer or take a dump. Usually I’m back by the time it’s nearly done
That's part of the game. 
Is this your first FG?
The combo system in Tekken is so weird. You can do so much damage with a combo but the combo itself requires almost no execution. In other fighting games, optimal damage combos are really hard to execute, so you basically have to earn your damage, but in Tekken, I already see Warrior ranks doing optimal combos already. I guess you could argue, that you have earned your big damage combo by landing the launcher in the first place, but sometimes you just get launched by a random string because you literally just haven't seen this string yet (which happens a lot in a game with 30+ characters with 100+ moves each)
I love Tekken, but I was always scratching my head when it comes to their combo philosophy.
I am also not a fan of the throws in Tekken 8, but thats another topic
    Combo execution in Tekken has never been difficult, that goes back to older Tekkens as well, not just 8.

The difficulty in Tekken it's having 100 different moves per character, and once you reach high level, you have to learn many of those moves for different matches-up.
    The game's combo philosophy is pretty straightforward. Reward players for their risk. It's one of the reasons why people would complain about Steve's b1 as before you could basically wiff it and recover before any punishment can be dealt. Now it's just a Tk7 magic 4.

As for optimal damage you can always position yourself to reduce the damage. I'll sometimes purposefully fight with my shoulder to a wall to reduce movement options and as the old saying goes "sidewall saves lives". This usually is why people advocate for feild obstacles to prevent constant juggle combos but those create other problems if not handled well.

Throws you kind of just have to treat them like forward throws and they all have homing properties to make up for hiw easy they can be to break.
        I think the main issue for some players isn't the damage of a combo, it's how long it goes on for making it very boring. Sure it gives more time for them to mess up and drop the combo, but it's not like it's hard to not drop a combo you've practiced enough.
            I think combos go on for longer in Marvel and anime fighters tbh.
    Im not sure if this will be a unpopular opinion but to me Tekken isn't technically hard like Street Fighter or other 2d fighters. However, the knowledge requirement is significantly higher than 2d fighters. Thats why I do not understand the special style addition outside of consistently hit frame perfects with select characters I don't find any inputs difficult, it's probably the easiest fighting game to start but quickly requires matchup knowledge to advance in skill.
        Yep, pretty much, Street Fighter is about execution, the higher the level of competition, the tighter the execution, and faster reaction time will be required.

Difficulty in Tekken is about knowledge checks, to know what's the opponent gonna do, especially at high level.

Yeah, I don't think special style was needed in Tekken at all, but then I understand that Namco was trying to pull even more casuals than the usual (Tekken already pulls a lot of casuals).
    clearly you've never seen lee combos. the amount of execution to pull off an optimal lee combo is insane and the damage it does does not reflect the effort.
        This was true in t7, now in t8 lee is one of the characters with higher damage potential becuase of his new wallcombo spike
            Eh, it's still kinda weird to do MSS cancels to get a combo that deals more than 60 damage. I'd say Nina's a better example of a character who got their combos "dumbed down".
                i dont think lee's combos got dumbed down, but the idea that he has to work hard for low damage is no longer true
        It's so frustrating, especially when going up against high damage dealers like paul, dragonov, king, etc. When the opponent gets a free 50+ dmg combo off heat smash, Just makes you want to throw the controller
        Lee's combos are not THAT much harder compared to other characters. Especially in T8.
    And that's true. High damage combos in any King Of Fighters are difficult to execute '
    Speak for yourself, I am constantly whiffing combos in a panic. If I can actually get any launchers out that is.
    Green ranks do it too. Some players literally throw out 0 jabs or strings, they just try to launch and then do their 100 damage combo over and over. They're easy to beat but it's just like there's no way they are getting better at the game not even attempting to learn any mechanics other than their extremely long combo.
    Ehh, try learning to do some of Steves optimal combos consistently. Some characters just have harder execution.

Some examples:

Counterhit b1~FLK > EXT DCK 1 > df+1,2~1~FLK~DCK~iWS 1 > f+2,2 > LNH 2 T! > dash LWV 1,2 > DCK 1	

PAB df+2 > PAB f+1+2 > f+2,1~FLK~DCK~iWS+2,2 > LNH 2 T! LWV 1,2 > LNH 2
Use the time to think, maybe you won't get combo'd so much.
    Hold up, you expect players to try thinking about why they're getting hit?
    Even at the highest rank people get launched all the time, it's not like you can avoid it
        They still take the time to think though, instead of getting annoyed that combos exist.
You act like getting stuck in the corner in MK is any different
    You act like I even played MK1
        Didn't say mk 1 any 2d mk is the same
I stress eat between rounds. Sometimes I eat during the combos and ragearts because they take FOREVER!!!!
I think increasing knockback on many of the moves would make this game less about air time and a bit more about pokes and such
    [deleted]
        Ah yes. cr.MK into full combo: the game. 

The game would probably be more footsies centric in theory, but drive rush from neutral and confirming into drive rush for combos make it far less “pokey” than Tekken. I think tekkens pressure game is far more oppressive, especially with heat, but getting in to start that pressure from neutral is much harder than SF6.
Just play neutral better and don't get launched. Its that simple 5head.
    Just win the game it's that simple
        Real
I was actually thinking about this again..
I wonder how many ukemi attempts are missed....
I can't really be mad at my opponent for repeatedly launching me when it's my fault for repeatedly walking into it.
It be like that
Vs Jin. Everytime LOL
LOL this is me 😂
That happens to me too. I just relax my hands cuz it’s game over.
This just gives me Tekken 6 flashbacks. I'm still getting combo'd on this very day.
I was playing with some people on a discord server  and while spectating. The jin launched the devil jin and you could hear the devil jin player literally  crack open a soda/beer can as he was getting combo'ed. I lost my shit.
im a dragon ball fighterZ player, tekken combos are like a litle rest for me lol
Try out DBZ fighters lol those combos can last 30seconds straight
Ngl this game has been my least favorite new player experience.
Yup that happened to me to. I took me 30 hours to understand how to think in 3D (since you can move around all the fkn map).  
I choose a character and I practiced some lage high-damage combos (in tutorial mode).  
Then I started having a great time, because I was actually destroying my opponets with the same (or better) combos that they did to me >:D

My bad
They took my Tekken 7 back. I downloaded it and played it for over a month. WTH? NOW THEY SAID TO PLAY IT I WOULD GAVE TO PAY ALMOST $100. NO WAY.
    What are you taking about
My problem is a lot of times peoples wifi only has one level of signal which causes the game to glitch. Pisses me off. I'm 4 combos ahead of them but nope glitchy glitchy. All that practice for nothing.
How is this the first Tekken you're not having a good time if previous Tekkens have long combos?
Me asf 😂
Everyone’s so quick to defend the juggles lol it’s weird
    It’s a core part of tekkens identity, it wouldn’t be tekken without it. High damage combos been in the games since tekken 1, and they’ve been long since tekken 6 about 15 years ago. It’s a punishment for your mistakes.

It’s weirder that you have a post saying to nerf juggles tbh
        No they're not, stop lying with this "wouldn't be tekken without it" crap, you already admitted it took 6 enteries before this ridiculous combo time became a factor, so happens tekken 5 is ALOT of people's favorites

Nobody's asking for juggles to do less damage, yes high damage combo's are good 👍 but nobody wants to sit through an ad every launch while the other guy blast his control for 30 seconds, i get its fun to pull off, you can argue that you enjoy it, and hell i sometimes enjoy it too, but the annoyance for those on the receiving end aswell as viewers is way too big of a con to justify it in my opinion

If you wanna combo, go play devil may cry, but this is a multiplayer game, there's more to be considered here, then your strawman'd argument of "oh well you just dont wanna get punished for your mistakes"

I'd even argue shorter combos are way more sadisfying to pull off, you get those big chunks from big chunky hits, slam the opponent into the ground, they go flying, and back to business
            > I'd even argue shorter combos are way more sadisfying to pull off, you get those big chunks from big chunky hits, slam the opponent into the ground, they go flying, and back to business

This is why I main Paul.
                Same for bryan, i know bryan has long combo's, but i dont use em, cuz i can get pretty big damage without em, and just punching the shit out of everyone is always more fun then whatever optimal bullshit i could dedicate 2 hours in the lab to learning, like they never even look cool, whats the point?

Also funny im getting downvotes, when im flat out saying its my opinion and that both sides has pros and cons (even if i do believe my opinion has a stronger basis to stand on) classic tekken community i guess 🤣
        Core part of tekken, that has becomes bigger each release to the point where its just too much. Give me tekken 5 level juggles
            70% off of a df2 without walls incoming
            Yes thank you. It should go back to tekken 5 levels of juggle, the good days like mvc2
        No it just came in tekken 6, idk when it was decided that it was a core part of Tekkens identity lol
            Juggles or air combos have always been a part of the games. Bounds, screws/T-spins, pick-ups, and the 54 other combo extenders came with 6. People seem to be conflating the two and arguing about nothing.
                The long juggles was not a thing until 6
        And even more weird you snooped on my profile in an attempt to over defend juggles lol yall r funny
        I’ve always thought there should be a cap on natural combos without wall breaks. Heat should extend it by one small segment but I have always felt 80+ damage makes it unfair as certain characters can do it easily while others take crazy execution. The reward for a 15f launcher should be more uniform across characters imo.
    i legitimately don’t understand why juggles need “defending.” have any of you ever played a fighting game before? T8 juggles are nothing compared to most games lol
        Name a few
            get hit a single time in DBFZ, MK1 and MKX, literally every Marvel game and you are watching a one minute cutscene. T8 is so much faster paced than most fighting games, this is such a crazy take lol
                Dbfz is accurate, MK GAMES HAVE COMBO BREAKERS, and Marvel vs capcom juggles are more balanced, shorter, and way harder to pull off.
                    that you think MARVEL of all games is more balanced than T8 tells me all i need to know. genuinely only something you could possibly say if you have literally never seen any Marvel be played lmao
                        Not the game, just the juggles. Also again aerial combos are much harder to pull off, everyone’s dishing out Tekken juggles even in the low ranks.
            To add on what other people have said about other games having much longer combos (DBFZ and MvC particularly), it's worth noting that Tekken in general is extremely fast. So much so, that the standard of play is 3 rounds instead of 2 rounds like almost every other game. That's another big evidence as for why juggles in Tekken aren't as long as you think they are. Yeah they may do a lot of damage, but at least they're quick.
    Honestly Tekken is great, but doesn't have the most beautiful combos. Almost all combos seem to be juggles.
        In my opinion they went overboard on the juggles
    It's a core aspect of the whole game, if you don't like juggles why even play Tekken
        Tekken has a lot of good things that are unique to it that aren't juggles. Arguably one of Tekken's stronger points is that the core gameplay is closer to the logic of real martial arts (bears and robots aside), and the extended DDR solitaire sequences - excuse me, juggles - are the aberration.
            Right
        It’s not the core aspect lol and like I always say nobody said get rid of juggles completely, nerf it so people like yall don’t think the game is ONLY about juggles.”core aspect”..every fighting game has juggles but notice how it’s not a core aspect
            There’s a big difference between being ‘A’ core aspect and ‘THE’ core aspect. Please learn reading comprehension before discussing.
                “If you don’t like juggles why even play tekken” the way you and everyone else defending tekken juggles like it’s your mom, I’d say you meant “the” core aspect lol
I got even bored of doing my own combos, oh no not again pressing the same buttons for half a minute to get some damage in
    Why play fighting games if you don’t like doing combos lol
        endless juggles are just boring, just get that damage in and all good, it's not that hard to press those buttons, you and your opponent just get bored to death especialy after landing two walls in a row lol

and it's not like every fighting game consists of endless juggling haha
Take the time to think about why you got launched. 

Did you do something stupid or did you get read like a book?
... But that's the game !
    Dude these replies are killing me lmao. It’s not like this is dbfz or something
        I could legitimately go to the bathroom and come back before a DBFZ combo ends. Trash design lol
        DBFz wishes it had walls AND floors to break to extend combos ! 

Last match, I could run to the door, get the pizzas, come back, and the juggle was not done !?. 

Thank you Tekken for letting me get pizzas at the door mid-match ! 

Top tier game ! 

I hope watching Netflix becomes close to viable during T9's matches, that would really be great !!
            You’re not seriously implying dbfz has shorter combos than t8 are you? 😂
At first I didn't understand these takes about whoever starts a string first basically wins but after playing dozens of matches I now see the truth. 


It really is all about racing for first string. 


As soon as they start may as well grab a snack
>First Tekken, I’m not having a good time.

Happy to have you. 

Nearly all situations you're put in are either fully preventable or are capable of being mitigated
type of mfer that eats tech rollable setups lol then goes on reddit to complain about never ending combos
Solution: don't get launched
    Solution to losing? Just win, bro
        Fax
    You get launched, everyone gets launched, no one doesn’t get launched
        you can pretty easily limit how often you get launched in tekken though. If you just stop pressing attack buttons it helps a lot.
            Ohh is that all lol
            Who needs attack buttons? Guess ill win by walking only then
        That solution is only for OP due to his "complaints"
    Gotta take risks to get damage in, and sometimes you'll just get launched. Part of the game and it's wonderful
Gotta learn footsies. For the most part, block more than you think you need to.
    Kind of missing the point that even the best players will spend a lot of time being combo'd. Just part of the game.
        I was watching devilster set vs atif butt's Kazuya, and half of it was like a combo video, it must have been infuriating 
        yeah but he’s new, so it’s not relevant. he won’t be one of the best for years. he’s getting combo’s way more.
Playing against King and he chaingrab you be like.

That's exactly why I don't play dbfz anymore and don't plan on playing project l
If you like juggling so much, join the circus smh
What? I thought new game was perfect and had no flaws.
That's how tekken is. It may not be for you.
    Many people don't like combos that long. Maybe the devs should consider toning them down?
        That's literally never going to happen.
Seriously, the combo system became super long and nub friendly
    Combos have been long for a while now lol.
        With heat stuff it's even longer
            You saying Tag 2 era combos were shorter?
                I played both and they were shorter, most of them anyway especially when you compare wall to wall
But, bro, we've gotta get the eSports crowd hyped. If they're not seeing wall-to-wall explosions, cutscenes, particle effects, flippy-dippy spins, and nine-minute combos that do 6.5 million damage from one launcher, they won't be super stoked about our matches.
Yyyup. This new over-emphasis on juggles and endless combos is killing my enjoyment for the direction the franchise is taking.
Tekken 8 is hot garbage this game is all about cash grab like the rest of the fighting games
    Lol cope
I’ve fought like 7 Claudio’s and I’m sure I haven’t beaten any of them. Garyu rank here
Same dude.
You definitely don't want to play Skullgirls.
Laughs in CDC dragunov wall carry
Nowhere NEAR as bad as mk1
You'll like MK1 then. Raiden with Sardine will combo you for so long, you'll be able to go smoke, drink coffee, take a shit, and by the time you are back your character is still being juggled.
Mash techroll
they need this game to add melty blood's reduce damage system

it would work like KI, but instead of a combo breaker, you calling out the right leg, arm, left or right, reduces the damage of the combo and increases scaling as combo extends

I'd also make rage arts throwable or removed from game, they are so fucking annoying
More time to strategize and consider your next move.
Man if I had a $1 for Everytime someone complained about not being able to run their own offense 24/7 I'd be rich as hell.
Waiting for the DBFZ combo to end:
My head saying I messed up somewhere but my heart says this is bullshit.
This is how resets function
That’s when I go take a shit OP.
@ Lars
thought this was a mortal kombat post
We have this conversation every game
Try Soulcalibur
    Is it still active?
If you think T8 is bad for lengthy combos, don’t even bother with mk1. Watching the same optimal combos for 30 seconds is shockingly not fun in the slightest .
Why does this actor exude villain energy?
that times for scheming
This is why every fighting game needs the hold system from DOA

You can counter throw your opponent even mid combo but if they predict it they can throw you for even more damage 

Endless combos are boring af to watch and even worse to receive, giving the guy on defense a way to swing it into their attack makes it fun
    This sounds cool
Heard of a little game called Fist of the North Star?
It's me seeing azucena rage art for the 3rd time during the set 😭
Playing Tekken for ages and still I push random buttons in hope it somehow 'breaks' the juggle, knowing full well it never does.
Bro wouldn't last 3 matches in DBFZ
You know you can do the same thing right?
Or King's string of grabs lmao
Average reina experience
Play MvC2. When magneto or iron man touches you, pull up your phone and start scrolling through reddit.
bruh ... in that estate level with multiple breaks .... dude carried me from inside to the bottom floor in all 3 sets. I'm sitting here like "this MF spends too much time in practice mode"
Victor  
Reina  
Kuni  
all 2D Characters

all guilty of this

at least my boy King is gonna do the same damage for way less hits bro
Even when you're getting combo'd, you still have to think about what's going to happen once it ends, so you're still engaging with the game if you're thinking, anyway.
It's sad there's no combo breaker like MK1
    Combo breakers would not really work in Tekken.

The moves are balanced around them being able to be punished heavily. Combo breakers would break the game since people would just throw out the riskiest shit and they wouldn't get punished as hard if they can just undo their unga bunga easily.
More like me waiting for hworang to stop pressing buttons so I can press a button.....then get ch.
Me when I get hit in the fighting game: 😫🤬😢
    Fellow Law main, don’t do this
How the hell do you stop these massive combos?!
Lars moment
My opponents once I touch them once with Jack-8
Congrats 🎉! Time to learn defense…
I usually take that time to take a breath and think how I'm going to handle the rest of the march. Also , If they keep relunching you, You don't have to immediately stand up after the combos done.
I used to hate this. But I realized: how do you model training in martial arts to hit harder?

In Tekken, it's learning the combo strings for after the launcher. I've come to accept it.

Now that I accept it, I do just have to wait, but I still have fun playing. Because I know some too. So when I hit the launcher, *they* get to wait.
Play something else.
HAHAHA!! This is actually funny cause it be like that sometimes
I’m so scared to throw random launchers out, but my opponent? Balls to the wall
    Almost all neutral launchers can be jab punished. Always makes them walk back a few steps holding block after they realize this launcher spam bs isnt gonna work.
        A lot of df2 launchers are -7. Those which are do not launch crouching targets.
            Really? In my experience almost all df2s hit mid, but you’re saying they hit high or what? Odd, thanks for the info
                They will hit crouchers but not launch usually unless its a counter hit, yoshis df2 works this way for instance. df2's that hit crouch and launch without CH are usually punishable
                    You’re so right, I always hopkick crouching targets but I guess idk… basically I never rlly noticed and was doing it by instinct, and uf3(yoshi hopkick) and df2 are so similar in my mind I thought they were the same move almost.
                Can’t say for sure but I assume one’s that hit mid, but won’t give a full combo on hit, just based off the wording.
                    ? I’m not rlly sure what you’re trying to say. But DF2 and UF3/4 are ‘universal’ launchers and almost always hit mid don’t they? It’s why ducking against a king can be so dangerous because his hopkick hits mid and will launch you, same with df2. Maybe i’m missing something

Edit: i have no idea why I thought this,  I’m just so used to hopkick and df2 being practically the same move in my mind
                        I know Jins df2 doesn’t launch on hit, so. I could probably test and get back to you on that, but I assume the guy is talking about stuff like that.
                            Yeah I made an edit, I just instinctively have always hopkicked crouching targets, df2 and hopkick being so similar in framedata and launch angle… I was incorrectly remembering launching people with it despite actually hopkicking them lol.
                                Yea, it’s more of an exception to a rule type of thing. df2 is -9, no launch, but can cancel into crouch dash. 

uf4 is the standard -13 that everyone (but Jun) *should* have. 

Another one is Bryan, who’s df2 doesn’t launch, but uses fb2. Which is actually -7 even with a launch property.
                he's saying some df2 lauchers are safe on block and the ones that are do hit crouching opponents but it doesn't actually launch them for a combo like the unsafe df2's do which are usually -12/-14. Reina is an exception with her df2 being -12 AND doesn't launch crouching opponents.
                Some like Asuka’s DF2 will hit people crouching but won’t launch them unless on its counter hit
                    Speaking of which Asuka has 4 launchers that doesn't have to be counters. 3 that hit mid/crouching opponents and 1 high.

By the way, how do you get the name of your mains under your username?
                        Go to the main page for the sub, hit the dots in the top right, change user flair, pick whichever you want. They don’t have Victor so I went with my next best character
                            Thanks!
                        Are we talking safe or all? DF2, B3, 1+2, F2 for mid and F4 for high, right?
                            English please.
                                Well, these are the Tekken notations, U(p), D(own), B(ack), F(orward), so DF is down-forward input. 1-left arm, 2 right arm, 3 left leg, 4 right leg.

So DF2 is down+forward+2 (her mid safe launcher)
F2 is her tooth fairy, long range unsafe high launch
B3 is her backflip, that is technically unsafe, hard to punish though
1+2 is her squeeze move that is perfectly safe (-9frames) with fastest offensive move (sorry Yoshi) being 10 frames.

F4 is plus on block homing high, that leads to a specific combo route.
        I love launcher spammers. Makes d/f+1 setplay so much more satisfying.
    I have to respect my opponents who throw out launchers at every opportunity. I'd never have to guts to do so.
        What are launchers? 🚀
    Some ppl give me the confidence to do whatever i want. Sometimes it works
The Xiaoyu throw that put you right next to her on the floor so she can start a combo directly 😤
    WANING MOON BABY!!!
    That throw is also one of my to go because it require 1 + 2 to break it 🤣
I'll 🔌 idc. I can't stand gatekeepers that tries hard for no reason.
    Wdym??? Someone ls gatekeeping because they’re using combos? Just play offline or in a casual lobby then
        I have an 85 win rate in ranked ima mighty ruler. You know exactly what I mean by gatekeeping. Fake tryhsrds purposely staying at a certain rank to stop anyone from ranking up
            I unfortunately don’t know. I also dont know what that has to do with getting hit by a launcher
            It’s not me staying at a rank on purpose trying to get everyone to Garyu then mighty ruler. I’m like 33 percent there.
    You bought a fighting game expecting people not to fight? That's kinda wild. lol.
        You're purposely acting dumb as if you don't know exactly what I'm saying.
Jun moment
HAHA
Some rage arts feel like short movies, eg. Dragunov's
    I main Dragunov and I don't like doing Rage arts because they take so long. Bryan's too.
        Dragunov’s also just sucks. It gets cold and…he does an awkward hammer fist? I get what they were going for but it doesn’t look powerful and it’s lame on top of that.
            It's cold, simple, effective, and needs no words.  Like Dragunov.
                I just wish it somehow involved him crawling around as that intro is one of my favorites. Dragunov looks so mad that his sneaking was interrupted.
                But why does he suddenly have ice powers.
                    He doesn’t have ice powers, he has teleportation so he can beat your ass in siberia
                        That makes more sense actually.
            At least it's not like Shaheen's lol
                What's wrong with surfing on the dude?
                    "I respect you as a fighter" - *surfs to the mall on the opponent's face*
            It kinda feels like a less thematically effective version of his T7 rage art.
            The frost effect isn't even a result of Dragunov having ice powers either, it's just a weird location change to the Arctic Snowfall stage in T7. At least when Devil Jin does a location change he laser swords you, or when Zafina does it, Azazel's arm reaches out to crush you.
    I wish there was an "opt-out" for rage art cinematography and if both players have it checked, it just fades out and back in, and game on.
        I wish there was an opt-out for rage arts altogether…
    My fps goes down 40 with dragunov's rage art
    Word, I love when fighting games are cinematic.
    Is his longer than average? They all feel long af to me.
Looks around nervously in Negan
    TAKIN IT LIKE A CHAMP
    Negan kept bringing the worst episode of TWD back from the dead for years. Really rubbed the salt in the wound.
        It’s the best episode though. It’s brutal and unnerving, but that was the whole point and true to the source material. They executed it very well
This is the main reason I was upset rage art / super moves were added to tekken 7
My ideal fighting game uses Tekken 8’s system. Keep the heat system, lose the rage arts. Double the health and timer, make levels bigger, cut combos down to 75% of where they are now. 

Would need some tweaks but sometimes I feel like I am playing against 1-2 combos then a movie as is.
    You could try not getting launched
        I just meant to keep the gameplay more active even if you do get launched. 75% isn’t bad, it’s like 2 hits off most chains.
Every time i get nostalgic about tag2 i have to remind myself of the 100 damage staple combos and double capo bull fuckery to ground myself…(I would buy TT3 in a heart beat)
    lol double capos, double bobs, double changs, double Lili, there was some really crazy teams in that game. But I won’t lie, I do miss it, probably the most fun I’ve had in Tekken.
You can go to the bathroom and make it back in time for the end of a TT2 combo.
The good ol days
I love getting wall carried from one end of the map to the other by a Nina, then watching as I take another 20 wallsplat hits from a tag assault.
i think this is the essence of why people hate fighting king.

at least with a combo the other player has to display skill at every step to not drop.

king only needs to catch you out once and then you’re locked for 5-15 seconds.

same reason being frozen in PoE is universally hated.
    It doesn't take much skill at all not to drop most combos after you properly learn them.

King's throws give you a chance to break them so you have to catch them standing like using a low, but then on top of that king needs to mix up the throw so they don't break it. That's 2 interactions, not one. 

His longer chain throws I assume you're complaining about when you say 15 seconds give you multiple escapes as well making them require even more correct interactions.

He's not hated over "not letting you play the game" he's hated because people often can't properly break throws already, and he has some of the most powerful and ambiguous ones to break in the game. He also has the most throws to learn how to break out of any character putting tons of homework on the opponent. The universal throw buffs in 8 that strongly benefit him on top of all the usual things that make people hate King aren't helping either.
        Actaully King 2 would be the strongest King. You're fighting a severely nerfed King compared to King in T1 and T2. He would be literally banned from tournaments had they kept him the same.
    The throws can be broken, so if you're locked for "5-15" seconds that's on you. 

When he goes for a throw he exposes himself just as much as if you had thrown out a launcher. Only difference is you can't break a combo, but you can break a throw. 

Imagine you hit EWGF and the opponent doesn't get launched and they take 0 damage. That's essentially what King has to go through multiple times a match.
        Absurd comparison. His throw is eleven frames and you both reset at the same time. It’s much, much closer to a jab than a launcher. Except it does a ton more damage.
            How is the comparison absurd? It's more similar than you realize. I'll demonstrate with EWGF:

Technically EWGF is also eleven frames out of crouch dash, and even puts you at +5 or 6 on block. King's puts you at 0 when you break it, just like you said.

Both EWGF and King's throws can be ducked and punished, minus a few rare exceptions.

Also "it does a ton more damage" - only if you mess up like 3 times in a row, not including avoiding the initial throw. And it could also do 0 damage even if you successfully land the initial grab.
                Except it takes at least 14 frames, because the cd will take 3. Even more absurd. King also has throws specifically to use against ducked characters. It does more damage compared to a jab! Jesus you’re disingenuous, too!
                    EWGF also has mid variants. Devil Kazuya's normal EWGF, Jin's AOS awakened god fist, etc.

"Except it takes at least 14 frames" 

1 - I said it was 11 OUT OF cd.

2 - Both Reina and Kazuya can do PEWGF, which is quicker than i14.

Like I said earlier, if you get half your life gone from a chain throw, that's your fault. 

You have at least 3 different chances to break the chain minimum, not counting the initial starting grab. 

Also grabs have way less reach than most launchers, longer recovery, and can be broken to take 0 damage.

TLDR: diagnosis: skill issue.
        The throws can be broken, so if you're locked for "5-15" seconds that's on you. 

* Care to explain in detail how to break those then? Those are hard to break. You sound like you've done this countless times before, what better way than to learn from someone with experience.
            Yeah so what I like to do is get hit by a throw and then hop in my time machine to right before I get thrown and try again until it works.

Hope this helps.

But if you want a complete answer just press 1 for right hand 2 for left 1+2 for both.

                Did you down vote my comment?
                    I generally downvote AI peddlers, yes
    It's straight up the opposite. When I grab someone as King, unless it's an anti-crouch grab or something, I almost expect it to be escaped against decent people. This resets to neutral AND denies damage. In high levels of play this straight up undoes everything I did to get in.

On the flipside... Some arguably more frail human than King can flail their wrist or ankles around and keep me airborne or bouncing for the same or more of my healthbar with absolutely NO possibility for an escape. It can also be the same combo, too! Yet with King I also have to mix up throws that just get escaped.

Honestly though I like the challenge... and I find King to be the most fun and interesting character to play with.
god i hate that stage. and the desert one with like 3x drops.
    You can only floor break once in a combo, if you're floor broken twice you ate two combos. And descent into madness requires 3 floor breaks to hit the desert at the bottom - so that's three combos since the first floor requires a hard break (2 ground hits) to actually break.
        it only has 2 floor breaks.
            When the floor is normal you need to floor break once to cause lightning to strike and turn it purple. This will automatically happen during climax if it has not already occurred (rare, usually people will take advantage of these floor breaks for combo extensions as floor breaking is the easiest combo extension in the game as it doesn't have a positional requirement like wall breaks). 

There are two kinds of breaks, hard and regular.

Hard breaks require two hits that need to be done in two separate combos. 

Descent into subconscious is a hard floor break (the only one). Into the stratosphere has a floor bounce that functions the same as a floor break that activates in climax. 

Shrine and Estate both have a hard wall break that require hitting the same wall twice. Hitting it the first time will 'damage' the wall (the bricks that make up the wall in shrine will partially fall out, the glass wall in estate will spiderweb and bend) and the second will cause a break.
triple wall break combos. because nobody learned from the mistake that was Howard Estate.
and like this is most fighting games people like. umvc3,sf6,kof,dbf... some might take a bit longer then others but that is just nature of fighting games.
    Yep, I'm not a massive fan of combo heavy games and prefer shorter more realistic combos but it's the way fighting games are going and we either quit or deal with it
        Virtua Fighter says hello 👋
            I really miss VF. I used to play in ever tournament available by train 😂 the combos in VF5 got longer and higher damage though

Soul Calibur is what I like though. The combos are normally on 2-3 hits and you have air control to get out of longer combos
                That reversal edge though… 😬 they need to put SoulCalibur 2 HD on modern consoles. 
                    Yeah, SC2 was the last great SC game. I miss it so much, still play it sometimes on Dolphin
                        They did have an online one in HD on ps3 and 360. The 360 one is playable on Series X/S. No Link though 😆
            DOA with the hold system 

Also we have VF characters lmao
                I seriously considered just getting back into DOA 5/6 after playing Tekken 8 for 70 hours 😂
            lowjab, lowjab,lowjab,lowjab
            I haven't played them, but I pray for VF6 coming out on steam
        > but it's the way fighting games are going

Was this comment made in 1994?
            Haha 😂 you certainly had combos back in the 90s. Especially on 2D fighters. However they have got progressively longer. Look at some older Tekken games, Tekken 4 had basically no juggles, Tekken 5 had a combo system but was limited, certain characters had wall travel and wall damage but most didn't (which is cool BTW and actually makes characters unique) tekken 6 was an odd game, it was less combo centric but the bound system made combos crazy. TTT2 WE DON'T TALK ABOUT!

Then Tekken 7 came along. Every character has long combos that do the same thing and everyone can go from wall to wall and deal 100 damage (bar very few characters)
    People here have no idea the bullshittery of UMVC3. There are teams in that game that lead to a 300% true combo that cannot be escaped. If you get touched once, you genuinely lose the entire round unless the opponent messes up their unblockable setup.
        Kusoge
    Lol I'm very new to this subreddit and I thought you were talking about some launching moves with those abbreviations. 
No way, all of these people saying you can just jab punish launchers do it every time and never get launched! 😂

Everyone’s giving advice based on practice mode and not on real life situations. “Don’t you know you can just parry/punish/sidestep/counter hit everything when you know it’s coming?” 😆
This is what all gaming subreddits are like. The League of Legends/Wild Rift subs are constantly filled with "X champ can't be OP, just dodge the skillshots" only for that champ to dominate pro play and high elo. Characters like Sejuani, Orianna, Syndra, Ezreal, Thresh, Lee Sin, Nautilus etc etc all have been really sticky in pro play and they very much utilize their skillshots.

They think they're fucking perfect and that the other people they're against can't possibly ever land a single thing. You see this same thing with rage art complaints, like sure dude you've *never* gotten hit by one and never used your own, totally believe you.
You gotta make your opponent work for it. Then you won't feel bad when they land it.
    Exactly. Also you get the buzz when you combo them
I get your point but, Tekken's juggle system has been a core part of its identity for a very long time now. I don't see it as a problem as that's just Tekken.
How is it a problem in any fighting game? This is like complaining people shoot guns in a shooter game
    Imagine there was a gun in counter strike that froze you in place for 10 seconds, while dealing consistent damage to roughly equate to 40% of your max HP. I wander why they dont do that, huh? (WC3 mod excluded)

Many other fighting games have at least one system that allows you to attempt to "break" the combos once a round. GG ST has burst, Netherealm's games have breakers etc. Tekken has nothing.
        Did you even think about your comment before posting it lol? 

Imagine if there was a gun in counterstrike that instantly killed you and then you literally didn’t get to play at all for up to almost 2 entire minutes in some cases. Oh wait, that’s all of them. Please explain how taking a combo for 10 seconds is less interactive than literally just being a spectator for minutes at a time
            You clearly have never played CS in your life and I appologise for assuming that you did. I should have used Forknife as an example for someone who is seriously comparing guns in FPS to getting stunlocked in FGs. I should have never tried to explain shit to you, but know this:

your take is bad and you should feel bad
                You sound obnoxious lol stop sniffing your own farts
                    I sniff whatever the fk I want 😎💨
                you sound comically stupid. Keep crying about the fighting in your fighting game tho
                    Lmaooo he got so mad. That's how you know you gotem
                    Go touch some grass my dude, give your remaining braincell a rest. Maybe then you'll finally realize how dumb your argument is.
                Bro literally described every FPS with an objective game mode
But it’s not a problem. It’s always been like that. You calling it a problem and adding an emoji changes nothing. You’re just garbage at the game
    "Its not a problem, because it's always been like this" is not a very compelling argument.

For example shitty netcode has "always been like this" but I see nobody who wouldn't want a better one. This is just an example out of a left field, but I hope I got my point across.

>!sucker!<😎
Rage Arts should be the length of Heat Smashes. They're the most useless part of the game, even casuals like me get bored of them
Stay alert for dropped combos.
I grew to not let it get to me as well. 

Like "okay so knowing this player they gonna try to spam the shoulder attack" and hopefully guess right and retaliate.
10 seconds is a lot when the timer is 60 seconds
Lmao top strat
DBS Broly combos💀
[deleted]
    I do think they’re long as well but this guy is right about some of the 2D games, touch of death is a thing
When TOD is a common lingo among the players
Many people don't like it would prefer shorter combos or breakers or something. It is ok to talk about what you don't like a bout a game
Tekken's Rage Art length has been pretty much the same since what, Tekken 7? That shit came out in 2015,  there's been damn near a decade of Tekken Rage Arts being Tekken Rage Arts
you need to block then
Yeah or even MK1…knew I was gonna bounce off that game when I saw the same dialed-in combos that last for deadass 15 seconds while the opponent does reset after reset
    MK has combo breakers
Mashing 1/3 in the off chance that they'll drop the combo. Good times.
This might be a problem I have. What am I supposed to do while being combo’d? Hold back to try and block, do nothing at all, do something else? Genuine question
    Air launched? Tech Roll. 99% of the time you can tech roll. You should be spamming 1 and 2 or 3 and 4 to roll out of bad combo tightness or just roll out when it finishes.
Combo execution in Tekken has never been difficult, that goes back to older Tekkens as well, not just 8.

The difficulty in Tekken it's having 100 different moves per character, and once you reach high level, you have to learn many of those moves for different matches-up.
The game's combo philosophy is pretty straightforward. Reward players for their risk. It's one of the reasons why people would complain about Steve's b1 as before you could basically wiff it and recover before any punishment can be dealt. Now it's just a Tk7 magic 4.

As for optimal damage you can always position yourself to reduce the damage. I'll sometimes purposefully fight with my shoulder to a wall to reduce movement options and as the old saying goes "sidewall saves lives". This usually is why people advocate for feild obstacles to prevent constant juggle combos but those create other problems if not handled well.

Throws you kind of just have to treat them like forward throws and they all have homing properties to make up for hiw easy they can be to break.
    I think the main issue for some players isn't the damage of a combo, it's how long it goes on for making it very boring. Sure it gives more time for them to mess up and drop the combo, but it's not like it's hard to not drop a combo you've practiced enough.
        I think combos go on for longer in Marvel and anime fighters tbh.
Im not sure if this will be a unpopular opinion but to me Tekken isn't technically hard like Street Fighter or other 2d fighters. However, the knowledge requirement is significantly higher than 2d fighters. Thats why I do not understand the special style addition outside of consistently hit frame perfects with select characters I don't find any inputs difficult, it's probably the easiest fighting game to start but quickly requires matchup knowledge to advance in skill.
    Yep, pretty much, Street Fighter is about execution, the higher the level of competition, the tighter the execution, and faster reaction time will be required.

Difficulty in Tekken is about knowledge checks, to know what's the opponent gonna do, especially at high level.

Yeah, I don't think special style was needed in Tekken at all, but then I understand that Namco was trying to pull even more casuals than the usual (Tekken already pulls a lot of casuals).
clearly you've never seen lee combos. the amount of execution to pull off an optimal lee combo is insane and the damage it does does not reflect the effort.
    This was true in t7, now in t8 lee is one of the characters with higher damage potential becuase of his new wallcombo spike
        Eh, it's still kinda weird to do MSS cancels to get a combo that deals more than 60 damage. I'd say Nina's a better example of a character who got their combos "dumbed down".
            i dont think lee's combos got dumbed down, but the idea that he has to work hard for low damage is no longer true
    It's so frustrating, especially when going up against high damage dealers like paul, dragonov, king, etc. When the opponent gets a free 50+ dmg combo off heat smash, Just makes you want to throw the controller
    Lee's combos are not THAT much harder compared to other characters. Especially in T8.
And that's true. High damage combos in any King Of Fighters are difficult to execute '
Speak for yourself, I am constantly whiffing combos in a panic. If I can actually get any launchers out that is.
Green ranks do it too. Some players literally throw out 0 jabs or strings, they just try to launch and then do their 100 damage combo over and over. They're easy to beat but it's just like there's no way they are getting better at the game not even attempting to learn any mechanics other than their extremely long combo.
Ehh, try learning to do some of Steves optimal combos consistently. Some characters just have harder execution.

Some examples:

Counterhit b1~FLK > EXT DCK 1 > df+1,2~1~FLK~DCK~iWS 1 > f+2,2 > LNH 2 T! > dash LWV 1,2 > DCK 1	

PAB df+2 > PAB f+1+2 > f+2,1~FLK~DCK~iWS+2,2 > LNH 2 T! LWV 1,2 > LNH 2
Hold up, you expect players to try thinking about why they're getting hit?
Even at the highest rank people get launched all the time, it's not like you can avoid it
    They still take the time to think though, instead of getting annoyed that combos exist.
You act like I even played MK1
    Didn't say mk 1 any 2d mk is the same
[deleted]
    Ah yes. cr.MK into full combo: the game. 

The game would probably be more footsies centric in theory, but drive rush from neutral and confirming into drive rush for combos make it far less “pokey” than Tekken. I think tekkens pressure game is far more oppressive, especially with heat, but getting in to start that pressure from neutral is much harder than SF6.
Just win the game it's that simple
    Real
What are you taking about
It’s a core part of tekkens identity, it wouldn’t be tekken without it. High damage combos been in the games since tekken 1, and they’ve been long since tekken 6 about 15 years ago. It’s a punishment for your mistakes.

It’s weirder that you have a post saying to nerf juggles tbh
    No they're not, stop lying with this "wouldn't be tekken without it" crap, you already admitted it took 6 enteries before this ridiculous combo time became a factor, so happens tekken 5 is ALOT of people's favorites

Nobody's asking for juggles to do less damage, yes high damage combo's are good 👍 but nobody wants to sit through an ad every launch while the other guy blast his control for 30 seconds, i get its fun to pull off, you can argue that you enjoy it, and hell i sometimes enjoy it too, but the annoyance for those on the receiving end aswell as viewers is way too big of a con to justify it in my opinion

If you wanna combo, go play devil may cry, but this is a multiplayer game, there's more to be considered here, then your strawman'd argument of "oh well you just dont wanna get punished for your mistakes"

I'd even argue shorter combos are way more sadisfying to pull off, you get those big chunks from big chunky hits, slam the opponent into the ground, they go flying, and back to business
        > I'd even argue shorter combos are way more sadisfying to pull off, you get those big chunks from big chunky hits, slam the opponent into the ground, they go flying, and back to business

This is why I main Paul.
            Same for bryan, i know bryan has long combo's, but i dont use em, cuz i can get pretty big damage without em, and just punching the shit out of everyone is always more fun then whatever optimal bullshit i could dedicate 2 hours in the lab to learning, like they never even look cool, whats the point?

Also funny im getting downvotes, when im flat out saying its my opinion and that both sides has pros and cons (even if i do believe my opinion has a stronger basis to stand on) classic tekken community i guess 🤣
    Core part of tekken, that has becomes bigger each release to the point where its just too much. Give me tekken 5 level juggles
        70% off of a df2 without walls incoming
        Yes thank you. It should go back to tekken 5 levels of juggle, the good days like mvc2
    No it just came in tekken 6, idk when it was decided that it was a core part of Tekkens identity lol
        Juggles or air combos have always been a part of the games. Bounds, screws/T-spins, pick-ups, and the 54 other combo extenders came with 6. People seem to be conflating the two and arguing about nothing.
            The long juggles was not a thing until 6
    And even more weird you snooped on my profile in an attempt to over defend juggles lol yall r funny
    I’ve always thought there should be a cap on natural combos without wall breaks. Heat should extend it by one small segment but I have always felt 80+ damage makes it unfair as certain characters can do it easily while others take crazy execution. The reward for a 15f launcher should be more uniform across characters imo.
i legitimately don’t understand why juggles need “defending.” have any of you ever played a fighting game before? T8 juggles are nothing compared to most games lol
    Name a few
        get hit a single time in DBFZ, MK1 and MKX, literally every Marvel game and you are watching a one minute cutscene. T8 is so much faster paced than most fighting games, this is such a crazy take lol
            Dbfz is accurate, MK GAMES HAVE COMBO BREAKERS, and Marvel vs capcom juggles are more balanced, shorter, and way harder to pull off.
                that you think MARVEL of all games is more balanced than T8 tells me all i need to know. genuinely only something you could possibly say if you have literally never seen any Marvel be played lmao
                    Not the game, just the juggles. Also again aerial combos are much harder to pull off, everyone’s dishing out Tekken juggles even in the low ranks.
        To add on what other people have said about other games having much longer combos (DBFZ and MvC particularly), it's worth noting that Tekken in general is extremely fast. So much so, that the standard of play is 3 rounds instead of 2 rounds like almost every other game. That's another big evidence as for why juggles in Tekken aren't as long as you think they are. Yeah they may do a lot of damage, but at least they're quick.
Honestly Tekken is great, but doesn't have the most beautiful combos. Almost all combos seem to be juggles.
    In my opinion they went overboard on the juggles
It's a core aspect of the whole game, if you don't like juggles why even play Tekken
    Tekken has a lot of good things that are unique to it that aren't juggles. Arguably one of Tekken's stronger points is that the core gameplay is closer to the logic of real martial arts (bears and robots aside), and the extended DDR solitaire sequences - excuse me, juggles - are the aberration.
        Right
    It’s not the core aspect lol and like I always say nobody said get rid of juggles completely, nerf it so people like yall don’t think the game is ONLY about juggles.”core aspect”..every fighting game has juggles but notice how it’s not a core aspect
        There’s a big difference between being ‘A’ core aspect and ‘THE’ core aspect. Please learn reading comprehension before discussing.
            “If you don’t like juggles why even play tekken” the way you and everyone else defending tekken juggles like it’s your mom, I’d say you meant “the” core aspect lol
Why play fighting games if you don’t like doing combos lol
    endless juggles are just boring, just get that damage in and all good, it's not that hard to press those buttons, you and your opponent just get bored to death especialy after landing two walls in a row lol

and it's not like every fighting game consists of endless juggling haha
Dude these replies are killing me lmao. It’s not like this is dbfz or something
    I could legitimately go to the bathroom and come back before a DBFZ combo ends. Trash design lol
    DBFz wishes it had walls AND floors to break to extend combos ! 

Last match, I could run to the door, get the pizzas, come back, and the juggle was not done !?. 

Thank you Tekken for letting me get pizzas at the door mid-match ! 

Top tier game ! 

I hope watching Netflix becomes close to viable during T9's matches, that would really be great !!
        You’re not seriously implying dbfz has shorter combos than t8 are you? 😂
Solution to losing? Just win, bro
    Fax
You get launched, everyone gets launched, no one doesn’t get launched
    you can pretty easily limit how often you get launched in tekken though. If you just stop pressing attack buttons it helps a lot.
        Ohh is that all lol
        Who needs attack buttons? Guess ill win by walking only then
    That solution is only for OP due to his "complaints"
Gotta take risks to get damage in, and sometimes you'll just get launched. Part of the game and it's wonderful
Kind of missing the point that even the best players will spend a lot of time being combo'd. Just part of the game.
    I was watching devilster set vs atif butt's Kazuya, and half of it was like a combo video, it must have been infuriating 
    yeah but he’s new, so it’s not relevant. he won’t be one of the best for years. he’s getting combo’s way more.
Many people don't like combos that long. Maybe the devs should consider toning them down?
    That's literally never going to happen.
Combos have been long for a while now lol.
    With heat stuff it's even longer
        You saying Tag 2 era combos were shorter?
            I played both and they were shorter, most of them anyway especially when you compare wall to wall
Lol cope
Is it still active?
This sounds cool
Combo breakers would not really work in Tekken.

The moves are balanced around them being able to be punished heavily. Combo breakers would break the game since people would just throw out the riskiest shit and they wouldn't get punished as hard if they can just undo their unga bunga easily.
Fellow Law main, don’t do this
Almost all neutral launchers can be jab punished. Always makes them walk back a few steps holding block after they realize this launcher spam bs isnt gonna work.
    A lot of df2 launchers are -7. Those which are do not launch crouching targets.
        Really? In my experience almost all df2s hit mid, but you’re saying they hit high or what? Odd, thanks for the info
            They will hit crouchers but not launch usually unless its a counter hit, yoshis df2 works this way for instance. df2's that hit crouch and launch without CH are usually punishable
                You’re so right, I always hopkick crouching targets but I guess idk… basically I never rlly noticed and was doing it by instinct, and uf3(yoshi hopkick) and df2 are so similar in my mind I thought they were the same move almost.
            Can’t say for sure but I assume one’s that hit mid, but won’t give a full combo on hit, just based off the wording.
                ? I’m not rlly sure what you’re trying to say. But DF2 and UF3/4 are ‘universal’ launchers and almost always hit mid don’t they? It’s why ducking against a king can be so dangerous because his hopkick hits mid and will launch you, same with df2. Maybe i’m missing something

Edit: i have no idea why I thought this,  I’m just so used to hopkick and df2 being practically the same move in my mind
                    I know Jins df2 doesn’t launch on hit, so. I could probably test and get back to you on that, but I assume the guy is talking about stuff like that.
                        Yeah I made an edit, I just instinctively have always hopkicked crouching targets, df2 and hopkick being so similar in framedata and launch angle… I was incorrectly remembering launching people with it despite actually hopkicking them lol.
                            Yea, it’s more of an exception to a rule type of thing. df2 is -9, no launch, but can cancel into crouch dash. 

uf4 is the standard -13 that everyone (but Jun) *should* have. 

Another one is Bryan, who’s df2 doesn’t launch, but uses fb2. Which is actually -7 even with a launch property.
            he's saying some df2 lauchers are safe on block and the ones that are do hit crouching opponents but it doesn't actually launch them for a combo like the unsafe df2's do which are usually -12/-14. Reina is an exception with her df2 being -12 AND doesn't launch crouching opponents.
            Some like Asuka’s DF2 will hit people crouching but won’t launch them unless on its counter hit
                Speaking of which Asuka has 4 launchers that doesn't have to be counters. 3 that hit mid/crouching opponents and 1 high.

By the way, how do you get the name of your mains under your username?
                    Go to the main page for the sub, hit the dots in the top right, change user flair, pick whichever you want. They don’t have Victor so I went with my next best character
                        Thanks!
                    Are we talking safe or all? DF2, B3, 1+2, F2 for mid and F4 for high, right?
                        English please.
                            Well, these are the Tekken notations, U(p), D(own), B(ack), F(orward), so DF is down-forward input. 1-left arm, 2 right arm, 3 left leg, 4 right leg.

So DF2 is down+forward+2 (her mid safe launcher)
F2 is her tooth fairy, long range unsafe high launch
B3 is her backflip, that is technically unsafe, hard to punish though
1+2 is her squeeze move that is perfectly safe (-9frames) with fastest offensive move (sorry Yoshi) being 10 frames.

F4 is plus on block homing high, that leads to a specific combo route.
    I love launcher spammers. Makes d/f+1 setplay so much more satisfying.
I have to respect my opponents who throw out launchers at every opportunity. I'd never have to guts to do so.
    What are launchers? 🚀
Some ppl give me the confidence to do whatever i want. Sometimes it works
WANING MOON BABY!!!
That throw is also one of my to go because it require 1 + 2 to break it 🤣
Wdym??? Someone ls gatekeeping because they’re using combos? Just play offline or in a casual lobby then
    I have an 85 win rate in ranked ima mighty ruler. You know exactly what I mean by gatekeeping. Fake tryhsrds purposely staying at a certain rank to stop anyone from ranking up
        I unfortunately don’t know. I also dont know what that has to do with getting hit by a launcher
        It’s not me staying at a rank on purpose trying to get everyone to Garyu then mighty ruler. I’m like 33 percent there.
You bought a fighting game expecting people not to fight? That's kinda wild. lol.
    You're purposely acting dumb as if you don't know exactly what I'm saying.
I main Dragunov and I don't like doing Rage arts because they take so long. Bryan's too.
    Dragunov’s also just sucks. It gets cold and…he does an awkward hammer fist? I get what they were going for but it doesn’t look powerful and it’s lame on top of that.
        It's cold, simple, effective, and needs no words.  Like Dragunov.
            I just wish it somehow involved him crawling around as that intro is one of my favorites. Dragunov looks so mad that his sneaking was interrupted.
            But why does he suddenly have ice powers.
                He doesn’t have ice powers, he has teleportation so he can beat your ass in siberia
                    That makes more sense actually.
        At least it's not like Shaheen's lol
            What's wrong with surfing on the dude?
                "I respect you as a fighter" - *surfs to the mall on the opponent's face*
        It kinda feels like a less thematically effective version of his T7 rage art.
        The frost effect isn't even a result of Dragunov having ice powers either, it's just a weird location change to the Arctic Snowfall stage in T7. At least when Devil Jin does a location change he laser swords you, or when Zafina does it, Azazel's arm reaches out to crush you.
I wish there was an "opt-out" for rage art cinematography and if both players have it checked, it just fades out and back in, and game on.
    I wish there was an opt-out for rage arts altogether…
My fps goes down 40 with dragunov's rage art
Word, I love when fighting games are cinematic.
Is his longer than average? They all feel long af to me.
TAKIN IT LIKE A CHAMP
Negan kept bringing the worst episode of TWD back from the dead for years. Really rubbed the salt in the wound.
    It’s the best episode though. It’s brutal and unnerving, but that was the whole point and true to the source material. They executed it very well
You could try not getting launched
    I just meant to keep the gameplay more active even if you do get launched. 75% isn’t bad, it’s like 2 hits off most chains.
lol double capos, double bobs, double changs, double Lili, there was some really crazy teams in that game. But I won’t lie, I do miss it, probably the most fun I’ve had in Tekken.
It doesn't take much skill at all not to drop most combos after you properly learn them.

King's throws give you a chance to break them so you have to catch them standing like using a low, but then on top of that king needs to mix up the throw so they don't break it. That's 2 interactions, not one. 

His longer chain throws I assume you're complaining about when you say 15 seconds give you multiple escapes as well making them require even more correct interactions.

He's not hated over "not letting you play the game" he's hated because people often can't properly break throws already, and he has some of the most powerful and ambiguous ones to break in the game. He also has the most throws to learn how to break out of any character putting tons of homework on the opponent. The universal throw buffs in 8 that strongly benefit him on top of all the usual things that make people hate King aren't helping either.
    Actaully King 2 would be the strongest King. You're fighting a severely nerfed King compared to King in T1 and T2. He would be literally banned from tournaments had they kept him the same.
The throws can be broken, so if you're locked for "5-15" seconds that's on you. 

When he goes for a throw he exposes himself just as much as if you had thrown out a launcher. Only difference is you can't break a combo, but you can break a throw. 

Imagine you hit EWGF and the opponent doesn't get launched and they take 0 damage. That's essentially what King has to go through multiple times a match.
    Absurd comparison. His throw is eleven frames and you both reset at the same time. It’s much, much closer to a jab than a launcher. Except it does a ton more damage.
        How is the comparison absurd? It's more similar than you realize. I'll demonstrate with EWGF:

Technically EWGF is also eleven frames out of crouch dash, and even puts you at +5 or 6 on block. King's puts you at 0 when you break it, just like you said.

Both EWGF and King's throws can be ducked and punished, minus a few rare exceptions.

Also "it does a ton more damage" - only if you mess up like 3 times in a row, not including avoiding the initial throw. And it could also do 0 damage even if you successfully land the initial grab.
            Except it takes at least 14 frames, because the cd will take 3. Even more absurd. King also has throws specifically to use against ducked characters. It does more damage compared to a jab! Jesus you’re disingenuous, too!
                EWGF also has mid variants. Devil Kazuya's normal EWGF, Jin's AOS awakened god fist, etc.

"Except it takes at least 14 frames" 

1 - I said it was 11 OUT OF cd.

2 - Both Reina and Kazuya can do PEWGF, which is quicker than i14.

Like I said earlier, if you get half your life gone from a chain throw, that's your fault. 

You have at least 3 different chances to break the chain minimum, not counting the initial starting grab. 

Also grabs have way less reach than most launchers, longer recovery, and can be broken to take 0 damage.

TLDR: diagnosis: skill issue.
    The throws can be broken, so if you're locked for "5-15" seconds that's on you. 

* Care to explain in detail how to break those then? Those are hard to break. You sound like you've done this countless times before, what better way than to learn from someone with experience.
        Yeah so what I like to do is get hit by a throw and then hop in my time machine to right before I get thrown and try again until it works.

Hope this helps.

But if you want a complete answer just press 1 for right hand 2 for left 1+2 for both.

            Did you down vote my comment?
                I generally downvote AI peddlers, yes
It's straight up the opposite. When I grab someone as King, unless it's an anti-crouch grab or something, I almost expect it to be escaped against decent people. This resets to neutral AND denies damage. In high levels of play this straight up undoes everything I did to get in.

On the flipside... Some arguably more frail human than King can flail their wrist or ankles around and keep me airborne or bouncing for the same or more of my healthbar with absolutely NO possibility for an escape. It can also be the same combo, too! Yet with King I also have to mix up throws that just get escaped.

Honestly though I like the challenge... and I find King to be the most fun and interesting character to play with.
You can only floor break once in a combo, if you're floor broken twice you ate two combos. And descent into madness requires 3 floor breaks to hit the desert at the bottom - so that's three combos since the first floor requires a hard break (2 ground hits) to actually break.
    it only has 2 floor breaks.
        When the floor is normal you need to floor break once to cause lightning to strike and turn it purple. This will automatically happen during climax if it has not already occurred (rare, usually people will take advantage of these floor breaks for combo extensions as floor breaking is the easiest combo extension in the game as it doesn't have a positional requirement like wall breaks). 

There are two kinds of breaks, hard and regular.

Hard breaks require two hits that need to be done in two separate combos. 

Descent into subconscious is a hard floor break (the only one). Into the stratosphere has a floor bounce that functions the same as a floor break that activates in climax. 

Shrine and Estate both have a hard wall break that require hitting the same wall twice. Hitting it the first time will 'damage' the wall (the bricks that make up the wall in shrine will partially fall out, the glass wall in estate will spiderweb and bend) and the second will cause a break.
Yep, I'm not a massive fan of combo heavy games and prefer shorter more realistic combos but it's the way fighting games are going and we either quit or deal with it
    Virtua Fighter says hello 👋
        I really miss VF. I used to play in ever tournament available by train 😂 the combos in VF5 got longer and higher damage though

Soul Calibur is what I like though. The combos are normally on 2-3 hits and you have air control to get out of longer combos
            That reversal edge though… 😬 they need to put SoulCalibur 2 HD on modern consoles. 
                Yeah, SC2 was the last great SC game. I miss it so much, still play it sometimes on Dolphin
                    They did have an online one in HD on ps3 and 360. The 360 one is playable on Series X/S. No Link though 😆
        DOA with the hold system 

Also we have VF characters lmao
            I seriously considered just getting back into DOA 5/6 after playing Tekken 8 for 70 hours 😂
        lowjab, lowjab,lowjab,lowjab
        I haven't played them, but I pray for VF6 coming out on steam
    > but it's the way fighting games are going

Was this comment made in 1994?
        Haha 😂 you certainly had combos back in the 90s. Especially on 2D fighters. However they have got progressively longer. Look at some older Tekken games, Tekken 4 had basically no juggles, Tekken 5 had a combo system but was limited, certain characters had wall travel and wall damage but most didn't (which is cool BTW and actually makes characters unique) tekken 6 was an odd game, it was less combo centric but the bound system made combos crazy. TTT2 WE DON'T TALK ABOUT!

Then Tekken 7 came along. Every character has long combos that do the same thing and everyone can go from wall to wall and deal 100 damage (bar very few characters)
People here have no idea the bullshittery of UMVC3. There are teams in that game that lead to a 300% true combo that cannot be escaped. If you get touched once, you genuinely lose the entire round unless the opponent messes up their unblockable setup.
    Kusoge
Lol I'm very new to this subreddit and I thought you were talking about some launching moves with those abbreviations. 
Exactly. Also you get the buzz when you combo them
Imagine there was a gun in counter strike that froze you in place for 10 seconds, while dealing consistent damage to roughly equate to 40% of your max HP. I wander why they dont do that, huh? (WC3 mod excluded)

Many other fighting games have at least one system that allows you to attempt to "break" the combos once a round. GG ST has burst, Netherealm's games have breakers etc. Tekken has nothing.
    Did you even think about your comment before posting it lol? 

Imagine if there was a gun in counterstrike that instantly killed you and then you literally didn’t get to play at all for up to almost 2 entire minutes in some cases. Oh wait, that’s all of them. Please explain how taking a combo for 10 seconds is less interactive than literally just being a spectator for minutes at a time
        You clearly have never played CS in your life and I appologise for assuming that you did. I should have used Forknife as an example for someone who is seriously comparing guns in FPS to getting stunlocked in FGs. I should have never tried to explain shit to you, but know this:

your take is bad and you should feel bad
            You sound obnoxious lol stop sniffing your own farts
                I sniff whatever the fk I want 😎💨
            you sound comically stupid. Keep crying about the fighting in your fighting game tho
                Lmaooo he got so mad. That's how you know you gotem
                Go touch some grass my dude, give your remaining braincell a rest. Maybe then you'll finally realize how dumb your argument is.
            Bro literally described every FPS with an objective game mode
"Its not a problem, because it's always been like this" is not a very compelling argument.

For example shitty netcode has "always been like this" but I see nobody who wouldn't want a better one. This is just an example out of a left field, but I hope I got my point across.

>!sucker!<😎
I do think they’re long as well but this guy is right about some of the 2D games, touch of death is a thing
MK has combo breakers
Air launched? Tech Roll. 99% of the time you can tech roll. You should be spamming 1 and 2 or 3 and 4 to roll out of bad combo tightness or just roll out when it finishes.
I think the main issue for some players isn't the damage of a combo, it's how long it goes on for making it very boring. Sure it gives more time for them to mess up and drop the combo, but it's not like it's hard to not drop a combo you've practiced enough.
    I think combos go on for longer in Marvel and anime fighters tbh.
Yep, pretty much, Street Fighter is about execution, the higher the level of competition, the tighter the execution, and faster reaction time will be required.

Difficulty in Tekken is about knowledge checks, to know what's the opponent gonna do, especially at high level.

Yeah, I don't think special style was needed in Tekken at all, but then I understand that Namco was trying to pull even more casuals than the usual (Tekken already pulls a lot of casuals).
This was true in t7, now in t8 lee is one of the characters with higher damage potential becuase of his new wallcombo spike
    Eh, it's still kinda weird to do MSS cancels to get a combo that deals more than 60 damage. I'd say Nina's a better example of a character who got their combos "dumbed down".
        i dont think lee's combos got dumbed down, but the idea that he has to work hard for low damage is no longer true
It's so frustrating, especially when going up against high damage dealers like paul, dragonov, king, etc. When the opponent gets a free 50+ dmg combo off heat smash, Just makes you want to throw the controller
Lee's combos are not THAT much harder compared to other characters. Especially in T8.
They still take the time to think though, instead of getting annoyed that combos exist.
Didn't say mk 1 any 2d mk is the same
Ah yes. cr.MK into full combo: the game. 

The game would probably be more footsies centric in theory, but drive rush from neutral and confirming into drive rush for combos make it far less “pokey” than Tekken. I think tekkens pressure game is far more oppressive, especially with heat, but getting in to start that pressure from neutral is much harder than SF6.
Real
No they're not, stop lying with this "wouldn't be tekken without it" crap, you already admitted it took 6 enteries before this ridiculous combo time became a factor, so happens tekken 5 is ALOT of people's favorites

Nobody's asking for juggles to do less damage, yes high damage combo's are good 👍 but nobody wants to sit through an ad every launch while the other guy blast his control for 30 seconds, i get its fun to pull off, you can argue that you enjoy it, and hell i sometimes enjoy it too, but the annoyance for those on the receiving end aswell as viewers is way too big of a con to justify it in my opinion

If you wanna combo, go play devil may cry, but this is a multiplayer game, there's more to be considered here, then your strawman'd argument of "oh well you just dont wanna get punished for your mistakes"

I'd even argue shorter combos are way more sadisfying to pull off, you get those big chunks from big chunky hits, slam the opponent into the ground, they go flying, and back to business
    > I'd even argue shorter combos are way more sadisfying to pull off, you get those big chunks from big chunky hits, slam the opponent into the ground, they go flying, and back to business

This is why I main Paul.
        Same for bryan, i know bryan has long combo's, but i dont use em, cuz i can get pretty big damage without em, and just punching the shit out of everyone is always more fun then whatever optimal bullshit i could dedicate 2 hours in the lab to learning, like they never even look cool, whats the point?

Also funny im getting downvotes, when im flat out saying its my opinion and that both sides has pros and cons (even if i do believe my opinion has a stronger basis to stand on) classic tekken community i guess 🤣
Core part of tekken, that has becomes bigger each release to the point where its just too much. Give me tekken 5 level juggles
    70% off of a df2 without walls incoming
    Yes thank you. It should go back to tekken 5 levels of juggle, the good days like mvc2
No it just came in tekken 6, idk when it was decided that it was a core part of Tekkens identity lol
    Juggles or air combos have always been a part of the games. Bounds, screws/T-spins, pick-ups, and the 54 other combo extenders came with 6. People seem to be conflating the two and arguing about nothing.
        The long juggles was not a thing until 6
And even more weird you snooped on my profile in an attempt to over defend juggles lol yall r funny
I’ve always thought there should be a cap on natural combos without wall breaks. Heat should extend it by one small segment but I have always felt 80+ damage makes it unfair as certain characters can do it easily while others take crazy execution. The reward for a 15f launcher should be more uniform across characters imo.
Name a few
    get hit a single time in DBFZ, MK1 and MKX, literally every Marvel game and you are watching a one minute cutscene. T8 is so much faster paced than most fighting games, this is such a crazy take lol
        Dbfz is accurate, MK GAMES HAVE COMBO BREAKERS, and Marvel vs capcom juggles are more balanced, shorter, and way harder to pull off.
            that you think MARVEL of all games is more balanced than T8 tells me all i need to know. genuinely only something you could possibly say if you have literally never seen any Marvel be played lmao
                Not the game, just the juggles. Also again aerial combos are much harder to pull off, everyone’s dishing out Tekken juggles even in the low ranks.
    To add on what other people have said about other games having much longer combos (DBFZ and MvC particularly), it's worth noting that Tekken in general is extremely fast. So much so, that the standard of play is 3 rounds instead of 2 rounds like almost every other game. That's another big evidence as for why juggles in Tekken aren't as long as you think they are. Yeah they may do a lot of damage, but at least they're quick.
In my opinion they went overboard on the juggles
Tekken has a lot of good things that are unique to it that aren't juggles. Arguably one of Tekken's stronger points is that the core gameplay is closer to the logic of real martial arts (bears and robots aside), and the extended DDR solitaire sequences - excuse me, juggles - are the aberration.
    Right
It’s not the core aspect lol and like I always say nobody said get rid of juggles completely, nerf it so people like yall don’t think the game is ONLY about juggles.”core aspect”..every fighting game has juggles but notice how it’s not a core aspect
    There’s a big difference between being ‘A’ core aspect and ‘THE’ core aspect. Please learn reading comprehension before discussing.
        “If you don’t like juggles why even play tekken” the way you and everyone else defending tekken juggles like it’s your mom, I’d say you meant “the” core aspect lol
endless juggles are just boring, just get that damage in and all good, it's not that hard to press those buttons, you and your opponent just get bored to death especialy after landing two walls in a row lol

and it's not like every fighting game consists of endless juggling haha
I could legitimately go to the bathroom and come back before a DBFZ combo ends. Trash design lol
DBFz wishes it had walls AND floors to break to extend combos ! 

Last match, I could run to the door, get the pizzas, come back, and the juggle was not done !?. 

Thank you Tekken for letting me get pizzas at the door mid-match ! 

Top tier game ! 

I hope watching Netflix becomes close to viable during T9's matches, that would really be great !!
    You’re not seriously implying dbfz has shorter combos than t8 are you? 😂
Fax
you can pretty easily limit how often you get launched in tekken though. If you just stop pressing attack buttons it helps a lot.
    Ohh is that all lol
    Who needs attack buttons? Guess ill win by walking only then
That solution is only for OP due to his "complaints"
I was watching devilster set vs atif butt's Kazuya, and half of it was like a combo video, it must have been infuriating 
yeah but he’s new, so it’s not relevant. he won’t be one of the best for years. he’s getting combo’s way more.
That's literally never going to happen.
With heat stuff it's even longer
    You saying Tag 2 era combos were shorter?
        I played both and they were shorter, most of them anyway especially when you compare wall to wall
A lot of df2 launchers are -7. Those which are do not launch crouching targets.
    Really? In my experience almost all df2s hit mid, but you’re saying they hit high or what? Odd, thanks for the info
        They will hit crouchers but not launch usually unless its a counter hit, yoshis df2 works this way for instance. df2's that hit crouch and launch without CH are usually punishable
            You’re so right, I always hopkick crouching targets but I guess idk… basically I never rlly noticed and was doing it by instinct, and uf3(yoshi hopkick) and df2 are so similar in my mind I thought they were the same move almost.
        Can’t say for sure but I assume one’s that hit mid, but won’t give a full combo on hit, just based off the wording.
            ? I’m not rlly sure what you’re trying to say. But DF2 and UF3/4 are ‘universal’ launchers and almost always hit mid don’t they? It’s why ducking against a king can be so dangerous because his hopkick hits mid and will launch you, same with df2. Maybe i’m missing something

Edit: i have no idea why I thought this,  I’m just so used to hopkick and df2 being practically the same move in my mind
                I know Jins df2 doesn’t launch on hit, so. I could probably test and get back to you on that, but I assume the guy is talking about stuff like that.
                    Yeah I made an edit, I just instinctively have always hopkicked crouching targets, df2 and hopkick being so similar in framedata and launch angle… I was incorrectly remembering launching people with it despite actually hopkicking them lol.
                        Yea, it’s more of an exception to a rule type of thing. df2 is -9, no launch, but can cancel into crouch dash. 

uf4 is the standard -13 that everyone (but Jun) *should* have. 

Another one is Bryan, who’s df2 doesn’t launch, but uses fb2. Which is actually -7 even with a launch property.
        he's saying some df2 lauchers are safe on block and the ones that are do hit crouching opponents but it doesn't actually launch them for a combo like the unsafe df2's do which are usually -12/-14. Reina is an exception with her df2 being -12 AND doesn't launch crouching opponents.
        Some like Asuka’s DF2 will hit people crouching but won’t launch them unless on its counter hit
            Speaking of which Asuka has 4 launchers that doesn't have to be counters. 3 that hit mid/crouching opponents and 1 high.

By the way, how do you get the name of your mains under your username?
                Go to the main page for the sub, hit the dots in the top right, change user flair, pick whichever you want. They don’t have Victor so I went with my next best character
                    Thanks!
                Are we talking safe or all? DF2, B3, 1+2, F2 for mid and F4 for high, right?
                    English please.
                        Well, these are the Tekken notations, U(p), D(own), B(ack), F(orward), so DF is down-forward input. 1-left arm, 2 right arm, 3 left leg, 4 right leg.

So DF2 is down+forward+2 (her mid safe launcher)
F2 is her tooth fairy, long range unsafe high launch
B3 is her backflip, that is technically unsafe, hard to punish though
1+2 is her squeeze move that is perfectly safe (-9frames) with fastest offensive move (sorry Yoshi) being 10 frames.

F4 is plus on block homing high, that leads to a specific combo route.
I love launcher spammers. Makes d/f+1 setplay so much more satisfying.
What are launchers? 🚀
I have an 85 win rate in ranked ima mighty ruler. You know exactly what I mean by gatekeeping. Fake tryhsrds purposely staying at a certain rank to stop anyone from ranking up
    I unfortunately don’t know. I also dont know what that has to do with getting hit by a launcher
    It’s not me staying at a rank on purpose trying to get everyone to Garyu then mighty ruler. I’m like 33 percent there.
You're purposely acting dumb as if you don't know exactly what I'm saying.
Dragunov’s also just sucks. It gets cold and…he does an awkward hammer fist? I get what they were going for but it doesn’t look powerful and it’s lame on top of that.
    It's cold, simple, effective, and needs no words.  Like Dragunov.
        I just wish it somehow involved him crawling around as that intro is one of my favorites. Dragunov looks so mad that his sneaking was interrupted.
        But why does he suddenly have ice powers.
            He doesn’t have ice powers, he has teleportation so he can beat your ass in siberia
                That makes more sense actually.
    At least it's not like Shaheen's lol
        What's wrong with surfing on the dude?
            "I respect you as a fighter" - *surfs to the mall on the opponent's face*
    It kinda feels like a less thematically effective version of his T7 rage art.
    The frost effect isn't even a result of Dragunov having ice powers either, it's just a weird location change to the Arctic Snowfall stage in T7. At least when Devil Jin does a location change he laser swords you, or when Zafina does it, Azazel's arm reaches out to crush you.
I wish there was an opt-out for rage arts altogether…
It’s the best episode though. It’s brutal and unnerving, but that was the whole point and true to the source material. They executed it very well
I just meant to keep the gameplay more active even if you do get launched. 75% isn’t bad, it’s like 2 hits off most chains.
Actaully King 2 would be the strongest King. You're fighting a severely nerfed King compared to King in T1 and T2. He would be literally banned from tournaments had they kept him the same.
Absurd comparison. His throw is eleven frames and you both reset at the same time. It’s much, much closer to a jab than a launcher. Except it does a ton more damage.
    How is the comparison absurd? It's more similar than you realize. I'll demonstrate with EWGF:

Technically EWGF is also eleven frames out of crouch dash, and even puts you at +5 or 6 on block. King's puts you at 0 when you break it, just like you said.

Both EWGF and King's throws can be ducked and punished, minus a few rare exceptions.

Also "it does a ton more damage" - only if you mess up like 3 times in a row, not including avoiding the initial throw. And it could also do 0 damage even if you successfully land the initial grab.
        Except it takes at least 14 frames, because the cd will take 3. Even more absurd. King also has throws specifically to use against ducked characters. It does more damage compared to a jab! Jesus you’re disingenuous, too!
            EWGF also has mid variants. Devil Kazuya's normal EWGF, Jin's AOS awakened god fist, etc.

"Except it takes at least 14 frames" 

1 - I said it was 11 OUT OF cd.

2 - Both Reina and Kazuya can do PEWGF, which is quicker than i14.

Like I said earlier, if you get half your life gone from a chain throw, that's your fault. 

You have at least 3 different chances to break the chain minimum, not counting the initial starting grab. 

Also grabs have way less reach than most launchers, longer recovery, and can be broken to take 0 damage.

TLDR: diagnosis: skill issue.
The throws can be broken, so if you're locked for "5-15" seconds that's on you. 

* Care to explain in detail how to break those then? Those are hard to break. You sound like you've done this countless times before, what better way than to learn from someone with experience.
    Yeah so what I like to do is get hit by a throw and then hop in my time machine to right before I get thrown and try again until it works.

Hope this helps.

But if you want a complete answer just press 1 for right hand 2 for left 1+2 for both.

it only has 2 floor breaks.
    When the floor is normal you need to floor break once to cause lightning to strike and turn it purple. This will automatically happen during climax if it has not already occurred (rare, usually people will take advantage of these floor breaks for combo extensions as floor breaking is the easiest combo extension in the game as it doesn't have a positional requirement like wall breaks). 

There are two kinds of breaks, hard and regular.

Hard breaks require two hits that need to be done in two separate combos. 

Descent into subconscious is a hard floor break (the only one). Into the stratosphere has a floor bounce that functions the same as a floor break that activates in climax. 

Shrine and Estate both have a hard wall break that require hitting the same wall twice. Hitting it the first time will 'damage' the wall (the bricks that make up the wall in shrine will partially fall out, the glass wall in estate will spiderweb and bend) and the second will cause a break.
Virtua Fighter says hello 👋
    I really miss VF. I used to play in ever tournament available by train 😂 the combos in VF5 got longer and higher damage though

Soul Calibur is what I like though. The combos are normally on 2-3 hits and you have air control to get out of longer combos
        That reversal edge though… 😬 they need to put SoulCalibur 2 HD on modern consoles. 
            Yeah, SC2 was the last great SC game. I miss it so much, still play it sometimes on Dolphin
                They did have an online one in HD on ps3 and 360. The 360 one is playable on Series X/S. No Link though 😆
    DOA with the hold system 

Also we have VF characters lmao
        I seriously considered just getting back into DOA 5/6 after playing Tekken 8 for 70 hours 😂
    lowjab, lowjab,lowjab,lowjab
    I haven't played them, but I pray for VF6 coming out on steam
> but it's the way fighting games are going

Was this comment made in 1994?
    Haha 😂 you certainly had combos back in the 90s. Especially on 2D fighters. However they have got progressively longer. Look at some older Tekken games, Tekken 4 had basically no juggles, Tekken 5 had a combo system but was limited, certain characters had wall travel and wall damage but most didn't (which is cool BTW and actually makes characters unique) tekken 6 was an odd game, it was less combo centric but the bound system made combos crazy. TTT2 WE DON'T TALK ABOUT!

Then Tekken 7 came along. Every character has long combos that do the same thing and everyone can go from wall to wall and deal 100 damage (bar very few characters)
Kusoge
Did you even think about your comment before posting it lol? 

Imagine if there was a gun in counterstrike that instantly killed you and then you literally didn’t get to play at all for up to almost 2 entire minutes in some cases. Oh wait, that’s all of them. Please explain how taking a combo for 10 seconds is less interactive than literally just being a spectator for minutes at a time
    You clearly have never played CS in your life and I appologise for assuming that you did. I should have used Forknife as an example for someone who is seriously comparing guns in FPS to getting stunlocked in FGs. I should have never tried to explain shit to you, but know this:

your take is bad and you should feel bad
        You sound obnoxious lol stop sniffing your own farts
            I sniff whatever the fk I want 😎💨
        you sound comically stupid. Keep crying about the fighting in your fighting game tho
            Lmaooo he got so mad. That's how you know you gotem
            Go touch some grass my dude, give your remaining braincell a rest. Maybe then you'll finally realize how dumb your argument is.
        Bro literally described every FPS with an objective game mode
I think combos go on for longer in Marvel and anime fighters tbh.
Eh, it's still kinda weird to do MSS cancels to get a combo that deals more than 60 damage. I'd say Nina's a better example of a character who got their combos "dumbed down".
    i dont think lee's combos got dumbed down, but the idea that he has to work hard for low damage is no longer true
> I'd even argue shorter combos are way more sadisfying to pull off, you get those big chunks from big chunky hits, slam the opponent into the ground, they go flying, and back to business

This is why I main Paul.
    Same for bryan, i know bryan has long combo's, but i dont use em, cuz i can get pretty big damage without em, and just punching the shit out of everyone is always more fun then whatever optimal bullshit i could dedicate 2 hours in the lab to learning, like they never even look cool, whats the point?

Also funny im getting downvotes, when im flat out saying its my opinion and that both sides has pros and cons (even if i do believe my opinion has a stronger basis to stand on) classic tekken community i guess 🤣
70% off of a df2 without walls incoming
Yes thank you. It should go back to tekken 5 levels of juggle, the good days like mvc2
Juggles or air combos have always been a part of the games. Bounds, screws/T-spins, pick-ups, and the 54 other combo extenders came with 6. People seem to be conflating the two and arguing about nothing.
    The long juggles was not a thing until 6
get hit a single time in DBFZ, MK1 and MKX, literally every Marvel game and you are watching a one minute cutscene. T8 is so much faster paced than most fighting games, this is such a crazy take lol
    Dbfz is accurate, MK GAMES HAVE COMBO BREAKERS, and Marvel vs capcom juggles are more balanced, shorter, and way harder to pull off.
        that you think MARVEL of all games is more balanced than T8 tells me all i need to know. genuinely only something you could possibly say if you have literally never seen any Marvel be played lmao
            Not the game, just the juggles. Also again aerial combos are much harder to pull off, everyone’s dishing out Tekken juggles even in the low ranks.
To add on what other people have said about other games having much longer combos (DBFZ and MvC particularly), it's worth noting that Tekken in general is extremely fast. So much so, that the standard of play is 3 rounds instead of 2 rounds like almost every other game. That's another big evidence as for why juggles in Tekken aren't as long as you think they are. Yeah they may do a lot of damage, but at least they're quick.
Right
There’s a big difference between being ‘A’ core aspect and ‘THE’ core aspect. Please learn reading comprehension before discussing.
    “If you don’t like juggles why even play tekken” the way you and everyone else defending tekken juggles like it’s your mom, I’d say you meant “the” core aspect lol
You’re not seriously implying dbfz has shorter combos than t8 are you? 😂
Ohh is that all lol
Who needs attack buttons? Guess ill win by walking only then
You saying Tag 2 era combos were shorter?
    I played both and they were shorter, most of them anyway especially when you compare wall to wall
Really? In my experience almost all df2s hit mid, but you’re saying they hit high or what? Odd, thanks for the info
    They will hit crouchers but not launch usually unless its a counter hit, yoshis df2 works this way for instance. df2's that hit crouch and launch without CH are usually punishable
        You’re so right, I always hopkick crouching targets but I guess idk… basically I never rlly noticed and was doing it by instinct, and uf3(yoshi hopkick) and df2 are so similar in my mind I thought they were the same move almost.
    Can’t say for sure but I assume one’s that hit mid, but won’t give a full combo on hit, just based off the wording.
        ? I’m not rlly sure what you’re trying to say. But DF2 and UF3/4 are ‘universal’ launchers and almost always hit mid don’t they? It’s why ducking against a king can be so dangerous because his hopkick hits mid and will launch you, same with df2. Maybe i’m missing something

Edit: i have no idea why I thought this,  I’m just so used to hopkick and df2 being practically the same move in my mind
            I know Jins df2 doesn’t launch on hit, so. I could probably test and get back to you on that, but I assume the guy is talking about stuff like that.
                Yeah I made an edit, I just instinctively have always hopkicked crouching targets, df2 and hopkick being so similar in framedata and launch angle… I was incorrectly remembering launching people with it despite actually hopkicking them lol.
                    Yea, it’s more of an exception to a rule type of thing. df2 is -9, no launch, but can cancel into crouch dash. 

uf4 is the standard -13 that everyone (but Jun) *should* have. 

Another one is Bryan, who’s df2 doesn’t launch, but uses fb2. Which is actually -7 even with a launch property.
    he's saying some df2 lauchers are safe on block and the ones that are do hit crouching opponents but it doesn't actually launch them for a combo like the unsafe df2's do which are usually -12/-14. Reina is an exception with her df2 being -12 AND doesn't launch crouching opponents.
    Some like Asuka’s DF2 will hit people crouching but won’t launch them unless on its counter hit
        Speaking of which Asuka has 4 launchers that doesn't have to be counters. 3 that hit mid/crouching opponents and 1 high.

By the way, how do you get the name of your mains under your username?
            Go to the main page for the sub, hit the dots in the top right, change user flair, pick whichever you want. They don’t have Victor so I went with my next best character
                Thanks!
            Are we talking safe or all? DF2, B3, 1+2, F2 for mid and F4 for high, right?
                English please.
                    Well, these are the Tekken notations, U(p), D(own), B(ack), F(orward), so DF is down-forward input. 1-left arm, 2 right arm, 3 left leg, 4 right leg.

So DF2 is down+forward+2 (her mid safe launcher)
F2 is her tooth fairy, long range unsafe high launch
B3 is her backflip, that is technically unsafe, hard to punish though
1+2 is her squeeze move that is perfectly safe (-9frames) with fastest offensive move (sorry Yoshi) being 10 frames.

F4 is plus on block homing high, that leads to a specific combo route.
I unfortunately don’t know. I also dont know what that has to do with getting hit by a launcher
It’s not me staying at a rank on purpose trying to get everyone to Garyu then mighty ruler. I’m like 33 percent there.
It's cold, simple, effective, and needs no words.  Like Dragunov.
    I just wish it somehow involved him crawling around as that intro is one of my favorites. Dragunov looks so mad that his sneaking was interrupted.

            Well, these are the Tekken notations, U(p), D(own), B(ack), F(orward), so DF is down-forward input. 1-left arm, 2 right arm, 3 left leg, 4 right leg.

So DF2 is down+forward+2 (her mid safe launcher)
F2 is her tooth fairy, long range unsafe high launch
B3 is her backflip, that is technically unsafe, hard to punish though
1+2 is her squeeze move that is perfectly safe (-9frames) with fastest offensive move (sorry Yoshi) being 10 frames.

F4 is plus on block homing high, that leads to a specific combo route.
He doesn’t have ice powers, he has teleportation so he can beat your ass in siberia
    That makes more sense actually.
"I respect you as a fighter" - *surfs to the mall on the opponent's face*
EWGF also has mid variants. Devil Kazuya's normal EWGF, Jin's AOS awakened god fist, etc.

"Except it takes at least 14 frames" 

1 - I said it was 11 OUT OF cd.

2 - Both Reina and Kazuya can do PEWGF, which is quicker than i14.

Like I said earlier, if you get half your life gone from a chain throw, that's your fault. 

You have at least 3 different chances to break the chain minimum, not counting the initial starting grab. 

Also grabs have way less reach than most launchers, longer recovery, and can be broken to take 0 damage.

TLDR: diagnosis: skill issue.
I generally downvote AI peddlers, yes
Yeah, SC2 was the last great SC game. I miss it so much, still play it sometimes on Dolphin
    They did have an online one in HD on ps3 and 360. The 360 one is playable on Series X/S. No Link though 😆
I sniff whatever the fk I want 😎💨
Lmaooo he got so mad. That's how you know you gotem
Go touch some grass my dude, give your remaining braincell a rest. Maybe then you'll finally realize how dumb your argument is.
Not the game, just the juggles. Also again aerial combos are much harder to pull off, everyone’s dishing out Tekken juggles even in the low ranks.
I know Jins df2 doesn’t launch on hit, so. I could probably test and get back to you on that, but I assume the guy is talking about stuff like that.
    Yeah I made an edit, I just instinctively have always hopkicked crouching targets, df2 and hopkick being so similar in framedata and launch angle… I was incorrectly remembering launching people with it despite actually hopkicking them lol.
        Yea, it’s more of an exception to a rule type of thing. df2 is -9, no launch, but can cancel into crouch dash. 

uf4 is the standard -13 that everyone (but Jun) *should* have. 

Another one is Bryan, who’s df2 doesn’t launch, but uses fb2. Which is actually -7 even with a launch property.
Go to the main page for the sub, hit the dots in the top right, change user flair, pick whichever you want. They don’t have Victor so I went with my next best character
    Thanks!
