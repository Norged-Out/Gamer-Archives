    Should have asked whips for information
    Had this song on my phone while scrolling, decided to listen to it while watching and felt I needed to share the experience.

    This is some seriously next level shit.
    Not even Neo could pull this shit in the Matrix
    HYUT TUT TUT TUT TUT TUT TUT TUT UHH
the deflecting is impressive, but I think I'm more impressed with the subtle ducking at the beginning to avoid the first kick. I guess I always assumed that the height difference from crouching wouldn't be enough to avoid attacks.
    That is the real beauty of these games.  It has felt really good since Bloodborne, where you feel like the choice of attack and timing can tuck you between their blows and connect with your own.
        Or you spam the Axe's charge R2 constantly and recover all HP after being hit lol
            that was the reason why bloodborne felt so easy for me compared to the other games. if charged enough other attacks can't interrupt you and any damage you receive gets healed instantly. also it staggers or knocks most enemies. the game basically became an R2 simulator for me.
                Well, the Axe is the easiest weapon, Ludwig is a close second. The game is completely different played with a whip, a katana or a boom hammer.
                    Damn I only play with the threaded cane. Was my first weapon I used and no matter how many times I say I’m going to play with the rapier gun I always end up with the threaded cane.
                        Probably because it's a starting weapon, and you go in with the intent of playing a skill build. You get a few hours in and suddenly you have a +6 or +9 cane and you're just going to switch weapons? No way in hell!

That's always been a criticism I have had of the souls games, sometimes you just have to wait too long to get the weapon you want.

Boss weapons in the first DS for example. I have to get all the way to the Giant in Anor Londo before I can even think about boss weapons? Fuck that.

It's especially bad in Bloodborne because you almost never find weapons barring a few exceptions. There are also tons of extra gates to quickly obtaining them.
                        Put on my top hat.

Light my cane on fire.

Bathe in the blood of beasts.
                My first playthrough I fell into that habit and didn't realize how much I relied on just powering through hits then healing then my next playthrough I tried to use Dex and the katana and got my shit pushed in, lol.

    Souls since Bloodborne has managed to have both the best and worst hitboxes of any games. You get stuff like this where the animation of your attack will make your character duck and go right under an enemy's attack or something like that, and then other times when you get grabbed an entire body length outside of what looks like the enemy's reach.
        The hit boxes are amazing, you're just failing to realize every mob who grabs have giant invisible magnets tiesd to their hands... And you're made of metal but you just don't know it.
            That seems to be in every game.  I hate grab attacks.  The Ninja Gaiden remakes were a pretty good example of why they're awful... you fight a boss, and it has, say, six attacks.  Five of them are blockable, fairly easy to dodge, and inflict a mild to moderate amount of damage when they hit, with the sixth being a grab attack which is unblockable, has minimal telegraphing, is very difficult to dodge, can hit you from practically anywhere on the screen, and takes off 80% of your health.

Although that's more extreme than most games, it's a similar issue in almost every game they appear, with the added 'bonus' of locking you into an overly long animation which, if you're lucky, you'll be forced to mash buttons to get out of it.  Dead Rising is particularly fun, since every enemy does an overly long grab attack!

It usually just feels like a mechanic thrown in to make things harder.  It's funny how an attack which is supposed to be point blank range, and often done by slow moving enemies is almost always the most dangerous attack they can do.
    You can also jump over many low sweep attacks and kick the enemy in the face.
    I was super impressed with thr hitbox during the lady butterfly fight. After hitting her 4 times she'll high kick, and I used the sweeping slash thing and just ducked under her kick and got 2 hits in for my efforts. It was so cool
    The game really has amazing hitboxes.
        Pretty great what you can do when there's no consideration for online interaction. You can make the hitboxes basically as detailed as you want.
    I just assume that everything has a huge hitbox so a high kick would hit a crouching player or something. I would never have tried it otherwise.
    This is why these games are always on r/hitboxporn
I've never played this game, but my first instinct when someone flying kicks at me is to forget all my discipline and smash every button on my controller.
    Yup, same instinct here.

That instinct means you die horrendously multiple times over.

Being prudent and blocking is wonderful, but a skill beyond me.
    I was teaching a friend how to play Bloodborne and I was explaining the importance of dodging. She didn't even look at me and said, "I don't dodge."

I laughed and said, "Haha funny, but seriously, you have to dodge."

"I told you, I don't dodge. It's not something I do."

I didn't know how to respond.
        This made me laugh out loud,  I had a friend I tried to teach mortal combat too, told him he needs to block- same response, same reaction lol
            I played MK since I bought MK1 on 3 floppy disks a long time ago. I pretty much only played that and I believe i was good at it. I practiced on the PC and dominated arcades. Around mk3 time I was at a friend's house and he had a few friends I didn't know there too. Everyone was saying one of them played really well. I remembered being excited to play against him. According to him, his tactic was to overwhelm the opponent by going full aggro and attack at all times. When we faced each other I noticed he really never blocked, ever. This was new to me, took me a couple of rounds to adjust to that but after, it was super predictable. I just dodged or blocked, countered and easily won. I was so disapointed.
However, there was another dude there who I also didn't know and barely spoke. First few rounds and I got my arse handed to me on a platter. Mf was a sleeper, no one even had any idea the guy was a fucking beast. Took me a few rounds to adjust but after that we had some pretty epic fights. I still recall to this day, I really REALLY enjoyed fighting that guy. Was the first time I actually experienced the joy of playing vs a good opponent.

Few years later, I had moved on to unreal tournament. I had a pretty good PC and I practiced a lot so I was pretty decent. We hosted lan parties at my place where everyone brought their crt monitors and desktops, network cables everywhere (wifi was a lie at the time), etc. This one time someone brought along this guy who had moved in nearby recently. The guy was a bit shy but he was easily keeping up with me in scores and I'm thinking wow this guy is a great opponent, around my level. After a few rounds I pass my seat to someone else and go watch him play on his PC. My jaw hit the floor. This mf is playing on a super shit computer, shit graphics, really low fps (like 10-20?), a tiny monitor, the crappiest 2€ mouse, etc. His setup was really bad compared to mine and yet he was easily keeping up with me. Immediately thought, fuck, this guy is not as good as me, this guy is ages better than me. It was me who needed a good computer to keep up with him. Should this guy ever play on a decent machine he would own me so bad. I wasn't wrong. I helped him improve his PC to decent levels and that guy was a beast, I got better but was never as good as him.

He's one of my best friends now and he's a raw gem. I saw him play a shitton of games over the years. I played many with him. There was never a game he was bad at, didn't really matter which.  He has a natural talent to quickly figure and be genuinely good at any game he plays. It's pretty ridiculous and I admire him a ton for that. If he was born a few years later into this era of esports I'm sure he'd be super famous. 
Shooting people in a computer wasn't real enough for him at one point so he went to airsoft. He now plays with military people who do it to practice war scenarios and he is very good at it from what I'm told. 
Man, I miss playing against him now lol.

Ops, sorry for the text wall. Your comment brought up some really good memories that I felt like taking about :)
                No need to apologize, gaming is nostalgic for me too (I'm sure most gamers could agree)! I'm glad my comment was able to evoke that from you,  it was fun to read your experience.
            All I could think of was the opening to Bioshock Infinite, "He doesn't row."
                "No, no. I said he ***doesn't*** row."   
"Ah."
        Did she get very far?..
            No.

No, she did not.
        Well then this game is probably more her speed, I had a hard time with it until I unlearned my bloodborne ways and stopped dodging.
    I wonder if we had played fewer games and had fewer button memories we would be better at this ... most of the time I simply forget what does what.
        >most of the time I simply forget what does what.

Been playing video games since childhood. I obviously KNOW where my buttons are. However, this is me, Every. Quick. Time. Event. Ever.
No matter what, I panic and I freeze and then I just digress to more primitive gaming instincts. So odd, really quite baffling to me.
            Sounds like you could use some cognitive training. That might sound weird, but it can kind of be viewed as a stat our brain has. A game like starcraft 2 can help you grind it <3
    > smash every button on my controller.

I mean if this were actual Sekiro he would be constantly hitting the attack button in a correct pattern. You always want to be executing an action in Sekiro, misses are not punished like a souls game.

Always attack if you're able to.
        Kinda... the game does reward being on the offense a lot more than other souls games, but I think the biggest part is switching between offensive and defensive play. Always attacking is going to get you killed real fast. Its about knowing when the right time to apply pressure is, and pushing that until the enemy recovers and pushes back, in which case you need to play defensively again.
            While that sounds really impressive and all, it really just boils down to attack until the enemy perfect deflects YOU. That's your cue to switch gears. That's it. This remains true for about all regular enemies while some bosses are a bit trickier.
                Right tell me how to beat that raging fucking bull then
                    Run behind it. Like, hold the run button and and constantly get in that ass.
                    Use the firecracker tool. You'll note the description says it "scares beasts." Unless it's in the middle of some animations (or possibly there is a x-many-seconds cooldown, not sure), a firecracker will cause the bull to stop and rear up, letting you rush in and deal a bit of damage.   

Also, jump toward it and to the side when it's charging if you need to dodge. Enemies in this game often seem to have [Dark Souls 2](http://cdn.themis-media.com/media/global/images/library/deriv/722/722390.jpg) magnetism on many of their attacks. As such, Dodging is frequently worthless. Or it may just have very narrow windows in which to be effective. Either way, you're definitely better off jumping against this guy.
                        Your exanarion of the busted dodging is a perfect summary. And it explains why I'm so stuck on madam whatsherface and the bull. 2 where you evidently need to be good at dodging lol
                            No, it’s no about being good at dodging. Stop dodging. Learn to deflect. Deflect is your dodge button now. Dodge is your get killed button. You’re better off holding down that dodge button and sprinting away from an enemy 99% of the time rather than dodging.
                            If you would like some help with that, I can give you some tips. If not, stop here. 

If Lady Butterfly is giving you trouble, start by learning to disengage. Just straight up run away. (Unless she's doing her big flying perilous attack, in which case run toward her.) Just keep an eye on her to block her ranged attacks just in case and run full tilt towards whichever is the far end of the room. Once you learn how far her attack combos go, you can run *just* outside of range and then turn and get in a couple punishing hits. 

Shuriken is fairly good at knocking her out of flying attacks, but I preferred to save my Spirit Emblems for the second phase. If you can't seem to get her dead, try coming back once you have the Umbrella tool and the Projected Force skill. Don't bother with snap seeds. You *want* her to have all her summons up, then just run around until she dismisses them into homing projectiles. Position yourself by a pillar to block a handful of them so as not to break your posture, but tank the brunt of them with the Umbrella up. Get close to her, and the Projected Force attack will knock like 1/5 of her HP off.
                                Thanks for the tips! I'll try to worm on these as we as using the firecracker tool better
                    Dont chase its butt.  Chasing butt is for hacks.

Wait for the bull to charge, and perfect parry when it runs straight at you head first.  You literally knock it on its ass and open it up to getting sliced and diced.
                        Everyone who comments any other strategy than this one is wrong, and is doing it wrong, and is wasting theirs and your time. Parry that knockup head attack, get in 2-3 slices, back up and do it again. Throw in some firecrackers for extra hits. After about 5 parries, you'll fill his posture bar at only about half his vitality.
                        WHAT?! The parry knocks it down?? I must have never had a successful parry on it then...
                            It only knocks it down on certain attacks.  The key to the bull is to get some space and parry the attack when he runs at you, dips his head, and then tries to gore you.  It's easy as hell to parry and knocks him down.

The "stay behind the bull" people are giving you bad advice.  It's possible to do it that way, but it's way harder and it's teaching you bad habits for the rest of the game.  Parry >>>> dodging when possible for every single fight in the game except for one optional boss at the very end.
                    Well, apart from gimmick bosses like that I'm referring to anything with a sword (or spear). But as for the raging bull in particular, try pretending you're a bullfighter :)
            Dark souls is basically a very slow dance of doge attack, dodge dodge dodge attack. This game has a different rythm to it, a lot of the time its block block attack attack attack, block (for a while) then back into attack. There's a dancing of being in defence to a very sudden attack pattern and like you said, they push back eventually so you need to go back to defence, It took me a while to get the rhythm down but I eventually died. I'm pretty sure I ready somewhere that the bosses in the game work on a certain metronome rhythm, if you play that tick-tock sound you know when there's another attack coming.
            Rushing is a form of hesitation, and hesitation is defeat, right?
    Do you want to die? Because that's how you die.
        Finally, I have the answer I’ve been searching for!
    I’m just starting to get over that, after getting killed like twenty times in a row and realizing button mashing the counter button wasn’t gonna work no matter how many times I tried.
    Sekiro combat rules 101:
Kick=dodge
Spear = kick (it's a specific counter)
Sword=counter

If u do any of these for a different one you are going to have a bad day.
        [deleted]
    My first instinct after years of Dark Souls is to dodgeroll everything. That’s not how to play Sekiro.
I am REALLY starting to love this game. I've sunk about 45-50 hours into and I'm in NG+ right now, and it just keeps getting better and better for me. The combat is quickly becoming an absolute joy to partake in. This is the first souls game that I've searched out people to fight because the combat is soooo enjoyable.
    My problem with these games is always more about the navigation than the fighting. I’m bad at the fighting but I could power through if I had a better idea of my goal.
        You and me both, buddy.
        I don't know, this game is pretty damn linear if you just read the dialogue. If you straight up follow the story to the first ending its like 15 hours long.
            33 minute speedrun would like a word

But yeah, to play the game as intended you're right haha
                That record (which is now sub 27) uses a number of exploits, along with taking the shortest ending. Most people are going to run into the Immortal Severance ending with is considerably longer. Just doing that ending with no exploits is over an hour speed running IIRC.
            I'm at the monkeys with 32hours on it ... :'(
                I was also at the monkeys at roughly 30 hours in. I took my time exploring every little crevice though.
                    I just beat monkeys 10 minutes ago at 28 hours. Kinda funny we all took roughly the same amount of time to get there even though I'm sure we all have different amounts of different areas explored. Neat that the game branches out and pretty much lets you do whatever until you're happy to continue the plot.

/u/Lorithias: Kill the brown monkey before finishing the headless chap. He's considerably weaker and then you can focus 1v1 again.
        Just gotta explore. Having a hard time somewhere? Look somewhere else. After awhile go back and give it another try. Sekiro is fairly linear but if you’re really stumped there’s no harm in checking a guide.
        Your goal is to exhaust all options until you can proceed. My problem is that it is one uphill battle after another.
        I find this one's a lot nicer to you than Dark Souls where you're just told you have to link the fire and a general instruction on how to do it or Bloodborne where the only guidance you have is "end the nightmare".

in Sekiro, someone's telling you what you have to do and it's pretty linear.  The first part is "save the heir" and you know he's in the castle and that's the only way to go.
        This is a common complaint and I totally understand.  Moving from point A to point B without knowing where the fuck point B even is or how to get there infuriates a lot of people, but that process of trial and error is precisely what some people like me love so much.  To each his own.  I obsess over these games and wish all my friends loved them as much as me, but I totally get it
        Sekiro is way more linear and less confusing to navigate through than Dark Souls.
        This game has frustrated me so much because of not being sure where I'm supposed to be going. Two specific times in the game (one early on, the other right near the end) I reach a boss that gives me extreme, unbelievable trouble (first Lady Butterfly, and later the Demon of Hatred) where I run into a wall dying over and over and over, only to give up and look them up on the wiki and find out that they're an optional fight and I could have just gone down a different path I didn't even know was there. This is a perfect example of why the game's difficulty (and it reputation for such) is a detriment to the gaming experience- in another game you'll reach a brick wall boss and think "Oh, I'm supposed to come back later", but in this game, there's no way of knowing if I'm supposed to come back later or if I'm just supposed to git gud and power through it.
            This is an odd thing. If you can't do something, you go and explore. That's video games 101. Has been forever.
            Based on what your saying, if you treated it like a normal game then you would be fine. Can’t beat this boss? Go explore. It makes the game way easier as you get more skills and more health. I went to Lady Butterfly and immediately left to go explore more of the game and came back with twice the amount of health and posture, making the fight way easier. I’m pretty sure there was another point where I had an option of three different main bosses because I had decided to go kill all the mini bosses in their areas first, making all the main bosses easier.
            Then Lobosjr beats it no damage, level 1, naked. 3 days after the game comes out.
            There’s always other paths to explore though. When I struggle with a boss, I go explore another area that I haven’t explored yet.

Eventually I might hit multiple walls, but by that point I end up beating one of the bosses I struggled with preciously. 

That being said though, this game definitely lacked direction more than other FS games imo. I discovered The Monks and ashina depths before even beating Genichiro for example lol.
                I think discovering Monks and Depths is totally legit before fighting Genichiro. Recommended in one sense with how much it helps you upgrade skills and collect prayer beads. That’s the way I went!

In general, I think Sekiro encourages the player to explore and beat mini bosses for beads before taking on main bosses.
            If you run into a wall, no reason to keep hitting. Up until the very end of the game, there's _always_ two or three various paths you can go down at any time. It's an incredibly open game and can be tackled in a ton of various orders. There's very few spots where it's "You're meant to go this way, and then this way." Every route as harder and easier spots, and you're meant to go down which ever way you choose, or even go down one area a bit, back and then another for a bit, and then back, whatever. 

Try not to think of it like "what's the way I'm supposed to go right now" and just go wherever you're feeling like.
            I really couldn’t disagree more. Both of those instances are clearly optional if you’re paying attention to what the npcs are telling you. Even if you find the bell from the lady first, the sculptor tells you where you goal actually is. The entire way to DoH is optional because, again, they tell you exactly where your destination is and how to get there. This tells me you didn’t listen to the characters and just spammed past their dialogue.
            It's pretty much a hallmark of this studio that their games don't explain much of anything and then punish you for not knowing what was never explained.
                Definitely; but since every interview and review insisted that this game was NOT a soulsborne, I had no way of knowing whether this game would be the same in that regard.
    I've tried and failed to beat lady butterfly for 3 days now.
        Shurikens, snap seeds
            Also just getting a small amount of damage on her really impacts her posture recovery speed. From there you can pretty much just parry everything and she dies. No need to worry too much about anything besides staying alive once you've hit her 3 or 4 times.   
Still not nearly as easy as just shooting a bunch of shurikens up her ass when shes jumps onto a wire, but much more satisfying when you get the kill.
        you can cheese her pretty hard on the first part. If you have the art that closes distance (i forget what it's called, but it's a jumping flip forward).

two attacks, then the jump and she'll be caught in an endless loop.

In the second phase, whenever she does her illusion thing, just run in a circle around the arena until they're gone, but other than that, this one's harder to cheese.
        instead of sidestepping, you can keep sprinting around her and get a chance to attack. She cant deflect if you are on her backside. when she is in the air you can use the shuriken to knock her down and charge an attack on her. good luck
    [deleted]
        Whos the first boss? Do you mean lady butterfly, gyoubu, or the ogre?
            [deleted]
                The actual bosses do get you to be better at the game, though. Lady Butterfly tip: ignore her illusions and just run around the edge of the arena until she dispels it. Also, Shuriken is godly in that fight.
                    It's also far easier to so with another gourd seed and an attack up from the first full boss.  Trying to finish her off first is difficult.  I beat her the second try after coming back then.
                    I found out last night when I finally managed to beat her that you can stop her from ever summoning the illusions if you keep pressure on her all through the second phase. She always appears by the big statue after the first deathblow so you can just run over and wait for her to appear and start attacking her before she even has a chance to do anything.
                        I tried doing that, but she would always jump and summon before I could close the gap. Did you corner lock her or something?
                            Now that I think about it I did push her back towards the statue each time so she didn't have far to run for that initial attack. I just stayed glued to her the entire time and she generally acted like she did in the first phase, but with the butterflies added in. The only time she managed to get off the summon after I started being so aggressive was when I'd jump away to heal.

Granted, I the only reason I was able to get so aggressive was because I practically memorized her patterns after days of dying over and over haha
                                Sounds like my experience with Genichiro. If that battle taught me anything, it was “don’t panic” and “for the love of god, the ogre should have taught you this, DON’T GET GREEDY!”
                    You can also run around and occasionally hit the illusions at opportune times, which one shots them and replenishes shuriken charges
                You're there a bit too early if this is your first boss.

Should've fought the horseman first.
                    MY NAME IS GYUBO ONIWA
                        MY NAME IS GYUBO ONIWA *slashes the horse 5 times*
                            BRAT!
                    Oh is Gyubo considered the "first" boss? If that's the case, maybe there's hope for me yet! That's the fight where it first started feeling like I was getting a hang of the game.

I mean, he still kicked my ass a bunch of times, but once I got a good rhythm of deflecting his charges and grappling over the long sweep attack, it actually felt doable. Only had to use the firecrackers twice when I finally beat him!

^^And ^^then ^^the ^^bull ^^made ^^me ^^his ^^plaything...
                        This is kinda what happened to me in dark souls 1. I went to the graveyard with the skeletons right after the tutorial, and kept fighting them until i could kinda kill a couple. Then i was like "fuck me this game isnt just hard its bullshit" then i found the eay to the aquaduct and started killing the undead there like 'oh... thiiiis is the first area'
                            This was me in Dark Souls 2, lol
                                Not trying to be rude, but how? DaS2 starting area leads to 3 different areas, 1 which I'm sure won't find first time as it requires you to have a ton of Health or the ring that nullifies fall damage. So you really only have 2 paths the first time and neither of them leads to a high level area. One leads to the giant boss and the other to the big guy with armor (forgot it's name) and neither of them are hard or at least not late into the game hard. The guy with armor in particular, you can bait him and he'll kill himself by falling off the platform lol.
                                    Probably Dragonrider area I’m guessing. I didn’t find it very hard either but the forest of giants is much easier to fight some easy enemies and level up a bit. The giant soldiers can be really aggravating if you’re new to the series.
                        The real bosses drop memories. Mini bosses drop prayer beads.
                            Except for the anomaly of Headless Ape which gives 2 prayer beads and a memory.
                            ah, that's an easy distinction to remember. thanks!
                        I'm with you on all this. That bull fight was stupid.
                            Bull fight was a game changer. I had to rework my entire playstyle around the douche. I ended up using all my gourds, pellets, and rez to get that bastard down on the 5th go. The wiki really helped me out on the fight as well.
                                I'm back to getting my shit pushed in by Lady Butterfly and Ashina Elite.
                                    You can cheese the Elite with the spear if you want.   He can't really deal with it.   Fighting fair is for samurai, not shinobi.
                                    Easy strat for the elite: just deflect.

He has this double attack that you can bait if you stay on range. Just spam block once he starts charging it and then back away. 3-4 times and you can finish him. Do that twice and he's dead.

There are multiple bosses in the game in which spamming block and doing nothing else makes the whole fight completely trivial
                        How did you get the firecracker before fighting him???
                            Apparently firecrackers can be bought from the Mob merchant before the ogre, but I never found that the first time through.
                            There's a memorial mob that sells it at the top of a cliff kind of near the old woman that gives you the bell. You have to grapple up to the top.
                It doesn't get easier, but there totally is an "aha" moment in regards to blocking/parrying being insanely powerful.
                My first 15-20 hours of playing, I just got wrecked over and over again, but then it finally 'clicked' for me and the game got a ton more fun.

There were definitely moments where I wasn't sure if I'd ever get good enough to really enjoy the game, but, I did, eventually.
                Lady Butterfly isn't the first boss. Shes an optional side quest boss that's fairly difficult. Come back to her later in the game.
                Butterfly is an optional boss, you actually don't even need to kill her.
                Dodge attack is your best friend, stick with it. We believe in you.
                    Specifically for Lady Butterfly that works well. Pretty much every boss has a "simple" way to beat them

&#x200B;

>!Ogre - All of his attacks (except his one "fast" grab) are really really slow, at least by Sekiro enemy standards. He's also really difficult because you lack healing gourds and most people think you \*need\* to get two finisher blows on him unlike most other minibosses where you can get a sneak attack off. You can actually use Gacchin sugar to sneak up on the ogre - or aggro him and then lose aggro and get him much easier after he's broken free.!<

>!Gyoubu - Blocking works really well against him - you don't need to worry much about your posture because he gives you long breaks to recover posture - and a lot of free hits with the grapple-attack (if you have it). Firecrackers help, but definitely not necessary.!<

>!Blazin Bull - Even difficult on new game+, but if you deflect his charge like a matador you can wear his posture down before he kills you. Use dousing powder to keep from burning, and heal up when you get the chance. Also I've watched a lot of people struggle against him on streams/youtube but they don't seem to realize you can stay locked on to him and sprint around, which makes dodging him really really easy.!<

>!Guardian Ape - Pretty tough, since you really need deal a lot of vitality damage to end up beating him - but he has several attacks that leave him open for a few free hits. Also, you can still deflect him - I've seen many people not even try to block or deflect his attacks. They are erratic, but if you're disciplined in holding your block up you shouldn't get surprised too much.!<

>!Guardian Ape (headless) - The freaky factor puts a lot of people off, but his attacks are really telegraphed (easy to deflect or \*at least block\*), and if you can recognize his scream of terror then you shouldn't really even need to use pacifying agents. Also, the loaded spear (i think it's the spiral upgrade) deals massive damage to him if you can get him at the right time.!<

>!Guardian Ape (re-fight) - During the two ape portion of the fight the second ape doesn't attack super often, and it has lower vitality and breaks posture more easily - but if you keep your distance you can still probably take out the headless one and if you do then the second ape dies at the same time.!<

>!Genichiro - Attack when he isn't attacking, and deflect after he \*perfect\* deflects your strike. The timing is fairly easy to learn, and many sworded enemies have the same style where you attack until you get perfect deflected and then switch to something defensive. Deflect his jumping slash and it does a lot of posture damage. His second phase is still pretty tough, but if you can get the lighting reversal down then it's actually a really easy fight. Some of his timing and patterns are a little different, but he has the same basic attack patterns.!<

>!Long-arm centipede - Some people find him really easy but others struggle a ton on him. His flurry is really intimidating, but it only takes like two flurries to get his posture broken, and jump and stomp his head after his sweep for aton of posture damage.!<

Aaand there are others but i'm tired of typing. I'm sure there are better ways to beat them than what I've listed too, which is beautiful.
                Things click eventually, but pace yourself. Sekiro isn't one of these games you play for hours & hours each day (if you have the time in the first place). Understanding parrying & how to counter deathblows is key. 

If you're keen to try Lady Butterfly again there's a very easy tactic that doesn't even use blocking. When she attacks dodge to the right & use the dodge slash, then she'll kick again, dodge to the right & slash, on & on. Since you dodge out of the way she resets her combo & that slow kick is easy to dodge & since you're interrupting an attack from the side you're getting a proper hit in & she's not deflecting or guarding. When she jumps in the air, all you have to do is throw a shuriken & she'll fall on her face allowing you a couple hits.
                Another tip for lady butterfly if no one has said it already. You can get in 2 swings before she counter attacks so the pattern to whittle her posture down is attack attack deflect. Repeat that and pressure her enough to break her posture. If she jumps up Shuriken immediately and repeat if she gets knocked down. It’s all about breaking her posture
                    Yet another tip; in phase two you don’t need snap seeds to dispel the illusions - just sprint around the perimeter until they go away!
                Shuriken her in the air, side step to her right. What combat art are you using?
        Horse bro isn’t too hard once you figure out you just have to wait for the grapple indicator for free damage. Can legit just block the rest of his attacks since he runs past you with all of them anyways.
            Also if you figure out the single prosthetic that literally every animal-based boss is vulnerable too, that fight becomes a pretty big joke.
        Which one was that? because a lot of people consider Genichiro the first 'Boss' in the game. Even though you fight a few before him. 

In any case, I hate to sound like a broken record with this comment, but a whole lot of people are treating Sekiro like just another souls game, when it really is a completely different beast. I rage quit Genichiro the first time I fought him too. I literally couldn't understand how people were beating him. I looked up YouTube videos. I read articles. I did everything I could possibly think of to go into that fight with an advantage...and I STILL couldn't beat him. It's cliche, but I literally had to accept the combat system before I even stood a chance. But even after I rage quit, I couldn't help but think about beating him at work the next day. lol

Eventually, the combat just clicked, and I FINALLY beat him. The entire game changed for me after that. It took on a whole new tone and challenge for me. I just fought Genichiro in NG+ yesterday and didn't even break a sweat during the fight. 

It's just like learning the intricacies of Dark Souls and then getting good at that system. It just takes time and an open mind. 

Sorry for the long rant. I just feel like a lot of people who i've talked to about the game have the same mentality towards it.
            Genichiro is the line that divides people who know how to play the game and people who don't.

Later bosses are technically more impressive and difficult, but Genichiro is downright perfect. No tricks, no gimmicks, no cheesing. You just need to be good enough.
                I did lady butterfly first, and she was way harder for me.
            Which is funny... As I thought Genichiro was ridiculously easy for a big fight, and struggled forever on Butterfly.  Each boss has a different rhythm that different people Excel at.  For me Genichiro is exact the type I like, patterned predictable low reaction speed boss.  He hits hard, but easy to wear down (for me, of course).

I also had killed just about every side boss and Lady butterfly before getting to him though...  So I likely had already struggled enough to get good at sword fights.  Spears...  Me and the mekiro counter don't get along.  High reaction speed fights like seven Spears or ashina elite I cheesed through with Spears and axes...
            Same kinds thing happened for me in dark souls, I remember I had spent probably 45 minutes fighting the nameless king on my first playthrough which was just a grind of me throwing myself at him, something clicked and then when I started a new playthrough on ng+ I beat him on the first try. it's so satisfying to see visible improvement in these types of games.
    When I first played this game, I found the combat to be boring. But it was my fault because I did not use a single tool or combat art through my whole solid first playthrough.

Idk why...
    Not a souls game
    Wait. It's a souls game? As in dark souls?
    It’s not a souls game.
    I've sunk about the same amount of time in and haven't gotten past the Shinobi Hunter soooo... Kudos to you man lol
    Help me understand combat.  I suck
Sold! I didn’t even have time to complete RDR but I guess I’ll do what I always do, get easily distracted.
    [deleted]
        Unsold!
            Lmao
            There are some user made mods, on PC at least, that let you show it down to your level.
                I have old man reflexes, and I get hard stuck on every boss and miniboss. Thanks for the tip. Maybe the 60$ wasn't wasted.
                    Yeah I needed to take a break from this game because my old man reflexes just aren't working with this game. i've beaten 2 bosses... out of 13... just the thought of bosses being significantly more difficult than what I've already faced makes me wish I didn't buy the game. But the game is beautifully done... it's just not for us old guys
        How is time slowed then? Is it just slow mo applied to the video, or a cheat?
            Its slowed in post. The game doesn't have 16:9 blackbars either. Whoever made this was trying to make it look cinematic
                They were trying to crop out the UI and figured this was the best way to do it, yeah.
                    You can actually turn off the hud in the display settings.
                Judging by how smooth the movement looks when slowed down, I'm going to guess that the game was played and recorded with slowmo cheat, and then sped up in post. Unless it was being run with unlocked frame rate, and hitting a couple hundred FPS
                    Pretty sure that the game is capped at 60 even on pc.
                        i think there is mod that unlocks framerate
            There is actually a program out right now that allows you to slow the game and speed up the player. It's as close to an easy mode as you can get for this game.
            Theres a mod which you can use to slow down the animations of the enemies
                You can open the logo in ms paint and write "you win" under it, too
                    Idk the name but if you search for the "i beat sekiro with cheats and i feel fine" article mentioned it, u can find it there
        Yep
    Gamer ADD ftw!
    > I guess I’ll do what I always do, get easily distracted.

Play for 4 hours and then nope the fuck out!
When you finally realize there is no ~~spoon~~  katana
Fuck all that noise I just puppeteer the one on the left and watch them kill each other
    I arrived through the window you leave from at first and was so confused how tf that fight was possible with both the kicky bois.
    If it’s the room you’re thinking of with the mini boss, this is a differerent room earlier with the ceiling hole.
    Puppeteer the first, let them fight with the 2 blue robed samurai, zip up to the hole in the ceiling, drop down, stealth kill the last one in the next room, and finally return to clean up the previous fight. 

For bonus XP, jump down from the main room and stealth kill the red guard and finish off his buddy standing on the opposite side of the door. 

All in all you're looking at ~6K experience.
    Lol ya puppeteer feels like one of the stronger ninjutsus, having a buddy to distract them is a pretty big help.
I love how they made the hit boxes so rediculously precise for stuff like this but when it comes to the chained ogre and guardian apes grabs its the most unforgiving shit ever
    The ogre’s tracking drop kick is BS.
        Firecrackers make ogre obsolete.
            I just burned the mothafucka
    Yeah, except for those grabs and one of the demon of hatreds move, this game has excellent hitboxes.
    “Why didn’t you dodge?”

“I did but he has the Force.”
    You can jump over guardian apes grab
        It's all good I used the unbeatable strategy on it, worked like a charm
SMOKIN SEXY STYLE!!!
    Jackpot!
Would a person that's never really enjoyed any of the souls games enjoy this? Because I dont want to sink money on a game and not enjoy it.
    Tough to answer.

Did you not like Souls games because they were hard? If so, this game is something you need to avoid. It's arguably harder.

If, however, you didn't like Soul's game's combat focus around primarily blocking or rolling, and wanted something a bit more offensive and intense...then this just might be for you.

Also, if you're a lore nut and didn't like Souls games for their obscure lore and lacking a coherent story....well, I won't say that this is an Old-School Bioware RPG, but it definitely tells a more complete story comparatively speaking.
        Yeah the combat in the Soul's games were a bit annoying and repetitive so I didn't like it much. If its fast and upbeat fighting then I think I will like this game. Thanks!
            Ok so, the skill ceiling in this game is quite high. But it *can* feel *very* repetitive early on, when it feels like you're just mashing attack over and over. But in general, the combat is very snappy and quick. A step beyond BB, and way behind Souls, in that regard.
            Not the person you’re speaking too, but the combat is sensational. I will say I’m biased; having played and beat all previous souls games. That being said, if you were a fan of something like ninja gaiden or other oldschool hacknslash action titles and love a brutal challenge, this game is for you!
                ninja gaiden black is one of my fav games ever, loved the difficulty and gameplay, def getting sekiro now that i've seen this comparison.
                    It really is the bastard love child of Ninja gaiden, dark souls, and tenchu
                    You won’t regret it! I was a huge fan of ninja gaiden black as well. You’re gonna love sekiro.
        Argh, here's my answer to your questions:

1) Souls too hard? Yes

2) Like offensive and intense? Yes

3) Lore nut? Heck yeah

Conclusion, I may get this game at a deep discount haha.
        I personally thought most Sekiro bosses were easier than soulsborne bosses once you get semi-decent at deflecting, because I usually don't have to worry about invincibility frames or  discovering which direction to dodge into (aside from perilous attacks).... except for certain bosses like Demon of Hatred and others that inflict status effects through your guard.  I just have to deflect and a lot of bosses and minibosses basically just  self destruct.
    Don't like souls games, I like this.

It's very fast and there are a bunch of mechanics beside just fighting. Stealth lets you clear an area often enough, you can escape from anything short of bosses. The extra mobility and verticality means you can flee and kill more on reset, otherwise you can go to a checkpoint and heal up. Also means death is less of an inconvenience because you can dive right back in. It's also not about chipping away health in the least, it's about breaking an enemy posture using deflections and small hits and then getting an execution.

However it's balls hard, apparently as hard if not harder than Souls. It's built around deflections that you cannot be bad at. And this isn't "parry gives instakill" this is "six irregularly timed parries and if you fuck up it's half your health each, if you succeed you may get one hit in". You don't get to sit outside range and wait for parries, you need to get stuck in hitting attacks and recover when you get parried, it's very much about fast swap of momentum. Your own posture drains whenever you get hit or block get deflected and they will annhilate you if it breaks.

But when you get deflections down it gets much easier, and then some later skills trivialise a few mechanics and enemies.
    Did you dislike the Souls games because they are difficult? If so, no. You will not.

Did you dislike the Souls games because of the setting? If so, you might.

Did you dislike the Souls games because of the gameplay? If so, no. You probably won't.

Did you dislike the souls games because of the ambiguity of the everything from the story, to the lore? If so, you might.

It's a phenomenal game. But as much as Soulsborne players want to call it "not-a-souls-like-game," it's very much a Souls-like game for the average gamer.
    Probably not, it's hard, fast and unforgiving
    Idk why people bring souls to compare. They are nothing alike. This game is completely different and I will say that it is much more enjoyable than souls games. 

This game somehow makes you feel like a legend, it's tough and punishing but turns out to be an easy game once you master the block button. You become a god. It is always satisfying to kill enemies with deathblows. 

Initially the game is brutally difficult. But you get better at the game, not your character. It gets easier and easier, of course it is still hard as shit. You die a lot. Bosses are awesome, some are bullshit and most of them are actually so awesome to fight.

Tools and skills are fun, you can come up with some cool looking attacks.

If you are unsure just wait for a special, then get it or borrow it or try it on a friend's account. Game is great.
        Agree, it is not similar to Dark Souls combat wise. The items,  menus, and interactions with NPCs are similar, but that is it. The movement and combat are very different, with great focus on verticality. I started playing the game with a Dark Souls mentality, and that worked against me. It is hard, but well balanced, and it is a bit more forgiving on death.
        Yeah I agree with this.  After my first play through and knowing how to fight bosses i was obsessed with going back to fight them.  Madam butterfly kicked my ass the first time, but I beat her first try on the replay.  The general at the top of the tower took me 45-1hr of trying and failing first play through and I kicked his ass second try on the next one.  It was like a dance striking him to bait him to strike me so I could deflect and going back and forth with him over and over.  It was intoxicating and addictive.  I never replay games, and I've already completed it 3 times lol.  I wish there was a mode where I could just fight the bosses over and over.  It's honestly the most compelling and enjoyable gameplay in any game i've experienced.
    I personally never enjoyed the souls games because I always felt there was a bit of SURPRISE! You're dead. Well fine, I guess I won't die to the surprise because I know it's there now. (that may be inaccurate but that was my feel)

This game, with how mobile you can be, even if you walk into a trap as long as you keep your wits you can get out. That and they have what felt like a plethora of save points to capture progress. I also loved the combat system.
    Depends. What didn't you enjoy about the Souls games?
    I’ve only new gamed dark souls 3 and the rest I couldn’t finish because of weak motivation. I can say for certain Sekiro has rightfully hooked me in with 25 hours in 3 days. I sucked at it then got good enough to beat a boss I was stuck on to only find a new boss to repeat the cycle. It’s really rewarding to beat a boss though so I recommend Sekiro if you like gratification.
    I am a big fan of action games and absolutely loved ninja gaiden on the Xbox, but never really got into the souls games because of the slow deliberate nature of combat and the stamina system. I really like sekiro because it turns up the pace of combat and gives you alot more mobility. If that's the kind of games you like, you'd like sekiro
    This game is harder than souls, but you are way way less lost and you don't have to worry about building your character wrong.
    I didn’t like any of the souls game but this is great.
    I haven't been able to make much progress is the souls games, but this game I've been able to pick up and love. I think it's the most accessible souls game.
    I would recommend dark souls 3 first. This game is easily the hardest and most unforgiving to me. At least with the souls game you can invite a friend to help and sometimes bring an NPC ally in for support. Plus if you still struggle you could grind souls to level up. This just isn’t an option in Sekiro.
You did good, son.
You did good.
    No he didnt. This is a repost from yesterday...
        Wow it must be such a challenge to live in this world for you.
Those one armed dudes are so strong
    they actually have 2 arms, they're just hiding the other for sneak attacks
        Really? That explains a few things lol
            They use it for throwing kunai at you if you're far enough
60 hours in, 2nd playthrough currently sitting at NG+. I don't know this crouching dodge is possible... LOL start loving this game more.

Sekiro is definitely not a game for everyone. It is most punishing at the beginning of the game to an extreme degree. If you get hard locked there you will probably lose patience, stop and dislike it. But once you surpass that part you will find yourself fall in love. It is really weird.
    Yea part way through the combat just clicks and you suddenly feel like a master samurai. It's very satisfying just not at first. First time I fought one of these purple bros it felt impossible. Now I take em down in seconds without a scratch.
    Hitting L3 in time seems difficult... It's not a quick button to push.  Glad to know it's possible at least.
    Right? When I first started, I had all the dark souls muscle memory ingrained and couldn't fight anyone. An epiphany during the Genichiro fight turned me into a monster. NG+ is now cake.
    All From games are hard early and get easier, and then get harder again.

Learning while weak, proficiency with advancement, mastery while strong

That's the curve most From games take. When you only have 500 HP in Bloodborne or Dark Souls and the enemies hit for like 200 while you have negligible defenses, it feels super punishing. Especially when you haven't learned the basic attack patterns or tricks you can employ to make yourself super OP early on. But then you gain some levels, gain some HP and defense, and you know the patterns? Eh, everything feels fair and even easy.
Okay, that was badass.
That crouch is epic hit box porn.
My goodness this game looks good!
    It is good!
Every time I see gameplay of this it just makes me think of how much I want a Ninja Gaiden Black revival. Ninja Gaiden 3 was an embarrassment to team ninja, and should've never happened. Ninja Gaiden Black was straight up perfection for me at the time. Brutally punishing, extremely rewarding to people who knew the game.

Except for wall jump attacks being completely op.
    This is the comment I was looking for. Im trying to understand why everyone is blown away by Sekiro when it looks pretty janky compared to the combat of Ninja Gaiden Black or even NG 2, both made over 10 years ago lol. 

It makes me want to fire up NG2 and record a few battles and upload them. Like damn, NG combat looks way more sick than this!
I need to get back in omg this is fuel, I just sorta took a break after beating tower lightning guyyyyy
Wait....that was gameplay?
Yeah your pretty much shit at the game, then you get how it works and your still shit, then one day it clicks and those purple ninjas bastards are nothing more then a minor nuisance.
How to block a flying kick by holding up your sword.
    You hold your sword in front of it
        Thanks
    There are much more insane things you can parry. Like the flaming horns of an elephant sized bull, or every piece of shot fired from a shotgun cannon at point blank range.
        Wait... You can parry that boss?!
            You can parry anything that isn’t a perilous attack.
                You can still parry stabs.
                    You just have to shout MIKIRI COUNTER at the top of your lungs.
    This guys is definitely not a game journalist
I can't believe this is the actual game. The intricacies in the combat are blowing my fucking mind
This game looks so cool, but I hate the idea of buying something that is probably too difficult for me to ever finish
    Same.  I was really interested in it until I found out it was supposed to have a punishing level of difficulty like Dark Souls.  Now I'll just wait a year or two and pick up a Game of the Year edition for like $20.
        If you ever get into Sekiro, the game is a prime example of "you need to learn what the game is trying to teach you".

Right now the biggest advice for beginners is:

* Understand how the Posturing system works and how to take advantage of it.

* Understand that attacks (both yours and your enemy's) have wind-ups, follow through's, and stun states; do not plant down in front of an enemy hoping to engage in a stationary DPS battle.

* Do not engage in combat against large groups, you WILL fail. Use your mobility (wall climbing/grappling hook) to get away and kite apart enemies to single them out.

-----

Let's use Resident Evil 2: Remake as another example:  
Many people say that the appearance of Mr. X in the mid-game makes the game too hard because it means that you have to navigate the Police Station with him chasing you.

The purpose of all the back tracking in the beginning is to teach you the floor plan of the Police Station and how to navigate the spaces, the addition of Mr X in the mid-game is the game saying "okay, now do it fast".
    The feeling of overcoming something you've tried for so long to get it indescribable.
Can't wait for this to go on heavy discount after I get through my extensive backlog. KH3 has been completed, just need to finish RDR2 and Spider-Man before getting my samurai on.
I struggled like mad parrying because I was informed you had to parry as the strike hits you, rather than before the strike hits. Once I figured that out, things got much easier
Props to the ninja who can straight up kick sharp swords with only sandals on
Sigh....*\*unzips pants\**
"He's beginning to believe!"
Achktually the third hit got him but he was in "guard" stance after deflecting the second one so he didn't fly away like a super santos
I was fine not owning this.  Now I'm not.
Can't wait to get there. Brb attempting lady butterfly for the 50th time.

    shes really easy if you just \*says things but all's you hear is static\*
    Spam Dodge counter. It's such an easy exploit that stun locks her =/.
I need to get back to this game.   I am at lady red and some ghost samurai and I just said enough of this shit.   Needed to take a break it was annoying me so much.   Just haven't come back.   First time I have done with with a From game.
    Corrupted Monk and Lady Butterfly?

You're pretty far in.
        Far in? Butterfly was the second boss I killed. Well she is optional she could be the first boss if you choose to do her that way.
    What
        Butterfly and Corrupted Monk, presumably.
    corrupted monk i could bet my life on that i wouldnt get hit, and i cheese most bosses. just run in circles and attack during his animation resets.  BUT ATTACK ONLY ONCE.
"He is starting to see"
i would love an ingame slow mo option to turn on for fights. kinda like how in Smash bros you can play a slow mo mode.
This is just magical... This is one of the many reasons I play videog ames
This has slowly become one of my top 10 favorite games of all time. It is hands down the best iteration of sword combat to date, and a serious challenge. When I got to the first Genichiro fight, I legitimately thought this was the end game fight and I had to fight more bosses/mini-bosses to get stronger because I died to him over and over. Little did I know I was barely halfway through the game and Genichiro was one of the easiest bosses. Do not get me started on Guardian Ape.
This will give you such an amazing feel that Dark Souls games can't do. I love the combat in this game.

It's hard but when things click right it feels great.
Ultra Instinct Wolf
That's cool and all, but you're lucky they attacked the way they did.

Me? I get ganged bammed cuz they all swing at the same time and an arrow hits me shortly after the block animation just as some dude behind me kicks me.
This is some anime shit
> I've sunk about 45-50 hours into

> The combat is quickly becoming an absolute joy to partake in

These two things confuse me a bit. Did it take 45-50 hours before combat became a joy?
    Probably because initially this game will beat the shit out of you, and for the next 10+ hours you just play rather conservatively i.e. spamming dodge, attacking recklessly, running away, stealthing most levels, etc.

When you figure things out the combat is pretty amazing to play. Parrying multi-hit combos consistently, using and switching tools effectively, knowing the perfect timing for your special moves etc. They made parrying and deathblows feel impactful that its always satisfying when you do it, even more when its deliberate and not by accident.
    Game starts a bit slow, but once you unlock new abilities and prosthetics and also improve your parrying and evading skills, it becomes exponentially enjoyable.

Ahhhh so thats ultra instinct
Sekiro is simply Osu with Ninjas
Should I get this game? I started playing Bloodborne before this came out to familiarize myself with the gameplay but I just keep getting my ass kicked and I can't get out of the first area. Is this game any better? Not really interested in spending 60 bucks to just die constantly and not progress whatsoever.
    If you can’t get past the first area of bloodborne, you will stand no chance here, to be blunt.
        [deleted]
            No, but if you quit before beating Gascoine you’ll probably quit before beating Genichiro too.
        I struggled more with the first area of bloodborne (and stopped playing the game shortly afterwards) than with the entirety of Sekiro. They’re two very different games, and Sekiro is honestly way more intuitive.
        I guess I need to watch other people play the game on Youtube or something to get the mechanics a little better. I've played 3rd person hack and slash games like this before and had no problem (GOW3, for instance). Is there a trick besides rolling around indefinitely until an open window to slash emerges? I guess I don't understand the intricacies of battle yet (if there are any?). Roll, hit, roll, hit gets boring to me so fast that I let my defenses down for a second and I die. Kind of weird to have no checkpoints or save locations until you beat all of the level and the level boss...
            [deleted]
            From Software games are not like God of War 3 at all. Their combat is far more tactical, requiring knowledge of enemy movesets and a feel for their timing.

Sekiro requires you to know enemy moves and their counters, and has 4 different basic defensive mechanics that you have to choose from at any given moment. Those are blocks, deflects, dodges, and jumps. Each defensive option has a counter, so none serve as a crutch. In order to survive you have to learn how to use them and be skilled enough to execute what you've learned.

The least-fun part of these games in my opinion is the learning part. You have to learn how to beat the game through trial and error. This is why dying is common. Different enemies and bosses require different strategies to beat and some of them are not obvious.

**I highly recommend watching YouTube videos on how to beat bosses you get stuck on.** I try to only look at those resources if I am out of ideas on how to evade a specific attack; learning the game is ultimately very rewarding so I recommend trying your damnedest to limit outside resources.
    >Not really interested in spending 60 bucks to just die constantly and not progress whatsoever.

Then you'll find no enjoyment here.
    I've platinumed both games, and I can tell you it's *much* harder, faster and punishing than Bloodborne. Especially frustrating is the fact that on Ps4 performance makes a big difference. Frames can dip during boss fights, and while its not single digits its enough to change the tight timing and get you hit. When most bosses 1 or 2 shot you, that's pretty infuriating. I tried it on PC afterward and the consistency of combat was wildly improved and much less frustrating.

Dont get me wrong, I like the game. But it's definitely much worse (relative to your question) than Bloodborne.
    I found Sekiro substantially more difficult than any of the Souls games or Bloodborne. While Sekiro is fundamentally different from Souls/Bloodborne, I do feel that it is harder, and thus I would beat Bloodborne before looking at Sekiro. If you're struggling with Bloodborne and getting frustrated, Sekiro would be... miserable.

All the aforementioned games are similar in that they won't let you progress until you get good enough to do so. Throwing yourself at a fight over and over again won't guarantee you a win eventually; you need to be actively considering why you died and making adjustments to try and account for it.
        Okay so besides roll, hit, roll, hit, what are the tactics?
            You don't have a stamina meter and all blocks block all physical damage, you can block through just about everything. Instead of stamina you (and enemies) have posture which increases as you block and get hit. This posture regerates slower as you (and enemies) lose hp. This makes the combat much more dynamic and forces "realistic" sword fights where you are trading blows, blocking, deflecting, and staying in each other's faces. Dodge roll is much worse than it was in DS/bb. Still great but not your number 1 defense. The trick to this game like the others is having the patience to learn. If you refuse to take the time to learn to stomp every enemy you see, two random dudes will still kill you. It takes me 20+ tries on a boss to beat them, but each death is "progress" as you learn even if you don't progress the story.
    I can say that I have 2 friends that have the same experience with the souls games as you. They couldn't really figure out Bloodborne or any of the dark souls series. Both of them are close to finishing Sekiro and they have loved every part of it.

This game is much more forgiving to new players. The sneaking mechanic makes world exploration much easier, the resurrection system makes it much easier and less frustrating to learn bosses, and there are "easy" ways to beat bosses as long as you pay attention to what the game is telling you.
I love how the guy in the back is like, "Should I attack now? Oh wait, he's busy stabbing my buddy to death, it's impolite to strike while the player is busy, I'll just wait back here, okay he's done, here I go!"
    It's a bit silly but it has to be done. If not, you'd either be vulnerable during deathblows, which wouldn't be fun since you lose control during them, or you'd be invulnerable, but the opponents would be swinging at you and clearly hitting you, yet not dealing any damage.

The way the opponents sorta take a step back during the dealthblow animations is ultimately a good design choice, and it's less immersion-breaking/frustrating than the alternatives. Plus canonically you can justify it as the dude being somewhat taken aback that his bro was just disemboweled before his eyes.
    In this game those moments are more exception rather than rule. Most if the time they will fuck you with a loaded howitzer from behind even though you're busy deflecting his friend. You are invulnerable during "death blow" animations though, since you can't react then.
10 hours in, nothing has clicked for me yet. Sekiro is the first FromSoftware game to frustrate me to the point of not wanting to play anymore.
    You might be playing it like it was Dark Souls, or you're relying on stealth too much.

Get in there and deflect every attack that is deflectable, lay off the dodge button.
    It took me until like the 3rd to last boss for it to finally click, so dont feel too discouraged. I fucking hated this game early on, particularly because the first few bosses are by far the most bullshit. But once it clicked I was addicted and kept going through to platinum it ---- and I'm fucking terrible. This game is *all* about posture and deflection. Most bosses I kill are at like 80% health but get posture broken for the deathblow. To keep it somewhat concise:

*  Try to time your deflects perfectly, so you dont take posture damage. Theres multiple deflect timings, and you'll need to recognize the best ones. Blocking outright builds up the meter and will break your guard. Pay attention to the different sounds and sparking effects, they matter. 
*  Many bosses are designed to force you to learn the combat system. Whether by being vulnerable to deflects, or aggression, or something else, always try to see what they're teaching you to master. All these techniques add up to a final boss fight that uses them all.
*  Watch your posture meter closely. If it's building up too fast, hold Block so it goes down faster so you can continue to block and deflect.
*  Don't get greedy with your swings. If a boss or enemy gives you an opening, get your 1-2 hits in and back off. Also, *do not spam attacks*. The game has an input buffer so it'll keep going and locking you into swings when youre trying to dodge. Make sure your swings are deliberate.
*  Know when the enemy has blocked you and when they *deflected* your attack. Sekiro will stumble a bit more, this is your time to deflect because they're about to return a swing.
*  Lower health = much slower posture recovery. Keep yourself at >75% if possible. This applies to bosses as well. Their posture will get easier and easier to break as you whittle their health down, allowing for a deathblow. There's a guy on here who beat the final boss (a pretty long fight) in just over a minute with nothing but a handful of deflections and posture punishments. 
*  Practicing on Hanbei is underrated. It really lets you work out timings.
* Red alert kanji = either a thrust, a sweep or a grab. You'll need to see the enemy stance and move accordingly since many times 1 setup will be followed with different attacks. For stabs, *always* mikiri counter. For sweeps, jump. For grabs, pray and try to dodge at the last second so tracking doesnt kill you. Dodging sucks in this game, and jumping is barely better. So try to deflect as much as possible - including things you wouldnt expect to work.


All in all it eventually settles into a back-and-forth attacking rhythm, and while there's still plenty of frustration even for someone who gets the system it's enjoyable for sure. Again, I'm terrible at this game but if even I can Platinum it then there's hope for anyone.

Edit: Woah, gold? Thank you kind stranger. I wouldve worded this better had I known someone would spend their money on my post.
    Block more. You can get away with spamming block to get occasional deflects, you'll start to get a feel for timing using that as a baseline.
        I'm all for blocking more, but I wouldn't spam it. Try and time your block with the attack, but aim on the early side rather than the late side. If you don't immediately trigger a deflection, just keep holding the block button down and block the incoming attack. Make note of when the attack actually connected, and use that to adjust your timing for next time.
    The >!Genichiro!< fight is what forced me to git gud and everything started clicking (probably not too far from where you are). You have to learn to stop playing it like a Souls game and parry damn near everything. Constantly dodging will very rarely win you a fight. Also learn the posture mechanic - it's key for getting deathblows on bosses and tough enemies. I didn't know for a long time that you can hold block to regain posture faster or that posture recovers slower with low health (for both you and enemies).

Also, use stealth whenever you can. You can often run away from groups of enemies and cheese them after they de-aggro you with a stealth blow to pick them off. And you can sometimes get a free deathblow on bosses/mini bosses by sneaking up on them.

Early on, if a boss fight seems too hard, you can always try and go to a different area to get more prayer beads or other power ups that can make all of the difference.
I want that game so much
He is the One.
I guess I still need to learn to appreciate this game. I'm one of those assholes that never blocks/parries in souls games.
From Software's character animations look both amazing and janky as all hell. 

But the final product is a damn masterpiece.
Now this would make an amazing shinobi movie!

Awesome capture mate.....
That first duck was beautiful
I'm so not there yet.
I have no idea where this it but I’m already dreading going there.
I really want to try this game but don't know if I can stick with it.
    You’re gonna find a guy in the hub area called Hanbei the undying.

He lets you practice the combat on him for free with no consequences.

USE HIM.
    Hop onto steam, buy it, play for less than two hours. If you like it, keep it, otherwise refund it with no questions asked
    I pick it up and put it down.  It's not bad for that.  Beating a boss is great, but it means you have a new hill to climb, so easy to just put off without bad feelings.
Watching this while listening to The Bygone Days from Porco Rosso and it just clicked perfectly. Nice.
NG+4 currently for me
I think these guys would have more success if they used the sword in their hands.
    Believe me their kicks are worse than their swords
Now I want them to add slomo fighting ability.
I think im going to buy this now
He missed 1 parry, -5 points. Jk, looks pretty cool still xD
This is the exact felling when you get into the zone in a game. MAGNIFICENT!
Well I could be that good too if it was in slow mo >.> :P
This is that moment in the Matrix huh??
Is this after the 8th, or 88th time they killed you?
Man I hate those big sparkle effects that block out the details of your moves.
*sad broke boi noises*
 Can not wait to play this game just got breath of the wild so it will be a bit
How is this game? Was thinking about picking it up.
    Incredible if you're willing to learn the combat mechanics and learn from mistakes
I would have died 6 times in this video
I need a sekiro edit
I astral projected into a state of pure bliss watching this. I fucking hate these guys
you can duck under kicks?
Jesus Christ calm down Neo
Boy does this make me feel bad about myself
Just out of curiosity. Has anyone here played monster hunter before? How hard is it to parry compared to something like guard pointing with a chargeblade?
    I play MH, but never really liked CB. Parrying in Sekiro is SOMEWHAT easy. It's literally just hit block the instant you're about to get hit. The difficulty comes from recognizing the couple attacks that cant be parried, or keeping rhythm with multiple fast attacks. If you can Guard Point, you can parry easily.
        Interesting. I guard point almost all the time in monster hunter. I might want to give this game a try...
These guys sure kick alot for someone who carries a sword around.
Thus reminding me that I suck at this game
This is some Hollywood choreography right here
this game looks super sick, might pick it up for PS4 over PC, any thoughts on PC vs PS4 for it?

    Theyre not as difficult as him thankfully. Less moves and health and posture as you could imagine
Lol I have to Say that it really looks sick, almost like a action film. Love It
I like how each game has a different approach to your role in combat. In Dark Souls you're a hero. A big guy in big armor. You can shield a hit, or eat it with poise and go for a counter.

In Bloodborne, you're a hunter. You prepare, take what the beast is weak to, use poisons and buffs to get an edge, and dodge attacks, weaken it, before going for the kill.

In Sekiro, you're a swordsman. Your sword is your shield. Dodging is usually pointless, you must counter every attack, bring your enemy to their knees, and execute them.
I gotta fight two of em at once soon?
Fuuuuuuuuuuuck.

First game I've ever 100% on steam. Took me 4 playthroughs for a total of 80 hours. Spent a long time frustrated trying to beat Seven Spears. Once I beat him my approach to combat had changed considerably and yeah, everything clicked.
Did you seriously just duck that kick by entering and leaving stealth?
I choose to believe this is peak human performance.

As an attack comes your way the world seemingly slows down so you have a moment to react.

I really love this game. I was so bad for the first 15-20 hours. But now that I get it, definitely want to replay it. Makes me want to replay nioh as well.
After having way too much trouble with the first boss, I gave this one up.  

I know, learn to play...

Dude. I'm on my second playthrough, and it's just... a different game. It honestly felt more like a chore than a game, first time around.

This time, I just straight up 1-shot Lady Butterfly. After 30+ tries I cheesed her on my first playthrough. Feels real good to see how much I've improved.
Impressive! Just wondering what did you use to edit the video?
Now that I've finished all my endings in sekiro, I'd love a slowmo mod
Oh fuck I only just managed to beat the first one you meet early on guarding the Raven prosthetic, now you're telling me there's going to be two of these guys?

:(

At the end there, one of the enemies strafed to approach the player from behind their ally as the player killed the ally. Was that intentional on behalf of the enemy ai?
I love how all the hit boxes in this game are super precise. His first move wasnt even a dodge, he just changed into the stealth stance, but since the hit boxes are really accurate, he was not damaged. 10/10 game
Reminds me of metal gear when everything goes slow mo and you see some cool cqc action
That gameplay is crazy satisfying to watch.
how close is this game to ninja gaiden 2?
I saw a clip of afro fighting two apes and now I'm reconsidering getting the game.

Damn I love this game, and did he just straight use crouch in the beginning lol
@sunhilegend on Twitter is the source, fyi. The guy does awesome footage like this for all kinds of action games. Including Bloodborne.
Oh my god.. You have to fight two of those guys at once???  I could barely kill the first one!

I would expect the skill shots to be slow-mo. This feels backwards.
Was going to buy this game in sale. This does not make me want to wait though.
Someone buy a poor student Sekiro as a grad present <3.

Nah im jk, cant wait to play this once i start working again 😍. From soft games are my favourite games.

Awesome, first time I ran into one of those at the pagoda it wiped the floor with me. Found turning off auto lock makes things waaay easier.
Not familiar with this game. Are the two in purple NPCs? If so I think that's the first time I've ever seen NPCs double teaming and actually knowing how to fight a double team instead of either standing idly by or everyone just hitting you at once.
"When you go ultra instinct"
How did you do the duck under the kick?
[Prototype OST - Memory In Death](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mn9hz8KBMz0) makes this so epic. Also kind of edgy, but that's fine :)
Mr.Anderson became Neo.
The other fucker just used his buddy's dead corpse as a view blocker for a surprise attack.
Cue an army of whining fans slamming you for using slow down mods.
I'm at the beginning of game... stuck on the chained ogre... and you guys are fighting multiple purple Ryu's from Ninja Gaiden on NES simultaneously.
This looked like a fucking dororo fight
Its crazy to think that this is just normal gameplay. But it looks insane slowed down.
I think I'm going to purchase this game just off the strength of this sequence.  This looks wholly satisfying.
Is the slowing down part of the gamebor a mod to make it easier?
Haha fuck yeah man, those interior ninjas are pretty badass

This is how I was in the rematch against Owl in the burning flames of hiratas estate
I just clicked and we were going back and forth attacking and deflecting, dodging his explosion and countering his massive thrust attack
Such a good game
Really rewarding, and the tools are so much fun

Is this game easy to play on PC wit a keyboard or is a controller recommend
This is beautiful. Fucking awesome game.
And people think the combat is bad. It makes you feel like such a bad ass.
this was cool
Neo? Is that you?
I am waiting on grabbing this game because I know it’s going to piss me off to no end, but this makes me want to play it now. Very cool.
Sekiro: Enter the matrix.
Fantastic. That 'click' is so uplifting. You go from gutter trash to demigod in a moment. Well, at least I went from gutter trash to something more respectable.
I have no real interest in brutal, kick to the balls difficult games like Dark Souls. Mostly because I don't have the time or the patience for them. But I'm very tempted to make an exception for Sekiro.
90% of enemies weakness is R1 spam. except these fuckers
Take my upvote sir.
wow that game looks crazy 😯
Okay, that was really impressive.
Omae was mou shindeiru.
That's the most 'Anime' shit I've ever seen
I'm trying to find a YouTuber who plays this game with this level of skill. Any recommendations? Equivalent to DMC 5 SSS bullying Vergil. Probably one of the most impressive videos iv seen if you haven't.. https://youtu.be/i_84BafqQ4I
what anime is this?
Smooth
I just don't know what to do. I was really frustrated by Bloodborne, never really played Dark Souls. But I LOVE samurai/Japanese period games...reddit, do I get this game or not? Is it a bit more accessible than the other games?
Having this slowed down just gives me even more appreciation for the amazing animation in this game. Look at the way Wolf changes his grip after the deathblow. So fucking cool!
Dammmmmmn!!!!!!!!
Damn, it even looks like the other baddie tried to take advantage of his buddy dying by hiding behind the  body to attack
Got gud.

I like how the Npc goes behind his dead bro and attack as soon as the body drops.
Does anyone know if this was recorded at 60fps and slowed down? I can't imagine how they could have recorded at faster than 60, but the slow motion is pretty impressive.
Pretty sure I saw this on a episode of the Simpson's a few years back.. they really do predict everything.
There is a point where you have to fight TWO of these one armed animals?! I'm still busy trying to figure out a way to get my first one to half health ffs!
How are you slowing time?
This game is just fantastic
Practicing with the purple cloaks can make you git gud. They are my favorite opponents.
How is this in slo-mo? Modded?
When you git gud
I’ve not played or followed this game. I don’t intend to play it as I don’t have the patience. But my word is it beautiful
This is the kind of stuff I want to see happening in full-dive VR games once we create the technology to make a brain-machine interface and make video games for it.
Don't mean to be a negative nancy, but i really don't like the sparks effect. Seems like they're trying a shortcut to animating the some of the epic swordplay. I haven't played this game yet  but would those who have agree?
Still looks epic
    not really, in motion it flows well, the sparks are a way of knowing wether your parry worked or not
Muda muda muda
Why do suck so bad at this game
I feel this is what Witcher 3 combat should have been. Not swinging untill the enemy breaks but more of exploiting weaknesses with precise timing and accurate blows.
They really did take the Souls games and make it a better and more offensive style of game, IMO. Congrats dude, because you achieved Mastered Ultra Instinct right here.
Exactly!
video source?
these gifs are awesome. do you got any more of this...stuff?
....he is the one.
I'd love to see a TAS run of this game.

HYUT TUT TUT TUT TUT TUT TUT TUT UHH
That is the real beauty of these games.  It has felt really good since Bloodborne, where you feel like the choice of attack and timing can tuck you between their blows and connect with your own.
    Or you spam the Axe's charge R2 constantly and recover all HP after being hit lol
        that was the reason why bloodborne felt so easy for me compared to the other games. if charged enough other attacks can't interrupt you and any damage you receive gets healed instantly. also it staggers or knocks most enemies. the game basically became an R2 simulator for me.
            Well, the Axe is the easiest weapon, Ludwig is a close second. The game is completely different played with a whip, a katana or a boom hammer.
                Damn I only play with the threaded cane. Was my first weapon I used and no matter how many times I say I’m going to play with the rapier gun I always end up with the threaded cane.
                    Probably because it's a starting weapon, and you go in with the intent of playing a skill build. You get a few hours in and suddenly you have a +6 or +9 cane and you're just going to switch weapons? No way in hell!

That's always been a criticism I have had of the souls games, sometimes you just have to wait too long to get the weapon you want.

Boss weapons in the first DS for example. I have to get all the way to the Giant in Anor Londo before I can even think about boss weapons? Fuck that.

It's especially bad in Bloodborne because you almost never find weapons barring a few exceptions. There are also tons of extra gates to quickly obtaining them.
                    Put on my top hat.

Light my cane on fire.

Bathe in the blood of beasts.
            My first playthrough I fell into that habit and didn't realize how much I relied on just powering through hits then healing then my next playthrough I tried to use Dex and the katana and got my shit pushed in, lol.
r/hitboxporn
Souls since Bloodborne has managed to have both the best and worst hitboxes of any games. You get stuff like this where the animation of your attack will make your character duck and go right under an enemy's attack or something like that, and then other times when you get grabbed an entire body length outside of what looks like the enemy's reach.
    The hit boxes are amazing, you're just failing to realize every mob who grabs have giant invisible magnets tiesd to their hands... And you're made of metal but you just don't know it.
        That seems to be in every game.  I hate grab attacks.  The Ninja Gaiden remakes were a pretty good example of why they're awful... you fight a boss, and it has, say, six attacks.  Five of them are blockable, fairly easy to dodge, and inflict a mild to moderate amount of damage when they hit, with the sixth being a grab attack which is unblockable, has minimal telegraphing, is very difficult to dodge, can hit you from practically anywhere on the screen, and takes off 80% of your health.

Although that's more extreme than most games, it's a similar issue in almost every game they appear, with the added 'bonus' of locking you into an overly long animation which, if you're lucky, you'll be forced to mash buttons to get out of it.  Dead Rising is particularly fun, since every enemy does an overly long grab attack!

It usually just feels like a mechanic thrown in to make things harder.  It's funny how an attack which is supposed to be point blank range, and often done by slow moving enemies is almost always the most dangerous attack they can do.
You can also jump over many low sweep attacks and kick the enemy in the face.
I was super impressed with thr hitbox during the lady butterfly fight. After hitting her 4 times she'll high kick, and I used the sweeping slash thing and just ducked under her kick and got 2 hits in for my efforts. It was so cool
The game really has amazing hitboxes.
    Pretty great what you can do when there's no consideration for online interaction. You can make the hitboxes basically as detailed as you want.
I just assume that everything has a huge hitbox so a high kick would hit a crouching player or something. I would never have tried it otherwise.
This is why these games are always on r/hitboxporn
Yup, same instinct here.

That instinct means you die horrendously multiple times over.

Being prudent and blocking is wonderful, but a skill beyond me.
I was teaching a friend how to play Bloodborne and I was explaining the importance of dodging. She didn't even look at me and said, "I don't dodge."

I laughed and said, "Haha funny, but seriously, you have to dodge."

"I told you, I don't dodge. It's not something I do."

I didn't know how to respond.
    This made me laugh out loud,  I had a friend I tried to teach mortal combat too, told him he needs to block- same response, same reaction lol
        I played MK since I bought MK1 on 3 floppy disks a long time ago. I pretty much only played that and I believe i was good at it. I practiced on the PC and dominated arcades. Around mk3 time I was at a friend's house and he had a few friends I didn't know there too. Everyone was saying one of them played really well. I remembered being excited to play against him. According to him, his tactic was to overwhelm the opponent by going full aggro and attack at all times. When we faced each other I noticed he really never blocked, ever. This was new to me, took me a couple of rounds to adjust to that but after, it was super predictable. I just dodged or blocked, countered and easily won. I was so disapointed.
However, there was another dude there who I also didn't know and barely spoke. First few rounds and I got my arse handed to me on a platter. Mf was a sleeper, no one even had any idea the guy was a fucking beast. Took me a few rounds to adjust but after that we had some pretty epic fights. I still recall to this day, I really REALLY enjoyed fighting that guy. Was the first time I actually experienced the joy of playing vs a good opponent.

Few years later, I had moved on to unreal tournament. I had a pretty good PC and I practiced a lot so I was pretty decent. We hosted lan parties at my place where everyone brought their crt monitors and desktops, network cables everywhere (wifi was a lie at the time), etc. This one time someone brought along this guy who had moved in nearby recently. The guy was a bit shy but he was easily keeping up with me in scores and I'm thinking wow this guy is a great opponent, around my level. After a few rounds I pass my seat to someone else and go watch him play on his PC. My jaw hit the floor. This mf is playing on a super shit computer, shit graphics, really low fps (like 10-20?), a tiny monitor, the crappiest 2€ mouse, etc. His setup was really bad compared to mine and yet he was easily keeping up with me. Immediately thought, fuck, this guy is not as good as me, this guy is ages better than me. It was me who needed a good computer to keep up with him. Should this guy ever play on a decent machine he would own me so bad. I wasn't wrong. I helped him improve his PC to decent levels and that guy was a beast, I got better but was never as good as him.

He's one of my best friends now and he's a raw gem. I saw him play a shitton of games over the years. I played many with him. There was never a game he was bad at, didn't really matter which.  He has a natural talent to quickly figure and be genuinely good at any game he plays. It's pretty ridiculous and I admire him a ton for that. If he was born a few years later into this era of esports I'm sure he'd be super famous. 
Shooting people in a computer wasn't real enough for him at one point so he went to airsoft. He now plays with military people who do it to practice war scenarios and he is very good at it from what I'm told. 
Man, I miss playing against him now lol.

Ops, sorry for the text wall. Your comment brought up some really good memories that I felt like taking about :)
            No need to apologize, gaming is nostalgic for me too (I'm sure most gamers could agree)! I'm glad my comment was able to evoke that from you,  it was fun to read your experience.
        All I could think of was the opening to Bioshock Infinite, "He doesn't row."
            "No, no. I said he ***doesn't*** row."   
"Ah."
    Did she get very far?..
        No.

No, she did not.
    Well then this game is probably more her speed, I had a hard time with it until I unlearned my bloodborne ways and stopped dodging.
I wonder if we had played fewer games and had fewer button memories we would be better at this ... most of the time I simply forget what does what.
    >most of the time I simply forget what does what.

Been playing video games since childhood. I obviously KNOW where my buttons are. However, this is me, Every. Quick. Time. Event. Ever.
No matter what, I panic and I freeze and then I just digress to more primitive gaming instincts. So odd, really quite baffling to me.
        Sounds like you could use some cognitive training. That might sound weird, but it can kind of be viewed as a stat our brain has. A game like starcraft 2 can help you grind it <3
> smash every button on my controller.

I mean if this were actual Sekiro he would be constantly hitting the attack button in a correct pattern. You always want to be executing an action in Sekiro, misses are not punished like a souls game.

Always attack if you're able to.
    Kinda... the game does reward being on the offense a lot more than other souls games, but I think the biggest part is switching between offensive and defensive play. Always attacking is going to get you killed real fast. Its about knowing when the right time to apply pressure is, and pushing that until the enemy recovers and pushes back, in which case you need to play defensively again.
        While that sounds really impressive and all, it really just boils down to attack until the enemy perfect deflects YOU. That's your cue to switch gears. That's it. This remains true for about all regular enemies while some bosses are a bit trickier.
            Right tell me how to beat that raging fucking bull then
                Run behind it. Like, hold the run button and and constantly get in that ass.
                Use the firecracker tool. You'll note the description says it "scares beasts." Unless it's in the middle of some animations (or possibly there is a x-many-seconds cooldown, not sure), a firecracker will cause the bull to stop and rear up, letting you rush in and deal a bit of damage.   

Also, jump toward it and to the side when it's charging if you need to dodge. Enemies in this game often seem to have [Dark Souls 2](http://cdn.themis-media.com/media/global/images/library/deriv/722/722390.jpg) magnetism on many of their attacks. As such, Dodging is frequently worthless. Or it may just have very narrow windows in which to be effective. Either way, you're definitely better off jumping against this guy.
                    Your exanarion of the busted dodging is a perfect summary. And it explains why I'm so stuck on madam whatsherface and the bull. 2 where you evidently need to be good at dodging lol
                        No, it’s no about being good at dodging. Stop dodging. Learn to deflect. Deflect is your dodge button now. Dodge is your get killed button. You’re better off holding down that dodge button and sprinting away from an enemy 99% of the time rather than dodging.
                        If you would like some help with that, I can give you some tips. If not, stop here. 

If Lady Butterfly is giving you trouble, start by learning to disengage. Just straight up run away. (Unless she's doing her big flying perilous attack, in which case run toward her.) Just keep an eye on her to block her ranged attacks just in case and run full tilt towards whichever is the far end of the room. Once you learn how far her attack combos go, you can run *just* outside of range and then turn and get in a couple punishing hits. 

Shuriken is fairly good at knocking her out of flying attacks, but I preferred to save my Spirit Emblems for the second phase. If you can't seem to get her dead, try coming back once you have the Umbrella tool and the Projected Force skill. Don't bother with snap seeds. You *want* her to have all her summons up, then just run around until she dismisses them into homing projectiles. Position yourself by a pillar to block a handful of them so as not to break your posture, but tank the brunt of them with the Umbrella up. Get close to her, and the Projected Force attack will knock like 1/5 of her HP off.
                            Thanks for the tips! I'll try to worm on these as we as using the firecracker tool better
                Dont chase its butt.  Chasing butt is for hacks.

Wait for the bull to charge, and perfect parry when it runs straight at you head first.  You literally knock it on its ass and open it up to getting sliced and diced.
                    Everyone who comments any other strategy than this one is wrong, and is doing it wrong, and is wasting theirs and your time. Parry that knockup head attack, get in 2-3 slices, back up and do it again. Throw in some firecrackers for extra hits. After about 5 parries, you'll fill his posture bar at only about half his vitality.
                    WHAT?! The parry knocks it down?? I must have never had a successful parry on it then...
                        It only knocks it down on certain attacks.  The key to the bull is to get some space and parry the attack when he runs at you, dips his head, and then tries to gore you.  It's easy as hell to parry and knocks him down.

The "stay behind the bull" people are giving you bad advice.  It's possible to do it that way, but it's way harder and it's teaching you bad habits for the rest of the game.  Parry >>>> dodging when possible for every single fight in the game except for one optional boss at the very end.
                Well, apart from gimmick bosses like that I'm referring to anything with a sword (or spear). But as for the raging bull in particular, try pretending you're a bullfighter :)
        Dark souls is basically a very slow dance of doge attack, dodge dodge dodge attack. This game has a different rythm to it, a lot of the time its block block attack attack attack, block (for a while) then back into attack. There's a dancing of being in defence to a very sudden attack pattern and like you said, they push back eventually so you need to go back to defence, It took me a while to get the rhythm down but I eventually died. I'm pretty sure I ready somewhere that the bosses in the game work on a certain metronome rhythm, if you play that tick-tock sound you know when there's another attack coming.
        Rushing is a form of hesitation, and hesitation is defeat, right?
Do you want to die? Because that's how you die.
    Finally, I have the answer I’ve been searching for!
I’m just starting to get over that, after getting killed like twenty times in a row and realizing button mashing the counter button wasn’t gonna work no matter how many times I tried.
Sekiro combat rules 101:
Kick=dodge
Spear = kick (it's a specific counter)
Sword=counter

If u do any of these for a different one you are going to have a bad day.
    [deleted]
My first instinct after years of Dark Souls is to dodgeroll everything. That’s not how to play Sekiro.
My problem with these games is always more about the navigation than the fighting. I’m bad at the fighting but I could power through if I had a better idea of my goal.
    You and me both, buddy.
    I don't know, this game is pretty damn linear if you just read the dialogue. If you straight up follow the story to the first ending its like 15 hours long.
        33 minute speedrun would like a word

But yeah, to play the game as intended you're right haha
            That record (which is now sub 27) uses a number of exploits, along with taking the shortest ending. Most people are going to run into the Immortal Severance ending with is considerably longer. Just doing that ending with no exploits is over an hour speed running IIRC.
        I'm at the monkeys with 32hours on it ... :'(
            I was also at the monkeys at roughly 30 hours in. I took my time exploring every little crevice though.
                I just beat monkeys 10 minutes ago at 28 hours. Kinda funny we all took roughly the same amount of time to get there even though I'm sure we all have different amounts of different areas explored. Neat that the game branches out and pretty much lets you do whatever until you're happy to continue the plot.

/u/Lorithias: Kill the brown monkey before finishing the headless chap. He's considerably weaker and then you can focus 1v1 again.
    Just gotta explore. Having a hard time somewhere? Look somewhere else. After awhile go back and give it another try. Sekiro is fairly linear but if you’re really stumped there’s no harm in checking a guide.
    Your goal is to exhaust all options until you can proceed. My problem is that it is one uphill battle after another.
    I find this one's a lot nicer to you than Dark Souls where you're just told you have to link the fire and a general instruction on how to do it or Bloodborne where the only guidance you have is "end the nightmare".

in Sekiro, someone's telling you what you have to do and it's pretty linear.  The first part is "save the heir" and you know he's in the castle and that's the only way to go.
    This is a common complaint and I totally understand.  Moving from point A to point B without knowing where the fuck point B even is or how to get there infuriates a lot of people, but that process of trial and error is precisely what some people like me love so much.  To each his own.  I obsess over these games and wish all my friends loved them as much as me, but I totally get it
    Sekiro is way more linear and less confusing to navigate through than Dark Souls.
    This game has frustrated me so much because of not being sure where I'm supposed to be going. Two specific times in the game (one early on, the other right near the end) I reach a boss that gives me extreme, unbelievable trouble (first Lady Butterfly, and later the Demon of Hatred) where I run into a wall dying over and over and over, only to give up and look them up on the wiki and find out that they're an optional fight and I could have just gone down a different path I didn't even know was there. This is a perfect example of why the game's difficulty (and it reputation for such) is a detriment to the gaming experience- in another game you'll reach a brick wall boss and think "Oh, I'm supposed to come back later", but in this game, there's no way of knowing if I'm supposed to come back later or if I'm just supposed to git gud and power through it.
        This is an odd thing. If you can't do something, you go and explore. That's video games 101. Has been forever.
        Based on what your saying, if you treated it like a normal game then you would be fine. Can’t beat this boss? Go explore. It makes the game way easier as you get more skills and more health. I went to Lady Butterfly and immediately left to go explore more of the game and came back with twice the amount of health and posture, making the fight way easier. I’m pretty sure there was another point where I had an option of three different main bosses because I had decided to go kill all the mini bosses in their areas first, making all the main bosses easier.
        Then Lobosjr beats it no damage, level 1, naked. 3 days after the game comes out.
        There’s always other paths to explore though. When I struggle with a boss, I go explore another area that I haven’t explored yet.

Eventually I might hit multiple walls, but by that point I end up beating one of the bosses I struggled with preciously. 

That being said though, this game definitely lacked direction more than other FS games imo. I discovered The Monks and ashina depths before even beating Genichiro for example lol.
            I think discovering Monks and Depths is totally legit before fighting Genichiro. Recommended in one sense with how much it helps you upgrade skills and collect prayer beads. That’s the way I went!

In general, I think Sekiro encourages the player to explore and beat mini bosses for beads before taking on main bosses.
        If you run into a wall, no reason to keep hitting. Up until the very end of the game, there's _always_ two or three various paths you can go down at any time. It's an incredibly open game and can be tackled in a ton of various orders. There's very few spots where it's "You're meant to go this way, and then this way." Every route as harder and easier spots, and you're meant to go down which ever way you choose, or even go down one area a bit, back and then another for a bit, and then back, whatever. 

Try not to think of it like "what's the way I'm supposed to go right now" and just go wherever you're feeling like.
        I really couldn’t disagree more. Both of those instances are clearly optional if you’re paying attention to what the npcs are telling you. Even if you find the bell from the lady first, the sculptor tells you where you goal actually is. The entire way to DoH is optional because, again, they tell you exactly where your destination is and how to get there. This tells me you didn’t listen to the characters and just spammed past their dialogue.
        It's pretty much a hallmark of this studio that their games don't explain much of anything and then punish you for not knowing what was never explained.
            Definitely; but since every interview and review insisted that this game was NOT a soulsborne, I had no way of knowing whether this game would be the same in that regard.
I've tried and failed to beat lady butterfly for 3 days now.
    Shurikens, snap seeds
        Also just getting a small amount of damage on her really impacts her posture recovery speed. From there you can pretty much just parry everything and she dies. No need to worry too much about anything besides staying alive once you've hit her 3 or 4 times.   
Still not nearly as easy as just shooting a bunch of shurikens up her ass when shes jumps onto a wire, but much more satisfying when you get the kill.
    you can cheese her pretty hard on the first part. If you have the art that closes distance (i forget what it's called, but it's a jumping flip forward).

two attacks, then the jump and she'll be caught in an endless loop.

In the second phase, whenever she does her illusion thing, just run in a circle around the arena until they're gone, but other than that, this one's harder to cheese.
    instead of sidestepping, you can keep sprinting around her and get a chance to attack. She cant deflect if you are on her backside. when she is in the air you can use the shuriken to knock her down and charge an attack on her. good luck
[deleted]
    Whos the first boss? Do you mean lady butterfly, gyoubu, or the ogre?
        [deleted]
            The actual bosses do get you to be better at the game, though. Lady Butterfly tip: ignore her illusions and just run around the edge of the arena until she dispels it. Also, Shuriken is godly in that fight.
                It's also far easier to so with another gourd seed and an attack up from the first full boss.  Trying to finish her off first is difficult.  I beat her the second try after coming back then.
                I found out last night when I finally managed to beat her that you can stop her from ever summoning the illusions if you keep pressure on her all through the second phase. She always appears by the big statue after the first deathblow so you can just run over and wait for her to appear and start attacking her before she even has a chance to do anything.
                    I tried doing that, but she would always jump and summon before I could close the gap. Did you corner lock her or something?
                        Now that I think about it I did push her back towards the statue each time so she didn't have far to run for that initial attack. I just stayed glued to her the entire time and she generally acted like she did in the first phase, but with the butterflies added in. The only time she managed to get off the summon after I started being so aggressive was when I'd jump away to heal.

Granted, I the only reason I was able to get so aggressive was because I practically memorized her patterns after days of dying over and over haha
                            Sounds like my experience with Genichiro. If that battle taught me anything, it was “don’t panic” and “for the love of god, the ogre should have taught you this, DON’T GET GREEDY!”
                You can also run around and occasionally hit the illusions at opportune times, which one shots them and replenishes shuriken charges
            You're there a bit too early if this is your first boss.

Should've fought the horseman first.
                MY NAME IS GYUBO ONIWA
                    MY NAME IS GYUBO ONIWA *slashes the horse 5 times*
                        BRAT!
                Oh is Gyubo considered the "first" boss? If that's the case, maybe there's hope for me yet! That's the fight where it first started feeling like I was getting a hang of the game.

I mean, he still kicked my ass a bunch of times, but once I got a good rhythm of deflecting his charges and grappling over the long sweep attack, it actually felt doable. Only had to use the firecrackers twice when I finally beat him!

^^And ^^then ^^the ^^bull ^^made ^^me ^^his ^^plaything...
                    This is kinda what happened to me in dark souls 1. I went to the graveyard with the skeletons right after the tutorial, and kept fighting them until i could kinda kill a couple. Then i was like "fuck me this game isnt just hard its bullshit" then i found the eay to the aquaduct and started killing the undead there like 'oh... thiiiis is the first area'
                        This was me in Dark Souls 2, lol
                            Not trying to be rude, but how? DaS2 starting area leads to 3 different areas, 1 which I'm sure won't find first time as it requires you to have a ton of Health or the ring that nullifies fall damage. So you really only have 2 paths the first time and neither of them leads to a high level area. One leads to the giant boss and the other to the big guy with armor (forgot it's name) and neither of them are hard or at least not late into the game hard. The guy with armor in particular, you can bait him and he'll kill himself by falling off the platform lol.
                                Probably Dragonrider area I’m guessing. I didn’t find it very hard either but the forest of giants is much easier to fight some easy enemies and level up a bit. The giant soldiers can be really aggravating if you’re new to the series.
                    The real bosses drop memories. Mini bosses drop prayer beads.
                        Except for the anomaly of Headless Ape which gives 2 prayer beads and a memory.
                        ah, that's an easy distinction to remember. thanks!
                    I'm with you on all this. That bull fight was stupid.
                        Bull fight was a game changer. I had to rework my entire playstyle around the douche. I ended up using all my gourds, pellets, and rez to get that bastard down on the 5th go. The wiki really helped me out on the fight as well.
                            I'm back to getting my shit pushed in by Lady Butterfly and Ashina Elite.
                                You can cheese the Elite with the spear if you want.   He can't really deal with it.   Fighting fair is for samurai, not shinobi.
                                Easy strat for the elite: just deflect.

He has this double attack that you can bait if you stay on range. Just spam block once he starts charging it and then back away. 3-4 times and you can finish him. Do that twice and he's dead.

There are multiple bosses in the game in which spamming block and doing nothing else makes the whole fight completely trivial
                    How did you get the firecracker before fighting him???
                        Apparently firecrackers can be bought from the Mob merchant before the ogre, but I never found that the first time through.
                        There's a memorial mob that sells it at the top of a cliff kind of near the old woman that gives you the bell. You have to grapple up to the top.
            It doesn't get easier, but there totally is an "aha" moment in regards to blocking/parrying being insanely powerful.
            My first 15-20 hours of playing, I just got wrecked over and over again, but then it finally 'clicked' for me and the game got a ton more fun.

There were definitely moments where I wasn't sure if I'd ever get good enough to really enjoy the game, but, I did, eventually.
            Lady Butterfly isn't the first boss. Shes an optional side quest boss that's fairly difficult. Come back to her later in the game.
            Butterfly is an optional boss, you actually don't even need to kill her.
            Dodge attack is your best friend, stick with it. We believe in you.
                Specifically for Lady Butterfly that works well. Pretty much every boss has a "simple" way to beat them

&#x200B;

>!Ogre - All of his attacks (except his one "fast" grab) are really really slow, at least by Sekiro enemy standards. He's also really difficult because you lack healing gourds and most people think you \*need\* to get two finisher blows on him unlike most other minibosses where you can get a sneak attack off. You can actually use Gacchin sugar to sneak up on the ogre - or aggro him and then lose aggro and get him much easier after he's broken free.!<

>!Gyoubu - Blocking works really well against him - you don't need to worry much about your posture because he gives you long breaks to recover posture - and a lot of free hits with the grapple-attack (if you have it). Firecrackers help, but definitely not necessary.!<

>!Blazin Bull - Even difficult on new game+, but if you deflect his charge like a matador you can wear his posture down before he kills you. Use dousing powder to keep from burning, and heal up when you get the chance. Also I've watched a lot of people struggle against him on streams/youtube but they don't seem to realize you can stay locked on to him and sprint around, which makes dodging him really really easy.!<

>!Guardian Ape - Pretty tough, since you really need deal a lot of vitality damage to end up beating him - but he has several attacks that leave him open for a few free hits. Also, you can still deflect him - I've seen many people not even try to block or deflect his attacks. They are erratic, but if you're disciplined in holding your block up you shouldn't get surprised too much.!<

>!Guardian Ape (headless) - The freaky factor puts a lot of people off, but his attacks are really telegraphed (easy to deflect or \*at least block\*), and if you can recognize his scream of terror then you shouldn't really even need to use pacifying agents. Also, the loaded spear (i think it's the spiral upgrade) deals massive damage to him if you can get him at the right time.!<

>!Guardian Ape (re-fight) - During the two ape portion of the fight the second ape doesn't attack super often, and it has lower vitality and breaks posture more easily - but if you keep your distance you can still probably take out the headless one and if you do then the second ape dies at the same time.!<

>!Genichiro - Attack when he isn't attacking, and deflect after he \*perfect\* deflects your strike. The timing is fairly easy to learn, and many sworded enemies have the same style where you attack until you get perfect deflected and then switch to something defensive. Deflect his jumping slash and it does a lot of posture damage. His second phase is still pretty tough, but if you can get the lighting reversal down then it's actually a really easy fight. Some of his timing and patterns are a little different, but he has the same basic attack patterns.!<

>!Long-arm centipede - Some people find him really easy but others struggle a ton on him. His flurry is really intimidating, but it only takes like two flurries to get his posture broken, and jump and stomp his head after his sweep for aton of posture damage.!<

Aaand there are others but i'm tired of typing. I'm sure there are better ways to beat them than what I've listed too, which is beautiful.
            Things click eventually, but pace yourself. Sekiro isn't one of these games you play for hours & hours each day (if you have the time in the first place). Understanding parrying & how to counter deathblows is key. 

If you're keen to try Lady Butterfly again there's a very easy tactic that doesn't even use blocking. When she attacks dodge to the right & use the dodge slash, then she'll kick again, dodge to the right & slash, on & on. Since you dodge out of the way she resets her combo & that slow kick is easy to dodge & since you're interrupting an attack from the side you're getting a proper hit in & she's not deflecting or guarding. When she jumps in the air, all you have to do is throw a shuriken & she'll fall on her face allowing you a couple hits.
            Another tip for lady butterfly if no one has said it already. You can get in 2 swings before she counter attacks so the pattern to whittle her posture down is attack attack deflect. Repeat that and pressure her enough to break her posture. If she jumps up Shuriken immediately and repeat if she gets knocked down. It’s all about breaking her posture
                Yet another tip; in phase two you don’t need snap seeds to dispel the illusions - just sprint around the perimeter until they go away!
            Shuriken her in the air, side step to her right. What combat art are you using?
    Horse bro isn’t too hard once you figure out you just have to wait for the grapple indicator for free damage. Can legit just block the rest of his attacks since he runs past you with all of them anyways.
        Also if you figure out the single prosthetic that literally every animal-based boss is vulnerable too, that fight becomes a pretty big joke.
    Which one was that? because a lot of people consider Genichiro the first 'Boss' in the game. Even though you fight a few before him. 

In any case, I hate to sound like a broken record with this comment, but a whole lot of people are treating Sekiro like just another souls game, when it really is a completely different beast. I rage quit Genichiro the first time I fought him too. I literally couldn't understand how people were beating him. I looked up YouTube videos. I read articles. I did everything I could possibly think of to go into that fight with an advantage...and I STILL couldn't beat him. It's cliche, but I literally had to accept the combat system before I even stood a chance. But even after I rage quit, I couldn't help but think about beating him at work the next day. lol

Eventually, the combat just clicked, and I FINALLY beat him. The entire game changed for me after that. It took on a whole new tone and challenge for me. I just fought Genichiro in NG+ yesterday and didn't even break a sweat during the fight. 

It's just like learning the intricacies of Dark Souls and then getting good at that system. It just takes time and an open mind. 

Sorry for the long rant. I just feel like a lot of people who i've talked to about the game have the same mentality towards it.
        Genichiro is the line that divides people who know how to play the game and people who don't.

Later bosses are technically more impressive and difficult, but Genichiro is downright perfect. No tricks, no gimmicks, no cheesing. You just need to be good enough.
            I did lady butterfly first, and she was way harder for me.
        Which is funny... As I thought Genichiro was ridiculously easy for a big fight, and struggled forever on Butterfly.  Each boss has a different rhythm that different people Excel at.  For me Genichiro is exact the type I like, patterned predictable low reaction speed boss.  He hits hard, but easy to wear down (for me, of course).

I also had killed just about every side boss and Lady butterfly before getting to him though...  So I likely had already struggled enough to get good at sword fights.  Spears...  Me and the mekiro counter don't get along.  High reaction speed fights like seven Spears or ashina elite I cheesed through with Spears and axes...
        Same kinds thing happened for me in dark souls, I remember I had spent probably 45 minutes fighting the nameless king on my first playthrough which was just a grind of me throwing myself at him, something clicked and then when I started a new playthrough on ng+ I beat him on the first try. it's so satisfying to see visible improvement in these types of games.
When I first played this game, I found the combat to be boring. But it was my fault because I did not use a single tool or combat art through my whole solid first playthrough.

Idk why...
Not a souls game
Wait. It's a souls game? As in dark souls?
It’s not a souls game.
I've sunk about the same amount of time in and haven't gotten past the Shinobi Hunter soooo... Kudos to you man lol
Help me understand combat.  I suck
[deleted]
    Unsold!
        Lmao
        There are some user made mods, on PC at least, that let you show it down to your level.
            I have old man reflexes, and I get hard stuck on every boss and miniboss. Thanks for the tip. Maybe the 60$ wasn't wasted.
                Yeah I needed to take a break from this game because my old man reflexes just aren't working with this game. i've beaten 2 bosses... out of 13... just the thought of bosses being significantly more difficult than what I've already faced makes me wish I didn't buy the game. But the game is beautifully done... it's just not for us old guys
    How is time slowed then? Is it just slow mo applied to the video, or a cheat?
        Its slowed in post. The game doesn't have 16:9 blackbars either. Whoever made this was trying to make it look cinematic
            They were trying to crop out the UI and figured this was the best way to do it, yeah.
                You can actually turn off the hud in the display settings.
            Judging by how smooth the movement looks when slowed down, I'm going to guess that the game was played and recorded with slowmo cheat, and then sped up in post. Unless it was being run with unlocked frame rate, and hitting a couple hundred FPS
                Pretty sure that the game is capped at 60 even on pc.
                    i think there is mod that unlocks framerate
        There is actually a program out right now that allows you to slow the game and speed up the player. It's as close to an easy mode as you can get for this game.
        Theres a mod which you can use to slow down the animations of the enemies
            You can open the logo in ms paint and write "you win" under it, too
                Idk the name but if you search for the "i beat sekiro with cheats and i feel fine" article mentioned it, u can find it there
    Yep
Gamer ADD ftw!
> I guess I’ll do what I always do, get easily distracted.

Play for 4 hours and then nope the fuck out!
I arrived through the window you leave from at first and was so confused how tf that fight was possible with both the kicky bois.
If it’s the room you’re thinking of with the mini boss, this is a differerent room earlier with the ceiling hole.
Puppeteer the first, let them fight with the 2 blue robed samurai, zip up to the hole in the ceiling, drop down, stealth kill the last one in the next room, and finally return to clean up the previous fight. 

For bonus XP, jump down from the main room and stealth kill the red guard and finish off his buddy standing on the opposite side of the door. 

All in all you're looking at ~6K experience.
Lol ya puppeteer feels like one of the stronger ninjutsus, having a buddy to distract them is a pretty big help.
The ogre’s tracking drop kick is BS.
    Firecrackers make ogre obsolete.
        I just burned the mothafucka
Yeah, except for those grabs and one of the demon of hatreds move, this game has excellent hitboxes.
“Why didn’t you dodge?”

“I did but he has the Force.”
You can jump over guardian apes grab
    It's all good I used the unbeatable strategy on it, worked like a charm
Jackpot!
Tough to answer.

Did you not like Souls games because they were hard? If so, this game is something you need to avoid. It's arguably harder.

If, however, you didn't like Soul's game's combat focus around primarily blocking or rolling, and wanted something a bit more offensive and intense...then this just might be for you.

Also, if you're a lore nut and didn't like Souls games for their obscure lore and lacking a coherent story....well, I won't say that this is an Old-School Bioware RPG, but it definitely tells a more complete story comparatively speaking.
    Yeah the combat in the Soul's games were a bit annoying and repetitive so I didn't like it much. If its fast and upbeat fighting then I think I will like this game. Thanks!
        Ok so, the skill ceiling in this game is quite high. But it *can* feel *very* repetitive early on, when it feels like you're just mashing attack over and over. But in general, the combat is very snappy and quick. A step beyond BB, and way behind Souls, in that regard.
        Not the person you’re speaking too, but the combat is sensational. I will say I’m biased; having played and beat all previous souls games. That being said, if you were a fan of something like ninja gaiden or other oldschool hacknslash action titles and love a brutal challenge, this game is for you!
            ninja gaiden black is one of my fav games ever, loved the difficulty and gameplay, def getting sekiro now that i've seen this comparison.
                It really is the bastard love child of Ninja gaiden, dark souls, and tenchu
                You won’t regret it! I was a huge fan of ninja gaiden black as well. You’re gonna love sekiro.
    Argh, here's my answer to your questions:

1) Souls too hard? Yes

2) Like offensive and intense? Yes

3) Lore nut? Heck yeah

Conclusion, I may get this game at a deep discount haha.
    I personally thought most Sekiro bosses were easier than soulsborne bosses once you get semi-decent at deflecting, because I usually don't have to worry about invincibility frames or  discovering which direction to dodge into (aside from perilous attacks).... except for certain bosses like Demon of Hatred and others that inflict status effects through your guard.  I just have to deflect and a lot of bosses and minibosses basically just  self destruct.
Don't like souls games, I like this.

It's very fast and there are a bunch of mechanics beside just fighting. Stealth lets you clear an area often enough, you can escape from anything short of bosses. The extra mobility and verticality means you can flee and kill more on reset, otherwise you can go to a checkpoint and heal up. Also means death is less of an inconvenience because you can dive right back in. It's also not about chipping away health in the least, it's about breaking an enemy posture using deflections and small hits and then getting an execution.

However it's balls hard, apparently as hard if not harder than Souls. It's built around deflections that you cannot be bad at. And this isn't "parry gives instakill" this is "six irregularly timed parries and if you fuck up it's half your health each, if you succeed you may get one hit in". You don't get to sit outside range and wait for parries, you need to get stuck in hitting attacks and recover when you get parried, it's very much about fast swap of momentum. Your own posture drains whenever you get hit or block get deflected and they will annhilate you if it breaks.

But when you get deflections down it gets much easier, and then some later skills trivialise a few mechanics and enemies.
Did you dislike the Souls games because they are difficult? If so, no. You will not.

Did you dislike the Souls games because of the setting? If so, you might.

Did you dislike the Souls games because of the gameplay? If so, no. You probably won't.

Did you dislike the souls games because of the ambiguity of the everything from the story, to the lore? If so, you might.

It's a phenomenal game. But as much as Soulsborne players want to call it "not-a-souls-like-game," it's very much a Souls-like game for the average gamer.
Probably not, it's hard, fast and unforgiving
Idk why people bring souls to compare. They are nothing alike. This game is completely different and I will say that it is much more enjoyable than souls games. 

This game somehow makes you feel like a legend, it's tough and punishing but turns out to be an easy game once you master the block button. You become a god. It is always satisfying to kill enemies with deathblows. 

Initially the game is brutally difficult. But you get better at the game, not your character. It gets easier and easier, of course it is still hard as shit. You die a lot. Bosses are awesome, some are bullshit and most of them are actually so awesome to fight.

Tools and skills are fun, you can come up with some cool looking attacks.

If you are unsure just wait for a special, then get it or borrow it or try it on a friend's account. Game is great.
    Agree, it is not similar to Dark Souls combat wise. The items,  menus, and interactions with NPCs are similar, but that is it. The movement and combat are very different, with great focus on verticality. I started playing the game with a Dark Souls mentality, and that worked against me. It is hard, but well balanced, and it is a bit more forgiving on death.
    Yeah I agree with this.  After my first play through and knowing how to fight bosses i was obsessed with going back to fight them.  Madam butterfly kicked my ass the first time, but I beat her first try on the replay.  The general at the top of the tower took me 45-1hr of trying and failing first play through and I kicked his ass second try on the next one.  It was like a dance striking him to bait him to strike me so I could deflect and going back and forth with him over and over.  It was intoxicating and addictive.  I never replay games, and I've already completed it 3 times lol.  I wish there was a mode where I could just fight the bosses over and over.  It's honestly the most compelling and enjoyable gameplay in any game i've experienced.
I personally never enjoyed the souls games because I always felt there was a bit of SURPRISE! You're dead. Well fine, I guess I won't die to the surprise because I know it's there now. (that may be inaccurate but that was my feel)

This game, with how mobile you can be, even if you walk into a trap as long as you keep your wits you can get out. That and they have what felt like a plethora of save points to capture progress. I also loved the combat system.
Depends. What didn't you enjoy about the Souls games?
I’ve only new gamed dark souls 3 and the rest I couldn’t finish because of weak motivation. I can say for certain Sekiro has rightfully hooked me in with 25 hours in 3 days. I sucked at it then got good enough to beat a boss I was stuck on to only find a new boss to repeat the cycle. It’s really rewarding to beat a boss though so I recommend Sekiro if you like gratification.
I am a big fan of action games and absolutely loved ninja gaiden on the Xbox, but never really got into the souls games because of the slow deliberate nature of combat and the stamina system. I really like sekiro because it turns up the pace of combat and gives you alot more mobility. If that's the kind of games you like, you'd like sekiro
This game is harder than souls, but you are way way less lost and you don't have to worry about building your character wrong.
I didn’t like any of the souls game but this is great.
I haven't been able to make much progress is the souls games, but this game I've been able to pick up and love. I think it's the most accessible souls game.
I would recommend dark souls 3 first. This game is easily the hardest and most unforgiving to me. At least with the souls game you can invite a friend to help and sometimes bring an NPC ally in for support. Plus if you still struggle you could grind souls to level up. This just isn’t an option in Sekiro.
No he didnt. This is a repost from yesterday...
    Wow it must be such a challenge to live in this world for you.
they actually have 2 arms, they're just hiding the other for sneak attacks
    Really? That explains a few things lol
        They use it for throwing kunai at you if you're far enough
Yea part way through the combat just clicks and you suddenly feel like a master samurai. It's very satisfying just not at first. First time I fought one of these purple bros it felt impossible. Now I take em down in seconds without a scratch.
Hitting L3 in time seems difficult... It's not a quick button to push.  Glad to know it's possible at least.
Right? When I first started, I had all the dark souls muscle memory ingrained and couldn't fight anyone. An epiphany during the Genichiro fight turned me into a monster. NG+ is now cake.
All From games are hard early and get easier, and then get harder again.

Learning while weak, proficiency with advancement, mastery while strong

That's the curve most From games take. When you only have 500 HP in Bloodborne or Dark Souls and the enemies hit for like 200 while you have negligible defenses, it feels super punishing. Especially when you haven't learned the basic attack patterns or tricks you can employ to make yourself super OP early on. But then you gain some levels, gain some HP and defense, and you know the patterns? Eh, everything feels fair and even easy.
It is good!
This is the comment I was looking for. Im trying to understand why everyone is blown away by Sekiro when it looks pretty janky compared to the combat of Ninja Gaiden Black or even NG 2, both made over 10 years ago lol. 

It makes me want to fire up NG2 and record a few battles and upload them. Like damn, NG combat looks way more sick than this!
You hold your sword in front of it
    Thanks
There are much more insane things you can parry. Like the flaming horns of an elephant sized bull, or every piece of shot fired from a shotgun cannon at point blank range.
    Wait... You can parry that boss?!
        You can parry anything that isn’t a perilous attack.
            You can still parry stabs.
                You just have to shout MIKIRI COUNTER at the top of your lungs.
This guys is definitely not a game journalist
Same.  I was really interested in it until I found out it was supposed to have a punishing level of difficulty like Dark Souls.  Now I'll just wait a year or two and pick up a Game of the Year edition for like $20.
    If you ever get into Sekiro, the game is a prime example of "you need to learn what the game is trying to teach you".

Right now the biggest advice for beginners is:

* Understand how the Posturing system works and how to take advantage of it.

* Understand that attacks (both yours and your enemy's) have wind-ups, follow through's, and stun states; do not plant down in front of an enemy hoping to engage in a stationary DPS battle.

* Do not engage in combat against large groups, you WILL fail. Use your mobility (wall climbing/grappling hook) to get away and kite apart enemies to single them out.

-----

Let's use Resident Evil 2: Remake as another example:  
Many people say that the appearance of Mr. X in the mid-game makes the game too hard because it means that you have to navigate the Police Station with him chasing you.

The purpose of all the back tracking in the beginning is to teach you the floor plan of the Police Station and how to navigate the spaces, the addition of Mr X in the mid-game is the game saying "okay, now do it fast".
The feeling of overcoming something you've tried for so long to get it indescribable.
yOu WeRe StIlL jUsT a PuPpY
shes really easy if you just \*says things but all's you hear is static\*
Spam Dodge counter. It's such an easy exploit that stun locks her =/.
Corrupted Monk and Lady Butterfly?

You're pretty far in.
    Far in? Butterfly was the second boss I killed. Well she is optional she could be the first boss if you choose to do her that way.
What
    Butterfly and Corrupted Monk, presumably.
corrupted monk i could bet my life on that i wouldnt get hit, and i cheese most bosses. just run in circles and attack during his animation resets.  BUT ATTACK ONLY ONCE.
Probably because initially this game will beat the shit out of you, and for the next 10+ hours you just play rather conservatively i.e. spamming dodge, attacking recklessly, running away, stealthing most levels, etc.

When you figure things out the combat is pretty amazing to play. Parrying multi-hit combos consistently, using and switching tools effectively, knowing the perfect timing for your special moves etc. They made parrying and deathblows feel impactful that its always satisfying when you do it, even more when its deliberate and not by accident.
Game starts a bit slow, but once you unlock new abilities and prosthetics and also improve your parrying and evading skills, it becomes exponentially enjoyable.
If you can’t get past the first area of bloodborne, you will stand no chance here, to be blunt.
    [deleted]
        No, but if you quit before beating Gascoine you’ll probably quit before beating Genichiro too.
    I struggled more with the first area of bloodborne (and stopped playing the game shortly afterwards) than with the entirety of Sekiro. They’re two very different games, and Sekiro is honestly way more intuitive.
    I guess I need to watch other people play the game on Youtube or something to get the mechanics a little better. I've played 3rd person hack and slash games like this before and had no problem (GOW3, for instance). Is there a trick besides rolling around indefinitely until an open window to slash emerges? I guess I don't understand the intricacies of battle yet (if there are any?). Roll, hit, roll, hit gets boring to me so fast that I let my defenses down for a second and I die. Kind of weird to have no checkpoints or save locations until you beat all of the level and the level boss...
        [deleted]
        From Software games are not like God of War 3 at all. Their combat is far more tactical, requiring knowledge of enemy movesets and a feel for their timing.

Sekiro requires you to know enemy moves and their counters, and has 4 different basic defensive mechanics that you have to choose from at any given moment. Those are blocks, deflects, dodges, and jumps. Each defensive option has a counter, so none serve as a crutch. In order to survive you have to learn how to use them and be skilled enough to execute what you've learned.

The least-fun part of these games in my opinion is the learning part. You have to learn how to beat the game through trial and error. This is why dying is common. Different enemies and bosses require different strategies to beat and some of them are not obvious.

**I highly recommend watching YouTube videos on how to beat bosses you get stuck on.** I try to only look at those resources if I am out of ideas on how to evade a specific attack; learning the game is ultimately very rewarding so I recommend trying your damnedest to limit outside resources.
>Not really interested in spending 60 bucks to just die constantly and not progress whatsoever.

Then you'll find no enjoyment here.
I've platinumed both games, and I can tell you it's *much* harder, faster and punishing than Bloodborne. Especially frustrating is the fact that on Ps4 performance makes a big difference. Frames can dip during boss fights, and while its not single digits its enough to change the tight timing and get you hit. When most bosses 1 or 2 shot you, that's pretty infuriating. I tried it on PC afterward and the consistency of combat was wildly improved and much less frustrating.

Dont get me wrong, I like the game. But it's definitely much worse (relative to your question) than Bloodborne.
I found Sekiro substantially more difficult than any of the Souls games or Bloodborne. While Sekiro is fundamentally different from Souls/Bloodborne, I do feel that it is harder, and thus I would beat Bloodborne before looking at Sekiro. If you're struggling with Bloodborne and getting frustrated, Sekiro would be... miserable.

All the aforementioned games are similar in that they won't let you progress until you get good enough to do so. Throwing yourself at a fight over and over again won't guarantee you a win eventually; you need to be actively considering why you died and making adjustments to try and account for it.
    Okay so besides roll, hit, roll, hit, what are the tactics?
        You don't have a stamina meter and all blocks block all physical damage, you can block through just about everything. Instead of stamina you (and enemies) have posture which increases as you block and get hit. This posture regerates slower as you (and enemies) lose hp. This makes the combat much more dynamic and forces "realistic" sword fights where you are trading blows, blocking, deflecting, and staying in each other's faces. Dodge roll is much worse than it was in DS/bb. Still great but not your number 1 defense. The trick to this game like the others is having the patience to learn. If you refuse to take the time to learn to stomp every enemy you see, two random dudes will still kill you. It takes me 20+ tries on a boss to beat them, but each death is "progress" as you learn even if you don't progress the story.
I can say that I have 2 friends that have the same experience with the souls games as you. They couldn't really figure out Bloodborne or any of the dark souls series. Both of them are close to finishing Sekiro and they have loved every part of it.

This game is much more forgiving to new players. The sneaking mechanic makes world exploration much easier, the resurrection system makes it much easier and less frustrating to learn bosses, and there are "easy" ways to beat bosses as long as you pay attention to what the game is telling you.
It's a bit silly but it has to be done. If not, you'd either be vulnerable during deathblows, which wouldn't be fun since you lose control during them, or you'd be invulnerable, but the opponents would be swinging at you and clearly hitting you, yet not dealing any damage.

The way the opponents sorta take a step back during the dealthblow animations is ultimately a good design choice, and it's less immersion-breaking/frustrating than the alternatives. Plus canonically you can justify it as the dude being somewhat taken aback that his bro was just disemboweled before his eyes.
In this game those moments are more exception rather than rule. Most if the time they will fuck you with a loaded howitzer from behind even though you're busy deflecting his friend. You are invulnerable during "death blow" animations though, since you can't react then.
You might be playing it like it was Dark Souls, or you're relying on stealth too much.

Get in there and deflect every attack that is deflectable, lay off the dodge button.
It took me until like the 3rd to last boss for it to finally click, so dont feel too discouraged. I fucking hated this game early on, particularly because the first few bosses are by far the most bullshit. But once it clicked I was addicted and kept going through to platinum it ---- and I'm fucking terrible. This game is *all* about posture and deflection. Most bosses I kill are at like 80% health but get posture broken for the deathblow. To keep it somewhat concise:

*  Try to time your deflects perfectly, so you dont take posture damage. Theres multiple deflect timings, and you'll need to recognize the best ones. Blocking outright builds up the meter and will break your guard. Pay attention to the different sounds and sparking effects, they matter. 
*  Many bosses are designed to force you to learn the combat system. Whether by being vulnerable to deflects, or aggression, or something else, always try to see what they're teaching you to master. All these techniques add up to a final boss fight that uses them all.
*  Watch your posture meter closely. If it's building up too fast, hold Block so it goes down faster so you can continue to block and deflect.
*  Don't get greedy with your swings. If a boss or enemy gives you an opening, get your 1-2 hits in and back off. Also, *do not spam attacks*. The game has an input buffer so it'll keep going and locking you into swings when youre trying to dodge. Make sure your swings are deliberate.
*  Know when the enemy has blocked you and when they *deflected* your attack. Sekiro will stumble a bit more, this is your time to deflect because they're about to return a swing.
*  Lower health = much slower posture recovery. Keep yourself at >75% if possible. This applies to bosses as well. Their posture will get easier and easier to break as you whittle their health down, allowing for a deathblow. There's a guy on here who beat the final boss (a pretty long fight) in just over a minute with nothing but a handful of deflections and posture punishments. 
*  Practicing on Hanbei is underrated. It really lets you work out timings.
* Red alert kanji = either a thrust, a sweep or a grab. You'll need to see the enemy stance and move accordingly since many times 1 setup will be followed with different attacks. For stabs, *always* mikiri counter. For sweeps, jump. For grabs, pray and try to dodge at the last second so tracking doesnt kill you. Dodging sucks in this game, and jumping is barely better. So try to deflect as much as possible - including things you wouldnt expect to work.


All in all it eventually settles into a back-and-forth attacking rhythm, and while there's still plenty of frustration even for someone who gets the system it's enjoyable for sure. Again, I'm terrible at this game but if even I can Platinum it then there's hope for anyone.

Edit: Woah, gold? Thank you kind stranger. I wouldve worded this better had I known someone would spend their money on my post.
Block more. You can get away with spamming block to get occasional deflects, you'll start to get a feel for timing using that as a baseline.
    I'm all for blocking more, but I wouldn't spam it. Try and time your block with the attack, but aim on the early side rather than the late side. If you don't immediately trigger a deflection, just keep holding the block button down and block the incoming attack. Make note of when the attack actually connected, and use that to adjust your timing for next time.
The >!Genichiro!< fight is what forced me to git gud and everything started clicking (probably not too far from where you are). You have to learn to stop playing it like a Souls game and parry damn near everything. Constantly dodging will very rarely win you a fight. Also learn the posture mechanic - it's key for getting deathblows on bosses and tough enemies. I didn't know for a long time that you can hold block to regain posture faster or that posture recovers slower with low health (for both you and enemies).

Also, use stealth whenever you can. You can often run away from groups of enemies and cheese them after they de-aggro you with a stealth blow to pick them off. And you can sometimes get a free deathblow on bosses/mini bosses by sneaking up on them.

Early on, if a boss fight seems too hard, you can always try and go to a different area to get more prayer beads or other power ups that can make all of the difference.
You’re gonna find a guy in the hub area called Hanbei the undying.

He lets you practice the combat on him for free with no consequences.

USE HIM.
Hop onto steam, buy it, play for less than two hours. If you like it, keep it, otherwise refund it with no questions asked
I pick it up and put it down.  It's not bad for that.  Beating a boss is great, but it means you have a new hill to climb, so easy to just put off without bad feelings.
Believe me their kicks are worse than their swords
Incredible if you're willing to learn the combat mechanics and learn from mistakes
I play MH, but never really liked CB. Parrying in Sekiro is SOMEWHAT easy. It's literally just hit block the instant you're about to get hit. The difficulty comes from recognizing the couple attacks that cant be parried, or keeping rhythm with multiple fast attacks. If you can Guard Point, you can parry easily.
    Interesting. I guard point almost all the time in monster hunter. I might want to give this game a try...
Theyre not as difficult as him thankfully. Less moves and health and posture as you could imagine
not really, in motion it flows well, the sparks are a way of knowing wether your parry worked or not

Or you spam the Axe's charge R2 constantly and recover all HP after being hit lol
    that was the reason why bloodborne felt so easy for me compared to the other games. if charged enough other attacks can't interrupt you and any damage you receive gets healed instantly. also it staggers or knocks most enemies. the game basically became an R2 simulator for me.
        Well, the Axe is the easiest weapon, Ludwig is a close second. The game is completely different played with a whip, a katana or a boom hammer.
            Damn I only play with the threaded cane. Was my first weapon I used and no matter how many times I say I’m going to play with the rapier gun I always end up with the threaded cane.
                Probably because it's a starting weapon, and you go in with the intent of playing a skill build. You get a few hours in and suddenly you have a +6 or +9 cane and you're just going to switch weapons? No way in hell!

That's always been a criticism I have had of the souls games, sometimes you just have to wait too long to get the weapon you want.

Boss weapons in the first DS for example. I have to get all the way to the Giant in Anor Londo before I can even think about boss weapons? Fuck that.

It's especially bad in Bloodborne because you almost never find weapons barring a few exceptions. There are also tons of extra gates to quickly obtaining them.
                Put on my top hat.

Light my cane on fire.

Bathe in the blood of beasts.
        My first playthrough I fell into that habit and didn't realize how much I relied on just powering through hits then healing then my next playthrough I tried to use Dex and the katana and got my shit pushed in, lol.
The hit boxes are amazing, you're just failing to realize every mob who grabs have giant invisible magnets tiesd to their hands... And you're made of metal but you just don't know it.
    That seems to be in every game.  I hate grab attacks.  The Ninja Gaiden remakes were a pretty good example of why they're awful... you fight a boss, and it has, say, six attacks.  Five of them are blockable, fairly easy to dodge, and inflict a mild to moderate amount of damage when they hit, with the sixth being a grab attack which is unblockable, has minimal telegraphing, is very difficult to dodge, can hit you from practically anywhere on the screen, and takes off 80% of your health.

Although that's more extreme than most games, it's a similar issue in almost every game they appear, with the added 'bonus' of locking you into an overly long animation which, if you're lucky, you'll be forced to mash buttons to get out of it.  Dead Rising is particularly fun, since every enemy does an overly long grab attack!

It usually just feels like a mechanic thrown in to make things harder.  It's funny how an attack which is supposed to be point blank range, and often done by slow moving enemies is almost always the most dangerous attack they can do.
Pretty great what you can do when there's no consideration for online interaction. You can make the hitboxes basically as detailed as you want.
This made me laugh out loud,  I had a friend I tried to teach mortal combat too, told him he needs to block- same response, same reaction lol
    I played MK since I bought MK1 on 3 floppy disks a long time ago. I pretty much only played that and I believe i was good at it. I practiced on the PC and dominated arcades. Around mk3 time I was at a friend's house and he had a few friends I didn't know there too. Everyone was saying one of them played really well. I remembered being excited to play against him. According to him, his tactic was to overwhelm the opponent by going full aggro and attack at all times. When we faced each other I noticed he really never blocked, ever. This was new to me, took me a couple of rounds to adjust to that but after, it was super predictable. I just dodged or blocked, countered and easily won. I was so disapointed.
However, there was another dude there who I also didn't know and barely spoke. First few rounds and I got my arse handed to me on a platter. Mf was a sleeper, no one even had any idea the guy was a fucking beast. Took me a few rounds to adjust but after that we had some pretty epic fights. I still recall to this day, I really REALLY enjoyed fighting that guy. Was the first time I actually experienced the joy of playing vs a good opponent.

Few years later, I had moved on to unreal tournament. I had a pretty good PC and I practiced a lot so I was pretty decent. We hosted lan parties at my place where everyone brought their crt monitors and desktops, network cables everywhere (wifi was a lie at the time), etc. This one time someone brought along this guy who had moved in nearby recently. The guy was a bit shy but he was easily keeping up with me in scores and I'm thinking wow this guy is a great opponent, around my level. After a few rounds I pass my seat to someone else and go watch him play on his PC. My jaw hit the floor. This mf is playing on a super shit computer, shit graphics, really low fps (like 10-20?), a tiny monitor, the crappiest 2€ mouse, etc. His setup was really bad compared to mine and yet he was easily keeping up with me. Immediately thought, fuck, this guy is not as good as me, this guy is ages better than me. It was me who needed a good computer to keep up with him. Should this guy ever play on a decent machine he would own me so bad. I wasn't wrong. I helped him improve his PC to decent levels and that guy was a beast, I got better but was never as good as him.

He's one of my best friends now and he's a raw gem. I saw him play a shitton of games over the years. I played many with him. There was never a game he was bad at, didn't really matter which.  He has a natural talent to quickly figure and be genuinely good at any game he plays. It's pretty ridiculous and I admire him a ton for that. If he was born a few years later into this era of esports I'm sure he'd be super famous. 
Shooting people in a computer wasn't real enough for him at one point so he went to airsoft. He now plays with military people who do it to practice war scenarios and he is very good at it from what I'm told. 
Man, I miss playing against him now lol.

Ops, sorry for the text wall. Your comment brought up some really good memories that I felt like taking about :)
        No need to apologize, gaming is nostalgic for me too (I'm sure most gamers could agree)! I'm glad my comment was able to evoke that from you,  it was fun to read your experience.
    All I could think of was the opening to Bioshock Infinite, "He doesn't row."
        "No, no. I said he ***doesn't*** row."   
"Ah."
Did she get very far?..
    No.

No, she did not.
Well then this game is probably more her speed, I had a hard time with it until I unlearned my bloodborne ways and stopped dodging.
>most of the time I simply forget what does what.

Been playing video games since childhood. I obviously KNOW where my buttons are. However, this is me, Every. Quick. Time. Event. Ever.
No matter what, I panic and I freeze and then I just digress to more primitive gaming instincts. So odd, really quite baffling to me.
    Sounds like you could use some cognitive training. That might sound weird, but it can kind of be viewed as a stat our brain has. A game like starcraft 2 can help you grind it <3
Kinda... the game does reward being on the offense a lot more than other souls games, but I think the biggest part is switching between offensive and defensive play. Always attacking is going to get you killed real fast. Its about knowing when the right time to apply pressure is, and pushing that until the enemy recovers and pushes back, in which case you need to play defensively again.
    While that sounds really impressive and all, it really just boils down to attack until the enemy perfect deflects YOU. That's your cue to switch gears. That's it. This remains true for about all regular enemies while some bosses are a bit trickier.
        Right tell me how to beat that raging fucking bull then
            Run behind it. Like, hold the run button and and constantly get in that ass.
            Use the firecracker tool. You'll note the description says it "scares beasts." Unless it's in the middle of some animations (or possibly there is a x-many-seconds cooldown, not sure), a firecracker will cause the bull to stop and rear up, letting you rush in and deal a bit of damage.   

Also, jump toward it and to the side when it's charging if you need to dodge. Enemies in this game often seem to have [Dark Souls 2](http://cdn.themis-media.com/media/global/images/library/deriv/722/722390.jpg) magnetism on many of their attacks. As such, Dodging is frequently worthless. Or it may just have very narrow windows in which to be effective. Either way, you're definitely better off jumping against this guy.
                Your exanarion of the busted dodging is a perfect summary. And it explains why I'm so stuck on madam whatsherface and the bull. 2 where you evidently need to be good at dodging lol
                    No, it’s no about being good at dodging. Stop dodging. Learn to deflect. Deflect is your dodge button now. Dodge is your get killed button. You’re better off holding down that dodge button and sprinting away from an enemy 99% of the time rather than dodging.
                    If you would like some help with that, I can give you some tips. If not, stop here. 

If Lady Butterfly is giving you trouble, start by learning to disengage. Just straight up run away. (Unless she's doing her big flying perilous attack, in which case run toward her.) Just keep an eye on her to block her ranged attacks just in case and run full tilt towards whichever is the far end of the room. Once you learn how far her attack combos go, you can run *just* outside of range and then turn and get in a couple punishing hits. 

Shuriken is fairly good at knocking her out of flying attacks, but I preferred to save my Spirit Emblems for the second phase. If you can't seem to get her dead, try coming back once you have the Umbrella tool and the Projected Force skill. Don't bother with snap seeds. You *want* her to have all her summons up, then just run around until she dismisses them into homing projectiles. Position yourself by a pillar to block a handful of them so as not to break your posture, but tank the brunt of them with the Umbrella up. Get close to her, and the Projected Force attack will knock like 1/5 of her HP off.
                        Thanks for the tips! I'll try to worm on these as we as using the firecracker tool better
            Dont chase its butt.  Chasing butt is for hacks.

Wait for the bull to charge, and perfect parry when it runs straight at you head first.  You literally knock it on its ass and open it up to getting sliced and diced.
                Everyone who comments any other strategy than this one is wrong, and is doing it wrong, and is wasting theirs and your time. Parry that knockup head attack, get in 2-3 slices, back up and do it again. Throw in some firecrackers for extra hits. After about 5 parries, you'll fill his posture bar at only about half his vitality.
                WHAT?! The parry knocks it down?? I must have never had a successful parry on it then...
                    It only knocks it down on certain attacks.  The key to the bull is to get some space and parry the attack when he runs at you, dips his head, and then tries to gore you.  It's easy as hell to parry and knocks him down.

The "stay behind the bull" people are giving you bad advice.  It's possible to do it that way, but it's way harder and it's teaching you bad habits for the rest of the game.  Parry >>>> dodging when possible for every single fight in the game except for one optional boss at the very end.
            Well, apart from gimmick bosses like that I'm referring to anything with a sword (or spear). But as for the raging bull in particular, try pretending you're a bullfighter :)
    Dark souls is basically a very slow dance of doge attack, dodge dodge dodge attack. This game has a different rythm to it, a lot of the time its block block attack attack attack, block (for a while) then back into attack. There's a dancing of being in defence to a very sudden attack pattern and like you said, they push back eventually so you need to go back to defence, It took me a while to get the rhythm down but I eventually died. I'm pretty sure I ready somewhere that the bosses in the game work on a certain metronome rhythm, if you play that tick-tock sound you know when there's another attack coming.
    Rushing is a form of hesitation, and hesitation is defeat, right?
Finally, I have the answer I’ve been searching for!
[deleted]
You and me both, buddy.
I don't know, this game is pretty damn linear if you just read the dialogue. If you straight up follow the story to the first ending its like 15 hours long.
    33 minute speedrun would like a word

But yeah, to play the game as intended you're right haha
        That record (which is now sub 27) uses a number of exploits, along with taking the shortest ending. Most people are going to run into the Immortal Severance ending with is considerably longer. Just doing that ending with no exploits is over an hour speed running IIRC.
    I'm at the monkeys with 32hours on it ... :'(
        I was also at the monkeys at roughly 30 hours in. I took my time exploring every little crevice though.
            I just beat monkeys 10 minutes ago at 28 hours. Kinda funny we all took roughly the same amount of time to get there even though I'm sure we all have different amounts of different areas explored. Neat that the game branches out and pretty much lets you do whatever until you're happy to continue the plot.

/u/Lorithias: Kill the brown monkey before finishing the headless chap. He's considerably weaker and then you can focus 1v1 again.
Just gotta explore. Having a hard time somewhere? Look somewhere else. After awhile go back and give it another try. Sekiro is fairly linear but if you’re really stumped there’s no harm in checking a guide.
Your goal is to exhaust all options until you can proceed. My problem is that it is one uphill battle after another.
I find this one's a lot nicer to you than Dark Souls where you're just told you have to link the fire and a general instruction on how to do it or Bloodborne where the only guidance you have is "end the nightmare".

in Sekiro, someone's telling you what you have to do and it's pretty linear.  The first part is "save the heir" and you know he's in the castle and that's the only way to go.
This is a common complaint and I totally understand.  Moving from point A to point B without knowing where the fuck point B even is or how to get there infuriates a lot of people, but that process of trial and error is precisely what some people like me love so much.  To each his own.  I obsess over these games and wish all my friends loved them as much as me, but I totally get it
Sekiro is way more linear and less confusing to navigate through than Dark Souls.
This game has frustrated me so much because of not being sure where I'm supposed to be going. Two specific times in the game (one early on, the other right near the end) I reach a boss that gives me extreme, unbelievable trouble (first Lady Butterfly, and later the Demon of Hatred) where I run into a wall dying over and over and over, only to give up and look them up on the wiki and find out that they're an optional fight and I could have just gone down a different path I didn't even know was there. This is a perfect example of why the game's difficulty (and it reputation for such) is a detriment to the gaming experience- in another game you'll reach a brick wall boss and think "Oh, I'm supposed to come back later", but in this game, there's no way of knowing if I'm supposed to come back later or if I'm just supposed to git gud and power through it.
    This is an odd thing. If you can't do something, you go and explore. That's video games 101. Has been forever.
    Based on what your saying, if you treated it like a normal game then you would be fine. Can’t beat this boss? Go explore. It makes the game way easier as you get more skills and more health. I went to Lady Butterfly and immediately left to go explore more of the game and came back with twice the amount of health and posture, making the fight way easier. I’m pretty sure there was another point where I had an option of three different main bosses because I had decided to go kill all the mini bosses in their areas first, making all the main bosses easier.
    Then Lobosjr beats it no damage, level 1, naked. 3 days after the game comes out.
    There’s always other paths to explore though. When I struggle with a boss, I go explore another area that I haven’t explored yet.

Eventually I might hit multiple walls, but by that point I end up beating one of the bosses I struggled with preciously. 

That being said though, this game definitely lacked direction more than other FS games imo. I discovered The Monks and ashina depths before even beating Genichiro for example lol.
        I think discovering Monks and Depths is totally legit before fighting Genichiro. Recommended in one sense with how much it helps you upgrade skills and collect prayer beads. That’s the way I went!

In general, I think Sekiro encourages the player to explore and beat mini bosses for beads before taking on main bosses.
    If you run into a wall, no reason to keep hitting. Up until the very end of the game, there's _always_ two or three various paths you can go down at any time. It's an incredibly open game and can be tackled in a ton of various orders. There's very few spots where it's "You're meant to go this way, and then this way." Every route as harder and easier spots, and you're meant to go down which ever way you choose, or even go down one area a bit, back and then another for a bit, and then back, whatever. 

Try not to think of it like "what's the way I'm supposed to go right now" and just go wherever you're feeling like.
    I really couldn’t disagree more. Both of those instances are clearly optional if you’re paying attention to what the npcs are telling you. Even if you find the bell from the lady first, the sculptor tells you where you goal actually is. The entire way to DoH is optional because, again, they tell you exactly where your destination is and how to get there. This tells me you didn’t listen to the characters and just spammed past their dialogue.
    It's pretty much a hallmark of this studio that their games don't explain much of anything and then punish you for not knowing what was never explained.
        Definitely; but since every interview and review insisted that this game was NOT a soulsborne, I had no way of knowing whether this game would be the same in that regard.
Shurikens, snap seeds
    Also just getting a small amount of damage on her really impacts her posture recovery speed. From there you can pretty much just parry everything and she dies. No need to worry too much about anything besides staying alive once you've hit her 3 or 4 times.   
Still not nearly as easy as just shooting a bunch of shurikens up her ass when shes jumps onto a wire, but much more satisfying when you get the kill.
you can cheese her pretty hard on the first part. If you have the art that closes distance (i forget what it's called, but it's a jumping flip forward).

two attacks, then the jump and she'll be caught in an endless loop.

In the second phase, whenever she does her illusion thing, just run in a circle around the arena until they're gone, but other than that, this one's harder to cheese.
instead of sidestepping, you can keep sprinting around her and get a chance to attack. She cant deflect if you are on her backside. when she is in the air you can use the shuriken to knock her down and charge an attack on her. good luck
Whos the first boss? Do you mean lady butterfly, gyoubu, or the ogre?
    [deleted]
        The actual bosses do get you to be better at the game, though. Lady Butterfly tip: ignore her illusions and just run around the edge of the arena until she dispels it. Also, Shuriken is godly in that fight.
            It's also far easier to so with another gourd seed and an attack up from the first full boss.  Trying to finish her off first is difficult.  I beat her the second try after coming back then.
            I found out last night when I finally managed to beat her that you can stop her from ever summoning the illusions if you keep pressure on her all through the second phase. She always appears by the big statue after the first deathblow so you can just run over and wait for her to appear and start attacking her before she even has a chance to do anything.
                I tried doing that, but she would always jump and summon before I could close the gap. Did you corner lock her or something?
                    Now that I think about it I did push her back towards the statue each time so she didn't have far to run for that initial attack. I just stayed glued to her the entire time and she generally acted like she did in the first phase, but with the butterflies added in. The only time she managed to get off the summon after I started being so aggressive was when I'd jump away to heal.

Granted, I the only reason I was able to get so aggressive was because I practically memorized her patterns after days of dying over and over haha
                        Sounds like my experience with Genichiro. If that battle taught me anything, it was “don’t panic” and “for the love of god, the ogre should have taught you this, DON’T GET GREEDY!”
            You can also run around and occasionally hit the illusions at opportune times, which one shots them and replenishes shuriken charges
        You're there a bit too early if this is your first boss.

Should've fought the horseman first.
            MY NAME IS GYUBO ONIWA
                MY NAME IS GYUBO ONIWA *slashes the horse 5 times*
                    BRAT!
            Oh is Gyubo considered the "first" boss? If that's the case, maybe there's hope for me yet! That's the fight where it first started feeling like I was getting a hang of the game.

I mean, he still kicked my ass a bunch of times, but once I got a good rhythm of deflecting his charges and grappling over the long sweep attack, it actually felt doable. Only had to use the firecrackers twice when I finally beat him!

^^And ^^then ^^the ^^bull ^^made ^^me ^^his ^^plaything...
                This is kinda what happened to me in dark souls 1. I went to the graveyard with the skeletons right after the tutorial, and kept fighting them until i could kinda kill a couple. Then i was like "fuck me this game isnt just hard its bullshit" then i found the eay to the aquaduct and started killing the undead there like 'oh... thiiiis is the first area'
                    This was me in Dark Souls 2, lol
                        Not trying to be rude, but how? DaS2 starting area leads to 3 different areas, 1 which I'm sure won't find first time as it requires you to have a ton of Health or the ring that nullifies fall damage. So you really only have 2 paths the first time and neither of them leads to a high level area. One leads to the giant boss and the other to the big guy with armor (forgot it's name) and neither of them are hard or at least not late into the game hard. The guy with armor in particular, you can bait him and he'll kill himself by falling off the platform lol.
                            Probably Dragonrider area I’m guessing. I didn’t find it very hard either but the forest of giants is much easier to fight some easy enemies and level up a bit. The giant soldiers can be really aggravating if you’re new to the series.
                The real bosses drop memories. Mini bosses drop prayer beads.
                    Except for the anomaly of Headless Ape which gives 2 prayer beads and a memory.
                    ah, that's an easy distinction to remember. thanks!
                I'm with you on all this. That bull fight was stupid.
                    Bull fight was a game changer. I had to rework my entire playstyle around the douche. I ended up using all my gourds, pellets, and rez to get that bastard down on the 5th go. The wiki really helped me out on the fight as well.
                        I'm back to getting my shit pushed in by Lady Butterfly and Ashina Elite.
                            You can cheese the Elite with the spear if you want.   He can't really deal with it.   Fighting fair is for samurai, not shinobi.
                            Easy strat for the elite: just deflect.

He has this double attack that you can bait if you stay on range. Just spam block once he starts charging it and then back away. 3-4 times and you can finish him. Do that twice and he's dead.

There are multiple bosses in the game in which spamming block and doing nothing else makes the whole fight completely trivial
                How did you get the firecracker before fighting him???
                    Apparently firecrackers can be bought from the Mob merchant before the ogre, but I never found that the first time through.
                    There's a memorial mob that sells it at the top of a cliff kind of near the old woman that gives you the bell. You have to grapple up to the top.
        It doesn't get easier, but there totally is an "aha" moment in regards to blocking/parrying being insanely powerful.
        My first 15-20 hours of playing, I just got wrecked over and over again, but then it finally 'clicked' for me and the game got a ton more fun.

There were definitely moments where I wasn't sure if I'd ever get good enough to really enjoy the game, but, I did, eventually.
        Lady Butterfly isn't the first boss. Shes an optional side quest boss that's fairly difficult. Come back to her later in the game.
        Butterfly is an optional boss, you actually don't even need to kill her.
        Dodge attack is your best friend, stick with it. We believe in you.
            Specifically for Lady Butterfly that works well. Pretty much every boss has a "simple" way to beat them

&#x200B;

>!Ogre - All of his attacks (except his one "fast" grab) are really really slow, at least by Sekiro enemy standards. He's also really difficult because you lack healing gourds and most people think you \*need\* to get two finisher blows on him unlike most other minibosses where you can get a sneak attack off. You can actually use Gacchin sugar to sneak up on the ogre - or aggro him and then lose aggro and get him much easier after he's broken free.!<

>!Gyoubu - Blocking works really well against him - you don't need to worry much about your posture because he gives you long breaks to recover posture - and a lot of free hits with the grapple-attack (if you have it). Firecrackers help, but definitely not necessary.!<

>!Blazin Bull - Even difficult on new game+, but if you deflect his charge like a matador you can wear his posture down before he kills you. Use dousing powder to keep from burning, and heal up when you get the chance. Also I've watched a lot of people struggle against him on streams/youtube but they don't seem to realize you can stay locked on to him and sprint around, which makes dodging him really really easy.!<

>!Guardian Ape - Pretty tough, since you really need deal a lot of vitality damage to end up beating him - but he has several attacks that leave him open for a few free hits. Also, you can still deflect him - I've seen many people not even try to block or deflect his attacks. They are erratic, but if you're disciplined in holding your block up you shouldn't get surprised too much.!<

>!Guardian Ape (headless) - The freaky factor puts a lot of people off, but his attacks are really telegraphed (easy to deflect or \*at least block\*), and if you can recognize his scream of terror then you shouldn't really even need to use pacifying agents. Also, the loaded spear (i think it's the spiral upgrade) deals massive damage to him if you can get him at the right time.!<

>!Guardian Ape (re-fight) - During the two ape portion of the fight the second ape doesn't attack super often, and it has lower vitality and breaks posture more easily - but if you keep your distance you can still probably take out the headless one and if you do then the second ape dies at the same time.!<

>!Genichiro - Attack when he isn't attacking, and deflect after he \*perfect\* deflects your strike. The timing is fairly easy to learn, and many sworded enemies have the same style where you attack until you get perfect deflected and then switch to something defensive. Deflect his jumping slash and it does a lot of posture damage. His second phase is still pretty tough, but if you can get the lighting reversal down then it's actually a really easy fight. Some of his timing and patterns are a little different, but he has the same basic attack patterns.!<

>!Long-arm centipede - Some people find him really easy but others struggle a ton on him. His flurry is really intimidating, but it only takes like two flurries to get his posture broken, and jump and stomp his head after his sweep for aton of posture damage.!<

Aaand there are others but i'm tired of typing. I'm sure there are better ways to beat them than what I've listed too, which is beautiful.
        Things click eventually, but pace yourself. Sekiro isn't one of these games you play for hours & hours each day (if you have the time in the first place). Understanding parrying & how to counter deathblows is key. 

If you're keen to try Lady Butterfly again there's a very easy tactic that doesn't even use blocking. When she attacks dodge to the right & use the dodge slash, then she'll kick again, dodge to the right & slash, on & on. Since you dodge out of the way she resets her combo & that slow kick is easy to dodge & since you're interrupting an attack from the side you're getting a proper hit in & she's not deflecting or guarding. When she jumps in the air, all you have to do is throw a shuriken & she'll fall on her face allowing you a couple hits.
        Another tip for lady butterfly if no one has said it already. You can get in 2 swings before she counter attacks so the pattern to whittle her posture down is attack attack deflect. Repeat that and pressure her enough to break her posture. If she jumps up Shuriken immediately and repeat if she gets knocked down. It’s all about breaking her posture
            Yet another tip; in phase two you don’t need snap seeds to dispel the illusions - just sprint around the perimeter until they go away!
        Shuriken her in the air, side step to her right. What combat art are you using?
Horse bro isn’t too hard once you figure out you just have to wait for the grapple indicator for free damage. Can legit just block the rest of his attacks since he runs past you with all of them anyways.
    Also if you figure out the single prosthetic that literally every animal-based boss is vulnerable too, that fight becomes a pretty big joke.
Which one was that? because a lot of people consider Genichiro the first 'Boss' in the game. Even though you fight a few before him. 

In any case, I hate to sound like a broken record with this comment, but a whole lot of people are treating Sekiro like just another souls game, when it really is a completely different beast. I rage quit Genichiro the first time I fought him too. I literally couldn't understand how people were beating him. I looked up YouTube videos. I read articles. I did everything I could possibly think of to go into that fight with an advantage...and I STILL couldn't beat him. It's cliche, but I literally had to accept the combat system before I even stood a chance. But even after I rage quit, I couldn't help but think about beating him at work the next day. lol

Eventually, the combat just clicked, and I FINALLY beat him. The entire game changed for me after that. It took on a whole new tone and challenge for me. I just fought Genichiro in NG+ yesterday and didn't even break a sweat during the fight. 

It's just like learning the intricacies of Dark Souls and then getting good at that system. It just takes time and an open mind. 

Sorry for the long rant. I just feel like a lot of people who i've talked to about the game have the same mentality towards it.
    Genichiro is the line that divides people who know how to play the game and people who don't.

Later bosses are technically more impressive and difficult, but Genichiro is downright perfect. No tricks, no gimmicks, no cheesing. You just need to be good enough.
        I did lady butterfly first, and she was way harder for me.
    Which is funny... As I thought Genichiro was ridiculously easy for a big fight, and struggled forever on Butterfly.  Each boss has a different rhythm that different people Excel at.  For me Genichiro is exact the type I like, patterned predictable low reaction speed boss.  He hits hard, but easy to wear down (for me, of course).

I also had killed just about every side boss and Lady butterfly before getting to him though...  So I likely had already struggled enough to get good at sword fights.  Spears...  Me and the mekiro counter don't get along.  High reaction speed fights like seven Spears or ashina elite I cheesed through with Spears and axes...
    Same kinds thing happened for me in dark souls, I remember I had spent probably 45 minutes fighting the nameless king on my first playthrough which was just a grind of me throwing myself at him, something clicked and then when I started a new playthrough on ng+ I beat him on the first try. it's so satisfying to see visible improvement in these types of games.
Unsold!
    Lmao
    There are some user made mods, on PC at least, that let you show it down to your level.
        I have old man reflexes, and I get hard stuck on every boss and miniboss. Thanks for the tip. Maybe the 60$ wasn't wasted.
            Yeah I needed to take a break from this game because my old man reflexes just aren't working with this game. i've beaten 2 bosses... out of 13... just the thought of bosses being significantly more difficult than what I've already faced makes me wish I didn't buy the game. But the game is beautifully done... it's just not for us old guys
How is time slowed then? Is it just slow mo applied to the video, or a cheat?
    Its slowed in post. The game doesn't have 16:9 blackbars either. Whoever made this was trying to make it look cinematic
        They were trying to crop out the UI and figured this was the best way to do it, yeah.
            You can actually turn off the hud in the display settings.
        Judging by how smooth the movement looks when slowed down, I'm going to guess that the game was played and recorded with slowmo cheat, and then sped up in post. Unless it was being run with unlocked frame rate, and hitting a couple hundred FPS
            Pretty sure that the game is capped at 60 even on pc.
                i think there is mod that unlocks framerate
    There is actually a program out right now that allows you to slow the game and speed up the player. It's as close to an easy mode as you can get for this game.
    Theres a mod which you can use to slow down the animations of the enemies
        You can open the logo in ms paint and write "you win" under it, too
            Idk the name but if you search for the "i beat sekiro with cheats and i feel fine" article mentioned it, u can find it there
Yep
Firecrackers make ogre obsolete.
    I just burned the mothafucka
It's all good I used the unbeatable strategy on it, worked like a charm
Yeah the combat in the Soul's games were a bit annoying and repetitive so I didn't like it much. If its fast and upbeat fighting then I think I will like this game. Thanks!
    Ok so, the skill ceiling in this game is quite high. But it *can* feel *very* repetitive early on, when it feels like you're just mashing attack over and over. But in general, the combat is very snappy and quick. A step beyond BB, and way behind Souls, in that regard.
    Not the person you’re speaking too, but the combat is sensational. I will say I’m biased; having played and beat all previous souls games. That being said, if you were a fan of something like ninja gaiden or other oldschool hacknslash action titles and love a brutal challenge, this game is for you!
        ninja gaiden black is one of my fav games ever, loved the difficulty and gameplay, def getting sekiro now that i've seen this comparison.
            It really is the bastard love child of Ninja gaiden, dark souls, and tenchu
            You won’t regret it! I was a huge fan of ninja gaiden black as well. You’re gonna love sekiro.
Argh, here's my answer to your questions:

1) Souls too hard? Yes

2) Like offensive and intense? Yes

3) Lore nut? Heck yeah

Conclusion, I may get this game at a deep discount haha.
I personally thought most Sekiro bosses were easier than soulsborne bosses once you get semi-decent at deflecting, because I usually don't have to worry about invincibility frames or  discovering which direction to dodge into (aside from perilous attacks).... except for certain bosses like Demon of Hatred and others that inflict status effects through your guard.  I just have to deflect and a lot of bosses and minibosses basically just  self destruct.
Agree, it is not similar to Dark Souls combat wise. The items,  menus, and interactions with NPCs are similar, but that is it. The movement and combat are very different, with great focus on verticality. I started playing the game with a Dark Souls mentality, and that worked against me. It is hard, but well balanced, and it is a bit more forgiving on death.
Yeah I agree with this.  After my first play through and knowing how to fight bosses i was obsessed with going back to fight them.  Madam butterfly kicked my ass the first time, but I beat her first try on the replay.  The general at the top of the tower took me 45-1hr of trying and failing first play through and I kicked his ass second try on the next one.  It was like a dance striking him to bait him to strike me so I could deflect and going back and forth with him over and over.  It was intoxicating and addictive.  I never replay games, and I've already completed it 3 times lol.  I wish there was a mode where I could just fight the bosses over and over.  It's honestly the most compelling and enjoyable gameplay in any game i've experienced.
Wow it must be such a challenge to live in this world for you.
Really? That explains a few things lol
    They use it for throwing kunai at you if you're far enough
Thanks
Wait... You can parry that boss?!
    You can parry anything that isn’t a perilous attack.
        You can still parry stabs.
            You just have to shout MIKIRI COUNTER at the top of your lungs.
If you ever get into Sekiro, the game is a prime example of "you need to learn what the game is trying to teach you".

Right now the biggest advice for beginners is:

* Understand how the Posturing system works and how to take advantage of it.

* Understand that attacks (both yours and your enemy's) have wind-ups, follow through's, and stun states; do not plant down in front of an enemy hoping to engage in a stationary DPS battle.

* Do not engage in combat against large groups, you WILL fail. Use your mobility (wall climbing/grappling hook) to get away and kite apart enemies to single them out.

-----

Let's use Resident Evil 2: Remake as another example:  
Many people say that the appearance of Mr. X in the mid-game makes the game too hard because it means that you have to navigate the Police Station with him chasing you.

The purpose of all the back tracking in the beginning is to teach you the floor plan of the Police Station and how to navigate the spaces, the addition of Mr X in the mid-game is the game saying "okay, now do it fast".
Far in? Butterfly was the second boss I killed. Well she is optional she could be the first boss if you choose to do her that way.
Butterfly and Corrupted Monk, presumably.
[deleted]
    No, but if you quit before beating Gascoine you’ll probably quit before beating Genichiro too.
I struggled more with the first area of bloodborne (and stopped playing the game shortly afterwards) than with the entirety of Sekiro. They’re two very different games, and Sekiro is honestly way more intuitive.
I guess I need to watch other people play the game on Youtube or something to get the mechanics a little better. I've played 3rd person hack and slash games like this before and had no problem (GOW3, for instance). Is there a trick besides rolling around indefinitely until an open window to slash emerges? I guess I don't understand the intricacies of battle yet (if there are any?). Roll, hit, roll, hit gets boring to me so fast that I let my defenses down for a second and I die. Kind of weird to have no checkpoints or save locations until you beat all of the level and the level boss...
    [deleted]
    From Software games are not like God of War 3 at all. Their combat is far more tactical, requiring knowledge of enemy movesets and a feel for their timing.

Sekiro requires you to know enemy moves and their counters, and has 4 different basic defensive mechanics that you have to choose from at any given moment. Those are blocks, deflects, dodges, and jumps. Each defensive option has a counter, so none serve as a crutch. In order to survive you have to learn how to use them and be skilled enough to execute what you've learned.

The least-fun part of these games in my opinion is the learning part. You have to learn how to beat the game through trial and error. This is why dying is common. Different enemies and bosses require different strategies to beat and some of them are not obvious.

**I highly recommend watching YouTube videos on how to beat bosses you get stuck on.** I try to only look at those resources if I am out of ideas on how to evade a specific attack; learning the game is ultimately very rewarding so I recommend trying your damnedest to limit outside resources.
Okay so besides roll, hit, roll, hit, what are the tactics?
    You don't have a stamina meter and all blocks block all physical damage, you can block through just about everything. Instead of stamina you (and enemies) have posture which increases as you block and get hit. This posture regerates slower as you (and enemies) lose hp. This makes the combat much more dynamic and forces "realistic" sword fights where you are trading blows, blocking, deflecting, and staying in each other's faces. Dodge roll is much worse than it was in DS/bb. Still great but not your number 1 defense. The trick to this game like the others is having the patience to learn. If you refuse to take the time to learn to stomp every enemy you see, two random dudes will still kill you. It takes me 20+ tries on a boss to beat them, but each death is "progress" as you learn even if you don't progress the story.
I'm all for blocking more, but I wouldn't spam it. Try and time your block with the attack, but aim on the early side rather than the late side. If you don't immediately trigger a deflection, just keep holding the block button down and block the incoming attack. Make note of when the attack actually connected, and use that to adjust your timing for next time.
Interesting. I guard point almost all the time in monster hunter. I might want to give this game a try...
##JAN JAN BYAN BYAN KYUUKYOKU NOOOO BATOOORUUUU
    So happy I was able to hear all of this perfectly in my brain.
        Now I will have to hear it on my way home...
    #Hey hey let's go! Kenka suru
#Taisetsu na mono o. protect my balls
#Boku ga warui, so let's fighting
#Let's fighting love
#Let's fighting love
that was the reason why bloodborne felt so easy for me compared to the other games. if charged enough other attacks can't interrupt you and any damage you receive gets healed instantly. also it staggers or knocks most enemies. the game basically became an R2 simulator for me.
    Well, the Axe is the easiest weapon, Ludwig is a close second. The game is completely different played with a whip, a katana or a boom hammer.
        Damn I only play with the threaded cane. Was my first weapon I used and no matter how many times I say I’m going to play with the rapier gun I always end up with the threaded cane.
            Probably because it's a starting weapon, and you go in with the intent of playing a skill build. You get a few hours in and suddenly you have a +6 or +9 cane and you're just going to switch weapons? No way in hell!

That's always been a criticism I have had of the souls games, sometimes you just have to wait too long to get the weapon you want.

Boss weapons in the first DS for example. I have to get all the way to the Giant in Anor Londo before I can even think about boss weapons? Fuck that.

It's especially bad in Bloodborne because you almost never find weapons barring a few exceptions. There are also tons of extra gates to quickly obtaining them.
            Put on my top hat.

Light my cane on fire.

Bathe in the blood of beasts.
    My first playthrough I fell into that habit and didn't realize how much I relied on just powering through hits then healing then my next playthrough I tried to use Dex and the katana and got my shit pushed in, lol.
That seems to be in every game.  I hate grab attacks.  The Ninja Gaiden remakes were a pretty good example of why they're awful... you fight a boss, and it has, say, six attacks.  Five of them are blockable, fairly easy to dodge, and inflict a mild to moderate amount of damage when they hit, with the sixth being a grab attack which is unblockable, has minimal telegraphing, is very difficult to dodge, can hit you from practically anywhere on the screen, and takes off 80% of your health.

Although that's more extreme than most games, it's a similar issue in almost every game they appear, with the added 'bonus' of locking you into an overly long animation which, if you're lucky, you'll be forced to mash buttons to get out of it.  Dead Rising is particularly fun, since every enemy does an overly long grab attack!

It usually just feels like a mechanic thrown in to make things harder.  It's funny how an attack which is supposed to be point blank range, and often done by slow moving enemies is almost always the most dangerous attack they can do.
I played MK since I bought MK1 on 3 floppy disks a long time ago. I pretty much only played that and I believe i was good at it. I practiced on the PC and dominated arcades. Around mk3 time I was at a friend's house and he had a few friends I didn't know there too. Everyone was saying one of them played really well. I remembered being excited to play against him. According to him, his tactic was to overwhelm the opponent by going full aggro and attack at all times. When we faced each other I noticed he really never blocked, ever. This was new to me, took me a couple of rounds to adjust to that but after, it was super predictable. I just dodged or blocked, countered and easily won. I was so disapointed.
However, there was another dude there who I also didn't know and barely spoke. First few rounds and I got my arse handed to me on a platter. Mf was a sleeper, no one even had any idea the guy was a fucking beast. Took me a few rounds to adjust but after that we had some pretty epic fights. I still recall to this day, I really REALLY enjoyed fighting that guy. Was the first time I actually experienced the joy of playing vs a good opponent.

Few years later, I had moved on to unreal tournament. I had a pretty good PC and I practiced a lot so I was pretty decent. We hosted lan parties at my place where everyone brought their crt monitors and desktops, network cables everywhere (wifi was a lie at the time), etc. This one time someone brought along this guy who had moved in nearby recently. The guy was a bit shy but he was easily keeping up with me in scores and I'm thinking wow this guy is a great opponent, around my level. After a few rounds I pass my seat to someone else and go watch him play on his PC. My jaw hit the floor. This mf is playing on a super shit computer, shit graphics, really low fps (like 10-20?), a tiny monitor, the crappiest 2€ mouse, etc. His setup was really bad compared to mine and yet he was easily keeping up with me. Immediately thought, fuck, this guy is not as good as me, this guy is ages better than me. It was me who needed a good computer to keep up with him. Should this guy ever play on a decent machine he would own me so bad. I wasn't wrong. I helped him improve his PC to decent levels and that guy was a beast, I got better but was never as good as him.

He's one of my best friends now and he's a raw gem. I saw him play a shitton of games over the years. I played many with him. There was never a game he was bad at, didn't really matter which.  He has a natural talent to quickly figure and be genuinely good at any game he plays. It's pretty ridiculous and I admire him a ton for that. If he was born a few years later into this era of esports I'm sure he'd be super famous. 
Shooting people in a computer wasn't real enough for him at one point so he went to airsoft. He now plays with military people who do it to practice war scenarios and he is very good at it from what I'm told. 
Man, I miss playing against him now lol.

Ops, sorry for the text wall. Your comment brought up some really good memories that I felt like taking about :)
    No need to apologize, gaming is nostalgic for me too (I'm sure most gamers could agree)! I'm glad my comment was able to evoke that from you,  it was fun to read your experience.
All I could think of was the opening to Bioshock Infinite, "He doesn't row."
    "No, no. I said he ***doesn't*** row."   
"Ah."
No.

No, she did not.
Sounds like you could use some cognitive training. That might sound weird, but it can kind of be viewed as a stat our brain has. A game like starcraft 2 can help you grind it <3
While that sounds really impressive and all, it really just boils down to attack until the enemy perfect deflects YOU. That's your cue to switch gears. That's it. This remains true for about all regular enemies while some bosses are a bit trickier.
    Right tell me how to beat that raging fucking bull then
        Run behind it. Like, hold the run button and and constantly get in that ass.
        Use the firecracker tool. You'll note the description says it "scares beasts." Unless it's in the middle of some animations (or possibly there is a x-many-seconds cooldown, not sure), a firecracker will cause the bull to stop and rear up, letting you rush in and deal a bit of damage.   

Also, jump toward it and to the side when it's charging if you need to dodge. Enemies in this game often seem to have [Dark Souls 2](http://cdn.themis-media.com/media/global/images/library/deriv/722/722390.jpg) magnetism on many of their attacks. As such, Dodging is frequently worthless. Or it may just have very narrow windows in which to be effective. Either way, you're definitely better off jumping against this guy.
            Your exanarion of the busted dodging is a perfect summary. And it explains why I'm so stuck on madam whatsherface and the bull. 2 where you evidently need to be good at dodging lol
                No, it’s no about being good at dodging. Stop dodging. Learn to deflect. Deflect is your dodge button now. Dodge is your get killed button. You’re better off holding down that dodge button and sprinting away from an enemy 99% of the time rather than dodging.
                If you would like some help with that, I can give you some tips. If not, stop here. 

If Lady Butterfly is giving you trouble, start by learning to disengage. Just straight up run away. (Unless she's doing her big flying perilous attack, in which case run toward her.) Just keep an eye on her to block her ranged attacks just in case and run full tilt towards whichever is the far end of the room. Once you learn how far her attack combos go, you can run *just* outside of range and then turn and get in a couple punishing hits. 

Shuriken is fairly good at knocking her out of flying attacks, but I preferred to save my Spirit Emblems for the second phase. If you can't seem to get her dead, try coming back once you have the Umbrella tool and the Projected Force skill. Don't bother with snap seeds. You *want* her to have all her summons up, then just run around until she dismisses them into homing projectiles. Position yourself by a pillar to block a handful of them so as not to break your posture, but tank the brunt of them with the Umbrella up. Get close to her, and the Projected Force attack will knock like 1/5 of her HP off.
                    Thanks for the tips! I'll try to worm on these as we as using the firecracker tool better
        Dont chase its butt.  Chasing butt is for hacks.

Wait for the bull to charge, and perfect parry when it runs straight at you head first.  You literally knock it on its ass and open it up to getting sliced and diced.
            Everyone who comments any other strategy than this one is wrong, and is doing it wrong, and is wasting theirs and your time. Parry that knockup head attack, get in 2-3 slices, back up and do it again. Throw in some firecrackers for extra hits. After about 5 parries, you'll fill his posture bar at only about half his vitality.
            WHAT?! The parry knocks it down?? I must have never had a successful parry on it then...
                It only knocks it down on certain attacks.  The key to the bull is to get some space and parry the attack when he runs at you, dips his head, and then tries to gore you.  It's easy as hell to parry and knocks him down.

The "stay behind the bull" people are giving you bad advice.  It's possible to do it that way, but it's way harder and it's teaching you bad habits for the rest of the game.  Parry >>>> dodging when possible for every single fight in the game except for one optional boss at the very end.
        Well, apart from gimmick bosses like that I'm referring to anything with a sword (or spear). But as for the raging bull in particular, try pretending you're a bullfighter :)
Dark souls is basically a very slow dance of doge attack, dodge dodge dodge attack. This game has a different rythm to it, a lot of the time its block block attack attack attack, block (for a while) then back into attack. There's a dancing of being in defence to a very sudden attack pattern and like you said, they push back eventually so you need to go back to defence, It took me a while to get the rhythm down but I eventually died. I'm pretty sure I ready somewhere that the bosses in the game work on a certain metronome rhythm, if you play that tick-tock sound you know when there's another attack coming.
Rushing is a form of hesitation, and hesitation is defeat, right?
33 minute speedrun would like a word

But yeah, to play the game as intended you're right haha
    That record (which is now sub 27) uses a number of exploits, along with taking the shortest ending. Most people are going to run into the Immortal Severance ending with is considerably longer. Just doing that ending with no exploits is over an hour speed running IIRC.
I'm at the monkeys with 32hours on it ... :'(
    I was also at the monkeys at roughly 30 hours in. I took my time exploring every little crevice though.
        I just beat monkeys 10 minutes ago at 28 hours. Kinda funny we all took roughly the same amount of time to get there even though I'm sure we all have different amounts of different areas explored. Neat that the game branches out and pretty much lets you do whatever until you're happy to continue the plot.

/u/Lorithias: Kill the brown monkey before finishing the headless chap. He's considerably weaker and then you can focus 1v1 again.
This is an odd thing. If you can't do something, you go and explore. That's video games 101. Has been forever.
Based on what your saying, if you treated it like a normal game then you would be fine. Can’t beat this boss? Go explore. It makes the game way easier as you get more skills and more health. I went to Lady Butterfly and immediately left to go explore more of the game and came back with twice the amount of health and posture, making the fight way easier. I’m pretty sure there was another point where I had an option of three different main bosses because I had decided to go kill all the mini bosses in their areas first, making all the main bosses easier.
Then Lobosjr beats it no damage, level 1, naked. 3 days after the game comes out.
There’s always other paths to explore though. When I struggle with a boss, I go explore another area that I haven’t explored yet.

Eventually I might hit multiple walls, but by that point I end up beating one of the bosses I struggled with preciously. 

That being said though, this game definitely lacked direction more than other FS games imo. I discovered The Monks and ashina depths before even beating Genichiro for example lol.
    I think discovering Monks and Depths is totally legit before fighting Genichiro. Recommended in one sense with how much it helps you upgrade skills and collect prayer beads. That’s the way I went!

In general, I think Sekiro encourages the player to explore and beat mini bosses for beads before taking on main bosses.
If you run into a wall, no reason to keep hitting. Up until the very end of the game, there's _always_ two or three various paths you can go down at any time. It's an incredibly open game and can be tackled in a ton of various orders. There's very few spots where it's "You're meant to go this way, and then this way." Every route as harder and easier spots, and you're meant to go down which ever way you choose, or even go down one area a bit, back and then another for a bit, and then back, whatever. 

Try not to think of it like "what's the way I'm supposed to go right now" and just go wherever you're feeling like.
I really couldn’t disagree more. Both of those instances are clearly optional if you’re paying attention to what the npcs are telling you. Even if you find the bell from the lady first, the sculptor tells you where you goal actually is. The entire way to DoH is optional because, again, they tell you exactly where your destination is and how to get there. This tells me you didn’t listen to the characters and just spammed past their dialogue.
It's pretty much a hallmark of this studio that their games don't explain much of anything and then punish you for not knowing what was never explained.
    Definitely; but since every interview and review insisted that this game was NOT a soulsborne, I had no way of knowing whether this game would be the same in that regard.
Also just getting a small amount of damage on her really impacts her posture recovery speed. From there you can pretty much just parry everything and she dies. No need to worry too much about anything besides staying alive once you've hit her 3 or 4 times.   
Still not nearly as easy as just shooting a bunch of shurikens up her ass when shes jumps onto a wire, but much more satisfying when you get the kill.

    The actual bosses do get you to be better at the game, though. Lady Butterfly tip: ignore her illusions and just run around the edge of the arena until she dispels it. Also, Shuriken is godly in that fight.
        It's also far easier to so with another gourd seed and an attack up from the first full boss.  Trying to finish her off first is difficult.  I beat her the second try after coming back then.
        I found out last night when I finally managed to beat her that you can stop her from ever summoning the illusions if you keep pressure on her all through the second phase. She always appears by the big statue after the first deathblow so you can just run over and wait for her to appear and start attacking her before she even has a chance to do anything.
            I tried doing that, but she would always jump and summon before I could close the gap. Did you corner lock her or something?
                Now that I think about it I did push her back towards the statue each time so she didn't have far to run for that initial attack. I just stayed glued to her the entire time and she generally acted like she did in the first phase, but with the butterflies added in. The only time she managed to get off the summon after I started being so aggressive was when I'd jump away to heal.

Granted, I the only reason I was able to get so aggressive was because I practically memorized her patterns after days of dying over and over haha
                    Sounds like my experience with Genichiro. If that battle taught me anything, it was “don’t panic” and “for the love of god, the ogre should have taught you this, DON’T GET GREEDY!”
        You can also run around and occasionally hit the illusions at opportune times, which one shots them and replenishes shuriken charges
    You're there a bit too early if this is your first boss.

Should've fought the horseman first.
        MY NAME IS GYUBO ONIWA
            MY NAME IS GYUBO ONIWA *slashes the horse 5 times*
                BRAT!
        Oh is Gyubo considered the "first" boss? If that's the case, maybe there's hope for me yet! That's the fight where it first started feeling like I was getting a hang of the game.

I mean, he still kicked my ass a bunch of times, but once I got a good rhythm of deflecting his charges and grappling over the long sweep attack, it actually felt doable. Only had to use the firecrackers twice when I finally beat him!

^^And ^^then ^^the ^^bull ^^made ^^me ^^his ^^plaything...
            This is kinda what happened to me in dark souls 1. I went to the graveyard with the skeletons right after the tutorial, and kept fighting them until i could kinda kill a couple. Then i was like "fuck me this game isnt just hard its bullshit" then i found the eay to the aquaduct and started killing the undead there like 'oh... thiiiis is the first area'
                This was me in Dark Souls 2, lol
                    Not trying to be rude, but how? DaS2 starting area leads to 3 different areas, 1 which I'm sure won't find first time as it requires you to have a ton of Health or the ring that nullifies fall damage. So you really only have 2 paths the first time and neither of them leads to a high level area. One leads to the giant boss and the other to the big guy with armor (forgot it's name) and neither of them are hard or at least not late into the game hard. The guy with armor in particular, you can bait him and he'll kill himself by falling off the platform lol.
                        Probably Dragonrider area I’m guessing. I didn’t find it very hard either but the forest of giants is much easier to fight some easy enemies and level up a bit. The giant soldiers can be really aggravating if you’re new to the series.
            The real bosses drop memories. Mini bosses drop prayer beads.
                Except for the anomaly of Headless Ape which gives 2 prayer beads and a memory.
                ah, that's an easy distinction to remember. thanks!
            I'm with you on all this. That bull fight was stupid.
                Bull fight was a game changer. I had to rework my entire playstyle around the douche. I ended up using all my gourds, pellets, and rez to get that bastard down on the 5th go. The wiki really helped me out on the fight as well.
                    I'm back to getting my shit pushed in by Lady Butterfly and Ashina Elite.
                        You can cheese the Elite with the spear if you want.   He can't really deal with it.   Fighting fair is for samurai, not shinobi.
                        Easy strat for the elite: just deflect.

He has this double attack that you can bait if you stay on range. Just spam block once he starts charging it and then back away. 3-4 times and you can finish him. Do that twice and he's dead.

There are multiple bosses in the game in which spamming block and doing nothing else makes the whole fight completely trivial
            How did you get the firecracker before fighting him???
                Apparently firecrackers can be bought from the Mob merchant before the ogre, but I never found that the first time through.
                There's a memorial mob that sells it at the top of a cliff kind of near the old woman that gives you the bell. You have to grapple up to the top.
    It doesn't get easier, but there totally is an "aha" moment in regards to blocking/parrying being insanely powerful.
    My first 15-20 hours of playing, I just got wrecked over and over again, but then it finally 'clicked' for me and the game got a ton more fun.

There were definitely moments where I wasn't sure if I'd ever get good enough to really enjoy the game, but, I did, eventually.
    Lady Butterfly isn't the first boss. Shes an optional side quest boss that's fairly difficult. Come back to her later in the game.
    Butterfly is an optional boss, you actually don't even need to kill her.
    Dodge attack is your best friend, stick with it. We believe in you.
        Specifically for Lady Butterfly that works well. Pretty much every boss has a "simple" way to beat them

&#x200B;

>!Ogre - All of his attacks (except his one "fast" grab) are really really slow, at least by Sekiro enemy standards. He's also really difficult because you lack healing gourds and most people think you \*need\* to get two finisher blows on him unlike most other minibosses where you can get a sneak attack off. You can actually use Gacchin sugar to sneak up on the ogre - or aggro him and then lose aggro and get him much easier after he's broken free.!<

>!Gyoubu - Blocking works really well against him - you don't need to worry much about your posture because he gives you long breaks to recover posture - and a lot of free hits with the grapple-attack (if you have it). Firecrackers help, but definitely not necessary.!<

>!Blazin Bull - Even difficult on new game+, but if you deflect his charge like a matador you can wear his posture down before he kills you. Use dousing powder to keep from burning, and heal up when you get the chance. Also I've watched a lot of people struggle against him on streams/youtube but they don't seem to realize you can stay locked on to him and sprint around, which makes dodging him really really easy.!<

>!Guardian Ape - Pretty tough, since you really need deal a lot of vitality damage to end up beating him - but he has several attacks that leave him open for a few free hits. Also, you can still deflect him - I've seen many people not even try to block or deflect his attacks. They are erratic, but if you're disciplined in holding your block up you shouldn't get surprised too much.!<

>!Guardian Ape (headless) - The freaky factor puts a lot of people off, but his attacks are really telegraphed (easy to deflect or \*at least block\*), and if you can recognize his scream of terror then you shouldn't really even need to use pacifying agents. Also, the loaded spear (i think it's the spiral upgrade) deals massive damage to him if you can get him at the right time.!<

>!Guardian Ape (re-fight) - During the two ape portion of the fight the second ape doesn't attack super often, and it has lower vitality and breaks posture more easily - but if you keep your distance you can still probably take out the headless one and if you do then the second ape dies at the same time.!<

>!Genichiro - Attack when he isn't attacking, and deflect after he \*perfect\* deflects your strike. The timing is fairly easy to learn, and many sworded enemies have the same style where you attack until you get perfect deflected and then switch to something defensive. Deflect his jumping slash and it does a lot of posture damage. His second phase is still pretty tough, but if you can get the lighting reversal down then it's actually a really easy fight. Some of his timing and patterns are a little different, but he has the same basic attack patterns.!<

>!Long-arm centipede - Some people find him really easy but others struggle a ton on him. His flurry is really intimidating, but it only takes like two flurries to get his posture broken, and jump and stomp his head after his sweep for aton of posture damage.!<

Aaand there are others but i'm tired of typing. I'm sure there are better ways to beat them than what I've listed too, which is beautiful.
    Things click eventually, but pace yourself. Sekiro isn't one of these games you play for hours & hours each day (if you have the time in the first place). Understanding parrying & how to counter deathblows is key. 

If you're keen to try Lady Butterfly again there's a very easy tactic that doesn't even use blocking. When she attacks dodge to the right & use the dodge slash, then she'll kick again, dodge to the right & slash, on & on. Since you dodge out of the way she resets her combo & that slow kick is easy to dodge & since you're interrupting an attack from the side you're getting a proper hit in & she's not deflecting or guarding. When she jumps in the air, all you have to do is throw a shuriken & she'll fall on her face allowing you a couple hits.
    Another tip for lady butterfly if no one has said it already. You can get in 2 swings before she counter attacks so the pattern to whittle her posture down is attack attack deflect. Repeat that and pressure her enough to break her posture. If she jumps up Shuriken immediately and repeat if she gets knocked down. It’s all about breaking her posture
        Yet another tip; in phase two you don’t need snap seeds to dispel the illusions - just sprint around the perimeter until they go away!
    Shuriken her in the air, side step to her right. What combat art are you using?
Also if you figure out the single prosthetic that literally every animal-based boss is vulnerable too, that fight becomes a pretty big joke.
Genichiro is the line that divides people who know how to play the game and people who don't.

Later bosses are technically more impressive and difficult, but Genichiro is downright perfect. No tricks, no gimmicks, no cheesing. You just need to be good enough.
    I did lady butterfly first, and she was way harder for me.
Which is funny... As I thought Genichiro was ridiculously easy for a big fight, and struggled forever on Butterfly.  Each boss has a different rhythm that different people Excel at.  For me Genichiro is exact the type I like, patterned predictable low reaction speed boss.  He hits hard, but easy to wear down (for me, of course).

I also had killed just about every side boss and Lady butterfly before getting to him though...  So I likely had already struggled enough to get good at sword fights.  Spears...  Me and the mekiro counter don't get along.  High reaction speed fights like seven Spears or ashina elite I cheesed through with Spears and axes...
Same kinds thing happened for me in dark souls, I remember I had spent probably 45 minutes fighting the nameless king on my first playthrough which was just a grind of me throwing myself at him, something clicked and then when I started a new playthrough on ng+ I beat him on the first try. it's so satisfying to see visible improvement in these types of games.
Lmao
There are some user made mods, on PC at least, that let you show it down to your level.
    I have old man reflexes, and I get hard stuck on every boss and miniboss. Thanks for the tip. Maybe the 60$ wasn't wasted.
        Yeah I needed to take a break from this game because my old man reflexes just aren't working with this game. i've beaten 2 bosses... out of 13... just the thought of bosses being significantly more difficult than what I've already faced makes me wish I didn't buy the game. But the game is beautifully done... it's just not for us old guys
Its slowed in post. The game doesn't have 16:9 blackbars either. Whoever made this was trying to make it look cinematic
    They were trying to crop out the UI and figured this was the best way to do it, yeah.
        You can actually turn off the hud in the display settings.
    Judging by how smooth the movement looks when slowed down, I'm going to guess that the game was played and recorded with slowmo cheat, and then sped up in post. Unless it was being run with unlocked frame rate, and hitting a couple hundred FPS
        Pretty sure that the game is capped at 60 even on pc.
            i think there is mod that unlocks framerate
There is actually a program out right now that allows you to slow the game and speed up the player. It's as close to an easy mode as you can get for this game.
Theres a mod which you can use to slow down the animations of the enemies
    You can open the logo in ms paint and write "you win" under it, too
        Idk the name but if you search for the "i beat sekiro with cheats and i feel fine" article mentioned it, u can find it there
I just burned the mothafucka
Ok so, the skill ceiling in this game is quite high. But it *can* feel *very* repetitive early on, when it feels like you're just mashing attack over and over. But in general, the combat is very snappy and quick. A step beyond BB, and way behind Souls, in that regard.
Not the person you’re speaking too, but the combat is sensational. I will say I’m biased; having played and beat all previous souls games. That being said, if you were a fan of something like ninja gaiden or other oldschool hacknslash action titles and love a brutal challenge, this game is for you!
    ninja gaiden black is one of my fav games ever, loved the difficulty and gameplay, def getting sekiro now that i've seen this comparison.
        It really is the bastard love child of Ninja gaiden, dark souls, and tenchu
        You won’t regret it! I was a huge fan of ninja gaiden black as well. You’re gonna love sekiro.
They use it for throwing kunai at you if you're far enough
You can parry anything that isn’t a perilous attack.
    You can still parry stabs.
        You just have to shout MIKIRI COUNTER at the top of your lungs.
No, but if you quit before beating Gascoine you’ll probably quit before beating Genichiro too.

From Software games are not like God of War 3 at all. Their combat is far more tactical, requiring knowledge of enemy movesets and a feel for their timing.

Sekiro requires you to know enemy moves and their counters, and has 4 different basic defensive mechanics that you have to choose from at any given moment. Those are blocks, deflects, dodges, and jumps. Each defensive option has a counter, so none serve as a crutch. In order to survive you have to learn how to use them and be skilled enough to execute what you've learned.

The least-fun part of these games in my opinion is the learning part. You have to learn how to beat the game through trial and error. This is why dying is common. Different enemies and bosses require different strategies to beat and some of them are not obvious.

**I highly recommend watching YouTube videos on how to beat bosses you get stuck on.** I try to only look at those resources if I am out of ideas on how to evade a specific attack; learning the game is ultimately very rewarding so I recommend trying your damnedest to limit outside resources.
You don't have a stamina meter and all blocks block all physical damage, you can block through just about everything. Instead of stamina you (and enemies) have posture which increases as you block and get hit. This posture regerates slower as you (and enemies) lose hp. This makes the combat much more dynamic and forces "realistic" sword fights where you are trading blows, blocking, deflecting, and staying in each other's faces. Dodge roll is much worse than it was in DS/bb. Still great but not your number 1 defense. The trick to this game like the others is having the patience to learn. If you refuse to take the time to learn to stomp every enemy you see, two random dudes will still kill you. It takes me 20+ tries on a boss to beat them, but each death is "progress" as you learn even if you don't progress the story.
So happy I was able to hear all of this perfectly in my brain.
    Now I will have to hear it on my way home...
#Hey hey let's go! Kenka suru
#Taisetsu na mono o. protect my balls
#Boku ga warui, so let's fighting
#Let's fighting love
#Let's fighting love
Well, the Axe is the easiest weapon, Ludwig is a close second. The game is completely different played with a whip, a katana or a boom hammer.
    Damn I only play with the threaded cane. Was my first weapon I used and no matter how many times I say I’m going to play with the rapier gun I always end up with the threaded cane.
        Probably because it's a starting weapon, and you go in with the intent of playing a skill build. You get a few hours in and suddenly you have a +6 or +9 cane and you're just going to switch weapons? No way in hell!

That's always been a criticism I have had of the souls games, sometimes you just have to wait too long to get the weapon you want.

Boss weapons in the first DS for example. I have to get all the way to the Giant in Anor Londo before I can even think about boss weapons? Fuck that.

It's especially bad in Bloodborne because you almost never find weapons barring a few exceptions. There are also tons of extra gates to quickly obtaining them.
        Put on my top hat.

Light my cane on fire.

Bathe in the blood of beasts.
My first playthrough I fell into that habit and didn't realize how much I relied on just powering through hits then healing then my next playthrough I tried to use Dex and the katana and got my shit pushed in, lol.
No need to apologize, gaming is nostalgic for me too (I'm sure most gamers could agree)! I'm glad my comment was able to evoke that from you,  it was fun to read your experience.
"No, no. I said he ***doesn't*** row."   
"Ah."
Right tell me how to beat that raging fucking bull then
    Run behind it. Like, hold the run button and and constantly get in that ass.
    Use the firecracker tool. You'll note the description says it "scares beasts." Unless it's in the middle of some animations (or possibly there is a x-many-seconds cooldown, not sure), a firecracker will cause the bull to stop and rear up, letting you rush in and deal a bit of damage.   

Also, jump toward it and to the side when it's charging if you need to dodge. Enemies in this game often seem to have [Dark Souls 2](http://cdn.themis-media.com/media/global/images/library/deriv/722/722390.jpg) magnetism on many of their attacks. As such, Dodging is frequently worthless. Or it may just have very narrow windows in which to be effective. Either way, you're definitely better off jumping against this guy.
        Your exanarion of the busted dodging is a perfect summary. And it explains why I'm so stuck on madam whatsherface and the bull. 2 where you evidently need to be good at dodging lol
            No, it’s no about being good at dodging. Stop dodging. Learn to deflect. Deflect is your dodge button now. Dodge is your get killed button. You’re better off holding down that dodge button and sprinting away from an enemy 99% of the time rather than dodging.
            If you would like some help with that, I can give you some tips. If not, stop here. 

If Lady Butterfly is giving you trouble, start by learning to disengage. Just straight up run away. (Unless she's doing her big flying perilous attack, in which case run toward her.) Just keep an eye on her to block her ranged attacks just in case and run full tilt towards whichever is the far end of the room. Once you learn how far her attack combos go, you can run *just* outside of range and then turn and get in a couple punishing hits. 

Shuriken is fairly good at knocking her out of flying attacks, but I preferred to save my Spirit Emblems for the second phase. If you can't seem to get her dead, try coming back once you have the Umbrella tool and the Projected Force skill. Don't bother with snap seeds. You *want* her to have all her summons up, then just run around until she dismisses them into homing projectiles. Position yourself by a pillar to block a handful of them so as not to break your posture, but tank the brunt of them with the Umbrella up. Get close to her, and the Projected Force attack will knock like 1/5 of her HP off.
                Thanks for the tips! I'll try to worm on these as we as using the firecracker tool better
    Dont chase its butt.  Chasing butt is for hacks.

Wait for the bull to charge, and perfect parry when it runs straight at you head first.  You literally knock it on its ass and open it up to getting sliced and diced.
        Everyone who comments any other strategy than this one is wrong, and is doing it wrong, and is wasting theirs and your time. Parry that knockup head attack, get in 2-3 slices, back up and do it again. Throw in some firecrackers for extra hits. After about 5 parries, you'll fill his posture bar at only about half his vitality.
        WHAT?! The parry knocks it down?? I must have never had a successful parry on it then...
            It only knocks it down on certain attacks.  The key to the bull is to get some space and parry the attack when he runs at you, dips his head, and then tries to gore you.  It's easy as hell to parry and knocks him down.

The "stay behind the bull" people are giving you bad advice.  It's possible to do it that way, but it's way harder and it's teaching you bad habits for the rest of the game.  Parry >>>> dodging when possible for every single fight in the game except for one optional boss at the very end.
    Well, apart from gimmick bosses like that I'm referring to anything with a sword (or spear). But as for the raging bull in particular, try pretending you're a bullfighter :)
That record (which is now sub 27) uses a number of exploits, along with taking the shortest ending. Most people are going to run into the Immortal Severance ending with is considerably longer. Just doing that ending with no exploits is over an hour speed running IIRC.
I was also at the monkeys at roughly 30 hours in. I took my time exploring every little crevice though.
    I just beat monkeys 10 minutes ago at 28 hours. Kinda funny we all took roughly the same amount of time to get there even though I'm sure we all have different amounts of different areas explored. Neat that the game branches out and pretty much lets you do whatever until you're happy to continue the plot.

/u/Lorithias: Kill the brown monkey before finishing the headless chap. He's considerably weaker and then you can focus 1v1 again.
I think discovering Monks and Depths is totally legit before fighting Genichiro. Recommended in one sense with how much it helps you upgrade skills and collect prayer beads. That’s the way I went!

In general, I think Sekiro encourages the player to explore and beat mini bosses for beads before taking on main bosses.
Definitely; but since every interview and review insisted that this game was NOT a soulsborne, I had no way of knowing whether this game would be the same in that regard.
The actual bosses do get you to be better at the game, though. Lady Butterfly tip: ignore her illusions and just run around the edge of the arena until she dispels it. Also, Shuriken is godly in that fight.
    It's also far easier to so with another gourd seed and an attack up from the first full boss.  Trying to finish her off first is difficult.  I beat her the second try after coming back then.
    I found out last night when I finally managed to beat her that you can stop her from ever summoning the illusions if you keep pressure on her all through the second phase. She always appears by the big statue after the first deathblow so you can just run over and wait for her to appear and start attacking her before she even has a chance to do anything.
        I tried doing that, but she would always jump and summon before I could close the gap. Did you corner lock her or something?
            Now that I think about it I did push her back towards the statue each time so she didn't have far to run for that initial attack. I just stayed glued to her the entire time and she generally acted like she did in the first phase, but with the butterflies added in. The only time she managed to get off the summon after I started being so aggressive was when I'd jump away to heal.

>!Gyoubu - Blocking works really well against him - you don't need to worry much about your posture because he gives you long breaks to recover posture - and a lot of free hits with the grapple-attack (if you have it). Firecrackers help, but definitely not necessary.!<

>!Blazin Bull - Even difficult on new game+, but if you deflect his charge like a matador you can wear his posture down before he kills you. Use dousing powder to keep from burning, and heal up when you get the chance. Also I've watched a lot of people struggle against him on streams/youtube but they don't seem to realize you can stay locked on to him and sprint around, which makes dodging him really really easy.!<

>!Guardian Ape - Pretty tough, since you really need deal a lot of vitality damage to end up beating him - but he has several attacks that leave him open for a few free hits. Also, you can still deflect him - I've seen many people not even try to block or deflect his attacks. They are erratic, but if you're disciplined in holding your block up you shouldn't get surprised too much.!<

>!Guardian Ape (headless) - The freaky factor puts a lot of people off, but his attacks are really telegraphed (easy to deflect or \*at least block\*), and if you can recognize his scream of terror then you shouldn't really even need to use pacifying agents. Also, the loaded spear (i think it's the spiral upgrade) deals massive damage to him if you can get him at the right time.!<

>!Guardian Ape (re-fight) - During the two ape portion of the fight the second ape doesn't attack super often, and it has lower vitality and breaks posture more easily - but if you keep your distance you can still probably take out the headless one and if you do then the second ape dies at the same time.!<

>!Genichiro - Attack when he isn't attacking, and deflect after he \*perfect\* deflects your strike. The timing is fairly easy to learn, and many sworded enemies have the same style where you attack until you get perfect deflected and then switch to something defensive. Deflect his jumping slash and it does a lot of posture damage. His second phase is still pretty tough, but if you can get the lighting reversal down then it's actually a really easy fight. Some of his timing and patterns are a little different, but he has the same basic attack patterns.!<

>!Long-arm centipede - Some people find him really easy but others struggle a ton on him. His flurry is really intimidating, but it only takes like two flurries to get his posture broken, and jump and stomp his head after his sweep for aton of posture damage.!<

Aaand there are others but i'm tired of typing. I'm sure there are better ways to beat them than what I've listed too, which is beautiful.
Things click eventually, but pace yourself. Sekiro isn't one of these games you play for hours & hours each day (if you have the time in the first place). Understanding parrying & how to counter deathblows is key. 

If you're keen to try Lady Butterfly again there's a very easy tactic that doesn't even use blocking. When she attacks dodge to the right & use the dodge slash, then she'll kick again, dodge to the right & slash, on & on. Since you dodge out of the way she resets her combo & that slow kick is easy to dodge & since you're interrupting an attack from the side you're getting a proper hit in & she's not deflecting or guarding. When she jumps in the air, all you have to do is throw a shuriken & she'll fall on her face allowing you a couple hits.
Another tip for lady butterfly if no one has said it already. You can get in 2 swings before she counter attacks so the pattern to whittle her posture down is attack attack deflect. Repeat that and pressure her enough to break her posture. If she jumps up Shuriken immediately and repeat if she gets knocked down. It’s all about breaking her posture
    Yet another tip; in phase two you don’t need snap seeds to dispel the illusions - just sprint around the perimeter until they go away!
Shuriken her in the air, side step to her right. What combat art are you using?
I did lady butterfly first, and she was way harder for me.
I have old man reflexes, and I get hard stuck on every boss and miniboss. Thanks for the tip. Maybe the 60$ wasn't wasted.
    Yeah I needed to take a break from this game because my old man reflexes just aren't working with this game. i've beaten 2 bosses... out of 13... just the thought of bosses being significantly more difficult than what I've already faced makes me wish I didn't buy the game. But the game is beautifully done... it's just not for us old guys
They were trying to crop out the UI and figured this was the best way to do it, yeah.
    You can actually turn off the hud in the display settings.
Judging by how smooth the movement looks when slowed down, I'm going to guess that the game was played and recorded with slowmo cheat, and then sped up in post. Unless it was being run with unlocked frame rate, and hitting a couple hundred FPS
    Pretty sure that the game is capped at 60 even on pc.
        i think there is mod that unlocks framerate
You can open the logo in ms paint and write "you win" under it, too
    Idk the name but if you search for the "i beat sekiro with cheats and i feel fine" article mentioned it, u can find it there
ninja gaiden black is one of my fav games ever, loved the difficulty and gameplay, def getting sekiro now that i've seen this comparison.
    It really is the bastard love child of Ninja gaiden, dark souls, and tenchu
    You won’t regret it! I was a huge fan of ninja gaiden black as well. You’re gonna love sekiro.
You can still parry stabs.
    You just have to shout MIKIRI COUNTER at the top of your lungs.
Now I will have to hear it on my way home...
Damn I only play with the threaded cane. Was my first weapon I used and no matter how many times I say I’m going to play with the rapier gun I always end up with the threaded cane.
    Probably because it's a starting weapon, and you go in with the intent of playing a skill build. You get a few hours in and suddenly you have a +6 or +9 cane and you're just going to switch weapons? No way in hell!

That's always been a criticism I have had of the souls games, sometimes you just have to wait too long to get the weapon you want.

Boss weapons in the first DS for example. I have to get all the way to the Giant in Anor Londo before I can even think about boss weapons? Fuck that.

It's especially bad in Bloodborne because you almost never find weapons barring a few exceptions. There are also tons of extra gates to quickly obtaining them.
    Put on my top hat.

Light my cane on fire.

Bathe in the blood of beasts.
Run behind it. Like, hold the run button and and constantly get in that ass.
Use the firecracker tool. You'll note the description says it "scares beasts." Unless it's in the middle of some animations (or possibly there is a x-many-seconds cooldown, not sure), a firecracker will cause the bull to stop and rear up, letting you rush in and deal a bit of damage.   

Also, jump toward it and to the side when it's charging if you need to dodge. Enemies in this game often seem to have [Dark Souls 2](http://cdn.themis-media.com/media/global/images/library/deriv/722/722390.jpg) magnetism on many of their attacks. As such, Dodging is frequently worthless. Or it may just have very narrow windows in which to be effective. Either way, you're definitely better off jumping against this guy.
    Your exanarion of the busted dodging is a perfect summary. And it explains why I'm so stuck on madam whatsherface and the bull. 2 where you evidently need to be good at dodging lol
        No, it’s no about being good at dodging. Stop dodging. Learn to deflect. Deflect is your dodge button now. Dodge is your get killed button. You’re better off holding down that dodge button and sprinting away from an enemy 99% of the time rather than dodging.
        If you would like some help with that, I can give you some tips. If not, stop here. 

If Lady Butterfly is giving you trouble, start by learning to disengage. Just straight up run away. (Unless she's doing her big flying perilous attack, in which case run toward her.) Just keep an eye on her to block her ranged attacks just in case and run full tilt towards whichever is the far end of the room. Once you learn how far her attack combos go, you can run *just* outside of range and then turn and get in a couple punishing hits. 

Shuriken is fairly good at knocking her out of flying attacks, but I preferred to save my Spirit Emblems for the second phase. If you can't seem to get her dead, try coming back once you have the Umbrella tool and the Projected Force skill. Don't bother with snap seeds. You *want* her to have all her summons up, then just run around until she dismisses them into homing projectiles. Position yourself by a pillar to block a handful of them so as not to break your posture, but tank the brunt of them with the Umbrella up. Get close to her, and the Projected Force attack will knock like 1/5 of her HP off.
            Thanks for the tips! I'll try to worm on these as we as using the firecracker tool better
Dont chase its butt.  Chasing butt is for hacks.

Wait for the bull to charge, and perfect parry when it runs straight at you head first.  You literally knock it on its ass and open it up to getting sliced and diced.
    Everyone who comments any other strategy than this one is wrong, and is doing it wrong, and is wasting theirs and your time. Parry that knockup head attack, get in 2-3 slices, back up and do it again. Throw in some firecrackers for extra hits. After about 5 parries, you'll fill his posture bar at only about half his vitality.
    WHAT?! The parry knocks it down?? I must have never had a successful parry on it then...
        It only knocks it down on certain attacks.  The key to the bull is to get some space and parry the attack when he runs at you, dips his head, and then tries to gore you.  It's easy as hell to parry and knocks him down.

The "stay behind the bull" people are giving you bad advice.  It's possible to do it that way, but it's way harder and it's teaching you bad habits for the rest of the game.  Parry >>>> dodging when possible for every single fight in the game except for one optional boss at the very end.
Well, apart from gimmick bosses like that I'm referring to anything with a sword (or spear). But as for the raging bull in particular, try pretending you're a bullfighter :)
I just beat monkeys 10 minutes ago at 28 hours. Kinda funny we all took roughly the same amount of time to get there even though I'm sure we all have different amounts of different areas explored. Neat that the game branches out and pretty much lets you do whatever until you're happy to continue the plot.

/u/Lorithias: Kill the brown monkey before finishing the headless chap. He's considerably weaker and then you can focus 1v1 again.
It's also far easier to so with another gourd seed and an attack up from the first full boss.  Trying to finish her off first is difficult.  I beat her the second try after coming back then.
I found out last night when I finally managed to beat her that you can stop her from ever summoning the illusions if you keep pressure on her all through the second phase. She always appears by the big statue after the first deathblow so you can just run over and wait for her to appear and start attacking her before she even has a chance to do anything.
    I tried doing that, but she would always jump and summon before I could close the gap. Did you corner lock her or something?
        Now that I think about it I did push her back towards the statue each time so she didn't have far to run for that initial attack. I just stayed glued to her the entire time and she generally acted like she did in the first phase, but with the butterflies added in. The only time she managed to get off the summon after I started being so aggressive was when I'd jump away to heal.

Granted, I the only reason I was able to get so aggressive was because I practically memorized her patterns after days of dying over and over haha
            Sounds like my experience with Genichiro. If that battle taught me anything, it was “don’t panic” and “for the love of god, the ogre should have taught you this, DON’T GET GREEDY!”
You can also run around and occasionally hit the illusions at opportune times, which one shots them and replenishes shuriken charges
MY NAME IS GYUBO ONIWA
    MY NAME IS GYUBO ONIWA *slashes the horse 5 times*
        BRAT!
Oh is Gyubo considered the "first" boss? If that's the case, maybe there's hope for me yet! That's the fight where it first started feeling like I was getting a hang of the game.

I mean, he still kicked my ass a bunch of times, but once I got a good rhythm of deflecting his charges and grappling over the long sweep attack, it actually felt doable. Only had to use the firecrackers twice when I finally beat him!

^^And ^^then ^^the ^^bull ^^made ^^me ^^his ^^plaything...
    This is kinda what happened to me in dark souls 1. I went to the graveyard with the skeletons right after the tutorial, and kept fighting them until i could kinda kill a couple. Then i was like "fuck me this game isnt just hard its bullshit" then i found the eay to the aquaduct and started killing the undead there like 'oh... thiiiis is the first area'
        This was me in Dark Souls 2, lol
            Not trying to be rude, but how? DaS2 starting area leads to 3 different areas, 1 which I'm sure won't find first time as it requires you to have a ton of Health or the ring that nullifies fall damage. So you really only have 2 paths the first time and neither of them leads to a high level area. One leads to the giant boss and the other to the big guy with armor (forgot it's name) and neither of them are hard or at least not late into the game hard. The guy with armor in particular, you can bait him and he'll kill himself by falling off the platform lol.
                Probably Dragonrider area I’m guessing. I didn’t find it very hard either but the forest of giants is much easier to fight some easy enemies and level up a bit. The giant soldiers can be really aggravating if you’re new to the series.
    The real bosses drop memories. Mini bosses drop prayer beads.
        Except for the anomaly of Headless Ape which gives 2 prayer beads and a memory.
        ah, that's an easy distinction to remember. thanks!
    I'm with you on all this. That bull fight was stupid.
        Bull fight was a game changer. I had to rework my entire playstyle around the douche. I ended up using all my gourds, pellets, and rez to get that bastard down on the 5th go. The wiki really helped me out on the fight as well.
            I'm back to getting my shit pushed in by Lady Butterfly and Ashina Elite.
                You can cheese the Elite with the spear if you want.   He can't really deal with it.   Fighting fair is for samurai, not shinobi.
                Easy strat for the elite: just deflect.

He has this double attack that you can bait if you stay on range. Just spam block once he starts charging it and then back away. 3-4 times and you can finish him. Do that twice and he's dead.

There are multiple bosses in the game in which spamming block and doing nothing else makes the whole fight completely trivial
    How did you get the firecracker before fighting him???
        Apparently firecrackers can be bought from the Mob merchant before the ogre, but I never found that the first time through.
        There's a memorial mob that sells it at the top of a cliff kind of near the old woman that gives you the bell. You have to grapple up to the top.
Specifically for Lady Butterfly that works well. Pretty much every boss has a "simple" way to beat them

&#x200B;

>!Ogre - All of his attacks (except his one "fast" grab) are really really slow, at least by Sekiro enemy standards. He's also really difficult because you lack healing gourds and most people think you \*need\* to get two finisher blows on him unlike most other minibosses where you can get a sneak attack off. You can actually use Gacchin sugar to sneak up on the ogre - or aggro him and then lose aggro and get him much easier after he's broken free.!<

Apparently firecrackers can be bought from the Mob merchant before the ogre, but I never found that the first time through.
There's a memorial mob that sells it at the top of a cliff kind of near the old woman that gives you the bell. You have to grapple up to the top.
Thanks for the tips! I'll try to worm on these as we as using the firecracker tool better
Sounds like my experience with Genichiro. If that battle taught me anything, it was “don’t panic” and “for the love of god, the ogre should have taught you this, DON’T GET GREEDY!”
Not trying to be rude, but how? DaS2 starting area leads to 3 different areas, 1 which I'm sure won't find first time as it requires you to have a ton of Health or the ring that nullifies fall damage. So you really only have 2 paths the first time and neither of them leads to a high level area. One leads to the giant boss and the other to the big guy with armor (forgot it's name) and neither of them are hard or at least not late into the game hard. The guy with armor in particular, you can bait him and he'll kill himself by falling off the platform lol.
    Probably Dragonrider area I’m guessing. I didn’t find it very hard either but the forest of giants is much easier to fight some easy enemies and level up a bit. The giant soldiers can be really aggravating if you’re new to the series.
I'm back to getting my shit pushed in by Lady Butterfly and Ashina Elite.
    You can cheese the Elite with the spear if you want.   He can't really deal with it.   Fighting fair is for samurai, not shinobi.
    Easy strat for the elite: just deflect.
