[[Hesitation is defeat]]





Happens every time
Iâ€™ll never forget respawning at the DoH idol for the millionth time and running up to tickle his ballsack only for the giant UNSEEN AID kanji to appear right as heâ€™s stomping me into oblivion
    It is unseen aid. But not for you
    10/10
    Working on the DoH right now. Got so close last, night, had him to half health on his final phaseâ€¦ Went to fight him again but ran low on spirit emblems without noticing and ran out at the end of phase 2. I think im about 20 tries in, hopefully will beat him before 30. He seems so easy but goddamn I just keep mis-clicking buttons, healing when he sends fire skulls halfway through phase 2, or resurrecting right into his flame tornado.
I managed to get one useful unseen aid in my 3 playthroughs. Otherwise it just happens when I have 1 sen and XP and the lowest possible chance to get it
    Yeah. On one of my later playthroughs. I think I died 12ish times and didn't get it once. 30% chance my ass.
        30% yes but the odds are 70% to 30% itâ€™s usually most likely not gonna kick in ðŸ˜‚
    I don't understand why the chance of unseen aid goes up the more you die, at that point there's nothing worth saving and you're already throwing caution to the wind.
        It goes down. If you receive it more the more you die/less money you have it's just your shitty luck
I think they should let you choose to take unseen aid or not , and if you donâ€™t take it it raise the chance of receiving unseen aid the next time by 10%, and you can stack that up to 80%, and when you use it , it goes back down to 30% ... and by that I mean , if you were to receive unseen aid from the original 30% that youâ€™re able to pick, not just always
    I actually like that. Would make it actually useful
        I just wanted to say "actually" one more time.
            Actually, I do actually think that actually is an actually good idea.
Yeah, this is the one system in Sekiro that I would say is pretty weak. They put it in in order to give us an incentive to keep Dragonrot from spreading and see the drops of dragon blood as precious items akin to ephemeral eyes or humanity, but it wasn't enough to make me care. I spent the entire game with everyone under Dragonrot and only cured it before beating the last boss in case it affected the ending.
    You canâ€™t continue side quests with the dragon rot, you know?
        I was honestly too busy looking for bosses and protecting best boy Kuro than checking side quests. I did advance one or two, but I can understand why someone would just like to focus on the story and cure at the very end.
            To get the true ending I thought you had to complete a couple of the side quests. Such as the divine child.
                I got the so called "true" ending, which is Return without even watching a guide. Killed both snakes by talking to the divine child, and following the crazy directions of the granny that raises too many death flags (and by that I mean the second snake, getting to it was a pain, figuring out what to do was also painful). As far as I noticed, I never gave dragonrot to the divine child, the only NPC crucial to that ending. So I can assure you, you can get that ending without worrying about dragonrot. Purification on the other hand... no way to get that ending without a freaking guide... dragonrot is problematic there.
                    Shura was my first run. I was so disappointed.
                        Haha holy shit that sucks.  I did return since I had all the stuff for it.  I actually looked up online what would happen if you betrayed kuro cause it seemed like a huge dialogue option
                            They should let you change your mind honestly, I talked to that downed Tango thinking he'd be able to change my choice.
                                Flip-flopping is defeat.
                    Hmm Iâ€™m largely uninformed because Iâ€™m still fighting Isshin and donâ€™t want spoilers. I collected both viscera, but I already killed the divine dragon. So fuck me I guess.
                        Yea.  You need to actually evasdrop on Kuro and once on Emma/sculptor convo for another ending. 

And u might wanna pay regular visits to the surrounding areas of the Devine temple and meet the Devine child for another ending.

                        The diving child can not get dragon rot
                Is the true ending the purification or the return? Iâ€™m guessing the return?
                    Return is the true ending.
                        Eh Purification is, which is why >!we wont see Sekiro DLC or sequel.!<
                            Purification leaves the divine child thread hanging, return addresses everything. Which is why we will see another game....probably (I mean we havenâ€™t got another Bloodborne so who knows)
                                We havent seen another demon souls so the exclusives dont count.
                                    We got three sequels to Demon's Souls. Just cause they changed one word of the title doesn't mean anything.
                                Sequel from the Shura ending would be brutal 0.O
                                    Wouldn't it just become a dynasty Warriors game at that point where you mow down hundreds of enemies?
                            BOSS RUSH BABY
                                Isn't that what the base game is anyway? who kills enemies haha.
                    Imo itâ€™s Purification. Itâ€™s just more fitting to me. Return makes it looks like thereâ€™s a continuation but I think itâ€™s kinda inconsistent with Sekiroâ€™s character.
                    Iâ€™m not sure of the different endings because Iâ€™m still fighting Isshin, but itâ€™s the one where you do the quest with owlâ€™s memory
                        Purification then
                            Iâ€™m almost positive itâ€™s return, not purification
                                I was thinking the same, but in return I think you donâ€™t need to do owlâ€™s memory. Oâ€™m pretty sure you just need the snakesâ€™ organs and talking to the divine child, right?
                                    Yeah Return just requires the Viscera. Purification requires killing Owl father.
        WAIT THIS GAME HAD SIDE QUESTS???
            [deleted]
                Yeah I did, I think I set everyone to him
                    ðŸ˜¬
                        well... i guess thatâ€™s why it only took me like 26 hours to beat the game, Iâ€™ll do another play through when the update comes
        And? No offense, but the side missions other than Doujin were lame as shit.
    Also, max being 30% is just fucking stupid. If you're trying to encourage me to keep Dragonrot at bay, you're gonna have to do better than less than 1 out of every 3 times.
        If they had incorporated something where each person with Dragonrot reduces your max HP by 5%, now *that* would have had me panicking!

Although the game was definitely hard enough as is. So if they were going to do that, I'd say they should increase your base max HP to balance it out.
            I think it's a line. That would feel weird like the game is punishing you and it's already hard. Like DS2. Demon Souls kinda nailed it because even though it made the game harder, it gave you shit you wouldn't get otherwise.
    Ehh I had an opposite experience.  Yeah it would be pointless while fighting a boss and Ill admit it was annoying having to grind out the next level so you dont waste it all on a boss.  But it def did come in handy going through the level.  I also managed to keep people from getting the rot.  It only got bad during a couple boss fights and by the last one it doesnt matter bout dragonrot anyways since its end game.  It was a cool feature better than nothing.
    It's not a weak system if you die less
When you run to the demon of hatred but buddha decided to protect your 1 coin and made demon of hatred unseen because of the UNSEEN AID on the whole screen.
    Omfg yes.
How about when he blesses you 2 times in a row for the same 11 experience and 3 sen?
Thanks Buddha
    You're welcome son ðŸ™ƒ.
Did anyone else got really stressed out at first when dragon rot affected the Sculptor?

Thinking I won't be able to level up.

But by my 3rd playthrough I just let him cough it out
I swear unseen aid is just in the game to add to the frustration.  You just never get it when you have 74389 xp and 22846 sen but youâ€™ll get it like three times in a row when you have 1 sen and 2 xp
Hahahaha this is gold
    not much but we'll take it
If I pray to Drew and really mean it do I get to enter his pure land when I die?

I think Unseen Aid could easily be fixed by having it be 100% when pure, but you get one Dragon Rot every death which cuts Unseen Aid in half every time. Sen and current exp isn't precious enough for people to go out of the way in order to get a 1/3 chance of a safety net, but if it was a guaranteed safety net it would probably be enticing enough to get people to cure Dragon Rot.
    It legit felt like the started it as a world tendency mechanic a la Demon's Souls and then just fucking bailed on it.

Also, Sen is kinda useless after 1 PT and EXP is as well. I know the dragon mask can convert it, but it's legit easier to just go through bosses.
Buddha protecting me with my empty wallet and no exp during the isshin fight because he feels bad.
Sending this to my dad cause he can't beat genichiro at all lmao
Hey, every little helps! Keep saving and you'll have your own spirit emblem in no time.
I kid you not I have like a 90% unseen aide. My first playthrough I didn't read the tutorial so I thought it gave me a temporary buff in attack or made the game easier for awhile because Id do better after seeing it.
    I can see how you would think that, honestly
        Someone should make a mod that gives you a small unseen aide buff to damage taken to HP and posture and status build up (fire, terror, etc.). Maybe have it active for like 5 minutes and gradually taper off.
            Not a bad idea. It really needs more of a function. It was kind of just a useless mechanic. I do, however, think people becoming infected w/dragonrot from your repeated deaths was pretty genius. I had to cure it to complete npc questlines a few times. It's a unique concept
                Emma should of been susceptible to it. Cure that dragon rot or no gourd seed enhancements. Of course only after curing it once to prove you know how to.
I mean I know Buddha tried to emphasize spiritual gains over material ones but c'mon now
Now all my homies hate buddha
Wait you guys have sen and xp ?
This gave me ptsd
Fank Yew BooDa
It seems like a really pointless mechanic imo, it's never been helpful or devastating to any playthrough.
The scene in The wedding singer when Adam Sandler is mad at his fiance for not turning up at the wedding springs to mind
Donâ€™t worry. Iâ€™ll be losing that soon too.
Thanks Buddha, very...yeah.
Yeah I really appreciate this when i'm killed by a boss for the 15th time. I don't think there's ever been anytime when this was actually of use to me.
Thanks Buddha
Help comes in mysterious ways
Well most of our deaths is when we're re-trying certain bosses over and over and over again, so it makes sense that Unseen Aid would appear more often when we've already lost so many times.

Wonder if the devs can reserve the Unseen Aid from when it detects us repeatedly attempting bosses?
You must always be grateful to Buddha
The first time i received unseen aid i thought it was a super cool hidden mechanic. Lmao
Nice one dude
Does somebody know what the actual kanji mean? I tried to translate it but it doesn't make sense that way.
    It means "divine protection," and the kana is an irregular verb meaning "to have."
I can't even count how many time this happened to me in the 7-10 days worth of DoH attempts.
I once got this like 4 times in a row dying to Genichiro/Isshin lol
This is kind of a bizarre mechanic. Feels kinda unfinished to me. Like, if Sekiro had the "death run" mechanic of the souls game, and Unseen Aid worked like a Ring of Sacrifice, Unseen Aid might seem more useful, but as is, I just ignore it lol
Who tf cares about the sen man kotaro is dying :''''(
Idk bout you guys but unseen aid has helped me a few times
Maybe I'm a bummy casual who always grinded easy enemies when I was getting close to the next skill point, but this was literally the only circumstances under which I'd get Unseen Aid.
Lmao just beat Isshin yesterday. Started from no dragonrot and ended up spreading it to the crow mobs. Unseen aid dropped in sometimes to save my 1 exp and 1 sen that cannot be lowered any further. This one hits hard lol
No need to thank me
"Hesitation is defeat" is what got me through that boss fight.
Unseen aid is the most useless mechanic in any game ever. Change my mind.
Been stuck on Isshin for 2 days :(
Oh hey, it's me during my 7 hour marathon session fighting DoH yesterday... I beat him, though
I have never gotten good use out of unseen aid
Iâ€™m on my first ever play through and I just reached this boss. What the fuck is that 3rd phase......
Me in my first playthrough.

But seriously, idk what to spend my 40K sen on :/
Thanks, I hate it
How did this game go from impossible to so easy to the point where I dont try
Me after dying to the headless ape for the 25th time and the dragon rot on every possible character
ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£
Fuck you. Take my upvote.
Dear Buddha,

Where were you when I lost 36,000 XP?


Sincerely,


One pissed off wolf with a blade that can kill you
thanks n0tail
Every time. If I have 5000 sen and an almost full bar even have 30% chance won't save me.

If I have 2 sen and 30 exp though...
Lol!
ðŸ˜‚
I got 5 unseen aids between genichiro and that bitch right before him
1 sen and no xp
Fucking literally me just a few minutes ago. Just beat the game for the first time, trying to grab the screenshot I took off Steam, oh, what a finale!
What an extra kick to the dick this is
u/MandyBSreal
He feels bad at this point
I always treat it as a joke, but one time I got saved after walking into a boss room accidentally. So grateful for it.
For real though. It seems like it procks way more when you have nothing left to lose than when you have everything else to lose lol ðŸ˜‚. Like I kid you not. Like 4 times in a row after dying a million times and I had 1xp and 1 sen so it wouldnâ€™t have done much anyways lmfao ðŸ¤£ itll always get ya every time
It is unseen aid. But not for you
10/10
Working on the DoH right now. Got so close last, night, had him to half health on his final phaseâ€¦ Went to fight him again but ran low on spirit emblems without noticing and ran out at the end of phase 2.

Yeah. On one of my later playthroughs. I think I died 12ish times and didn't get it once. 30% chance my ass.
    30% yes but the odds are 70% to 30% itâ€™s usually most likely not gonna kick in ðŸ˜‚
I don't understand why the chance of unseen aid goes up the more you die, at that point there's nothing worth saving and you're already throwing caution to the wind.
    It goes down. If you receive it more the more you die/less money you have it's just your shitty luck
I actually like that. Would make it actually useful

                            Yeah Return just requires the Viscera. Purification requires killing Owl father.
WAIT THIS GAME HAD SIDE QUESTS???

        Yeah I did, I think I set everyone to him
            ðŸ˜¬
                well... i guess thatâ€™s why it only took me like 26 hours to beat the game, Iâ€™ll do another play through when the update comes
And? No offense, but the side missions other than Doujin were lame as shit.
If they had incorporated something where each person with Dragonrot reduces your max HP by 5%, now *that* would have had me panicking!

Although the game was definitely hard enough as is. So if they were going to do that, I'd say they should increase your base max HP to balance it out.
    I think it's a line. That would feel weird like the game is punishing you and it's already hard. Like DS2. Demon Souls kinda nailed it because even though it made the game harder, it gave you shit you wouldn't get otherwise.

Someone should make a mod that gives you a small unseen aide buff to damage taken to HP and posture and status build up (fire, terror, etc.). Maybe have it active for like 5 minutes and gradually taper off.
    Not a bad idea. It really needs more of a function. It was kind of just a useless mechanic. I do, however, think people becoming infected w/dragonrot from your repeated deaths was pretty genius. I had to cure it to complete npc questlines a few times. It's a unique concept
        Emma should of been susceptible to it. Cure that dragon rot or no gourd seed enhancements. Of course only after curing it once to prove you know how to.
Actually, I do actually think that actually is an actually good idea.
To get the true ending I thought you had to complete a couple of the side quests. Such as the divine child.
    I got the so called "true" ending, which is Return without even watching a guide. Killed both snakes by talking to the divine child, and following the crazy directions of the granny that raises too many death flags (and by that I mean the second snake, getting to it was a pain, figuring out what to do was also painful). As far as I noticed, I never gave dragonrot to the divine child, the only NPC crucial to that ending. So I can assure you, you can get that ending without worrying about dragonrot. Purification on the other hand... no way to get that ending without a freaking guide... dragonrot is problematic there.
        Shura was my first run. I was so disappointed.
            Haha holy shit that sucks.  I did return since I had all the stuff for it.  I actually looked up online what would happen if you betrayed kuro cause it seemed like a huge dialogue option
                They should let you change your mind honestly, I talked to that downed Tango thinking he'd be able to change my choice.
                    Flip-flopping is defeat.
        Hmm Iâ€™m largely uninformed because Iâ€™m still fighting Isshin and donâ€™t want spoilers. I collected both viscera, but I already killed the divine dragon. So fuck me I guess.
            Yea.  You need to actually evasdrop on Kuro and once on Emma/sculptor convo for another ending. 

And u might wanna pay regular visits to the surrounding areas of the Devine temple and meet the Devine child for another ending.

            The diving child can not get dragon rot
    Is the true ending the purification or the return? Iâ€™m guessing the return?
        Return is the true ending.
            Eh Purification is, which is why >!we wont see Sekiro DLC or sequel.!<
                Purification leaves the divine child thread hanging, return addresses everything. Which is why we will see another game....probably (I mean we havenâ€™t got another Bloodborne so who knows)
                    We havent seen another demon souls so the exclusives dont count.
                        We got three sequels to Demon's Souls. Just cause they changed one word of the title doesn't mean anything.
                    Sequel from the Shura ending would be brutal 0.O
                        Wouldn't it just become a dynasty Warriors game at that point where you mow down hundreds of enemies?
                BOSS RUSH BABY
                    Isn't that what the base game is anyway? who kills enemies haha.
        Imo itâ€™s Purification. Itâ€™s just more fitting to me. Return makes it looks like thereâ€™s a continuation but I think itâ€™s kinda inconsistent with Sekiroâ€™s character.
        Iâ€™m not sure of the different endings because Iâ€™m still fighting Isshin, but itâ€™s the one where you do the quest with owlâ€™s memory
            Purification then
                Iâ€™m almost positive itâ€™s return, not purification
                    I was thinking the same, but in return I think you donâ€™t need to do owlâ€™s memory. Oâ€™m pretty sure you just need the snakesâ€™ organs and talking to the divine child, right?
