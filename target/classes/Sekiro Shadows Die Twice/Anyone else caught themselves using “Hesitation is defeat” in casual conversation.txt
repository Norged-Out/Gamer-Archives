[[Anyone else caught themselves using “Hesitation is defeat” in casual conversation]]


That line. It’s seared into my brain because I heard it so many damn times, and because it’s so damn good. My dad missed a turn a few days ago due to hesitation and it bubbled to the surface. I didn’t even catch it at first.


That line is actually genius.


Think about when Your hp is low you freak out and hesitate to fight due to your fear of failing and that hesitation leads to your defeat.

That's how I beat owl i stopped paying attention to my hp when it went low and focused on dodging blocking and fighting and in the end I won despite how low my Hp was.
    It’s honestly brilliant, and says so much about Isshin himself. To defeat the demon of Ashina, you must become an even greater devil yourself. As long as I was scared of Isshin, his second form would absolutely thrash me. I was only able to defeat him when I decided it was he who should fear me, and played as such.
        Yeah that fight for me goes like this:
Genichiro- that was a fight?
Isshin 1st phase- I can do this
2nd- "hesitation is defeat" x10000
3rd- the lighting just makes it so easy
            Genichiro is a headstrong boy playing with powers he doesn’t understand, and is easily dealt with. Isshin’s first form is a test of mastery. If you can properly counter, he isn’t difficult. His second form is a test of courage. You know how to fight, but do you know how to win? His third form is a test of nerves. You’ve proven you can gain the victory, but will your own anxiety betray you? When the moment comes, will you seize it? Will you hesitate?

That fight in particular is absolute poetry. I’m getting excited just thinking about it.
                ugh god damn. my vr headset came in the mail when I got to the ministry invasion at ashina castle. haven't picked it up since. 

but this comment. 


I need to finish the game.
                    You do. The last battle is my all time favorite video game boss, and I’ve been playing games for almost thirty years. The entire game has been training you for that one encounter, and it is sublime.
                        Good to know...I just started 2 days ago and I'm getting my ads handed to.

Trying not to be scared of the big stuff.

I'm stuck in 2 places...a general..and some huge sumo  guy.

My favorite parts have been when I can be stealthily and kill things..love the tenchu vibe.
                            The amazing thing about Sekiro is that it’s several games in one. In the beginning, before you have a larger health bar and access to many skills, it’s well played as a stealth-style Tenchu game. As you progress, you’ll find yourself relying on stealth less and less as you hone yourself into a peerless warrior. Sekiro is a harsh master, but it has much to teach if you’re willing to learn.
                                Good to know.

Always something to learn and I'm willing to learn.I died like 50 times or more to that red eyed ogre till I finally got it right.

I need to focus more,practice my timing and be more aggressive and not worry about getting hit because I'm going to get hit.

I just feel like I'm missing something..and I'm not sure what it is.

I'm not as fluid as I should be,I feel clumsy and that frustrates me.
                                    You’ll get there. The red eyed ogre is weak to fire, and you’re not explicitly told to follow another path until you get a fire weapon. The game will feel frustrating and impossible, until it doesn’t. At some point during some boss fight, it’ll click. You’ll stop reacting and start flowing. You’ll anticipate and punish mistakes without even realize you’re doing it. Once you start viewing deflections as another avenue of attack, you’re well on your way. And never forget...

Hesitation is defeat.
                        Couldn't agree more with this. I just beat him today and I feel amazing!!!
                            You didn’t hesitate.
                        This
                    Do it, Sekiro!
                    >ugh god damn. my vr headset came in the mail when I got to the ministry invasion at ashina castle

do you mind me asking which games you're playing? I got a PSVR a while ago and had fun for like a week, now it's just collecting dust. Firewall doesn't let you mute people, Skyrim VR has horrible movement, and the other VR games are kinda short
                        Not OP but blood and truth is badass. Also I’m enjoying wipeout and To the Top.
                            Didn't know WipeOut was on PSVR I played that game nonstop on my PSP back in the day. I'll also check out the other two, thanks! I have sunshine Arizona which was alright and Archangel really missed the mark for me. I really want BeatSaber but I'll have to wait till the MonsterCat bundle goes on sale
                                Also it goes without saying but Astrobot is a ton of fun. Moss is a good substitute as well. 

Have fun!
                        ah wish I could help you. I'm on pc. I know the psvr market is pretty hurting game wise. Superhot VR is probably one of my faves that are on there. it's really fun. the throwing mechanic is sorta spotty due to poor tracking but it's still a solid experience and loads of fun. Beatsaber I've heard is a blast too. Same with that Creed boxing game. My buddy has a psvr and has the same complaints as you but he enjoys those three the most. I'm sure you've already tried them though and they fall under the "kinda short" part of your reply. 


but as for pc I play Pavlov VR (literally counterstrike VR), Minecraft VR, Sairento VR and Blade and Sorcery. If any of those come out on PSVR scoop them up asap. 

those have been my top 4 lately. 

it's a shame vanilla skyrim vr is so shit. it's pretty dece with mods but without them it's just a nightmare. 


psvr I feel is doing more damage to the VR scene than good. Sure it's allowing access to lower price ranges but it seems to be putting out a "VR is DOA" message to people. The psvr got stale after a couple weeks for me and my friend that I was staying with a few months ago, yet I've been playing my vive for probably 2 months straight now since I've gotten it. 


If you're really into VR I cannot reccomend the vive enough. As far as looks go sure there's better headsets out there currently. but the tracking is phenomenal. no worrying about facing your psvr camera all the time, no tracking black outs. it's a phenomenal step up from the psvr imo plus it has the games to back it up. 


this is how I justified spending the money:

1 year ago I built a gaming pc. made sure components would be up to par for vr in the future. went with an AMD build to save money vs Intel. it helped I was heavily addicted to rocket league at the time and the performance upgrade compared to ps4 brought me up a solid 2 divisions. 

then the following year I decided to say fuck it and ordered the headset on sale for 600 bucks CAD. I was stressing out big time about spending the cash until it came. once I played it tho all my regrets went out the window and I can honestly say it was an amazing purchase. 


anyway this reply got WAY out of hand hahaha take er easy kind gold stranger
                            I'm really looking into getting an oculus quest since it's so portable
                >His third form is a test of nerves.

"C'mon Isshin, GIMME THAT LIGHTNING!!"
                    "BITCH, I AM THUNDER!"
                Fucking, THIS, dude! It's so true.
                Gonna copy this because it's beautiful
            This is literally how the boss fight went for me. The second phase is the whole boss fight. The first phase was also honestly quite intense as you had to be constantly up his ass to deal any posture damage. The second phase was brutal. You can't get too close to him because he just knocks you out with his spear, or be too far because he whips out his gun and takes out a massive chunk of your health which you can't heal back as Isshin just will not let you. The third phase is comparable to Genichiro, I did not take a hit. The first and second phase have to be played with precision, and one small mistake and you're pretty much screwed unfortunately.
        Same thing he made me quit the game for 3 weeks. But then I came back and said, "This is just another boss, I've been through a lot worse than a dude with a sword and a spear" and just started pummeling him nonstop (of course he killed me 18 more times).
Specialy satisfiying when you decide not to fear the lighning attacks and just throw them back at him!!! SO GOOD
        this is an absolutely brilliant way to put this.
    I really like this explanation because it fits the spirit of the game perfectly. Focusing on the fight should be your number one priority, because in reality you shouldn’t need to use your healing items of upgrades. A truly skilled shinobi could come out of a fight unharmed by their enemy.
        I think that's the intention.


Lore wise i think Wolf only dies twice.

Once in the hirata Estate memory

Again when he first drew the Mortal Blade.

If that's true then Wolf may never have need to use healing items that much
            Found my inspiration for a new speedrun type! “Play the game as canonically intended, without teleporting or dying outside the intended number of times”
                So basically a no death, no teleporting run since both those deaths happen in cutscenes?
                If it’s no teleporting how do you get from the Depths back to Ashura Castle?
                    Glitches

Duh
                    Knowing the speed running community, I’m sure there’s an exploit that can be found.
                    Do the depths last and use the scripted teleport
                        There’s a scripted teleport?
                            wait I confused myself with when the dragon teleports you back to ahina castle
                I think Happy Hob did a no-hit run... not sure if he teleported.
            I believe he also ends up dying after losing his arm. But I’m not 100% sure.
                Na the sculptor brings you back. You were on the brink of death but didnt die there.
    The only flaw in that logic is that your low hp also means lower hp gauge, and that actually makes fighting harder and keeping your hp high a priority for most players.
        But as long as you deflect, your posture won't break.
        \*posture
        But again, by focusing purely on the fight, slower posture regen shouldn’t even be an issue; as long as your timing is spot-on and you can deflect perfectly, your posture bar will never break. In the end it all goes back to never hesitating and just diving right into the thick of it.
    On the flip side, though, rushing can just as easily lead to defeat! How many times have you seen the boss is on 1mm hp, and throw caution to the wind, only to get killed by an easily avoided attack?
    This description is the best to explain it all.

To defeat these "harder" enemies, you literally need to find another state of mind.
    We Ultra Instinct now boys.
    I took the opposite. Just beat owl after 49 tries with the bell on when it took me two without. I got to the point where I had his attack patterns down and just let him come to me and punished his openings.

I couldn't figure out how to be aggressive but also avoid poison so I just stepped off when it came to that.

Rushing in is a form of hesitation
    That's how I won against isshin: realized I had no more healing gourds while starting third phase, just said fuck it, I will just dodge his shock attack (countering it takes a little health) and play everything else perfectly, ended up taking like one hit and beat him.
    FR you really just gotta go the fuck in on this man. I got to him and beat him same day because I fully realized that. My friend who told me you have to be aggressive in this game is still stuck on isshin because he worries too much about getting fucked, but the secret is you just have to turn the tables and make it so isshin is "worried" about you and not the other way around.
    I was literally just in NG+ facing Orin. The first phase, I went through 10 gourd. The second phase, she killed me and I res'd. I literally furrowed my brow and said "hesitation is defeat" and proceeded to whoop her ass without taking any damage by focusing on her rhythms and breaking down her posture slowly. It was amazing. It really feels like Isshin taught me how to own at this game.
    Soooo true when i was fighting owl at hirata my hp was probably 1/3. And insteading of running away i held my ground then i ended up getting his first life marker. Then unaware of his second form i died. But that line should guide you for the game.
    That’s how I beat the bridge night actually, and my hp was so low when I pushed him off, a small tap from a child could have killed me.
        A small child named Robert
    This is a good NO HUD game.  I understand it in shooting games but can't manage that inventory.
Often, usually after I mikiri counter someone's attempt at a handshake
    The image that creates is absolutely hilarious
        https://media1.giphy.com/media/Q3Xy7ajdYudIQ/giphy.gif
            It's like that but I also throat punch them
            ...what the fuck is going on in that gif?
                Mikiri counter handshake! 

Or more specifically speaking- that’s Trump’s signature handshake, asserting himself unto his victim. 

[Here’s a video of the president of Portugal beating him to the punch](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&source=web&cd=&ved=0ahUKEwiJl-O96t_iAhWRmlkKHdHMBo8QzPwBCAM&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fworld%2Famericas%2Ftrump-handshake-portugal-president-rebelo-de-sousa-white-house-a8422741.html&psig=AOvVaw225qQyO6KagXIwy0zo0h9u&ust=1560287624239744)
                    Jesus politicians are childish.
            god he is so fucking fat.
        As if using the mikiri against the Lone Shadows' thrust kick wasn't hilarious enough, lol
    With the eye contact for increased posture damage.
        Leave them on the ground in a confused pile of pain. Shout out, “Oh how my blood boils!” as you seek out your next foe.

    lest ye be defeated and spread dragonrot to those with whom ye speak
No, but I have a phd meeting tomorrow and I’ll promise to slip the line in
    Make sure to not hesitate
    I’ll hold you to that.
the more i heard it from isshin, the more i wanted to f\*\*king kill him, 

...but then the i died even more and heard it again
    Hesitation is defeat, but recklessness? You’ve lost before you’ve begun.
My wife said that to me the other day when I realized I forgot to mail something.

Immediately brought me some PTSD and I was so proud of her.
    \[X\] Doubt
        Nothing ever happens
Well I've certainly found myself using the word "inauspicious" more often lately.
Mayuii mayabureru...
    Mayoeba yabureru
        My apologies, I spelled it wrong :/
        Hey, just a question since you look like you know the Japanese line, do you know what the Kanji for the phrase is? It might be an interesting illustration idea. Thanks!
            I don't know Japanese myself but according to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sekiro/comments/bbeo2h/hesitation_is_defeat/) it'd be written out as:

迷えば敗れる
                Thanks man!
    Unagi usagi onigiri
        Is that the language or the symbols?
            Hai.
    Umm what?
        That's the japanese line
        Japanese voice sounds like this, I guess
I used it in a destiny 2 raid this evening.
    Crown of sorrow?
        Last wish a clan mate panicked during the vault and missed his slam because he thought the ad was going to push him but ad died and he still missed the cleanse. So you know hesitation is defeat. Lol
        Crown of Sorrow is 3 years old?!?!?
I straight up made a homebrew trait for one of my D&D characters called "Hesitation is Defeat"
\*Failing to stomp on a centipede in my bathroom that ran too fast\*

Me: "Shit, hesitation is defeat indeed"
    the mortal foot.
I have a problem with overthinking stuff. I want to talk to someone and I'm waiting for the perfect moment, think how to start the conversation, and in the end I'm getting stresed out. But I took Isshin's advice to heart, and I try to "just do it" without hesitation. So yes, it helps. :)
That and “impressive boy” 

Sometimes your first boss fight is the hardest😪
I use it as my faint shoutout in Monster Hunter now (text that displays in multiplayer on certain actions). Gives me a chuckle whenever I die now.

I didn't really die too much to SS though, took me like 10 attempts. Lady Butterfly killed me the most at the very beginning of the game.
    I’d take SSI over granddaddy Isshin any day!
I started making it my personal mantra to avoid procrastination. It's such an inspirational line.
Beautiful dialog. Beautiful game. I just cannot describe how much I love this game. 

I must remember to use that line in conversation.
said it while playing cornhole at a grad party -_-
As a shut in paralyzed by having to plan and analyze everything, I have adopted it as my new Nindo.
    You can break out of your shell, friend. I believe in you. The fact that you’re trying is enough; through effort and pain, you will stand victorious.
Just had a situation where that line would fit like 2 seconds ago.
    You hesitated.
It’s the same concept as “you snooze you lose” except “hesitation is defeat” sounds way cooler. I’m a truck driver and i also think about that phrase every time I could have made a turn but I waited too long. I’ve beat the game about 5 times now and I’ve got the entire game rooted in my brain.
I use that and “Oh how my blood boils!!” all the time
Yes, i always implement game monologue in casual conversations. Especially if it's said by samurai.
Fuck i did wth
I love that phrase for three reasons:  1). I heard it sooo many times 2). It is so true 3) only when I I didn’t hesitate did I finally beat ISS - he was telling you how to defeat him with every loss.
YES
It just comes out of my mouth and I can’t stop it.
I've never even said it on this board.
Nah but I keep saying farewell when I kill old ppl..... thought that was weird, makes sense now tho
I'm saying this all the time since i heard and I'm always disappointed no one knows it
    Nobody you know is good enough to have reached Isshin. Hesitaters, every one of them.
        More like people i know don't play games :'(
            I know that feel, and I hate it. Their loss. They’ll never know the pure, sublime joy of banging your head against a boss, slowly getting better, winning, and coming out the other side as more than you were.
Today at work i was driving a forklift in the mud, and got stuck when i slowed down because i hesitated. Hesitation is defeat
I don’t know if I’d call it ‘casual’ conversation, but when I play Apex with friends and I get in particularly hectic situations such as the two of them getting downed, leaving me to face a whole squad alone, I frantically repeat “HESITATION IS DEFEAT” until I either kill said squad and revive my teammates or until I die.
Just killed the black hat badger accidently, saw him by the kite and rushed over thinking he was a rat and bam! Hesitation is defeat but only fools rush in...
I heard it at least 60 times.
I use "hesitation kills" in traffic. Does that count?
Yeah, it really is brilliant and it does pop into my head during casual conversation sometimes. I must've heard the fucker say those words about 100 times.
The boss tells you how to beat him with this line
I've been using Akali's "Hesitation is the seed of defeat" from league of legends for years. It's a good line. Both are.
My cousin got into Sekiro and it’s been amazing watching someone who doesn’t know a thing about the game trying to figure out how the hell this game works. I’ve beaten it and I feel the intense flow of taking down these enemies. Now every time I watch him die to bosses and can see the confusion and slight frustration, I tell him ‘hesitation is defeat’ and I continue to tell him that and I feel as though the line itself has immense power.
I have been stuck here for way too long. I can assure you. Hesitation truly is defeat.
    Be bold. Be fierce. Be relentless. A wolf can eat a demon if it’s hungry enough.
I say that to all my friends when we play apex legends. It’s searing into their brains as we speak😂😂😂
That and "don't be sorry, be better."
Hell yeah man, heard this so many times. I say this to myself all the time if I’m making decisions and it never fails me. If I see an opportunity, I’m taking it
    It’s a good way to look at life. Don’t rush in recklessly, but take opportunities without holding yourself back. Hesitation is defeat.
That's my new motto for picking up women.
    I mean, it's true enough to be. If you try, the worst they say is "no," but hesitation? Immediate defeat.
no
I actually used this the other day. I got home from work and the deadbolt on my door was unlocked even though I could’ve sworn I locked it, so I searched the house with a knife just to be cautious because I just moved to this neighborhood and I don’t know much about it still. The house was clear so I told my friend about it and I told him I would not hesitate to start stabbing if someone was broken into my house, because Hesitation is Defeat.
I used it yesterday when teaching my fiance how to defend herself against an attacker.
If you deflect all the attacks perfectly u wont need health... EZ
Always
I was lucky enough to know about the quote before playing and it helped me beat Gyoubu Oniwa when he was close to a death blow and I had a slither of hp left.
No but I find myself to curse a lot, that might be related to Sekiro aswell.
I do when I play Apex. In my head bloodhound would be the one to say it.
I would meme on my girlfriend about it, whenever I’d die to Isshin I’d lean over and say “Oh by the way Hestitation is Defeat.”
    >Reply

LOL, that's great!
Defeat the hesitation
I feel the same way, it left such an impact after hearing it 1000 times. I notice myself adhering to that mantra in other stuff like Dota.
I think its safer your dad hesitated to take a turn rather than doing a kansai drifto into the turn haha
No, im spanish so it would be really weird xD
Actually the original quote is from Ed Parker (or his protege, Tracy) and is:  He who hesitates, levitates. Parker was a kenpo master and responsible for bringing and promoting Bruce Lee when he came to America.
My fiance can't stand how often I say if you hesitate you die
No, but I've used the concept that hesitation is defeat in other games.
Lemme tell you:
I am an illustrator when not at my day job. I'm working on one piece I'm doing, a tribute to American gods. When using pen and ink, hesitation truly is defeat. BUT: there are workarounds and you can utilize mistakes to your advantage since art allows that. So this is more in the technique aspect of using that medium. Pen and ink requires your utmost confidence to use it effectively and efficiently.
You are allowed to make mistakes. You are not allowed to hesitate.
You know it's even actually a good motto to live by. It reminds you that you must always be certain, decisive, and confident on whatever you put your mind into. You'll become a more powerful individual eventually when you stop overthinking or hesitating and just committing to action and taking responsibility.
They use the same line in Bleach the anime. If you like it so much go watch the anime.
    I’ve watched plenty of Bleach. Certain fights and certain storylines are wonderful, but many are really bad. Rurouni Kenshin is the true Sekiro anime.
        Amen! Also, Samurai Champloo is a good rurouni anime. Watched it because i got back into japanese lore cause of Sekiro and when i found out it was created by the guy who made Cowboy Bepop , i didn't hesitate to watch it.
            I can’t decide which is more Sekiro, Saito vs Kenshin or Kariya vs Jin. Actually, scratch that. Kenshin stops hesitating as he reverts to the Battousai. That fight is as good as anime gets.
        Amen. I should watch that series again. It literally changed my life when I watched it years ago. It made me a more thoughtful and compassionate person.
            My god, I thought I was the only one. Here I was feeling silly for finding deep philosophical lessons in an anime, it’s great to learn I’m not alone. If a broken, bloodthirsty murderer can find peace through struggling to be a better person and transform himself into who he wants to be rather than what circumstance made him, why can’t I?
                Right. I watched it in my teens and it seriously blew my mind. 20 years later I still think back fondly on every moment of that series. Valuable life lessons wrapped up in an incredible story. And yes, the action is absolutely sick, with the specific battle you mentioned above being one of my favorite parts of the whole series.
                    Kenshin finally accepting that his life was worth living and cutting down Hiko was the most inspirational thing my young mind had ever encountered.
                        Yeah... that does it. I need to rewatch this series. And I haven't watched anime in many years now.

Thanks for reigniting the interest.

Another anime I loved to death, though completely different and for different reasons, was Serial Experiments Lain. Talk about a trip. I wonder if I'd understand it now that I'm older...
                            Never saw it, but we seem to have similar taste. I’ll check it out when I have a chance.

Good choice on rewatching RuroKen. When you watch Kenshin vs Jinei, it’ll feel like coming home. Just remember that everything after Shishio is filler, and should be ignored.
                                Yeah, I actually kind of liked the post-Shishio episodes, but nowhere NEAR as much. The OVAs are amazing. I think I'll start by watching those again :)
                                    The OVAs are so, so good. Wise choice.
        I am talking about the topic where if you hesitate you age. This is the baseline for the story in Bleach. And also watch the main story not fillers.
            I’d rather stick my hand in boiling water than watch Bleach filler. The main story drags in a lot of sections, especially when they blow through their animation budget and subsequent episodes suffer, but when Bleach is done right, it’s really fantastic.

Rurouni Kenshin is better, though. Watch it if you haven’t.
                Ill check it out. Thanks. 👍
                    Episode 30 is my favorite episode of anime, period. You’re in for a ride.
                Bleach filler is almost as bad as Naruto filler. Also I'd recommend Samurai Champloo as well.
No, but every time I hear someone say "one" I can't help but think "The parent is absolute"
Is everyone actually playing this game in English? The only reason I even recognize that quote is because Creepling frequently inserts it into his Sekiro lore videos and it’s really funny every time. 

Like,  but seriously though, are ya’ll actually going into settings and manually changing the game to English on purpose? I really just don’t know what’s wrong with this world anymore. Don’t get me wrong, what I’ve heard of the dub so far has been fine, but like, it’s Japan: The Game. How could you *not* play it in Japanese? And it’s even the default setting.
    Uhm? "Hesitation is Defeat" is said in the Japanese VO, as well...
        Yeah, in Japanese. He doesn’t “say” hesitation is defeat. He says whatever the equivalent is in Japanese. So when I heard it in Creepling’s video I didn’t even recognize it. Also doesn’t help that there are obviously different voice actors in both languages, so I also didn’t recognize his voice in general.
            I'm not familiar with the video. So maybe I'm missing context here. I'm just familiar with SSI telling me hesitation is defeat 100 times, granted by the subtitles.
                I dunno, I just didn’t remember the quote because I was hearing the Japanese all the time and I’m much more stimulated by sound than I am by vision.
                    Makes sense. I'm so used to subtitles that my eyes instinctively read it every time so it sunk in.
I use it during normal speech now, yes.
I play a bit of Rocket League, and I'm always saying "Hesitation is defeat" when playing with friends.
Is everyone actually playing this game in English? The only reason I even recognize that quote is because Creepling frequently inserts it into his Sekiro lore videos and it’s really funny every time. 

Like,  but seriously though, are ya’ll actually going into settings and manually changing the game to English on purpose? I really just don’t know what’s wrong with this world anymore. Don’t get me wrong, what I’ve heard of the dub so far has been fine, but like, it’s Japan: The Game. How could you *not* play it in Japanese? And it’s even the default setting.
    >ya’ll actually going into settings and manually changing the game to English

It asks what language you want to at the beginning.

>but like, it’s Japan: The Game. How could you not play it in Japanese?

Because I don't speak Japanese..?
        It’s got subtitles. Hello?

And I don’t remember it ever asking me what language I wanted. It was always just in Japanese but maybe I’m not remembering correctly.

I don’t get when people don’t want to experience something in its original language as far as the voices go. Like in The Last Samurai, would you rather they hired all western born Asian actors who grew up speaking fluent English so that they could do their lines in standard American or British English so you wouldn’t have to read subtitles? Do you see how absurd that would be and how out of place that would be? Just seems like if it’s taking place in the real world, the people should be speaking whatever language those people spoke.
For real, what did people find so hard about this guy? He was easier than Master Murai lmao
It’s honestly brilliant, and says so much about Isshin himself. To defeat the demon of Ashina, you must become an even greater devil yourself. As long as I was scared of Isshin, his second form would absolutely thrash me. I was only able to defeat him when I decided it was he who should fear me, and played as such.
    Yeah that fight for me goes like this:
Genichiro- that was a fight?
Isshin 1st phase- I can do this
2nd- "hesitation is defeat" x10000
3rd- the lighting just makes it so easy
        Genichiro is a headstrong boy playing with powers he doesn’t understand, and is easily dealt with. Isshin’s first form is a test of mastery. If you can properly counter, he isn’t difficult. His second form is a test of courage. You know how to fight, but do you know how to win? His third form is a test of nerves. You’ve proven you can gain the victory, but will your own anxiety betray you? When the moment comes, will you seize it? Will you hesitate?

That fight in particular is absolute poetry. I’m getting excited just thinking about it.
            ugh god damn. my vr headset came in the mail when I got to the ministry invasion at ashina castle. haven't picked it up since. 

but this comment. 


I need to finish the game.
                You do. The last battle is my all time favorite video game boss, and I’ve been playing games for almost thirty years. The entire game has been training you for that one encounter, and it is sublime.
                    Good to know...I just started 2 days ago and I'm getting my ads handed to.

Trying not to be scared of the big stuff.

I'm stuck in 2 places...a general..and some huge sumo  guy.

My favorite parts have been when I can be stealthily and kill things..love the tenchu vibe.
                        The amazing thing about Sekiro is that it’s several games in one. In the beginning, before you have a larger health bar and access to many skills, it’s well played as a stealth-style Tenchu game. As you progress, you’ll find yourself relying on stealth less and less as you hone yourself into a peerless warrior. Sekiro is a harsh master, but it has much to teach if you’re willing to learn.
                            Good to know.

Always something to learn and I'm willing to learn.I died like 50 times or more to that red eyed ogre till I finally got it right.

I need to focus more,practice my timing and be more aggressive and not worry about getting hit because I'm going to get hit.

I just feel like I'm missing something..and I'm not sure what it is.

I'm not as fluid as I should be,I feel clumsy and that frustrates me.
                                You’ll get there. The red eyed ogre is weak to fire, and you’re not explicitly told to follow another path until you get a fire weapon. The game will feel frustrating and impossible, until it doesn’t. At some point during some boss fight, it’ll click. You’ll stop reacting and start flowing. You’ll anticipate and punish mistakes without even realize you’re doing it. Once you start viewing deflections as another avenue of attack, you’re well on your way. And never forget...

Hesitation is defeat.
                    Couldn't agree more with this. I just beat him today and I feel amazing!!!
                        You didn’t hesitate.
                    This
                Do it, Sekiro!
                >ugh god damn. my vr headset came in the mail when I got to the ministry invasion at ashina castle

do you mind me asking which games you're playing? I got a PSVR a while ago and had fun for like a week, now it's just collecting dust. Firewall doesn't let you mute people, Skyrim VR has horrible movement, and the other VR games are kinda short
                    Not OP but blood and truth is badass. Also I’m enjoying wipeout and To the Top.
                        Didn't know WipeOut was on PSVR I played that game nonstop on my PSP back in the day. I'll also check out the other two, thanks! I have sunshine Arizona which was alright and Archangel really missed the mark for me. I really want BeatSaber but I'll have to wait till the MonsterCat bundle goes on sale
                            Also it goes without saying but Astrobot is a ton of fun. Moss is a good substitute as well. 

Have fun!
                    ah wish I could help you. I'm on pc. I know the psvr market is pretty hurting game wise. Superhot VR is probably one of my faves that are on there. it's really fun. the throwing mechanic is sorta spotty due to poor tracking but it's still a solid experience and loads of fun. Beatsaber I've heard is a blast too. Same with that Creed boxing game. My buddy has a psvr and has the same complaints as you but he enjoys those three the most. I'm sure you've already tried them though and they fall under the "kinda short" part of your reply. 


but as for pc I play Pavlov VR (literally counterstrike VR), Minecraft VR, Sairento VR and Blade and Sorcery. If any of those come out on PSVR scoop them up asap. 

those have been my top 4 lately. 

it's a shame vanilla skyrim vr is so shit. it's pretty dece with mods but without them it's just a nightmare. 


psvr I feel is doing more damage to the VR scene than good. Sure it's allowing access to lower price ranges but it seems to be putting out a "VR is DOA" message to people. The psvr got stale after a couple weeks for me and my friend that I was staying with a few months ago, yet I've been playing my vive for probably 2 months straight now since I've gotten it. 


If you're really into VR I cannot reccomend the vive enough. As far as looks go sure there's better headsets out there currently. but the tracking is phenomenal. no worrying about facing your psvr camera all the time, no tracking black outs. it's a phenomenal step up from the psvr imo plus it has the games to back it up. 


this is how I justified spending the money:

1 year ago I built a gaming pc. made sure components would be up to par for vr in the future. went with an AMD build to save money vs Intel. it helped I was heavily addicted to rocket league at the time and the performance upgrade compared to ps4 brought me up a solid 2 divisions. 

then the following year I decided to say fuck it and ordered the headset on sale for 600 bucks CAD. I was stressing out big time about spending the cash until it came. once I played it tho all my regrets went out the window and I can honestly say it was an amazing purchase. 


anyway this reply got WAY out of hand hahaha take er easy kind gold stranger
                        I'm really looking into getting an oculus quest since it's so portable
            >His third form is a test of nerves.

"C'mon Isshin, GIMME THAT LIGHTNING!!"
                "BITCH, I AM THUNDER!"
            Fucking, THIS, dude! It's so true.
            Gonna copy this because it's beautiful
        This is literally how the boss fight went for me. The second phase is the whole boss fight. The first phase was also honestly quite intense as you had to be constantly up his ass to deal any posture damage. The second phase was brutal. You can't get too close to him because he just knocks you out with his spear, or be too far because he whips out his gun and takes out a massive chunk of your health which you can't heal back as Isshin just will not let you. The third phase is comparable to Genichiro, I did not take a hit. The first and second phase have to be played with precision, and one small mistake and you're pretty much screwed unfortunately.
    Same thing he made me quit the game for 3 weeks. But then I came back and said, "This is just another boss, I've been through a lot worse than a dude with a sword and a spear" and just started pummeling him nonstop (of course he killed me 18 more times).
Specialy satisfiying when you decide not to fear the lighning attacks and just throw them back at him!!! SO GOOD
    this is an absolutely brilliant way to put this.
I really like this explanation because it fits the spirit of the game perfectly. Focusing on the fight should be your number one priority, because in reality you shouldn’t need to use your healing items of upgrades. A truly skilled shinobi could come out of a fight unharmed by their enemy.
    I think that's the intention.


Lore wise i think Wolf only dies twice.

Once in the hirata Estate memory

Again when he first drew the Mortal Blade.

If that's true then Wolf may never have need to use healing items that much
        Found my inspiration for a new speedrun type! “Play the game as canonically intended, without teleporting or dying outside the intended number of times”
            So basically a no death, no teleporting run since both those deaths happen in cutscenes?
            If it’s no teleporting how do you get from the Depths back to Ashura Castle?
                Glitches

Duh
                Knowing the speed running community, I’m sure there’s an exploit that can be found.
                Do the depths last and use the scripted teleport
                    There’s a scripted teleport?
                        wait I confused myself with when the dragon teleports you back to ahina castle
            I think Happy Hob did a no-hit run... not sure if he teleported.
        I believe he also ends up dying after losing his arm. But I’m not 100% sure.
            Na the sculptor brings you back. You were on the brink of death but didnt die there.
The only flaw in that logic is that your low hp also means lower hp gauge, and that actually makes fighting harder and keeping your hp high a priority for most players.
    But as long as you deflect, your posture won't break.
    \*posture
    But again, by focusing purely on the fight, slower posture regen shouldn’t even be an issue; as long as your timing is spot-on and you can deflect perfectly, your posture bar will never break. In the end it all goes back to never hesitating and just diving right into the thick of it.
On the flip side, though, rushing can just as easily lead to defeat! How many times have you seen the boss is on 1mm hp, and throw caution to the wind, only to get killed by an easily avoided attack?
This description is the best to explain it all.

To defeat these "harder" enemies, you literally need to find another state of mind.
We Ultra Instinct now boys.
I took the opposite. Just beat owl after 49 tries with the bell on when it took me two without. I got to the point where I had his attack patterns down and just let him come to me and punished his openings.

I couldn't figure out how to be aggressive but also avoid poison so I just stepped off when it came to that.

Rushing in is a form of hesitation
That's how I won against isshin: realized I had no more healing gourds while starting third phase, just said fuck it, I will just dodge his shock attack (countering it takes a little health) and play everything else perfectly, ended up taking like one hit and beat him.
FR you really just gotta go the fuck in on this man. I got to him and beat him same day because I fully realized that. My friend who told me you have to be aggressive in this game is still stuck on isshin because he worries too much about getting fucked, but the secret is you just have to turn the tables and make it so isshin is "worried" about you and not the other way around.
I was literally just in NG+ facing Orin. The first phase, I went through 10 gourd. The second phase, she killed me and I res'd. I literally furrowed my brow and said "hesitation is defeat" and proceeded to whoop her ass without taking any damage by focusing on her rhythms and breaking down her posture slowly. It was amazing. It really feels like Isshin taught me how to own at this game.
Soooo true when i was fighting owl at hirata my hp was probably 1/3. And insteading of running away i held my ground then i ended up getting his first life marker. Then unaware of his second form i died. But that line should guide you for the game.
That’s how I beat the bridge night actually, and my hp was so low when I pushed him off, a small tap from a child could have killed me.

With the eye contact for increased posture damage.
    Leave them on the ground in a confused pile of pain. Shout out, “Oh how my blood boils!” as you seek out your next foe.

I’ll hold you to that.
Hesitation is defeat, but recklessness? You’ve lost before you’ve begun.

    My apologies, I spelled it wrong :/
    Hey, just a question since you look like you know the Japanese line, do you know what the Kanji for the phrase is? It might be an interesting illustration idea. Thanks!
        I don't know Japanese myself but according to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sekiro/comments/bbeo2h/hesitation_is_defeat/) it'd be written out as:

迷えば敗れる
            Thanks man!
Unagi usagi onigiri
    Is that the language or the symbols?
        Hai.
Umm what?
    That's the japanese line
    Japanese voice sounds like this, I guess
Crown of sorrow?
    Last wish a clan mate panicked during the vault and missed his slam because he thought the ad was going to push him but ad died and he still missed the cleanse. So you know hesitation is defeat. Lol
    Crown of Sorrow is 3 years old?!?!?
the mortal foot.
I’d take SSI over granddaddy Isshin any day!
You can break out of your shell, friend. I believe in you. The fact that you’re trying is enough; through effort and pain, you will stand victorious.
You hesitated.
Nobody you know is good enough to have reached Isshin. Hesitaters, every one of them.
    More like people i know don't play games :'(
        I know that feel, and I hate it. Their loss. They’ll never know the pure, sublime joy of banging your head against a boss, slowly getting better, winning, and coming out the other side as more than you were.
Be bold. Be fierce. Be relentless. A wolf can eat a demon if it’s hungry enough.
It’s a good way to look at life. Don’t rush in recklessly, but take opportunities without holding yourself back. Hesitation is defeat.
I mean, it's true enough to be. If you try, the worst they say is "no," but hesitation? Immediate defeat.
>Reply

LOL, that's great!
I’ve watched plenty of Bleach. Certain fights and certain storylines are wonderful, but many are really bad. Rurouni Kenshin is the true Sekiro anime.
    Amen! Also, Samurai Champloo is a good rurouni anime. Watched it because i got back into japanese lore cause of Sekiro and when i found out it was created by the guy who made Cowboy Bepop , i didn't hesitate to watch it.
        I can’t decide which is more Sekiro, Saito vs Kenshin or Kariya vs Jin. Actually, scratch that. Kenshin stops hesitating as he reverts to the Battousai. That fight is as good as anime gets.
    Amen. I should watch that series again. It literally changed my life when I watched it years ago. It made me a more thoughtful and compassionate person.
        My god, I thought I was the only one. Here I was feeling silly for finding deep philosophical lessons in an anime, it’s great to learn I’m not alone. If a broken, bloodthirsty murderer can find peace through struggling to be a better person and transform himself into who he wants to be rather than what circumstance made him, why can’t I?
            Right. I watched it in my teens and it seriously blew my mind. 20 years later I still think back fondly on every moment of that series. Valuable life lessons wrapped up in an incredible story. And yes, the action is absolutely sick, with the specific battle you mentioned above being one of my favorite parts of the whole series.
                Kenshin finally accepting that his life was worth living and cutting down Hiko was the most inspirational thing my young mind had ever encountered.
                    Yeah... that does it. I need to rewatch this series. And I haven't watched anime in many years now.

Thanks for reigniting the interest.

Another anime I loved to death, though completely different and for different reasons, was Serial Experiments Lain. Talk about a trip. I wonder if I'd understand it now that I'm older...
                        Never saw it, but we seem to have similar taste. I’ll check it out when I have a chance.

Good choice on rewatching RuroKen. When you watch Kenshin vs Jinei, it’ll feel like coming home. Just remember that everything after Shishio is filler, and should be ignored.
                            Yeah, I actually kind of liked the post-Shishio episodes, but nowhere NEAR as much. The OVAs are amazing. I think I'll start by watching those again :)
                                The OVAs are so, so good. Wise choice.
    I am talking about the topic where if you hesitate you age. This is the baseline for the story in Bleach. And also watch the main story not fillers.
        I’d rather stick my hand in boiling water than watch Bleach filler. The main story drags in a lot of sections, especially when they blow through their animation budget and subsequent episodes suffer, but when Bleach is done right, it’s really fantastic.

Rurouni Kenshin is better, though. Watch it if you haven’t.
            Ill check it out. Thanks. 👍
                Episode 30 is my favorite episode of anime, period. You’re in for a ride.
            Bleach filler is almost as bad as Naruto filler. Also I'd recommend Samurai Champloo as well.
Uhm? "Hesitation is Defeat" is said in the Japanese VO, as well...

this is how I justified spending the money:

1 year ago I built a gaming pc. made sure components would be up to par for vr in the future. went with an AMD build to save money vs Intel. it helped I was heavily addicted to rocket league at the time and the performance upgrade compared to ps4 brought me up a solid 2 divisions. 

then the following year I decided to say fuck it and ordered the headset on sale for 600 bucks CAD. I was stressing out big time about spending the cash until it came. once I played it tho all my regrets went out the window and I can honestly say it was an amazing purchase. 


anyway this reply got WAY out of hand hahaha take er easy kind gold stranger
                    I'm really looking into getting an oculus quest since it's so portable
        >His third form is a test of nerves.

"C'mon Isshin, GIMME THAT LIGHTNING!!"
            "BITCH, I AM THUNDER!"
        Fucking, THIS, dude! It's so true.
        Gonna copy this because it's beautiful
    This is literally how the boss fight went for me. The second phase is the whole boss fight. The first phase was also honestly quite intense as you had to be constantly up his ass to deal any posture damage. The second phase was brutal. You can't get too close to him because he just knocks you out with his spear, or be too far because he whips out his gun and takes out a massive chunk of your health which you can't heal back as Isshin just will not let you. The third phase is comparable to Genichiro, I did not take a hit. The first and second phase have to be played with precision, and one small mistake and you're pretty much screwed unfortunately.
Same thing he made me quit the game for 3 weeks. But then I came back and said, "This is just another boss, I've been through a lot worse than a dude with a sword and a spear" and just started pummeling him nonstop (of course he killed me 18 more times).
Specialy satisfiying when you decide not to fear the lighning attacks and just throw them back at him!!! SO GOOD
this is an absolutely brilliant way to put this.
I think that's the intention.


Lore wise i think Wolf only dies twice.

Once in the hirata Estate memory

Again when he first drew the Mortal Blade.

If that's true then Wolf may never have need to use healing items that much
    Found my inspiration for a new speedrun type! “Play the game as canonically intended, without teleporting or dying outside the intended number of times”
        So basically a no death, no teleporting run since both those deaths happen in cutscenes?
        If it’s no teleporting how do you get from the Depths back to Ashura Castle?
            Glitches

Duh
            Knowing the speed running community, I’m sure there’s an exploit that can be found.
            Do the depths last and use the scripted teleport
                There’s a scripted teleport?
                    wait I confused myself with when the dragon teleports you back to ahina castle
        I think Happy Hob did a no-hit run... not sure if he teleported.
    I believe he also ends up dying after losing his arm. But I’m not 100% sure.
        Na the sculptor brings you back. You were on the brink of death but didnt die there.
But as long as you deflect, your posture won't break.
\*posture
But again, by focusing purely on the fight, slower posture regen shouldn’t even be an issue; as long as your timing is spot-on and you can deflect perfectly, your posture bar will never break. In the end it all goes back to never hesitating and just diving right into the thick of it.

        Mikiri counter handshake! 

Or more specifically speaking- that’s Trump’s signature handshake, asserting himself unto his victim.

As if using the mikiri against the Lone Shadows' thrust kick wasn't hilarious enough, lol
Leave them on the ground in a confused pile of pain. Shout out, “Oh how my blood boils!” as you seek out your next foe.
Nothing ever happens
My apologies, I spelled it wrong :/
Hey, just a question since you look like you know the Japanese line, do you know what the Kanji for the phrase is? It might be an interesting illustration idea. Thanks!
    I don't know Japanese myself but according to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sekiro/comments/bbeo2h/hesitation_is_defeat/) it'd be written out as:

迷えば敗れる
        Thanks man!
Is that the language or the symbols?
    Hai.
That's the japanese line
Japanese voice sounds like this, I guess
Last wish a clan mate panicked during the vault and missed his slam because he thought the ad was going to push him but ad died and he still missed the cleanse. So you know hesitation is defeat. Lol
Crown of Sorrow is 3 years old?!?!?
More like people i know don't play games :'(
    I know that feel, and I hate it. Their loss. They’ll never know the pure, sublime joy of banging your head against a boss, slowly getting better, winning, and coming out the other side as more than you were.
Amen! Also, Samurai Champloo is a good rurouni anime. Watched it because i got back into japanese lore cause of Sekiro and when i found out it was created by the guy who made Cowboy Bepop , i didn't hesitate to watch it.
    I can’t decide which is more Sekiro, Saito vs Kenshin or Kariya vs Jin. Actually, scratch that. Kenshin stops hesitating as he reverts to the Battousai. That fight is as good as anime gets.
Amen. I should watch that series again. It literally changed my life when I watched it years ago. It made me a more thoughtful and compassionate person.
    My god, I thought I was the only one. Here I was feeling silly for finding deep philosophical lessons in an anime, it’s great to learn I’m not alone. If a broken, bloodthirsty murderer can find peace through struggling to be a better person and transform himself into who he wants to be rather than what circumstance made him, why can’t I?
        Right. I watched it in my teens and it seriously blew my mind. 20 years later I still think back fondly on every moment of that series. Valuable life lessons wrapped up in an incredible story. And yes, the action is absolutely sick, with the specific battle you mentioned above being one of my favorite parts of the whole series.
            Kenshin finally accepting that his life was worth living and cutting down Hiko was the most inspirational thing my young mind had ever encountered.
                Yeah... that does it. I need to rewatch this series. And I haven't watched anime in many years now.

Thanks for reigniting the interest.

Another anime I loved to death, though completely different and for different reasons, was Serial Experiments Lain. Talk about a trip. I wonder if I'd understand it now that I'm older...
                    Never saw it, but we seem to have similar taste. I’ll check it out when I have a chance.

Good choice on rewatching RuroKen. When you watch Kenshin vs Jinei, it’ll feel like coming home. Just remember that everything after Shishio is filler, and should be ignored.
                        Yeah, I actually kind of liked the post-Shishio episodes, but nowhere NEAR as much. The OVAs are amazing. I think I'll start by watching those again :)
                            The OVAs are so, so good. Wise choice.
I am talking about the topic where if you hesitate you age. This is the baseline for the story in Bleach. And also watch the main story not fillers.
    I’d rather stick my hand in boiling water than watch Bleach filler. The main story drags in a lot of sections, especially when they blow through their animation budget and subsequent episodes suffer, but when Bleach is done right, it’s really fantastic.

Rurouni Kenshin is better, though. Watch it if you haven’t.
        Ill check it out. Thanks. 👍
            Episode 30 is my favorite episode of anime, period. You’re in for a ride.
        Bleach filler is almost as bad as Naruto filler. Also I'd recommend Samurai Champloo as well.
Yeah, in Japanese. He doesn’t “say” hesitation is defeat. He says whatever the equivalent is in Japanese. So when I heard it in Creepling’s video I didn’t even recognize it. Also doesn’t help that there are obviously different voice actors in both languages, so I also didn’t recognize his voice in general.
    I'm not familiar with the video. So maybe I'm missing context here. I'm just familiar with SSI telling me hesitation is defeat 100 times, granted by the subtitles.
        I dunno, I just didn’t remember the quote because I was hearing the Japanese all the time and I’m much more stimulated by sound than I am by vision.
            Makes sense. I'm so used to subtitles that my eyes instinctively read it every time so it sunk in.
It’s got subtitles. Hello?

And I don’t remember it ever asking me what language I wanted. It was always just in Japanese but maybe I’m not remembering correctly.

I don’t get when people don’t want to experience something in its original language as far as the voices go. Like in The Last Samurai, would you rather they hired all western born Asian actors who grew up speaking fluent English so that they could do their lines in standard American or British English so you wouldn’t have to read subtitles? Do you see how absurd that would be and how out of place that would be? Just seems like if it’s taking place in the real world, the people should be speaking whatever language those people spoke.
Genichiro is a headstrong boy playing with powers he doesn’t understand, and is easily dealt with. Isshin’s first form is a test of mastery. If you can properly counter, he isn’t difficult. His second form is a test of courage. You know how to fight, but do you know how to win? His third form is a test of nerves. You’ve proven you can gain the victory, but will your own anxiety betray you? When the moment comes, will you seize it? Will you hesitate?

That fight in particular is absolute poetry. I’m getting excited just thinking about it.
    ugh god damn. my vr headset came in the mail when I got to the ministry invasion at ashina castle. haven't picked it up since. 

but this comment. 


I need to finish the game.
        You do. The last battle is my all time favorite video game boss, and I’ve been playing games for almost thirty years. The entire game has been training you for that one encounter, and it is sublime.
            Good to know...I just started 2 days ago and I'm getting my ads handed to.

Trying not to be scared of the big stuff.

I'm stuck in 2 places...a general..and some huge sumo  guy.

My favorite parts have been when I can be stealthily and kill things..love the tenchu vibe.
                The amazing thing about Sekiro is that it’s several games in one. In the beginning, before you have a larger health bar and access to many skills, it’s well played as a stealth-style Tenchu game. As you progress, you’ll find yourself relying on stealth less and less as you hone yourself into a peerless warrior. Sekiro is a harsh master, but it has much to teach if you’re willing to learn.
                    Good to know.

Always something to learn and I'm willing to learn.I died like 50 times or more to that red eyed ogre till I finally got it right.

I need to focus more,practice my timing and be more aggressive and not worry about getting hit because I'm going to get hit.

I just feel like I'm missing something..and I'm not sure what it is.

I'm not as fluid as I should be,I feel clumsy and that frustrates me.
                        You’ll get there. The red eyed ogre is weak to fire, and you’re not explicitly told to follow another path until you get a fire weapon. The game will feel frustrating and impossible, until it doesn’t. At some point during some boss fight, it’ll click. You’ll stop reacting and start flowing. You’ll anticipate and punish mistakes without even realize you’re doing it. Once you start viewing deflections as another avenue of attack, you’re well on your way. And never forget...

Hesitation is defeat.
            Couldn't agree more with this. I just beat him today and I feel amazing!!!
                You didn’t hesitate.
            This
        Do it, Sekiro!
        >ugh god damn. my vr headset came in the mail when I got to the ministry invasion at ashina castle

do you mind me asking which games you're playing? I got a PSVR a while ago and had fun for like a week, now it's just collecting dust. Firewall doesn't let you mute people, Skyrim VR has horrible movement, and the other VR games are kinda short
            Not OP but blood and truth is badass. Also I’m enjoying wipeout and To the Top.
                Didn't know WipeOut was on PSVR I played that game nonstop on my PSP back in the day. I'll also check out the other two, thanks! I have sunshine Arizona which was alright and Archangel really missed the mark for me. I really want BeatSaber but I'll have to wait till the MonsterCat bundle goes on sale
                    Also it goes without saying but Astrobot is a ton of fun. Moss is a good substitute as well. 

Have fun!
            ah wish I could help you. I'm on pc. I know the psvr market is pretty hurting game wise. Superhot VR is probably one of my faves that are on there. it's really fun. the throwing mechanic is sorta spotty due to poor tracking but it's still a solid experience and loads of fun. Beatsaber I've heard is a blast too. Same with that Creed boxing game. My buddy has a psvr and has the same complaints as you but he enjoys those three the most. I'm sure you've already tried them though and they fall under the "kinda short" part of your reply. 


but as for pc I play Pavlov VR (literally counterstrike VR), Minecraft VR, Sairento VR and Blade and Sorcery. If any of those come out on PSVR scoop them up asap. 

those have been my top 4 lately. 

it's a shame vanilla skyrim vr is so shit. it's pretty dece with mods but without them it's just a nightmare. 


psvr I feel is doing more damage to the VR scene than good. Sure it's allowing access to lower price ranges but it seems to be putting out a "VR is DOA" message to people. The psvr got stale after a couple weeks for me and my friend that I was staying with a few months ago, yet I've been playing my vive for probably 2 months straight now since I've gotten it. 


If you're really into VR I cannot reccomend the vive enough. As far as looks go sure there's better headsets out there currently. but the tracking is phenomenal. no worrying about facing your psvr camera all the time, no tracking black outs. it's a phenomenal step up from the psvr imo plus it has the games to back it up. 


this is how I justified spending the money:

1 year ago I built a gaming pc. made sure components would be up to par for vr in the future. went with an AMD build to save money vs Intel. it helped I was heavily addicted to rocket league at the time and the performance upgrade compared to ps4 brought me up a solid 2 divisions. 

then the following year I decided to say fuck it and ordered the headset on sale for 600 bucks CAD. I was stressing out big time about spending the cash until it came. once I played it tho all my regrets went out the window and I can honestly say it was an amazing purchase.

[Here’s a video of the president of Portugal beating him to the punch](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&source=web&cd=&ved=0ahUKEwiJl-O96t_iAhWRmlkKHdHMBo8QzPwBCAM&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fworld%2Famericas%2Ftrump-handshake-portugal-president-rebelo-de-sousa-white-house-a8422741.html&psig=AOvVaw225qQyO6KagXIwy0zo0h9u&ust=1560287624239744)
    Jesus politicians are childish.
Thanks man!
Right. I watched it in my teens and it seriously blew my mind. 20 years later I still think back fondly on every moment of that series. Valuable life lessons wrapped up in an incredible story. And yes, the action is absolutely sick, with the specific battle you mentioned above being one of my favorite parts of the whole series.
    Kenshin finally accepting that his life was worth living and cutting down Hiko was the most inspirational thing my young mind had ever encountered.
        Yeah... that does it. I need to rewatch this series. And I haven't watched anime in many years now.

Thanks for reigniting the interest.

Another anime I loved to death, though completely different and for different reasons, was Serial Experiments Lain. Talk about a trip. I wonder if I'd understand it now that I'm older...
            Never saw it, but we seem to have similar taste. I’ll check it out when I have a chance.

Good choice on rewatching RuroKen. When you watch Kenshin vs Jinei, it’ll feel like coming home. Just remember that everything after Shishio is filler, and should be ignored.
                Yeah, I actually kind of liked the post-Shishio episodes, but nowhere NEAR as much. The OVAs are amazing. I think I'll start by watching those again :)
                    The OVAs are so, so good. Wise choice.
Ill check it out. Thanks. 👍
    Episode 30 is my favorite episode of anime, period. You’re in for a ride.
Bleach filler is almost as bad as Naruto filler. Also I'd recommend Samurai Champloo as well.
I dunno, I just didn’t remember the quote because I was hearing the Japanese all the time and I’m much more stimulated by sound than I am by vision.
    Makes sense. I'm so used to subtitles that my eyes instinctively read it every time so it sunk in.
You do. The last battle is my all time favorite video game boss, and I’ve been playing games for almost thirty years. The entire game has been training you for that one encounter, and it is sublime.
    Good to know...I just started 2 days ago and I'm getting my ads handed to.

Trying not to be scared of the big stuff.

I'm stuck in 2 places...a general..and some huge sumo  guy.

My favorite parts have been when I can be stealthily and kill things..love the tenchu vibe.
        The amazing thing about Sekiro is that it’s several games in one. In the beginning, before you have a larger health bar and access to many skills, it’s well played as a stealth-style Tenchu game. As you progress, you’ll find yourself relying on stealth less and less as you hone yourself into a peerless warrior. Sekiro is a harsh master, but it has much to teach if you’re willing to learn.
            Good to know.

Always something to learn and I'm willing to learn.I died like 50 times or more to that red eyed ogre till I finally got it right.

I need to focus more,practice my timing and be more aggressive and not worry about getting hit because I'm going to get hit.

I just feel like I'm missing something..and I'm not sure what it is.

I'm not as fluid as I should be,I feel clumsy and that frustrates me.
                You’ll get there. The red eyed ogre is weak to fire, and you’re not explicitly told to follow another path until you get a fire weapon. The game will feel frustrating and impossible, until it doesn’t. At some point during some boss fight, it’ll click. You’ll stop reacting and start flowing. You’ll anticipate and punish mistakes without even realize you’re doing it. Once you start viewing deflections as another avenue of attack, you’re well on your way. And never forget...

Hesitation is defeat.
    Couldn't agree more with this. I just beat him today and I feel amazing!!!
        You didn’t hesitate.
    This
Do it, Sekiro!
>ugh god damn. my vr headset came in the mail when I got to the ministry invasion at ashina castle

do you mind me asking which games you're playing? I got a PSVR a while ago and had fun for like a week, now it's just collecting dust. Firewall doesn't let you mute people, Skyrim VR has horrible movement, and the other VR games are kinda short
    Not OP but blood and truth is badass. Also I’m enjoying wipeout and To the Top.
        Didn't know WipeOut was on PSVR I played that game nonstop on my PSP back in the day. I'll also check out the other two, thanks! I have sunshine Arizona which was alright and Archangel really missed the mark for me. I really want BeatSaber but I'll have to wait till the MonsterCat bundle goes on sale
            Also it goes without saying but Astrobot is a ton of fun. Moss is a good substitute as well. 

Have fun!
    ah wish I could help you. I'm on pc. I know the psvr market is pretty hurting game wise. Superhot VR is probably one of my faves that are on there. it's really fun. the throwing mechanic is sorta spotty due to poor tracking but it's still a solid experience and loads of fun. Beatsaber I've heard is a blast too. Same with that Creed boxing game. My buddy has a psvr and has the same complaints as you but he enjoys those three the most. I'm sure you've already tried them though and they fall under the "kinda short" part of your reply. 


but as for pc I play Pavlov VR (literally counterstrike VR), Minecraft VR, Sairento VR and Blade and Sorcery. If any of those come out on PSVR scoop them up asap. 

those have been my top 4 lately. 

it's a shame vanilla skyrim vr is so shit. it's pretty dece with mods but without them it's just a nightmare. 


psvr I feel is doing more damage to the VR scene than good. Sure it's allowing access to lower price ranges but it seems to be putting out a "VR is DOA" message to people. The psvr got stale after a couple weeks for me and my friend that I was staying with a few months ago, yet I've been playing my vive for probably 2 months straight now since I've gotten it. 


If you're really into VR I cannot reccomend the vive enough. As far as looks go sure there's better headsets out there currently. but the tracking is phenomenal. no worrying about facing your psvr camera all the time, no tracking black outs. it's a phenomenal step up from the psvr imo plus it has the games to back it up. 


this is how I justified spending the money:

1 year ago I built a gaming pc. made sure components would be up to par for vr in the future. went with an AMD build to save money vs Intel. it helped I was heavily addicted to rocket league at the time and the performance upgrade compared to ps4 brought me up a solid 2 divisions. 

then the following year I decided to say fuck it and ordered the headset on sale for 600 bucks CAD. I was stressing out big time about spending the cash until it came. once I played it tho all my regrets went out the window and I can honestly say it was an amazing purchase. 


anyway this reply got WAY out of hand hahaha take er easy kind gold stranger
        I'm really looking into getting an oculus quest since it's so portable
"BITCH, I AM THUNDER!"
Glitches

Duh
Knowing the speed running community, I’m sure there’s an exploit that can be found.
Do the depths last and use the scripted teleport
    There’s a scripted teleport?
        wait I confused myself with when the dragon teleports you back to ahina castle
