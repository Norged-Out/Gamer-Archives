[[Guy shushed me in the 92nd min then this happened...]]





Fifa 15
People used to score long rage goals 
Now it’s so rare
    10 or 11 was ridiculously easy to score long range goals on.

EDIT: Like, so easy that straight up shooting from the circle at kickoff was a legitimate strategy lol.
        I had it on the wii, I was at the half way mark with iniesta at the far side of the pitch and shook my controller. Top bins
            Ah man fifa 09 on the wii with the big head mode is taking me back
                Yesss!!
                Holy shit haha. Back when in career mode Anderson becomes a 99 rated god
        It was fifa 11
        My friend once got a high ball from a weird angle and decided to shoot using neymar, it was that or let it get out of play. It was near the halfway line so I just pressed start to make my changes, not thinking anything would happen. We had a rule when playing 1vs1 that you only pause when the ball is out of play. My friend did not object this pause, but he said I bet it's gonna be a goal, and that made what happend so much worse because I laughed and took the bet. Equivalent of $5 or something. 
Since then I've hated Neymar. And still to this day I hate it when I face him. 

Game: fifa 10
Teams: Real Madrid - Barcelona
Final score: 0-1
            Neymar was still a Santos player in fifa 10 ..
                We did some edits for teams we wanted.
        Think it was fifa 12? I remember winning division one title in stoppage time from a free kick from about 50 yards out. You could normally score 1 in 10 or so.
            50 yards is 45.72 meters
        My cousins made me and my brother agree to never use Ronaldo off kick off. Even in FIFA 08at Man Utd he could score from the Center circle
            Omg I've been playing FIFA 08 on PS2 with my roommates and I swear to God that is the hardest FIFA I've ever played.
                Dude that FIFA caused me pain
        The number of goals I scored with Dani Alves from like midfield is disgusting
        You should try fifa 07 & pick Lampard… fifa 10 was refreshing in comparison
    Fifa 14 Hernanes from the halfway line all day
        fifa 14 curling car post finesse from either side 40 yards out
    Ye id normally rarely even score outside the box
        Shit always gets blocked
            I tried this pretty often just for the lulz, half the time the player taking kickoff would block the shot.. :\\
    Dont forget those timed finesses from 40 yards out in FIFA 19.
        every time i think i maybe miss something about 19 i’m reminded of one of its hundreds of tragic failures
        I hated that more than anything.
Fifa 19 first timed finesse shots were so annoying
Cuz it was like
Even if you played good and the opponent gets one ok angle to take the first time finesse, you’re gone
It’s going in 100 %. It was annoying cuz even if you dominate the game whole time
The other player can just abuse this.
And let’s not forget el tornado crosses 
Spamming croquetas and infinite elasticos. Hated rhag shit.
            Its a double edged sword basically. I agree it was so frustrating. But I too exploited that and beat better opponents on different occasions.
                “The better player deserves the win”
This is why fifa sucks
Even rn
The network decides who’s the more skilled opponent
        Those were magical
    Second that. Fifa 15 was gold!
        Happy cake day
    People keep saying this, but I feel like I score at least one goal from outside the box per game or every other game at the least. Most of them are with 84 Promes, so it’s not like I’m using Cruyff or Eusebio. I usually just hit LT + RB + B and it’s no problem. Honestly I feel like it’s down to people’s connections, because I am by no stretch of the imagination an elite player.
        He’s talking about deeep goals. Like hitting it from half circle.
            I mean obviously I don’t score those pretty much at all, but I do still hit 25 and 30 yarders fairly frequently.
                Yeah, but those are nothing compared to how ridiculous some of the older fifas were. I still have videos of hitting 50 and 60 yarders against my buddies in fifa 14.
                    That’s when fifa ultimate team was actually fun. You were playing with trading cards with ridiculous stats and ridiculous stuff would happen. 

Now those silver gods are trash compared to the god squads. I actually enjoyed playing more on the switch this year cause you actually play all gold teams and can score bangers.
                    Yeah that’s what
I used to score from weird angles
From like 50 60 yards out.
It was so funny. This year I scored only
One in rivals
Cuz the gk came out for taking the goal kick
The guy probably didn’t realize
So I took advantage of that.
        why LT?
            Well, I started out doing it in squad battles in around I think October or November when there was the CSL icon swaps objective. I was using Teixeira who is one of those players that’s supposed to play higher than their rating, but I just couldn’t score with him no matter what. There was a shot where I was about to get bodied of the ball, so I did an LT + finesse, and it just shot right in. I started testing it with different players like my Promes and Koeman, and I at least think it adds a noticeable amount more curve to them. It also helps reduce some nearby players from blocking, because instead of being able to tackle they are fighting over the ball. It also definitely feels like it adds more power to regular shots, and when I’m through on goal from the top of the box after a one-two with Bazoer that’s the kind of shot I’ll use.
                i think the player shoots with more power as the player is in a standing position when you hold LT to protect the ball, but if it was an OP technique, people would have talked about it more often but i don't think it's a thing idk i might be wrong
                    Honestly it might just be placebo,but it works for me so there’s no point in changing.
        Which position is the LT? cause I wanna know the PS4 equivalent for that
            L2
    Long shots were good every year except this year
        im pretty tricky from the edges of the box
    Scored a bicycle kick from like 30 yards fifa 15
        30 yards is 27.43 meters
    TOTY Kroos was the god of long shots
    Fifa 15 santi cazorla (and 17 for that matter) would bang long shots like finesse in 19 lol
    Good, that shit needed to go
If you could bottle up this feeling and sell it on the market, I’d buy at least 5 shares in your company.
    I don’t think I was ever as hyped from a goal, or even a pack
    Simple Rick’s
        There was a guy who scored a last minute goal from the kickoff in his own half right after his opponent scored seconds before.

And the chemical it makes his brain secrete goes into every Simple Rick's Simple Wafer's Wafer Cookie. Come home to the impossible flavor of your own completion. Come home to Simple Rick's.
You already know this kid just broke everything
    I really hope so
        You are just as toxic as this kid dude, if not much more
        C'mon I understand that sushing is annoying but you are being way more toxic rn imo.
            Issa joke chill
    If it was me on the other end I wouldn't be mad, i'd just be impressed...
Fap worthy
    Not my least proud anyway..
    Nice
        Nice
            Nice

                Nice
You've started the video at a very weird time. Did he actually shush or did you score this, shush him and realise you wanna post it?

                YOU WON'T BELIEVE THESE FIFA Myths
                    Today's  a very special day
    If you press home and then x on xbox, it only saves the last 30 seconds. He wasn't recording the whole game, he just quickly saved his goal. Of course that doesn't prove anything, but it's a perfectly reasonable explanation as to why the opponets shush wasn't included.
        You can actually program your xbox to record longer clips, I believe up to a minute. Mine is currently set at 45 seconds.
            I actually didn't know that, gonna have to check it out, thanks!
            It's way longer. Think it's max 5 minutes. I've got mine at 2 1/2 minutes.
                *10 mins
                     No, no, mine is at 60minutes
                        Oh shit of course there is a dev setting for 24HOURS, SHHHH.
                All depends on the quality. If it’s set to 1080p it only records 2 minutes
            Ye I know about it and will do it next time I post haha, didn’t expect people to care
                Who cares, that was a banger of a goal.
                Idc, I was just adding my 2 cents where it was unnecessary lol
            To further this, if you push the small button above the D-pad (looks like two boxes, not sure the proper name) you can choose to record up to the last 5 minutes of gameplay.
            Really? Ps4 we can record think it up to hour or half hour.
        Thank you, just wanted to post the goal haha didn’t expect people to care this much
            I guess they are on PS or PC, and maybe the way it's cut is just weird if you don't know how recording works on Xbox. For Xbox users it's probably obvious that you used home+x.
            Lol but it’s reddit ... all ppl do here is care so hard it hurts
        Im on xbox i know, he chose a very odd time to record it, its easiest to do as soon as the goal goes in or if you wanna celebrate like this guy surely you wouldn't leave it so late
            I don't know, if I'm trying to get back at my opponent, I celebrate first and record later. Otherwise I just skip and then save.

Same goes for other games as well, when I get a nice kill in CoD, I don't always save immediately, I make sure I have time to do it first. I think he just wanted to make sure he does the revenge celebration, and then pressed save once he knew it's done.
            I got the full goal and my celebration, that’s all I wanted to have
        Wow really? PS4 records the last 15 minutes. Another reason PS4 > Xbox
            I dont care about the consle war but also ps4 can be set to record the last 60 minutes.
    Rumbled!!!
    28 seconds is the typical length of captures on xbox
    Seriously, makes no sense to exclude the original shush...
        Xbox only recorded last 30 seconds, didn’t know it would be cut out
            Then why is the video 29 seconds long?
                Read the other replies
                    I did. If you recorded 30 seconds why is your video 29 seconds? 

I call bullshit.
                        All my Xbox clips range anywhere from 28 seconds to 32 seconds, think what you want but other people have confirmed this
            Gotya, amazing goal bro
            This video is 28 seconds though
                Idno most of my game clips are 28-32 seconds, I’m not too sure why, but anyway the extra two seconds would just be the replay of his goal surely since he didn’t skip
                    I believe you
                    Yeah. I am sure he did shush you. The FIFA community is aids with last minute watching goals knowing you can’t do the same  when u score since it’s game over
                        It's only gotten worse over the course of the year for me, too. So I definitely believe OP. I get shushed in probably 17 out of the 20 champs games I play now. lol
                If you have an xbox you’d know but the video clips are never exactly on time. My minute long records are anywhere from 58 seconds to 1 minute 3 seconds.
    He in all likelihood didn't get shushed and just lied for the karma
    It was a virtual shush
        In a reddit about the virtual players in a game... Mate if you wanna talk about shit like 9/11 or even a random fight in a pub a few months ago it's the wrong sub.
            *shuuuuush*
                You've done me there big man, dont think i come back from you doing that
    He didn't skip the replay either tho.
    Exactly......surely show evidence of the shush or it never happened.  Self defence but with no witness dear boy, I SMELL A MURDER!!!!
This game is fucking stupid.  Take my money.
Looked like he made you watch everything, which makes this even sweeter...
    He did, I wish I recorded face cam for my reaction
        Hopefully he’s a regular in this sub
How?
    Cuz this game is scripted
        Was that with the shot button? because normally that would clear the ball
            Rb and x
                What does Rb (or R2) shot do?
                    RB + shoot is a finesse shot, RB + lob is a lower, more driven aerial pass
                        Oh so it’s not even an actual shot?
                            Exactly
                            No it's a finesse shot (curled for exemple)
                    It would be R1 on PS just a driven cross.
                    It's not a shot, it's a driven lob pass.
        No it isn't. There is not such thing as Scripting you toxic shushing arsehole.
            Lollll calm down Issa game
    Yea. Its from his own half aswell. Normally impossible
This is the karma shushers deserve
    True, so unnecessary considering we skipped all replays until he scored in the 92nd
    Is shushing really riling up people so hard? Because it does rile me up not gonna to lie
        Eh not as much as it used to. Some guy is just after shushing me for 4 goals just there and had no reaction to it. Just dont care anymore
            The Shushing that used to be in Fifa 13 ~14 before they changed it in the recent years, i dont know the exact year when they changed was even worse. That animation pissed me off way too much than the recent one.
                I believe they changed it in fifa 18
            Tbh I don’t mind it, just this time when we were skipping every replay and in the 90th min he does it
        the face celebration riles me up much much more
        if I'm skipping and not taunting, yeah, it pisses me off
We love a baby Dinho 🔥🤙🏾
    He’s so good, got him in icon swaps
    I’ve got the mid and now kinda want the baby for that ponytail hahahah
Love it
Jesus Christ. That was cold as ice
How the hell did that last one go in? I still remember when I scored my only goal from the half line to date back on FIFA 09 and I have wanted to do it again ever since
    Fifa gods helping me
        That was your luck for the next 5 editions or something lol
            For that moment.. I’ll take it
Can’t believe that shot. What a beauty.
Wow how Tf
This is the level of shithousery I aspire to reach, glorious. Instant karma for him lmao
How did you manage that? Was it just a normal shot?
    Rb and x
        Just to be clear, is X shoot or cross?
            Cross
                Thought so. Thanks!
        Rb is bottom right bumper? The pace or the finesse button?
            Finesse, or r1 on ps
                Ah thank you. Great goal btw!
                    Thanks :)
How did you score that
    Fifa gods on my side for once
        One of the great goals
You love to see it
English commentators sound very calmed...
    If only I had spanish commentary on
That was genuinely brilliant I’ve had to watch it about 3-4 times

Do you think Ronaldinho actually shot then? It looks like that was just inside your half so I’m surprised you were even able to attempt one!
    I used Rb and x
You deserve it over playing Messi in Madrid's kit.
    Didn’t even notice haha
WOW that was beautiful!
[deleted]
Karma hurts
FIFA gods restoring justice upon us.
That was sick
Thats my fuckin fantasy rt
The balls on that prick
Dang bangersssss
Square or circle? Hold any other buttons?
    Op said it was Rb and x (R1 and square)
        Thx dude
This game is so fucking stupid
That sound of the post then .." it's level again" is so satisfying and idk why
what did you press? you are my hero! i wanna do that!!
    Rb and x haha, thanks
No way 😂
This goal makes me extremely happy
Rohaldinho’s magic
This game is trash
Possibly my proudest fap
Shushing an equalizer is already suchs an dick move
Seaman cried at shower tonight
    OMG hahahahhaa
Which version of Dinho was that
    89, not sure which that is, from icon swaps 2
Hahahaha unbelievable, best clip I’ve seen for ages
r/bullybackfire
I hate this game lmaooo
I always do this if i concede a goal in 45 or 90th minutes.. still waiting for my 1st goal
My controller would honestly be in a million pieces
Good lord, Ronaldino vs Messi in ultimate teams... I’m curious how much money was spent.
    gold Messi is only 650k on PS4 and 500k on xbox nowadays.

Ronaldinho on the other hand... 🤑🤑🤑
        Icon swaps, I spent €20 on points at the start of the game and that’s it
            That's impressive.
How does he shoot like that? If you just shoot normally from that range, it makes a looping balloon shot?
    almost looks like a driven cross with crossing assistance disabled in the settings menu. I have no idea tho.
        I used Rb and x, dno about that crossing assistance tho
            is X your shot button on XBox?
                Nope B
Nice crossbar challenge
That...Was...Incredible...
✌️✌️😀
I remember being shushed after my opponent equalised in the 90th minute and I was literally fuming, but then I scored a header from a corner in the 92nd minute and shushed him to the halfway line. Best feeling ever, except that my heart was beating like a race horse
How do you do that? I saw some goals like this, but when I try it it's just a weak lob that ends in the goalies hands
    Normally it just goes into the keepers hands aswell, guess it was look
        Yeah that one caused the keeper table
Im so happy you scored that he deserved it so much. Probably broke his monitor and controller
May be the best goal i have seen to date on ‘20
I'm dumb, what's shushing?
    Like the ‘shhhh’ celebration
        But there is no shhh celebration in this video, where is it?
    Hold Right stick to the right
No wonder why fifa considers to remove ronaldinho's card.
Kid is fumingggg!!
long range goal objective complete
I have this kind of exp where my opponent shushes when he just scored 1 goal but I lead by 4 goals. How toxic are fifa players xD
Fifa 09 on the DS shoot from your own half an it always goes in. It used to go between his legs all day long.
    Fifa 09 on the PSP, just shoot from a corner, it goes through the side of the net and it counts as a goal
        What that’s so mad 😂😂
No waaayyy fifa is on your side!
    For once haha
        Go open some packs mate now its the time!!!
That was magic
Glad to know that its possible because I do it nearly all the time and I've hit the crossbar a few times
If any goal is worthy of shushing someone, then it is this. 🤣
jezus nice man xD
The Fifa 15 is real
Hahhaha, nice man. Proper showed him up
You watched the replay right
    Of course, tbh I just wanted to see the goal again
Man i Love you! Thank you. I can stand people who shush
    Love you too x
        I love you both
            I agree with you
Jeez my guy 😂😂
Imagine this goal in the weekend league.
    Thankfully I don’t play weekend league
        That‘s good for your mental health)
I knew what was coming but it was still so satisfying. I've never scored a goal like that despite trying hundreds of times
Oh man the rage the other guy must have had
You shushed him after THAT goal? You're no less toxic
You made it on bleacher report
    Ye haha, they texted me asking for permission
I remember in older FIFA games this was literally the meta kick off strat, or having one player bomb up the middle of the field to head that long ball over the keeper.
How
This is both sickening and glorious.
Goooood ladddddf
Martin Tyler: it’s level again

1 second later 

Martin Tyler: OH WHAT A GOAL
What shushed is mean?
    The ‘ssshhhh’ celebration, basically dickhead move imo
        Got it. Thanks
Dayum!!
Did you use circle or square for that??
    Rb and x (R1 and square I think)
What buttons did you use to make that shot?
    Rb and x
        Ok
i can see only one player toxing celebrating here
Plot twist: he didn‘t actually shush😂
Don’t shush back. It’s good that karma bit him. But don’t return toxicity w more toxicity.
    I normally wouldn’t but I’ll admit I was so shook it went in and it happened
        Nah if someone shushes you, you gotta do it back. The only thing that may stop him is the taste of his own medicine.
            ohhhhhhhh so when other people shush they are toxic arseholes and ruining the game but it is alright for you to

&#x200B;

LMFFAO THIS SUB IS PATHETIC AF
        Whether he shushed or not that goal was so nice you have to shush!
Wow that goal was like Ronaldinho was playing prison football
Lol that is some way to cap off the shush fest dude was like “this is to get one more shush out of you”
    I know well haha, karma is real
To be honest you shouldve dabbed as well
cant say i wouldnt have dabbed
No problem. I was surprised when I figured it out.
And I dont get why ppl shush when they tie the game up. I understand it tho
Lmao that failed dab at the end.
Ay sick! I should’ve but bought mine early on. On the road to a Prime Icon Pack so wishful thinking to get him or R9 loool
Bro.....if I conceded such nonsense....idk....
Beyond dirty
You served him well
Was that a normal shot or did you hold the chip button? That’s one of the best goals I’ve seen on this sub
    I used Rb and x
    Also thank you haha
Deserved win
I'm gonna start trying that.
ONe time i did at the same distance it felt so great 🙂⚽️💙
I don’t care if that guy shushed you while proceeding to run up the field doing cartwheels and backflips, that’s absolute bullshit.
It's almost if the screen shake was in response to you jumping up and down in your house or something.
you get what you fuckin deserve
the commentary ruins everything lmao
Man I feel happy for you but this is also the dumbest shit on the planet
Karma
If he really shushed you I really hope he saw this just for it to rub in lol
I mean, if anything, it highlights how this game just punishes its players. Horrifying. Hilarious, but horrifying.
Oh my god it’s still possible. I used to shoot from every single kick off in previous FIFA’s lol. It used to be very possible to score from halfway line. My mate used to be sooo fucking good at it I hated playing against him because every time I scored he would almost always score a shot from kick off haha. Fifa used to be even more broken than it is now
The amount of times I've tried this I actually thought it was impossible. To see it come off is incredible
That sound off the crossbar is beautiful.
Seems like every player in your team is celebrating in your own half. If this is a real football, the opponent would've pick up the ball from the net, put it on the halfway line, kick off and just shoot for the goal.
lmao wtf!!1 even your keeper came to celebrate lol. ive never seen my keeper come out like that
Funniest thing I've seen in a while
F in the chat for the lad
That's ridiculous
That's when you know you have dda
Just wow. :D gg
never seen goalie come that far to celebrate
That's one hell of a goal even the keeper joined the celebration
I wonder what did the commentaries say?
How can you get the shush to go for long? I try to do it and get it for like 2 seconds. Maybe I’m not supposed to sprint or something idk
I don't really understand why people even sushing in the game or anything equivalent in other games. I just don't get it at all.
This shit was only possible back in 15
The goat
If I conceded this I’d headbutt my PlayStation
LMFAOOO
pfffffffffff :D :D :D :'D I don't know if I should laugh or cry! :D :'S
Well done
I remember scoring a free kick with khedira in fifa 13 from almost my box. Just full power and square
That is some immense bullshit.
I simply see two goals after extra time should have stopped, but thats just a little thing that annoys me.
Was this a lobbed shot, or just a regular one?
and he watched messi walk back
he deserves it for putting that hideous RM shirt on the GOAT
Dream goal
I would throw my ps4 out the window if that happened to me
I only ever scored such a goal with Müller, back in 15. I was so excited I forgot to press save the clip. Shame, since it has been one of my best goals, next to a 30 meter volley screamer with Sessegnon.
Didn't see him shushing. But you did! Why? You should have skipped the celebration and wrote him a message like "And now imagine I would have shushed you..."
He's making Leo wear a Real shirt, that is a sin which he paid for.
LOOOOL What? What did the keeper do?
That was just ronaldinho in the prison cup
That's your get out of jail free card used up
Fifa rigging at its finest
I just hate this game
Imagine sushing in FIFA 20
Oh shit, didn't think this was a thing.
Is that a shot or lobbed pass?
    Rb and x
        So a driven lobbed pass? If you don’t change the default settings.
            Nope never even knew that made a difference tbh
Shush the F out of him you too.
Fucking bs , glad i dont play anymore
Mate this vid got viral on instagram
    Ye your man texted me asking if he can post it haha
        Lol
Pes   ibrah at psg. Dude was a cheat code . Shoot anywhere and u score
Which Ronaldinho is this?
    89 Cam, it’s either baby or mid
 As  a,.《..《《 yrteueuete⅔22
And you shushed him lamp
If he shushed you why'd you cut it off?
    Cba going through this again read the other comments
#Nice
Are you proud? If someone did this to me I would have broken the controller, the PlayStation, my whole house and my life
He’s fucking sick 😂😂😂😂
FIFA 07 Emerson
Scripting-Party +9000
Brfootball put this on their instagram
i would've broken everything. controller, disc, console, wrist you name it
Ksi
I would need a new xbox if this happened to me
Anybody here from Masterbucks?
    Oh wha, am I in his vid?
        Yes
            Just seen there haha, thanks mate
Yes sir
How’s you score behind the halfway line. Doesn’t the player hit it like a clearance behind the line
    Rb and x, I’ve tried it since and couldn’t get it tho
        Oh you’re on Xbox. So I assume you crossed it into the box
Amazing
Who’s on goal? Karius?
So glad I stopped playing this game
bro you are just a toxic fucking arsehole
    Love you too
Where is the shush ? I feel like i'm the only one that doesn't see it. All Messi did was point to the sky which isn't a shush
    Bruh this was so long ago If you read the other comments you’d see, I recorded on Xbox which saves clips from about 27 secs to 32 secs
You're goal keeper is more happy there
shushing someone after they've shushed you is top tier feeling
This *still* happens, garbage game
I bet youre the type of person that gets to elite while playing worse than silver 1 players too
    I’m not good enough for elite haha
I know he shushed you first, but just be the bigger man and take the W

Nice goal though
    Normally I would but adrenaline kicked in haha
This guy fought back to make it 3-3 and the shush was deserved. Your celebration after a bullshit goal is rather sour
You shushed hin back, thats toxic. If youre an L1 + R1 person dont contribute to the toxicity

Great goal tho. Even if you skipped the replay he would still be served with what he deserved mate
    I skipped every other one, I was just annoyed as I was doing challenges and needed wins and he shushed and adrenaline kicked in
    Nah, there’s nothing better than a revenge shush
So you scored some cheesey kickoff screamer in extra time when the game is looking to create excitement 


Cool
    Found OP’s opponent
    Don’t shit on other people’s achievements just because you can’t do it.
this has nothing to do with the other guy

had he done the respect celebration what would you have done ?

&#x200B;

yes, you'd have kicked off

had a wild shot

and posted showing your goal
    But I wouldn’t have shushed?
        its a video game and you are on about shushing, dear o dear
            Lol i knew since he did it, it would annoy him
                yeah, he'd have been fine with that goal had you not shushed

(note to self,  stop chatting with this fool)
                    Read the other comments mate, you’re in the minority here
                        shhhhhhhhhh
                            Looks like your note to self didn’t work
What how
Yet another reason not to ever play FUT and more evidence for scripting.
Bruh literally trying to get the last goal to win just because he had one more away goal
Bruh literally trying to get the last goal to win just because he had one more away goal
Bruh literally trying to get the last goal to win just because he had one more away goal
10 or 11 was ridiculously easy to score long range goals on.

EDIT: Like, so easy that straight up shooting from the circle at kickoff was a legitimate strategy lol.
    I had it on the wii, I was at the half way mark with iniesta at the far side of the pitch and shook my controller. Top bins
        Ah man fifa 09 on the wii with the big head mode is taking me back
            Yesss!!
            Holy shit haha. Back when in career mode Anderson becomes a 99 rated god
    It was fifa 11
    My friend once got a high ball from a weird angle and decided to shoot using neymar, it was that or let it get out of play. It was near the halfway line so I just pressed start to make my changes, not thinking anything would happen. We had a rule when playing 1vs1 that you only pause when the ball is out of play. My friend did not object this pause, but he said I bet it's gonna be a goal, and that made what happend so much worse because I laughed and took the bet. Equivalent of $5 or something. 
Since then I've hated Neymar. And still to this day I hate it when I face him. 

Game: fifa 10
Teams: Real Madrid - Barcelona
Final score: 0-1
        Neymar was still a Santos player in fifa 10 ..
            We did some edits for teams we wanted.
    Think it was fifa 12? I remember winning division one title in stoppage time from a free kick from about 50 yards out. You could normally score 1 in 10 or so.
        50 yards is 45.72 meters
    My cousins made me and my brother agree to never use Ronaldo off kick off. Even in FIFA 08at Man Utd he could score from the Center circle
        Omg I've been playing FIFA 08 on PS2 with my roommates and I swear to God that is the hardest FIFA I've ever played.
            Dude that FIFA caused me pain
    The number of goals I scored with Dani Alves from like midfield is disgusting
    You should try fifa 07 & pick Lampard… fifa 10 was refreshing in comparison
Fifa 14 Hernanes from the halfway line all day
    fifa 14 curling car post finesse from either side 40 yards out
Ye id normally rarely even score outside the box
    Shit always gets blocked
        I tried this pretty often just for the lulz, half the time the player taking kickoff would block the shot.. :\\
Dont forget those timed finesses from 40 yards out in FIFA 19.
    every time i think i maybe miss something about 19 i’m reminded of one of its hundreds of tragic failures
    I hated that more than anything.
Fifa 19 first timed finesse shots were so annoying
Cuz it was like
Even if you played good and the opponent gets one ok angle to take the first time finesse, you’re gone
It’s going in 100 %. It was annoying cuz even if you dominate the game whole time
The other player can just abuse this.
And let’s not forget el tornado crosses 
Spamming croquetas and infinite elasticos. Hated rhag shit.
        Its a double edged sword basically. I agree it was so frustrating. But I too exploited that and beat better opponents on different occasions.
            “The better player deserves the win”
This is why fifa sucks
Even rn
The network decides who’s the more skilled opponent
    Those were magical
Second that. Fifa 15 was gold!
    Happy cake day
People keep saying this, but I feel like I score at least one goal from outside the box per game or every other game at the least. Most of them are with 84 Promes, so it’s not like I’m using Cruyff or Eusebio. I usually just hit LT + RB + B and it’s no problem. Honestly I feel like it’s down to people’s connections, because I am by no stretch of the imagination an elite player.
    He’s talking about deeep goals. Like hitting it from half circle.
        I mean obviously I don’t score those pretty much at all, but I do still hit 25 and 30 yarders fairly frequently.
            Yeah, but those are nothing compared to how ridiculous some of the older fifas were. I still have videos of hitting 50 and 60 yarders against my buddies in fifa 14.
                That’s when fifa ultimate team was actually fun. You were playing with trading cards with ridiculous stats and ridiculous stuff would happen. 

Now those silver gods are trash compared to the god squads. I actually enjoyed playing more on the switch this year cause you actually play all gold teams and can score bangers.
                Yeah that’s what
I used to score from weird angles
From like 50 60 yards out.
It was so funny. This year I scored only
One in rivals
Cuz the gk came out for taking the goal kick
The guy probably didn’t realize
So I took advantage of that.
    why LT?
        Well, I started out doing it in squad battles in around I think October or November when there was the CSL icon swaps objective. I was using Teixeira who is one of those players that’s supposed to play higher than their rating, but I just couldn’t score with him no matter what. There was a shot where I was about to get bodied of the ball, so I did an LT + finesse, and it just shot right in. I started testing it with different players like my Promes and Koeman, and I at least think it adds a noticeable amount more curve to them. It also helps reduce some nearby players from blocking, because instead of being able to tackle they are fighting over the ball. It also definitely feels like it adds more power to regular shots, and when I’m through on goal from the top of the box after a one-two with Bazoer that’s the kind of shot I’ll use.
            i think the player shoots with more power as the player is in a standing position when you hold LT to protect the ball, but if it was an OP technique, people would have talked about it more often but i don't think it's a thing idk i might be wrong
                Honestly it might just be placebo,but it works for me so there’s no point in changing.
    Which position is the LT? cause I wanna know the PS4 equivalent for that
        L2
Long shots were good every year except this year
    im pretty tricky from the edges of the box
Scored a bicycle kick from like 30 yards fifa 15
    30 yards is 27.43 meters
TOTY Kroos was the god of long shots
Fifa 15 santi cazorla (and 17 for that matter) would bang long shots like finesse in 19 lol
Good, that shit needed to go
I don’t think I was ever as hyped from a goal, or even a pack
Simple Rick’s
    There was a guy who scored a last minute goal from the kickoff in his own half right after his opponent scored seconds before.

And the chemical it makes his brain secrete goes into every Simple Rick's Simple Wafer's Wafer Cookie. Come home to the impossible flavor of your own completion. Come home to Simple Rick's.
I really hope so
    You are just as toxic as this kid dude, if not much more
    C'mon I understand that sushing is annoying but you are being way more toxic rn imo.
        Issa joke chill
If it was me on the other end I wouldn't be mad, i'd just be impressed...
Not my least proud anyway..

            YOU WON'T BELIEVE THESE FIFA Myths
                Today's  a very special day
If you press home and then x on xbox, it only saves the last 30 seconds. He wasn't recording the whole game, he just quickly saved his goal. Of course that doesn't prove anything, but it's a perfectly reasonable explanation as to why the opponets shush wasn't included.
    You can actually program your xbox to record longer clips, I believe up to a minute. Mine is currently set at 45 seconds.
        I actually didn't know that, gonna have to check it out, thanks!
        It's way longer. Think it's max 5 minutes. I've got mine at 2 1/2 minutes.
            *10 mins
                 No, no, mine is at 60minutes
                    Oh shit of course there is a dev setting for 24HOURS, SHHHH.
            All depends on the quality. If it’s set to 1080p it only records 2 minutes
        Ye I know about it and will do it next time I post haha, didn’t expect people to care
            Who cares, that was a banger of a goal.
            Idc, I was just adding my 2 cents where it was unnecessary lol
        To further this, if you push the small button above the D-pad (looks like two boxes, not sure the proper name) you can choose to record up to the last 5 minutes of gameplay.
        Really? Ps4 we can record think it up to hour or half hour.
    Thank you, just wanted to post the goal haha didn’t expect people to care this much
        I guess they are on PS or PC, and maybe the way it's cut is just weird if you don't know how recording works on Xbox. For Xbox users it's probably obvious that you used home+x.
        Lol but it’s reddit ... all ppl do here is care so hard it hurts
    Im on xbox i know, he chose a very odd time to record it, its easiest to do as soon as the goal goes in or if you wanna celebrate like this guy surely you wouldn't leave it so late
        I don't know, if I'm trying to get back at my opponent, I celebrate first and record later. Otherwise I just skip and then save.

Same goes for other games as well, when I get a nice kill in CoD, I don't always save immediately, I make sure I have time to do it first. I think he just wanted to make sure he does the revenge celebration, and then pressed save once he knew it's done.
        I got the full goal and my celebration, that’s all I wanted to have
    Wow really? PS4 records the last 15 minutes. Another reason PS4 > Xbox
        I dont care about the consle war but also ps4 can be set to record the last 60 minutes.
Rumbled!!!
28 seconds is the typical length of captures on xbox
Seriously, makes no sense to exclude the original shush...
    Xbox only recorded last 30 seconds, didn’t know it would be cut out
        Then why is the video 29 seconds long?
            Read the other replies
                I did. If you recorded 30 seconds why is your video 29 seconds? 

I call bullshit.
                    All my Xbox clips range anywhere from 28 seconds to 32 seconds, think what you want but other people have confirmed this
        Gotya, amazing goal bro
        This video is 28 seconds though
            Idno most of my game clips are 28-32 seconds, I’m not too sure why, but anyway the extra two seconds would just be the replay of his goal surely since he didn’t skip
                I believe you
                Yeah. I am sure he did shush you. The FIFA community is aids with last minute watching goals knowing you can’t do the same  when u score since it’s game over
                    It's only gotten worse over the course of the year for me, too. So I definitely believe OP. I get shushed in probably 17 out of the 20 champs games I play now. lol
            If you have an xbox you’d know but the video clips are never exactly on time. My minute long records are anywhere from 58 seconds to 1 minute 3 seconds.
He in all likelihood didn't get shushed and just lied for the karma
It was a virtual shush
    In a reddit about the virtual players in a game... Mate if you wanna talk about shit like 9/11 or even a random fight in a pub a few months ago it's the wrong sub.
        *shuuuuush*
            You've done me there big man, dont think i come back from you doing that
He didn't skip the replay either tho.
Exactly......surely show evidence of the shush or it never happened.  Self defence but with no witness dear boy, I SMELL A MURDER!!!!
He did, I wish I recorded face cam for my reaction
    Hopefully he’s a regular in this sub
Cuz this game is scripted
    Was that with the shot button? because normally that would clear the ball
        Rb and x
            What does Rb (or R2) shot do?
                RB + shoot is a finesse shot, RB + lob is a lower, more driven aerial pass
                    Oh so it’s not even an actual shot?
                        Exactly
                        No it's a finesse shot (curled for exemple)
                It would be R1 on PS just a driven cross.
                It's not a shot, it's a driven lob pass.
    No it isn't. There is not such thing as Scripting you toxic shushing arsehole.
        Lollll calm down Issa game
Yea. Its from his own half aswell. Normally impossible
True, so unnecessary considering we skipped all replays until he scored in the 92nd
Is shushing really riling up people so hard? Because it does rile me up not gonna to lie
    Eh not as much as it used to. Some guy is just after shushing me for 4 goals just there and had no reaction to it. Just dont care anymore
        The Shushing that used to be in Fifa 13 ~14 before they changed it in the recent years, i dont know the exact year when they changed was even worse. That animation pissed me off way too much than the recent one.
            I believe they changed it in fifa 18
        Tbh I don’t mind it, just this time when we were skipping every replay and in the 90th min he does it
    the face celebration riles me up much much more
    if I'm skipping and not taunting, yeah, it pisses me off
He’s so good, got him in icon swaps
I’ve got the mid and now kinda want the baby for that ponytail hahahah
Fifa gods helping me
    That was your luck for the next 5 editions or something lol
        For that moment.. I’ll take it
Rb and x
    Just to be clear, is X shoot or cross?
        Cross
            Thought so. Thanks!
    Rb is bottom right bumper? The pace or the finesse button?
        Finesse, or r1 on ps
            Ah thank you. Great goal btw!
                Thanks :)
Fifa gods on my side for once
    One of the great goals
If only I had spanish commentary on
I used Rb and x
Didn’t even notice haha
Op said it was Rb and x (R1 and square)
    Thx dude
Rb and x haha, thanks
OMG hahahahhaa
89, not sure which that is, from icon swaps 2
gold Messi is only 650k on PS4 and 500k on xbox nowadays.

Ronaldinho on the other hand... 🤑🤑🤑
    Icon swaps, I spent €20 on points at the start of the game and that’s it
        That's impressive.
almost looks like a driven cross with crossing assistance disabled in the settings menu. I have no idea tho.
    I used Rb and x, dno about that crossing assistance tho
        is X your shot button on XBox?
            Nope B
Normally it just goes into the keepers hands aswell, guess it was look
    Yeah that one caused the keeper table
Like the ‘shhhh’ celebration
    But there is no shhh celebration in this video, where is it?
Hold Right stick to the right
Fifa 09 on the PSP, just shoot from a corner, it goes through the side of the net and it counts as a goal
    What that’s so mad 😂😂
For once haha
    Go open some packs mate now its the time!!!
Of course, tbh I just wanted to see the goal again
Love you too x
    I love you both
        I agree with you
Thankfully I don’t play weekend league
    That‘s good for your mental health)
Ye haha, they texted me asking for permission
The ‘ssshhhh’ celebration, basically dickhead move imo
    Got it. Thanks
Rb and x (R1 and square I think)
Rb and x
    Ok
I normally wouldn’t but I’ll admit I was so shook it went in and it happened
    Nah if someone shushes you, you gotta do it back. The only thing that may stop him is the taste of his own medicine.
        ohhhhhhhh so when other people shush they are toxic arseholes and ruining the game but it is alright for you to

&#x200B;

LMFFAO THIS SUB IS PATHETIC AF
    Whether he shushed or not that goal was so nice you have to shush!
I know well haha, karma is real
I used Rb and x
Also thank you haha
Rb and x
    So a driven lobbed pass? If you don’t change the default settings.
        Nope never even knew that made a difference tbh
Ye your man texted me asking if he can post it haha
    Lol

Bruh this was so long ago If you read the other comments you’d see, I recorded on Xbox which saves clips from about 27 secs to 32 secs
I’m not good enough for elite haha
Normally I would but adrenaline kicked in haha
I skipped every other one, I was just annoyed as I was doing challenges and needed wins and he shushed and adrenaline kicked in
Nah, there’s nothing better than a revenge shush
Found OP’s opponent
Don’t shit on other people’s achievements just because you can’t do it.
But I wouldn’t have shushed?
    its a video game and you are on about shushing, dear o dear

            yeah, he'd have been fine with that goal had you not shushed

You are just as toxic as this kid dude, if not much more
C'mon I understand that sushing is annoying but you are being way more toxic rn imo.

        YOU WON'T BELIEVE THESE FIFA Myths
            Today's  a very special day
You can actually program your xbox to record longer clips, I believe up to a minute. Mine is currently set at 45 seconds.
    I actually didn't know that, gonna have to check it out, thanks!
    It's way longer. Think it's max 5 minutes. I've got mine at 2 1/2 minutes.
        *10 mins
             No, no, mine is at 60minutes
                Oh shit of course there is a dev setting for 24HOURS, SHHHH.
        All depends on the quality. If it’s set to 1080p it only records 2 minutes
    Ye I know about it and will do it next time I post haha, didn’t expect people to care
        Who cares, that was a banger of a goal.
        Idc, I was just adding my 2 cents where it was unnecessary lol
    To further this, if you push the small button above the D-pad (looks like two boxes, not sure the proper name) you can choose to record up to the last 5 minutes of gameplay.
    Really? Ps4 we can record think it up to hour or half hour.
Thank you, just wanted to post the goal haha didn’t expect people to care this much
    I guess they are on PS or PC, and maybe the way it's cut is just weird if you don't know how recording works on Xbox. For Xbox users it's probably obvious that you used home+x.
    Lol but it’s reddit ... all ppl do here is care so hard it hurts
Im on xbox i know, he chose a very odd time to record it, its easiest to do as soon as the goal goes in or if you wanna celebrate like this guy surely you wouldn't leave it so late
    I don't know, if I'm trying to get back at my opponent, I celebrate first and record later. Otherwise I just skip and then save.

Same goes for other games as well, when I get a nice kill in CoD, I don't always save immediately, I make sure I have time to do it first. I think he just wanted to make sure he does the revenge celebration, and then pressed save once he knew it's done.
    I got the full goal and my celebration, that’s all I wanted to have
Wow really? PS4 records the last 15 minutes. Another reason PS4 > Xbox
    I dont care about the consle war but also ps4 can be set to record the last 60 minutes.
Xbox only recorded last 30 seconds, didn’t know it would be cut out
    Then why is the video 29 seconds long?
        Read the other replies
            I did. If you recorded 30 seconds why is your video 29 seconds? 

I call bullshit.
                All my Xbox clips range anywhere from 28 seconds to 32 seconds, think what you want but other people have confirmed this
    Gotya, amazing goal bro
    This video is 28 seconds though
        Idno most of my game clips are 28-32 seconds, I’m not too sure why, but anyway the extra two seconds would just be the replay of his goal surely since he didn’t skip
            I believe you
            Yeah. I am sure he did shush you. The FIFA community is aids with last minute watching goals knowing you can’t do the same  when u score since it’s game over
                It's only gotten worse over the course of the year for me, too. So I definitely believe OP. I get shushed in probably 17 out of the 20 champs games I play now. lol
        If you have an xbox you’d know but the video clips are never exactly on time. My minute long records are anywhere from 58 seconds to 1 minute 3 seconds.
In a reddit about the virtual players in a game... Mate if you wanna talk about shit like 9/11 or even a random fight in a pub a few months ago it's the wrong sub.
    *shuuuuush*
        You've done me there big man, dont think i come back from you doing that
Hopefully he’s a regular in this sub
Was that with the shot button? because normally that would clear the ball
    Rb and x
        What does Rb (or R2) shot do?
            RB + shoot is a finesse shot, RB + lob is a lower, more driven aerial pass
                Oh so it’s not even an actual shot?
                    Exactly
                    No it's a finesse shot (curled for exemple)
            It would be R1 on PS just a driven cross.
            It's not a shot, it's a driven lob pass.
No it isn't. There is not such thing as Scripting you toxic shushing arsehole.
    Lollll calm down Issa game
Eh not as much as it used to. Some guy is just after shushing me for 4 goals just there and had no reaction to it. Just dont care anymore
    The Shushing that used to be in Fifa 13 ~14 before they changed it in the recent years, i dont know the exact year when they changed was even worse. That animation pissed me off way too much than the recent one.
        I believe they changed it in fifa 18
    Tbh I don’t mind it, just this time when we were skipping every replay and in the 90th min he does it
the face celebration riles me up much much more
if I'm skipping and not taunting, yeah, it pisses me off
That was your luck for the next 5 editions or something lol
    For that moment.. I’ll take it
Just to be clear, is X shoot or cross?
    Cross
        Thought so. Thanks!
Rb is bottom right bumper? The pace or the finesse button?
    Finesse, or r1 on ps
        Ah thank you. Great goal btw!
            Thanks :)
One of the great goals
Thx dude
Icon swaps, I spent €20 on points at the start of the game and that’s it
    That's impressive.
I used Rb and x, dno about that crossing assistance tho
    is X your shot button on XBox?
        Nope B
Yeah that one caused the keeper table
But there is no shhh celebration in this video, where is it?
What that’s so mad 😂😂
Go open some packs mate now its the time!!!
I love you both
    I agree with you
That‘s good for your mental health)
Got it. Thanks
Ok
Nah if someone shushes you, you gotta do it back. The only thing that may stop him is the taste of his own medicine.
    ohhhhhhhh so when other people shush they are toxic arseholes and ruining the game but it is alright for you to

&#x200B;

LMFFAO THIS SUB IS PATHETIC AF
Whether he shushed or not that goal was so nice you have to shush!
So a driven lobbed pass? If you don’t change the default settings.
    Nope never even knew that made a difference tbh
Lol
Yes
    Just seen there haha, thanks mate
Oh you’re on Xbox. So I assume you crossed it into the box
its a video game and you are on about shushing, dear o dear
    Lol i knew since he did it, it would annoy him
        yeah, he'd have been fine with that goal had you not shushed

(note to self,  stop chatting with this fool)
            Read the other comments mate, you’re in the minority here
                shhhhhhhhhh
                    Looks like your note to self didn’t work
Ah man fifa 09 on the wii with the big head mode is taking me back
    Yesss!!
    Holy shit haha. Back when in career mode Anderson becomes a 99 rated god
Neymar was still a Santos player in fifa 10 ..
    We did some edits for teams we wanted.
50 yards is 45.72 meters
Omg I've been playing FIFA 08 on PS2 with my roommates and I swear to God that is the hardest FIFA I've ever played.
    Dude that FIFA caused me pain
I tried this pretty often just for the lulz, half the time the player taking kickoff would block the shot.. :\\
Its a double edged sword basically. I agree it was so frustrating. But I too exploited that and beat better opponents on different occasions.
    “The better player deserves the win”
This is why fifa sucks
Even rn
The network decides who’s the more skilled opponent
I mean obviously I don’t score those pretty much at all, but I do still hit 25 and 30 yarders fairly frequently.
    Yeah, but those are nothing compared to how ridiculous some of the older fifas were. I still have videos of hitting 50 and 60 yarders against my buddies in fifa 14.
        That’s when fifa ultimate team was actually fun. You were playing with trading cards with ridiculous stats and ridiculous stuff would happen. 

Now those silver gods are trash compared to the god squads. I actually enjoyed playing more on the switch this year cause you actually play all gold teams and can score bangers.
        Yeah that’s what
I used to score from weird angles
From like 50 60 yards out.
It was so funny. This year I scored only
One in rivals
Cuz the gk came out for taking the goal kick
The guy probably didn’t realize
So I took advantage of that.
Well, I started out doing it in squad battles in around I think October or November when there was the CSL icon swaps objective. I was using Teixeira who is one of those players that’s supposed to play higher than their rating, but I just couldn’t score with him no matter what. There was a shot where I was about to get bodied of the ball, so I did an LT + finesse, and it just shot right in. I started testing it with different players like my Promes and Koeman, and I at least think it adds a noticeable amount more curve to them. It also helps reduce some nearby players from blocking, because instead of being able to tackle they are fighting over the ball. It also definitely feels like it adds more power to regular shots, and when I’m through on goal from the top of the box after a one-two with Bazoer that’s the kind of shot I’ll use.
    i think the player shoots with more power as the player is in a standing position when you hold LT to protect the ball, but if it was an OP technique, people would have talked about it more often but i don't think it's a thing idk i might be wrong
        Honestly it might just be placebo,but it works for me so there’s no point in changing.
