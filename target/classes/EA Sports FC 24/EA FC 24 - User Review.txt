[[EA FC 24 - User Review]]


EA FC 24 is a huge step back from FIFA 23. The game is sluggish, more exploitative, not fun at all. So many things are broken.

Tackling...too easy, ball is constantly changing possession every two seconds.  In real football, defenders hold back in respect, so on-ball players have time with the ball at their feet. In this game, you have to spam pass just to avoid onslaught of spam tackling.

Dribbling....due to ease of spam tackling, pushing, shirt tugging, you have to constantly excessively finesse dribble - slow then fast, forward then back, left then right, over and over, just to move the ball down the pitch. It's incredibly annoying and causes migraines.

Play Styles ...contradict player ratings. A top overall player ratings-wise excelled at a range of things. But now, without certain play style abilities, they're dumbed down in those facets of play, while worse players with those Play Style abilities are better at those facets. I understand the idea to individualize players, but player ratings on their own worked better. EA would've been better off adding new attributes like Arial, Block, Travella, etc, instead of creating Play Styles. Ratings allows for separation of skills between best and worst players, whereas abilities you either have it or not.

Passing....to add to the ordeal of the tackling and constant possession change, too many passes are intercepted, blocked, ricochet, or go wide of their target. All because to push the Precision Passing mechanics, which in itself isn't reliable or something you can use as a replacement to regular passing.

Player Positioning ...goalkeepers are worse than before, too often out of position or useless. Attacking players in the box are worse than before, too stationary or don't get into space. Crosses or cutbacks often don't go to them at all, again to promote use of Precision Passing mechanics.

Mechanics...the game is bogged down with mechanics, old and new mechanics. Too much emphasis on that...precision passing, skill moves, hypermotion, tactical defending, play styles, etc etc. Too many unstable moving parts, this isn't a Swiss watch.

Overall, it's a wretched experience. The free-flowing, free-wheeling nature of FIFA 23 is gone. F23 had its flaws, not like real football, but FC24 has gone the other way, trying to be too tactical, structured, and confined that it also isn't like real football. Neither is like real football, but FC24 is an ordeal. F23 at least you could enjoy it. 

Remember, real football is fun to play. It's free-flowing. Players don't charge into you constantly tackling, pushing, pulling and diving. They hold their ground, compress.

Future patches....focus on nerfing tackling, instead emphasizing jockeying and sealing, the defense and capable AI compressing space. Players should have time with the ball at their feet, play is free-flowing, but they have to find a way around or thru a compressing defense, rather than being met with an onslaught of charging defenders rough-housing them up and down the pitch. Not a game of constant turnovers from rough tackles, but a game of doing something creative with your opportunity with the ball across an equal share of possession.


Worst game that EA have ever made. Scripting still exists, but now worse than ever, even in career mode. Absolute waste of money
    completely agree, this is hands down the worst value game i have ever bought. i wont be buying fifa 25
    yeh I thought id always be safe as a fifa player mainly enjoying manager mode. apparently not, oh well at least I never have to think about playing the most up to date game anymore
    Not really . It's the best since FIFA 22 anyway
        Only graphics makes it very good
        You are obviously have no idea what a game is😂
            shitty opinion followed by smugness 101
        Idk bro, tbh I recently started playing fc24 and some shit that happens in the field is surreal bro, a lot of glitches that didn’t happen in fifa 22 or 23
            All the numbers in your comment added up to 69. Congrats!

      24
    + 22
    + 23
    = 69

Completely agree … sucks because I got into UT during 23 and now 24 is making me not want to play anymore. The gameplay is simply not fun and that’s the most important part. Defensive pressure feels even more suffocating and since passing and dribbling is nerfed it’s harder to get around. People wanted stronger tackling and defense? I felt it was already too op on 23 and bailed out bad defenders. Honeslty the devs seem to want to lower skill gap, similar to other franchises who all want to appeal to the common denominator gamer. Game almost simulates itself at points to boost low skill player egos and keep them spending $…
    Fifa 23 was the best game
        didnt fifa 23 get horrible reviews as well when it came out? this happens every time they make a new sports game. not just fifa. it gets called the "worst one yet" and then after everyone gets used to it they call the next one horrible once again
            Like it's not the exact same sport every in edition lmao
    You can try again. I think EA just updated the new patch that fix defending better. Now i can tackle precisely and feel like defender got fixed better. They also nerf the hold r1 dribbling ( imo which is so stupid and not realistic) so it is good to play now
Definitely the worst fifa so far, I've always been pretty good at fifa but this game is just a complete mess! Ai is terrible, constantly leaving open spaces for the opponent to run through. Seems like you have to try control 3 players at once just to be able to defend. 100% regret spending my money on this game.
    This is so true. Defenders are often in dream land. So so bad
    The defenders are constantly on their heals, it makes breaks impossible to stop.  The game is essentially see who can score more.  The amount of cushion real Madrid gets is insane, how is Rodrygo the best player alive?
I respectfully disagree with almost everything here.  Tackling is better strong rather than weak. If tackling sucked you’d have 10+ goals a game. 

Dribbling is fine. It’s risk reward. Being able to skill move provides an advantage sure. But you need the skill to do it. 

Play styles I think offer the game much more variety in the types of players to use. 

Passing is annoying yes. But once I learned and adjusted to the game it’s been a lot less annoying. 

The positioning and in the box defense is the only thing I agree with. Way to easy to get in the box and do whatever you want. I think this gameplay has been the most enjoyable for me in years. Really enjoying the game. 

The FUT content has also been very good in 
my opinion as well.
    Unsure how you can disagree with almost everything. It’s a true fact, if you make a tackle it throws your defender half way across the pitch. Play styles don’t offer the game much more variety, it’s pointless to even have any players who don’t have 3/4 play styles…. They’re completely useless otherwise. You can say ‘skill issue’ but when players like myself in Div 2 and Div 1 are saying the game, it’s clearly not a skill issue. 

Everyone can just spam R1 dribble and walk past the entire defence in the box. The game is literally forcing everyone to not even try to defend, it’s forcing everyone to use A.I to do everything for them in regards to defending in the box. Is that how a game should be? 

There is literally no point playing a game if the A.I does the main things for you….
    Same except for the content, but it's tough to make a real call on that just yet. The playstyles are awesome.
        As a premier league guy they’ve dropped a few nice cards for me. SBCs too. But coming from madden, the content is 100x better than the shit they were dropping
    lol. What about now?
        Still enjoying the game. Feel like I’m finally starting to grasp some of the deeper gameplay mechanics and dribbling and all that. Been winning more games obviously I’ve been having fun. As a PL squad I wish they dropped more PL players instead of pointless Eridivese players like today lol. But whatever. I do almost every cheap SB just to do it. Did 30 of the 80+ SBC packs and got some good high overall fodder out of my pointless golds. W by EA for that.
            There isn't a single FIFA24 player who doesn't have grey hair yet due to all the bugs and unrealistic gameplay this game provides. Idk if you're coping but the game is absolute dogwater. Not to mention the pay2win aspect of it and the fact that you have to be a nolifer and you have to follow the meta in order to win. You don't even need skill to play this game anymore, just +W with Mbappe on the left wing and win. Also if you encounter a slight loss of package you instantly get disconnected and get punished for it instead of getting a pause like in other multiplayer games. And a fifa game doesn't even take that long for it to not have an auto pause option after a minimal package loss. Not to mention the amount of times the ref ends half / game in super advantageous situations, even decides not to give corner kicks and free kicks because of that. Defending is worse than any of the fifa games I've played so far, players literally freeze and do absolutely nothing. Players are faster on the ball than players off the ball which is absolute bullshit, etc. etc... I won't be buying next fifa for sure, even if it's for free, I've had enough of this ignorant and capitalistic organisation.
    You’re clearly a pay to win player, as someone who has been playing this game avidly for YEARS, and was a consistent Div 3/2 player, the game has never been worse. It’s more glitches and broken OP AI controlled movement, tackles and auto-blocks than actual football, the amount of times people have gotten tackles on my players by genuinely phasing through my player, I cannot count. I have never seen more icons or 5m+ teams in my entire life, it’s more pay to win now than it has ever been. Plus, it’s scripted to all fuck, I literally have had goalkeepers either jump 5m into the air to save (what in reality) would be an impossible save, or they have been half way through a save animation in one direction, for the ball to deflect and then goalkeeper still saves it in the other direction. Easily the worst UT they’ve ever made in the 12 or so years of it being active. The ironic thing is, Andrew Wilson SLATED FIFA when parting ways. Burnt that bridge, for him to literally make the worst FIFA ever the first time they’re independent. I mean the company is CONTROLLED by an Aussie who doesn’t give a fuck about the sport, just the money it generates. In the FC24 announcement event, he literally talked about other sports and loving them 😂😂😂
        Which is why there should be more modes for bronze and silver teams.

Playing with all 70-80 players are a requirement could be endlessly fun for good players. But then again, those 5million icon teams, those are billions in fifa point purchase for EA. They would never change that.
    Since when do you play Fifa ? I play it every year since 24 years and i can assure you this is by far the worst one.
    Stop working for EA and get a decent job.
    sorry, this is something i would write only if i woke up with paranoid schizo one day, the game is a total piece of garbage, complete mess, i had to stop playing it after a week
    And the add to the point, I was a consistent Div 3/2 player, now it’s impossible for me to do ANYTHING in Div 5. Because everyone is pay to win
Online experience is terrible. Always pauses and then speeds up in every game. Career mode is predictable. Professional is too easy and world class is ridiculously difficult. No happy medium. It's just the same as always over hyped and nothings changed. Needs a new engine and complete overhaul. Won't be buying another EA football game until there is drastic changes
    Yeah the whole new engine, new code, built from the ground up is what's needed but something EA won't do. There's a ton of legacy code from older FIFA games. Just adding layers on. Year to year release, they rely on that. A total rebuild would take several years, like when a developer is set to release a new game/IP and it takes them three years or so before it releases.

I find Konami's eFootball a better representation of simulation football.
I completely agree with you. There are so many great ideas that have been implemented unfortunately I don't feel like they have been executed nor do they perform very well. You do have alot if exploits in game which unfortunately everyone but me i play against seems to be able to utilise! I'm not an outstanding player but I've been playing fifa for years so I'm not a newbie.. really disappointed in this game and if I'm honest I wish I never spent the money on it.
This game is absolute crap. Everything about the game is broken, you have to do the same thing every game and it is very boring. Worst ea game i have ever played, i can't believe we've come so downhill.
    It's a real chore, not fun at all
The biggest problems I have is ai movement of my players off the ball , defenders just drop and drop into your own box to defend then you attack and they just all stand still. Anyone who says tacking isn't broken clearly likes at abuse glitches. And don't even get started on the refs
    Yep. At least a balance between allowing AI defenders to still do their jobs, but also some manual control needed for advanced gamers. F23 was let AI defense do everything. FC24 is constantly switching.

On attack, the AI fully controls your attackers, and you cannot allow for any manual control on attack (impossible), as you are focused on dribbling etc, so why should defense be forced to be all manual switching just to do their basic jobs? Just their basic jobs, tracking players, staying mobile and active, plugging lanes , keeping their shape  etc.
        Yeah I agree , 23 was far to easy just sit there let the ai doit. This fida is almost un playable , got my cb marking a striker 15-20 yards deeper than any other defender playing them all on side takes one touch and hea out the game. Goal keeper call out is just as bugged
            EA needs to find the middle area between what F23 was and what FC24 is. They've gone full opposite in both games. And yeah, I didn't go in depth on the goalkeeping issues in FC24, so many areas of concern that weren't there in F23.
    With my team is the opposite. CBs just come straight for the ball in a counter-attack scenario, leaving loads of space for the opp to run into. 

Scoring has been extremely difficult as well, for the opp GK does extreme saves in cases of rebounds, almost teleporting from one side to the other. And obviously, mine just lets every ball go through.
First one I've played since FUT 13 and now I remember why I stopped.
The game is 5/10 at best.Yes, the ball goes back and forward very fast. You can just tackle your way out of most things which is inherently unrealistic. Don't bother trying to dribble unless you do ball control. Something the game is fast, sometimes slow. It's very weird. In my opinion, this game is not good, FIFA 23 wasn't either. I liked FIFA 22 and downward. They try to make it more realistic, and while the graphics are much better and like the newer, more in-depth skill for players, the gameplay just feels like a new sport. I am a good defender, more than attack, and the new FIFA just took that away from me :'D
    I found my bro, fifa 22 was one of the best in my opinion too
EA is still on the same wave as 23 lol this game is poorly made and none what so ever better game play, I tried contacting someone from EA and they told me “EVERYONE HAS THE SAME CHANCE OF WINNING” then I sent them a screen play recording of my experience showing them the game speed is slow, kicking aim is off, when playing someone from Mexico or another country there is none what so ever same game play connection, your literally watching the other team attack me from different angles moving fast and your seeing me pressing the pass button multiple times just trying to beat the game speed lag of connection but yet they then said to me “it’s maybe your internet connection” and told them exactly this, “my guy I’m connected directly into my modem at 600mbps internet how much faster do I need to play the damn game” 🤦🏻‍♂️ I even offered to let them play 😂
Football games peaked with the mid 2000s Pro Evos, and you can't change my mind.
I really hate this game and I'm pretty good at it but what I hate the most is the community, fking immature pieces of sh*t, wasting time from the 65th minute of the game just because they got a lucky goal and using the greedy emote,people who are losing 4-0 then stop playing hoping that you will eventually leave the game, if you are one these people, go f*ck yourself sincerely and I hope you get matched with sh*tty people just like yourself.  Good day and f*ck EA 
    How about wasting time from the 5th minute  once they score an early goal from a cheesey angle. Gloating and passing the ball around, playing keep off, using goalkick glitch wheh behind to try to get a goal back, etc. The community sucks, immature ragers. And the gane itself is so arcade really.
 All the reviews from the official review websites big guys actually pretty good, it makes me think they are in EAs pocket because the game is RUBBISH also PAY TO WIN.
It's disgusting that lots of player got Haaland because they bought the game earlier and put the rest of the players in massive disadvantage because the guy was scoring for fun with his beefed stats.
To do SBCs pretty pointless, as you almost never gets any usable player, mostly downgrade your traded cards .
If you do 500 SBCs you usually get about 488 totally shit cards. .
I totally understand that EA wants to do tonnes of money, but come on you just can't win with the SBCs it's beyond jokes.
Now EA wants people to buy monthly and yearly pass with rewards which again will put people in disadvantage who will not opting to do it.
We already paid for the game but it is not a fair game anymore.
Can't wait for FIFA to come out with they game end of this year.
It was my last EA game.
Somebody please tell me how on earth gets this game 7 out of 10 review rating from most of the big gaming sites??
Must be a scam.
WHAT IS YOUR RATING???
Please let me know guys
FIFA 23 was just as bad, as long as ea keep releasing games and you keep playing them, you will never be happy looool
They could have called the game RM24
Worst game I’ve ever played
Completely agree. I’m only a casual career mode player and decided to buy it last night. It feels like an arcade game to me, they have apparently ‘improved’ the animation but something is off with it that makes it feel triggered and not seamless at all. The player models look like they been pulled from Fortnight, not sure why they changed the art style. Skin looks like shiny plastic. Game play feels very sluggish. Glad people are enjoying it though, each to their own.
Another moany post. Your review is perfect for FIFA 23. 

I'm really enjoying EA FC 24. 23 was awful had to stop playing it. This is good so far. I am more worried at what they'll do over the next year to break it and then it into FIFA 23
    Don't get me wrong.....FIFA 23 was very cheesey, exploitative. Slower paced players were unusable. It wasn't a good football simulation, but at the very least you could say it was fun to play because it was more free flowing by nature.

I'm not saying FC24 is rubbish and unplayable, but it is an ordeal....mainly due to the constant turnover of the ball due to the bump in tackling and rough-housing and all the intercepts, ricochets, etc due to the nerfed passing. Having to excessively dribble is also a chore.

And just in terms of structure or coding of the game....play styles spoils the player ratings. It is emphasized over player ratings, because top players who lack a specific ability are worse at it than lesser players who have that ability. They could've just added new categories in player ratings like Blocking, Flair, Bruising, etc etc, and just had players rated across those various categories to get a difference. Player ratings on their own work really well.
i completely agree with this, the worst value game i have ever bought, an embarrassment to football and gaming
I tought Fifa 23 was worst,, but after i play FC 24,, I feel like going to the store and have them give you your money back for it, if I hadn't bought it together with the PS5,(it was a promotion) I would have done it, I would have gone to the store to give my money back for it, this game on Ultimate doesn't start from a draw , always the opponent's team always has better speed, passes faster even if they don't have top players, that's the most annoying thing, I start playing career MODE,, and I want to stop getting angry, Ea , sucks like always.
    I feel your pain. The other day in Seasons, I couldn't get a single win, tumbled from div5 to div10. Next day, couldn't lose, from div10 to div5 again. Started FC24 couldn't lose, then lost like 50 in a row. Next day, win a lot more. Next day, back to losing every game. Etc. And it's always silly scripted things, a bounce back, constant hitting posts, players letting balls go by them, taking air swings on one-twos, multiple red cards while they get away with MMA takedowns, etc.

The worst thing about EAs game is all the mechanisms running underneath as I mentioned in the OP. The game is far too locked in to them, too much scripting happens. Aspects like tackling, intercepts, playstyles, etc, need to be nerfed/tweaked in multiple patches just to make the game breathe a little because it's far too gridlocked a game out of the box.

There are many things going on underneath the surface of the game code that affect every moment, the outcome of possessions, the outcome of games. It seldom feels organic or free will-like. Things allowed to happen all game preordained, or things not allowed to happen all game preordained ... headers, through balls, AI defensive shapes, fineese shots, bounce of the ball, etc etc.
I kept 3 clean sheets in a row as Citeh career and thought now this is realistic without scoring many ?...then i played Fulham at Home and got smashed 0-6...way worse than last year where i smashed it with most saves and i gotta admit loved it...this 1 is more testing and frustrating it looks good but the gameplay is a mess..just yet anyway
    It's far more frustrating (in a bad way) thats for sure.
        Day 2 and luvit...I just need to hold the shoot button that little bit longer than usual..absolutely flying on Leeds Utd save...9 wins 1 draw and 2 losses and top of the pops after 12 league games..
Fc 24 is the worst game ever made. The game just sucks
Yeah, horrendous game. Full of bugs. Constantly doing things you don't intend. Game play is nice, seems more realistic. But just so bad every where else
    Respectfully, the gameplay might be the worst I’ve ever seen, players don’t move off the ball, constant glitching when your defending against the CPU, the gameplay itself might be the worst part often he game tbh. Also your players are so fucking slow, Harry Maguire caught Ousmane Dembele on my career mode the other day from behind and that was the last straw.
Why do people still buy this game though? It's clear the devs don't care about anything the community thinks...this game has not been good in years and every year, addicted consumers go and buy it  cause of some fraudulent gimmick that ends up costing more than  the last game. You enjoy it for the first couple of weeks and than the patch takes you back to square 1. We are all fools for falling for this every year. Pathetic!!!
    It's because people love football, and video games, and there aren't any/many options out there. eFootball is a decent alternative gameplay-wise, but it lacks content and official teams, so it has to be EA's game...pretty much a monopoly.

Hopefully, FIFAs stand alone game is a genuine challenger to EAs FC game.
        Also the game is very promoted by streamers who have special accounts made by ea to pack a lot of good players to influence the viewers to buy the game. Indeed its a monopoly and the enterpricing is huge. Even if you say to yourself that you won t buy the next game, the fact that you love football and you are competitive forces you to buy it. Its a vicios cycle
Worst game I have ever played in my life. Constantly feels like my players are on half speed, horrid touch, other team constantly has magnets attached to their boots and the fastest players known to man. Will never buy an EA game again.
Worst game I’ve ever played.
This game is total shit, literally server lags with every pass every Tackle every shoot. Shit game nothing else. EA you are complete piece of shit If I couldn't fix your servers. We have paid for this game, not playing it for free you shit heads. FIX IT
Horrible game… players mess up just to shift momentum in the game is stupid…game changing players for you to help the other team score automatically to force a goal…defenders leaving attackers to allow a goal hahaa quitting fifa after 15 years…
I love the end that’s too accurate .. when you play AI you’ll be able to relate .. I easily lose possession a lot and I’m always covered up which makes it more difficult to find a passing option .. I easily concede penalties as well .. easier to miss goal scoring opportunities and passing accuracy is terrible .. outside foot shot can never be compared to fifa 23
[removed]
    At this point I totally agree with you. Every year the first couple months are really worth to play because of new game style and everyone doesn’t have a fast card yet. Now with all of fast pace cards release which i think it make no sense is killing the market. Im done w Ut this year, just build my team around fav players.
The head to head matchmaking is worth 0 stars.
The game is garbage
Been playing a bit of Konami's eFootball 2024....

Now this game far more feels and plays like real football. Better player movement, better replays  better offside graphics, much better commentary, isn't overloaded with mechanisms in the game, actual stick skills. Players defend as they should, if you make an ill-timed standing tackle, it's a foul. Players have time with the ball at their feet, but space compresses as it should. Goal shooting and heading is far more rewarding and natural. In-game strategies and game management are a lot more intuitive.

The game isn't as graphically polished as FC24, and lacks the licensing etc, so the game is more bare bones in these regards, different content etc. But the actual gameplay is superb, more organic.

If only you could merge the two games, bringing together the best aspects of each.
Agree you can't beat 1-1 if you don't do skill moves which is very unrealistic plus there auto pressing in clubs which is really annoying.
Worst game made by EA by far
Piece of shit, like EA...
Nobody who understands sports , physics or logic can enjoy this game.
NOT RECOMMANDED, This game full broken, u feel like ur players need to do some fitness they fat  asf, i have 4 ping and good pc, this game is just not ready for play, and i have high team quality.
The defending is so horrible in this one. I didn’t struggle at all on defense in fifa 22 or 23. It feels like you have to control 2 or 3 guys just to not give them a scoring chance.
    Yeah it's over the top, you can't just try to defend the player with the ball but two or three off ball players at all times. Don't have to do that when you are attacking, so there's no justification for that imbalance.
This new update didn't even add back starting lineups before kickoff in career mode 😒 😤 very disappointed with f24
Agree with a lot of this. 

Goalkeeping is absolutely atrocious. Simple shots that should be held are being parried out for needless corners or worse, into the net.

Defending is not enjoyable. You try to press, they pass around you and find ridiculous amounts of open space due to the 2nd and 3rd defenders (AI) being so poor in terms of positioning. You try to contain and they take a huge touch out of feet and accelerate. You try to anticipate this and your defender looks like he’s running in sand.

Midfielders are passive and take up poor positions. They frequently don’t track back and you end up defending an overloaded attack.

CPU’s ability to use strength to shield the ball, win duels etc. is something the player can only dream of. In most situations where you think you might have actually gotten the better of them, the whistle does and they retain possession in the form of a free kick.

Same old cut scenes with dialogue that doesn’t make sense with regards to the season you’re having or form you’re displaying. They have not addressed some spelling mistakes that were in FIFA 23. The career mode has clearly not been properly tested.

I’ve owned every FIFA game since it came out in 1993. I bought FC24 at 40% off and still feel I overpaid. This is one of the most disappointing releases in recent years. I can only hope the experience improves with updates.
    Wow that's exactly how I felt, also the overall gameplay is really sluggish, the extra microseconds each players take to make a pass makes the pace slower, even when I press the pass before the player receives the ball. 

Btw having owned all fifa games, which is your no1?
        I liked 17 because it was the first time in a long time I felt they put some effort into something other than FUT. Career mode was broadened and of course it was the first time we had the Alex Hunter story mode.
guys i got a question, since i've never played anything else from ea except titanfall 2, do i need ea play subscription to play fc 24 online or nah? would love to get your guys opinions. Thanks
    If you're on console, you only need to subscribe to playstation plus or xbox gamepass to be able to play online.
        and if I'm on pc?
            Then you'll need to subscribe to EA Play
                Don't think so, PC should be free to play online (I do)
fix the ultimate team random card given out
I agree. Game is absolute sh!t.
FC24 is complete garbage!!!
EA FC SHOULD NEVER MAKE A FOOTBAL GAME EVER AGAIN.
I don’t recommend this fifa24 it’s waste of money it’s really such a
    Fill in the blank lol
This game is actually a glitchy piece of shit
This game is extremely scripted, it’s so bad.
This game is too easy. 32-1-1 atm in seasons. Need more scripting
I couldnt agree more. As a division 9 yes idc i just wanted to give it a go and i had been playing a tiny bit of f22 and 23 and i couldnt agree less, in division 9 i get pay to win teams and with the game mechanics its impossible ive been at the last checkpoint for 2 weeks now and im sick of haaland, he is overpowerd and stupid. I wont be playing f25. This game isnt fun even if you win.
I need help. So I stopped gaming for 4 years now I am  gaming again until the end of 2024 then I will get busy in my studies again and the last fifa i had was fifa 17 and it was an amazing game. I really love fifa and I want to get back into it and right now fc 24 is in discount. I really want a new fifa because fifa 17 is too old now. Should I just buy it because I need a new fifa anyways and I will be playing until the end of 2024 anyways. Or is it actually that bad that I should not buy it. I am on ps4 btw
    It’s garbage save your money
I've give up buying fifa like 10 years ago...occasionally Im playing at friends house.... and it's funny that year after year always the same problem...if you are winning everything goes easy every chance you create its a goal...but if you loosing...the match engine makes the game just ridiculous!!!....you make perfect tackles the ball bounce back no matter what you do...the GK of your opponent becomes a super Schmeichel and stops everything and when it doesn't stop the ball hit the post 4/5 times...my players passing becomes poor and the opponent anticipation becomes perfect. To finish even when you tackle and you get the ball don't worry because the referee is there. Basically everything in the game goes against you. You can be a super team and play really well but you will loose
    I think there's something more sinister to it. It's the "pay to win" in effect. 

People who spend real money in the game get rewarded more than people who don't. They score goals with every long shot, never miss. Their players are incredibly faster. Your AI defenders decide to rush up and out of position all the time. The players you swap to are always the wrong choice. They can MMA you all over the park no fouls but you breathe on them and it's cards. Their GKs save everything. Their players get all the rebounds. Your own shots suddenly always miss and hit the posts. Etc etc.

You can tell them apart because they do that flapping bird celebration which isn't free. And they play out their celebrations and goal replays extra long that you can't skip, but they can cancel your own celebrations.
The tackling and player movement is the worst I’ve ever seen, it’s literally impossible to win the ball off the cpu even if you time everything right. I know that Ultimate difficulty should be hard, but don’t make it hard based on glitches. Also your players never move off the ball they all just stand there. Defenders just drop back and don’t attack either. Very disappointing game, EA needs to understand that we don’t want new features or game modes, we want better gameplay, and they’ve somehow managed to make it worse.
I bought a ps5 in 2022 and FIFA 23 with it. I usually never buy FIFA games every year. Before that I had a PS4 and I played FIFA 18 on it which I had since release. They're all a waste of money overall with every game being exactly the same as the last.
    Theyre essentially the same....same base engine, animations, arcade movements....but EA keeps adding new shit mechanics and ideas like Play Styles and Precision Passing, and messing with the balance of things....so the games generally get progressively worse.
Been playing every Fifa since Fifa 2000. And i can tell you this is by far the worst one i have played, without exaggerating the game play is a complete mess. Very difficult to defend, players are so clunky and slow, shooting is just horrible. They think they are making it more realistic but they're just ruining it. And there are more scripts than ever, god forbid you leading 2-0 because all your players are gonna have a rating of 19 until the opponent makes it to 2-2. EA you have become a joke, plain and simple.
The worst thing are the stats, They count for nothing and shud be removed, example, little skinny malard with a crap physical can hold off cafu and zico. I call bullshit on stats. Also bronze players have more speed and others are slowed, its a big scam.
    Scam is the best word to describe this game.
Just paid £13 for it as it’s on offer. Even at that price wish I hadn’t. What a load of shit it is this year.
When I play in legendary please tell me why my 84 rated GK slide tackles to save a shot. Never saved it. Also every shot the opponent takes it’s almost  an 90% chance it’s a goal😫
Bit late to the party but totally agree with all the hate on here. Literally zero effort from the developers. Lazy AF
I don’t agree, respectfully .
Don’t agree at all. To start with after getting the pre order I have struggled to like the game and have struggled massively with controlling my players.
Tonight I tried going back to an old elite one controller instead of my newer elite two and it was like a different game completely. So it turns out my controller doesn’t work properly.
Now I can control what I’m doing I think the game is great.
My review, 

Ea ceo wilson dont know shit about football 
Refs are racists even tho the game says no to racism.. 
As gk cm u get subbed every game cuz theres fuck all to do in game.., objectives for player cm is sp weird like "score at least 5 bycicle kicks" bro my player aint even a striker.. . 
They need to add hats for goalies in pro clubs. 
The same amount of hairstyles.
They should make carreer mode like 2k does.. 
But ah well ea dont give a shite. 
#1a pro league is underrated
Bunch of complainers the lot of you. You guys say this every year. Watch, when FC25 comes out, you’re all going to be praising 24 as the best game. Same shit every year lmao. 

Have you ever considered the possibility that you’re just bad at the new game and need to learn the new mechanics?
    "Here's a shit sandwich, learn how to eat it and enjoy it".
    I agree but tbh this year ea have narrowed the skill gap. You cant go trough middle its a fact u just have to abuse wingers and its annoying as fuck + defenders and defending is more op than ever before
The game is literally the opposite of your analysis. Fifa 23 was complete 🚮. Fc24 one of the best flowing fifa games in a while. 

It makes you actually be good at the game and understand the game of football to win. Unlike fifa 23 where it felt like there was a narrative behind every possession/goal, which completely ruined fifa 23 imo.
I’m not being funny but football is not free flowing or fun to play see you don’t want real football , guys like you want fantasy football I’ve worked you guys out because the more realistic a football game gets over time  the more you guys moan that’s why all FIFA games get more crap than they did when they were easy ! ! but these games are more realistic than 5 or 6 years ago , Yet you guys hate them why ? Because you guys suck !  The more realistic football gets the harder everything is ! But I’ve seen pros play this game and it was  like watching football I actually thought I was watching a real match for a few seconds once ! The way the ball moves the quick passing the movement of the players it’s like watching a game , And you say football should be free flowing no it isn’t you get tacked you get fouls you get all kinds of stoppages now sometimes you get free flowing football but not for the entire game only in bits ! You guys don’t want real football you just want arcade football where there is no hard tackling and everyone can score goals for fun and games finish 5-7 every match ! Well I want real football where you get boring games ! And exciting games , I don’t want you to say it’s a terrible game because you can’t score goals as easy as you could before because you should be tackled 97 % of the time because strikers don’t score every time they shoot they might not get 1 goal in 2 matches ? you don’t get goals every time you shoot this game is more real , Fact Is you console guys don’t like reality you want the games where you can score for fun like FIFA 97 ! Where it’s like basket ball I score the you score no that is not football I want to see real football I want this to be like watching any game in the PL I don’t need over the top goals everyone doing tricks every 4 seconds I want to pass the ball  to make space and then finish , This game becomes more and more like football everytime but most people eventually hate it because they don’t  want real football which is a very frustrating game for 90% of the time , I mean you miss chances you get tackled alot guys waste time shots don’t always go where you want them too you gotta make space work hard and kids don’t even know the game anyway , Kids who play football games are the worst judges of how real a football game is simply because they don’t really understand football, You know in real football you don’t pass forward you pass backwards so you can then move off the ball and make space for the next pass , It’s not what you do with the ball it’s what you do without it that matters but I see kids trying to do tricks just like Antony at Man Utd and you get tackled ! Then you get angry then you get frustrated and throw ya controller around ! You should pass it and move pass and move that is football. Make space for a good chance to finish and that takes skill and timing and most kids just want to beat 4 guys and blast it in ! Well that’s not football that’s fantasy football now you can beat 4 guys and score a goal like that on this game but ya not likely too unless you are using a player who could actually do that and he is playing at his best and you are a great player of the game then you can beat 4 guys and score , But football isn’t like that often , Sounds  to me like you want just a great football experience of dribbling and scoring incredible goals and ya too young to understand that is not football that is you wanting arcade action that makes you look good , Now if you watch the pros play this game you will see incredible football because they know how to play and they play like it’s a real game they pass and move they keep possession they don’t just run dribble and shoot and moan because they get tackled more than they did years ago, You go and watch the best in the world play this game and you will see end to end action but those guys are passing with intelligence and they play like pros , Most kids these days they get frustrated because they can’t even cross the ball and score headers from open play then they say you can’t score headers on this game ! I’m like no YOU can’t score headers on this game ! I can bang there it is 3-1 ,
Champions Is Fastweb than light
Why am I playing with a regular team like Ajax and I keep matching and having to play national teams.
So your saying it wouldn’t suit a skiller like me who loved Fifa 21 but detested 22?
    A skiller would probably like it still, as it rewards skill moves, chained skill moves another new mechanic.
Can someone please tell me is all matches in division rivals 8 mins long and is their a way to change this ?
I'm starting to see how fake this game is for an average player.

Tonight I was against a team worth like 40 million coin in div 8.  Thats like man city playing a non division team. Unfair, daft and shows how messed up the matching is. How is this even a fair match in a div 8? 

 Soo I contacted the guy and he said his in div 3 and did not know I was only div 8.  

No further comment,
    And this is one of the most biggest issues. I would go further and say that this game on current gen (PS5) with its Hypermotion V is not performing as it should, especially in online games as the complexity of Hypermotion V animation overloads the data exchange between the players.

I played since last week the PS4 version (without Hypermotion V) and I did not have anymore problems in online games. No pressing, no bad passes… it seems to be the game, which we all intend to play. Surely even the PS4 version is not perfect, but it is 1.000.000 times better playable than the PS5 version.
        Seems theirs big differences in gameplay. PC port is broke as animations cause lag ect. Cant use 144hz100hz on most pcs causes lag. Players screen size effects the game in a daft way. I changed to co-op view and instantly my players could move, no longer stuck in mud acting like trucks lolol.

But on a serious note. The EA servers don't seem to host the actual games, Just the information, Market info ect.  I'm 99% sure the home team is host and away team client connect.
            I have probably found a solution to fix a good connection on PS5 (but even for any other gaming console) and therefore to have a good gameplay in online games!

Configure the PS5 as DMZ, but block the UDP Port 5353 only for the PS5! For internet connection with low bandwidth you should give your PS5 a priority in order to avoid problems during online gaming like lag or delay.
                Good advice buddy. Wanna fix pc port? lololol
                    I think, that you have to put a gaming console as DMZ for that game. Maybe for a PC it should be different as a PC is not a closed system like a gaming console. On a PC you should have better possibilities to identify and open the necessary ports.

I can confirm that putting my PS5 as DMZ, my gameplay performance improved and the chaotic circumstances, which made the game unplayable disapeared.
                        Thanks buddy. Il check a few things out and its great to see you sorted it for PS5.
Had a new glitch hadn't seen before....when game paused and doing Team Management tasks, it was showing me my opponents team (and therefore he was seeing mine) and both of us no doubt messing with each other's lineups etc
completely agree, this is hands down the worst value game i have ever bought. i wont be buying fifa 25
yeh I thought id always be safe as a fifa player mainly enjoying manager mode. apparently not, oh well at least I never have to think about playing the most up to date game anymore
Not really . It's the best since FIFA 22 anyway
    Only graphics makes it very good
    You are obviously have no idea what a game is😂
        shitty opinion followed by smugness 101
    Idk bro, tbh I recently started playing fc24 and some shit that happens in the field is surreal bro, a lot of glitches that didn’t happen in fifa 22 or 23
        All the numbers in your comment added up to 69. Congrats!

Fifa 23 was the best game
    didnt fifa 23 get horrible reviews as well when it came out? this happens every time they make a new sports game. not just fifa. it gets called the "worst one yet" and then after everyone gets used to it they call the next one horrible once again
        Like it's not the exact same sport every in edition lmao
You can try again. I think EA just updated the new patch that fix defending better. Now i can tackle precisely and feel like defender got fixed better. They also nerf the hold r1 dribbling ( imo which is so stupid and not realistic) so it is good to play now
This is so true. Defenders are often in dream land. So so bad
The defenders are constantly on their heals, it makes breaks impossible to stop.  The game is essentially see who can score more.  The amount of cushion real Madrid gets is insane, how is Rodrygo the best player alive?
Unsure how you can disagree with almost everything. It’s a true fact, if you make a tackle it throws your defender half way across the pitch. Play styles don’t offer the game much more variety, it’s pointless to even have any players who don’t have 3/4 play styles…. They’re completely useless otherwise. You can say ‘skill issue’ but when players like myself in Div 2 and Div 1 are saying the game, it’s clearly not a skill issue. 

Everyone can just spam R1 dribble and walk past the entire defence in the box. The game is literally forcing everyone to not even try to defend, it’s forcing everyone to use A.I to do everything for them in regards to defending in the box. Is that how a game should be? 

There is literally no point playing a game if the A.I does the main things for you….
Same except for the content, but it's tough to make a real call on that just yet. The playstyles are awesome.
    As a premier league guy they’ve dropped a few nice cards for me. SBCs too. But coming from madden, the content is 100x better than the shit they were dropping
lol. What about now?
    Still enjoying the game. Feel like I’m finally starting to grasp some of the deeper gameplay mechanics and dribbling and all that. Been winning more games obviously I’ve been having fun. As a PL squad I wish they dropped more PL players instead of pointless Eridivese players like today lol. But whatever. I do almost every cheap SB just to do it. Did 30 of the 80+ SBC packs and got some good high overall fodder out of my pointless golds. W by EA for that.
        There isn't a single FIFA24 player who doesn't have grey hair yet due to all the bugs and unrealistic gameplay this game provides. Idk if you're coping but the game is absolute dogwater. Not to mention the pay2win aspect of it and the fact that you have to be a nolifer and you have to follow the meta in order to win. You don't even need skill to play this game anymore, just +W with Mbappe on the left wing and win. Also if you encounter a slight loss of package you instantly get disconnected and get punished for it instead of getting a pause like in other multiplayer games. And a fifa game doesn't even take that long for it to not have an auto pause option after a minimal package loss. Not to mention the amount of times the ref ends half / game in super advantageous situations, even decides not to give corner kicks and free kicks because of that. Defending is worse than any of the fifa games I've played so far, players literally freeze and do absolutely nothing. Players are faster on the ball than players off the ball which is absolute bullshit, etc. etc... I won't be buying next fifa for sure, even if it's for free, I've had enough of this ignorant and capitalistic organisation.
You’re clearly a pay to win player, as someone who has been playing this game avidly for YEARS, and was a consistent Div 3/2 player, the game has never been worse. It’s more glitches and broken OP AI controlled movement, tackles and auto-blocks than actual football, the amount of times people have gotten tackles on my players by genuinely phasing through my player, I cannot count. I have never seen more icons or 5m+ teams in my entire life, it’s more pay to win now than it has ever been. Plus, it’s scripted to all fuck, I literally have had goalkeepers either jump 5m into the air to save (what in reality) would be an impossible save, or they have been half way through a save animation in one direction, for the ball to deflect and then goalkeeper still saves it in the other direction. Easily the worst UT they’ve ever made in the 12 or so years of it being active. The ironic thing is, Andrew Wilson SLATED FIFA when parting ways. Burnt that bridge, for him to literally make the worst FIFA ever the first time they’re independent. I mean the company is CONTROLLED by an Aussie who doesn’t give a fuck about the sport, just the money it generates. In the FC24 announcement event, he literally talked about other sports and loving them 😂😂😂
    Which is why there should be more modes for bronze and silver teams.

Playing with all 70-80 players are a requirement could be endlessly fun for good players. But then again, those 5million icon teams, those are billions in fifa point purchase for EA. They would never change that.
Since when do you play Fifa ? I play it every year since 24 years and i can assure you this is by far the worst one.
Stop working for EA and get a decent job.
sorry, this is something i would write only if i woke up with paranoid schizo one day, the game is a total piece of garbage, complete mess, i had to stop playing it after a week
And the add to the point, I was a consistent Div 3/2 player, now it’s impossible for me to do ANYTHING in Div 5. Because everyone is pay to win
Yeah the whole new engine, new code, built from the ground up is what's needed but something EA won't do. There's a ton of legacy code from older FIFA games. Just adding layers on. Year to year release, they rely on that. A total rebuild would take several years, like when a developer is set to release a new game/IP and it takes them three years or so before it releases.

I find Konami's eFootball a better representation of simulation football.
It's a real chore, not fun at all
Yep. At least a balance between allowing AI defenders to still do their jobs, but also some manual control needed for advanced gamers. F23 was let AI defense do everything. FC24 is constantly switching.

On attack, the AI fully controls your attackers, and you cannot allow for any manual control on attack (impossible), as you are focused on dribbling etc, so why should defense be forced to be all manual switching just to do their basic jobs? Just their basic jobs, tracking players, staying mobile and active, plugging lanes , keeping their shape  etc.
    Yeah I agree , 23 was far to easy just sit there let the ai doit. This fida is almost un playable , got my cb marking a striker 15-20 yards deeper than any other defender playing them all on side takes one touch and hea out the game. Goal keeper call out is just as bugged
        EA needs to find the middle area between what F23 was and what FC24 is. They've gone full opposite in both games. And yeah, I didn't go in depth on the goalkeeping issues in FC24, so many areas of concern that weren't there in F23.
With my team is the opposite. CBs just come straight for the ball in a counter-attack scenario, leaving loads of space for the opp to run into. 

Scoring has been extremely difficult as well, for the opp GK does extreme saves in cases of rebounds, almost teleporting from one side to the other. And obviously, mine just lets every ball go through.
I found my bro, fifa 22 was one of the best in my opinion too
How about wasting time from the 5th minute  once they score an early goal from a cheesey angle. Gloating and passing the ball around, playing keep off, using goalkick glitch wheh behind to try to get a goal back, etc. The community sucks, immature ragers. And the gane itself is so arcade really.
Don't get me wrong.....FIFA 23 was very cheesey, exploitative. Slower paced players were unusable. It wasn't a good football simulation, but at the very least you could say it was fun to play because it was more free flowing by nature.

I'm not saying FC24 is rubbish and unplayable, but it is an ordeal....mainly due to the constant turnover of the ball due to the bump in tackling and rough-housing and all the intercepts, ricochets, etc due to the nerfed passing. Having to excessively dribble is also a chore.

And just in terms of structure or coding of the game....play styles spoils the player ratings. It is emphasized over player ratings, because top players who lack a specific ability are worse at it than lesser players who have that ability. They could've just added new categories in player ratings like Blocking, Flair, Bruising, etc etc, and just had players rated across those various categories to get a difference. Player ratings on their own work really well.
I feel your pain. The other day in Seasons, I couldn't get a single win, tumbled from div5 to div10. Next day, couldn't lose, from div10 to div5 again. Started FC24 couldn't lose, then lost like 50 in a row. Next day, win a lot more. Next day, back to losing every game. Etc. And it's always silly scripted things, a bounce back, constant hitting posts, players letting balls go by them, taking air swings on one-twos, multiple red cards while they get away with MMA takedowns, etc.

The worst thing about EAs game is all the mechanisms running underneath as I mentioned in the OP. The game is far too locked in to them, too much scripting happens. Aspects like tackling, intercepts, playstyles, etc, need to be nerfed/tweaked in multiple patches just to make the game breathe a little because it's far too gridlocked a game out of the box.

There are many things going on underneath the surface of the game code that affect every moment, the outcome of possessions, the outcome of games. It seldom feels organic or free will-like. Things allowed to happen all game preordained, or things not allowed to happen all game preordained ... headers, through balls, AI defensive shapes, fineese shots, bounce of the ball, etc etc.
It's far more frustrating (in a bad way) thats for sure.
    Day 2 and luvit...I just need to hold the shoot button that little bit longer than usual..absolutely flying on Leeds Utd save...9 wins 1 draw and 2 losses and top of the pops after 12 league games..
Respectfully, the gameplay might be the worst I’ve ever seen, players don’t move off the ball, constant glitching when your defending against the CPU, the gameplay itself might be the worst part often he game tbh. Also your players are so fucking slow, Harry Maguire caught Ousmane Dembele on my career mode the other day from behind and that was the last straw.
It's because people love football, and video games, and there aren't any/many options out there. eFootball is a decent alternative gameplay-wise, but it lacks content and official teams, so it has to be EA's game...pretty much a monopoly.

Hopefully, FIFAs stand alone game is a genuine challenger to EAs FC game.
    Also the game is very promoted by streamers who have special accounts made by ea to pack a lot of good players to influence the viewers to buy the game. Indeed its a monopoly and the enterpricing is huge. Even if you say to yourself that you won t buy the next game, the fact that you love football and you are competitive forces you to buy it. Its a vicios cycle
At this point I totally agree with you. Every year the first couple months are really worth to play because of new game style and everyone doesn’t have a fast card yet. Now with all of fast pace cards release which i think it make no sense is killing the market. Im done w Ut this year, just build my team around fav players.
Yeah it's over the top, you can't just try to defend the player with the ball but two or three off ball players at all times. Don't have to do that when you are attacking, so there's no justification for that imbalance.
Wow that's exactly how I felt, also the overall gameplay is really sluggish, the extra microseconds each players take to make a pass makes the pace slower, even when I press the pass before the player receives the ball. 

Btw having owned all fifa games, which is your no1?
    I liked 17 because it was the first time in a long time I felt they put some effort into something other than FUT. Career mode was broadened and of course it was the first time we had the Alex Hunter story mode.
If you're on console, you only need to subscribe to playstation plus or xbox gamepass to be able to play online.
    and if I'm on pc?
        Then you'll need to subscribe to EA Play
            Don't think so, PC should be free to play online (I do)
Fill in the blank lol
It’s garbage save your money
I think there's something more sinister to it. It's the "pay to win" in effect. 

People who spend real money in the game get rewarded more than people who don't. They score goals with every long shot, never miss. Their players are incredibly faster. Your AI defenders decide to rush up and out of position all the time. The players you swap to are always the wrong choice. They can MMA you all over the park no fouls but you breathe on them and it's cards. Their GKs save everything. Their players get all the rebounds. Your own shots suddenly always miss and hit the posts. Etc etc.

You can tell them apart because they do that flapping bird celebration which isn't free. And they play out their celebrations and goal replays extra long that you can't skip, but they can cancel your own celebrations.
Theyre essentially the same....same base engine, animations, arcade movements....but EA keeps adding new shit mechanics and ideas like Play Styles and Precision Passing, and messing with the balance of things....so the games generally get progressively worse.
Scam is the best word to describe this game.

Yeah I agree , 23 was far to easy just sit there let the ai doit. This fida is almost un playable , got my cb marking a striker 15-20 yards deeper than any other defender playing them all on side takes one touch and hea out the game. Goal keeper call out is just as bugged
    EA needs to find the middle area between what F23 was and what FC24 is. They've gone full opposite in both games. And yeah, I didn't go in depth on the goalkeeping issues in FC24, so many areas of concern that weren't there in F23.
Day 2 and luvit...I just need to hold the shoot button that little bit longer than usual..absolutely flying on Leeds Utd save...9 wins 1 draw and 2 losses and top of the pops after 12 league games..
Also the game is very promoted by streamers who have special accounts made by ea to pack a lot of good players to influence the viewers to buy the game. Indeed its a monopoly and the enterpricing is huge. Even if you say to yourself that you won t buy the next game, the fact that you love football and you are competitive forces you to buy it. Its a vicios cycle
I liked 17 because it was the first time in a long time I felt they put some effort into something other than FUT. Career mode was broadened and of course it was the first time we had the Alex Hunter story mode.
and if I'm on pc?
    Then you'll need to subscribe to EA Play
        Don't think so, PC should be free to play online (I do)
Seems theirs big differences in gameplay. PC port is broke as animations cause lag ect. Cant use 144hz100hz on most pcs causes lag. Players screen size effects the game in a daft way. I changed to co-op view and instantly my players could move, no longer stuck in mud acting like trucks lolol.

But on a serious note. The EA servers don't seem to host the actual games, Just the information, Market info ect.  I'm 99% sure the home team is host and away team client connect.
    I have probably found a solution to fix a good connection on PS5 (but even for any other gaming console) and therefore to have a good gameplay in online games!

Configure the PS5 as DMZ, but block the UDP Port 5353 only for the PS5! For internet connection with low bandwidth you should give your PS5 a priority in order to avoid problems during online gaming like lag or delay.
        Good advice buddy. Wanna fix pc port? lololol
            I think, that you have to put a gaming console as DMZ for that game. Maybe for a PC it should be different as a PC is not a closed system like a gaming console. On a PC you should have better possibilities to identify and open the necessary ports.

I can confirm that putting my PS5 as DMZ, my gameplay performance improved and the chaotic circumstances, which made the game unplayable disapeared.
                Thanks buddy. Il check a few things out and its great to see you sorted it for PS5.
shitty opinion followed by smugness 101

Like it's not the exact same sport every in edition lmao
There isn't a single FIFA24 player who doesn't have grey hair yet due to all the bugs and unrealistic gameplay this game provides. Idk if you're coping but the game is absolute dogwater. Not to mention the pay2win aspect of it and the fact that you have to be a nolifer and you have to follow the meta in order to win. You don't even need skill to play this game anymore, just +W with Mbappe on the left wing and win. Also if you encounter a slight loss of package you instantly get disconnected and get punished for it instead of getting a pause like in other multiplayer games. And a fifa game doesn't even take that long for it to not have an auto pause option after a minimal package loss. Not to mention the amount of times the ref ends half / game in super advantageous situations, even decides not to give corner kicks and free kicks because of that. Defending is worse than any of the fifa games I've played so far, players literally freeze and do absolutely nothing. Players are faster on the ball than players off the ball which is absolute bullshit, etc. etc... I won't be buying next fifa for sure, even if it's for free, I've had enough of this ignorant and capitalistic organisation.
