        We need to find some gears, guys!
            Heli heli heli heli heli heli !!!
                Shit we need lowgrade.
                    Wait, can anyone make ammo yet?
                        And meds guys! I have like 0 syringes...
    Man. I've stayed up far longer than I wanted to trying to find things like garage door and reinforced window glass.
        *sun rising*
Man, I gotta go out and get gears and scrap if I want to put up some garage doors and keep myself from getting raided.
*proceeds to get ambushed by zergs dropping on you in scrap Helis towards the end of your scrap run on your way back to the base*
            Or get "onlined" by a zerg while you've been spending 30 minutes farming barrels and then also even lose what you collected in that run because you get sniped by a metal guy protecting the raid from the top of your own base
                Ah, you talk from experience
    Nah lol il make my base with 5 loot rooms and like 10 double doors in like 1  hour in game, til they find tc room or main loot they need like 16 satchels min lol. Soo im good
        We don't talk in satchel-metric system here.

        That‚Äôs because you play on boosted

                Yeah but the dude said in a hour.
            [removed]
                I mean if he is going to brag about he can get 10 scrap double doors in a day he should at least say it‚Äôs on modded to clear up confusion
                    [removed]
                        For 1 hour it kinda is
                            [removed]
                                you just farm full fast make 2 furncae fast pop in metal than go farm stuff to rec for frags and offc onlyyy rec big amounts at like bandit camp
                                    sure if ya got lucky its doable but weel 1 2 and half hours is norm
                                    and offc if you solo you dont need crap like code locks
        Except that 16 satchels is basically nothing for a big base like that
            only prob the find inside like 4k stone 1k frags and 6k wood and 3 bows maybe 1 revolver ahahahh no sulf
                Lmao Id be so mad
Can‚Äôt even play rust right now. Can‚Äôt keep up with nonessential workers
    It‚Äôs mostly the kids who don‚Äôt have school. They put in like 12 hours a day. I‚Äôve been rocket raided 12 hours after a fresh wipe. So lame.
        Me and my buddies all work in hospitals and no matter what day we decide to play always get offlined so just gave up for now.
            there should be a rule where you cant offline essential workers during quarantine.
                Imagine coming home from a 12 hour night shift in the intensive care unit, only to find out that someone has offline destroyed your 2v1 that took about 6 hours to build because people absolutely love going out of their way to kill nakeds.
            Me too. Pivoted over to MW where a flood of sluggish freemium console nawbs are easy picking. I've never KD 2.0'd so much.

Miss you Rust bb. Please give us a worthwhile update bb.
                You guys should really play tarkov in the meantime. It's very similar in feeling I think, but you don't need to be on 24/7
                    This is so true, tarkov has my fiery love, one which started with rust.
                    Tarkov inventory management is too much for me to get into
                    I came here from Tarkov. Definitely a similar feel. Been enjoying both but learning towards rust.
        Rocket raided by full metal armour, aks, rockets and explosive bullets. Ahhhhhh fresh wipes.
        12 hours? Those are rookie numbers.
        The game has no balance. Whoever nolifes the hardest wins. Its unsustainable and will die off.
            I don‚Äôt even play to ‚Äúwin‚Äù anymore. I‚Äôm happy if I can just go have some fun without being raided by day 2. I don‚Äôt even try to go for raids anymore.
                I stopped playing over a year ago. Too many good games out there to waste my time getting raided 3 hours into a wipe by a 9 man zerg of screeching kids.
            People said the same 4 years ago and the game is at it's peak
        3am for me when I had the day off the next day. 30/200 people on the server and they went around to raid everybody. Guess what server was dead the rest of the week?
            Guess who fucking cares... Not them guys they switched to a Monday wipe and rolled everyone on that too
                Yep, and my favorite sunday wipe is now dead for 2 weeks :(
                    So sad ;(
        Ive been playing 18 hours a day
            That's not healthy, also same
    I have a buddy who I hide I play Rust from because he never puts in the work.

Hate people who ask for bullets but never even mine.
        Then they bitch when you tell them to farm.
    Just quit lol :)
Im so glad I quit Rust a few months ago. Cant imagine getting offlined every time I go to bed because I have work and the kids are sitting at home during quarantine.
    It‚Äôs terrible right now. They put in like 12 hours a day and are ticket raiding stone 2x2 bases by day 2 for ‚Äúfun.‚Äù
        If you have a big enough group and enough resources, it's really fun to just run in a line and take out every base you see. That tends to be more of a day-before-wipe thing though.
        pvp*

                [deleted]
                    Then day 3 of wipe "omg y iz server ded?",
                    It's not like we're a 8 man group. Just a 3 man. What are we suppose to raid the 8+ man groups? You're poor 2x2 isn't going to take a long time to get back up and if you're living in such a shitty base who are you to complain about getting raided?
                        pick on somebody your own size, or you could try a challenge.  beating up offline solos to enlarge your ego doesnt do shit.
                            You think offline solos live in 2x2's? Yeah maybe some do but majority have groups inside it you dumb idiot.  Besides do you think everybody esps and can see how many people are inside a base? Youre so delusional it fucking hurts.
                                Im not going to insult you, but believe me when I say that absolutely nobody thinks you're right when you speak with that attitude, everything you've said thus far just makes me believe you are not even old enough to be on reddit. Why are you so mad?
                                    He's not wrong. Most rust players have communication issues.

If it has a Code Lock on the front door and close to my base, it's getting raided. No matter what the size. That's been our rule of thumb.
    It hasn‚Äôt been to bad, I‚Äôve been offlined once during quarantine but that was day 6 or wipe.
        Alright for some, been offlined every single night at 7am by russians on EU Medium 2
            On a uk server, solo only. We have an unwritten rule. Alaways go after the russians. We all make a concerted effort to target russians becuse they just got too powerful offlining all the sulfee bases.
            Hey me too! Ha
            Learn to make your base as expensive as possible. Dont log off till you get garage door. 

Make sure you're never profit and when a zerg raids you, they better get back to farming
 :)
                always log off out of an empty base if u can üòÅ we used to hide the good stuff in stashes around the compound...noone ever looks
                    ESP players do. 

Last wipe, some friend who lived in a compounded cave base got offlined. 1 week into wipe. 

They used around 70 rockets and they had gotten a lot of metal and guns to "profit", but they didnt get a single boom or gp back. 

It turned out;my friend left like 1k explosives in his exterior stone Tcs that nobody ever tries to break
                        not a bad plan.   i have a buddy who builds a big compound and lives in the external tcs lol my favourite fuck you base is the 9x9 1x1s....81 singular bases...u find any loot you deserve it lol
            Amazing that you know at exactly what hour they offline raided you... every single time .. teach us!
                If you remember what time you log off, when you spawn in dead, it says how long you were alive for, add that on to when you logged off and you'll get the time you were killed :/
                    So you kill yourself before you log off every day? I always assumed that timer doesnt run while you're offline.
                        Bruh, they killed me when they raided so obviously I'm gonna die, and it says you were alive for X amount of time
                            Yes but if you didnt die right before you log off it would be hard to pinpoint how late it was since to count it, you need to know the time of your previous death and count the time alive with that. Weird how I'm explaining this to you now lol
            Playing on huge pop servers will do that.
            that's just so true
        Weak competition.
    That's the main reason I gave up on it. Takes way too much time...
        I bought the game as i was super excited to play. Quickly realised it's a full time job and pointless to play unless you're absolutely no life-ing it
    Switch to a modded PVE server, you‚Äôll have a blast!
        There is literally nothing to do in this game without pvp. It is a pvp game!
            Pve servers can be fun to fuck around on for a few days every few months. But yeah there isn't much to do. Some have pvp enabled zones at monuments and other places though
Still better than having a base when you logoff and none when you get back on. Massive IQ play from your friends, cant get offlined if you don't have a base.
    Losing entire base sucks balls. I seal in tc on my starter base, putting entire months upkeep in. It ensures that if you do get offlined at least you have a hone to go to.
    cant get offlined if you dont go offline
    ppl have no manners anymore...they used to leave you your base at least..
now they all tcd and doored up n youre fucked
Exactly why I quit Rust. Hahah jk I quit my Job and school.
Every single one
Drunk and stoned if anything a burden
The clock in the background the reason why this meme is so great
I always stay up all night wipe day just to hit oil rig when the pop is less because sometimes I solo vanilla servers and it's not fun getting a scrap heli full of 8 people to come counter a solo
You didn‚Äôt need to call me out like that chief
High af
Bunker up son!
getting DB raided 45 minutes in for your 1.3k wood and 600 uncooked metal lmao.  Get DC'd to wait in a 30 person queue....if you are lucky.... mmmmm wipe day.  From what I've experienced so far on official as solo, its much more fun to join in 1 week or 2 later to scavenge decayed/raided bases.
True fact : I'm reading this at 5:21AM after a successful and juicy raid
a mix of EU and NA players work best in my opinion, your able to have coverage of ur base 24/7 and have a REASONABLE sleep schedule
Every day after wile
This is why I stopped playing Rust
For me it was always the raids where "we just need one more door"
Who goes to bed at 5
I play on super small servers now because i almost never get offlined, its fun
I'm the last guy online making sheet metal doors and upgrading the base while everyone else already went to sleep and doesnt care, I know that feel.
Bruh who needs a base when you can just have 20 small stashes
That's why I left my old clan now I just play for fun instead of farming and upkeeping your compound everyday for hours
y'all need better base bitches imo
nahhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[deleted]
    wow bro i‚Äôm so impressed i bet you have a huge cock
    I‚Äôm the guy eating pickles at that time.
    On your 10x server...
    Nobody gives a shit you fucking sweaty.
If u bc ant get a base down in 12 hrs ur epithet sub 100 hrs or rly shit
    If you actually can‚Äôt take a joke, you‚Äôre either a cringe sweaty tryhard or you‚Äôre autistic

Rocket raided by full metal armour, aks, rockets and explosive bullets. Ahhhhhh fresh wipes.
12 hours? Those are rookie numbers.
The game has no balance. Whoever nolifes the hardest wins. Its unsustainable and will die off.
    I don‚Äôt even play to ‚Äúwin‚Äù anymore. I‚Äôm happy if I can just go have some fun without being raided by day 2. I don‚Äôt even try to go for raids anymore.
        I stopped playing over a year ago. Too many good games out there to waste my time getting raided 3 hours into a wipe by a 9 man zerg of screeching kids.
    People said the same 4 years ago and the game is at it's peak
3am for me when I had the day off the next day. 30/200 people on the server and they went around to raid everybody. Guess what server was dead the rest of the week?
    Guess who fucking cares... Not them guys they switched to a Monday wipe and rolled everyone on that too
        Yep, and my favorite sunday wipe is now dead for 2 weeks :(
            So sad ;(
Ive been playing 18 hours a day
    That's not healthy, also same
Then they bitch when you tell them to farm.
If you have a big enough group and enough resources, it's really fun to just run in a line and take out every base you see. That tends to be more of a day-before-wipe thing though.

            Then day 3 of wipe "omg y iz server ded?",
            It's not like we're a 8 man group. Just a 3 man. What are we suppose to raid the 8+ man groups? You're poor 2x2 isn't going to take a long time to get back up and if you're living in such a shitty base who are you to complain about getting raided?
                pick on somebody your own size, or you could try a challenge.  beating up offline solos to enlarge your ego doesnt do shit.
                    You think offline solos live in 2x2's? Yeah maybe some do but majority have groups inside it you dumb idiot.  Besides do you think everybody esps and can see how many people are inside a base? Youre so delusional it fucking hurts.
                        Im not going to insult you, but believe me when I say that absolutely nobody thinks you're right when you speak with that attitude, everything you've said thus far just makes me believe you are not even old enough to be on reddit. Why are you so mad?
                            He's not wrong. Most rust players have communication issues.

If it has a Code Lock on the front door and close to my base, it's getting raided. No matter what the size. That's been our rule of thumb.
Alright for some, been offlined every single night at 7am by russians on EU Medium 2
    On a uk server, solo only. We have an unwritten rule. Alaways go after the russians. We all make a concerted effort to target russians becuse they just got too powerful offlining all the sulfee bases.
    Hey me too! Ha
    Learn to make your base as expensive as possible. Dont log off till you get garage door. 

Make sure you're never profit and when a zerg raids you, they better get back to farming
 :)
        always log off out of an empty base if u can üòÅ we used to hide the good stuff in stashes around the compound...noone ever looks
            ESP players do. 

Last wipe, some friend who lived in a compounded cave base got offlined. 1 week into wipe. 

They used around 70 rockets and they had gotten a lot of metal and guns to "profit", but they didnt get a single boom or gp back. 

It turned out;my friend left like 1k explosives in his exterior stone Tcs that nobody ever tries to break
                not a bad plan.   i have a buddy who builds a big compound and lives in the external tcs lol my favourite fuck you base is the 9x9 1x1s....81 singular bases...u find any loot you deserve it lol
    Amazing that you know at exactly what hour they offline raided you... every single time .. teach us!
        If you remember what time you log off, when you spawn in dead, it says how long you were alive for, add that on to when you logged off and you'll get the time you were killed :/
            So you kill yourself before you log off every day? I always assumed that timer doesnt run while you're offline.
                Bruh, they killed me when they raided so obviously I'm gonna die, and it says you were alive for X amount of time
                    Yes but if you didnt die right before you log off it would be hard to pinpoint how late it was since to count it, you need to know the time of your previous death and count the time alive with that. Weird how I'm explaining this to you now lol
    Playing on huge pop servers will do that.
    that's just so true
Weak competition.
I bought the game as i was super excited to play. Quickly realised it's a full time job and pointless to play unless you're absolutely no life-ing it
There is literally nothing to do in this game without pvp. It is a pvp game!
    Pve servers can be fun to fuck around on for a few days every few months. But yeah there isn't much to do. Some have pvp enabled zones at monuments and other places though
Heli heli heli heli heli heli !!!
    Shit we need lowgrade.
        Wait, can anyone make ammo yet?
            And meds guys! I have like 0 syringes...
Or get "onlined" by a zerg while you've been spending 30 minutes farming barrels and then also even lose what you collected in that run because you get sniped by a metal guy protecting the raid from the top of your own base
    Ah, you talk from experience

    Yeah but the dude said in a hour.

    I mean if he is going to brag about he can get 10 scrap double doors in a day he should at least say it‚Äôs on modded to clear up confusion

            For 1 hour it kinda is
                [removed]
                    you just farm full fast make 2 furncae fast pop in metal than go farm stuff to rec for frags and offc onlyyy rec big amounts at like bandit camp
                        sure if ya got lucky its doable but weel 1 2 and half hours is norm
                        and offc if you solo you dont need crap like code locks
only prob the find inside like 4k stone 1k frags and 6k wood and 3 bows maybe 1 revolver ahahahh no sulf
    Lmao Id be so mad
there should be a rule where you cant offline essential workers during quarantine.
    Imagine coming home from a 12 hour night shift in the intensive care unit, only to find out that someone has offline destroyed your 2v1 that took about 6 hours to build because people absolutely love going out of their way to kill nakeds.
Me too. Pivoted over to MW where a flood of sluggish freemium console nawbs are easy picking. I've never KD 2.0'd so much.

Miss you Rust bb. Please give us a worthwhile update bb.
    You guys should really play tarkov in the meantime. It's very similar in feeling I think, but you don't need to be on 24/7
        This is so true, tarkov has my fiery love, one which started with rust.
        Tarkov inventory management is too much for me to get into
        I came here from Tarkov. Definitely a similar feel. Been enjoying both but learning towards rust.
