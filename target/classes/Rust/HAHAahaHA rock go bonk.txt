[[HAHAahaHA rock go bonk]]





Me with a building plan and eoka trying to steal from furnaces
    Every rust youtuber within 4 minutes of a video
        “BEST SOLO START EVER!” “ROCK TO AK IN 2 SECONDS!”
        “I stumbled across a compound”........ that’s all of welyns videos lol.
            And that's why I stopped watching.
                cause he doesn't farm solos?

                    Bro what
                    Yeah.... no.
You clearly havent watch enardo wrecked a compound with rocks, spears and a zerg lol
    He is amazing with spears but super toxic to young players I hate that shit
        Oh man, I watched a few of his videos and out of fucking nowhere this dude goes ballistic on some kid that just crossed his path.
        Maybe he has seen his fair share of pre-pubescent children yelling the n-word with the hard R. Don't blame him.
            I’ve been gaming for 20 years with 2100 hrs specifically in Rust and I’ve never felt the need to be toxic to 10 year old kids like he is in some of his videos. And usually the kids that come at you toxic immediately calm down if you just talk to them normal. Ask them if they need any help with anything, offer them a gun or bow and tell them to try and be helpful to other players instead of being a dick and honestly they usually chill out
            in all of my 200 rust hours i’ve never heard someone drop a n-word somehow. maybe it’s just me but i think that’s less common than you make it out to be
                Damn man share your servers, see it alot, maybe because I spend so much time near the beach with other nakeds.
                    damn i usually run on any official servers that aren’t full but i’m mostly inland so maybe that’s the difference
                It’s extremely common seeing the N word on EU server which is where I play 95% of the time, typically full pop official servers seem to be the most toxic since they aren’t really policed like community servers with multiple admins who are active
        Prepubescent children shouldn’t be playing foreskin survival.
        Its an r18 game mate
Bonk is my new favourite word.

    nincompoop.
        :(
One time I rocked a metal guy to death. Poor dude just kept missing his shots
     A well warranted kit
        Yeah but I felt bad. Was probably the poor dudes first am set
            The first server I played on somoene gave me a free all and c4, it was like a noon server that had like 10 ppl.
What am I missing here? Do rocks do damage to compounds??
    yes ultimate raid tool better than rocket
        BONK
        infinity% sulfur profit
    148 rocks and you can get through a sheet metal door. 

2 hours solo, divide that up by your group number and you've got yourself an eco raid.
Soon the sound on bonk on another's head will be ringing true across the rustyverse
Enardo \*nervous sweat\*
