Why play the game when you can spend 20 hours a day spamming the sell button at bandit camp xd
    Years of playing RuneScape have prepared him for this moment.
        That gp ain’t gonna earn itself
        r/unexpectedrunescape
        I respect it.
        Runescape players have more respect for themselves
            I wouldn’t be so sure. 3 tick mining is pretty swet
                Bro have you tried 2 tick harpooning, that shit is ass
        Take my upvote and award XD
            Thanks!
    What about the time spent getting horse stamina down so they eat
        Thats a thing?
            He knows his shit.
        Not required any more. They eat for health now as well as stam.
            Health degenerates over time. If stamina is full, they won't eat, and health will keep dropping until it dies
                Yes, but FP changed it so horses now also eat for health.
                    No, it hasn't been changed. Your horse will not eat when it has full stamina.
 
Show me which patch they updated it in?
They fixed the trough not slowing down horse decay midway through 2021, but that's about it
[https://rust.facepunch.com/changes/1](https://rust.facepunch.com/changes/1)
        Mine will only eat now when there used. One the stamina is full the stop eating.
        Pretty sure this was patched a couple months back.
    Macros my guy.
How do u get them up there lol
    Yea wait what
    Ramps probably
        Oh nevermind, OP said he did it by an elevator

    Elevator
        [deleted]
            look closely toop of the picture person who took the screenshot is in the elevator. he probably places triangle floors to move horses and removed them afterwards
            The guy taking the pic is in the elevator, they prob take a horse up and place foundations and destroy after getting in?
                100%
                    50%.
You place floors. Not foundations 🙃
            A rust player would say this XD
On a modded sever where horse shit is instant refil.
    that makes a lot more sense lol
    This is the only way this makes sense. The economy on that server must be shit as a result.
        username
        "The economy" most wipes last 3 days with good pop on modded servers. You don't have time to install an economy
        There cant be no economy on survivors servers
    Ah ok that seems much more reasonable, they should decrease the cooldown on poop selling just a bit but I like the modded idea of just letting you go crazy
        we friens? heat from fire?
            it’s pronounced blow-hai 

:>

            no no, fire from heat,,,
        No the cooldowns are fine as is. Groups were literally crashing electricity, and water to produce cloth pre nerf. I would absolutely hate to see what happens to a server with mass poop farming.
            Most 2x servers have unlimited fertilizer selling. It’s rare to see horse bases and you never see them other than right after force.
    What server?
        West Coast Rust 2x 9/01
    Pm server name pls
        West Coast Rust 2x 9/01
I'm paraphrasing Spoonkid here but.. "stop selling poop and play the damn game!"
Sigma grindset
I don't think Bandit Camp manure buyer recharges fast enough for that.
    He said in another comment that theres no vender cooldown on his server
    He didnt actually make it that far to figure that part out....
        Its a modded server mate
            Then no one gives a fuck mate. Might as well play on a trash as server that gives free kits.
                More people play modded then vanilla cope kid
                    Of course they do, because modded includes battlefield servers and build servers.... so that is a bullshit misdirection attempt against someone smarter than you.

Play what you like, but dont try to lie.
                        Take those servers out and still more people play modded lol nice try tho
How many horses I found 40 end game or 20 to start is the way
your base is a toilet you lookin like poop in it
the ilmango rust poop farm haha
Peak boring.
That's ass backwards crazy
holy shit
Kind of a shit post if you ask me
but don't the horses lose health over time anyway?
    Not if they eat
Including free shower of Arizona water
gacha farm 🤔
(s)crap
Pretty sure Dafran was the first to do this, two months ago.
    No. This was a thing over a year ago.
Does all the poop just fall to the bottom floor too?
    Yep!
        This design is very human
Must be stinky in there
100k scrap and your horse farm is only stone?
If you sat at trader uncontested all day it would only get you 30kish scrap, literal overkill
Haven’t played in a while but it seems something regarding horse poop replaced the hemp farm scrap meta? NICE RUST- sick game
Holy. Shit
This looks illegal, lol.
Literally unless bandit has unlimited stock such as modded .... It's not 100K scrap a day 🤣
Most be a lot of fun spending hours a day clicking on a vending machine collecting scrap that most people don't give a shit about after the first 2-3 days of the wipe.
How do you even get the horses up there lmao
Amazing
[deleted]
    But you fan buy comps with scrap
And trade with scrap
And gamble with scrap
And warm your empty rust heart with scrap
        You can buy gp With scrap
            "...And you can trade with scrap..."
                Since when is buying same as trading?
                    Where do you buy GP?
Actual shitlords
So this is why I can't find a damn horse when I need it
10/10 wipe, sitting in bandit for 10 hours selling poop
Rust au servers looking for team mates add on discord kouki#9877
Get a life nerd
Get a life jesus Christ
Dystopian nightmare
What server, I’d like to take a tour and see it for myself lol
Horse👍
Juan..?
Takes you all day to sell it so what’s the point?
I applaud the amount of work you put into it! All the different levels, lighting, you really went all out!
Stop shitposting
Are you stuck at bandit camp your whole wipe?
Yes sir I'll take the horse on the 4th level 2nd from the right.
